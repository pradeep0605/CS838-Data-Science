The cover blurb says, \"Der Verlag \u00fcbernimmt keine Haftung f\u00fcr eventuell verloren gegangene Personen.\" (\"The publishers assume no responsibility for readers who disappear,\" essentially. It's all about getting lost in books. . .<---F>this time more literally than usual</---F>. They can laugh all they want. It happens.) Incredible! I mean, what's not to like. It's a narrative about bibliophilia. Not just the stories out of books,<---M> which play a big role</---M>, especially in Vol. 1. . .but also, all the physical trappings of books. (The main adult point-of-view character is a bookbinder; secondary adult point-of-view characters are an author and a book collector; minor characters include a handful of book illuminators. If you Google for character names you find out that a handful of them are names of early scribes from St. Gallen. For a medievalist like me this is a delightful Easter egg, and it's hardly the only one.) Each chapter begins with a quotation from a book (the citations chosen vary interestingly between the English and German versions of Vols. 1 & 2 [and presumably will also in Vol. 3 -- the English version is due later this year], though they are probably 75% matches; I wouldn't be surprised if Funke picked the English set as well -- she's clearly a big Anglophile). The range of the quotes is impressive, from (in the German version) Mark Twain to Paul Celan to C. S. Lewis to Matthias Claudius to J. M. Barrie to Salman Rushdie to Umberto Eco to Schiller (_Die R\u00e4uber_ of course. There are marvelous robbers in the story, with all of the same conflicting agendas as the ones in Schiller*) and a host of others. *There's a definite kinship to the robbers in Astrid Lindgren, too. The themes are Big: social justice for the downtrodden; families with all their complications (most of the characters are on the moody/passionate side; misunderstanding between close kin happens repeatedly); self-sacrifice to save others weaker than oneself; the meaning death gives to life. (Funke's husband Rolf was dying of cancer as she wrote Tintentod, and it shows. In a good way.) Many readers' favorite character is Staubfinger (Dustfinger), the \"fire-dancer\" street performer who thinks he has no courage; but mine is Mortimer, the bookbinder, whose innocent heart (his symbol isn't a unicorn by accident) and empathy for the oppressed takes him into mortal danger multiple times (I can count five times from this volume without even thinking hard). Okay, there's a bit of \"mild-mannered Clark Kent\" going on here, but it's a nice archetype; and Mortimer's hero alter-ego, and what he finds he is capable of, will take your breath away. (I can't remember the last time I _forgot to breathe_ while reading.) As one of the other reviewers says, Dude. I'll even say Duuuuuuuuuuuuuude. What are they called in English? Inkheart, Inkspell, <+++>Inkdeath</+++>. What are they called in German? Inkheart, Inkblood, <+++>Inkdeath</+++>. Go figure. It's another Sorcerer's Stone, as I figure it. But don't let that get in your way.

She was an integral character in the first two books, but it seemed like she played a smaller, less important role in this book. Was her purpose in the story just to read aloud the few things Fenoglio actually did write? Overall, the way her character was handled was a let down. 2) Farid annoyed me to death. He seems so childish, even though he really would've been considered a man at his age during those times. I just can't get his narrow-minded obsession with Dustfinger. I do like Dustfinger's character and all, but it's like he's the only thing on Farid's mind. 3) I think that Doria should have been fleshed out more, or introduced earlier, if Funke was going to make him into Meggie's new love interest. I just don't see how/why she fell in love with him, other than the fact that he was around more often than Farid and paid her more attention. I mean, what about his personality did she love? Why should we as the readers think this pairing makes sense? 4) Going back to Meggie's role, I really think she should have saved the day instead of Jacopo. I mean, he was a minor character and disliked by everyone and he was a total brat. Why would he be the one to save the day in the end? I understand that things weren't going his way, so he turned against his grandfather, but it still seemed odd and out-of-place to me. 5) The Black Prince did nothing in the book. He was injured and/or recovering during the vast majority of his scenes. I think he should have played a bigger role also, instead of some of the more minor characters coming to the forefront. 6) Orpheus never got his just desserts. I really wanted someone to take him out, but he just disappeared to the north. In reality, I think they would have wanted to go after him to make sure he never tried to mess with them again. 7) I really don't get why they stayed. They suffered a lot in the Inkworld. I would've wanted to go home and Fenoglio was still around to write them a way back into their own world. There was no reason why Doria couldn't have gone with, since he seemed fascinated by what Meggie told him about her world. It just seemed weird to me that they all stayed. 8) It was too long. I think they could've easily cut 50-100 pages at least. Anyway, I did enjoy the trilogy as a whole, but my favorite book is still Inkheart . I actually think that this one was the weakest of the bunch. ...more The German title for the second book in this series is TINTENBLUT or INKBLOOD. Why it became INKSPELL in the US is a mystery (my guess is it was a marketing decision --- spell is a lot less scary than blood). Having now read the final book in the series, I see why that original title was so apt and think it was very unfortunate that it was changed. But back to this book. It is dense, dark, and rich with ideas. I found it totally engrossing. The story picks up where the previous volume left off.

It is dense, dark, and rich with ideas. I found it totally engrossing. The story picks up where the previous volume left off. In the world of the INKHEART book. Who tells the story? Who writes the story? Can the story be changed? Can death (or the White Ladies, in this story) be stymied? What is love? Meggie, the feisty heroine of the first two books, is here trying to determine what love is. She was in love with Farid in the last book. What happens in this one? Do they go riding off happily into the sunset? And what about other loves? Farid's for Dustfinger? Resa's for Mo? Mo's for the Bluejay (trick comment, that one)? Orpheus for ...Orpheus? The world of INKHEART is a wonderful one --- there are fairies and glassmen and shapeshifters and giants. It is also a harsh world with many deaths. This is not a book for the squeamish, Funke doesn't hold back with these. The characters are complex. Things change for all of them. Some of them seem to be headed to the dark side at times. As for plot, Funke kept me on my toes all the time wondering what would happen next. Up to the very last page, I was totally unsure. (I should say it ends satisfyingly, but won't say more than that. Or at least, I was satisfied.) The book is dense with plot, characters, world, and ideas. I loved it, but can imagine that it takes a particular reader to most enjoy it. My ARC weighs in at 663 pages (with a relatively small font to boot). So for fans of the previous two books, I think you are in for a exciting, thought-provoking, and satisfying final ride. ...more Wow. Wow! I'm speechless. Wow. Gah, I don't know what to say.

I could not tear my eyes away from the pages when I was reading it, and the whole time, my heart was pounding so hard ... Inkdeath is crazily exciting and thrilling. And there are so many genius plot twists, it's incredible! It's so different than the two other books in the trilogy, and that's one of the reasons why this is my favorite of all three. There is so much amazing character development. Cornelia Funke has always been a queen of characters, but in Inkdeath, she definitely branches out and develops her well-loved characters to an astounding extent. In Inkheart and Inkspell, Resa was a bit flat; the kind, caring, sweet mother that looked out for her husband and daughter. But Funke really gives her a lot of depth in Inkdeath. She becomes a hero, instead of always being the one who sits out and watches the action unfold. She shows us all these sides that we never could have guessed of: her fiercely independent side, her firm stubbornness (now we know where Meggie got it from), her internal struggles \u2013 even all her flaws. I love how she has the courage and independence to go against her husband and wife and try to find a way for them to go back home. I really enjoyed getting to know Resa better, and watching her turn from a flat character to the three dimensional one she is now. Mo's transformation into the Bluejay is amazing. He reveals a whole different side of him that I never knew he had. Who would have guessed that the quiet, loving bookbinder could also be the brave, noble, cold-blooded Bluejay? It's amazing how much Mo changes from Inkspell to Inkdeath ... in Inkspell, he kept telling everyone he wasn't the Bluejay, and he kept refusing the part. But in Inkdeath, he becomes the Bluejay, and he embraces the character as himself. Already in the first chapters, he is going out at night and killing, and he even considers himself to be the Bluejay. In Inkspell, I never would have guessed that Mo was actually going to turn into the Bluejay! Or was the Bluejay always a part of him, and he was just letting it free? What came first: Mo or the Bluejay? Who knows. Either way, it's so cool how much Mo changes. It's funny how at the beginning of Inkdeath, I want Mo to stop being the Bluejay, but when he finally stops at the end, I'm sad. Dustfinger changes a lot when he comes back from the dead, and in my opinion, it's for the better. Yes, he has always been a very round, three-dimensional character, but I've always hated him. He was selfish, he only did things for himself, he only helped others if he could get something out of it, and he was always only concerned about his own agenda. Plus, I'd never really forgiven him for betraying Mo and Meggie at the beginning of Inkheart and leading Capricorn to them. And I hated him for always leaving Roxane and Brianna and going off doing whatever. When Dustfinger comes back to life in Inkdeath, I change from hating him to loving him. He isn't selfish anymore, and he doesn't hate Mo so unfairly. In fact, he and Mo are very close, so close that they can feel the other's emotions, which I think is really cool. I love how he always follows Mo and protects him. And the new things he can do with fire are awesome. Dustfinger definitely changes for the better. Farid, on the other hand, changes for the worse. In Inkspell, he was the sweet, caring, kind boy who was head over heels in love with Meggie. In Inkdeath, he is a total selfish jerk. He only cares about rescuing Dustfinger \u2013 he's way too obsessed with that, actually. He barely cares about Meggie anymore, even though he used to be in love with her, and he actually cheats on her countless times with a bunch of maids. That moron has no sense of faith! By the middle of Inkdeath, I'm ready to jump into the book and punch him. I'm so glad that Meggie chooses Doria over Farid. I would have probably killed her if she chose Farid. Doria is so much nicer, and Farid doesn't deserve Meggie. It makes me kind of sad, though, when I remember how sweet Farid and Meggie were together in Inkspell. It makes me frustrated; wasn't Farid the one who was in love with Meggie!?! Ah well. Violante really grows and develops in Inkdeath. In Inkspell, she was pretty flat; we didn't know much about her personality, and she didn't have that big of a role. But in Inkdeath, she has a huge part, and I like that. She shows herself to be strong and independent and clever. She's a great character. It's interesting how she's in love with the Bluejay, but hopefully she'll get over it now, because what Fenoglio said is true: she's not actually in love with Mo himself, but the part that he played. Okay, let's talk about Meggie. She has no part at all in Inkdeath \u2013 and I love that. Okay, maybe Meggie's nice, but let's face it; she's always been a pretty boring, flat main character. So it's quite a relief to have other, more interesting characters be the main characters of Inkdeath \u2013 their views are much more exciting than Meggie's, and I love taking a look through all their eyes. Also, I was quite tired of Meggie always being the one to save the day. So I'm really glad that different people saved the day this time \u2013 that Mo and Resa and Dustfinger got their chance. I'm glad that she isn't the center of attention this time, and that I get to understand other characters better. The scene where Mo talks to Death is so cool. Funke portrays Death in such a creative way; I never would have imagined Death as a shape-shifter, or with a woman's voice. That's one of my favorite scenes in the book. I love the Black Prince, but I'm disappointed that he doesn't do much in this book. He basically stays behind while Mo does everything. Ah well. I love how the climax of the book is set in the Castle in the Lake. That castle is really cool, and it lets us see Violante's history. We find out a lot about her mother, which we didn't know much about before (and who would have guessed that Violante's mother was actually in love with the Adder? I still don't see how she could have fallen in love with that snake ...). Plus, it's nice that the action is happening at a different place than the Ombra Castle or the Castle of Night. I hate Orpheus SO much. Every single time I see him in the book, I want to leap into the pages and beat that son of a female dog to a pulp. Many times I wanted to chuck the book at the wall and stop reading because of him. I hate his stupid, sadistic, conceited, selfish, greedy butt SO much. I would have HAPPILY killed him. Slooowwwllyyy. And I would have enjoyed every second of it. (No, I am not a sadist. Shut up. Only Orpheus makes me like this. :P) Most of the bad things that happen in Inkdeath are because of him. And it was so disgusting, the way he was using the maids. Pedophile! Through the whole book, I was waiting and waiting for Mo or at least someone to kill him, but nooooo ! Instead he gets to run off skipping into the sunset, unharmed! (Well, it's not really the sunset \u2013 more like the cold mountains. And I doubt he's skipping. But still. AGH!) Darnit, Cornelia, why couldn't you have just killed him! C'mon, it wouldn't have taken more than a few minutes! I mean, you've already killed so many people in Inkdeath, what's one more to you? I hope he freezes to death in the mountains. No, that's too nice of a death for him. I hope he reaches another village, tries to trick them and get wealthy, but they burn him at the stake. And he has a long, painful death in which he realizes that he is actually a terrible and pathetic person, and that Mo is so much better than him. YES!! THAT WOULD BE PERFECT!! :D GO DIE, ORPHEUS!!! YOU SUCK AT WRITING AND AT READING!! HAA!! TAKE THAT , YOU STUPID DOG!! YOU CAN'T WRITE, YOU CAN ONLY STEAL THE WORDS OF A WRITER THAT'S BETTER THAN YOU!! HAVE WE EVER SEEN YOU WRITE WITHOUT USING FENOGLIO'S WORDS?? HUH?? HUH?? NO, DIDN'T THINK SO. HAA!! SO GO DIE !!!! Okay, I think I'm done now. Yay. That felt good. I don't like Fenoglio much, either. Okay, yeah, he's nicer than Orpheus (EVERYONE is), but that's not saying much at all. He's almost as vain and arrogant as Orpheus, and he always really irritates me. It really bugs me how he barely writes a word in all of Inkdeath for Meggie to read to make things turn for the better. The whole time where he's just drinking and feeling sorry for himself, I want to slap him, and even when he stops drinking, he doesn't even write at all. It makes me want to scream at him, \u201cWHO'S STORY IS THIS, YOU CRAZY OLD MAN? YOURS! IT'S YOUR STORY, ISN'T IT? SO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!\u201d But nooo. He's a totally useless character in this book. The thing about how Fenoglio wrote a different story about the grown-up Doria is so amazing! I think it's really interesting that Doria's story isn't published, but it still is included in the Inkworld. Which shows that a story doesn't have to be published to come to life, and I love that message. :) I was always sad how Dustfinger loved Brianna, but she hated him. It hurt whenever Brianna referred to Dustfinger as \u201cThe Fire-Dancer,\u201d instead of her father, and when Brianna never seemed to care that her father was dead. But at the end of Inkdeath, she starts to accept him as her father, when he saves her from the Night-Mare, and I really like that. Also, Violante and Jacopo have always hated each other, but at the end of Inkdeath they start to warm up to each other. I love the hints that Funke gives us \u2013 how Jacopo calls Violante \u201cmother\u201d for the first time, and how Violante puts her arm around her son. There are so many astonishing plot twists that sweep me off my feet (in a good way) in this book ... Violante offering Mo her alliance; Violante being in love with the Bluejay; Mo visiting Death and making a bargain with her (I never would have expected Death to actually be personified and revealed as a character in this story, so I didn't know what to think when Mo went into the world of the dead \u2013 and I was stunned right out of my skin when Mo met Death); Dustfinger coming back to life (I was convinced that he was going to stay dead, forever, so it's a huge surprise when Mo brings him back into the world with him); the whole thing with Meggie falling out of love with Farid and in love with Doria; Mortola coming back and allying herself with Orpheus; her turning into a magpie; Resa turning into a swift; Basta's spirit being the Night-Mare (I thought Night-Mares were just nameless creatures, so it came as quite a shock. I'm so glad that Dustfinger kills it; I've always thought that Dustfinger should have been the one to kill Basta, not Mo.) ... But the biggest and most shocking plot twist of them all is definitely Jacopo's part in the conclusion of Inkdeath. Jacopo is the last person I would have expected to help Mo kill the Adderhead \u2013 which is why I love the fact that he does. I love when minor characters turn into major characters. And it makes perfect sense why he does it ... at the end of the book, we can see that Jacopo is changing. He's still snobby and bratty and self-centered, but he doesn't idolize his grandfather or the Piper anymore, and he begins to hate them. And, he starts to feel affection towards his mother. That's why he changes heart and helps Mo. This makes me really respect and view him differently; I used to hate him, but after what he does, I almost feel affection towards him. I think it's really cool how Mo writes the three words in the book, how Jacopo distracts the Piper. It's so suspenseful and intense when Mo writes each word, then gets distracted after each. That's my favorite part in the book (besides the scene where Mo meets with Death); my heart was beating so fast at those moments! It's so dramatic. And I love how the words to kill the Adderhead are the three titles of the book, in order: heart, spell, and death. It ties the book titles' together and makes sense why the books are called what they are. However, I just recently found out that when Cornelia originally wrote the book in German, she called the second book \u201cInkblood\u201d instead of \u201cInkspell.\u201d So in that case, did the translator not only change the title from \u201cblood\u201d to \u201cspell,\u201d but also the words that the kill the Adder from \u201cheart, BLOOD, and death\u201d to \u201cheart, spell, and death?\u201d It makes more sense that way ... but why did they change it? What's up with the White Woman that writes something about Mo and gives it to Meggie? We never actually find out what is written on there, Meggie only says that it's \u201cthe Bluejay's last song\u201d and that it's a happy ending for him or something. I don't get it. Did the White Woman write something for Meggie to read, so that Mo's story would end happily \u2013 so does that mean that the good outcome of the events at the Castle in the Lake are because of Meggie? But we never actually saw Meggie read, and she never said so ... so did the White Woman just show Meggie what was going to happen, so she wouldn't worry? But why would the White Woman do that \u2013 wouldn't she just let Meggie find out when Mo came home safe? Plus, why did the White Woman care so much about Mo? The last line of the chapter before the epilogue is awesome. But even though Farid is a jerk and totally deserves Meggie to leave him, it still makes me kind of sad ... because I remember the days in Inkspell when Farid and Meggie were together, and that was so sweet ... *sigh* oh well. I love the epilogue. Meggie's brother seems so cute. It's so cool how he longs to go to the real world, just like Meggie once longed to go to the Inkworld. The last line of the book is so cool; it kind of makes you feel like the story is going back to the beginning again, except reversed. I love indefinite endings. :D I'm kind of disappointed that the Folcharts don't go back to the real world (Doria with them, of course), but I guess they really do love the Inkworld ... and I admit, I fell in love with the Inkworld myself, too. So I can hardly complain. :D No, I'm actually happy that they stay. One thing I really love about this trilogy is how Cornelia Funke puts quotes from other books at the beginning of each chapter, quotes that sort of have to do with what goes on in each chapter. They're interesting, and I always get a pleasant jolt when she puts a quote from a book that I've read. :D Cornelia Funke's characters really impress me. Her ability to create such realistic and believable characters is astounding. Every single one of her characters are so round and complex and three-dimensional, and they're all so lifelike! It's not just that ... they all mature and develop and grow so much over the three books. Only a highly skilled writer can do that. What really amazes me is that Cornelia Funke wrote the book in German, so the English edition is written by a translator \u2013 and it has such an amazing writing style! The books are one of the most well-written ones I've ever read. But usually when a book gets translated, the writing style isn't that great, because the pretty prose usually gets lost when someone else takes them and transfers them to a different language. Not in this case! Either Cornelia Funke is such a great writer that her style shines even through the tampering of translation, or the translator is a great writer herself! It's probably a mixture of both. Another thing is, I feel like the book drags on for way too long. There are long periods of time in which nothing seems to happen, or the events just get stretched out and out. Sometimes I felt like the book was never going to end. The book doesn't flow well. When I try to remember the first half of the book, it feels hazy, and it feels like I'm remembering it from a book before Inkdeath. Funke should have cut Inkdeath in half and made it into two separate books, in my opinion. That would have made it much easier. Or at least, she should have made it much shorter! There are many unnecessary scenes, and the ones that are necessary go on for forever. I didn't like how Meggie's ambition to be a writer just kind of dropped after the first book. What happened to her wanting to be like Fenoglio and write her own words that she can read aloud? In Inkdeath, she doesn't even think of that ambition again! It's like someone totally erased it in her mind, or Funke didn't think it was important anymore ...which really frustrates me. I thought it was really cool that Meggie wanted to be a writer, so why did that have to spill out the window?!? Also, I think the whole Brianna/Cosimo thing is weird. First of all, I thought it was kind of gross when they were in love in Inkspell, because he's like, way older than her (it never actually says how old Cosimo is, but I've always thought of him as being, like, 20, while Brianna is 15. Pedophile, anyone?) plus he was MARRIED to Violante, so he was cheating on his wife with her own maid! Plus, what I really didn't get was that Violante knew about it, and she wasn't doing anything . What the hell?!? (I mean, Brianna was spending her nights with Cosimo, for crying out loud! What does that tell you?) So I don't get at all why Violante forgives Brianna for cheating on her with her husband and why she lets Brianna come back to her. I would have punched her for even asking to come back! Ugh. Sometimes I feel like there's too much going on in the story. There are too many subplots (so many that sometimes I forget what the main plot is), too many back stories, and definitely too many villains. There's way too many conflicts to keep track of them all, and with all these different villains with all their different agents, and all these different heroes with all their different agendas, I found myself getting many headaches as I was struggling to keep up with the crazy tangle going on in Inkdeath. And not all the villains are even that great, either. I mean, the Piper and Orpheus and Mortola are great villains, but the Milksop is a boring, flat one ... and the Adderhead is such a lame villain in Inkdeath. Sure, in Inkspell he was a great villain, but he loses all his magic in Inkdeath, and just turns into an annoying old man. I kind of feel the same about Mortola \u2013 she was a great villain before, but in Inkdeath she just becomes really annoying, and there isn't really any point to her in this book. She doesn't do much, and she just ends up dying anyway before she can cause any harm or anything. Okay, enough of the things I didn't like about it... I really love the theme of Inkdeath: the message that it is not the author who controls the story, but the characters and the story itself. This is basically the theme of the whole trilogy. The story and characters will do what they want, whether the author likes it or not, and it is in fact the story and characters that control the author, not the other way around. This is so true; every writer learns that the hard way (I'm talking from experience. Erp. ><) I think this is the coolest theme a book has ever portrayed. All in all, this is an amazing ending to the trilogy, and I'm glad that Cornelia Funke finished it this way; it's perfect. I love this series so much, and it's now one of my top favorites. It's a great story not only for book lovers, but for writers, too. I'm definitely going to keep these three books and take them with me wherever I go. I'll definitely go on re-reading and re-reading them, and I know this is one of those series's that I'll be reading even when I'm an adult. ...more \u062e\u0648 \u0645\u064f\u0648 \u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0631\u0650 \u0686\u0648\u0637\u0648\u0631 \u0631\u0650\u06cc\u062a \u0628\u064f\u062f\u064f\u0645\u061f!

And yes I know that I am sounded totally stupid just saying this. I gave the book a one star cause I just couldn't think of giving it a little higher. I just felt like putting the one star just to say that it wasn't really my favorite. I think Inkheart and Inspell were more like involved in the story than Inkdeath. Inkdeath had this mystery into it. It just sounded different. Oh and excuse me for not liking the book. =P Everyone has it's own opinions. Doria. I didn't like his character. Perioid, and it wasn't really just because of Farid. I would have been happy just fine if Meggie left Farid but I just wanted a happy ending for Farid because I felt like he deserved one. In all... I just want to say that either way I still think that the book should be re-written or something. I don't know anymore. I really loved this series but the last book just wasn't good enough for me. ...more I absolutely LOVED this one! This was everything I hoped it would be and more. I thought the author did a great job of bringing this altogether and \"ending\" it. Don't want to say too much as my friends haven't read it yet but there were some surprises and the story was left \"sort of\"open-- new series in the making? :) This third installment was a bit darker than the last 2-- much more like the ending of InkSpell.

For a while everything gets to a point where it all feels so hopeless. But the way the story is told, the events, the twisting and turning of the story-- just makes you almost HAVE to keep reading! I admit to be a little confused at the beginning-- the number of characters and the switching of view points every few pages seemed a little overwhelming at first but that soon goes away and you just get absorbed. I really enjoyed Doria's character and the little glass men, Rosenquartz and Jasper. I also liked the much better development of Resa's character. I hope anyone who reads this enjoys it as much as I did!

me completely content - no loose ends and remarkably realistic for a fantasy. Inkdeath is certainly something to look forward too. wow. I always expect to be disappointed with the final novel in a series...

I think Meggie's, \"pushing away\" of Farid, kind of filled that hole for me. Now, lets talk about Dustfinger... O.O I fell in love with this character through this book. I felt myself start to fall during INKSPELL, but I was 100% head over heels by the end of INDEATH. I lived to read the burning passages about the Fire-Dancer. He is one of the most beautiful and compelling characters I've ever read. If Funke made any great achievements with this series, it was in the character of Dustfinger. He leaps off of the page and pulls you into the Inkworld. To be fair, I feel I must touch on a few other characters before wrapping up my review. Elinor - became INCREASINGLY annoying through the series. In Inkheart she was humorous, and almost charming. But I could have reached through the book and throttled her in Inkdeath! Resa - also became quite annoying throughout Inkdeath. I could almost say that I dislike her character after reading the third book. Mo - Mo's transformation into the Bluejay was superb! The most beautiful scene in the whole novel was when he rode to the castle gates (escorted magnificently be Dustfinger of course), and turned himself in to save the children of Ombra. Meggie - My attachments to Meggie never really faltered throughout the series. As a character, she had really good instincts, and would always come through when the plot became unbearably frustrating... (in the sense that the \"bad guys\" were to far ahead) :) Orpheus - I wanted Orpheus to suffer a very painful, and humiliating death, in which he realized that Mo really was greater than him, but Funke did not give me such satisfaction. It's okay though. I like to think that he did INDEED freeze to death in the mountains. Or better yet, that he became the tortured plaything of a giant. :) ...more Eh, not my favorite of the series, but the writing was good. Honestly I'd hoped for better.

Ok, when it comes to Meggie's boy choices, I really like Doria. While Farid is awesome, Doria is effing amazing. Farid spent more time pining after Dustfinger than he did after Meggie, which says something about how he is. He also played the jealous boyfriend, more possessive than loving. Doria, on the other hand, is nice and actually cares about Meggie's feelings. He may seem like he's trying to steal Meggie away from Farid, but that's because he is trying to steal Meggie away from Farid. Oh, and I was right about the baby. It was a boy. It was pretty obvious in the way that everyone wanted a girl. They didn't need another girl in that family anyway. No, what I really didn't like about the book is the way it jumped around. Dustfinger is alive, now he's \"dead\", now he's alive again. Then there was the whole transforming into animals thing. What was that about? The ending was really rushed, and I kind of wish that the author had slowed down to explain some things and left out all of the unnecessary details that amounted to nothing in the end anyway. Mo...don't even get me started on Mo. I know she was trying to incorporate the whole \"Bluejay taking over\" thing, but it just made him into a selfish jerk. Anyway, just wishing it was better. Right now, I like it mostly because it ended the series. ...more I love it when people write reviews that are EX.AC.TLY. on par with how I felt about a book. This one in particular gets it spot on. I was really disappointed by Inkdeath. Not gonna lie. I finished it several days ago and have sat around trying to think of positive things to say about it but I got nothin'. This is by far the weakest book in the trilogy and should have been much shorter and much less lame. Dangit.

This one in particular gets it spot on. I was really disappointed by Inkdeath. Not gonna lie.

This is by far the weakest book in the trilogy and should have been much shorter and much less lame. Dangit. This book is not quite a total departure from Inkheart and Inkspell but it's pretty close. None of the characters feel fleshed out in Inkdeath. Farid in particular - he never gets over his weird obsession with Dustfinger. Now, having weird obsessions with father figures of my own, I feel pretty confident in saying that Farid needs to seek some serious mental help. That whole part of the story just didn't ring true to me, honestly. I get being concerned for Dustfinger, but not obsessed to the point of stalkerishness with him. Creepy. Meggie finds a new, completely random and weird, love interest. It actually ties into the story decently with Fenoglio remembering that he'd written a short story about that particular character but it was never published. But it's still random and weird. And the love interest character never feels like a part of the integral cast. Mo's character was probably the least disappointing here. He went through a pretty awesomely harrowing torture sequence with Orpheus near the end. But even then, the ending felt odd and kind of disjointed. And totally not what I expected. So, I'm glad I read Inkdeath because yay closure! But at the same time, I think I would have preferred a different ending like the one that was good in my head. I also would have liked to know the baby's name, just because I'm curious like that. ...more The word for this book--one that occurs more than any other besides names and \"fire\"--would be \"longing.\" There's the longing of the vaporous White Women, clutching at hearts and pulling them toward eternal peace. There's the longing of every character, separated from loved ones as all battle to overcome the spreading evil. There's the longing to become more powerful, especially evident in Orpheus, but also clear in the others, to be more: more alive, more noticed, more feared, or more important. Ov The word for this book--one that occurs more than any other besides names and \"fire\"--would be \"longing.\" There's the longing of the vaporous White Women, clutching at hearts and pulling them toward eternal peace. There's the longing of every character, separated from loved ones as all battle to overcome the spreading evil. There's the longing to become more powerful, especially evident in Orpheus, but also clear in the others, to be more: more alive, more noticed, more feared, or more important. Over and through all these is the single longing to be home, not that many seemed to know in which world that was. From Elinor to Resa to Meggie to Fenoglio to Dustfinger. They longed to be away from the death and destruction, but they knew it wouldn't disappear just because they did. They longed to be with loved ones in a safe place, or just nearer loved ones if possible. Each of these \"longings\" created many problems in Inkdeath, the central plots, hinging on what each character wanted, and what the story brought about. There were so many intricately woven fabrics and plot threads that it was fascinating to watch, and astounding to see come to the end, looking all neat, though the middle was a tangle. Jacapo surprised me, for one. I always like to make up ways for the characters to win, but this story has a mind of its own, and I can see that my ideas, just like more of the characters' ideas, would have gone awry just because the Inkworld wouldn't like it. I've heard of characters acting on their own volition, without an author's apparent permission, but never of a world that took on its own personality. ...more I read Inkdeath as a buddy read with a friend. This one wraps up the Inkheart trilogy. I am so glad I started and got to finish this trilogy. I must say that I would not class this as a middle grade series.

Even though this one felt like it had so much more depth it was still easier to follow and it was also very engaging. Once again I loved the characters and how well they developed over the three books. I did not find that I enjoyed Mo as much in this one for reasons that I will not include here. Readers should be able to experience all of that themselves. I think this series is a great one for some unexpected surprises. I recommend this to anyone who loves fantasy, or maybe some mystery and thriller all rolled into one. Just remember that this is pretty complex story and some content may not be suitable for younger readers. in my opinion. This last book is a great wrap up of the story and totally worth reading all of them. ...more I'd been anticipating this book for a long, long time, so my expectations were high. Also it had been a while since I'd re-read Inkheart or Inkspell , so some things were hard for me to remember. The writing was as beautiful as the first two books, and several chapters (especially #8) were very moving and eloquent. In that, it didn't disappoint me at all.

My main complaint is that Dustfinger almost completely lost his charm. Before, he had been pretty much one of my favorite literary characters EVER, and even though I was glad he was risen from the dead I didn't like how he \"became Mo's shadow\" or whatever; it completely took away from his enigmatic-ness and his general character, really. Farid was basically shoved to the side in this book, which I didn't mind since I'd never liked him much anyway (yes, I know I'm the only one!), but it seemed a little abrupt how Doria just ran in and Meggie fell for him and that was that. The middle of the book was really good and I was quite enthralled, but towards the end it seemed like Cornelia was rushing the story. The Adderhead died so quickly and then Mo and Resa and Dustfinger and Brianna all went back to the giant tree, which took about one page. Since it's the end of the series I had hoped for more. I liked how everyone stayed in the Inkworld...I'd sort of been expecting them to feel like they had to go home when it was all over, so that was nicely different. All together, Inkdeath was very good but it didn't quite measure up to the other two. ...more It has been a real pain to get to finish this book. The idea has always been original, but the writer doesn't know how to develop the story in an interesting way. Let's just say that the book only starts to get interesting in the last 100 pages or so, and it's 700 pages long! The characters are in a fantasy world that is barely explored. Nothing happens for a long time and, when something does happen, it's just too sudden, out of nowhere, and it finished quickly.

Nothing happens for a long time and, when something does happen, it's just too sudden, out of nowhere, and it finished quickly. Characters that could add some drama also appear out of nowhere after no mention since the very beginning only to die shortly after. So what's the point? Characters die, resurrect, die again, suddenly some can get out of their body to avoid really dying... some tricks up the sleeve based on nothing, really. Regarding time, there is no good references to guide you. Sometimes you feel a year has gone by only to discover it's been only a month. Sometimes characters remember something, some place that they cannot have been before (when did they have the time to do that if the action has been there all the time?) And the worst has been the constant reminiscing of the characters... all the time, even if they are in the most dangerous situations, they still have time to remember (for a few pages, mind you!) those sweet times when they did this and that. So I'm glad I've finally finished it. It's taken me way too long and I'm happy it was the last one of this trilogy. I don't think I'll read anything else from her. She still needs to polish too many things, like not knowing how to cope with a long story. ...more (spoilers) I learned that the first book of this trilogy is unfortunately the best book in this trilogy. While the ending is good there are major flaws in the text: 1. Aunt Elinor was a vital character in book 1 and to see her cast aside as minor for books 2 and 3 was very disappointing. 2.

Nothing about the Inkworld made me want to stay there but all of them thought it cushy enough to live there forever? Maybe they had troubles getting home, i dunno but I personally would have tried harder to do so. 6. And the moral of the story is that life always seems better in books than rather the one we live on a daily basis... but sometimes you go to the world and realize its extremely violent and that Brendan Fraiser is your dad and you wonder what the heck you got yourself into in the first place. ...more I wavered between 3 and 4 stars for this one. \"Inkheart,\" the first of the trilogy, is definitely my favorite of the three, and I really loved it.

The family story taking place in what might be called \"complimentary worlds\", with a cast of characters from each. I enjoyed these books and providing that the \"youth\" is mature enough for the story, I think most will, young or old. I have come back and added an \"edit\" moving it up to 5 stars.

Akhirnya, setelah dua kali sebelumnya nyoba baca dan mandeg di tengah tengah, kali ini saya berhasil baca sampe tamat. endingnya, bener bener bikin senewen. setelah perburuan menegangkan, eh lha kok enteng amat ternyata penyelesaiannya. i was like... hah, gini doank?? tapi ya lumayanlah. setidaknya satu buku bantal berkurang dari timbunan. yihaaaa Unsurprisingly, given the title, Inkdeath is very, very preoccupied with death. The death of loved ones, the fear of death, cheating death, what happens after death... Reading it is almost like reading about the process of writing, as more and more detail is put into the world -- albeit from the inside.

I do feel like all these books got rather needlessly complicated, that at some point it just went too far. I love the ideas and appreciate some of the things that happen and the way the characters are revealed by it, but for a slick, absorbing story, we could've done with a few less threads. It feels a little... cluttered, at times. There's so many villains, all at cross-purposes; so many heroes who keep getting parted and then reunited by a twist in the tale... and so on and so forth. The characters get developed a lot more in this book. The fact that the book is third-person-not-very-limited, as I sometimes call it, kind of doesn't help. We see through so many different eyes that that doesn't help with the feeling of it being a little too cluttered. There's Farid, Meggie, Mo, Resa, Dustfinger, Orpheus, Elinor, Fenoglio... Sometimes it feels rather more like being told than being shown, because the narrative does get right up close to the characters. I do like the characters and think they have some quite interesting quirks and storylines, though. Mortimer's interested me quite a lot: the whole dilemma about is he becoming the Bluejay because of what Fenoglio wrote, or is the Bluejay simply becoming more and more associated with Mortimer because the original character was based on him? The whole plotline about the White Women was interesting, too, their involvement with both Dustfinger and Mortimer. I didn't feel Resa or Roxane much as characters, but I did feel for Mortimer and Dustfinger being separated from them. I loved the part about Mortimer and Dustfinger becoming bound together. They already were, in some ways, but their relationship was so horribly complex. In a way, the fact that they can see eye to eye thanks to what happens in this book is a lovely thing. Fenoglio's character began to annoy me quite a lot, in this book. He was already getting there in the last book, but he seemed to me everything that I can hate about authors: all pompous about his own work, obsessed with the idea of writer's block and blaming it on everyone else, and unwilling to admit that once a story is written it's out of your hands. He was quite a realistic character, but still an annoying one. As for the ending, I was quite happy with it. I thought it quite realistic that Meggie ended up not being with Farid after all -- that was unexpected, actually. The happily ever after was nice, though, and the sense of the story continuing on beyond what's written on the page. Yay! ...more Warning: MAJOR spoilers. I'm really disappionted. First of all, it took way too long to get into this book. During the first 200-300 pages, I was like \"What?\" I didn't really care about the characters, and nothing they did piqued my interest. It was bland. Maybe bad editing, or maybe bad writing, I couldn't really tell. But I think someone could have safetly cut a LOT of pages from the manuscript without losing that much. I mean, the first books weren't small, but I felt like a lot happened. But Warning: MAJOR spoilers. I'm really disappionted. First of all, it took way too long to get into this book.

I was reduced to skimming the last hundred or so pages, because I just couldn't take it anymore. It's a shame, since I absolutely loved the first two books, and was looking forward to this one, and the upcoming movie. And the end. God, what was that? Meggie falls in love with this random guy (was he in the first two books? I can't remember, but I don't think so.) JUST because Fenoglio wrote something like that? So Meggie is now at the mercy of the writing? When did that happen? Poor Farid. Meggie just completely leaves him in the dust. I felt so bad for him, and I wanted to shake some sense into Meggie. She came across as a whinny child throughout the whole novel, and it came to the point where I really didn't want her to talk. And they stay in the Inkworld? Why? WHY? And the baby in the beginning, and the little cameo he gets at the end? What was the point of that? Oh, and don't get me started with Mo. He bugged the crap out of me. Really, Mo? Risk your life and stay in la-la land just because you want to? Resa bothered me too, but I couldn't pin point why. I just found her annoying and irritating. I'm just sad. This series had so much potential, and the first two were so good. Ugh. I'm so disappointed with the end of this series. ...more I kdy\u017e s\u00e1m takov\u00fdm konc\u016fm nefand\u00edm, ale v p\u0159\u00edpad\u011b Inkoustov\u00e9 smrti si mysl\u00edm, \u017ee si takov\u00fd z\u00e1v\u011br cel\u00e1 s\u00e9rie prost\u011b zaslou\u017eila.

Ka\u017ed\u00e1 z postav se za ty t\u0159i knihy zm\u011bnily, vyrostly a staly se v\u00edce re\u00e1ln\u011bj\u0161\u00edmi. \u010casto jsem si p\u0159ipadal, jako kdyby m\u011b p\u0159\u00edb\u011bh oslovil v\u00edce, ne\u017e jsem cht\u011bl a ka\u017ed\u00e9 z dobrodru\u017estv\u00ed pro\u017e\u00edval s hlavn\u00edmi hrdiny. Cestoval jsem s \u010cern\u00fdm princem a jeho medv\u011bdem; potkal v\u00edly a oh\u0148ov\u00e9 elfy; proch\u00e1zel se chodbami ombersk\u00e9ho hradu; poznal temnou str\u00e1nku poh\u00e1dkov\u00e9ho sv\u011bta... Posledn\u00edch 200 stran bylo pln\u00fdch akce, zvrat\u016f, ne\u010dekan\u00fdch zm\u011b\u0148 postav, nad kter\u00fdmi mohl rozum st\u00e1t, ale v \u017e\u00e1dn\u00e9m p\u0159\u00edpad\u011b mi ani jedna zm\u011bna nep\u0159i\u0161la zvl\u00e1\u0161tn\u00ed. V\u0161echno to do sebe pasovalo jako kostky od Lega. K tomu v\u0161emu si v\u0161echny t\u0159i knihy celou dobu dr\u017e\u00ed n\u011bjakou \u00farove\u0148 a t\u00edm p\u00e1dem nehroz\u00ed, \u017ee pokud jste si Inkoustov\u00fd sv\u011bt obl\u00edbili, rozhodn\u011b v\u00e1s u\u017e nikdy nezklame. S touhle s\u00e9ri\u00ed jsem opravdu spokojen\u00fd a jsem r\u00e1d, \u017ee jsem ji do\u010detl. Pokud budete m\u00edt chu\u0165 na n\u011bjakou \"poh\u00e1dku\" plnou fantazie a knih, Inkoustov\u00fd sv\u011bt bude tou pravou volbou! ;) ...more maybe 3.5, I'm still deciding As a story on it's own, I enjoyed it quite a bit. There is a lot of action and suspense, and I really wasn't sure how it would all come together in the end. However, for characters that I have come to love, I felt a bit torn. I really loved the character of Mo in the first book. He's a fabulous father and he became one of my favorite characters. I love imagining him reading words to life. He is very different in this book. I wanted to hate him because of it, but I fou maybe 3.5, I'm still deciding As a story on it's own, I enjoyed it quite a bit.

He is very different in this book. I wanted to hate him because of it, but I found that I could like the Bluejay as well, just not in the same way. The same is true for formerly brave and daring Meggie. In this book she just kind of sits around waiting for someone else to fix it (and pining over two boys). She never takes the initiative to do something on her own. Also, this book is definately more of a young adult book - more so than the previous two - there was a decent amount of swearing (not a ton, but more than I remember in the previous books) and there quite a bit of dark magic and a general darker feel about the book. Not necessarily a complaint, but something that was different this time around. I can finally understand why Inkspell was originally called Inkblood, though it took until almost the last chapter of this book to figure it out. I wonder if the word was changed in the German edition? ...more", "Title": "Inkdeath"},
