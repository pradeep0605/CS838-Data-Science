It also features an onyx wall that changes colors as the sun sets. These things sound simple and straightforward, but the author makes them appear magical, and places us right there in the room; we can touch the glass, see the streaks of color in the onyx. Other reviewers here have related what the story is. I'll just say it offers a compelling depiction of Czechoslovakia prior to and during the early years of Nazism, seen through the prism of a wealthy auto maker, a Jew, and his Christian wife. My only issue was an occasionally rambling plot and some loose ends, but this didn't matter. The wonder of this book is in the writing and its metaphors, restrained and as subtle as the Glassraume, which is, after all, essentially an empty space. I am actually rereading the book for the second time and am even more impressed with Mawer's ability to paint indelible images with words. ...more \"But human beings are not straightforward, Herr Stahl,\" says a character in this book. \"They are very complex.\" (p. 244) Really?

Because the characters in this book are pretty far from complex, so this was a rather ironic moment in my reading. Ah, the holocaust. Where would mediocre writers be without it? In an effort to put an original twist on this rather hackneyed backdrop, Simon Mawer writes a novel where the main character is a house. We learn about the house's original occupants, a Jewish man, his Christian wife, and their children, who are forced to flee Czechslovakia when the Nazis come. After their departure, we follow their lives as refugees as well as the life of the house where multiple occupants come and go until it is eventually declared a historical landmark. Look. I'm just not one of those people who's into home decorating. Unlike many people I know, I aspire to get through my entire life NOT doing construction or redecorating (which is a pretty realistic dream in my case). So pages and pages of loving description of a house, however artfully written, just leave me cold. Especially when each new occupant gives the author a new opportunity to rehash these details. Okay. The wall was onyx. It was shiny and reflective. I got it. I know that other readers appreciated the idea of giving the house a personality, but this really didn't do it for me. Houses don't talk, and they don't feel, and they don't have relationships, no matter how much Simon Mawer may want to imagine otherwise. So why would I want to read endlessly about a freakin' house? My other main complaint about this book was that the characters seemed ruled by their gonads. Every relationship was sexual. As another goodreads reviewer put it, an architect couldn't just be an architect; a best friend couldn't just be a best friend; feelings of disgust by the wife for the husband's mistress were oddly mingled with a tinge of...you guessed it, sexual attraction. The people weren't interesting, their relationships weren't interesting, but somehow everyone was attracted to everyone else. Booker nominees and winners just keep getting more and more disappointing. ...more This book is definitely a must for anyone who loves to read.

The Villa serves as the main character in the novel as well as serving as the architecture of the book. All of the well drawn characters interact with and within the house and all of the plot revelations take place within its walls. Abandoned by its owners, who fled to Switzerland and then to the U.S. as the threat of World War II approached, the villa is taken over by the Nazis and then by the communist government. It is eventually turned into a museum and becomes the setting for redemption and hope for the characters who survive the war. The house is envisioned as: \u201cSpace, light, glass; some spare furniture; windows looking out on a garden; a sweep of shining floor; white and ivory and the gleam of chrome.\u201d It is intended to symbolize rationality, science, and the spirit of a new post WW I world where reason and democracy would prevail, whether one was German, or Jew, or Czech. But the dream is shattered just as the glass shattered as the Soviets approached to \"liberate\" Czechoslovakia. This book is about many things. It is a book about a culture that slips from decadence into decline, about the winds of war, about anti-Semitism. But it is also about marriage, love, art, architecture, betrayal and loneliness. Most of all, the book itself is a work of art. How can one not marvel at the following description: \"It had become a palace of light, light bouncing off the chrome pillars, light refulgent on the walls ... It was as though they stood inside a crystal of salt.\" Read it!

I found the writing, for the most part, quite sublime in the sense that it suited, perfectly, the story it was used to describe and illuminates the almost ethereal characters at the story\u2019s centre. It has been criticized elsewhere, unjustly in my eyes, for using coincidence to further its narrative ends: of course, there is no such thing as coincidence in real life, is there?

And then they had sex on the linoleum . Or something like that. What we have is a book which focuses on a fictional version of Villa Turgendhat and mentions over and over that it has a glass room with an Onyx wall. Apparently the light and space can be used to symbolise anything you want and loads of people have sex in it. With the subtlety of a brick, this symbolism or reference to the title of the novel is hammered into your brain time and time again. Seemingly all Mawer has done is lifted the history of the building and then slightly modified the lives of the owners, throwing in some fictional supporting characters and adding a tawdry bit of sex every few pages to fill the book out. Every woman had lesbian tendencies during the period covered, don\u2019t you know. And if someone has had an affair, you can bet good money that their lover is going to show up at the house at an awkward moment - but the besmirched party will carry on with a stiff upper lip, mainly because they have dark desires of their own. Of the sapphic kind. Yawn. And don\u2019t worry, just when you are about to chuck the book in the fire, the plot fast-forwards with a whole new set of characters and things repeat themselves all over again. I think he is trying to show how the building is witness to the same follies through various generations, but it was a bit too complex for me to grasp. I got a C in English Literature, you see. Mawer\u2019s attempts to add a bit of historical perspective to proceedings were clumsy too. Oh look, there\u2019s Hitler driving past. Hi Heydrich! I was half expecting a scene where a neighbour mowing their lawn turns out to be Stalin. And then we get onto language. In many places the use of Czech or German are unnecessary. It\u2019s nice that the author wanted to engross themselves in the period so thoroughly, but spare us, please. Curak. As a final insult, after dragging yourself through 404 pages, there is an afterword explaining that the German name of the space is far more poetic and symbolic than the English title of the book. So all that heavy handed bollocks I suffered throughout the story was all lost in translation, obviously. Silly me, I just thought I was reading an awful book. ...more I've given this book three stars, but really it's a combination of two and four.

(The eugenics \"research\" going on in it during one interlude is quite chilling.) It's so lovingly described that it becomes tangible, and its peculiarly stubborn form of modernity both anchors it in and sets it off from its ever-changing environment. Very interesting how the Nazis--so \"new order\" themselves--categorically reject its conception of the future.

Granted, she likely had no idea what was actually going on. Nonetheless, it made me care less about the humans in this book than I already did. In addition to the characters being mostly flat, sex (or lack thereof) defines and shapes almost all the relationships. No, you can\u2019t have a male architect who\u2019s just an architect or a female best friend who\u2019s just a friend. There must be a bit of lust going on \u2013 man, woman, old, young. There\u2019s even a scene where the author uses breastfeeding in a sensual manner, which was quite bothersome. That said, the writing is lovely and descriptions of the house beautiful (it\u2019s based on a real place). One of the characters, Hana, is filled with life even though her rampant sexual exploits got a little old after awhile.

Russians turn it into a children's hospital for physiotherapy. And through all this time, the glass house continues to provide us with a microscope into the lives of all who live in or pass through its panes. We're given an insight into a man who is detached from his family but becomes infatuated with a woman he meets by chance, his wife who compartmentalizes her feelings and coordinates a unique living arrangement to keep her family together, a woman who lives as a free-spirit flitting from one lover to another...until one sends her to a concentration camp in Ravensbruck, an actress who seeks to escape from her jealous husband in order to return to the silver screen, and a woman who turns to a different career once her dreams where shattered by a broken ankle.

That Simon Mawer's style mimicked a novel in translation, yet was really tremendously well controlled is just one of the aspects that make this book stand out from other historical novels. For The Glass Room is an historical novel and both the sometimes subtle presence and sometimes ironic impact of historical context is integral to the story. The story starts simply enough, a Czech couple, the Landauers, on their honeymoon journey to Italy, but before they arrive there they visit the grave of the Bride's brother who died in the Great War. In just a few pages we already have some of the themes: history, endings and beginnings, death and life. But this novel is just as much about the new house that is yet to be built on a plot of land that was a present from the bride's parents. It is this house, designed by the great modern architect Rainer von Abt, that will have as its centerpiece the \"Glass Room\" of the title, and at the center of the room an onyx wall that is magnificent in its simplicity. The story spans the rest of the twentieth century and involves living, loving, parting, tragedy, and more than one metamorphosis for the \"Glass Room\" at the heart of the story. In addition to the smooth almost glass-like writing style I was impressed by the structure of the book as the story gathers speed, develops the central characters, provides suspense and deftly links the various subplots. Early in the novel the architect, Rainer von Abt, tells the Landauers that: \"'I am a poet of space and form. Of light' -- it seemed to be no difficulty at all to drag another quality into his aesthetic -- 'of light and space and form. Architects are people who build walls and floors and roofs. I capture and enclose the space within.'\"(p 16) The author is also a poet whose aesthetic provides similar form for this story. Yes, this is the exciting era of modern architecture, of the new era represented by artists like Mondrian and others who were establishing \" de stijl \". The world is constantly changing and the artists, the architects, and musicians like Janacek and Kapralova are leading the way. The political world of the story is in turmoil with changes, including another war and its aftermath, lead the Landauers to new ventures, places, and loves as the plot unfolds. However, the key to the story remains the haunting spirit of the\"Glass Room\". \"She dreams. She dreams of cold. She dreams of glass and light, the Glass Room washed with reflection, and the cool view across the city of rooftops, the cold view through the trees, the crack of snow beneath your boots. She dreams of a place that is without form or substance, that exists only in the manner of dreams, shifting and insubstantial, diffuse, diverse;\" ...more The home commissioned by automobile maker Victor Landauer and his wife Liesel in 1929 has as a focal point The Glass Room.

It sits above a town on a hill in Czechoslovakia, with spectacular views, and it offered \"the most remarkable experience of modern living,\" a theme that runs throughout the novel and throughout time. The story (without going into much plot detail here) follows the lives of the Landauers while they are both in and away from the house, having to leave Czechoslovakia because of the Nazi occupation and Hitler's actions against the Jews. While times change, the house and the Glass Room remain, serving as vehicles through which history plays out through several regimes -- the Nazis, the Soviets, and then through the fall of the Berlin Wall. The writing is excellent -- and although the Landauer's story depends a lot on coincidence (which normally I don't like to see in a novel), here it actually works. Mawer's characterizations are wonderful, and the house itself stands as probably the most important character in the novel. The author also has this incredible sense of place and time that make the story real, believable, and well worth reading. It's definitely a book full of symbolism and observations, but in the interest of not wanting to spoil things for other readers, I'll merely note that there are a myriad of places on the internet where you can read more in depth about this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants an outstanding read, and I must say, this is one of the best of the Booker Prize nominees this year. People who enjoy good historical fiction will definitely want to read this as well. The Glass Room is truly an amazing book. ...more Europe between the wars is heady in its mix of optimism and foreboding, and both impel the reader\u2019s involvement in this story of the unlikely meeting between a Czech Jewish capitalist and his wife in Venice to a brash and forward-looking minimalist Austrian architect.

And this is literally what the architect of the novel intended: that outside is in and inside is out and the space and light he captured are the art he intended to achieve. The novel mirrors the architecture: magnificent and sprawling, yet contained, the expansive room with glass sides reveals all. The motivations of the characters are not hidden; flaws and beauty are apparent. If this book were a piece of music, it might be a piano sonata in several movements, for music rings throughout the house and this book. Special note is made of a young composer, Vitezslava Kapr\u00e1lov\u00e1 , who died at 25 years of age the day France fell to the Germans in the world-encompassing European conflict of the 20th century. But the book is more than the house, or the glass room. It is the intimate history of several intersecting lives of that period, and later, when they meet again. It is compulsive reading, for its revelations were shocking then, and even to us now. The european-ness of the novel is strong, like a flavor, a color, or a sound. We become reacquainted with the Czech word l\u1f77tost , the unbearable sadness of being, and are reminded of the deep and now ghostly scars of war. A bravo performance by Mawer, whose other works I shall follow with avidity. ...more THE GLASS ROOM by Simon Mawrer is the story of a fabulous house built in Czechoslovakia in the late 1920s for a young couple.

But the book is not about the couple who commissioned the house. Rather, it is about the house itself. So after the main characters disappear in the middle of France in around 1942, we are yanked back to the house and introduced to a new cast of characters. To the Germans who used it as a laboratory. To the Soviets who overran it on their way to Berlin. To the people who lived in Communist Czechoslovakia. And finally to the people who wanted to restore it. In many ways, this is a wonderful book. Simon Mawrer is an accomplished writer with an ear for the nuances of many languages, not just English. But the major problem for me happened when he abandoned the original family is France and yanked the reader back to the house. At that point, I started to skim, because it was just too hard for me to connect with a new cast of characters I didn\u2019t know, especially when I was dying to find out what happened to the young family. It seems to me that either Mr. Mawrer should have kept his focus on the family and what happened to them, or made the beginning part of the book much shorter, so that the reader wouldn\u2019t become so invested in what happened to Liesel and Viktor, and therefore not disappointed when the focus of the book suddenly shifted back to the house.

Mawer invites his reader to take part in the planning of the building, its construction and its life thereafter.

Not only does he blend these and other penetrating ideas, he also consistently and utterly engages the reader, draws the observer in so effectively that sometimes the experience is participatory. The Glass Room is a novel that succeeds on so many levels that it becomes hard to review. The only comment is that you should read it. So why start with a shortcoming? Well, the start is as good a place as any to record The Glass Room\u2019s only weakness, which relates to the identity of the family that forms the book\u2019s focus, the Landauers. Victor has married Liesel. He is a rich man, an industrialist, an owner of a firm that makes cars. One would expect such a person to live and breathe his work rather more than he does. Consequently, he always seems less of a character than he surely ought to have been, rather aloof, something of a vehicle for the women involved. So the main criticism of a multi-themed, multi-layered book is that it could have pursued one more idea! But The Glass Room\u2019s real focus seems to be on the lives of its women. There are three central female characters that form the book\u2019s backbone. Much of the book\u2019s success is to see events separately, from their different individual perspectives. Liesel is a German speaker, married to the car-maker, Viktor, who is Jewish and Czech. They are rich, unapologetically so, and commission a famous architect to design and build a house to be their family home near Prague. It is to be a house to end all houses. The Glass Room is the result, al ultra-modern, modernist, Bauhaus house with more light than can be imagined. Significantly, its areas of glass make it open to the world, a transparency within which a marriage grows gradually murkier towards the opaque. Hana \u2013 let\u2019s use a shortened version of her name \u2013 is a family friend. She is rather off-beat compared to the apparently conventional Landauers. Initially we know little of her own domestic life, circumstances that become highly significant later on. Hana becomes Liesel\u2019s confidante, her closest friend. Her economic status is not that of the Landauers, but this does not seem to create a barrier. Kata is a different kind of twentieth century heroine. She creates a life for herself with apparent pragmatism beneath the protecting umbrella of <---C>Viktor Landauer</---C>\u2019s wealth and power. It may appear that he retains the upper hand, that he always writes the rules, but this story is more subtle than that. When war comes the Glass Room is left behind. It changes. A deranged fascist project occupies its space. (Does that sentence contain a tautology?) A self-deceiving but damaged psychopath exploits an ideologically-driven, self-justifying search for a science of race. At least these scientists know what they are looking for. It\u2019s a pity they must remain blind to the results. What they found they sought to enjoy, but it wasn\u2019t knowledge. The war affects each character differently and we follow them and their fortunes across Europe and across continents. Interestingly, it\u2019s the economically advantaged who have the best chances. As in history, the poor just disappear. And by the end we have lived the characters\u2019 lives almost alongside them. We have sensed the joy, the terror, the suffering and, most acutely, the deception and duplicity. The author\u2019s footnote states that Der Glasraum does not necessarily translate to The Glass Room, since \u201craum\u201d means something less defined, something more, like space or environment. The book captivates, its characters confide in us, but paradoxically the image of The Glass Room only rarely suggests transparency. ...more In the 1920's, wealthy, Jewish Czech businessman Viktor Landauer and his bride, Liesel, hire German avantgarde architect, Rainer von Abt, to design an ultra-modern home for them. An unconventional \"upside down\" blueprint creates space from a house, rather than creating a house from space. Von Abt considers himself a poet of form, space, and light. These revolutionary ideas usurp the notion of ornamentation. Gables, pillars, columns, turrets, and whatnot are oppressively rooted in the past, and i In the 1920's, wealthy, Jewish Czech businessman Viktor Landauer and his bride, Liesel, hire German avantgarde architect, Rainer von Abt, to design an ultra-modern home for them. An unconventional \"upside down\" blueprint creates space from a house, rather than creating a house from space. Von Abt considers himself a poet of form, space, and light. These revolutionary ideas usurp the notion of ornamentation. Gables, pillars, columns, turrets, and whatnot are oppressively rooted in the past, and invoke churches and museums. The Landauer House will transcend the new optimism of Central Europe with its straight lines and understatement. The Glass Room is the nadir of the Laundauer House. Transparency and light prevail, bouncing on walls and chrome pillars, and even reflecting on the garden dew. The house and the garden, as the architect designed, flow as one, without discontinuous separations. Von Abt installs a stunning onyx wall in the Glass Room, a glossy slab with veins of amber and honey. The stone captures and radiates the light; when the sun sets over the house and shimmers and sparkles on the stone, it glows a fiery red. People transform into transparent selves--they are guileless, liberated, ungoverned. In this expansive, unrestrained sphere, they make love--to each other and to life, in this room of substantive dialogue and naked emotions. Moreover, the house is a citadel of exuberant faith, an anchor of hope for future generations. The main character is the Landauer House, specifically the Glass Room, which is also the leitmotif of the book and symbol of order and progress in otherwise irrational times. As WW II obtrudes, a Nazi invasion is imminent. Viktor and Liesel and their two children are forced to leave and live as refugees. Accompanying them are Katalin, the winsome, alluring nanny, and her young daughter. By that time, life has become complicated and their marriage corrupted with deceit. As they depart for Switzerland, Liesel begs her best friend, Hana, to keep a close eye on their house, and \"der Glasraum.\" The Landauer House, which stood for the indomitable future and the erasure of the past, becomes its own history of hope through struggle and war. During the unstable, treacherous German onslaught, the house becomes a scientific laboratory whose ultimate aim is to promote ethnic cleansing. Later, the Landauer's sinister chauffeur becomes the keeper, then a hostage, and finally a champion of the Soviet invasion. The Glass Room stands as a bastion of optimism amid menacing threats and perilous challenges to freedom and humanity. Written in eloquent, luminous prose, the novel soars from beginning to end, engulfing the reader into a world that is part-dream, part-imagination, and frightfully real. The latter part of the novel has a few encumbrances--it feels hurried and hamstrung, fitting too many events, people, and perfunctory dramas into a condensed frame. And yet, it doesn't deform this shattering, beautiful story. A bird with a broken wing trills its eternal song. Hope, freedom, history, and love prevail in an upside down house, in a glass room. The fictional Landauer House is based on architect Mies van der Rohe's Villa Tugendhat in Brno.

I didn't think anything too suspicious until the architect was introduced and I was like, that's not Mies van Der Rohe...I checked the website again and none of the names matched. WTF?! Then I went back to the book and discovered it was fiction. Bummer... I continued reading until SPOILER ALERT Liesl and her best friend went back to her apartment and they were going to try to determine the sex of the baby using the wedding ring. Next thing we know, the woman is fingering Liesl and she kinda likes it. but they will never speak of it again. Then I had to see who was writing the book, a man. yep. I am a straight woman and I will be turning 40 this year. I've had some of my current female friends for over 25 years. Crazy as it may sound, we have never just spontaneously felt the need to finger each other. I felt like I was reading someone's cheesy fan fiction fantasy. I'm the author and I've got two female characters together. I'm going to have them make out. I read a little more and decided I was disgusted with it.

They hired the German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and gave him free rein to design an avant-garde structure that looks like a Mondrian painting in three dimensions: a long, low building of dramatic straight lines, marked by a large room with floor-to-ceiling glass walls. Unbelievably, this elegant house survived the dismemberment of the First During the pause between world wars, a Jewish businessman and his new wife commissioned a startlingly modern house for themselves in Czechoslovakia. They hired the German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and gave him free rein to design an avant-garde structure that looks like a Mondrian painting in three dimensions: a long, low building of dramatic straight lines, marked by a large room with floor-to-ceiling glass walls. Unbelievably, this elegant house survived the dismemberment of the First Republic of Czechoslovakia, German bombing, Soviet invasion and the natural forces that conspire against a neglected building. The Villa Tugendhat, which has been a public museum since the mid-1990s, remains a masterpiece of minimalist architecture, and now it's the evocative setting for a stirring new novel that almost won this year's Booker Prize. The author, Simon Mawer, moves through six decades of European history, much of it unspeakably tragic, using the glass house as a window on the hopes and fears of its various inhabitants and the conflicts that rip Europe apart. Pianists and Nazis, doctors and servants, everyone is drawn to the living room's extraordinary vista and feels aroused by the promise of such clarity: This is \"a place of balance and reason,\" Mawer writes, \"an ageless place held in a rectilinear frame that handles light like a substance and volume like a tangible material and denies the very existence of time.\" But the architecture proves purer than the human spirit. Again and again, the residents of this glass house find they can't tolerate the light of full disclosure even as they're attracted to it. Mawer has recast the original owner of the house as a sophisticated automobile magnate named Viktor Landauer. An idealist determined to throw off the trappings of religion, aristocracy and nationalism, he's prone to grand slogans about the future and eager to enlist a mesmerizing young architect from Germany, \"a poet of space and structure\" who shares his sense of the exciting new world. \"Ever since Man came out of the cave he has been building caves around him,\" Mies tells Viktor. \"But I wish to take Man out of the cave and float him in the air. I wish to give him a glass space to inhabit.\" Viktor finds these ideas captivating, no matter how expensive. This is the \"dream that went with the spirit of a brand new country in which they found themselves,\" he thinks, \"a state in which being Czech or German or Jew would not matter, in which democracy would prevail and art and science would combine to bring happiness to all people.\" Mawer spreads the dramatic irony pretty thick here in the first part of the novel. With trouble already smoldering in Germany, two or three toasts to the gloriously peaceful future would have been plenty. Fortunately, he's more interesting and subtle in bringing out the small, private ways in which these characters fail to live up to their ideals. The Landauers' glass house has the effect \"of liberating people from the strictures and conventions of the ordinary, of making them transparent,\" but that turns out to be a Foucauldian nightmare, more problematic than anyone realizes. Honestly, could you live in a place \"where there will be no secrets\"? While the architect insists his clients don't need walls, Viktor discovers that, in fact, parts of his life must remain cloistered. His wife, Liesel, announces to a curious public that \"living inside a work of art is an experience of sublime delight,\" but she doesn't know what Viktor is doing in the back streets of Vienna. And soon their happy marriage becomes a kind of stage performance, free for all to see but deeply deceptive. \"The Glass Room\" works so effectively because Mawer embeds these provocative aesthetic and moral issues in a war-torn adventure story that's eerily erotic and tremendously exciting. No matter how transparent and luminescent their architecture, the Landauers still ride the murky currents of history. The house endures, \"plain, balanced, perfect; and indifferent,\" but the family is swept aside by the battles that tear through Czechoslovakia. In the second half of the novel, Mawer rotates several different casts through the Landauers' home, using the glass room to examine people entirely unlike the original owners. In one of the most chilling sections, a German geneticist sets up his laboratory in the abandoned house and hopes the light of science will confirm Hitler's racial propaganda. His work is peaceful -- lots of careful measuring and photographing, \"the cool gaze of scientific objectivity\" -- but that only renders the whole enterprise more obscene. And like everyone else who lives in this glass room, he finds that such bright exposure makes him more determined to conceal the darkest aspects of his life. Mawer, an Englishman living in Italy, has written this novel as though it were a translation, endowing his prose with a patina of Old World formality that sounds all the more romantic. He claims he doesn't know Czech or German, but his characters speak both fluently, and his attention to foreign languages enriches every episode. These are, after all, people caught in the violent confluence of political upheaval; choosing to speak Czech or German or English becomes a matter of resistance or collusion or hope. And at crucial moments, certain foreign words illuminate the story in poignant ways, as when a Czech resident of the Landauers' old house realizes that \"the word he used for room, pokoj, can also mean peace, tranquillity, quiet. So when he said 'the glass room' he was also saying 'the glass tranquillity.' \" In chapter after chapter, era after era, the house miraculously continues, working as a talisman, \"its spirit of transparency percolating the human beings who stand within it, rendering them as translucent as the glass itself.\" Like this gorgeous novel, that's an irresistible promise, though far more troubling than it first appears. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/... ...more Fifteen years ago the author visited the Tugendhat house in Czechoslovakia which is the house upon which this novel is based on.

Despite the historical Fifteen years ago the author visited the Tugendhat house in Czechoslovakia which is the house upon which this novel is based on. Designed by Ludwig Miles van der Rohe it is considered an icon of modern architecture. So highly regarded is it that is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. From the information available the house in this book would appear to be a replica of the real house and is the one centre piece constant throughout the novel in a world of chaos and disintegration. Despite the historical backdrop which encompasses the Nazis, war, communism and all the rest it, the house remains, a symbol perhaps of the indestructibility of the human spirit and hope for the future. This is primarily a story of optimism. Throughout the story all the characters are looking to improve themselves and their lives, always looking forwards. And it follows, for once, that for a story about war and destruction it does actually have a happy ending. Liesel and Viktor (who is Jewish) Landauer commission the house to be built in 1929. Its erection coincides with the pregnancy and birth of the couple's first child, symbolic of the new life as a family within the walls of the house. The plot follows the well known history of the time with the taking over of Austria and then Czechoslovakia by the Germans, the refugees who arrive in the locality, anti semitism and how it all affects this family, their friends and associates. The family escape to Switzerland in 1938, leaving the house to its fate, and after a hurried journey across Europe in around 1942 finally finish up in the USA. The house meantime lives through and survives to the modern day, and at the end of the story becomes the focus for the conclusion. The Glass Room is the main living room of the house, and encompasses the whole front expanse of the building with huge window panes of glass and an onyx wall. So much of the critical elements and events of the story take place in this room. This is a fabulous piece of story telling, giving a slightly different take on the thousands of novels that have come out of the horror of the WWII, the Nazis, the holocaust, Communist rule, and subsequent breakdown. All that stuff happens in the background, the focus in this story is the people to whom it is happening too. There is some beautiful writing, without being overly sentimental, just a little mind you! I did find some of the characters a bit flat though, not enough depth or roundness to them. With the exception perhaps of Hana who is Liesl's best friend. Although she is not one of the main characters of the story, she certainly comes across as the most complex and interesting. A most worthwhile book, that does take a little while to get going - till about page 75 from memory, but then the switch for me suddenly came on and I was away with it. ...more The Short of It: The Glass Room is a sophisticated, highly stylized work of art.

Viktor, quite the modernist himself, is taken with the idea. A room made of glass? How exquisite. Liesel on the other hand, must be convinced. A house like this is not meant for a family, is it? Once complete, the house is a work of art. Cement and steel and of course, the large glass panels that make up the glass room. As von Abt states: \"A work of art like this demands that the life lived in it be a work of art as well.\" The life lived within it is not a work of art though. Instead, there is a marriage placed crudely under a microscope where the reader is allowed to view all of its intricacies. There is love, much love but there is also rampant infidelity, lesbianism, and matters of race, religion and politics. Mawer places it all before you and then steps back, allowing the reader to be an observer in this experiment. The writing is clinical, almost sterile yet sensual. Everyone in this novel is stripped bare. The characters, all of them, are complex creatures but we are reminded more than once that they are in fact, creatures and they often behave as animals do. Sometimes this is shocking because as you read, you feel as if you shouldn\u2019t be sharing this intimate space with them. Yet, you cannot walk away. \"Don\u2019t be fooled by the Glass Room. It\u2019s only as rational as the people who inhabit it.\" Sharp and edgy, I found myself completely absorbed with the story. What makes it even more intriguing is that such a house exists. Villa Tugendhat is located in Brno in the Czech Republic and the inspiration behind The Glass Room. It was designed by Mies van der Rohe between 1928 and 1930. Although the story centers around this house, the rest of the story is a work of fiction. With a large part of the novel centering around World War II, it\u2019s no wonder that the words, sterile and antiseptic come to mind but in between the starkness, there is beauty. A lot of other reviewers did not care for the coldness of the characters. I didn\u2019t see them as cold, but somewhat reserved depending on the situation. Formal, is probably a better word. As formal as they were, the last page brought a tear to my eye. I wasn\u2019t expecting to tear up but emotion overcame me and I found myself re-reading that last page over and over again. ...more It took me a while to warm up to The Glass Room but when I finished it I had goose bumps all over.

Viktor and Liesel Landauer are wealthy and privileged. He is a Jew who owns a car company and money is no object to them. When the book opens in Czechoslovakia in 1929, life is carefree and easy for them. However, Viktor shortly begins an affair with a woman named Kata and this continues for several years. The times remind me of the 1960\u2019s. Sex is loose and free and people are curious about art, their bodies, and the world at large. Hana, Liesel\u2019s best friend, is a very open and curious woman who appears to have no bounds to her sexuality and curiosity. The main character in this exalting book is the glass room. It appears to have different meanings to those who inhabit it: \u201c \u201ca place that is at once of nature and quite aside from nature\u201d; \u201can idea developing into a work of art\u201d; \u201cthe house was both the work of art and the atelier in which it was being created\u201d; \u201cBeauty made manifest\u201d; life lived in it be a work of art as well\u201d; \u201ctransparent and full of light\u201d; \u201ca place of dreams, a cool box where you can project your fantasies and sit and watch them\u201d. We watch as the war comes to Czechoslovakia and we see the horrors of World War II. The Landauers flee to Switzerland and the house is taken over by the Germans. Later the house is resided in by the Soviets. With each resident the house takes on different themes and meanings. The characters are richly described and the drama of their lives gives meaning to the novel. Mawer is a fine historian and appears well versed on the invasion of Europe during the second World War. The impact on the Landauers and Kata is horrifically described and shivers ran up and down my spine as I was reading. This is a book to savor, one that will never leave me. It is powerful, haunting, and brilliant. It grows on you slowly but once in its realm, you are powerless to leave. I will read other books by Mawer but wonder how any book can come up to this masterpiece. ...more While Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel was winning the 2009 Booker, Simon Mawer was one of the nominees losing for The Glass Room.

No reader needs a Magic Eight Ball to see what's coming. It's the 20's, Viktor is an educated Jew and Germany is their backyard. That being said knowing the historical events that will surround the fictional characters of a historical novel in no way precludes your pleasure and respect for the novel. Rather your knowledge of history should be brought to a human level, a sympathetic level by the writer's ability to tell a story within a historical context. That doesn't always happen. It does here. As the worst of 20th century history moves forward in the novel various people will come and go from the glass house. These are not people who are going to change history this is not that kind of novel. These are the people trying to get through the war and what life brings them next as best they can. The real survivor here is the house. Over a 60 year period history comes to this house nothing happens outside of it. The house is all of us. It doesn't make anything happen it is a mute and static witness. I don't want to put the hex on The Glass Room by saying it is a novel of ideas but that is exactly what it is-- but that is not all that it is. The brilliant characters and the plot lines are all there to propel the reader along. This isn't a dry, philosophical, God help me when will this end book you had to read for school. This is effulgent writing that views the last 60 years from a very interesting stage.

At first I was reluctant to live in Nazi Europe for this read, but Mawer didn't take me down the usual, predictable roads. While the historical setting is of course at times chilling, his characters vibrated against the historical/political setting and remained in the forefront, most especially Hana, who transcended typical gender-societal roles so believably and beautifully. I liked Mawer's alternating of past and present tense narrative. If I had one criticism--it was stupifying, with his brilliant imaginings, that he used weather metaphors to describe political upheavals. I wanted to slap him for annoying me out of what otherwise was compelling narrative. Also, the end felt rushed, with a new generation of characters to meet--a bold addition as the novel comes to its close--some interesting writing/editing choices made here, I am sure. This is more of a literary novel than a page-turner, and yet Mawer got me so invested in his characters I found myself rushing for closure to the very end. ...more Another fictional account of the suffering caused by WWII with the setting a real house designed by Mies Van der Rohe in the Czech Republic.
