{"Comments": "Better than the last book, not as good as the first. Altogether an interesting story, but the pace of the series is very slow and if GRRM mentions one more banner/sigil, I'm gonna lose it... I'm seeing a lot of negative reviews about this book: people complaining about a slow story line and a ridiculously cruel world where anyone can be killed off without a second thought. My response is: if you want a quick,<---M> happy clappy mushy book</---M>, you need to get yourself to the romance section. Or even better, the young adult section. My biggest pet peeve in books is feeling that characters are safe.<---F> I want people to die</---F>. I want people to be miserable.

My response is: if you want a quick, happy clappy mushy book, you need to get yourself to the romance section. Or even better, the young adult section. My biggest pet peeve in books is feeling that characters are safe. I want people to die. I want people to be miserable. It tells me that the author is serious and that shit is going to get real. Sure, a happy moment every now and then would be nice, but the harsh realities in the world George Martin has created is a breath of fresh air. The character development is fantastic and I almost feel as if I've known these characters all my life. The story line can be slow at times, but that is what fantasy authors just tend to do, so get over it (<---B>LOTR, anyone?</---B>). Climactic events have me sitting on the proverbial edge of my seat because I know that it can go either way. Predictability has gone out the window, and although I like to believe I know where the story is going, George Martin proves time and time again that I just don't. Now let me stop waffling and get on with the next book! ...more \"Night falls for all of us in the end, and too soon for some.\u201d Part 1 of A Storm of Swords was less exciting than it's companions.

They definitely belong to my favourite characters and make all the events in King's Landing even more exciting. While I really like Brienne I don't care much for yet another long journey with unexpected(parts annoying) turns through Westeros. They stumble and get dragged through places and by characters that I do not have any interest in - same goes for Arya. And I don't like Jaime very much. Catelyn's story is pretty much the same every time, a lot of mourning and sorrow. While I like her and Robb very much, it's still unnerving. Davos and Stannis would be extremely boring as well if it weren't for the Red Lady. So here are the many POVs, starting with the chapters I liked the most down to the ones I didn't: Daenerys Tyrion Sansa Jon Bran Samwell Arya Davos Catelyn Jaime ...more Das geeiiiiilste Buch bisher OKAY SO I'M DONE PART 1!! I feel a little intimidated since this is, um, a 600-page part one . Oh gosh. What have I done by getting so embroiled in this series?! THERE IS NO ESCAPE. But I'm supposed to be reviewing this. Right. Let's get on with it. A Storm of Swords (so far) has been waaaay better than A Clash of Kings. It's faster! More action! More character development! There haven't been many surprising or awful deaths (at least of the main characters). And some of the barely-introduced-chara OKAY SO I'M DONE PART 1!! I feel a little intimidated since this is, um, a 600-page part one . Oh gosh. What have I done by getting so embroiled in this series?! THERE IS NO ESCAPE. But I'm supposed to be reviewing this. Right. Let's get on with it. A Storm of Swords (so far) has been waaaay better than A Clash of Kings. It's faster! More action! More character development! There haven't been many surprising or awful deaths (at least of the main characters). And some of the barely-introduced-characters of the last book have been fleshed out more now. (I particularly love Brienne.) Samwell and Jaime Lannister both got turns at narrating (!!) and the characters did more, instead of just sitting around talking about it. I won't talk about ALL the characters, just the narrators. SO HERE WE GO: + Jaime: We start the book in his POV and, omg, did I used to hate Jaime? HOW COULD I HATE JAIME?!! He's absolutely snarky, witty, and fabulous and I suddenly have a very soft spot for him. I, um, accidentally ship him and Cersei? HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN??? But, to be honest, Jaime is devoted, never cheats, and seriously actually truly loves her. Unlike 99% of the other dudes in this series. But, nunnnngh. I feel so conflicted about this ship. OBVIOUSLY. But I absolutely looked forward to Jaime's chapters. Plus I loved his interaction and development with Brienne. Omg, their friendship is precious...um, friendship? Hateship? I LOVE IT ANYWAY. Brienne is an adorable little darling who, in real life, I would probably come up to her elbow. So there's that. Omg and Jaime lost (view spoiler) [ HIS HAAAAND!! I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO DEVASTATED ABOUT SOMETHING. Well, apart from, like, all the death. But still. I wailed. I'm glad, though, that GRRM is developing his characters through injury/pain and not just lopping off all their heads. (hide spoiler) ] + Tyrion: Omg, I felt SO SORRY for Tyrion. He's basically been fired as being Hand of the King, he's being bullied around by his father, and totally manipulated. No one appreciates him. None caaaaares. OMG POOR DARLING TYRION. (view spoiler) [ I was surprised when he married Sansa, but at the same time, is this weird of me? But I was glad it was him and not someone heartlessly and mindlessly cruel. I was freakishly worried he'd rape her but YAY TYRION HAS SOME HONOUR. (hide spoiler) ] + Sansa: I've slowly grown to love Sansa. Mostly I think of her as a tiny kicked kitten that just needs a cuddle, but her chapters are always fascinating because she's such a flower on the wall. Everyone thinks she's stupid, so she hears ALL THE THINGS. I just feel so sorry for her because even when someone's horrible to her, she assumes they're out to be evil. Poor little mite. I can't believe she's only 13... + Catelyn: AH. CATELYN. She's not doing anything stupid (like, um, starting a war) in this book, thank goodness. But, I never really enjoy her chapters because I have to suffer Robb. OH ROBB YOU CURLY HEADED FOOL. He's forever making stupid decisions...like how he abandons his oath (view spoiler) [to the Freys and marries some random low-born lass. Once upon a time I would've said, \"YES I AM FOR TRUE LOVE\" but omg, not in Westeros, you freaking fools . Marry the RIGHT person so no one kills you. ERghhhh. (hide spoiler) ] . And how he usually abandons Catelyn's totally wise counsel. Idiot. + Jon Snow: OMG MA BABY JON. I LOVE JON. JON IS LIKE MY LITTLE CURLY HAIRED ADORABLE ICICLE. He's with the Wildlings now and, omg, I ship him and Ygritte so so hard. Unfortunately, Jon spends most of his time having existential crises and smooching Ygritte. But it's probably the \"happiest\" he's been all book. But he still doesn't belong anywhere and he keeps nearly dying and an eagle ate his face at one point. I still love Jon. He's an IDIOT for splitting up with Ghost though. + Samwell: Since Jon isn't with the main host to narrate what's happening with the Black Brothers, we get Sam. YAAAY!! I LOVE SAM. He's pathetic, but he's also endearing at the same time. Plus he's honest. He's like the most honest person around. But, omg, I cried when (view spoiler) [Lord Commander Mormont (hide spoiler) ] died in his arms!! THAT WAS SO CRUEL. The dude got through a battle with the Undead, and then died in a squabble over food?!! I hope Sam lives a long time, but ya know, I love him so he might die. Boo. + Arya: Again her part was more interesting than in ACoK, but she still spent most of the time going around in circles and not getting anywhere. She basically gets kidnapped by the Westeros version of Robin Hood and his gang. So that's interesting if not entirely not moving the plot along. + Bran: Same as above. LIKE I LOVE BRAN. But I don't like nine pages of what it's like to be a dire wolf and eat deer and smell all the things. Yeah, nope. Don't care. BUT BRAN IS ADORABLE. And I love his friendship with Jojen and Mira. + Davos: NOBODY CARES, DAVOS. He's like a poor little limpet serving a sucky king who doesn't really like him. BUT YEAH. I don't care. Stannis could be dancing in a tutu on top of King's Landing and I still would rather skip past Davos' chapters. + Danaerys: OKAY SHE'S DOWNRIGHT AWESOME. She's becoming more queenly now, which means taking less crap from stupid men. YAY. Although with Jorrah being \"in love\" with her? Ew. I'm glad she's telling him no. He probably could be her FATHER. Ahem. And there was that part where she nearly \"sold\" her (view spoiler) [ dragon and I FREAKED OUT. I was so angry I just stopped reading for a while because HOW COULD SHE EVER THINK TO DO THAT??? DARN YOU DANNI THAT'S TOTALLY OUT OF CHARACTER. But. Yes. It was okay. She didn't. (hide spoiler) ] I think Dani has a cruel streak, but daaaang, if she doesn't sit the Iron Throne I'm going to cry, to be honest. So basically I loved it. I'm shipping the wrong ships (CERSEI AND JAIME THO) and I'm absolutely rooting for the mountainous Brienne and I want someone to appreciate Tyrion and I want Jon to be happy and I want someone to rescue Sansa. I'M REALLY EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED AND I KNOW THAT'S BAD. I figure part 2 is going to be horrific, but we'll see, shall we? Onwards! Onwards! By the way, I'm still listening to this on audio and I think it's the best way to go. The accents are GREAT, although I feel like the narrator lost it a few times and gave the wrong people the wrong voices. It really messed me up. BUT. He fixed himself. Still, the audios help me remember all the things and stay really involved with the story. BUT I LOVE THIS SERIES AND I DON'T WANT TO BECAUSE IT'S GONNA MELT MY MIND LIKE A MARSHMALLOW WHEN ALL THE BAD STUFF GOES DOWN.

Tyrion Lannister is his usual swashbuckling self with a sharper sense of violence honed through bloody battle and everyday dealing with his treacherous domesticated life. Robb Stark breaks an oath and gains comfort of the flesh \u2013 a choice sure to have ramifications on the war effort. While King Joffrey continues to echo the sentiments of a mad King \u2013 perhaps his fate will mirror that of Arrys (one can but hope)? Fan favourites continue to evolve (Arya, Jon, Robb Stark, Sansa, Cersei. Davos the Onion Knight etc.) while newer faces begin their slow rise to prominence (such as The Red Viper, Lady in Red, Stannis, Samwell etc.) through an intrinsically finely weaved web of violence, betrayal, magic, love, and duty. Continuing the series evolution, the fantastical elements are becoming paramount to the core plot with a heavy emphasis on the unnatural and the mythic tales of wet nurses springing true from storybook to reality. There is a subtle beauty to the way Martin sneaks in these creatures of man and monster alike. So gentle is the hand that caresses their introduction that I had to reread certain passages as to ensure I didn\u2019t misinterpret or skim over what was happening (this was not a chore and further enhanced Martins storytelling ability \u2013 this book is loaded with worthwhile double-takes). A particular interest of mine is the mysterious landscape over the Wall. Thankfully, the Brothers of the Black, Wildlings, and Others feature relatively frequently in this instalment. Martin did have a tendency to exhaust the readers\u2019 ability to follow the detailed and elaborate history of his well defined world and complex cast of characters by devoting generous passages to the multitude of back-stories. That said; I did enjoy reading the Kingslayers tale of how is moniker was attained and retained and the perception of his honour that both curses and praises him. Dubbed as more a companion piece to \u2018A Clash of Kings\u2019 rather than a true sequel (as per the author intro) with chapters detailing events amidst the feverish battles of the previous book, I felt \u2018<+++>A Storm of Swords: Steel and Snow</+++>\u2019 actually worked well as a sequel as many of its entries were a direct result of the preceding books outcomes. Much like the previous instalments, if not more so, \u2018A Storm of Swords: Steel and Snow\u2019 has left me craving more of this world and its deep and violent history \u2013 4 stars. ...more \u0394\u03b5\u03bd \u03be\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 \u03b1\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03bf \u03ae \u03b1\u03bd \u03bf\u03c6\u03b5\u03af\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03bf \"nerd\" \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03b1\u03bd\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ce \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 :) Westeros is still in the grip of the War.

Catelyn Stark has released Jaime Lannister as an exchange for her daughters, Sansa and Arya, who she still believes are at King's Landing. Having been victorious until now, Robb Stark suffers setbacks, and learns that Winterfell has been taken, and his other brothers are now presumed dead. In the North the Wildlings are marching on the wall, with a pitiful small force of Night's Watch to counteract them. With the wights also attacking them, they realise the odds are so far stacked against until they realise that there is a possible way to defeat these creatures of the night. In the east Daenerys Targaryen is trying to raising forces to retake the Iron throne, which she sees as her divine right. She encounters slave trading, and makes plans to release these people from they captors. As the players in the game of thrones move their pieces, the stakes are raised higher and higher. In this world you win; or you die. Martin has managed to continue this epic tale of the land of Westeros in the same vain as before. There is not so much action in this one, but you get a full realisation that he is setting the scenes for the next books as the characters develop and grow, rise and fall, win and die. He is not afraid to eliminate characters as you get to know them, and occasionally even like them. This world that he has created is tough and brutal, and I like that way that the underlying magic, adds a little zing to all that is happening. But what makes this series so good is the political manoeuvring and intrigue that he has infused into this land. As alliances are forged and broken, loyalties are tested beyond all measure. ...more *4.5 stars* EPIC AS FUCK. Can't wait to read part two! It is a good book. Rationally I know this.

Too many storylines. Too many things happening in different places. AHHH. My poor head. The things is, I care about too few of the PoV characters in these books to make any of them a quick read. I'm sorry, but the individual chapters are simply too short for me to properly bond with anyone who doesn't possess a personality that naturally resonates with me. And it's so frustrating, because I find most of the storylines (and characters) exciting and compelling, I'm just not getting enough of any of them to really get into it. They're like sub-stories, with some a vague (or not so vague) relation to a main story that's hinted at (ALL THE TIME), but won't be revealed till the final book AND IT IS SO ANNOYING. Because am I supposed to read each chapter, because I care about said character and want to know what happens to them? Because I don't. You can't give me 10 pages for every 100 I read and expect me to emotionally bond with ALL (or any) of them. I'll hand it to Martin that he writes all of the characters well, despite them all being so different. They all have their own voices, and that is the mark of a great writer. It's not that the chapters are bad (although some are more exciting than others) it's that they're too short. It's a matter of personal taste, of course. I'd simply prefer fewer PoV characters and longer PoV chapters, and if that lessens the epic scale of the series, then I'm okay with it. I'll keep reading though, because Martin is an incredible writer, and I know hanging on will pay of a hundred times in the end, but right now I am very frustrated. I have hopes that things change with A Feast For Crows and A Dance With Dragons, what with having to split the PoV's up - so more time for each character! - but perhaps things will already get better in the second half.

Martin is sheer brilliance when it comes to creating an exciting world for readers. Even now, after reading over 2,000 pages of A Song of Ice and Fire, George R.R. Martin is adding details that deepen our knowledge of the land, the history and the people of this spectacular world, and he does so without overwhelming us. He clearly puts an immense amount of work into his art, allowing us to really construct Westeros in our mind and form connections with the characters we love whilst being utterly repulsed by the characters we loathe. *cough* Joffrey *cough* Cersei. Yet again, character development in this book is just magnificent. Arya Stark is slowly becoming one of my favourite fictional characters, and I love reading scenes with her and Gendry. (I totally want them to get together and grow old and have little warrior babies together). Tyrion is another favourite of mine, as from the start. He\u2019s witty, amusing and exciting and it\u2019s a joy to read his chapters, even just for his dialogue. So far I have enjoyed the addition of the Tyrells, and they\u2019re pretty high in my estimation for now simply because they try to help Sansa. My feelings towards Sansa Stark have changed the most out of anyone. I\u2019ve gone from considering her a bratty, little snob of a girl, to feeling for her as a victim, and finally to admiring the clever, young woman she is becoming. My favourite addition to this book, however, are the chapters involving Brienne and Jaime. I need not say much for Brienne, simply that she\u2019s awesome. She\u2019s loyal, kind, innocent and brave. I want a friend like Brienne. Now, on to Jaime. Previously, Jaime wasn\u2019t exactly a strong contender for \u201cTop Character I Feel For\u201d in ASOIAF. What he did to Bran, how he helped Ned\u2019s downfall, and his relationship with Cersei (that s**t seriously just makes my skin crawl, ew.) are a strong recipe for dislike. We are, however, beginning to see the better side and the true depth of this character in A Storm of Swords Part One, and I can\u2019t wait to see more. And I want him and Brienne to fall in love at some point... (Does anyone else agree?) Finally, I want to discuss one more person \u2013 Daenerys. I haven\u2019t exactly been shy in the past about how I think she\u2019s a whiny, moaning bitch. This still stands, and I\u2019m gonna add cruel bitch to the list too because I think she\u2019s a meanie moo to Jorah, but... I actually really enjoyed reading her chapters in this book, woooo! Of everything that has been included in her chapters, the Unsullied have been the best. I love how she handled the whole affair, and I can\u2019t wait to see how things unfold with them in the future. I\u2019ve seen people comment on how this book drags, or is uninteresting in comparison to the first two. People need to remember that this began as a hell of a long book and it\u2019s been chopped in half for the ease of some readers. Treated as a lone book it could be pretty disappointing, but as the first half of a larger book, it\u2019s a great run up to bigger and better things. Predictability is currently standing at zero, and I\u2019m expecting lots of drama in the next book, and have been foretold by my brother that the next one is amazing... ...more Thanks to my friends.

One is black, the other white. There is ice and there is fire. Hate and love. Bitter and sweet. Male and female. Pain and pleasure. Winter and summer. Evil and good. Death and life.\" A Storm Of Swords continues right where A Clash Of Kings ended. The war between the Five Kings continues (well, at this moment four, to be honest; Robb Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Joffrey Baratheon and Balon Greyjoy; Renly sadly didn't make it through a dark night full of terrors...). Stannis tried to take King's Landing, but failed miserably. It was an intense fight and I must admit that I was kind of team-Stannis, although I would have hated it if Sansa didn't make it. Speaking of Sansa, her life is changing for the better. Although, so it seemed. The Small Council decided that an alliance with House Tyrell would be good, so King Joffrey is to be married to Margaery Tyrell, widow of Renly Baratheon. Sansa is free of the cruel boy and Margaery and her grandmother Olenna, \"The Queen of Torns\", treat her very well. Yet, her luck changes too quickly: she is to be married to Tyrion Lannister, who she sees as an ugly dwarf. \"Love\u2019s not always wise, I\u2019ve learned. It can lead us to great folly, but we follow our hearts ... wherever they take us.\" I might have been team-Stannis in the fight for Kings Landing; in the ultimate war for the throne I am team-Stark. In A Storm Of Swords we read about Robb's fight through his mothers eyes. And Robb is not making the best decisions. He might be winning a lot of battles, he is not making friends: while being engaged to one of the daughters of Walder Frey, he marries another girl he fell in love with. All very sweet, but incredibly dumb. His younger sister Ayra is on an adventure of her own and becomes quite tough on the way. \"Old stories are like old friends. You have to visit them from time to time.\" The Night's Watch have a confrontation with the White Walkers on the Fist of the First Men. The person who seems most unlikely to shine on a moment like this, actually does: Sam Tarly kills a White Walker, using a blade of dragonglass. Jon Snow is on his own expedition without The Night's Watch, joining the wildings north of the Wall. He is constantly in a fight with himself; to which camp does he belong? Definitely since he seems to be falling in love with the wilding Ygritte (loved her in the tv-series, but love her even more in the book) You know nothing, Jon Snow. Jon's \"brother\" Bran is also on his way to the other side of the Wall. He is able to live through his wolves eyes and his companion Jojen can see certain aspects of the future. I am definitely very curious where this story line is heading. I can feel Bran will become extremely important in later books. Tyrion: \"You hide behind courtesy as if it were a castle wall.\" Sansa: \"Courtesy is a lady's armor.\" Finally, let's talk about Daenerys. If you've seen the tv-series, there are several epic parts you just want to read about, one being the one with the Unsullied, her dragons and Daenerys saying \"Dracarys\". All I can say is that that scene is extremely awesome. When I finished the chapter I had to reread it right away. Which was the same when I saw the episode for the first time; I just re-watched that bit over and over. Daenerys is one extremely bad-ass lady. Olenna: \"Margaery, you're clever, be a dear and tell your poor old half-daft grandmother the name of that queer fish from the Summer Isles that puffs up to ten times its own size when you poke it.\" Margaery: \"They call them puff fish, Grandmother.\" Olenna: \"Of course they do, Summer Islanders have no imagination.\" I loved this book. I think this is my favorite so far. Just so much things happen. So much even, that sometimes I returned to a character after several chapters and completely forgot about that epic cliffhanger which connected to him or her. I would like to say I will take my time again and that I will not pick up the next book too soon, but who am kidding: I don't have that kind of power over myself. ...more New favorite character: Queen of Thorns. Other than that, I thought this book was the worst entry so far.

Oh, it's lingering on Ygritte's/Brienne's/Shae's \"teats.\" I will say, howevs, that I'm liking what Martin is doing with ability & injury. If masculinity in Westeros hinges around power, & power is only recognized when it flows through a capable, muscled-up warrior's body, what happens when that soldier is brutally injured? We've seen Bran coming to terms with his disability all along, but what about men like Jaime, a man who has been at the peak of his game until -- boom -- he up & loses his sword hand? How will this impact his role as the legendary Kingslayer? I'm sensing that as more & more of our male characters get injured in battle, we will see the food chains start to get shaken up. Soon, I'm guessing, Bran & Tyrion, will no longer be the only two characters who don't measure up to what it means to be a man in the Seven Kingdoms. We're also seeing a rise in the number of female warrior-types (Ygritte, Brienne). Their introduction to the story offers additional ways of being in Westeros. Girls can fight (well, that idea has been around in the novels since we first met Arya, but these women are showing it in action) but perhaps more importantly, boys can be attracted to girls who can fight. You don't just need to be into simpering maids drenched in jewels & silk -- you can *also* fall in love with Amazonian bad asses armored in animal hides & bones. Of course, this leads into what I've been observing since book 1: that there is little interest given (by the characters or the narrator) to the strength of femininity. Sansa & Cersei are good examples of this strength, although Martin repeatedly robs them of it. He makes Sansa into a foolish girl who keeps making stupid mistakes, while Cersei is the venomous femme fatale, the kind of soap opera diva you love to hate, but who lacks the human qualities of a fully realized character. I *loved* the scene in the novel where Sansa is invited to dine with Margaery Tyrell -- it was a glimpse of a female-only space that Martin rarely allows room for in his books. I want more of those kinds of moments. Hopefully in the following novels, Martin's non-masculine characters will grow & improve. Also Daenerys needs more magic. I want her to be the powerful dragon goddess Martin keeps hinting at! ...more \"A Tormenta de Espadas\" \u00e9 a primeira parte do original \"A Storm of Swords\", geralmente considerado o melhor volume publicado at\u00e9 agora das Cr\u00f3nicas de Gelo e Fogo, da autoria de George R.R.

Adding to the moral confusion, I feel for, and start to fear for the Hound as his path crosses Arya's, and start to ponder the 'right' outcome with regard to Stannis and Melisandre. In other news, Sansa Stark continues to only see worth in pretty things as she's wed to Tyrion, who meets a new, possibly quite formidable player, I'm saddened as yet more Stark children are parted from their wolves, and Jon has to add another betrayal to his belt as he comes within spitting distance of Bran. Every time I've thought that I can see what is coming I've had the rug pulled out from under me so I have absolutely no clue as to where else the story could be going from here, but I'm extremely glad that I've already bought the next one ready for me to carry on finding out. ...more Comecei este livro com grande expectativa e terminei-o j\u00e1 a acusar algum cansa\u00e7o.

Due to 'A Storm of Swords' colossal size, the book is split into two parts in the UK: 'Steel and Snow', and 'Blood and Gold'. Because of this, I decided it was unfair to review this book as a complete experience and will instead review it in the same way I might answer the question \"So how is it so far?\", as I'm technically only halfway through the entire thing. So, how is it so far? Short answer: it's good. Really good, in fact. In terms of the overarching narrative, not a great deal of shocking things happen in part one - which isn't entirely surprising. Forgetting the fact that I know what happens in part two (and it's my favourite season of the show so I'm very excited to see how the book portrays these events), I could appreciate how Martin was assembling the individual cogs of the machine, getting characters to where they needed to be ready for the explosive moments of part two. The new viewpoints are fascinating - especially Jaime's (who knew that a murdering, traitorous, sister-f****r could become such a likeable character) - and Lady Olenna really is my favourite grandmother in any novel ever, she's fantastic. Of course, as with any ASOIAF novel, there are some viewpoints that aren't as exciting as the others, particularly Davos, but the others are so good that it's worth ploughing through the ones you don't like just to revel in the brilliance that are Tyrion's chapters, or Jaime's. Overall, I really, really liked 'A Storm of Swords - Part One: Steel and Snow': it still has the same issues as the previous instalments with its sometimes excessive descriptions and some underwhelming viewpoints, but by taking the time to slowly establish the chess pieces ready to knock them all down in part two, 'Steel and Snow' has really made 'A Storm of Swords' look like it could be the strongest section of the series to date. ...more One thing I have to say about reading Martin's 'A Song of Ice and Fire' is that I can never go straight into the next one without getting some literary respite from a few other books first, despite the books always ending on about 20 different cliffhangers. The novels are well written, and obviously have had an immense amount of work put into the writing. However, firstly they're REALLY complex.

The novels are well written, and obviously have had an immense amount of work put into the writing. However, firstly they're REALLY complex. Just when you think you've got a handle on all the characters, another 5 pop up from somewhere, who you thought were dead, lost, joined the circus or just disappeared off the face of Westeros. As much as I love complex story-telling, it's just too much. You forget where characters are or should be, which results in endless flicking back to find out when you lost them, or turning to the back to read the lists of all the family members. Either way, this ruins the flow of your reading. Secondly, the stories are far too dragged out. I haven't read the last 3 books in the saga, but I honestly think the story could have been spread over 3 books and would have been one of the best trilogies of all time. It's hard to maintain hope for a character's plight when they've been plighting for the last book and a half. And knowing Martin, they'll probably just die soon anyway, so why bother caring about them? All in all, Martin needs to chill out and add some hope to his books to combat the utter despair felt when reading them. ...more You know, at this point I don\u2019t even know where to start talking about this series.

Martin is a sheer genius. I could literally leave this review there, but I suppose that would be unfair! A Storm of Swords Part One was a great read from the get go. The prologue raised the hairs on the back of my neck when the arrival of the Others was announced, and let\u2019s just say Chett\u2019s reaction was probably rather accurate. I\u2019m trying to think of how best to approach this review, and I think \u2018by king\u2019 might have to be the organisation. So let\u2019s start with my least favourite. Joffrey Baratheon is still the kind of person I would like to kick repeatedly in the face. With Tywin there to take over his official role as Hand, however, Joffrey is sort of held back a little from full stupidity. I\u2019m still undecided about my feelings for Tywin. I like that he doesn\u2019t take any of the shit that Cersei tries to dish out to everyone, but the way he treats Tyrion seriously grates on my nerves. Tyrion is still awesome, even with half a nose, but the way he treats Shae makes me want to shake him ridiculously hard. I think he forgets that she is a w h o r e, and is clearly in it for the money. Time will tell if I\u2019m right. The Tyrells are a great addition in my opinion. I like that the Queen of Thorns seems to know a lot more than she\u2019s letting on, and the fact that she tries to come up with a plan to help Sansa puts her pretty high in my estimation. When I think about my feelings for Sansa Stark, I actually chuckle to myself because they\u2019ve changed so much. I\u2019ve gone from hating a bratty little girl who, when you think about it, contributed to the death of her father and his men by telling Cersei what he was up to, to absolutely adoring the young woman she\u2019s slowing turning into. I wouldn\u2019t say she\u2019s a real contender yet, but she\u2019s picking up on the rules of the game and I think she\u2019s going to give people a run for their money as time moves on. I don\u2019t really have much to say about Stannis Baratheon. I kind of like that he has a genuine claim to the throne, but his storyline just doesn\u2019t interest me as much as the others. Davos being rescued was all well and good, but all he does it tell Stannis he\u2019s doing everything wrong and that Melissandre is evil. Well, I kind of like her and her mysteriousness (is that a word?). Ahhh King Robb, how I love the Starks. Robb is really growing up quite fast, and the difficulties he\u2019s facing as a king are really testing his character, and I love that he\u2019s \u2013 on the whole \u2013 pulling through. That being said, however, there\u2019s such a thing as too much bloody honour, boy! As much as I understand the whole Jeyne situation, just think of all the trouble that would\u2019ve been saved if he\u2019d just kept his promise to old Walder Frey. Bad move, Robb. Bad move. Catelyn is more difficult in this book. I completely get where she\u2019s coming from regarding Jaime Lannister, but I think she\u2019s just causing more trouble for herself and for Robb by interfering. The scenes with her father were interesting though, I\u2019ll be interested to find out what he was talking about in his delusional state of mind. Before I had read this book, I had heard a lot of people talking about how they \u2018shipped\u2019 Jaime with Brienne, and I just couldn\u2019t figure out why on earth they thought that from the little I knew of the two of them. This book has opened my eyes, let me tell you. Firstly, Brienne is just awesome. She\u2019s loyal practically to a fault, but that she takes her duties so seriously is part of her appeal. She was definitely the right choice to escort Jaime. And secondly, there\u2019s the Lannister lion himself. I had previously hated Jaime as is kind of normal with all the Lannisters bar Tyrion. His relationship with Cersei and what he did to Bran were just a recipe from dislike in my eyes. A Storm of Swords Part One will forever be marked as the beginning of my love affair with this man. As with the majority of Martin\u2019s characters, we\u2019re finally seeing the depth this character has to offer and he\u2019s melting my heart. Of course, his chapters also strengthen my dislike for Cersei, but otherwise they do a marvellous job of showing the better side of this \u2018evil\u2019 kingslayer. Daenerys\u2019 chapters are quite interesting in this book. I liked the whole Unsullied aspect of it and how she worked the people. I think she\u2019s becoming a better queen as time goes on, but a part of me still wonders if she\u2019s just as mad as Viserys. Hmm, time shall tell I suppose. Ser Jorah kind of ticks me off, and Dany needs to set him straight. Whenever he talks to her, I almost get secondhand frustration on her behalf. Though she\u2019s technically still a child, she\u2019s also a widow, rightful heir to the Iron Throne and the mother of three dragons. She does not need your constant whining, Mormont. Sort it out. Arstan is very puzzling too actually. He\u2019s rather clearly not exactly who he says he is, but I still haven\u2019t figured out just who he is and why he\u2019s there as of yet. I\u2019ll keep you posted. Lastly, we have Jon Snow; my favourite character in the entire series. His work with the wildings is especially fascinating because it introduces yet another completely different way of life in this series. Mance Rayder is nothing like I expected. I made the same mistake as Jon, and expected him to be the great big warrior-type, but no, he was rather a surprise. Ygritte makes me laugh with her constant chasing of Jon, but their relationship warms my heart, because Jon is so determined not to father any bastards in his life because he knows how hard it can be, but it\u2019s almost like he\u2019d forbidden himself from loving or caring about anyone ever just incase. I like that Ygritte changes that. I always try to avoid any real spoilers, but I must say that I was practically shouting at the book within the very last chapter. Bran and Jon being SO CLOSE to each other just drove me mad, because I just want all of the Starks to be happy forever. *Sad face*. I find these books hard to review because its hard to just pick what the main points are, what with there being so many! So, after all I have said (and I\u2019ve said rather a lot), I just really hope you can find the time to read this series. You will not regret it. ...more (review in english below) A fama desta saga \u00e9 bem merecida!

The reputation of this book series is well deserved! In spite of the huge amount of characters and the complexity of the story, with all the events that are taking place in the present and the numerous references to past events, the author leads us in a masterly way, to his own pleasure, from one end of Westeros to the other and inside the characters - as if we were wargs - taking us in one direction and then, unexpectedly, throwing us the other way. And we like it, and we want more! My favourite characters are still Tyrion, Jon Snow and Arya - their chapters always have a special feeling, in dialogues and emotions. I'm still watching the tv series, half way through the 2nd season, but I'm not sure if I'll continue, because it gets too confusing to watch a story which is essentially the same but starts to have too much aspects that are different from the books... ...more<---C>George R.R.
