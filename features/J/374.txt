I literally could not put it down, it didn't even occur to me. This book was fan-freakin-tastic and I definitely consider it among my few favorites. I already loved (and hated, in some cases) these characters. They already felt real to me. I know some people will read this series and say that some of the characters are without flaws, but I don't care. I followed Phedre and Joscelin into the most realized interpretation of Hell I have ever experienced. Seriously,<---M> as they were traveling there</---M>, I had chills and I was shivering. When they lived there, I felt so sick I could barely bear to keep reading. This particular version of Hell was just a distant country feared by everyone else, but I think it was supposed to represent a Hell on Earth, and it did. She went there because she knew her God, Elua, was calling her to...I dug the prophet vibe, and I got (yet again) chills when Carey described the feelings that came over Phedre when she realized what she had to do. Its so funny I know, that I found so much religious meaning in a book so full of strange gods. Anyway, absolutely brilliant end to this trilogy of the series. I ended it more than half in love with both Phedre and Joscelin, and I dare you to read them and not feel the same. ...more Although I did enjoy the first two books in this series, it was with a bucket of reservations: repetition, overblown language, and inadequate characterization of the supporting characters, which made the impressively plotted political machinations so much less involving. The third book, however, overturned most of these. There is still repetition (I will own, if I ever hear that phrase again I will go mad), but the high-flown language comes into its own describing the lengthy journey undertaken b Although I did enjoy the first two books in this series, it was with a bucket of reservations: repetition, overblown language, and inadequate characterization of the supporting characters, which made the impressively plotted political machinations so much less involving. The third book, however, overturned most of these. There is still repetition (I will own, if I ever hear that phrase again I will go mad), but the high-flown language comes into its own describing the lengthy journey undertaken by Phedre and co. The thinly veiled copy of our world almost seems like a whole new fantasy land. There is some dark unpleasantness in the middle of the book that felt like a step too far for me - significantly beyond what occurred in earlier books. I didn't like it, but it was somewhat redeemed when it proved to be integral to the plot. Above all, as other reviewers found, the more personal and philosophical nature of this book and the characters' motivations made it a much more enjoyable read. In particular, the development of the relationship between Imriel, Phedre and Joscelin was moving and genuine, and gave a satisfying conclusion to the series. ...more Carey writes very well. Her turns of phrase and choice of imagery are excellent. Her command of language is exquisite. She tells a deep and detailed story through well-imagined characters. I have found this true of all her books, and I can readily recommend them to anyone who can enjoy fantastical fiction. I don't want to spend too long on the whole series, but I haven't written an in-depth review of these books yet, so I'll quickly cover the highlights.

She tells a deep and detailed story through well-imagined characters. I have found this true of all her books, and I can readily recommend them to anyone who can enjoy fantastical fiction. I don't want to spend too long on the whole series, but I haven't written an in-depth review of these books yet, so I'll quickly cover the highlights. Carey's world is detailed and vibrant, with a rich theological backstory and a history just five degrees off the history with which we are familiar. Her main character is a spy, a sexual masochist, and a fate-stricken toy of the gods: all three aspects reinforce the others. As this setup may signify, the stories are rich in political intrigue, the prose is sensual bordering on luxuriant, and the scope of the books is epic. Occasionally, Carey's turns of phrase will reveal to me the wide-eyed fangirl behind the sophisticated writer, and I cherish those moments almost as much as the passages that leave me feeling awe. Occasionally, her editor lets a misspelling slip through -- usually one word where another was meant -- or a \"roleplayer's cliche\" slips out into the ordinarily inventive phrasing. In those moments, I feel I know Ms. Carey like an old friend. This book in particular is the culmination of Phedre's story, and it is a fitting swan song for our anguisette. The story ranges across the Middle East and Africa, offering looks at several cultures. The book comes to climax three times and rides each out gracefully into buildup for the next. Each climax is warranted, but having multiples is not entirely without cost. In some ways, this book feels slightly cramped. In certain scenes, the ordinarily sumptuous dialogue and in-depth characterization has been elided in favor of advancing the story. Here I'm thinking primarily of scenes at court in Egypt and Africa; much of the journey through Africa seemed to unfold more quickly than expected. Also, in previous volumes, we saw a great deal of Phedre's masochistic sexuality; in this volume, we dwell on how awkward it is for her a great deal, but we spend very little time exploring that aspect of her sexuality, and much more on her romantic life. Where previous volumes read like sensual or erotic fantasy, this volume definitely reads more like romantic fantasy. I don't begrudge Phedre her love, but it was a different kind of story. These observations aside, the story was epic and sweeping, the writing as elegant and well-tooled as ever, and the characters rich and fascinating. Carey's attention to theological detail and delicate touch with myth make this volume almost more philosophical intrigue than political, but no less enthralling for that. This volume caps off Phedre's story very nicely, a graceful glide into a warm loving glow. ...more Not quite a 5-star read but my favorite of the trilogy. The writing is nearly superb for most of the book, with so much meaning and depth packed into each sentence, and with every arc that began in the first book coming to a head, there's never a dull moment. It's pretty much edge-of-your-seat action for the last 500 pages. However, as much as I love this book, there's a good chunk--about 300 pages--I will never ever read again. Ever.

And how the thrust of the whole thing revolves around the love/hate of two extraordinary and powerful women. How often do you see that? Thing 2: The shape of the book is a bit . . . something. It can best be summarized as \u2018our heroine travels to an isolated place and frees the people there by being braver or smarter or specialer than they are.\u2019 This was pretty interesting when she was lifting the harem of a psychopath into revolt. A lot less interesting and a lot more eyebrow-raising when she starts doing it to other cultures. Thing 3: It\u2019s funny just how unengaging I found so much of this. Heroine is literally marked by a god to suffer, to be able to bear it so other people don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s a literalization of the implicit shape of a lot of epic fantasy, and of course a pretty good metaphor for the relationship of writer to character. You, my creation, carry this hurt, walk this dark path so I don\u2019t have to. Yeah, I\u2019ve written that. And I should like it, but I just . . . eh. Tepid.

That is how much I love Kushiel's Legacy. How do I describe my love for these books? Is it Ph\u00e8dre's courage, to falter at no boundaries in order to achieve what she believes in?

Or Joscelin's faith, to - putting it simply - protect and serve? Maybe it is that without a doubt, I would drop everything in a heartbeat to take up residence in Terre d'Ange and follow Blessed Elua. Whatever it is, these books make me think, they make me believe. I love them for it. Of course, these books are not without their flaws. Carey is a rambler; She goes off track more times than I ever bothered to count. She repeats the same thoughts over and over until you just want to scream, 'You know what? WE GET IT'. There are points in Ph\u00e8dre's journey where I could seriously fall asleep. I cannot stand her continual musings of Hyacinthe, and how she always ponders what would have happened between them, as though Joscelin could be so easily discarded. And yet... And yet at the end of the day, despite its flaws, it is a brilliant story, an epic journey across lands and seas to save a friend, a traitor's get, and a country fit for angels. <+++>Kushiel's Avatar</+++> is the darkest novel to date, pushing all characters beyond what they thought was their limit. Even Melisande, who we always believed indestructible, displays her one weakness: love for her son. And that's what these books are all about. At the centre of this book - no, of this legacy - lies one meaning, and one meaning only: Love. In all its forms, in all that it encompasses, nothing is greater or more profound. Love as thou wilt, is Blessed Elua's precept. Love for a friend, or a lover; a son, a country, a people, a patron. Love within light, and love within hate. It is all we need in the end, and maybe that is why I adore these books so much. For such a complex series, the legacy is so simple. On a completely unrelated (and very foreshadowing) note... fucking Carthage! I realised that whenever I turned to the map at the front of the book, seeing Carthage just made my blood boil. It freaking takes up 2/3s of the map! It was totally leering at me in all its ominousness hahaha. However, I cannot wait to get into Imriel's trilogy again. It's hard to stay away from these characters for too long; that is how much I love them. I miss them too much when they're not running amuck in my head. ...more I never say much about 6 star books.

And she reminds you of that in Every. Single. Page. That is my problem. I know that these things are parts of her character and her culture too, but while I used to be able to tolerate it, even if I never understood that, now I can't. It has become redundant, repetitive. I can't help but think that Kushiel's Dart was much better than this one is. Even book 2, for all its angst, was slightly better in my opinion, because Melisande stole the show. Plot wise I liked this conclusion. It brings this story arc to a fitting end, giving answers to the question that had been left unanswered, and the plot itself interwines with the subplots almost perfectly. When it comes to the structure of the book itself I have no complaints. And it helps that the characters have indeed grown and matured. Yet I struggled with Ph\u00e8dre's narration this time around, more than ever. Repeating things about her role and praising herself over and over: that was painful to read. And no, it did not bring me pleasure. I liked the romance, but I did not love it. That is probably due to the fact that I don't understand Ph\u00e8dre, I guess, I do not know. Hyacinthe made the choice for her in the end, otherwise what would have she done? I like Joscelin (who doesn't?) but sometimes his relationship with Ph\u00e8dre seemed a bit off to me. I loved the fact that they grew as a couple throughout the series, by learning to accept each other's flaws and personality, but I wish Carey didn't show us only that part, but the happier moments too. The fish scene was cute though, but Joscelin is always cute. Especially when he is shirtless in the middle of a muddy river. And Imriel, that little devil, was just amplifying his cuteness. But really, Ph\u00e8dre is one of my least favourite MCs ever. She's a well developed character, but, ugh, untolerable. It was easier to ignore when she was sorrounded by interesting characters, but in this book it became the big, pink elephant in the room. I'll try to read Imriel's trilogy. Not just because if I don't Lys will skin me alive of course. Imri is so cute. ...more How can a series with prose this purple and a premise this absurd be so gripping?

In this conclusion to the trilogy, Ph\u00e8dre seeks nothing less than the Name of God, which she needs to free her friend who was trapped on an island by an angry angel in the first book. She travels the world looking for it (a significant part of these books is travelogue, giving us a glance at Carey's intriguing alternate history) and along the way she undertakes to rescue the child of her greatest enemy. The section in the middle where she\u2019s imprisoned in the hellish harem is absolutely nauseating, and I\u2019m grateful the author skimmed over most of the details. The next trilogy focuses on the rescued child, Imriel, and I hope those books are as good as these first three. ...more \u03a3\u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2

For the first time in my life, I thought I was living in a book. A couple of times, I found myself not to continue reading because I was afraid of what will happen to the characters! I fell in love with them, fought beside them, cried for them, I lost hope as they did and, finally, I found my way like they did. I think that I walked the Lungo Drom with them. This book is not just another story of Phedre and her beloved Joscelin. And if you think that you\u2019ll read another adventure, you will be very surprised. It starts like one, but at the end you can see the greater purpose of this adventure. From the land of Terre d\u2019Ange and the great beauty, Phedre and Joscelin, ten years after the events of the second book are beginning a long journey. It all begins with the search of the name of the one true god in order to help Hyacinthe, Phedre\u2019s childhood friend who is cursed after the events of the first book. But soon, another quest in important. The child of Phedre\u2019s worst enemy and darkest passion is missing and in order to find him, they have to go the most cruel and mad place in their world. Phedre isn\u2019t anymore a young woman, new to the game of thrones. She has experience and she is clever. Her life the last ten years was very good. She has wealth but the most important is that the man who loves deeply against all odds, is with her and they have found a balance between them. I can\u2019t say that I don\u2019t understand that she had to make the most difficult decisions in this book and it wasn\u2019t easy for her, but sometimes it was hard to read it. In this story, Phedre make a journey to the darkest place in her world but it was also a journey to the darkest place in her soul. She found her limits and I don\u2019t think that she liked the answer. Joscelin found his limits too. He is one of my favorite male characters and it was too hard for to watch him suffer. Because, he suffered a lot. Loyal to his promise to protect and serve Phedre into damnation and beyond, he followed her in his worst nightmare. He watched her, doing things beyond his imagination but his love was always there. Because, although sometimes his actions are violent, he has pure soul and his love is undying. Sometimes I was thinking that he\u2019s a victim of Phedre, because she asks so much from him and he is giving her everything, but at the end of the book I realize that this is my mistake. Because, Josceline isn\u2019t her victim but her balance. Both of them, walked the Lungo Drom, not only for Hyacinthe but for themselves also. They found their limits, the fought their demons and at the end they found their truth. Another character that I absolutely loved in this book is Imriel. He is the son of Melisande, a traitor and an enemy to the crown. He didn\u2019t knew anything about his mother and he was living a nightmare until Phedre and Josceline saved him from a cruel fate. I don\u2019t want to say more about him because I won\u2019t avoid spoilers. He is clever and stubborn, but he is also loyal and kind. I can\u2019t wait to read more about him! Of course, many more characters were important in this book both old and new ones, but I won\u2019t write for all because it will be a huge review! You just have to know that this is an amazing book and I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m reading this series! ...more Ten years have passed in Terre d'Ange, peace and prosperity for the country, and for Phedre and Joscelin. Phedre has never forgotten Hyacinche, still trapped by the curse of the angel Rahab, and has long searched for (and never found) the one thing which could free him - the name of god. Then comes a request for help from Melisand Sharizhai, her son Imriel, hidden away in secret these ten years is now missing, presumed abducted.

Phedre has never forgotten Hyacinche, still trapped by the curse of the angel Rahab, and has long searched for (and never found) the one thing which could free him - the name of god. Then comes a request for help from Melisand Sharizhai, her son Imriel, hidden away in secret these ten years is now missing, presumed abducted. And if Phedre will search for him, Melisande promises a lead on the lost tribe of the yeshuites, and perhaps the name of god. Phedre's third and final adventure, is bigger, scarier, more dangerous, and much more exciting than the last. I couldn't have believed that Jacqueline Carey knew how to better the last book, but she did. I was glad to see that Phedre and Joscelin's relationship has solidified somewhat, I guess 10 years without mishap worked well for them. But it's still amazing, the trial that happen to their relationship. When phedre gets involved in something because she must, because Kushiel wills it, and Joscelin stands by her no matter what, no matter what danger she puts herself in, he has to watch her do it, and be there to protect her.. I still think this has to be the most heroic and romantic partnership in the history of fantasy fiction. I don't think I've read better or cried more for a long time. The lore and history of the books is still brilliant also, the storyline roughly follows the legend of the lost tribes of israel (jewish lore), but as I know barely anything about that in real terms, I couldn't say anything about how the story was used, or how close to 'realistic' it was, I don't even know much of the relative countries in modern terms... But I can say that it was amazingly well written. Especially exciting is the rare instances of 'magic' or visions and such that occur, the majority of the style is more historical fiction style than fantasy, so when the magic creeps in, melded subtly in, you almost don't see it coming, but it makes some amazing scenes. I would guess that anyone reading this review has probably already read the first two books, but if you haven't, you really should, because this trilogy only gets better and better. And they're huge long books but so well worth the reading time. I lost my 7% lead on my book challenge while reading these, but I don't regret it.

It is there that the Mahrkagir teaches her not only the depths to which an anguisette can plummet, but what a \"boy with a dog\" can become with enough blunt psychological trauma. It is also there that Ph\u00e8dre and the abused Imriel (Melisande's son and the object of Ph\u00e8dre's harrowing quest) befriend one another. The wounds sustained in Dar\u0161anga heal clean, as always, but Ph\u00e8dre's road back to Joscelin necessitates healing of a different kind. Their reunion scene, after Joscelin has caught the fish, is tender and sensual and beautiful--easily my favorite of the series. The conclusion to this first trilogy also features the rescue of Ph\u00e8dre's childhood friend, Hyacinthe. Once he has escaped the Master of the Straits curse, he plans to begin a life with Sibeal--but not without acknowledging that she will always be second in his heart to Ph\u00e8dre. This was an exceptionally well-executed triangle, as I felt the bittersweet sting of their goodbye scenes despite rooting for the Joscelin/Ph\u00e8dre romance. Honestly, I probably would have been happy if she had ended up with either one. Imriel becoming Ph\u00e8dre's foster son was certainly a poetic turn of events, given her past with Melisande and her vow never to have children (for fear of producing another anguisette). Though this ending hardly came as a surprise, part of me feared that Ysandre would step in and claim custody of Melisande's son, leaving Ph\u00e8dre with yet another loss to mourn. (For reasons unknown even to me, I never quite liked Queen Ysandre.) This last installment of the trilogy spends sufficient time establishing Imriel's character and planting the seeds for decades of future conflict. Probably a good thing, since the second Kushiel trilogy is the \"Imriel trilogy\"! ...more The conclusion to Jacqueline Carey\u2019s Kushiel trilogy featuring Phedre no Delaunay leads us to Phedre\u2019s darkest hour.

If she refuses the quest, she may lose the favours of her gods. Her trials do not end at finding the boy. It is merely a painful step in her ultimate goal, to free her childhood friend, Hyacinthe. Accompanying and watching her suffer through the sadistic tortures is her loyal and loving warrior-priest, Joscelin. This book truly demonstrates Elua\u2019s sacred concept, \u201cLove as thou wilt\u201d. J. Carey\u2019s provocative writing lures me to read and reread her books. The fantastic multifaceted and culturally enriched world she creates is a feast for the starving. In a time where most authors provide a \u201cfast food story\u201d, Carey caters for a 12 course gourmet meal. Each scene is designed to interlock and enhance a plot further along in her story. Her main characters are endearing, neither completely evil nor good. For each Evil person, she redeems them with acts of kindness. For each Good person, when an unspeakable act is committed, motives are explained in such a way that forces the reader to empathize. J. Carey is a true artist who paints exquisite scenery and erotic situations. The interactions between Phedre, Joscelin, Imirel and Melisandre invoke strong passionate emotions. Several of her sex scenes build and stroke desires to a feverous peak before it explodes in a fiery climax. In the Kushiel Trilogy, she built an entire civilization which embodies the BDSM society openly. Her anguissette portrays the ultimate submissive BDSM persona. Definitely not for the bland or timid; no sexual limit is taboo in this book. I eagerly wait for her next trilogy into the world of Terre d\u2019Ange. ...more This series took me by surprise and became a favorite.

Now for the reason this almost didn't get a five star rating. I liked Phedre throughout the series but I felt that here in the last instead of growing older and wiser she became even more selfish and unlikable. Every choice is her's to make and every destiny is her fate. In the first book being a anguissette is a calling. A service to both her god and her patrons. There's a sense of sacrifice like in a religious calling. But here at the end it seems more of a \"I want\" and is more about herself. And did the ever sufferingly loyal Joscelin ever come first for her? Hyacinthe and Melisande always rated higher. She would have even left Imriel in the end if Hyacinthe would have had her. Also the \"big baddie\" came out of nowhere and didn't fit within the trilogy. And the last chapters, which were very important to the entire Phedre story seemed tacked on. But actually in some ways I liked this book better than Choice. I liked the return of characters from the first. And I really liked the character Imriel. My favorite scenes were between Phedre, Joscelin and him. A good book. A great series. And I look forward to reading more. ...more I wrote the following review for my Kindle copy of this book.

I have gone full days not wanting to put the book down to go and get a meal or snack. I even go thirsty forgetting that I need to drink water. And getting to sleep while in the middle of one of her stories takes more discipline than I have. Even after I move to my 'go to sleep' book and I finally crash, I dream these stories. I have shelved these books in erotic but there is so little erotic and it is well a part of who the main character and about her worship of her gods.

The trilogy has its flaws, I'll admit. For one thing, pages on pages could have been cut in the interests of getting to the point faster and dazzling prose. Still, for me, I quite enjoyed the leisurely pace in some parts of it, and the careful and detailed world building that ensued. Yes, it's kind of ridiculous the way what is essentially France is idolised, and the idea of a land where everyone is beautiful seems like a bit of blatant wish-fulfilment, and the heroine is unlikely and, yes, maybe a little too perfect and prepared for whatever comes. And there's the sex -- plenty of it in each and every book, and some of it rather more kinky than your average person is interested in reading about. Oh, and there's what other people would probably consider to be blasphemy, too. But accept all of that -- and it isn't as hard as it may sound, I think, as long as you have the mental power to skip parts you know you're not going to like -- and there's a brilliant story shining out at you. Or so it seems to me! I do understand why some people don't like it. Now that I've articulated that, I'm going to get back to adoring it, though. This final book was not quite so much about politics, I think. I mean, that was there -- couldn't really not be, considering. But this book was more about love, what with the various subplots finally playing out: Hyacinthe, Melisande's son, what Kushiel wants of Ph\u00e8dre, etc, etc. A lot of the things in this book were connected to love, which is appropriate to the world it's set in, really, given that the central precept of the religion is \"love as thou wilt\". The thing that most excited me about this book was the quest for the secret name. I loved the character of Hyacinthe from the start, and was sad when he barely appeared in the second book, so I was very glad at how much of the book was dedicated to this quest. At first it seemed a bit backward, since the overthrow of Drujan would seem to be more dramatic and yet came long before the climax of the book, but the way it played out was very good. I was pleased at the way the breaking of the geis was handled, and Hyacinthe's return to life. It would have seemed too good to be true if he'd just got back what he had before he became Master of the Straits. Imriel's subplot was interesting, too. It was good to see a more tender side of Melisande, the love for her son, and was interesting to get to know Imriel -- how different he turns out. I didn't care for that plot very much at first, but it grew on me a lot, until I cheered at the relationship between him, Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin. Joscelin is, by far, my favourite character of these books. It has to do with his absolute loyalty, which is one of those things I find very appealing in a character. It was very very hard to read how he was tested in Drujan, but it was well-written. I love the peace he and Ph\u00e8dre make with it all: it's appropriate, and good to see them finding a balance. All in all, I really wish I had the Imriel trilogy right now. Unfortunately, unless someone loves me very much and buys me the hardbacks, I'm going to have to wait until all three books are out in paperback in the UK. I'm sure it'll be worth the wait. ...more This is and always will be my favourite out of the entire Kushiel's Legacy series - I haven't even read all of the books yet and I can already say without a doubt that this one is my favourite - that should tell you a lot about how much I love it, especially if you've heard me rave about previous books in the series.

Here's the story; Phedre and her wonderful lover Joscelin, after having been given ten years of peace by fate, are once again swept up in the current of Carey; that mix of destiny and intrigue and a hint of random occurence that makes for such a great story. They set out to find Imriel, the lost son of Melisande Shahrizai, traitor to the crown. What I love about this novel in particular, among all of them, is that in this one Phedre (the main character) feels more mature - and more herself. In the first two, she was always doing other people's work, finding out their secrets, trying to save their countries - noble, but not particularly fulfilling. Kushiel's Avatar starts out that way, but halfway through the novel Phedre grows a little more rebellious; it's like she starts fighting for herself for once, instead of being swept along by the current and making the best of it. She fights - makes some life-altering decisions, some terrible, terrible sacrifices, but there is a lovely message of hope in the book in that no matter how much she, Joscelin and Imriel suffer in captivity (because they are once again captured, in an even worse way than before), there is a streak of hope that runs through the entire thing. Like, in captivity, Phedre somehow convinces her fellow prisoner to help her break a way into a closed off courtyard where they can finally see the sun again after months of darkness, both physical and emotional darkness; and as that happens, you can just feel this incredible vibe of human strength course through the people present. Also, in this book, Carey takes that everything-is-connected-ness, that humanity-in-her-characters-ness, that my-novels-are-speckled-with-little-moments-and-sentences-so-profound-they-will-leave-you-reeling-ness that is her own and takes it to a whole nother level. In short - fantastic novel, everyone who is even remotely into fantasy should read it. And even those that aren't. It might change your life. ...more When I started reading this series, I could never have imagined how much I would end up loving it. I'm a bit sad it's over.

I would really have liked to get Joscelin's point of view at some points though. I bet it's interesting inside his head. The gods of Terre d'Ange can be real bastards though. Blackmail?! Couldn't they just kinda make her understand subtly that if they didn't do to Darsanga, the fate of the known world could be at stake, instead of just basically going: yeah, me and my buddies Kushiel and Namaah are just going to desert you unless you go through the worst hell you could ever imagine if you don't go looking for your worst enemy's kid at the end of the world, okay? Totally your choice though. Things: - reading this book while being a bit feverish with a bad cold led me to vividly hallucinate about Kushiel. That was interesting. I'll leave it to you to interprete what that says about my brain. - Never trust a woman named Melisand(r)e. - I'll from now on frequently refer to myself as D'Angeline to explain things, as, I think, if that world was real, where I live would be part of it. ;) - I don't think they're supposed to have peppers and eukalyptus trees... - What about the New World? I wonder if this and Aliette De Bodard's Obsidian and Blood could be set in the same world? I'm not quite sure if I should get the next trilogy. People in general seem to like it, but I just can't imagine that another narrator would come close to Ph\u00e8dre. Sigh...love hurts, and every farewell doubly so... ...more Five well earned stars.

I don't think I could not. \"I had killed a man, murdered his trust, taken his life. If I had to do it again, I would. I believe that. Still, I could not forget. Should not forget.\" Kushiel's Avatar dips its characters into the depths of hell. There is hardly a character who emerges unscathed, physically or emotionally. The cruelty and brutality seem overwhelming. Ph\u00e8dre herself questions Kushiel. Surely, somethings are too much to bear. But there's also unimaginable joy, hope, and love. Positivity and beauty practically radiate from the pages. There's a future. By the end, I was crying happy tears. I have nitpicks. The endless traveling was a bit repetitive and exhausting after a while. It definitely needed more Favrielle and her sass. But what is comes down to is that I don't want to criticize this.

And, sure, that\u2019s a backdrop and perhaps the \u201cpurpose\u201d of a lot of it, but I\u2019d say Elua and his companions would tell you this book is about somewhat else. The book is about saving Imriel, the son of ye olde arch nemesis, Melisande. Why this book? Because I love Joscelin. Der. How\u2019d it go? Birth Control Well, let\u2019s start with an excerpt from my review of the previous installment of this series: One thing I forgot to mention in my review of the previous book was the lack of pregnancy. I mean, Ph\u00e8dre don\u2019t do nuthin\u2019 about birth control. I was going to go into that in this review, but by the time I started it, I\u2019d read the first couple of chapters of the third book and there\u2019s a maybe-sorta hint of an explanation for that. It\u2019s going to have to be better than that to satisfy me, but I\u2019m going to give it until I finish that book before I complain about it. (I say \u201ccomplain\u201d because even if it is a good explanation, I\u2019m going to complain that it took until then to even hint at it.) Ph\u00e8dre says something about how she never \u201copened her womb to Namaah\u201d near the beginning of this book. I thought maybe that was it, but upon further reading, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s just a pretty way of saying she didn\u2019t plan on getting knocked up. At this point, I\u2019ve read onward into the next trilogy of this series, which is told from the point-of-view of a character who is introduced in this novel. And his story has given me more to ponder on the matter with these promiscuous Terre d\u2019Angers. Heh. In one place, there\u2019s talk of \u201clighting a candle to Eisheth\u201d in order to conceive. No guarantees in that working, apparently, but otherwise, it would seem they don\u2019t have to worry about unwanted pregnancy. I have problems with this. For one, it made me have to go back and reread the first book because I was certain Ph\u00e8dre was an unwanted pregnancy. But, as it turns out, she wasn\u2019t. She was just unwanted once she was born, being \u201cflawed\u201d and all. Which brings me to something else. Her mom was pregnant when they sold Ph\u00e8dre at four, so Ph\u00e8dre has a little brother or sister out there somewhere. I\u2019d really like to know who and where. Anyway, back to this Eisheth thing. It\u2019s actually in the second book of the next trilogy where I got it, this lack of unwanted pregnancy thing and all because a non-Terre d\u2019Ange character says to the main character, in regards to such things, \u201cWe\u2019re not like you.\u201d Which is funny to me, because the men have no control over it. It\u2019s all about the woman \u201clighting a candle to Eisheth.\u201d I know this, because one makes a joke about doing so to the main character of that next trilogy. Eisheth is the Elua companion who was all about music and art and such things. But, you know, I\u2019m just realizing, that \u201clighting a candle to Eisheth\u201d bit is said by a native of what was Eisheth\u2019s land. Maybe it\u2019s different for each of them, \u201copening her womb to Namaah\u201d being what Servants of Namaah do. Ohhh. Yeah. That\u2019s got to be it. Still, I want to know what it means, dammit. And I don\u2019t understand why there\u2019s not some explanation of it, say, in the very first book. Maybe I\u2019m a little obsessed with birth control. Everything Else Holy crap. Okay. So the second book picked up within moments of the end of the first. This one picks up ten years after the end of the second book, which is cool. It means that Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin, ah Joscelin, have had ten years of peace and happiness. With Ph\u00e8dre \u201conly\u201d taking a patron once every year or so, to subdue the pricking of Kushiel\u2019s Dart. Ahem. Melisande is still bound to a temple in a foreign country. Sanctuary. Leaving means facing up to treason and a death sentence. When her son is kidnapped from the quiet little Temple of Elua where she had him hid, Melisande calls on Ph\u00e8dre to find out why, who, and where he is. And rescue him. And boy, does that send Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin all over the damn map. What\u2019s great is, we all assume someone found out who Imriel was -- that he was a Prince of the Blood, third in line for the throne of Terre d\u2019Ange, and conspired to make sure the son of a pair of traitors stood no chance of ever gaining that throne. (First and second in line for it are the queen\u2019s daughters, gotten by the Cruarch of Alba, and man does that come into play in later books.) Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin track the whole mess to the southern coast and beyond, finally (and through some awesome cultural weirdness) to a faraway land that has fallen into darkness, Drujan. No one expects them to go into this hell on earth for Melisande\u2019s son. Even I-love-to-do-anything-that-makes-Joscelin-sorry-he-loves-me Ph\u00e8dre decides not to do it. Damn fine time for Elua to give her a moment of enlightenment and hoobie-joobie that tells her she has to do it. The Mahrkagir of this hellish place lives by a motto of pain and atrocity. Guess who\u2019s got Imriel? I\u2019m proud of Ph\u00e8dre for begging the gods not to make her go, at least a little bit. But, of course, she goes, and Joscelin with her. I understand why, so it really breaks my heart in the best possible way. Imriel says, in his trilogy, that he believes Dars\u0103nga was hardest on Joscelin, and I believe it. I don\u2019t care if Joscelin is technically anathema to the Casseline order, Joscelin is Casseil. That was the angel who followed Elua and believed himself damned for doing so, but believed God had gone against His own edicts by turning his back on Elua. Following Elua was a practice in \u201cLove as though wilt\u201d for the other companions, but not for Casseil. He protected Elua, and he went with him out of the love he felt God denied Elua, but I would imagine it was tortuous. I\u2019d challenge Casseil to say his road was harder than Joscelin\u2019s, though. Good lord. Dars\u0103nga, the capital city of Drujan, is horrible. And so heartbreakingly well written. As for myself, I\u2019d rather to go hell. I believe most in that place would choose hell over it as well. Reminds me of that line in that Chronicles of Riddick film: \"If I owned this place and Hell, I'd rent this place out, and live in Hell.\" Joscelin gets to be one of the Mahrkagir\u2019s warriors and gets to know the wretched things that are going on without being able to do anything about it. He gets to know he came here to this dark and horrible place and put the woman he loves into the hands of this black hole of a human being. And \u201chuman being\u201d is a hard word to type in this case, but I\u2019m glad to remind myself that human beings are monsters. And angels. Right. I\u2019m reviewing a book. Hold on. Let\u2019s catch our breath. Okay, go. Imriel is also in this place, of course, along with probably my favorite cast Ph\u00e8dre ever gets involved with. They\u2019re from every land, far and near, and it gives such great scope to Carey\u2019s world. The horrific conditions of their existence make the pinpricks of hope blinding. Think of me what you will, but it is my favorite sort of tale to get involved with. Notice how I\u2019m not going into detail, however. There's no way I could do it justice, no way I could convey all that section of the book made me feel. Then it's time for Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin to trek to a whole new land, even further away, into what we would call Africa. There, they will find a forgotten culture that holds an ark that contains the Name of God. The Name of God is what we need to free Hyacinthe. At this point, Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s not really okay. Dars\u0103nga finally gave her something beyond what Kushiel\u2019s Dart pushes her toward -- that whole getting pleasure out of pain. Or, rather, seeking pain for the pleasure of it. With one of the other prisoners of Dars\u0103nga as a guide, and the help of some cool characters along the say, they make it down to that faraway place, and manage to do some healing on the way. All three of them. Again, not going into detail, but for a brighter, mirrored reason as the reasoning behind not going into detail on Dars\u0103nga. Now, the people who have the Name of God are a story in their own right. They kill all the good guys and the book ends. Kidding. Now, was I ever so ready to see Ph\u00e8dre have to finally put it all out there and choose. You remember me complaining about this, right? That she never really had to make a choice between Joscelin and Hyacinthe. I wasn\u2019t looking to \u201cstick it to\u201d Hyacinthe, but after all Joscelin goes through for her, and she was still saying she didn\u2019t know what the relationship between her and Hyacinthe would be when he was freed, I was this big ball of frustration, fury, and hope. I may have yelled a few obscenities. It\u2019s what I do. Now, I don\u2019t want to make it sound as if I don\u2019t like Hyacinthe. I do. I like him very much. He\u2019s just not the \u201cright one.\u201d The thing is, I\u2019m pretty sure he knows it. One thing I do enjoy is the relationship between Joscelin and Hyacinthe, and the way Joscelin talks about Hyacinthe as the \u201cdamn Tsingano\u201d with no hate. Perhaps a bit of rue. And lordy God, does Carey ever love the words \u201crue\u201d and \u201cwry.\u201d I think, in reading these books, I\u2019ve gone over my brain\u2019s allotment of being able to read those two words. Never again will I see either of those words and not think of these books. So, the one thing I most wanted to see never happened: Ph\u00e8dre never once had to betray an oath for Joscelin\u2019s sake. But you know what? I think I\u2019m okay with it. Because it truly does make Joscelin the Casseiliest of Cassiline Brothers, even through (and because of) the fact that they kicked him out for following Ph\u00e8dre. Reading onward to Imriel\u2019s trilogy? I think I already gave that one away. I\u2019ve read the first two. As soon as I\u2019m able to get my hands on the third, I\u2019ll read it. Part of it was because I liked the kid, but it was even more because Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin adopt him and I just had to see them as parents. And another thing. I\u2019ve been itching to talk about it. That \u201cLove as thou wilt\u201d motto. I wonder if it\u2019s on purpose, that \u201cwilt.\u201d I mean, the thirteen houses of Namaah\u2019s servants are all named for flowers. Night-blooming flowers, but that\u2019s neither here nor there. The point is, they\u2019re named for flowers and their servants, along with all the people of the belief, believe in the edict to love as though wilt . Maybe Elua didn\u2019t meant to love as you damn well please. Wouldn\u2019t that be cool? ...more", "Title": "Kushiel's Avatar"},
