Laurel's head jerked back. 'Really?' 'Sure. Sanzang, Scheherazade, Guinevere. And then there was that disgraceful incident with Eve.'\" Several paragraph's later, at the end of the scene on page 103, Laural \"look[s:] over at Katya, one eyebrow raised. 'Eve? Seriously?' \"Of course. Why? What do the humans say about her?'\" And that's the only information we're given. I'm sorry, you can't just change such a significant person as Eve and make her a faery without offering any explanation! Yet, that's what she does. And the book only gets worse from there. (Don't even get me started on what she does to Shakespeare!) Honestly, the people who have given this book high ratings have either a) never read any faery books before in their lives, or b) have never read a well-written book. I didn't think it was possible for the writing to get worse, but I was wrong. There is very little interaction with the trolls-- the series bad guys-- in the book, so most of Pike's time is spent explaining her faery world and having Laurel fluctuate between David and Tamani. I thought I would stab my eyes out if I had to read yet another scene of David and Laurel making out. I mean, honestly! And the scenes where Laurel is in Avalon are also ridiculous: why not show us how the potions work with some examples of them saving lives, rather than telling us how they work? You know the whole, \"show don't tell\" mantra? It really works! I thought the whole faery social structure was somewhat interesting, but ridiculous. And the scene with the warrior woman who chases after trolls was beyond stupid. Why bring her in? Hopefully, for those who continue with the series, she'll be explained a bit more. Her explanation of faery language and it's connection to English was laughable. Do your research woman! There are faeries or fae-like creatures in nearly every culture of the world, so it stands to reason that faeries would know nearly every language in those cultures in which they feature. Granted, the majority of what we know and think of about faeries is Western European, but there are African faery-like creatures, as well as Asian. Also, why Gaelic? Why bring in Irish mythology at all? And why not tell me what the Unseelie Court means in your world? I highly doubt that all of her readers even know what that is, or why its so significant to faery mythology in general. This was overwrought, boring and insipid. There are much better books out there with much better mythologies. I honestly think Pike just sat down and started writing without planing out her mythology at all. You would think with such stellar examples as Tolkien and Rowling, one would know that if you're going to invent a whole new mythology, you should work out as many kinks as you can. And if you're going to reinvent famous people, at least do your reader the courtesy of a thorough and clear explanation! ...more I picked up this book simply because I wanted to know what happened to these Mary Sues. I had no interest in the plot. I had no interest in the story itself. And because I would enjoy a good laugh. I didn't. This was so bad that it didn't even let me laugh at its stupidity. It was that stupid. First of all, Pike's writing is exactly like Meyer's. They both describe the most irrelevant things. They both have an adjective for every noun on each freaking page. It bothers me to complete death. Secon I picked up this book simply because I wanted to know what happened to these Mary Sues. I had no interest in the plot. I had no interest in the story itself.

She claims she's \"just friends\" with him when they clearly HOLD HANDS and have so much sexual tension. It's so stupid. She's just like Bella. She's a moron who doesn't know what the hell she wants.

This was a great novel from Aprilynne Pike. I really enjoyed the building of characters and the glimpse into the life of Laurel before she was \"human\". The world of faerie according to Aprilynne is fascinating, and she really gets me thinking about how Laurel's character might change the faerie world some day. Now, I really like David. He is an acceptional teenage human boy, who truely loves Laurel. But, in all human and other creature relationships, its not going to be perfect forever. Laurel is not going to age for sometime and it will start to be noticeable as David does. She is going to stay a faerie and David will age. I like their relationship but I am a bigger fan of Tamani and Laurel. Who wouldn't be? Tamani has made sacrifices all his life for his true love, even when she can't remember how it used to be. Tamani would never give up on her no matter what, even when he knows how Laurel feels about David. David was willing to serender, but Tamani will never falter. I think Laurel is just afraid of giving into her Faerie life, truthfully. \"Tell me,\" he said, his voice sharp and demanding. \"Tell me David is all you need or want in your life.\" His face was close to her, his soft breath caressing her face. \"That you never think of me when you're kissing him. That you don't dream about me the way I dream about you. Tell me you don't love me. \" -Tamani My heart melted like a popsicle, when I read this. What true love it must be to have the passion he does. I like the excitement that this book held, the twists and the drama. I am excited to find out who and what Klea's character will hold.

Although she completely accepts who and what she is, she refuses to turn her back on the life that she has always known, her life with human parents and friends. This is causing a few problems in Avalon as Laurel really needs to learn what it means to be a real faerie and Tamani begins to show his true feelings. After spending the whole summer relearning her magic in Avalon, Laurel knows she cannot hide her feelings for Tamani but actually choosing between him and David could mean losing one of them for good. Laurel also knew that the troll problem wasn't completely gone but she thought that she and David were being protected. Her magic hasn't been going very well so far but it could save both the human and faerie world if she can finally get something right. As I said in my review of Wings, I couldn't wait to start on this book and I ended up reading it in one sitting. The story was both interesting and exciting at different times which was helped by the mix of settings throughout. I really liked the fact that the book is pretty much split in two. The first half seems to be more about knowledge and explanations while the second half is all about adventure and excitement. I know this could seem like there is just a slow build up but there was enough going on for me to stay interested. With Laurel heading off to Avalon for the summer, we get to find out a lot more about her relationship with Tamani and what happened between them before they erased Laurel's memory. I loved hearing about their past, meeting Tamani's family which gave me a bigger insight into his character and also what the other faeries thought about the relationship. I was hoping for some of this in Wings but I'm glad it was saved for this book as it was possible for certain things to be explored more thoroughly. The time in Avalon was lovely to read about as Pike's descriptions were magical in themselves. I truly felt like I was walking through the different areas and could understand the faerie hierarchy better because of this. It is stated in Wings that Laurel was sent to live with humans for a reason but it is never specified and the same goes for this book. It's obvious that she is a whole lot more important than anyone is letting on which is easily seen by how others act around her or look at her when she is in Avalon. I'm hoping that this part of the story is cleared up in book 3 instead of making readers wait until the very last instalment to find out what is really going on. In both Wings and <+++>Spells</+++>, I felt that the chemistry between Laurel and David was lacking but this wasn't the case with her and Tamani. While Laurel is unsure about who she should be with, it is clear to me that she is extremely drawn to Tamani and nothing seems to get rid of the feelings she has for him. The small amount of time that they actually spend together proves that there is so much chemistry and could be passion between the two. I'm personally routing for Tamani to get the girl. The very last chapter sees Laurel finally making a choice between David and Tamani and for me, the most exciting in the whole book. The way the story was left made me want more immediately because I am dying to know what happens next. Just when I though things were finalised, the very last paragraph changed everything. Luckily, there are going to be a total of 4 books in this series and I know I will be buying #3 as soon as it is released. All of the main characters really come into their own in <+++>Spells</+++>. I hate to see characters left with hardly any development but everyone changed enough to convince me that they were real, with the events of both books taking a toll on their lives. It seems as though every little thing was taken into account when writing these characters, not leaving any stone unturned when it came to what they were feeling about everything. Not only does this book explore the relationships between Laurel, David and Tamani but also her relationship with her parents. I felt like these parts of the book were written so well that I could believe in what was going on. Laurel's mother and father have different views on their daughter being a faerie and I can see both of their reasons being realistic. It would be only natural to act differently, in both good and bad ways, towards someone you have known for years when they suddenly change. I loved Wings but I loved Spells even more. There was enough of different aspects in the story to keep it entertaining with a mixture of paces and it made me feel for the characters so much more than the first book. I'm dying to know when book 3 is going to be released. It will be one of my most highly anticipated releases. ...more Hi.

But they probably don\u2019t cry saltwater, because saltwater is icky on my plant pores and saps my strength. Anyway, I\u2019ve just spent my summer at the faerie Academy, where of course I couldn\u2019t do anything right for no specified reason. It makes me cry! I\u2019m probably too human, but that\u2019s okay, because I\u2019m really a faerie, remember. Faeries are totally awesome because despite being plants they are graceful and in school everyone pays attention all the time and no one gets laughed at when they fail. Did I mention faeries are totally superior to humans? Because they are. Anyway I went to the Academy to learn how to protect my adopted family from the trolls that are bound to attack me because I\u2019m just that special. But even though I learnt a lot and then some other irrelevant stuff happened, al that I really remember is dating two boys \u2013 one a human and the other the hottest fairy EVER OMG did I mention I have two boyfriends? I should cry about this. In the end, I didn\u2019t even manage to protect my loved ones and needed rescuing AGAIN! Sigh. What\u2019s a perfect flower girl to do?

Spells begins a number of months after the events of Wings . The time has come for Laurel to depart from her \"normal\" life to the academy in Avalon, where she will be taught what it means to be a Fall faerie. Laurel struggles with learning all of the things she missed and has forgotten while \"posing\" as a human. She isn't sure what to make of just about any of her peers at the academy. Some seemed to have missed her, others seem to wish she wouldn't have come back, while others seem to be indifferent altogether. She also learns that in faerie hierarchy, Spring fae like her friend/ more than friend Tamani are treated as no more than servants - and she does not like standing by quietly while it happens. While Laurel is in Avalon, she and Tamani grow closer than ever and when it's time to go back home to David, she becomes confused. I have to say that I hated Laurel at some parts in this book. She treats Tamani pretty badly and I just wanted to reach my foot into the book and give her a swift kick in the derri\u00e8re. As far as the love triangle goes, I truly hope she ends up with Tamani. David is nice and all, but his character is boring and doesn't have much development. :( After trying to balance her two worlds, human and faerie; Laurel fails miserably. After lying to both David and Tamani, she just may end up losing it all. Then... all the while Laurel is having problems with her love life and trying to hone her Fall abilities, the trolls are causing trouble again. BIG TROUBLE. A couple new plot twists are introduced in this book as well. It should make for an interesting third installment! - - - The pace of this book was nice. A little slow to start, but not really a big deal for me. I knew the goods were coming! I feel like I am the minority here, but I enjoyed this book oodles more than Wings ! Spells just had so much magic... and being able to follow Laurel and Tamani around Avalon was my favorite part. Pike painted a magnificent picture! Amazing imagery. I honestly could read about Avalon all day . ^-^ For me, this was a wonderful follow-up and I am planning to read Illusions sometime in the next week. ...more Why can't I stop screaming and crying?!

I never read a book before where there were ranks between the different faerie types. - So much more romantic tension! It was so damn frustrating! I mean, I loved it and everything, but GAH. As cheesy as it sounds, for Laurel it's not just about choosing the right guy. It's also about which world she chooses to belong to since she can't have both. She can't just pick one guy and live in the other guys world. This is one of those love triangles that make me want to scream. I really, REALLY want Laurel to be with Tamani but...ugh, it's too complicated. I don't even want to think about it anymore. I have no clue what will happen to these three but I just hope it's something good. Because I am very close to just jumping in the story and handcuffing Tamani and Laurel together. The Bad - N/A The In-Betweens - Like the first book, I found a majority of it a bit slow paced. But it wasn't a big issue. The Characters - I'm really proud of Laurel for making such tough, but sensible, decisions. Yeah, she did lie sometimes, which I didn't think was a good idea, but she had good intentions. I think she should've been a little easier on Tamani, but that's mostly my fangirl side speaking. - I really don't get David. Sometimes he's the typical science nerd, other times a total romantic who sets up picnics for his girlfriend. Once I even thought that maybe he was under the influence of the trolls to get Laurel into a trap. But I guess David is just an unpredictable character, which I like. - And now, Tamani. My lovely Tamani. WHY MUST HE HAVE TO GO THROUGH SO MUCH?! It's not fair! Let the guy have a break! I was so mad at Laurel for what she did to him at the end. (view spoiler) [Saying no to Tamani and telling him to go away?! It's like abandoning a cute stray kitty. HOW can you say that to someone so precious? (hide spoiler) ] And from what Tamani said at the ending, I have a weird feeling for what he's about to do. I just...I wanna...hug him. And never let go. Come here, Tamani. *holds out arms* Recommended? - I think this book was better than the first one, so yes, I recommend you continue on the series with this book. You learn a lot more about the faeries, their rules and their world. Off to Illusions I go! =D ...more Deel 2 in de Wings serie. Een boek met goede kanten, maar zeker wat minpunten.

David will age and die while watching her stay the same. Also, she will always have to hide what she is and what she loves. I liked her more when she was in Avalon with Tamani. Summary - Which I will definitely need since Pike publishes a story per year The story opens with Laurel have been requested to attend Academy in Avalon since her skills are so lacking. Tamani takes her through the gate, but has to stay since that is his station. Jamison, Winter Fae who is of the upperclass elite, takes her to the academy. Once there, everyone knows her while she doesn't have a single memory of them (her memory was erased so that she could blend in the human world). Laurel's head professor forces her spend a week reading herbology basics. When she gets a break, Tamani takes her throughout Avalon. First, we notice that Tamani cannot embrace her but has to bow. This is where Pike introduces her societal structure of Fae classes. Spring Fae are the working class who take care of the other classes. The are truly at the bottom of the food chain and supposedly don't mind. Next, they go into the Summer Market. The Summer Fae are the entertainers who are flashy. They make baubles for Fall and Winter fae who do not have to pay for anything. Tamani then takes her to his side of town and his family home. We meet his mother, Rhoslyn, and niece, Rowan. Rhoslyn was a kind of faerie midwife taking care of the saplings who are the young of Avalon. At this point, Laurel learns that she has parents but the records were burned. Fall Fae are not allowed to stay with the other Fae, they attend academy. Laurel is fed up with the class structure and wants to walk with Tamani and be his equal. He is fine with how things are. He also tells her that he cannot choose to be with her because of his station. She must choose to be his. He plans on waiting forever for her. THIS MADE ME WANT TO SCREAM! Laurel continues her studies. Two characters at school may become more important later. Katya is Laurel's tutor and seems to be your average friendly character. She definitely buys into the class structure. Mara was Laurel's BFF before she left Avalon. They were close and Laurel was chosen over her to become the Changeling, faerie in human world. During their final visit together, Tamani takes Laurel to a tree made of passed fae. His father was one of the fae who decided to pass his conscience onto the tree by grafting himself onto the tree. A fae is supposed to sit under the tree and ask a question. The wind is then brings the answer. He has asked a question and received and answer, but we do not know either. Her summer ends quickly with Jamison walking her out,giving her a Fall Fae care package, and telling her that she needs to come back. Tamani walks her to her house and David is there waiting for her. Back in the land of humans, the story just continues with a few exceptions. She and David seem to be more physical, Chelsea is seriously dating a guy named Ryan, Laurel's dad has completely accepted her while her mother has distanced herself from Laurel. Laurel blooms again which heats things up with David, but he is a gentleman. They decide to double with Chelsea and Ryan and go to a party. A troll is outisde and chases them off the road on their way home. During the fight Laurel's petals are torn which hurts her. A woman named Kae saves them and she is some type of human supernatural hunter. Laurel does not trust her and I have to agree. Kae is too eager and David is definitely too eager when he accepts guns from her. Laurel goes back to her cottage to clean and tell Tamani what has happened. He helps her and is really upset about her blossom. He wanted to see it in its full gory especially since he missed it the previous year. Their closeness increases and it just feels right although David is perfect. A little too perfect. Things progress back home when Laurel receives an invitation to the New Year's Festival. She decides not to tell David about and sneaks off. Tamani is her escort and again the class thing comes into play. We also learn that there are only three winter Fae, the Queen, Yasmine, and Jamison. Tamani and Laurel have great time and Tamani kisses her. She stalks off and this is when he confronts her about her feelings and knows that she does love him. Laurel feels bad for stringing him along and decides that she has to cut him off. Just when they reach the house David is there and sees them kiss. She sends Tamani away and David leaves her alone. When at home, a ransom note for Chelsea on a rock smashes through Laurel's window. She runs and gets David and they go to the lighthouse to get her. During the battle, Laurel takes out four trolls when Barnes aims guns at Chelsea and David. Laurel surrenders when Kae saves the day again and kills Barnes. He says \"You? But...\" This makes me think that she knows him. They all head back and Kae makes another plea for Laurel to trust her. Chelsea also admits that she knows that Laurel is a faerie which makes Laurel ecstatic. Laurel takes everyone home and then tells David that she has chosen a life with him over Tamani and that she is going to tell him so. This makes David forgive her. In the end, Laurel goes back to the house to discover the Tamani asked for another assignment after Laurel sent him away. Shar also gets her to open up about what happened with Barnes and chastises her for her treatment of Tamani. She skulks off back to her life. Tamani steps out from behind a tree and this whole thing seems to be some sort of plan. His duty is to protect Laurel, but I can't tell if there is more to this. It seems as though he will be following her to protect her. Questions and Predictions - Kae is in league with the trolls and Jamison. I think he believes he should be King and plans to give up Avalon to get the crown. - Laurel is more than just a Fall Fae. The way the other Fae look at her says more. - Something happened before she became a changeling. Why can't they give her her memory back? - The ending makes me suspicious of Tamani. Is he playing with her? Good book until the ending. ...more Well, to be quite honest, I didn't care for this book. The first in the series was much more interesting, maybe because stuff actually happened, but this one just fell flat. 1) Like I said, pretty much nothing happened. Barnes popped up again and that's pretty much the only exciting thing that happened in this book. 2) Too much time was spent on the stupid love triangle. 3)I can't stand David, he's just so annoying... No one is actually that perfect. He's like the Edward of Wings. Actually, he's n Well, to be quite honest, I didn't care for this book.

No one is actually that perfect. He's like the Edward of Wings. Actually, he's not even perfect, Laurel just makes him seem that way. David is so contradictory. He'll act like this really nice and sweet (annoyingly so) guy and then the next he'll be like \"Oh, I'm so cool because I have a gun!\" 4) Well, Laurel gets her OWN little number for me to rant about. Laurel is the most selfish, sniveling little brat of a character EVER. She's flat, completely and utterly flat. I can't understand what sort of character she's supposed to be, she acts like a snarky brat sometimes and other times she acts like a needy brat. She should at least be something, but nooooo... All she ever does is whine about her crappy love life. Two quotes of Laurel that bug me very much: \"... Her two worlds, two lives that she tried so hard to keep separate, were crashing together.\" WOW. Laurel, maybe you should just choose and STOP FREAKING COMPLAINING. Quote number two... \"She closed the fridge and let herself blame David and Tamani a little. She didn't want to hurt either of them, she wanted them both to be happy. They were both important in her life. Why did keep insisting that she choose between them?\" Oh, gee, Laurel, I WONDER. (My poor caps lock key...) I just don't understand how anyone can be so idiotic and self centered that they'd string them both along because she can't seem to make up her mind. Good gracious. 5) It never explained in the book how Chelsea knew about Laurel. I don't understand why Ms. Pike couldn't wait until the next book to introduce that little piece of the story. I feel like that was one of the things the author crammed in at the end to make the book seem like it had some sort of plot. And those are my issues with the book. The only thing I liked in this book was Tam. And if at the end of the book he didn't pull away from Laurel, I would have lost my respect for him. So kudos to him. ...more Ugh! I hate doing negative reviews! Sometimes I don't even know if I should write them or not because I just feel so bad for the author. I've Tweeted with Aprilynn a couple of times, and I think she's such a sweet person, so that makes this even harder.....however......I was really disappointed with this book. There, I said it. Even though I thought Wings was a little strange (it just sounds weird that the Faeries are plants and they keep talking about Laurel's blossom), I did actually enjoy it. Ugh!

Even though I thought Wings was a little strange (it just sounds weird that the Faeries are plants and they keep talking about Laurel's blossom), I did actually enjoy it. So, I was looking forward to this book coming out. I even went to Borders and bought it on release day...without a coupon (lesson learned). The beginning was ok. I was halfway through the book before much time had passed, and I was semi-enjoying it, and waiting for the excitement that was bound to happen at any moment, but I just kept waiting. Seriously, other than a couple of minor run-ins with the same enemies as in Wings.....nothing happened. I thought this book was going to be about Laurel and Tamani, but even when Laurel was in Avalon (which wasn't that much) Tamani was barely there. And when she was home, all she did was work on trying to make potions and lay around with David. At the end of this book, I felt like all the characters were in exactly the same place that they were in at the end of the first book. The only difference was that Laurel got some Faerie schooling (and so did we because there was a lot of descriptions of plants and their magical worth), and meets a suspicious character that I'm assuming we'll find out more about in the next book. All in all, I would say this book was ok, but definitely not worth buying. If you're bored with nothing else to do, go to the library and read it. If you have other books you want to read, skip this one and just head straight for book 3 when it comes out. Shoot me an email and I'll give you a summary :) I'll still be reading book 3 because I did like Wings and I want to know how it ends, but I think this series would've been better without this book, or at least just adding some of its main points to the other books. Sorry Aprilynne! Really! ...more Okay, so if you've read my review on the first book \"wings\" you would've never read this book. It is so stupid I can't even beleive I read it. Okay, so Laurel is so hard done by because she is soooooo \"special\" and she's the best fairy and all of that crap. Okay, now what?

GET A LIFE AND MAYBE YOU MIGHT DESERVE THE TWO GUYS THAT ARE TOTALLY HOT AND OBVIOUSLY LOVE YOU. Okay, for now I have to calm down about Laurel. But just this last thing about something that made me never want to read the next book. The last sentance is probably the worst last sentance I have ever read. For all of you wondering, Timpani end it by saying....\"Oh yeah\" ..........................ARE YOU KIDDING ME? That's the best thing the author could come up with> What was she thinking?

I often couldn't be bothered to pick it up, because I feel the story lacked a lot of polishing. The idea of Avalon is nice, but if you support its claims of awesomeness by putting down A Midsummer Night's Dream, Camelot, and even Eve, all without any sufficient explanation, you get me very annoyed.

No.... Spells did. Luckily the swift kick in the pants was delivered and sweet as anything. LOL Oh, such, beautiful, beautiful elegant writing. Delightful, fantasy descriptions. I am now a little in pain for the 3rd installment. Here\u2019s another crack at this series. And it was pretty much what I expected. Laurel was so annoying in this whole indecisive I can\u2019t choose where I want to be sort of melodrama that pervades the entire book. Worst still is this whole love triangle. She knowingly cheats on David, and he knows she goes to the fairy world to see Tamani. I don\u2019t know about you but that does not scream healthy relationship to me.

Especially when they all get up in arms about it. Woman should just pick a side and stick to it. I mean, aspects of the fairy world were cool. How there\u2019s a whole hierarchy concerning the type of fairy you\u2019re born as and what type of jobs you are then regulated to, which in turn affects who you can and cannot be with in terms of relationships. The glass and potion making bits were rather interesting but I can\u2019t get over the annoying wish-y wash-y dramatics. Laurel was particularly cruel because she\u2019s leading Tamani on and obviously enjoys doing it and then rips his heart out later. And David is just some blob of a guy who\u2019s supposed to be super perfect and understanding and everything which makes him so boring. But, oh no, we have to up the ante because once he gets a gun he\u2019s all these items are powerful weapons we need to have. And Laurel\u2019s all omg, my boyfriend\u2019s turning into one of those gun wielding fiends who don\u2019t understand the feelings of others. Right. Sure. Okay, whatever you say. Then there was the problem with the mythology. I am not really sure what it\u2019s supposed to be. She draws upon Christian mythology, Celtic, Asian, a whole bunch of others, and that faeries speak Gaelic and all sorts of nonsense. Not to mention they have the Seelie and Unseelie courts. What? I am so lost. Perhaps she was trying to make the statement that fairies are all encompassing in their presence of world history but it just does not work. It\u2019s not explained properly or not at all, and you\u2019re left wondering, why is this important to know? But the second half of the book where all the action takes place grabbed my attention and I sped through the pages. It sort of made up for the tedious first half but not so much. I always am up for a good battle resulting in blood, guts, and a vengeance for all. Yet, I can\u2019t get over the excessive and in your face romance triangle that was really tedious to slog through. Perhaps you\u2019ll find it more fun than I did. ...more My Thoughts: First, I want to say I have heard a lot of good and bad reviews about this series. I have heard a lot of people say they wouldn't even attempt to read it. Sucks for them! I loved it! I read Wings in a day and started Spells the next day and read it in 2 sittings. I loved them both. I did like Spells a little more though. In Spells, we are once again introduced to Laurel, her family, her friend Chelsea, her boyfriend David, her other \"friend\" Tamani; who is a fairy!

In Wings, Laurel slowly realized she was a fairy and by Spells, she has accepted this and is trying to cope with it and lead a normal life. Of course nothing can go as planned because she has Trolls hunting her down, wanting crucial information from her. I don't want to give away the whole plot but I loved this book.This book revolves more about Laurel going to Avalon and spending time getting to learn about her heritige (being a fairy). I truly adore this series. I started off so torn between David and Tamani. I mean, come on, David seems like a sweetheart and the kind of guy who will always be there for you. Yes, that's comforting and hot but than there is Tamani who comes off as a hunky awesome guy. You know you shouldn't like him because Laurel is already with David.But you find yourself thinking, come on Tamani, get the girl! And on top of his greatness, he's a fairy! By the time the book ended, I was rooting for Tamani and wanted Laurel and Tamani together. There was so much tension between them I had to reread a few paragraphs just so I could savor it more than once. A big grin would cross my face. Sorry David but I'm more in love with Tamani. Its been a while since I've loved a guy in a book and I'm still awwing over Tamani. Can he please be real? Pretty please! I just loved these books! They are so good! Overall: Loved it! I'm team Tamani! I actually liked Laurel too. The kissing scene between Laurel and Tamani- HOT! I just adored Tamani's personality. The chemistry between them was so awesome. I wish book 3 was already out! The cliffhanger on the last page of Spells makes you just sit there and say, what what what? What is going to happen next??? Cover: Its cute. I like the flowers. ...more Laurel and David make out. A lot. Honestly, it felt like every few pages Laurel and David were making out, and it got pretty nauseating after awhile. I liked David just fine after reading \"Wings,\" but after \"Spells,\" I don't know how anyone could be Team David. All of the Laurel/David chemistry from \"Wings\" vanished, so every time they spewed lovey words and kissed, it felt really strange and forced. I like a good romance as much as the next girl, but I was SO tired of the make out sessions by t Laurel and David make out. A lot.

I like a good romance as much as the next girl, but I was SO tired of the make out sessions by the end of the book. I have hope that making David annoying in this book is all part of a big plan to eventually bring Laurel and Tamani together. I don't know how ANYONE could be cheering for David at this point. And poor Tamani. Laurel's treatment of him was completely appalling. She toyed with him and strung him along to the point where I really couldn't stand her by the end. Let's hope Laurel was acting like this so we can see the process of her maturing and growing as a character in later books. Go Shar for finally putting Laurel in her place regarding her deplorable treatment of Tamani. Poor Tamani seemed a little defeated for a lot of the book, as he wasn't quite as confident and flirtatious as he is in \"Wings.\" Pining for Laurel is just sucking the soul out of his character. Let's hope he comes back as his charismatic, charming self in Book 3 because I'm weary of selfish Laurel using him and bringing him down! the faerie realm from which heroine Laurel was sent years ago to live among humans. This is good for two reasons: first, it lets Pike flex her ample imagination with some serious world-building. From the flashy spun-sugar bubbles and bejewelled marketplace of the Summer fae to the simple gourd homes of the spring folk, this faerie world is gorgeous and beautifully described. It's one of the best things about the book. Pike also develops atmosphere through Tamani's anecdotes and lessons, using faerie vernacular and explaining customs to help readers learn about Avalon along with Laurel. ...more The second book of the wings series is even better than the first. Which sets me on high hopes for the third. The book starts with Lauren going to Avalon for the summer to study as any other fairy does.There she learns stuff about the plants and their abilities and how to create magic potions. She learns more about the fairy world and how everything is working there. And she comes closer to Tamani. Later she leaves Avalon and goes back to her parents and David.

In the first book I liked that Lauren and David were together, but that changed in the second one. Maybe it's the fact that we see and learn more about Tamani but I can say that I like Tamani as much as I like David. The end makes me believe that Tamani will be present in many parts of the third book with or without Laurens knowledge. ...more Spells is the sequel to Aprilynne Pikes Wings . I really liked this addition to the series. It was fun, romantic and I love the characters. But, I have to admit, it was a bit of a let down. I guess I was so excited for this book to come out, and had high expectations for it - it just wasn't as good as the first. There is one big problem with this book that seemed to annoy me the whole was through. Aprilynne Pike's use of the word 'awesome'. Like, every ten pages you see the word 'awesome.'

There is one big problem with this book that seemed to annoy me the whole was through. Aprilynne Pike's use of the word 'awesome'. Like, every ten pages you see the word 'awesome.' Laurel seems to use it a lot and so do her friends. And after a while it gets a bit irritating. The characters that were in the last book are back: Laurel, David, Tamani, Chelsea and even Jerimiah Barnes. Chelsea, David's friend, who was briefly in the last book is in it a lot more now. David is now Laurel's boyfriend, and he is as sweet as ever. In the middle of the book, I was leaning more to Team David, but then it kept changing when Tamani came along. But I'll go more into the 'teams' later. Tamani, in this book, is less cocky than in the first. Actually, I don't find him cocky at all in this. He's more sweet and protective Laurel, and it's sad to see him getting hurt every time they have alone time together. Laurel is nice, but is so... selfish. She is actually quite rude to Tamani, and I don't think she actually deserves him tbh... In this book, you get to see a lot more of Avalon, and you also get to see a lot more interesting characters like the people she meets in Avalon Academy. Okay, so everyone is telling me I have to choose a team, and I'm finding this very, very hard. Tamani is sweet, funny, protective and is always caring for David, but he wants Laurel to be something she's not. And David, on the other hand, is also sweet, nice, and like Tamani, would put his life on the line for her. I feel like Tamani and Laurel have more chemistry, but then if David comes along in the book, I feel like they really should be together. But, I think I really love Tamani's personality a lot more, so I'd probably be Team Tamani, although I still love David. \"I can't just storm in and proclaim my intentions. I can't just 'steal' you away. I just have to wait and hope that, someday, you'll ask,\" Tamani said. \"And if I don't?\" Laurel asked, her voice barely above a whisper. \"Then I guess I'll be waiting forever.\" - That's one of my favourite lines in the book. It really shows Tamani's love for Laurel and is so cute. XD My other favourite Tamani/Laurel scene is when they're dancing in Avalon and in the woods, but I don't want to spoil it by going into detail. So, anyways, I really liked this book; though not as good as the first, I think it was great and I really liked it. My rating 4.5/5 Can't wait for the next book! ...more I was so pleased when I was able to sign up for this book as an ARC. I have been patiently waiting for it to come out so that I could continue the amazing story of Laurel and her new-found faerie blood. I loved the world of Avalon that Pike explored in this book.

How could human life compete with the new and beautiful life as a Fall faerie? The characters that were introduced in 'Wings' were explored more in this second novel. Laurel has been thrust into a position of great responsibility and is being torn between her human life and her inherent faerie gifts. David and Tamani's love for Laurel intensified greatly and had me on the edge of my seat wondering which part of her she would follow to decide who she wanted to be with. The chemistry between both these characters and Laurel was so strong and alluring it made me heartbroken at the end when she actually made her decision. Both these guys have amazing qualities that any girl would love, but as in most hard choices in life, Laurel had to be true to herself in deciding which life to lead. I love the way that Pike writes. I feel like I am actually in the imaginative world that she created through her descriptive and lovely words. And I truly loved the cover of this book. I thought it was creative and enchanting and expressed the dual feelings that Laurel endured during her internal conflict throughout the story. Should she choose to hide her faerie wings in the human world with David, or bring them to full bloom in Avalon with Tamani? Pike kept me on the tip of my toes the whole book, and then ended with a massive cliffhanger that will undoubtedly leave me suspended on my toes until the next book. ...more Wobderful. This is shaping up to be an excellent series and this was almost as good as the first. As usual, i loved the plot and the way the storyline is shaping up. I think it's excellent how little bits and peices of things are falling into place and how things are being set up. My only real issue with this book was that it was a little too...ahh, how do i say this....Tamani light for my taste. I like this series Tamani heavey haha.

Perfrably that she wants to be with Tamani that is :) Yes, Davids a great guy and he has his own qualities but even a blind person can see that it's Tamani she should be with. There's a part of her that David will never be able to fully understand no matter what he tries because he's not a faerie. The ending of this book was very mysterious, although it was good to see things with Barnes concluded. But just what is Tamani about to do that's got Shar so nervous? Can't wait to find out! ...more Great sequel, looking forward to the next. TEAM TAMANI! I was looking for a quick, escapist read a few weeks ago and picked up \"Wings.\" I had heard great things about it, and while it wasn't quite as amazing as everyone had said, it was enjoyable. I was intrigued enough by the character Tamani to want to find out more. \"Spells\" was a decent read. Girls, say it with me: \"TEAM TAMANI ALL THE WAY.\" \"Spells\" wore a little thin in a few parts, and here's why: Laurel cries. A lot. Laurel is needy. A lot. Laurel and David make out. A lot.

Girls, say it with me: \"TEAM TAMANI ALL THE WAY.\" \"Spells\" wore a little thin in a few parts, and here's why: Laurel cries. A lot. Laurel is needy. A lot. Laurel and David make out. A lot. Honestly, it felt like every few pages Laurel and David were making out, and it got pretty nauseating after awhile. I liked David just fine after reading \"Wings,\" but after \"Spells,\" I don't know how anyone could be Team David. All of the Laurel/David chemistry from \"Wings\" vanished, so every time they spewed lovey words and kissed, it felt really strange and forced. I like a good romance as much as the next girl, but I was SO tired of the make out sessions by the end of the book. I have hope that making David annoying in this book is all part of a big plan to eventually bring Laurel and Tamani together. I don't know how ANYONE could be cheering for David at this point. And poor Tamani. Laurel's treatment of him was completely appalling. She toyed with him and strung him along to the point where I really couldn't stand her by the end. Let's hope Laurel was acting like this so we can see the process of her maturing and growing as a character in later books. Go Shar for finally putting Laurel in her place regarding her deplorable treatment of Tamani. Poor Tamani seemed a little defeated for a lot of the book, as he wasn't quite as confident and flirtatious as he is in \"Wings.\" Pining for Laurel is just sucking the soul out of his character. Let's hope he comes back as his charismatic, charming self in Book 3 because I'm weary of selfish Laurel using him and bringing him down! And the conclusion? Anyone who's read the book knows what I'm talking about. I kind of felt like how I did when I read \"Little Women\" for the first time and literally threw the book against the wall when Jo refused Laurie. At least there will be two more books for Laurel to mature and make the right choice. I have faith in you, Aprilynne Pike, that you'll eventually give us readers the conclusion we're all cheering for. I understand that there are two books after this one so you can't exactly resolve the love triangle just yet. All I'm asking is that eventually Laurel will grow up and be with Tamani, and please give us at least one book where she and Tamani are happily together (conflict is okay...just let them face it together). Don't pull a Jane Austen (my favorite author) and make me read 400 pages waiting for the two character to get together, and then I only get to relish five pages where they're finally happy. ...more I was really disappointed with this book. I think the faerie ideas are so interesting, but Laurel's dysfunctional relationship with David really gets in the way. It's no fun to skip half a book just to read the good parts. First, basically I think one of the best things about teen romance is that it can be innocent and fun. The excitement over holding hands and having an arm around you is fun to enjoy. There is no innocent relationship like that in this book. There is a lot kissing and details a I was really disappointed with this book.

There is no innocent relationship like that in this book. There is a lot kissing and details about other stuff that I don't really want to know about or think is really appropriate for a relationship between teens. Second, David and Laurel basically seem to be using each other. David knows Laurel's interested in other people and is not willing to wait until Laurel is ready to choose. Laurel doesn't seem to miss David much, just the cuddling. The fun thing about romance is when two people fall in love with each others minds, not use each other for their bodies. So anyway, yeah, kind of disappointing. ...more Spells is book #2 in the Wings Series by Aprilynne Pike. I had assumed this was a trilogy since it seems like every young adult book that comes out lately is part of a trilogy but alas it's a quartet so there will be 2 more yet to be released books. Illusions comes out in May and the final book in 2012. Oh how I hate waiting for sequels. This book had a great ending. It wrapped up enough to leave me satisfied yet opened things up for something new. I think I enjoyed Spells even more than then boo Spells is book #2 in the Wings Series by Aprilynne Pike.

I love the character Tamani, seriously Laurel wake up and see what is before you! This is a sweet, clean series that I recommend to those who enjoy faerie stories. I really enjoyed learning more about the faerie mythology, much of which was very unique. A good mix of faerie mythology, adventure and romance.
