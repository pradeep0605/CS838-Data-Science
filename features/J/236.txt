He knows it is not as good as his earlier books, which sometimes feel as though they were written by a near stranger, by a person he only half-remembers being. He has poured some of his confusion and disappointment into the novel's central character, along with other self-loathings: his treacherous body, his increasingly unreliable memory, the stream of women who - God knows why - want to sleep with an aging, still famous novelist, and to whose insistent demands he occasionally acquiesces. Against his better judgement, he has taken a side-swipe at his own activities in trying to slow the inevitability of climate change, cruelly satirizing the concerned group of like-minded writers who sometimes appear with him on late-night TV programs that few people watch. He wonders if anybody will recognize himself, but considers it improbable; he has moved around the cards thoroughly enough that no one will spot the lady. He tries not to think about the book's many shortcomings. The passages which laziness and failing imagination have made him haphazardly borrow from his own and other people's writing: an episode from Enduring Love , with the focus slightly changed and Milton replacing Keats; the polar bear theme from that Norwegian novel he read a few years ago; a whole scene from Douglas Adams. Even his timid editor reacted to that last one, and with bad grace he has inserted an explanatory passage that puts him in the clear. Oddly, the thing he feels most distressed about is the letter from his physicist friend, who has faithfully read every line and located a few errors. \" Rest mass, rather than resting mass? And surely you mean Ricci tensor rather than Ricci scalar ?\" Ten minutes on Google show he's right, but it's too much trouble to call the publisher at this stage. The worst part, he thinks as he pours himself another glass of Macallan, is that it's good enough. He has accumulated an army of loyal fans, and they won't desert him at this late hour. There is plenty of his trademark prose, even if he sometimes lapses into telling rather than showing for pages at a time. The opening is strong and will suck people in. He has cleverly rearranged the timeline to create the necessary dramatic tension, as the plot moves towards a climax as mechanical as that in the only explicit sex scene. It will attract a few positive reviews; who knows, some of them may even be sincere. Above all, he knows it's a page-turner. But he still feels disgusted with his technical competence, and he has marked that in one of the more bitterly self-referential passages. He re-reads it, and feels an obscure satisfaction. Maybe a few other readers will also be amused for a moment. He took the bag in both hands and pulled its neck apart, discharging a clammy fragrance of frying fat and vinegar. It was an artful laboratory simulation of the corner fish and chip shop, an enactment of fond memories and desire and nationhood. That flag was a considered choice. He lifted clear a single crisp between forefinger and thumb, replaced the bag on the table, and sat back. He was a man to take his pleasures seriously. The trick was to set the fragment on the centre of the tongue and, after a moment's spreading sensation, push the potato up hard to shatter against the roof of the mouth. His theory was that the rigid irregular surface caused tiny abrasions in the soft flesh into which salt and chemicals poured, creating a mild and distinct pleasure-pain... The salty residue from the first round gave him the impression that he was bleeding from the gums. He slumped back in his seat, opened his mouth and repeated the experiment, although this time he kept his eyes open. Inevitably, the second crisp was less piquant, less surprising, less penetrating than the first, and it was this shortfall, this sensual disappointment, that prompted the need, familar to drug addicts, to increase the dose. He pours a third glass. ...more The main character in <+++>Solar</+++> can\u2019t control his appetites.

Sound like any species you know? <---C>Michael Beard</---C> is an English physicist who once won a Nobel Prize and has been coasting off that accomplishment ever since. Rather than do any more work in physics, he\u2019s content to give lectures and take a series of figurehead jobs. He\u2019s also been married five times and has never been faithful to any of them, but wife #5, Patrice, has turned the tables by having an open affair with a workman doing repairs on their house. Naturally, the self-absorbed Beard wants what he can\u2019t have and becomes obsessed with winning Patrice\u2019s love again. He\u2019s also taken a job as the titular head of an English think tank working on alternative energy sources and stopping global warming. Beard believes in the science of climate change, but he figures it\u2019ll be somebody else\u2019s problem after he\u2019s dead so he\u2019s really only interested in the paycheck. A zealous young researcher is driving him nuts by wanting to work on solar energy instead of the worthless wind turbine Beard has committed the institute to building. A freak accident puts Beard in a position to claim credit for groundbreaking research and just maybe invent a whole new energy industry and save the world. If he can put aside his greed and need for instant gratification long enough to make it work. Clever, Mr. McEwan. Very clever. Using a brilliant but lazy man who knows full well that he\u2019s courting disaster with his lifestyle and his actions, but is just too weak willed to do anything about it as both a potential savior and symbolic destroyer of the world was a nice piece of work. ...more So I imagine young novelists are a promiscuous bunch.

And I'm sure it's great fun for awhile, but it's not what they're ultimately after. No novelist wants to play the field forever! And some do find that special novel early, while for others it takes a lot longer time. Some never do find it, and remain lifelong bachelors, which eventually does become a bit tragic, a guy in his forties chatting up ironic twists on noir that are way too young for him... but I'm not talking about them, the ones still out tom-catting around. I'm thinking about novelists who did find the One. It's the match they've been searching for, they settle down and buy a house. The novelist and his novel are a symbiotic unit. They socialize with other couples in the cul-de-sac, their kids all play together. The novelists belong to the same club, and their novels are close. When the novelists take the train in together, they ask after each other's novel, with whom they're familiar old friends. And maybe it goes a little beyond that. As happy as each novelist is with his novel, after some time he can't help noticing how well the other novelist's novel has kept itself up. (Maybe it's all those pilates classes? There's something about the other novelist's novel's thick red hair and super-meta twist endings....) As the years go by the other novelist's novel starts looking.... well, sorry, but novel. Because while there's nothing like coming home to one's own novel each night, the truth must be told that there is nothing quite like coming home to one's own novel each night.... and it could also be the truth that these novelists and their respective novels are in a bit of a rut, and haven't slept together in months. You know how it is. All this endless babble (anyone still there?) is to say, that I finally figured out what went wrong with fiction this summer: <---A>Ian McEwan</---A> and Martin Amis went to a key party. They swapped novels, and the results -- while perhaps an invigorating experience for each middle-aged novelist himself -- were far from successful in this reader's eyes. Full disclosure: I'm only halfway through Solar right now, and am on the fence about whether I should keep reading. (Any opinions on that?) I did manage to finish The Pregnant Widow , Martin Amis's take on the McEwanesque themes of a bygone era and erotic longings, but I'm finding this one even less fun. See, youthful sex in an 1960s Italian castle would've been great if McEwan were writing it. But Amis isn't lyrical. Worse, though: McEwan isn't funny. Michael Beard, the Nobel-prize winning physicist of Solar , is a classic Amis antihero, but with a lot of melted ice. That is, John Self of Money and Richard Tull of The Information are revolting losers who are driven into the ground by their appetites and too horrifically flawed to be real. But McEwan can't pull off the biting, stinging nausea that's Amis's so-bad-it's-good trademark. He isn't funny -- not to me, anyway -- and he just can't go gonzo. This book has slapstick moments, what I suppose was meant to be satire, and plenty of scenes that should have been ludicrous. But the volume's never up high enough, and it's all tempered by that patented lovely-sentenced restraint. The rather bloodless result is something that is not great the way I expect McEwan to be great (to be fair, I've only read a couple of his books), and certainly doesn't meet the searing demands of the topic he's chosen. Martin Amis should be writing about climate change! His take on human greed, sloth, and blind grabbing depravity is uniquely suited to this topic. McEwan's is not. McEwan should be writing stuff like the scene in this book that describes landing at Heathrow, but he shouldn't be writing a Martin Amis novel (he also shouldn't be writing a Richard Powers novel, but that's another rant). And this really isn't the place to expand on this, but to be fair, the hollow, ineffective, and almost comically amateurish ending of The Pregnant Widow might be something McEwan would've handled brilliantly. Your friend Ian's rendition of \"Once in a Lifetime\" is inimitable, Martin! So sit down and watch, and don't try it yourself. Enough of an experiment, you married that novel for a reason. Now go home to her, boys, and tell her you love her. ...more I was reading in bed last night--I was a little more than half-way through--and it hit me: it is taking way too long to read this thing.

I'm done. I'll go find a new one tomorrow at the library. It's really disappointing too, because when I read the premise, it sounded great! But McEwan spends so much time on these little details that he forces unnaturally into metaphors that you find you are stuck reading about how the human race is like a healthy spore a few different times a few different ways. (That particular analogy, by the way, was pretty good, until he pointed it out and forced me to see it rather than letting me come to the relationship on my own.) The main character is well developed, but that doesn't make him any less boring. He's an old man who sucks at relationships, and that's another thing we spend every few pages being told. Does he do nothing other than think about his past marriages and how to screw up future ones? Anyway, yes, I found this book to be a massive disappointment and must add it as my second book I couldn't finish. How depressing is that? ...more Nobel Laureate in Physics Michael Beard is a truly revolting piece of work: a slave to his appetites, whose progress through the novel is just one orgiastic frenzy of wenching, gourmandizing self-indulgence because, after all, curbing his sybaritic excess would just be too .... inconvenient.

If you think it's a stroke of genius by Ian McEwan to use this troglodyte as a heavy-handed symbol of the kind of behavior that's causing global warming, then good for you. Let me know if you still feel that way after 300 pages spent with your nose forced into every appalling detail of Beard's ghastly descent. Personally, it felt like torment to me. Don't get me wrong. McEwan's got the writing chops. There are whole paragraphs that are hilarious, or exquisitely written, or both. But my guess is that when you turn the page that begins the final section, you'll just wish the whole damned thing was over already. I was really pissed off that McEwan pulls a Don Giovanni at the end, denying the reader the emotional catharsis of describing the gory details of Beard's downfall. Two other aspects that bothered me: Though McEwan has obviously done his homework to the extent of crafting sections about physics that are entirely plausible, I'm not sure to what end. It all seems a little pointless. The notion that Beard is some kind of irresistible babe magnet is just too ludicrous to swallow. He's a pig. I sincerely doubt that Nobel prize is going to overcome his swinishness. This book is another example where McEwan's talent seems to have been mischanneled. This is an intermittently amusing, but ultimately repulsive story which showcases McEwan's cleverness, but seems empty at its core. ADDENDUM: When I think about it, this book was never going to work for me, as I detest books where the reader gets stuck in the mind of a particularly obnoxious character. I should probably develop some kind of brief coding for reviews of books like this, as I know other readers are not necessarily bothered as much by loathsome protagonists as I am. ...more Out of all his novels, Solar , according to Ian McEwan himself, is the one that bombed in the United States.

To this layman\u2019s eyes, it alternately swamped the story and lent it authenticity. It is the story of a rotund, full-of-himself British scientist/misogynist who is on his way out of his fifth marriage and into obese middle age. He is smart, cynical and socially inept. His unsuccessful personal relations reminded me of characters in other of McEwan\u2019s novels, though Beard is one his most selfish and least likeable characters. Despite not really liking the story much, I nonetheless succumbed to McEwan\u2019s storytelling ability: the laughable, implausible incident at the North Pole; the urban myth-like story from the train; the speech at The Savoy, which is surely McEwan\u2019s own save-the-planet message. This last item \u2013 and the many scientific tidbits along the way \u2013 clearly demonstrated (as in many of his other novels) the extent to which McEwan has researched the subject matter of the novel. Like Beard, McEwan went to the North Pole to see for himself the results of increased global temperatures, and he has delved into extensive scientific reports and documents, the evidence of which was often beyond me but which I couldn\u2019t help hoping that leading politicians around the world would read and take to heart. Too bad that the struggle to save the planet, in literary terms, was in the hands of someone like Michael Beard, but according to McEwan the novel is a comedy showcasing the failings of human nature \u2013 globally and individually. Well, in that it is successful. Impeccable prose in a story as heartless as stainless steel, this latter being presumably the reason why there seems to be such strong opinions against McEwan, something I\u2019ve never quite understood. ...more 'Solar' no se parece a ninguno de los libros que he le\u00eddo anteriormente de Ian McEwan.

According to some critics of McEwan\u2019s Solar I should, since its hero, Michael Beard, is a despicable character, a philanderer, a plagiarist, an egocentric and a criminal liar\u2026 whom I totally liked. Moreover, it is a long time since I have been so immersed in a reading to forget everything around me \u2013 last week I almost missed the metro stop on my way to university, such I was enjoying this crazy, crazy book, which rose conflicting reactions in its readers. One of the most acerbic reviews was written immediately after its apparition in 2010 by Jason Cowley in The Guardian ( here it is ). The journalist pointed out mercilessly many of what he considered the minuses of the novel, from the one-dimensional character to the trodden subject, from the sometimes nonsensical comedy to the lack of other perspectives, ending with a graphical image of the book as an empty room in which only the groan-like confession \u201cof a fat, selfish man in late middle age eating himself\u201d can be heard. However seductive this metaphor of a novel speaking like an echoic chamber, I beg to differ. Not against the observations per se, they are true enough, but against the implication they are flaws. In my opinion, Solar is brilliantly a one-man\u2019s show. Is this one-man, Michael Beard, also one-dimensional? Absolutely, since it is the only voice of the narrative (mocking objectivity with its third person) \u2013 I should hope this is the interpretation the critic gave to the term, because even though the hero doesn\u2019t change \u2013 and is proud of this \u2013 he is by no means a flat, superficially built character. Although he has some caricatural traits, they are not inconsistent with his type (and I agree with Jason Cowley regarding the neo-realistic style of the author) and reminded me vividly of David Lodge\u2019s academic figures. Furthermore, he is so forgiving of his own behaviour, so candid in the admiration of his own consistency in vice and weakness he doesn\u2019t try to hide at all, and so determined to resist any woman who would try and change him that he is really touching: Beard comfortably shared all of humanity\u2019s faults, and here he was, a monster of insincerity, cradling tenderly on his arm a woman he thought he might leave one day soon, listening to her with sensitive expression in the expectation that soon he would have to do some talking himself, when all he wanted was to make love to her without preliminaries, eat the meal she had cooked, drink a bottle of wine, and then sleep \u2013 without blame, without guilt. Michael Beard is indeed a zany fighter for his right to be questionable, to take off his mask of decency and scientific morgue, that is, to come down the pedestal of a Nobel laureate and happily mix with (very) lesser beings. Life is a nightmare, but a funny one, so why not try it all? I think the comedy is genially built precisely on this humorous interpretation of the philosophy of solipsism, that is, on the hero\u2019s belief that his space is inhabited only by him and the others are there to please, importunate or serve him, but they do not have a life independently of him. Like any minor god, he becomes nasty only when the others try to assert their own existence. This is so human a reaction that even when his conduct is blatantly immoral, the reader empathizes with him and judges its behaviour rather leniently. This bald, fat man had it all and, despite his great talent, scattered it all. And here it might be discovered, in my opinion, the real theme of this superb book: not to depict Beard as a symbol of the consumerism and waste that haunt our times (as Cowley observed) \u2013 this is a secondary, even though very clever theme \u2013 but to answer an old question: does the spark of genius excuse a questionable behaviour? Theoretically, and in true political correctness, it doesn\u2019t excuse it at all, but what a consolation for everyday people! His misadventures and misconduct can be so easily identified with that it also seems (to our secret delight) that his genius can also be identified with. For here you have a Nobel laureate with a noble mission: to save the world by making the planet green. The same man who made an accident look as a murder in order to frame the lover of his wife, the same man who based his research in artificial photosynthesis on the work of his late student, without mentioning him at all, the same man who sincerely suffered for his wife\u2019s infidelity while he had eleven affairs in the five years of marriage, and so on, and so forth. And, like I said, what makes him even more approachable is that he doesn\u2019t oppose his character at all, he is indulgent with himself and invites the others to do the same: He was self-sufficient, self-absorbed, his mind a cluster of appetites and dreamy thoughts. Like many clever men who prize objectivity, he was a solipsist at heart, and his heart was a nugget of ice\u2026 Towards the end of his story and possibly his life he has the same epiphany as most of us: the humans cannot really change, not even a Nobel prize, not even a great cause, not even a child can fundamentally transform a criminal into a law-abiding citizen, a cheat into a faithful husband, in a word, a lesser person into a better one. And this comical resignation to a dishonourable fate is the best excuse also for us, for all our past and future failures \u2013 so how can we not sympathise with him, how can we not feel, like him, cheated? The surprise was this: his existence since Catriona\u2019s birth was much as before. His friends had told him he would be astonished, he would be transformed, his values would change. But nothing was transformed. Catriona was fine, but he was the same old mess. And now that he had entered upon the final active stages of his life, he was beginning to understand that, barring accidents, life did not change. He had been deluded. The extraordinary talent of Ian McEwan regaled us with another book in which apparently incompatible ingredients blended perfectly: extensive scientific vocabulary and research jargon which could arise an inferiority complex in the profane reader but read surprisingly well; an excellent comedy of situations and characters which would deserve an extensive study of its own; an anti hero so happy with his \u201canti\u201d condition that he becomes, against all expectations, an almost reliable narrator; and last but not least, an unexpected open ending, by cruelly cutting the narrative at its rising point, at the very moment when all ghosts of the past gather to beset our hero. How and if he gets rid of this can only be guessed, although it is devilishly suggested by the narrative voice that the swelling he feels in his heart for his daughter and which he takes for love could be in fact the onset of a heart attack which would solve all his problems once and for all. Tabor Fischer, complaining about \u201cthe brakes\u2026 applied rather forcefully\u201d supposes wishfully that they are due to a sequel. I should hope not. Such a book could only have such an ending. ...more In this satirical novel Ian McEwan creates the unlikeable Michael Beard, Nobel Prize winning Physicist.

With his best work behind him, Michael is an overweight womaniser who lives off speaking engagements and memberships of Boards. At the start of the novel he has recently been appointed to head a new Centre looking for novel ways of generating renewable energy. For some reason Michael Beard is a magnet to younger women. He is currently on his 5th marriage and, for some reason that is not clear to me, has had a multitude of mistresses and one night stands, despite his acknowledged slovenliness. He is not really engaged in finding solutions to climate change and barely pays any attention to his work. All this changes when one day he returns from a conference to find one of his younger colleagues in his living room dressed only in a dressing gown. In creating Michael Beard, the author has created a truly despicable man, one who cheats on his wives and partners as well as his employer and colleagues. He is opportunistic and seems to get away with it until his past starts to catch up with him. While I think McEwan is trying to point out the comparison with our politicians disinterest and failure in acceptng and dealing with climate change, I failed to wholly engage with this novel. Although there were some rays of brilliance amongst the dross, this isn't one of McEwan's best novels.3.5 \u2605 ...more A Nobel winning physicist is approaching the descending side of his life.

Michael Beard\u2019s had five wives with each marriage leaving a bigger pile of emotional junk in its wake. He can\u2019t or won\u2019t grow up. He just stays in motion hoping it will all sort itself out. It doesn\u2019t. It gets worse. By the end of the book there are sweltering piles of personal and professional cacao threatening to fall on him. In classic McEwen style there is a pivot incident that changes or enhances the trajectory of Beard\u2019s life. The ensuing tragedy begets a kind of second life to both his career and his personal realm. There are funny scenes in the book but no belly laughs. They\u2019re more of a one side of the mouth raised and a strangled guffaw type. Honestly this guy is so pathetic you want to jump into the book and drag him to safety, along with some of his hapless \u2018victims\u2019. This wasn\u2019t one of my favorite McEwen novels but I still loved it. Especially wonderful was his description of southwest America. This is where his wry sense of humor really goes hot. The heat of this lonely area with its orange sunsets, the contrasts between the hyper cooled indoors and the stalking blanket of heat outside, the people who are at once expansive in their open hearts and provincial in their viewpoints. When you think of someone who\u2019s reached such a level as Beard\u2019s character there\u2019s a certain perception or expectation of sophistication and maturity. Beard defies such characterization. Toto\u2019s pulled the curtain away, by the end Beard is standing naked with a spotlight on him. Solar indeed. ...more Non posso dire che non mi sia piaciuto, ma non sto nemmeno stappando lo champagne. Andiamo per ordine. McEwan stilisticamente parlando \u00e8 a dir poco brillante.

McEwan stilisticamente parlando \u00e8 a dir poco brillante. Anche se parlasse della passeggiata col suo cane, riuscirebbe a far resuscitare i morti con quelle sue frasi che sembrano buttate cos\u00ec a caso, come quando di getto si tira gi\u00f9 la lista della spesa, ma che sono dissacranti, taglienti e ironiche, e a maggior ragione illuminanti. E vi assicuro, che raggiungere questi risultati tutti insieme, in una frase ogni due (dai, facciamo tre) per trecento pagine, \u00e8 da veri fuoriclasse. Poi, la vedete la copertina? Un bel Sole in primo piano. Eh, ma mica penserete di cavarvela con la copertina e basta vero? No, perch\u00e9 McEwan \u00e8 giusto un pelo meticoloso sui riferimenti tecnico-nozionistici. Roba che alla fine del libro, avrete due opzioni: se siete interessati minimamente all\u2019aspetto scientifico, otterrete la laurea in fisica, se siete neofiti e cocci come me, per simpatia vi ritroverete perlomeno abbronzati. Potenza dell\u2019elioterapia. La trama poi \u00e8 banalmente geniale. Un uomo meschino, pigro e lussurioso, che pensa cose meschine, pigre e lussuriose per tutta la vita, anche quando gli vengono offerte occasioni per redimersi. Voi direte: dove sta la genialit\u00e0? Sta nel fatto che McEwan ha preso cose e situazioni che viviamo tutti i giorni, ha pensato brutture mediocri che in momenti di cinismo aberrante pensiamo anche noi (dalla lotta corpo a corpo con chi ci sorpassa nella fila al checkin, ai meccanismi egoistici che si innescano allorquando vogliamo tenerci stretti una situazione che ci fa comodo, fosse anche un matrimonio!) e poi con molta scioltezza ha fotografato questi pensieri fugaci, che noi non riusciremo mai n\u00e9 a immortalare, n\u00e9 tanto meno a confessare, qualora avessimo la botta di culo di riuscire a catturarli e a isolarli. Facendo quindi un bilancio veloce sui punti su citati, la morale \u00e8 altalenante ma decisiva. La trovate bella comoda proprio in fondo al libro, esattamente nell\u2019ultimissima frase. E oscilla tra il detto \u201cVulpes pilum mutat, non mores\u201d alla favola di Pierino e il lupo. Da questa recensione purtroppo per\u00f2 rimane fuori l\u2019aggettivo \u201ccoinvolgente\u201d che mi fa levare un paio di stelle dal punteggio. Ma non mi arrendo, le premesse perch\u00e9 McEwan mi piaccia ci sono. Perci\u00f2, Au revoir Ian, ci vediamo (io fiduciosa, tu magistrale come sempre)su un altro tuo libro. P.S.

Rating: 4* of five The Publisher Says : \"My name is David Brandstetter. I'm a claims investigator for the Medallion Life Insurance Company.\" He handed her a card. She didn't glance at it. \"I'm looking for Peter Oats,\" he said. \"He's not here. I wish he were. Maybe you can help me. The police don't seem to care.\" She was April Stannard. Her lover, Peter's father, had died. April believed he'd been murdered. Dave Brandstetter's investigation takes him through the rare-book world, to backstage at a community theatre, to the home of a world-famous television performer. Along the way, Dave soon comes to agree with April. My Review : Small-town California has a lot of atmosphere, according to Hansen; I don't remember it that way, but I was young and miserable, so I'll go with the man who found there something that led to this description of an old mill made into a theater: The waterwheel was twice a man\u2019s height, wider than a man\u2019s two stretched arms. The timbers, braced and bolted with rusty iron were heavy, hand-hewn, swollen with a century of wet. Moss bearded the paddles, which dripped as they rose. The sounds were good. Wooden stutter like children running down a hall at the end of school. Grudging axle thud like the heartbeat of a strong old man. Beautiful. It's with this book, second in the series, that Hansen's chops come fully into play. He's here to wow you, and he's got the story to keep you sitting right there flipping pages. April, the bereaved, is Rita Hayworth in my mind; Oates, the dead guy, looks like John Garfield; Peter, the son and heir, is Cabaret -era Michael York; and so on and so on. (Eve, Oates' ex-wife, is Barbara Stanwyck.) I do this a lot, cast the perfect movie cast as I read along. But this time it felt as if it was all done for me. Oates' murderer, when revealed, was a surprise to me even though this was a re-read. And the actor I'd put in the role was perfect...no testament to my skills, just an example of how beautifully Hansen draws his characters. Dave's got a man, too...how amazing for the 1970s! I so wish this had been a TV series. Magnum PI only gay! *sigh* What might have been....

It is supposed to be satire and comedy and I know the protagonist, Michael Beard is not supposed to be likeable (that bit is successful), but for me the whole did not work. The novel is in three sections set in 2000, 2005 and 2009 seeing Beard move from 53 to 62; from the demise of his fifth marriage to an ending that is pretty much left open. The climate change part is pretty much incidental and rests on Beard (a Nobel laureate) developing/nicking a way of mimicking photosynthesis to generate power. Most of the novel revolves around Beard\u2019s complex and convoluted love life and there is no getting away from it as you spend a great deal of time in Beard\u2019s head. He has no real care for the women he uses, is incapable of being faithful, knows no boundaries to his appetites and is thoroughly self centred. As an aside, Beard is in his 50s, overweight and seems to be infernally attractive to women, much younger women. This may be authorial or more likely male wish fulfilment (mind you, it\u2019s not a phenomenon I\u2019ve noticed!) On completing the book, it just felt very slight and self indulgent with little point. I\u2019m sure there are men like Beard around (too many of them) whose only real sorrow is getting caught, but in the context of this novel, it just didn\u2019t work. The small glimmer of redemption for Beard, his young daughter and her unconditional love for him, also fell flat because it felt like an afterthought. On reflection maybe the book would have been better without the three time sections and without some of the background of climate change. It felt like McEwan really wanted to write about Beard\u2019s sex life and his relationships with women and didn\u2019t weave in the other strands. It was just frustrating, irritating and left me cold ...more For days I've been trying to think all the reasons why this novel disappointed me so much, even as I was one of the many in our bookclub to enthusiastically vote it for our April read.

Normally I quite enjoy Ian McEwan, though other than On Chesil Beach, his books--even when I admire them--leave me with a tingling sense of annoyance that I never before understood. Until I read today's excellent NY Times review, which, summed up, pretty much labels it an overwritten, overstretched 'too-good' novel--so good, in fact, that it's actually quite bad. An assessment I totally agree with, both in the case of 'Solar' and for too-good pieces of art in general. It's like beauty, really. When something, or someone, is too beautiful, there's nothing to grab, and so beauty actually becomes mundane to the point, as this NY Times reviewer puts it, of 'nullity'--great word. Life, and art, and people, are or should be messy (therefore, never perfect) in order to be properly good, or properly beautiful. McEwan seems to miss this. The best line in the NY Times book review: In \u201cSolar,\u201d McEwan\u2019s Cordon Bleu prose is like that: a buttery, rich sauce ladled onto overcooked, dry meat to help readers swallow an otherwise indigestible meal.\" Fantastic--so much better than the book! :) ...more Great satire of a scientist who is all too human in his appetites, insecurities, and problems in relationships.

And there's something freeing in seeing the seedier side of humanity at the center of his stories as they-we-are the center of their-our-lives. His characters are flawed in the direction of barely salvageable. They're not excitingly \"dark\", just selfish and self-serving in the banal of ways, although this sometimes leads to devastating consequences. Beard may be the apotheosis of this type of character. Not quite \"perfectly\" bad, not evil, but unbearably self-indulgent, with a record of past brilliance which he is ready to dine off the rest of his life until a series of circumstances-and actions as well, though he might barely acknowledge it-give him an unearned fresh lease on fame and scientific prestige. As an English major, I read of Beard's dismissal of the arts- \"From the moment he won Maisie, he was intellectually free\"-and wondered, what if in his campaign of seduction in which he studied Milton to win the girl, he'd discovered another world? What if it had opened him up instead of confirming his smugness? But then, he'd hardly be the self-satisfied character he is and this book would not exist. Solar has flashes of poetry as well as consistently fine writing; in the inevitable airport (a location I have to admit to loving as both liminal and mundane), Beard muses, In an airport, of course, \"He was thinking of that time [right after college], the way one does on long journeys when rootlessness and boredom, lack of sleep or routine can summon from out of nowhere random stretches of the past, make them as real as a haunting. And he was almost there now, here, in the dining room of the Randolph, in suit and tie and the white shirt he had ineptly ironed himself.\" Despite all this, and understanding so many of the reviews I've read, I deeply enjoyed this book. I even (for reasons unclear to me) came to care about Beard. At least a little. ...more McEwan, Ian. SOLAR. (2010). *****.

SOLAR. (2010). *****. Mr. McEwan has done it again \u2013 created the perfect novel that explores a man\u2019s life and life work. This time, his subject is Michael Beard. Dr. Beard is a Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist who won the prize by elucidating and expanding on one of Einstein\u2019s basic theoretical proposals. This work was done when he was in his twenties. Now, it\u2019s twenty years later and he hasn\u2019t been able to anything of any note since. He has been living off his past glory by serving on committees and heading up study groups and appearing on letterheads of technical organizations. He has also complicated his life by his philandering ways. He is now on wife number five. His problem with the first four wives is that they all discovered that he was having multiple affairs while married to them. They all divorced him. He has assured himself that this will not be the case with wife number five. He really believes that he loves her, and, aside from a few meaningless affairs has remained true to her. She finds out about one of his affairs, however, and is determined to get her own back. She blatantly has an affair with, first, their local handyman, which she doesn\u2019t try to hide in the least. Michael becomes indignent, but is powerless in the face of a younger, stronger man. After being away on a business trip, he discovers a young man asleep on his couch in his home when he arrives. It is one of the young scientists who works for him at one of the institutes he kind-of manages, one devoted to seeking out and implementing alternative sources of energy. While in the heat of an argument, the young man slips on the bearskin rug and hits his head on a glass coffee table. It is quickly determined that he is dead. Michael quickly devises a way to kill two birds with one stone, and plants evidence that the local handyman was in fact responsible for the young man\u2019s death. Later, a file of papers, marked personal and confidential for Dr. Beard, were found among the young man\u2019s effects. They were found to contain this young scientist\u2019s work on the use of a reverse engineered use of the photosynthesis process to produce clean, cheap, endless energy for the world. What Michael does with this information and how it affects his life. It ultimately allows him to get himself out of the mess he has created for himself with all of his women, and gets him reinspired to do the work for which he was trained. He is now poised to save the world from environmental disaster \u2013 global warming. The novel is darkly satirical, and shows human frailty at its worst. Given the gravity of the subject matter, however, McEwan manages to inject a lot of humor into his tale. Highly recommended. ...more This is Ian McEwan\u2019s latest novel.

The \u201chero\u201d of the novel is an inherently unlikeable person, rich in the unattractive traits of a certain type of self-important Englishman, whose weaknesses (principally for women and food) are counterbalanced by his seeming brilliance as a Nobel prize-winner. He has 5 marriages past him, and most recently is in relationships on both sides of the Atlantic, and the climax of his life is about to be reached when all of the variously separated strands of his life come together, with the inevitable disaster that explodes in a diner in New Mexico. Mr. McEwan has meticulously researched the underlying scientific basis of this novel, and for that he deserves credit. But, the real genius of this work is to intertwine the science with the character, and a plot that is undoubtedly brilliant, and will leave the reader highly entertained and wanting more, much much more! ...more As I started the second part of this book, I started wondering if this could end up being the first McEwan book that I didn't like at all. But I also had the feeling that I could trust him, and I was right to do so -- the 'bad' feeling quickly went away. Some of the humor was not to my liking, in particular a slapstick-y episode early on and a 'gross-out' scene later on.

Some of the humor was not to my liking, in particular a slapstick-y episode early on and a 'gross-out' scene later on. But the latter wasn't too bad, considering, and I still could appreciate how well done the former was. A few things later on seemed repetitive (though come to think of it, 'repetition' is one of the themes) -- for example, I think I know what the point was of all the kissing between the main character and a certain woman, okay, two women, but I'm not sure all of it was necessary. Despite these criticisms, McEwan's prose is as precise and as smooth as ever, maybe even more so. I also think there is true genius in this book. There is a point to the shenanigans, to the set-pieces, to the absurdities, though to say what it is would be to give away too much. I will say that though the main character may seem too large (and I don't mean just literally) of life to be real, I think that what is really being skewered here is the fallibility of human nature. ...more Not my favourite McEwan novel but a fine story nonetheless. Michael Beard is one of those characters you want to throttle publicly, yet privately you egg him on. I think my first Goodreads review has to be defending this old favourite, which is absolutely in my top three Ian McEwan books and also my top twenty books ever. You're not interested in me, but when someone who reads a significant amount has a book among their all-time favourites that book must have some redeeming qualities, I find.

You're not interested in me, but when someone who reads a significant amount has a book among their all-time favourites that book must have some redeeming qualities, I find. Solar is the story of Michael Beard. Michael Beard has been characterised among reviewers and Ian McEwan fans as \"obnoxious\", and they say this ruins the book, because we spend all of the relatively long novel in his company. I must respectfully disagree, though I haven't read anyone who agrees with me. I'll come right out and say it - Solar is a long book which is an analogy for global warming. But you knew that. And Michael Beard reflects this, in a way many seem to have wantonly ignored. He is not obnoxious - he is entirely uncaring, disconnected from the human experience. He crushes things and people in his path without remorse, it is true, but he also does it without vindictiveness. Michael Beard is a perfect reflection of the benign indifference of the global warming phenomenon and reviewers who term Michael obnoxious - would I dare say they are a perfect reflection of those who choose to ignore reality in favour of ease? Solar is a fabulous book. Some call it slow: you may find it slow. I did not, at any point. Clearly, I stand alone. Nonetheless, there are moments of brilliance in Solar, and there are moments of slightly lesser brilliance. But I didn't find any paragraphs which didn't give me the old chill of a good Ian McEwan, from his A Child in Time and Black Dogs phase. And the ending - I will avoid spoilers, but suffice it to say (or will it suffice? I can only hope) that critics calling it abrupt and unsatisfying are. Well. Misguided. I found it one of the most poignant endings I've recently experienced. I sat on my bed and cried. And that's a wonderful thing, especially for something so scientific like global warming to bring such intense human emotion out of me. Solar is well worth a read, because for some people it will just be another book and for some it will be extraordinary. And if you, like me, are one of those who find it extraordinary, you don't want to miss out on the feeling it will bring you. It was a cold night in the middle of November and I had just finished the book I read after Solar. It was a good book, and yet at its moment of climax I remember distinctly thinking \"I miss Michael Beard\". Solar haunted me then, and it still does now, because it resonates, and that is all I ask for. ...more I was disappointed and surprised with this novel. I was disappointed since I expected much more from McEwan's prose and because this novel spent so much time on Beard's love life and gluttony, which bored me.

About three quarters of the book was concerned with Beard's activities of daily life, the rest about climate change and his attempt to create a new system of clean energy beyond nuclear. The latter is most important, the former is least. Yet McEwan did a much better with his ecoFIction, than with his human relationships fiction. The latter seemed like a B-romantic comedy, Perhaps the point of the book is that in the face of catastrophic climate change, catastrophic for human civilization, humans remain most concerned with their little lives, comforts, eating, screwing... sleeping, showering... playing political games, messing with lawyers and bureaucrats... As Beard's hope of re-achieving breakthrough science fails, so does humanities hope of avoiding the climate catastrophe. It will be too late when the problem becomes short term.
