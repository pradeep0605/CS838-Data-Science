Aw, f*ck it. Read his goddamn book and laugh, you m*therf*ckers. He was a dirty, foul-mouthed son of a bitch, but he said what he thought and never gave a damn what other people thought of him. That c*cks*cker's all right in my book. He knew the true nature of humanity - we are such evil, vicious bastards that we would invent something as destructive and painful as napalm, but at the same time we can create something whose sole purpose is to bring whimsy into our lives - silly putty. Carlin knew that humans were impossible to categorize as \"good\" or \"evil\" and he let us know that as loudly as possible. We're gonna miss you, ya grouchy pr*ck. ...more I knew what I was getting when I started this book -- one of the many books written by the late <---A>George Carlin</---A>.

You had his typical Carlin comments about government, politics, sex, drugs, music, sports, religion -- typical in that in the anti-establishment world of George Carlin, no subject was immune to his thinking and he made you think about the day-to-day events impacting these subjects from a humorous/cynical perspective. Again, what made Carlin so funny was his presence on stage and his rapid fire delivery about his perception of the world. Attending a George Carlin concert was an adventure in humor that got people to think about their fellow human and rampant absurdities that impact our lives. Sure, you can watch a video, but Carlin was at his best in a live auditorium. As good as he was, his series of books don't capture the same magic as his live performances. Frankly, all but his final book leave the impression that Carlin was a man bitter at the world, lashing out at everything he critique. I suppose a new reader curious of the Carlin mystique would appreciate the printed cynicism that made Carlin great on stage, but this book and others like it really don't reflect the true genius that Carlin exhibited as a touring humorist. ...more Another fantastic book by Carlin. My particular favorite from this one is the bit about airplanes. Just fantastic. I was laughing so hard that I couldn't breathe! One of my fave comedians and I wish I would have liked this more but honestly, I found some of the jokes to be corny and just not something I would have included in this book.

If not, one could be in for a rude awakening. Carlin is known for being outspoken on very controversial subject, least of which is religion. One must also be aware that Carlin uses language that can be very offensive to many people. Some of his less offensive remarks are: I tried to give up heroin, but my efforts were all in vein. You rarely run into a damsel anymore. Most people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, and a lot of them are really good at it. I can never decide if \u201cwhat\u2019s-his-name\u201d should be capitalized. There are many more musings like this in the book, many touching on subjects like death, abortion, war, and sexuality. If you like comedy and don\u2019t mind stuff that\u2019s off the wall George Carlin is your kind of comic. I must admit that I much prefer his live concerts than his books, although a lot of the materials for his books come from his concerts. ...more I've been a fan of George Carlin for the longest time and have watched his skits countless times.

Although I will admit to laughing out loud and drawing some stares during my commutes to and from work. What did surprise me about this book was that I found myself, on a number of occasions, actually offended. When watching a skit, I know George is putting on a show and doesn't actually mean lots of the things he says. But when you actually see some of these hateful words on the printed page, they are quite jarring. Just goes to demonstrate the power of the printed word. Perhaps that was what George was shooting for. Miss you George. ...more I needed something to cleanse my palate after two novels set during the Holocaust. This did the trick. While George Carlin is eminently funny, I noticed the same problem with this book as I did with Stephen Colbert's book. That is, comedians who make their success by playing off a live audience do not translate well to the static written word. The whole point of a comedy routine is to interact with others, soliciting reactions and feeding off of them.

Listening to Carlin read his book was the same as listening to Colbert read his: it sounded like a guy trying to be funny in an empty room. It sounded a little pathetic. Also, if you know Carlin's live stuff, then you will notice a distict reduction in energy level, timing, and punch as he simply reads into a microphone. There's a little bit there, but it's just not the same as his hilarious live performances. Still, the guy's an absolute riot. You can't go wrong with Carlin. ...more I'm a latecomer to Carlin but, like most great artists, sometimes you don't appreciate something until it is gone. This bathroom friendly book was great for short spurts as I read other, denser things when I had my little time.

After watching some of his specials, I realized he is putting his best stuff in the book so people who are ALREADY INTO Carlin might not appreciate reading what they've already watched or heard. Truly a genius, Carlin, whether on the page, in the iPod or in the concert hall, is worthy wherever and whenever. ...more warning: this review IS biased. I will admit that outright. I love Carlin.

G ...more If you're easily offended, you won't like this. I happen to like George Carlin and his irreverence and fearlessness. He doesn't care if he offends people, which is actually refreshing. Of course, he includes his fair share of silly boy humor, such as bodily function jokes, but that's just what boys do. Parts of this book are really funny. There's plenty of food for thought in Carlin's talks. That's why I never thought so much depended on his delivery, until I tried to read instead of watching. I just can't summon up the energy to finish this one. Amazon.com Review Standup comic George Carlin follows up his dark-horse smash bestseller __ with another compendium of cranky meditations, cinching his reputation as the Andy Rooney of boomer hepcats. \"Road rage, air rage,\" Carlin rails. \"Why should I be forced to divide my rage into separate categories?

Most sentences in the book coul Amazon.com Review Standup comic George Carlin follows up his dark-horse smash bestseller __ with another compendium of cranky meditations, cinching his reputation as the Andy Rooney of boomer hepcats. \"Road rage, air rage,\" Carlin rails. \"Why should I be forced to divide my rage into separate categories? To me, it's just one big, all-around, everyday rage. I don't have time for fine distinctions.\" Carlin is not into the lengthy essay--he's a sprinter of the mind. Most sentences in the book could be lifted out to stand alone and provoke deep thought: \"How can it be a spy satellite if they announce on television that it's a spy satellite?\" Good question. \"Why do they bother saying 'Raw sewage'? Do some people cook that stuff?\" Yuck, but yes, Carlin's got a point. He can do an extended bit too, most memorably the transcript of Jesus on a talk show plugging his new tell-all memoir about the Trinity, Three's a Crowd . Carlin is funny, but genuinely angry and poignant at times: \"You live 80 years and at best you get about six minutes of pure magic,\" he says. Sad, but about right. And how did Carlin get into his line of business, \"thinking up goofy s---,\" as he puts it? There's a clue in one entry in this book: \"As of 1995 the number of people who had lived on earth was 105,472,380,169 ... it means that at this point there have been almost 1 quadrillion human bowel movements and most of them occurred before people had anything to read. These are the kind of thoughts that kept me from moving quickly up the corporate ladder.\" Thank god Carlin stayed low on the corporate food chain and high on his own utterly idiosyncratic ideas! --Tim Appelo From Publishers Weekly Politically incorrect comic and Grammy winner Carlin has shown no signs of burnout during a four-decade career arc as solo stand-up, TV writer and sitcom actor (<---B>That Girl; The George Carlin Show</---B>), with 18 hit recordings and 10 solo HBO specials, plus film roles (Dogma; The Prince of Tides). Living in L.A. and Vegas, he continues to take his act to stages across the country. Four years ago, Carlin's huge fan following kept his Brain Droppings on the New York Times bestseller list for 40 weeks, so it's no surprise he's back for another round of acrid and oblique observations on modern mores. He covers a wide range of issues from rape and religion to the homeless: \"There's no war on homelessness... it's because there's no money in it.\" And any topic is fair game: abortion, airport security, cars, funerals, language, organ donors, sports, technology, TV and war. On the latter, he says, \"Men, insecure about the size of their penises, choose to kill one another.\" Over 100 scintillating short pieces are interrupted by loony lists and hundreds of clever one-liners. The fragmented format and colloquial style of writing suggest that much of this laugh-out-loud book is drawn directly from Carlin's stage act. Several satires here (\"A day in the life of Henry VIII,\" a nine-page interview with Jesus, an avant-garde play program) indicate a different direction Carlin might consider for future books. (May 1)Forecast: HighBridge's abridged audiocassette and CD might lead some to peruse the book, which splashes in the wake of a massive Carlin retrospective (\"From Class Clown to Social Critic\") two months ago at the Museum of Television & Radio (N.Y./L.A.). With a 10-city author tour and national publicity, sales could equal those of Brain Droppings (700,000 copies).

If you like his comedy, you'll probably enjoy the book. He gets VERY dark in a few places, even more than in his usual routines. It's an interesting mix of humor, observations, and just plain oddness. If you're at all easily offended, don't even pick this one up. Nothing is sacred to Carlin's wit. (I need a shelf called \"not really funny.\") I laughed exactly twice while reading this book. And I don\u2019t think I giggled, snickered, or chuckled even once. I might have smirked a couple of times, but mostly I was not amused. I\u2019m pretty sure some of these same pieces were in When Will Jesus Bring the Porkchops? , which I skimmed through pretty thoroughly again recently. If I\u2019m right, I think that\u2019s cheating. No one should put the same schtick in more than one book.

I know certain authors of fiction use the same plot devices in novel after novel, but I think that\u2019s cheating too. Was George Carlin really a crabby, grumpy, angry guy, or was that just his comedy persona? He sure comes across as a curmudgeon here. I did not read every word in this book. The sports jokes bored me, and the rape jokes disgusted me, so I skipped those. But I did go from cover to cover, reading the parts that I found at least mildly amusing. I did enjoy \u201cInterview with Jesus\u201d (\u201cI even used acupressure. That\u2019s how I cured most of the blind people, acupressure.\u201d) and the sections called \u201cShort Takes\u201d sprinkled throughout the book. (I think Carlin is best in one to two sentences at a time.) I only had this book around because I got it off BookMooch to give to a friend. I don\u2019t really know why I bothered since my friend doesn\u2019t read, but what the hell, it\u2019s the thought that counts, right? ...more Read full review at: Review: Napalm & Silly Putty by George Carlin, the comedy legend http://thereadingarmchair.blogspot.gr...

George Carlin was a legendary comedian. Even before I started getting into stand-up comedy, which was actually pretty recently, I was aware of him. So when I started reading this book I was curious to find out what it would be like. Would his writing style be similar to the way he talked in his lives? Would his jokes be equally funny when they were written down and not performed? These were a few of my questions and I was delighted to find out the result. Carlin in Napalm & Silly Putty had a great variety of themes that he explored, many of them very typical of him, like the government, religion and death. The chapters didn't have a thematical connection most of the times but throughout the book there were several chapters with Short Takes and The Evening News. From these, Short Takes were my absolute favourite ones that included short jokes, many times one-line long. The writing style was unique. It resembled the way that Carlin talked, so almost all of the time I imagined him talking. Maybe I should try listening to the audio version of the book. But reading the jokes didn't take any of my enjoyment away, I was constantly laughing out loud. Besides, Carlin had this very characteristic way of expressing himself and he maintained it as it was, with all the profanities and the satirical comments. ...more While I have watched and listened to the great comic, I've never actually read one of his books before. Shame on me! I absolutely laughed my butt off (not literally or this book could also go in the self-help section **okay I tried some humor in memoriam). This book is laugh-out-loud, hold-your-side kind of funny. There were so many times I simply handed the book to the person next to me and said, \"You have to read this! Now! Stop what you're doing and read it now so I can turn the page and keep While I have watched and listened to the great comic, I've never actually read one of his books before. Shame on me!

There were so many times I simply handed the book to the person next to me and said, \"You have to read this! Now! Stop what you're doing and read it now so I can turn the page and keep reading!\" He's definitely raunchy and rude so if you're easily offended, Carlin isn't for you. I wish I could give a brief synopsis of content but it's just so random and stream of consciousness. If you like Carlin, you'll understand that. True, some of the book and humor is a bit dated today because it was published so long ago and some technology is changing at the speed of light, but that just makes it all the funnier. My favorite part was the airport section where everything is misnamed and how crazy the whole airline experience is. \"They mention that it's a nonstop flight. Well, I must say I don't care for that sort of thing. Call me old-fashioned but I insist that my flight stop. Preferably at an airport.\" I can only imagine if Carlin could see airports now. Section after section just reads like a rolling comedy routine. Now, I can't wait to read his other books! ...more Another hilarious read from Mr. Carlin. I had the unimaginable luck of having friends with good taste who owned this book so I didn't have to run around town searching the libraries for it (I live in Romania and we have pretty crappy libraries). I absolutely loved it! It was cut out of the same material as When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops? so I had as much fun reading this as I did the other one.

George Carlin was one of the most intelligent comedians of all time. Deep thinker (on cocaine, to add) and social critic. I saw him in concert at the State Theater in Ann Arbor and immediately fell in love. He will always be the \"Hippy Dippy Weatherman\" to me. Dude, I loved this book. It's like a joke book for me now that I'm an adult. Geezer rants and clever insights into human nature organized into a collection of George's brain farts. Pick this one up and prepare to lose faith in humanity while laughing out loud. I enjoy Carlin's stand up. Reading this boook seems to me to be a disjointed narrative of complaints and the humor didn't translate for me. Listen to Carlin on CD or watch him. That is far more enjoyable. His rant on golf courses being used to house the homeless is hilarious and there were quite a few moments I laughed out loud at his horrifying solutions to many problems particularly those involving politicians, elitist types and corporations. He's the greatest comedian to ever live. Inspired me to get up on stage and give it a shot. All of his books are basically his material and performances in book form. There are sections of just random thoughts. Its great. This guy was and still is the best. Took ages for me to read this. Every now and then I have to ponder and rethink my values and everything. Carlin was heartless sometimes, and ruthless. But he was honest, I think. Although not all of Carlin's witticisms agree with me, for the most part I was in a state of near hysterical laughter throughout this!! I needed a laugh or two or twelve!! I love George Carlin! He was the funniest man ever and this is one of his best books. Not consistently funny...but when it was, I was laughing out loud. Love,love,love him! Cracks me up! We lost a great comic when he died! I LOVE George Carlin. I cannot wait to get my hands on this.<---C>George Carlin</---C>", "Title": "Napalm & Silly Putty"},
