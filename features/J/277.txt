This is love letter to one of the hardest things we all experience: the moment that your idols become your peers, your parents become your friends The crown jewel of the Harry Potter series, \"Half-Blood Prince\" is one of the finest novels I've read in my lifetime. Having allowed us to watch Harry evolve and mature for so many years, Rowling finally lifts the veil, so to speak, humanizing the larger than life characters of not just Dumbledore and Snape, but significantly and achingly, Tom Riddle. This is love letter to one of the hardest things we all experience: the moment that your idols become your peers, your parents become your friends, and your superiors your equals, when you realize we're all in this together and that it is nobody's job to shelter you, and when, finally, you realize that people are absolutely human. Rowling's affection for her characters and her sympathy for even the most vile of her creations (<---B>the Malfoys and Voldemort himself</---B>) are at the heart of Harry Potter's lasting beauty and insight. Here, she explores her three most fascinating creations, and one wishes the story would never end. But it does, and when it does, Harry is faced with the same challenge that Rowling subjects her readers to: how much faith do you really have in what you've been told, and do you believe, at the end of the day, that good really does win out? A timeles classic.<---F> One of my favorites, ever</---F>. ...more \"Read Harry Potter!\" they said. \"It'll be fun!\" they said. \"Our childhood was built on Harry Potter!\" they said. WELL YOUR CHILDHOODS WERE ALL HORRIBLE. OMG WHAT IS THIS BOOK? WHAT IS THIS MESS I'M IN?? Excuse me, but that large salty lake where my life used to be is my tears . Yes, yes, this means I loved it. But SERIOUSLY. Nooooot okay. At the end there, especially, I couldn't put the audio down so I was wandering about my house in a blind daze listening instead. And because every human and their \"Read Harry Potter!\" they said. \"It'll be fun!\" they said. \"Our childhood was built on Harry Potter!\" they said. WELL YOUR CHILDHOODS WERE ALL HORRIBLE. OMG WHAT IS THIS BOOK? WHAT IS THIS MESS I'M IN?? Excuse me, but that large salty lake where my life used to be is my tears . Yes, yes, this means I loved it. But SERIOUSLY. Nooooot okay. At the end there, especially, I couldn't put the audio down so I was wandering about my house in a blind daze listening instead. And because every human and their fluffy poodle has probably sensibly reviewed this book, BAH. I'm just going to make a list of things I loved and things I didn't. My Intense And Passionate LOVES: \u2022 Harry + Ginny = yes. I was dubious at first. Like I think romance is NOT JKR's strong point...plus when she gets to a romantic scene she ends the chapter. HHAHAH. ADORABLE. (Not that I minded, I just...I think she's not good at romance.) But omg, there was that moment after the Quidditch match??? YUP. You know what I'm talking about. Excuse me, my heart just ran around in circles screaming and shipping. \u2022 Hermione: I adore her, but...I gotta admit, she was a little bit too stuffy. BUT I STILL LOVE HER. I love her love for learning. \u2022 I also adore how sensible Ginny is. \u2022 Fred and George's joke shop gives life. Also death, probs, but liiiiife. \u2022 I am utterly in LOVE with the whole concept of Hogwarts. I mean, I think it's stupid that they have to write with a quill and ink (can't they just enchant the quill to write for them?) and they seem to get an excessive amount of homework, BUT. It's all so vivid and detailed and it literally feels like Hogwarts is A REAL PLACE. I totally get why people wail about their letters going missing. \u2022 Speaking of detail...me likey. I always felt inside the story. \u2022 Plus the audio book (narrated by Jim Dale) is GREAT. I totally recommend it. I think Hermione's voice had a tendency to sound like an insufferable goat, but I got used to it. Harry's voice was perfection. \u2022 I also particularly liked Harry in this book. I JUST LOVE HARRY. <3 He's snarky, but he's lost some of the angriness from bk 5. He's got snarky quips at the ready, but he's also intensely...good. Like he's just a really GOOD chap, who makes bad decisions but really means well. ZOMG. *flails about* He was definitely my favourite character in this book. \u2022 ALSO DUMBLEDORE WAS GREAT. I love Dumbledore and how he's always polite and kind and smiley. (view spoiler) [ CAN WE TALK A MINUT EHOW I'M NOT OKAY THAT HE'S DEAD?!??!?!? LIKE WHAT EVEN THE FLYING HECK OF BROOMS NEST TAILS. THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. BUT IT SHOULDN'T. BECAUSE NOTHING MAKES SENSE. Dumbledore. no . Come baaaaaaaack. *breaks down into a mess* I am also intensely furious that his weakening himself to get the horcrux was useless. MAD. Okay? I AM MAD. Character deaths where they failed are the worst there are. (hide spoiler) ] My Intense and Passionate LOATHES: (Hhahahha...you ready for this?) \u2022 Okay so, question: WHY do they sometimes go places and buy food...and sometimes they just magic it? Like Mrs. Weasely magics onion soup out of nothing for Harry. But in the next chapter, Harry and <---C>Ron</---C> are peeling sprouts. LIKE WUT. This makes no sense to me. \u2022 Why didn't Dumbledore pour the evil potion on the ground instead of drinking it? Just wannna know... \u2022 How the FLYING FRIKKIN BROOMSTICKS can anyone possibly convince me Snape is still on the good side? Because I don't even care. He can go abra kadabra himself to Timbuktu and DIE THERE THANKS. There is no repentance after this. I don't even care what the \"reason\" is in book 7, but Harry: you are an idiot to name your kid after Snape. \u2022 I HOPE SNAPE DIES. \u2022 DID I MENTION MY HATE FOR SNAPE YET??????? \u2022 Oh and another thing... I am so angry at Snape arghhhqqwqq. \u2022 Okay. Good now. I'm calm. Thank you. \u2022 HAHHAHHAHAHTE SNAPE. \u2022 Yes, I truly am calm this time. I'm good. \u2022 So . I also am fairly annoyed about Voldermort's (Tom Riddle) backstory. Because he read like he was straight out of a psychopath text book...which I found monstrously unimaginative. Attractive, calm, subtle bully, kleptomaniac, limited emotional reach, charmer, smooth...blah blah. Yes. I can just read a book about psychopaths and that's Voldey's description. I wish there'd been a little more ingenuity in there. \u2022 I really also dislike Ron. I KNOW. Travesty. But he's a bully! He was bullying first year's the whole time ...turfing tem off chairs, scaring them, bossing them around, taking stuff off them in the name of \"prefect\". Like how is that good?? How is that okay??? I will not forgive Ron for all this. And also the fact that he's a downright BRUTE to Hermione. How can I ship them when he's so rude and demeaning to her?? I DON'T. Hermione deserves better. And I don't buy the \"She completes him by sorting him out\" because I think all humans should take responsibility for their actions. Hermione shouldn't HAVE to force Ron into a better person and be his conscious. AGH. \u2022 Not shipping that. ^^ \u2022 Okay, I'm done. But just *whispers* I hate hate hate Snape. So basically YES, I had a fantastic time with this book. I loved the audio. I loved the story. I loved Harry and the world just feels so big and rich and visual. I get the intense fandom for this I DO GET IT. After being so angry and 1000% done in with book 3, I can successfully say I can't WAIT to read the last book now. And then watch all the movies. And then I'll finally be caught up, omg. Only took me like 10 years. ...more I was first introduced to Harry Potter in a Children\u2019s Lit class in college. I had resisted this popular phenomenon until I was forced to pick it up for a grade, and Book 1 was short enough that I could read it in the course of 2 hours. I have to admit I wasn\u2019t impressed to any extent, nor did I dislike the experience, but I was critical on grounds of its being derivative, even if reading the first led to reading the second. After all, if I was bored and looking for something light, I could do w I was first introduced to Harry Potter in a Children\u2019s Lit class in college.

After all, if I was bored and looking for something light, I could do worse than a fantasy about a child wizard who fights evil with his friends. But it was really the third book, with its increasing darkness, that took me in and made me a fan. With a movie coming out for Order of Phoenix and Deathly Hallows on the horizon, I decided I would reread Half-Blood Prince. I figured it would take four sittings, of course, with its 600 pages, but time does fly when reading this one, and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that this is my favorite so far. What I wouldn\u2019t have been willing to admit in college that I\u2019m perfectly comfortable saying now is that <---A>J.K. Rowling</---A> is a fantastic storyteller; she writes with great clarity, wit, and humor; and she\u2019s created a cast of loveable characters with whom most people, due to the common experience of growing up, can relate closely. That said, the reason for my preference for the 6th book is that it\u2019s the most emotionally rich in the series. Here we get the backstory of Voldemort (*spoiler alert*) through a series of flashbacks (coming in HP by way of magically extracted memories), and in this way, we come to understand the villain\u2019s similarities and differences with our hero. After all, the villain has to have reasons for committing heinous acts, and until now, we don\u2019t know what these are. Voldemort is from a once-powerful wizard family reduced to poverty that lives in a dilapidated hovel on the edge of a small town, wary of outsiders, and their main point of pride is their pure blood, the lineage having cross-bred for generations so as not to pollute the line. Voldemort\u2019s mother lives with her father and brother and yearns for the love of a nonmagical man (\u201cmuggle\u201d in this world) and when her father and brother are arrested, she uses the opportunity to bewitch her beloved and run off. She ends up pregnant, the man deserts her, and she dies while giving birth to her half-wizard, half-muggle son, thus making him an orphan (like Harry). (Faulkner anyone?) But whereas Harry comes to Hogwarts and befriends Ron and Hermione creating unity and strength through positive emotions, Voldemort, when growing in the orphanage shuns other children, torturing them at times (without the awareness of adults) and stealing their possessions. What fuels him is his hatred of his beginnings, his mother\u2019s weakness at having died like a common person despite being a witch, and the \u201cmuggle\u201d blood inherited from his father. Over the course of his time at Hogwarts, Voldemort, charming as only evil can be, learns to win over people as a means to an end and disguise his insidious purposes, but he never befriends anyone. He moves, through his hatred, further away from many of the emotions that drive Harry, namely the desire to protect the people he loves and avenge his parents\u2019 death. With Dumbledore\u2019s help in exploring Voldemort\u2019s past, Harry begins to understand that he\u2019s come to be where he is through the choices he\u2019s made, that his greatest strengths are an alliance with his friends, and that this might hold the key to destroying his enemy, a fact that\u2019s made all the more poignant when Dumbledore, in an all-out assault on Hogwarts by Voldemort\u2019s Death Eaters, is killed at the end. The stakes are higher than before, the action and pace increase as the conclusion draws near, and things are looking darker than ever, which is the setup that any fan wants when the end is looming and it leaves us with the question: How will our hero prevail? ...more i dont want to talk to anyone dont even look at me i was expecting it and i still cried for like 30 minutes Since pretty much everyone I know has read these books, I figure reviewing them is pretty pointless.

I'm not proud.... ...more It seems like by now, everyone would realize they should listen to Harry.. Such a sad end :( I knew that was going to happen before starting the series, but didn't know when. It still got me in the feels, though. The book as a whole was really fun and entertaining. I love the mystery and learning more about Voldemort. The romance drama was funny as well. I can't wait to see what adventures the next book brings and how it all concludes.. Re-Read in December 2014 for Harry Christmas To You This is DEFINITELY one of my top favorite books in the series. Shit just gets so real. My thoughts: -Dumbledore is so FREAKING sketchy in this book! He's so secretive, and he's always sneaking around, not explaining anything to Harry. -I'm always so proud of Fred and George for getting their own joke shop... I don't know what it is, I just feel like a proud mom. -ALL OF THE TOM RIDDLE BACKSTORY. THE GAUNT HOUSE. OMG.

That would make me happy. -While reading this book, there were about a hundred times when I was just amazed by irony at the whole Snape/Half-Blood Prince situation. (Harry is always going on about how great the Prince is and how terrible Snape is, etc.) I loved it! - \"Tom used to collect trophies,\" said Dumbledore, \"This will be important later.\" WHY COULDN'T HE HAVE JUST EXPLAINED HORCRUXES TO HARRY THEN? COME ON MANNNNN. -the fact that Voldemort went back to Hogwarts to ask for a job just.... is hilarious to me. I'm picturing a sort of weird looking Tom Riddle like \"plz. im evil but i luv hogwartz\" -when you find out that the Defence Against the Dark Arts job is actually cursed *thumbs up* - \"I love you, Hermione.\" RON ACTUALLY SAID THOSE WORDS. HE SAID THEM AND MY HEART SANG. He meant it in a friendly way but Hermione definitely loved hearing it. -Harry and Ginny are both so sassy and I love it when they become sassy together <3 -at the end when Hagrid said something along the lines of \"Dumbledore will be able to fix it\" right after Harry saw him die.... Saddest thing ever. This book and its movie are definitely up there on my favorites list. ...more hey, i posted an updated version of this review at https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co... !! the message i'm getting here is that you guys like when i like harry potter books.

If you\u2019re one of the two people on Goodreads who hasn\u2019t read this series, this review is not for you. So, my dear underside-of-a-rock-residing friends: This review will be interesting, because this book was far (far, far) from perfect, and yet I am utterly determined to give it 5 stars. (Which I have only given to the first book in this series.) God, how do you talk about this book? It\u2019s really amazing. It is really hard for me to feel anything while reading a book or generally living my life . For example, I felt nothing when Sirius died. Nothing throughout most of this series, actually. And nothing in this book, because nothing happened and everyone survived and everything is sunshiney and joyful! Ugh. I tried. The last hundred-ish pages of this book really tore me apart. Okay, even that\u2019s not true. I\u2019ll just come out and say it: I\u2019m really f*cking sad that Dumbledore died. I love him so much. He\u2019s high up in my top 5 characters. (Do I even have a top 5?) I\u2019m devastated, which makes me even more upset, because I have a life to live today and can\u2019t just lay around and wallow in fictional pain. I\u2019m going to move on in the hopes that I just. Forget. Because I don\u2019t like this at ALL. Here, we see Harry Potter - who, I think few will argue, has been a fairly mediocre character up to this point - become AMAZING. He\u2019s motivated solely by his need to work against injustice and evil. He realizes his parents\u2019 legacy within himself. He denounces the sucking up of others. He works hard in school! He is a good friend even when his two BFFS are being childish to one another plus refusing to believe him. In short, he\u2019s really, really, five-star-level great here. Gorgeous character development in 650 pages. I didn\u2019t think I liked Ginny much, because I didn\u2019t remember this book well...like, at all. But she is so great! So funny. I wish there was more of her in this book. Also, I\u2019ll fight anyone who says Dumbledore is ~the real villain~ of this series. He\u2019s really not. (Cough, Snape is, cough.) AND YOU'RE NOT EDGY, PEOPLE WHO HATE DUMBLEDORE BUT LOVE SNAPE. YOU'RE JUST DUMB. I fell deeply in love with the guy. (Dumbledore, not Snape. BLEH.) AND I F*CKING MISS HIM. Goddamn it. Trying to forget didn\u2019t last very long. Anyway. I missed Hermione and Neville. Hermione was absolutely not well-represented here at all. Maybe it\u2019s a good thing she\u2019s not a Ravenclaw (#RavenclawPride) because she works fully against logic throughout this book. And when she\u2019s not she just, like, refuses to believe Harry. Ron is soooooooooo annoying! Is he anyone\u2019s favorite character? He\u2019s like, Fred or George if one of them was totally childish and attention-starved and mean. In fact, Ronald is a pretty impressive character for the number of gross character traits he embodies despite being supposed to be a good character. Mean, immature, rude, jealous, definition of an inferiority complex. Bleh. Harry and Ginny I\u2019m totally for, BUT THE OTHER RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS BOOK ARE SO BORING. Can we do Hermione and Fred instead? Ron and Luna would be cute. Or, God forbid, some LGBT representation? WE KNOW YOU\u2019RE A SUPPORTER, JOANNE. Don\u2019t even get me started on Lupin and Tonks. Speaking of supposedly-good characters\u2019 downfalls: I\u2019m no longer a Hagrid fan. It started with the last book and came fully around here. Like, at a certain point, the man needs a character trait. Liking weird animals, making bad food, and being humongous don\u2019t count. Harry and Hermione\u2019s constant stubbornness is annoying. Plus makes the plot repetitive once in a while. Also, Tonks. You know what, I guess I AM going to get started on Lupin and Tonks! She was a hilarious badass in the last book, totally depressed and weak in this one. I know I sound like a total emotionless asshole here, but that\u2019s who I am, and she\u2019s annoying in this book. AND IT\u2019S TOTALLY FINE BECAUSE SHE\u2019S JUST BEING A SPINELESS IDIOT OVER SOME DUMB SHABBY MAN. Kill me, please. Then I can see my beloved Dumbledore again. Too much Snape. (Cannot WAIT to write the rant on him.) Too much Draco. (Why do people romanticize that little weirdo so much? I guess I get the temptation, but he\u2019s a bully at best and a spineless traitor at worst.) I hate Kreacher and I hate Dobby...I hated Winky, too...I might hate house elves. If that makes me racist against a species of fictional character, SO BE IT, I GUESS. I miss Fred and George, and the fun people from the Order (if they existed), and Hermione and Neville aren\u2019t here nearly enough. The price of Harry\u2019s amazing and concise character development is WAY too many bad characters, not nearly enough of the good ones. EXCEPT DUMBLEDORE. UGHHHH. I\u2019M SO SAD. (I think my inability to cry is making this worse. Maybe if I just creepily sobbed in front of my roommate for a few minutes I\u2019d feel better. Damn you, my lack of emotions! Just kidding love you.) But I want to give this book five stars more than anything. It was so compulsively readable, more than any other book since the first for me. And it\u2019s the last book where our pals are attending Hogwarts. That makes me so sad. It\u2019s such a gorgeous setting and I\u2019m going to miss it so much. WHY IS THIS BOOK SO SAD?! If Deathly Hallows is any sadder I\u2019ll be seriously impressed. And also seriously screwed. And, okay, even though I was a harsh critic of these books...I\u2019m really going to miss this series. I\u2019ve been rereading it on and off (obviously) for three months, and it\u2019s been a fun ride. This is one of the greatest settings of all time. And since I\u2019m rereading it after 10 years, it\u2019s like saying goodbye twice. AND I HATE ENDINGS. Bottom line: Okay, THIS is my favorite Harry Potter book. (Anyone else\u2019s?) Unreal character development + tragic and lovely adieu to a gorgeous setting + ability to make me feel real, deep emotion + compulsively readable? An absolute dream. ----------ORIGINAL REVIEW--------------- Ron and Hermione's will-they-won't-they is a total snoozefest. I propose Fred & Hermione and Ron & Luna instead.

I have lost a favorite character that always made me laugh and smile. this character is Sirus Black. I even still can't get over his death. but let's admit it that maybe there's a death of character that we will never get over. *takes deep breath* okay let's talk about this book \u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u2605\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u3002\u2606\u30fb\u309c\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u3002\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u2605\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u3002\u2606\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u2605\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u3002 PHLEGM I have never liked Fleur Delacour very much since I first saw her on the book four and then I saw her again on the book four as Bill's girlfriend or Fiancee and I also laughed when Ginny called Fleur Phlegm. I also still don't how Bill fell in love with her but yeah, she is pretty but I thought Bill deserved someone better than her. I like Bill so much. he is so cool with his red long hair. maybe I didn't like Phlegm because I was jealous hahahaha okay it is not maybe, I was jealous. but look at this scene : ''E is always so thoughtful,' purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Bill's nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes and Ron thumped him on the back. ugh ... how could I like her if she acted like that?!? that was really annoying and Ginny also found it disgusting. Hermione and Ginny didn't even like her. but she changed my mind on the the end of this book because when Bill was attacked by ... that werewolf guy who bit Remus when he was a kid. Bill is no longer as handsome as he used to be but Fleur still loves him. she doesn't care about how he looks and I even thought she would leave him after he was attacked but she didn't and that time I changed my mind about her. She is the right girl for Bill, even though I am a little bit jealous hahaha xD Ron and Hermione I ship these two so much and I really really like Ron. Ron and Hermione are always funny. they always bicker about something and I think the first time Ron fell in love with Hermione was on the book four because he was so angry when he knew Hermione went to the Yule Ball with Viktor Krum and in this book Ron hurt me so much. He thought that Hermione kissed Krum and he was so angry and jealous because of this and he kissed Lavender in the common room that was full of people and it also broke Hermione's heart. Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose. I remember very clearly that I cried so much till my eyes were red and puffy and that time I kept saying that I hated him and I didn't care about him but saying that seemed useless because I kept crying and crying. That time I wanted to hurt Ron's heart too, I wanted him to feel the exact pain Hermione felt when she saw him kissing Lavender. 'Er - my - nee,' croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them. but all my anger was gone when he was poisoned and he said that while he was asleep. I think he was trying to say Hermione, so that meant he dreamt about her and I forgave him that exact time and he also didn't really like Lavender anymore since then. he even pretended to be asleep when Lavender came to visit him in the hospital wing. so that meant he didn't like her anymore and I don't think he actually liked Lavender before he was poisoned. I think he just kissed Lavender because he wanted to make Hermione jealous and feel hurt, which he successfully did. Harry And Ginny have you ever thought why Ginny had relationship with quite many guys? wait ... not many guys because she just dated two boys, Dean and Michael. But she always got a boyfriend as soon as she split up with her ex and my thoughs about this is probably right because Ginny said this to Harry on the end of the book 'I never really gave up on you,' she said. 'Not really. I always hoped ... Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself.' I think Ginny always dated a guy as soon as she split up with her ex because she always tried to forget Harry, so maybe if she had a boyfriend, she wouldn't love Harry anymore. But according to what she said she never really gave up on Harry so that means she has always loved him. I was a bit sad when Harry said they can't be together again because Harry was afraid if something would happen to Ginny if they kept seeing each other. he was afraid if Voldemort used Ginny to get him. but I didn't angry with him because this just proved how much Harry loves Ginny and I am sure they will be together again. I hope so ... Dumbledore's death I admit that Dumbledore is not one of my top favorite characters in this series but I always found him funny and a bit weird, in a good way, of course.

Some of my favourite scenes (in no particular order): -Fleur and Mrs. Weasly falling into each others arms crying (just thinking about it makes me teary)(but no, really: Fleur is such an amazing and slightly underrated character. She lives with the Weasleys, where, honestly, no one makes it easy for her. Molly is fighting a constant battle with her but Fleur doesn't back off. Everyone is convinced she is vain and arrogant, but it's that moment in the hospital wing where - finally - these two amazing women recognise each other as equals, where Fleur gains acceptance and much more than that: respect. Everyone expected her to leave Bill for selfish reasons, no one expected that she really, truly loves him. But by proving that she would stand by him, whatever might happen - and everyone knew bad things were going to happen - she opened Molly's eyes and Molly saw her, for the first time, for what she really was.

He's come to tell you - well, I'll let him do it.\" There are some scenes however, that I do not like to read, where I have to stop myself from skipping them. Firstly, the dreadful second Quidditch match, secondly the Sectumsempra scene with Malfoy and Snape, thirdly Dumbledore suffering in the Cave. They are not very enjoyable. Something that will forever annoy me is how absolutely no one believes Harry's Malfoy-is-a-Death-Eater theory. He keeps telling Ron and Hermione about it but they ignore him. And then again, do you really expect me to believe that the brightest witch of her age would only get and \"Exceeds Expectations\" on her Defence Against The Dark Arts O.W.L.? Nope. Doesn't make sense. Especially not after Dumbledore's Army. In a nutshell: I love Harry Potter. Not sure I mentioned that before.

Like an ailing relative who knows they don't have much time left, trying to make the most of their remaining days. I would like to think that Albus saw Harry as a sort of adopted grandson.

Even though he was a fictional character, his death was still a blow. I remember reading fan theories about him coming back to life because his patronus was a phoenix, and I wanted to believe them even though I knew he had to stay dead for Harry to really become the hero he needed to be. ...more Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts. With Lord Voldemort on the loose things are going very bad in wizard community; all the troubles spill in the Muggle world.

Unsurprisingly the book begins with a chapter with real Muggle Prime Minister - somewhat unnecessary I might add. If you think you can find anything original in this review you are sadly mistaken. It is practically impossible to find anything new to say after literally everybody and their brother read and discussed the series. Still it was interesting to see some people try to pretend everything is fine and perfect (Hermione and Ron firmly fall into this category) while others like Harry being obsessed with suspecting other people - in Harry's case his suspicions of Draco Malfoy made him practically paranoid and acting retarded at times. Some spoilers follow. Is it still possible to find anybody who have not read the series or watched the movies? If you are one of such rarities, stop right here!!! Harry and Ginny romance came out of nowhere and feels very artificial. My old cynical self does not think Ginny is a good match for Harry. Why would anybody want to have a girlfriend whose only positive quality is to throw hexes around - for little or no reasons I might add? Hermione on the other hand was always there for Harry. Another complaint is fairly big and I will use spoiler tags for it. The underground lake scene: (view spoiler) [this came out really stupid for me. You had to drink the liquid to get the locket? You could not just reach it with you hand, fine. You could scoop the water with a goblet? Why not pour it out instead of drinking? (hide spoiler) ] Yet another big one: Snape (view spoiler) [Now that I know what is going on reading the second chapter I quite agree with Harry: he is probably the bravest man of the series. (hide spoiler) ] The tragedy at the end still feels like a read tragedy during the reread while the impact of what happened at the end of the previous book considerably lessened when I read it the second time. So all the nitpicks aside I still rate this book with a perfect rating; it is well worth it. P.S. I always wanted to say it in one of the reviews for a book of the series; this feels like a good place: when it comes to movies, Richard Harris beats the crap out of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. I am not questioning the acting abilities of the latter, but the former suited to the role much better. I leave you with the following: [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more ***WARNING: This review will contain spoilers that will not be marked so if you haven\u2019t read this book then I don\u2019t recommend you read my review.

I liked this book much more than the fifth and read it much faster. I have no idea why but I found many parts in this book funny. I laughed a lot more than usual when I read Harry Potter books. This book was perfect and amazing in every way possible. My second favorite character in the series is Draco and in this book, I felt so bad for him. He probably wouldn\u2019t have gone off to the dark side if his dad wasn't there first. It was obvious that he and his mother didn\u2019t want to follow Voldemort. When he hesitated to kill Dumbledore and was considering taking his offer of leaving the dark side I felt so bad for him. Also in the bathroom when he was crying really made me feel sorry for him because I don\u2019t think he would be all rude and mean if it wasn\u2019t for his parents and the way he was brought up. Harry and Ginny. To me, they should have never been a thing. I have always hated Ginny and the fact that Harry starts to like her annoys me so much. I hated her from the beginning and I have no idea why. I always wanted Harry with Hermione and not with Ron but my ships always crash. But then again Hermione is way too smart for Harry and Ron. Harry being with Ginny slightly rubbed off on me after re-reading this book, but keyword being slightly . Although, I still don\u2019t like Ginny and I don\u2019t think I ever will. I always disliked her since the beginning and I also don't think I will be completely okay with them together. This book proves that Harry Potter is an idiot and there was a reason he was never put in Ravenclaw. I mentioned this in my review of the first book but one day my friend and I were talking about HP and she told about how Harry is so dumb. First of all, Snape has been teaching him for 5 years. 5 YEARS yet Harry wasn\u2019t able to recognize his handwriting. I cannot understand how Harry could not pick it up. I mean Snape had been his teacher for 5 years and was writing in front of them yet Harry couldn't put two and two together. Hermione probably could have figured it out but she never read the book. Does he not pay attention at all? I mean you\u2019d have to never listen or read anything in class to not pick it up. After he finds this book, which has spells written around it, he thinks it's perfectly fine to start using them. This book obviously belonged to someone who was a dark wizard but yet he sees these spells and thinks \u2018oh nothing bad should happen I mean this book only was written by someone who was interested in the darks arts\u2019. Then he decides to test a spell on Draco and he doesn\u2019t even know what the spell does. I get Draco was trying to torture him with the Cruciatus Curse but there are still other spells he could have used to stop him. Then he tries to convince Snape that his nickname is Roonil Wazlib. Obviously, Snape won't fall for that. Don\u2019t get me wrong I love this series and I do like Harry but he is so stupid. I enjoyed this book a lot and found it really funny. I feel like reading this book made me love the series more and I\u2019m not sure if that was even possible. I wish after finishing the series I can erase my mind and re-read the series. I am so excited to carry on even though I know what happens next. I want to wait for a little before carrying on to the last book because I don't want to finish re-reading the series. I don\u2019t want it to end becuase I\u2019m so obsessed with this series!!! ...more Spoilers for anyone who has never read the books or seen the movies.

He\u2019s been a shoulder, a rock, some form of hope to everyone who had the privilege to be a part of his life. Everyone looked up to him. The darkest wizard of all time feared him. Yet he never looks dangerous. He is always this calm, serene person with a smile on his face, entertaining us with his wise, often odd sayings. He never put himself first; always thought of others. And even after his death will he be a beacon of hope, of faith, of everything the good side represents. Professor Dumbledore, I will always be loyal to you. You will never be forgotten.

Rowling created scores of Luna Lovegood fans with hilarious and bizarre commentary from the most unlikely Quidditch commentator. * The effects of Felix Felicis. * We get a fascinating view of the history of Tom Riddle. * The major question of the book: Whose side is Snape really on? Amazon Review: The long-awaited, eagerly anticipated, arguably over-hyped Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince has arrived, and the question on the minds of kids, adults, fans, and skeptics alike is, \"Is it worth the hype?\" The answer, luckily, is simple: yep. A magnificent spectacle more than worth the price of admission, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will blow you away. However, given that so much has gone into protecting the secrets of the book (including armored trucks and injunctions), don't expect any spoilers in this review. It's much more fun not knowing what's coming--and in the case of Rowling's delicious sixth book, you don't want to know. Just sit tight, despite the earth-shattering revelations that will have your head in your hands as you hope the words will rearrange themselves into a different story. But take one warning to heart: do not open Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince until you have first found a secluded spot, safe from curious eyes, where you can tuck in for a good long read. Because once you start, you won't stop until you reach the very last page. A darker book than any in the series thus far with a level of sophistication belying its genre, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince moves the series into murkier waters and marks the arrival of Rowling onto the adult literary scene. While she has long been praised for her cleverness and wit, the strength of Book 6 lies in her subtle development of key characters, as well as her carefully nuanced depiction of a community at war. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, no one and nothing is safe, including preconceived notions of good and evil and of right and wrong. With each book in her increasingly remarkable series, fans have nervously watched J.K. Rowling raise the stakes; gone are the simple delights of butterbeer and enchanted candy, and days when the worst ailment could be cured by a bite of chocolate. A series that began as a colorful lark full of magic and discovery has become a dark and deadly war zone. But this should not come as a shock to loyal readers. Rowling readied fans with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by killing off popular characters and engaging the young students in battle. Still, there is an unexpected bleakness from the start of Book 6 that casts a mean shadow over Quidditch games, silly flirtations, and mountains of homework. Ready or not, the tremendous ending of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will leave stunned fans wondering what great and terrible events await in Book 7 if this sinister darkness is meant to light the way. ...more Am\u00e9 con todo mi ser este libro.

It is rather more quiet than the fifth, but contains some incredibly intriguing aspects. An elusive Draco Malfoy, a book containing the scribbles of the enigmatic Half-Blood Prince, and more information on the backstory of a certain Hogwarts student of old by the name of Tom Riddle. From a more objective point of view, I would not hesitate to say that this book was not as good as the fifth one, which has been by far the best in the Harry Potter series. Personally however, I may have enjoyed this one more. Mostly because there are few things I enjoy more than backstory. And while this series lacks a lot in many aspects, it does have a bunch of wildly interesting characters. Dumbledore and Snape are definitely among them. But above them all rises Tom Riddle. That being said, Dumbledore was by far my favourite character at the end of the fifth book, and he remains so at the end of the sixth. \u201dIt is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\u201d ...more First of all ,It's the less \"action\" book in the series, That's why many may get disappointed, But I see it's one important book for the character development and to wrap up the actual \"Task\" of how Harry should finish Voldemort. as at that book we learn more about his past also we realize secrets that the writer kept hidden-although gave some hints that proved it was there from the beginning-about what Harry's facing, The cleverness of showing the \"Horcruxes\" idea was there since the early stag First of all ,It's the less \"action\" book in the series, That's why many may get disappointed, But I see it's one important book for the character development and to wrap up the actual \"Task\" of how Harry should finish Voldemort. as at that book we learn more about his past also we realize secrets that the writer kept hidden-although gave some hints that proved it was there from the beginning-about what Harry's facing, The cleverness of showing the \"Horcruxes\" idea was there since the early stage of the books is remarkable. One of the things I adore about Harry Potter that it's set in the real world ,\"Our World\" ..the beginning of that book implant that concept.. that the events we're reading since book one is happening here in our real world,The Prime Minister scene/chapter is real amazing addition to the series,and it include most of the major events we witnessed happened at the Wizardry world through the previous books and how it affect our world. The characters get more complicated here at that book..as for Snape secrets reveal...shocking for some and relieve those who always mistrust him being in the good side.. Well plotted twist from J K -which won't stop twisting the plot cleverly specially in Snape's character- Also there's a depth in Draco's character that really serve the plot of this and next book. Then the guardian role of Dumbledore at Harry's life start to manifest at that book. Then the atmosphere of the life in the wizardry world -like the Diagon ally scene was darker than ever. And there's also the romance which is increase at that part due to the coming of age. You'll love the Hermione-Ron relation.

Everyone is just that little bit sassier and hormonal which is very enterta This book has to be one of my favourites in the series, if not my favourite!!

I think this book has the best plot out of the series as it builds up to the end and really does keep you guessing throughout! The character development within this book is fantastic! Everyone is just that little bit sassier and hormonal which is very entertaining to read! Romione and Hinny kill me as they're just so \"ughhh\" and \"AHHH\" and do things to my heart!! I will never not get emotional when reading or watching this book/film because there's that one death which just simply ruins me!! I will never get over it. Never. One thing that irritates me is the fact that they didn't add all the extra information given in this book about the horcruxes or Voldemort's family etc into the movie! All the little details are so important and really add to the plot! I think that is why these books will always be my favourite, because yes the films are aMAZING but the books just have the little bit more and I will treasure them always... *hugs all my Harry Potter books* ...more My heart is shattering as I finish this phenomenal book. I was nervous to read it again because as it was my favourite the first time I read the series, I was anxious to see if maybe I would be let down. I completely understand why this was my favourite of the series, and still so far is. I connect the most with the characters and the feelings that they are faced with throughout this book. I am bawling my eyes out as I write this review, and with good reason. The death of Dumbledore is earth sha My heart is shattering as I finish this phenomenal book.

I completely understand why this was my favourite of the series, and still so far is. I connect the most with the characters and the feelings that they are faced with throughout this book. I am bawling my eyes out as I write this review, and with good reason. The death of Dumbledore is earth shattering, and the grave nature of this situation is delivered perfectly. This book is the darkest, I believe, of the series, as Voldemort's reign begins to take place. The fear, and frustration is eminent throughout every word; however, there is lightheartedness throughout. Delving into Voldemort's past is one of the unique aspects portrayed in this book. It's incredibly fascinating to learn the history of the darkest wizard of all time. There is so much we learn, and so much more we can guess about him, which is the sign of a great writer. J.K. Rowling allows the reader to figure things out on their own and take their own ideas from what she gives. It is impossible to lose interest as you discover more and more of this story. However, the biggest and most prominent reason of why this book speaks to me so deeply is because of Draco Malfoy. This is his story, his book, no matter how many ways one can look at it. He is so complex, very smart, troubled, hurt, confused, misunderstood, but nevertheless, strong in his beliefs. He loves his family and will do anything to protect them. Something that I didn't notice the first time I read the books, which I can see now, is that Draco is skilled at hiding his thoughts from intruders, which means that he is skilled in Occlumency. I adore him and it's crazy how one can learn so many things about their favourite character that they didn't know before just by paying attention to detail. This chills me to my core. I connect with him on so many levels, and although this is odd to many people, because they see him as a villain, he is not, and I truly respect him with everything I have. He knows love, perhaps more than even Harry, as he is willing to do what it takes to protect his family. He deserves a chance, just like so many others, as there are many layers to his character. There is so much that I can say about him, but I will keep it at that. I will always cherish this story with all my might. This book destroys me in the best possible ways. ...more OK. I'm prepared to admit I've read it. As someone once said about Jeffrey Archer novels, it's rather like a packet of stale chips. You keep taking them out and eating them, hoping that the ones at the bottom are little better. But they're not. After a while, you notice that the bag is empty, and you feel rather disgusted with yourself. She claims the whole story was planned from the beginning. Yeah, right. Though, to be fair, she's in good company; Proust said something similar about A La Recher OK. I'm prepared to admit I've read it.

He didn't come across as very credible either. _________________________ If you still don't believe me about the links between Proust and Potter, look here . If that doesn't convince you, I give up. There's such a thing as being too sceptical for your own good. ...more Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter #6), J.K.

This book is cold. There is a tinge of bitterness and melancholy since the beginning, really; you can feel it while reading, some parts even make you feel sad.

There is no safe place anymore, Harry Some books instantly remind me of winter, this is one of them; but it is much more than the fact that I started reading this one next to a wood burning stove, covered in blankets. This book is cold. There is a tinge of bitterness and melancholy since the beginning, really; you can feel it while reading, some parts even make you feel sad. What happened at the end of Order of the Phoenix brought with it a promise of global change and it's almost palpable now. There is no safe place anymore, Harry can trust very few people and even some of those he trusted to be friends still refuse to believe what he says about Voldemort, even though there could not be clearer evidence of his return. Nonetheless, I absolutely enjoyed this book from start to finish; I love how Rowling changed the whole pattern of the books from \"summer time; Hogwarts; problems; adventures\" to a real quest to defeat Voldemort. Differently from previous books, on this one nothing of particular impact happens to Harry before the new semester at Hogwarts begins. The only significant event that I can recall is Dumbledore using him as a human magnet to attract a new, supposedly , Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. So we are introduced to Slughorn, which I liked from minute one. In my opinion, he is one of the most believable characters that Rowling ever created. Most of the wizards (not considering Harry, his friends and the majority of the Weasleys) display a certain stoic behavior; some of them, like professor McGonagall, for instance, don't even express much emotion during the entire series. Slughorn, on the other hand, is a Russian roulette of conflicting emotions since his introduction. He feels proud of most of his acquaintances, ashamed of some, afraid of others. He feels attracted to the opportunity of being a teacher which would allow him to meet even more talented people, but afraid of what impact the exposure as a teacher would make in his life now that the world of wizards is being set upside down. Well, after this events, Harry is sent to the Weasleys', where nothing really meaningful happens. Then we have the customary travel to Hogwarts, where some enmities are reinforced, we might say. I must say that the atmosphere at school is utterly different from any of the other books. Some students didn't even return to school, so afraid they were, which I don't quite remember happening before, even when the Chamber of Secrets had been reopened on book two. As soon as the semester starts, Dumbledore starts inviting Harry to private conversations at his office, so we start to realize what this book is really about: send normal school affairs to the dumps, let's investigate Voldemort's past so we might come up with some way to defeat him. I found it great how Rowling added rebellious teenager behavior to back up Harry not caring much about school anymore, focusing on his new found mission. It added a much more believable sense to the character and to the whole story itself. Anyway, during the whole book we get to know, through collected memories of people who interacted with Voldemort during some points of his existence, a lot of unimaginable and priceless information which helps us understand what drove him to become what he is now: a monster. Setting Harry's mission apart for an instant, I would like to mention how fun some parts of this book were, due to the tinge of \"sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll\" that Rowling displayed. There are constant love conflicts, hormones are exploding everywhere; even Hermione, which I could never guess cared much about people, was found crying in the corners, feeling alone and betrayed. Again, giving young wizards a little bit of \"muggle\" adolescence hell was very well done in the sense that it makes the story much more believable. As the story goes on, Dumbledore and Harry get closer and closer to uncovering Voldemort's deepest secret, which leads them to go outside Hogwarts in search of evidence. Unfortunately, the results of their little adventure are disastrous. Getting advantage over Dumbledore's momentary absence from Hogwarts, the dark forces find their way into the castle and things get really bad. Rowling is not afraid anymore, so the signs of her advanced \"George R. R. Martin syndrome\" are firmly displayed, which makes me take a star out of this book. The ending is bitter and sad, setting a clear path to what we can expect on the final book. Interesting quotes that I didn't include in the review: It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right. ...more Blog Review: https://passthefeels.wordpress.com/20... The Half Blood Prince is yet another incredible installment in the Harry Potter series, but you all knew that already. It may be my favourite so far, in fact yes I believe it is, even though the emotions are so real right now. (I know I said Order was my favourite so far, but this one has overtaken it) I once again, loved every minute of reading this. It was perfect, and also had me lol'ing throughout the whole thing..eh, mostly. not the end. Th Blog Review: https://passthefeels.wordpress.com/20...

(I know I said Order was my favourite so far, but this one has overtaken it) I once again, loved every minute of reading this. It was perfect, and also had me lol'ing throughout the whole thing..eh, mostly. not the end.\ufeff The school and classes scenes were also amazing, that's weirdly one of the things I love most about these books. Hogwarts just being Hogwarts. If I'm being honest, weirdly again, the Quidditch scenes sometimes \ufeffbecome a little tedious to me sometimes, but I even loved those in this book, they were just so funny. Thankyou Liquid Luck. (\ufeff\ufeffthat was amazing, hahaha) The Apparition lessons were also a great laugh! J.K. Rowling is brilliant in everything she does; the humour, suspense, mystery... I mean, she even had me guessing and confused even though I've seen the movies a billion times. I loved getting to delve deeper into the motives and life of Voldemort, it was just so interesting to learn about his past, and what makes him such a complex character. As well as seeing the relationships, or lack of, with him and other people. The love aspect of this book, oh the loveeee, was so cute to read about. I mean, between Ron and Hermione, and Harry and Ginny, how could it not be good? You could really see them growing up throughout this novel, which I also enjoyed. The relationship between Harry and Dumbledore grew even more in this book (which made the ending that much harder) I've always loved reading about the dynamic between those two. Such a bond. Malfoy, well he was such an interesting character in this one, right from the moment when he stepped on Harry's nose *wince*, that was intense. It was so cool to be able to read about the mystery behind this guy, and try to figure him out a bit more. Draco has always fascinated me, which is probably half to do with Tom Felton, let's be real. Snape, uhm, I'm still kinda confused where I stand in regards to if I like or don't like him, at the moment it's a bit of both. I guess the Deathly Hallows will help me out, but I do really enjoy reading about Snape, even if he makes some...questionable decisions. Can't forget to mention Slughorn! He was a great addition to the story, I really enjoyed his character, and all that he brought to the novel. Once again, the friendship between Ron/Harry/Hermione warmed my little heart, and also tore at it a bit over the course of the novel *cough* thanks Lavender *cough*. But they never fail to make me smile. I feel like even though there was still a bit of it, the angst levels were much lower in this one, haha. Also, how can you not love Fred and George? I adore those two, they're like me in twin boy form. All-in-All, this was yet another solid addition to this amazing series, and it's just incredible how much more I'm getting out of the books than the movies, I really didn't expect to learn this much. Admittedly, I didn't even truly know what a Horcrux was until this book...oops. Can't believe it's time for the final journey... ...more", "Title": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"},
