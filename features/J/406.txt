{"Comments": "I have never wanted to slap a protagonist in the face as much as in this book! I also liked Ellen's mention of banned books and how all it's doing is hiding reality we should be learning from. Kids reading this book might actually get the crap scared out of them enough to stay the heck away from drugs! Yet, some prefer to make sure their kids are blind to the realities of our society? I rather read this to my child than have them star in their own story like this because they don't know better.

In this follow-up to Kristina's sordid tale, she continues to chronicle her life with the monster (crystal meth). After being kicked out of her house and denied access to her son, she finds herself at the mercy of the monster. Juggling several \"boyfriends\" at a time, Kristina recognizes that what she's doing in wrong, but is reactive as opposed to being proactive in terms of her addiction. The story is sad; she becomes embroiled in dealing meth and and contemplates prostitution. Readers can't help sympathizing with her regardless of all of the messed up choices she's made. As with the first book, I was mesmerized at Hopkins' narrative. She's able to construct a linear narrative out of a series of concrete poems where readers become entangled in all of Kristina'a dilemmas. The tale is disturbingly beautiful,<---M> emotionally jarring</---M>, and elaborately constructed. I've never read anything like this before and I am hooked.

This round is a whole lot grittier than the first one--heavier drug use, a ton more swearing, and a ton more sex. More drug dealing, with a stop-off at a whore house, as well. Definitely not a pleasant story, and I'm a bit surprised to see the publisher intended these books for ages 14+! Hopkins seems to have forgotten a major plot point about Hunter's parentage--she seems to have decided in this book that the real father doesn't know, but in the last book it was clearly stated that he did know. Confusing! It had been a few years between the two books that she wrote them, but those kinds of plot holes always niggle at me. Overall, though, it's a very well-done story (once again, in wonderful verse format) about the dangers of heavy addiction and the ruining effects it can have on your life. Kristina is kicked out of her home, away from her baby, all because she can't shake the addiction. While these books could definitely read as anti-drug propaganda, Hopkins really does a good job of balancing the \"drugs are bad\" message with story, characters, and her great verse. Definitely one that got under my skin as I obsessively read it! ...more Initial reaction: I'll have to think about how I'm going to write the review for this book, but it'll be a sizable one.

This book is like watching a car crash you can't stop until it's too late to reverse, no matter how much you want to yell at the driver \"For the love of all that's holy, please STOP.\" Only thing I can say was that watching Kristina's descent was heartbreaking, and probably for more than one angle of it all. 4.<---F>5 stars overall though</---F>. Laura Flanagan's reading of the audiobook was fantastic, and as difficult of a read as it was, it gave me so much to think about in the end of it all. Full review: \"You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness Like resignation to the end, always the end So when we found that we could not make sense Well you said that we would still be friends But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over.\" - \"Somebody That I Used to Know\" - Gotye Thought it was appropriate to quote these lines from this song since it was in my head as I started meditating over my thoughts about \"<+++>Glass</+++>.\" I'm still shaking and a bit misty eyed even in the aftermath of reading this because - watching someone fall this hard while in a seemingly endless cycle of addiction to drugs is not easy in any measure, whether in fiction or in real life. I think <---A>Ellen Hopkins</---A> captured the emotional journey rather well, on more levels than one. \"<+++>Glass</+++>\", the second book in the \"Crank\" series, is still very much Kristina's story, though I'll admit I liked being able to have a dimensional viewpoint of how Kristina's actions/decisions affected others around her and being able to see that in the context of Kristina's voice and mental bargaining. When we last left her, she'd endured quite a bit in her addiction to the \"Monster,\" made and broken many connections in the process, but had started coming to terms with the aftermath of events and her initial addiction in some capacity. But if the last book had something of hopeful note in certain considerations, this book completely blew that possibility out of the water with its revelation of events. What made this journey most powerful for me was how well this novel provided several dimensional views of Kristina's psyche. On one hand - we see the irresponsible, yet insecure 17 turning 18 year old that she is - having survived several series of ordeals from \"Crank\" and navigating a measure where she's searching for...something. Whether it's love, acceptance, a life, a future - possibly all four. These views of her character are rare in the narrative, but they provide a really potent insight on the tug-of-war that's going on in her head as well as a humanizing of her character that's honestly rare in comparison to other narratives that would try to profit off the emotional baggage the conflict entailed. On another, Kristina is seriously hard to follow and sympathize with because of her actions - between the increasing distance she puts between herself and her family, her irresponsibility around children (whether her own child or others, and that was one of the things that made me angry as I read this - more on that in a little bit), her addictions, her quickening temper/recklessness, and just the overarching moral descent where she'd do anything to get her next \"hit\" or establish her life where it's just coasting the surface for the moment - nothing permanent, mostly temporary gratification. I said in my initial notes that reading this book was like watching a car crash where you can't do anything but watch it as it unfolds. I knew that either Kristina would have to stop herself or something/someone would stop her eventually, and the aftermath would be a bitter pill to swallow. I'm not going to spoil which route the story takes in case people want to read this series for themselves, but while I was surprised by how it reached that point, I wasn't surprised that it'd go the route it did. Too many times people who are addicted to something tell themselves they will stop only to get lost in the clutches of it, to the point where desperation takes over and they'd do anything within it. Hopkins's prose not only weighs Kristina's perspective, but the reactions of the people who were around her - which broke my heart. I mean, watching Kristina's family endure one too many tests of patience with her was one thing - particularly with the increasing deception and upsetting justifications that Kristina employed. Her increasing distance from her baby was another difficult measure, with the precarious situations she put him in as well as other children (she ended up being a sitter to one of her guys who was dealing/using with her - those scenes were very hard to read). While Bree's mention wasn't as frequent as the previous novel, Kristina's bold and crude alter-ego was still very front and center, taking the reins and showing the darker parts of Kristina's personality and increasing need for the more potent drugs she's come across. This book also deals with unresolved conflicts Kristina has from the previous novel in her relationships (reunion with the father of her child, etc.) I was left with much to think about at the end of this novel - long story short. The poetic styling of this wasn't as easy for me to tell as the last book, but I thought Laura Flanagan did an excellent job on the audiobook reading, particularly with the inflections of emotion and enunciation she gave in the process. It was ultimately why I ended up liking the listening experience as much as I did. This book touches on several tough conflicts, including drug use, rape, sexuality (incl. GLBT relationships, though it's not a prime focus of the book and I did have some issues with the character's inner voice for some assumptions there). I appreciated some of the unflinching insights in the narrative. The ending has something of a similar tone as the first book, and it does leave the possibility of another expansion on the storyline. I will say that certainly this is not a light read by any means. It hurt to watch, but I felt with the way the characterizations, interactions, and events were portrayed, it immersed me in the story and gave me so much to think about in its aftermath. Stories like this happen all the time, probably more often than people realize. Not everyone can get the help they need, the relationships that are in one's addiction are fragmented, messy, and complex, and I respect the fact that the portrayal was raw and very real. I'm definitely looking into more of Hopkins' writing, and I did appreciate and respect the insight of this read.

Clean for a couple months, she starts craving \"The Monster\" and looking for ways to get it. The path back to glass also leads to dealing, a new love named Trey, and ultimately major trouble with her family and the law. Written in verse, Glass is a sad, poignant, and guiltily fascinating depiction of a \"normal\" girl unraveling her \"normal\" life, and descending into a truly dark, crazy, and perhaps inescapable world. ...more Wow. I don't know what else to say about this sequel to Crank, another favorite of mine. Ellen Hopkins has once again managed to blow me away. There were so many unexpected twists and turns in Glass, and I can honestly say that every single page held my complete attention.

Thus, it will also be very brief.) It's a common thing for books to have what is dubbed as \"second book syndrome\". Glass is the complete opposite of a book with second book syndrome. With a plot that builds upon the first that inexplicably draws you in to check in with Kristina and the monster, Glass is an experience to read, as it's predecessor Crank was. Both of them (and all of her books) have outstanding writing and a roller-coaster like plot. 1) The Plot As this is the second book in a trilogy, and if you're like me and a spoiler magnet and someone who detests spoilers, I will not go deep into the synopsis. If you are not human and don't care about being spoiled, here is the synopsis: (view spoiler) [ This takes place right where Crank ends with Kristina/Bree giving up her addiction to have her baby. And then she starts getting tempted again by the monster and this book is about her return to the monster. (hide spoiler) ] The first book Crank was about someone who had the perfect life getting destroyed by her newfound addiction to crank and her eventual downfall. And as stated in the previous review, Ellen's daughter also had an addiction to crystal meth so Ellen really understands things. 2) The Main Character As also stated in the previous review, Kristina/Bree is the main character. Just to clarify, she's not schizophrenic; it's just a facade she wears when the monster gets in her system. And I pictured her as Taissa Farmiga. 3) The Writing You should know by now how much I love her writing, but if you don't, I LOVE her writing. -\u201cBut how do you tell your heart, \u201cNo, don't swell with magic, you'll only burst?\u201d How do you tell it to clamp itself off from possibilities? God knows I don't need more pain in life. Why did I invite it in? Do I have to feel pain to believe I feel anything at all?\u201d -\u201cSix months since we met up again we are inseparable, an intricate weave. No longer do I believe this is a temporary fling. More like total commitment. More like I have walked down the aisle, holding hands with the monster.\u201d -\u201cI have to tell him how much I miss him when he's not here. So I snug my face against his pulse in his neck. \"I love you\" I wait, barely about to breathe. He tightens his arms around me. \"I know, and how lucky that makes me.\" I watch him go, wondering just what the fuck that meant to me.\u201d 4) Overall Thoughts She's a goddess. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605/5 stars!

Kristina's serial has the reader often times wishing they could knock some sense into her, and help her get back on the right path. Man... Do I just want to give her a hug. The plot and the pacing of the book is pretty slow, but the reader gets hooked because they want to know what happens. And believe me, I will pick up the 3rd book and finish this series. This book broke my heart and broke my soul. This book is not a light read. It is full of drug use and full of themes that are for very mature audiences. None the less, I hope people will read this book and take the message to heart, and see the harm drugs can do. Because this book nails it. ...more After I was done with Crank, I learned that there was a sequel to it. The name is Glass.

She loses her child; she gets raped multiple times, and has not had contact with her family in over a year. It always seems like she gets into a situation every time she makes a deal. This book is similar to Crank, along the lines of what you learn from the story. If your wondering what drugs are out there and how they mess you up, this series of Ellen Hopkins books are for you. ...more I am almost at a loss for words because of the end of this book. And to be honest, the entire series, so far, has me either speechless, or emotional. Or a mixture of both. This is the second book in the Crank trilogy, and I am torn between feeling a sadness at finishing the trilogy, happy I'm starting a new book, dying to know what happens, but at the same time, not wanting to know what happens to Kristina. This is a series which has had me feeling every emotion possible, and even some emotions I am almost at a loss for words because of the end of this book. And to be honest, the entire series, so far, has me either speechless, or emotional. Or a mixture of both. This is the second book in the Crank trilogy, and I am torn between feeling a sadness at finishing the trilogy, happy I'm starting a new book, dying to know what happens, but at the same time, not wanting to know what happens to Kristina. This is a series which has had me feeling every emotion possible, and even some emotions which I feel guilty about feeling, but I can't help it, though. The first book, Crank, had me feeling just sad, all-around sad, because of Kristina's new friend and life. But also the circumstance which got her into this new life and her new friend, The Monster. I was angry, as well, because of that circumstance. Up until Glass, I didn't really blame Kristina, and felt like her problems were not really her fault. But now.... I want to slap this girl. I want to slap her so hard, she gets kicked out of her addiction. The ENTIRE time I read Glass, (Well, the first few pages are an exception), I blamed Kristina and angry with her, and NOT the person I blamed before in Crank. This time, the responsibility of her drug addiction is completely her own. It is amazing (I don't mean this in a good way), how much drugs can change someone. And change them for the worse. When you think it's gotten bad, it can get a WHOLE lot worse, and it does for Kristina. I feel like her mom, Marie, has gotten a bit stronger, and I really liked she has kind of taken a bit more control. Especially with something happening towards the end, I felt as though her mom grew to be a bit more respectable in my eyes. In the first book, Crank, I didn't have any respect for her. There are times where I felt like she enabled Kristina a bit, but in the end, for me, the story in Glass was all Kristina's fault. In the beginning, I really thought she had a great chance to recover, to change, and live a better life. Apparently, I was way wrong. So wrong in fact, it shocked me a bit to see the lengths Kristina went to feed her addiction. I feel like I've learned a lot about the awful effects drug addiction has on someone. I could never imagine not caring about myself, my family, my friends, losing my family and friends, and just the whole scheme of it. I could never imagine not caring about what I put into my body, when meth is such a toxic, dangerous drug. What I've learned, has scared me. Scared me for the people who are hooked on it, scared me for the people who will become addicted to meth, and scared me for the children of those people. This story, these books, make me feel lucky I didn't get mixed up with the wrong people. They make me feel lucky I have people who care enough about me to push me towards the right paths, instead of the wrong ones. I feel lucky I have a good head on my shoulders and know better. I did come from a broken home, and with my mother not around, I could see how someone like myself could have gotten mixed up with drugs. But Kristina's story makes me grateful I am me and not her. ...more Sequel to Crank..

But she doesn't and apparently she hasn't hit rock bottom yet. She does a whole bunch of grade A glass/crank whatever and eventually gets kicked out of her house. Goes to live with Treys cousin. Who has a endless supply of crank! Yaaaa good choice... NOT! Then Treys cousin decides to quit drugs and introduces Kristina to the Mexican Drug cartel. NOT GOOD! She and Trey end up in a shit whole weekly motel, run out of money, steal blank checks from her mom, score tons of crank and tells Mexican Mafia she is good for it. And she bounces. Tries to flee out of town and heads for California with Trey. Cops find them sleeping in their car in a Mcdonalds parking lot with a ton of drugs, warrant for arrest. BOOM.... You go straight to jail. And guess what??? Oh yes it gets even worse!! She's pregnant AGAIN! And yes folks this book is fucked up. Moral of the story.... DONT DO DRUGS! It's that simple. Well this author did it again. This book is so addicting even though it is so messed up and traumatic to read. I could not stop reading it. Looking forward to the final book in this messed up trilogy. ...more Awesome! Haha, you can bet I won't ever be touching drugs. Not after reading this. Despite many recommendations from my classmates, I really don't like this series that much. It's not the kind of thing I obsess over. It's not that it's not a good series, it's just not my type of book. I can see why it can be appealing to so readers(it's based on real events in the author's life, a lot of teens can relate to it, and it is incredibly sad), but I can't seem to sympathize with the main character at all. One of the worst parts of this book was that it dragged and was slightly boring Despite many recommendations from my classmates, I really don't like this series that much.

One of the worst parts of this book was that it dragged and was slightly boring. Also, she was making such bad decisions, it was even obvious to her, and she barely even tried to change her ways. She just kept relapsing, and hurting the ones she loved. She couldn't even clean herself up for the sake of her son. She let \"Bree\" (her inner self who got her into this situation) take over and chose to get addicted to meth again instead of taking responsibility. Despite hating her incredibly stupid decisions, I didn't hate this book. It wasn't terrible. It can be an interesting read for some people, including me. It gives you an insight on how terrible that lifestyle can be. Plus, it's not a hard read because it's written in free-verse, so the book goes by fast, and it's written like how the author thought a teenager's mind would sound. There is a LOT of cursing, and it is a little graphic at times, so I wouldn't recommend this to some. To those who can handle it, and enjoy genres like this, I say try it. You might get more out of it than I did. ...more There has to be a third book, because this girl needs to die. I will not be satisfied until that selfish, dirty, deceitful bitch dies.

I really don't like Trey and was really rooting for her and <---C>Brad</---C> to end up together. I just thought that she and Brad had more chemistry and that he was a much better guy for her (even if he was a meth dealer). I was a little confused because I thought that Brendan knew about Hunter? I may be remembering wrong. But I wasn't the biggest fan of having him pop up again. I thought that Kristina was just a straight up b*tch to Heather for no reason and it kinda made me uncomfortable just how homophobic she seemed to be with all of her nasty thoughts towards Heather. It was a bit hard for me to imagine Leigh being okay with her sister acting like that towards her girlfriend. I was glad that her mom finally took some sort of stand against Kristina when she kicked her out because of her usage. And I like that she filed for full custody of Hunter because it was the first wake-up call that Kristina truly was losing her battle to her addiction. And this is going to sound harsh, but I was really glad that she ended up being arrested. I think what made me glad to read it is that this is aimed at a teen audience and I want them to see that they can do some serious damage to themselves. I know that addiction is a disease, but there are so many instances in pop culture where a drug user and/or dealer do not face many consequences and it ends up being almost romanticized. I hope that makes sense. Anyway, I think it'll be interesting to read Kristina's story's conclusion. I wonder what will happen with the proposed deal with the Feds and what will happen with her and Trey know that they are expecting a child. Especially since it was clear that Hunter was too much for Trey to handle. ...more Six months ago, I read Crank , a compulsively addictive YA free-verse novel about one girl\u2019s downward spiral at the hands of crystal meth. Crank , from 2004, put Ellen Hopkins on the map as an author.

Two of them are sequels to Crank , and there are three separate multi-title series. Busy lady, Ellen Ho Six months ago, I read Crank , a compulsively addictive YA free-verse novel about one girl\u2019s downward spiral at the hands of crystal meth. Crank , from 2004, put Ellen Hopkins on the map as an author. Since then, she\u2019s written a dozen books, most of them YA, all of them in verse, all with one-word titles, all of them ranging from like 500-700 pages, and most of them with tacky jacket art. Two of them are sequels to Crank , and there are three separate multi-title series. Busy lady, Ellen Hopkins. So anyway, I tried Crank , and I got hooked. Read it in one day. It was an emotional roller coaster, satisfying for the reasons intended yet also calculatedly scandalous in a Jerry Springer kind of way*. There was an undercurrent from the narrator and from me as a reader of, \u201cI should know better, but I simply can\u2019t help it.\u201d And Glass turned out to be the same way - six months later, I had very nearly forgotten the feeling I had reading Crank , but Glass brought me right back to that place, with only minimal depreciation. In the opening pages of Glass , the protagonista, Kristina, sums up the entire story of the first book with an \u201cof course you know about me, of course you remember my story\u201d approach. And yeah, really, if you don\u2019t know about her, read the first book first. There\u2019s no reason to start here. Months have passed. Kristina is sober, and she lives at home with her mom, stepdad, younger brother and rape baby. (You know when you do crazy amounts of hard drugs in a YA book, you\u2019re gonna have a rape baby.) This one\u2019s name is Hunter, and to his young mom, he\u2019s beautiful, wondrous, boring and annoying. Her meth addiction, quieted through the pregnancy and newborn stages, is starting to whisper at her seductively. You need to be more alert, you need more confidence, you can\u2019t organize your thoughts and act on them without me. You can just do a little this time and get only the benefits. You\u2019ll be in control. It won\u2019t be like before. And so on. Anyone who\u2019s struggled with addiction knows what that voice in your head sounds like. So Kristina gets back in touch with Robyn, a friend from school who used meth to curb her appetite and help her get her homework done after cheerleading practice. (I say this as a 36 year old who didn\u2019t know this 20 years ago, but how about trying some black coffee, kid? It works pretty well for what it is. And it's easy and cheap to get more.) The simple act of getting to Robyn and getting some meth requires Kristina to deceive multiple parties, from her parents to Robyn\u2019s brother to Robyn herself. All part of the cunning chicanery of the drug life. Once Kristina gets that taste of crystal, it\u2019s like she never left. And the crazy Ellen Hopkins-devised roller coaster is off and running. You know, if you\u2019ve read any of Hopkins' books, that extreme but frighteningly plausible horrors will soon start to arrive and escalate. But you strap in, you flinch, and you enjoy it. And, if you\u2019re lucky enough to have them and have them near, you\u2019ll be hugging your spouse and your kids at least once apiece before you finish. If you never have read an Ellen Hopkins book, you should pick one up, if just to see the page layouts. White space abounds, and there are six or eight frequently used templates. On nearly every page, though, she squeezes bursts of words to fit tiny predetermined spaces of different shapes and boundaries. There's a rhythm and discipline, but the end result doesn't read as being gimmicky. You have to admire the formal structure of it all, but it\u2019s also very accessible. Will I read Fallout , the third book in the Crank/Glass trilogy? Ask me in about six months. I mean, yes. Yes, I will. _ * = My new favorite Goodreads buddy, Jules Hucke , sums up Ellen Hopkins books perfectly with this laundry list: \u201cSomebody's always insanely in love, someone's always hurtling toward self-destruction, someone's having a BFF crisis, someone's parents are getting divorced, someone either is about to or just came out, somebody's addicted to something, someone's in a mental institution, someone was raped as a child, and someone either tries to or does kill themselves. Mix (and match) and let simmer on the back burner. Pull out characters as needed.\u201d ...more This book by Ellen Hopkins is one of my all time favorites.

She is living with her parents and has been off crank for awhile for the sake of her child. But, now that Hunter is born and is in the hands of her parents, she is ready to start again. It all starts with her going to an old friend, Robin. Kristina always used to drugs with her and get them from her. Kristina notices something different from when she has used crank before. Now, instead of powder it is little crystals. Hint from the title of Glass. Her first \"light up\" got her hooked. Now she cant stop, and she needs more. While she was at Robins she met a guy, Trey. They both really like each other and, Kristina can get more glass from him. They exchange numbers and decide to meet up again since they really like each other. About a month of smoking later, she meets up with him. They kiss and have and they get really close. As she got closer and closer to Trey the worst she got. Trey was her boyfriend and her dealer. Kristina's mom started to realize how bad Kristina was getting. She gave her warnings after warnings and it went right though Kristinas head.Kristinas almost missed her sons batism because of a party in Vegas, she missed christmas to be Trey instead of her family and her son. She went completly down hill. S, her mom kicked her out. Now she is living with Trey's cousin. A single father with two kids.

But her mother catches on, and rats her out. One night, they get pulled over and didnt just get a ticket. They got a sentence to jail. Trey, herself and glass in the car. The book ends with Kristina in jail, pregnant with her daughter autumn, and not to hear of Trey. This book is very good, and written in poety. Just like Crank. I deffinetly think that it is for teens 13 and up. It has rough language and some pretty bad things happen. I deffinetly reccommend this book to someone looking for a good poety book.I also think it is a good book because it shows teens what kinds of things can happen to them while on drugs.It can deffinetly scare people away from drugs, because it did for me. I feel it is a great book to see what could really happen. But you have to read Crank first to fully understand it.I really like all of Ellen Hopkins book that I have read so far.I also learned that Ellen Hopkins wrote that book based on her daughters ride with the monster. I never knew that was true and I feel like I know all about her life. I love the way this book is written and broken up. It was a really great book and it is one of my favorite books. ...more Reviewed by Sally Kruger, aka \"Readingjunky\" for TeensReadToo.com Ellen Hopkins has once again taken readers into the world of meth and the chaos it creates.

GLASS is the sequel to her first novel about Kristina called CRANK. Just several months after giving birth to her son, Hunter, Kristina is drawn back to \"the monster.\" She thinks a little snort could help her lose some weight and get her through the late-night feedings and day-to-day drudgery of constant baby needs. Surprised at how easy it is to score and how much the product has improved, it doesn't take long for Kristina to remember how great the stuff makes her feel. For awhile the teen mom is able to take care of Hunter, hold down a low paying job, and keep herself cranked just enough to pretend her life isn't all that bad. Despite what Kristina may think, her mother and stepfather, Scott, are not really fooled into thinking all is well. They give her just enough space to eventually crash and burn. After falling asleep and putting the baby in danger, Kristina's mother throws her out of the house. She says she'll take care of Hunter, and Kristina should take care of herself. Like most addicts, Kristina fools herself into believing she can have it all. She manages to keep her job and find a place to live with the cousin of her latest love interest. Once again her life is filled with drugs, sex, and whatever she has to do to survive. At times there is hope of reconnecting with family, but each time Kristina can't cope with their expectations and ends up with less and less of their love and support. For readers who followed Kristina's painful journey in CRANK, this next book will illustrate the power of meth to completely change and destroy a life and the lives of anyone connected with the addict. Hopkins speaks from personal experience, which creates a powerful, heart-wrenching, and all too real quality to her verse. As they say, it's a life you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy. ...more Drugs Can Definitely Ruin Your Life Glass Rating:4/5 Summary: Kristina has been clean from meth since she had Hunter, but her monotonous life is getting to her.

Soon Kristina is spiraling back into the claws of addiction. I love Ellen Hopkins and all of her writing is wonderful. However, this one didn't get to me as the others do. Maybe drugs aren't my thing really. I don't know, but Kristina kind of annoyed me. She knew what would happen when she went back to crank. It was only a matter of time honestly. It felt like she was throwing away her life just after getting it back. Yeah I get it, being an adult isn't always fun but she had responsibilities that she basically dumped on her mother. Poor Hunter. The plot of this was still gripping. I was hoping Kristina would realize how bad she was in and seek help. I gave up after the whole Brad/Trey deal. Even though I don't really care to read about drugs, Hopkins managed to keep me involved with all the new characters as well as the threat of being arrested and Brendan. He's a prick and needs to go to jail. The romance with Trey was super cute at the beginning, but I was transported back to my own memories with the whole not calling/long distance thing. Sighs. It's hard to leave people you care about. I could relate to Kristina a bunch with her relationship to Trey. Though (view spoiler) [ I didn't get engaged to my long distance ex (hide spoiler) ] .

Apologies. I was quick to run to the store and grab the remaining books in Hopkins\u2019 Crank series upon finishing the first book. I had to know where Kristina\u2019s story went, this isn\u2019t one that I am OK with parting from until I take in every detail of where her life goes.

I really feel like she became a real person in this novel and just as much as I enjoyed reading her tale, it was one that frustrated me to no end. See, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to base my review/rating off how I perceive the characters\u2019 actions because these are stories and what fun would stories be if the characters always did what was right in every situation. That being said, I was so very angry with Kristina for most of this book. She starts out as a new mom trying to get away from the monster and quite quickly she delves back into darkness and before long she\u2019s kicked out of her house and fighting to survive. For much of the novel I wondered if she even remembered that she had a son at home that she was supposed to take care of. Once again we get to go through some tumultuous situations with Kristina and see how everything affects her relationships. We see her mother come to the end of her rope and have to remove Kristina from her life and through that she basically loses her whole family. We also see her strive to find love in a partner and struggle to find what is real and who is in her life just for convenience. I didn\u2019t trust anyone that she met in this novel, talk about hanging out with the wrong crowd. But the lengths that she goes to and the people that she willingly brings back into her life are shocking. What really scares me about this series is it kind of puts the world of meth addiction right in your own backyard. Cheerleaders using it to improve their pep, college students using it to study for that upcoming test and even the poster girl with good grades slips into the grips of addiction. There is a little essay by Hopkins at the end of the novel where she touches upon the controversy surrounding her books and I have to say that I completely agree with her. Blindness to the issue isn\u2019t the answer when bringing up our children. As they say curiosity killed the cat, so I believe that being open and honest when children are curious about something is key to bringing up a generation of people who are informed enough to make their own decisions. This review has kind of turned into a rant, but just know that I hate this series for the story it is telling but I love it for the very same reason. Both Crank and Glass have made me angry, made me sad and made me really think about what situations my children are going to find themselves in growing up. -- You can read all of my reviews at Alluring Reads . ...more i just finished reading the book glass by ellen hopkins and it was a really good book. in this book the main character is kristina, she goes through a whole list of problems but she faces or tries to face all of them. in the book kristina has two different sides of her theres kristina and her other half, she calls her bree. bree is the bad side of kristina she takes care of her problems in a bad way. i noticed that whenever kristina lets bree out of her cage nothing good ever happens. i mean fi i just finished reading the book glass by ellen hopkins and it was a really good book. in this book the main character is kristina, she goes through a whole list of problems but she faces or tries to face all of them. in the book kristina has two different sides of her theres kristina and her other half, she calls her bree. bree is the bad side of kristina she takes care of her problems in a bad way. i noticed that whenever kristina lets bree out of her cage nothing good ever happens. i mean first she did drugs, then she had a baby but the baby wasnt with the guy she loved and she got pregnant through rape. she also has problems with her mom, her mom kicked her out of the house and she wouldnt let her take her baby with her becuase she knew she couldnt trust her with him alone, i mean she could barely even take care of herself. overall, i really liked this book it was a fun read. another thing that i noticed while reading this book was that kritina fall sin love really easy. i mean she was in love with chase, quade, brad, trey, brendan, and more. well, i dont think it was really love i just think she thought it was evn if it wasnt. i mean i know a lot of people can fall in love really easy at a young age. like what some people say, when your young your foolish and dont think right. i guess if somone puts it that way people would think kristina is stupid but, i really dont think she is stupid. what im trying to say is everybody makes mistakes and we cant really fix what we already did. (we cant go back in time and correct the things we did wrong/ or thought we did wrong.) in this book i also noticed that her family didnt really help go through any of this. i mean they yelled at her and told her to get help but they never really did anything about it. i dont think anybody was really supportive of her except for her friend quade, he was reallt the one who was and always will be the one who really cares for her in so many ways. in the end, kristina is pregant with treys baby and she knows for sure that shes in love with him. even though they are both crack heads who make wrong decisions it doesnt man that people can change. i mean for one they turned into what they are now and nobody knows what the future holds. if i were to rate this book i would give it 5 stars. i loved this book so much and i would definetley recommend it to anybody/everybody. ...more I think this book is geared to mature upper aged teenagers.

At the beginning of this book I actually thought that when, the main character Kristina/Bree said she was going to quit, she was going to, but I learned pretty quickly that she would never be able to leave the grasp of the monster. I wasn\u2019t very surprised when her mom kicked her out of the house and kept Hunter. She shouldn\u2019t have gone back to the monster after she had quit for about a year or however long it was that she resisted, but I guess that\u2019s what meth will do a person. However, I was surprised that her mom let Kristina come back in their life for a little while, especially when she let Kristina take Hunter for that one weekend. I think Kristina could have realized what she was missing back home and turn her life back around if she would have gone to her mom\u2019s for Christmas. I can\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t go to that. I also think that it\u2019s even more stupid that she messes up when she takes Hunter for that weekend. She goes into the other room and smokes, and just leaves him there all alone. You would think she would have learned from what got here kicked out in the first place. I really don\u2019t get why she went then after she got kicked out of Brad\u2019s house, and sold drugs herself carrying it around in her car. The other stupid thing she did was she was sleeping with two guys, and the worst part was that both guys knew she was sleeping with the other and she still kept on doing it. I also don\u2019t think it was very smart that she would take her mom\u2019s checks, or get a fake I.D. She should have just left her mom alone, and out of it. After all of that, she goes to jail, and on top of that, she finds out that she\u2019s pregnant again. She says she\u2019s going to try and quit, but like I said in the beginning, we all know how that\u2019s going to turn out. ...more", "Title": "Glass"},
