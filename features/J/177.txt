My dad, trying to keep the morality of four teenage girls intact, complained about movies always doing that, making you root for something you didn't believe in. I remember thinking \"it's just a movie; you're supposed to want that,\" because I had wanted it. Christopher is a smart woman. She realizes this power, that as an author, she can direct you in what you're supposed to want, who you're supposed to like, and what ending you're supposed to root for. And she uses it to mess with your head. Ty and <---C>Gemma</---C> are basically the only characters in the book, so you want them to end up together. Ty is a kidnapper and has a temper, but he's a kind, likable kidnapper. From the beginning, you want Gemma to get over it and like Ty. He had a sad life and has such a vulnerable quality and if only Gemma would love him it would make him all better. You see what Christopher does? She makes you, the reader, experience Stockholm syndrome, so that by the end you're as conflicted as Gemma about the outcome and about your own feelings of Gemma's resistance and Ty's culpability. She makes you consider Stockholm syndrome from the inside. That's brilliant. ETA: I have several friends who didn't like the book and it's made me think about why this works so well for some and not for others. It comes down to you. If you're the type of girl who'd want to protect a broken spirit then you'll fall right into the trap that is Ty's charm. If you like a man's man and have no patience for weak men, the book won't work for you. The book may have been more powerful had we fallen in love with a man who was a little bit rough, a little bit forceful, a little bit cruel and yet Gemma depended on him for her survival. But maybe not. It would have been more of a risk and may not have had the same longing for romance that this has. Either way, it still requires you the reader to pull off the full affect. It's a risk and sometimes it pays off. Sometimes it doesn't. ...more This book completely reaffirmed my fascination with the beautiful land that is Australia .

But the people who live there seem to want everyone to think it's a lot like this : Or this: Or even this: Gemma, just a regular 16 year old school girl, has been captured by a handsome and alluring young Australian man named Ty. Although Gemma seems to think so, it never feels like she's in any imminent danger, from Ty at least. From the environment - yes. The stakes and suspense don't seem that high, as I fully believed that he never intended to hurt her. Regardless, the author managed to draw me in with every single word. The story itself is incredible, as is the the writing and character development. I just worry that it's glorifying kidnapping. Cause really, how many child abductors are 20-something sexy Australian men with supermodel looks and a hot bod, who only want to be loved? If I was Gemma, I can't say I would mind. I mean, I picture him looking a bit like this: Whoopsie!! Not the right picture! That's from my secret stash... *blushes* Here the right one: But our girl is very stubborn and never seems to be giving up on getting away from him. She's resilient and strong and everything you expect the heroine of a young adult novel to be. And whew! The male lead character Ty, our captor, is really hot. Come on, Gemma. The scene with the paint where he leans in and asks (<---B>referring to the paint of course</---B>) \"Do you want some?\" I couldn't help but think heeeeeeeeck yeah. I imagine if any other girl in the world had been there, she'd be jumping up and down with her hand raised saying \"I do, I do.\" Ty is extremely charming and a bit of a paradox. He is multiple layered character, who although seems unsocial and outdoorsy, is good with words and can completely make you swoon. Though most of this is a result of brilliant writing, a lot it also comes from the talented narrator of the audio book. I know the book alone is amazing, but this one is really worth listening to on audio . It is the most well read book I have listened to in a long time, probably EVER. The voice of Ty isn't even noticeable as being read by a women. The narrator and the author are both on the exact same wavelength and both nail the complex nature of our male lead as well as the strong willed Gemma. I do wish things had gone a little differently in the end. I'm not sure that what Gemma did is fully representative of what a normal 16 year old would do, but I guess that what happened is what HAD to happen for the story. The romantic in me just wanted things to be different. I also think I'm suffering from Stockholm Syndrome even more so than Gemma was. I know that a lot of people won't sympathize with Ty at all. But I'm a sucker for a man with a hot bod and an Australian accent . Definitely, this is another of my favorite books I've read lately. And my favorite audiobook so far! ...more \"I made it,\" you said, gruffly, \"for you.\" You shoved it onto my finger. It was roughly carved, shaped from a lump of something colourful and cold...a ring made entirely from a gemstone. It was beautiful. It glinted emerald greens and blood reds over my skin, and had tiny flecks of gold catching the light. I couldn't stop staring at it. \"Why?\" I asked. You didn't answer that. Instead you touched the ring gently and looked piercingly at me, unsaid questions in your eyes. HOLY SHIT! I should not have \"I made it,\" you said, gruffly, \"for you.\" You shoved it onto my finger. It was roughly carved, shaped from a lump of something colourful and cold...a ring made entirely from a gemstone. It was beautiful.

Instead you touched the ring gently and looked piercingly at me, unsaid questions in your eyes. HOLY SHIT! I should not have read this book! (Even though it's definitely going to be on top of my 'favorites' list.) I don't think I've ever cried so much while reading a book! But I loved it! It was perfect. I wanted to read this book for so long, but couldn't get my hands on it. I was just very fascinated by the summary of the book, and who am I to deny that beautiful cover? Well, the story begins with \"You saw me before I saw you.\" Sounds intriguing, right? Well, it's like that from start to end of the book. So, Ty, kidnaps Gemma from an airport--putting drugs in her coffee so she wouldn't struggle--and takes her to a desert in Australia, where no one could find them. He has a whole life planned out for them both, thinking that Gemma would fall in love with him eventually. Throughout the book, Gemma tries (in vain) to escape, and the unusual thing is that Ty lets her. But soon, Gemma finds out she can't get out of there unless Ty will come with her, since he knows the desert better. As the story progresses, Gemma struggles with her feelings for Ty, especially when she found out that he was as desperate as she was, when she learns of his background. Ty was a very complex character. I never imagined to sympathize with a villain--if he could even be called a villain--much less one who kidnaps people, but Ty was such a sad, tragic character. There were times when I hated him for taking Gemma against her will, but when Gemma found out that she loved him, it was like I was falling for him right along with her. Seriously, it was like I was getting Stockholm Syndrome too! <---A>Lucy Christopher</---A> knows just how to mess with your mind. It was all like this to me: ...I love Ty, he's amazing...wait, no he's not, he's a stalker and a kidnapper...but he's so sweet!...let go of Gemma you controlling creep...Oh my gawd he's so effin' hot!... It's like having the devil and angel on your shoulder! So, yes, he kidnapped her. But he also loved her passionately. He knew he was going to go to prison, but he chose to stay by her side and save her. That's what I loved about him the most. The fact that he ran miles to save her life. Ugh, I'm getting conflicted again. Again, I can't really express my feelings about this book, but it was definitely the most intense book I've ever read. I couldn't put it down. I want Lucy Christopher to write a sequel. She can't leave it like this! But, at the same time I don't really want her to. It's actually the ending--that tear-jerking, heart-wrenching ending--that made the book so unique and unforgettable. I don't want that to be ruined. ...I'm doing it again, aren't I? Dammit, I have to stop contracting myself. Makes me sound like a weirdo who has no idea what she's talking about. ...more Spoilers \u2026 that\u2019s it? Well, that was a shit fucking letter, wasn\u2019t it? Can you even call that a letter? It\u2019s just a recollection of everything that happened between Gemma and Ty. As if someone would be able to remember every conversation that had happened on every day for a month. It\u2019s fine as a story, but I did not accept the letter concept. It reminds me of a certain Friends episode where Rachel and Ross are fighting and Rachel wrote him a letter. Ross: \u201cI fell asleep!\u201d Rachel: \u201cYou fell asleep ?! Spoilers \u2026 that\u2019s it? Well, that was a shit fucking letter, wasn\u2019t it? Can you even call that a letter? It\u2019s just a recollection of everything that happened between Gemma and Ty.

Ross: \u201cI fell asleep!\u201d Rachel: \u201cYou fell asleep ?!\u201d Ross: \u201cIt was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back !\u201d I think it\u2019s safe to say that my expectations were way up high, because of all the skyrocketing ratings, and it all came crashing down into a million pieces. I thought this book was going to be fucked up, all kinds of twisted, but luckily for Gemma she met the world\u2019s most docile kidnapper in the history of time. Sure, he followed her for a couple years, but he actually took good care of her and didn\u2019t force her into anything. He had expected her to love his little place in the middle of nowhere. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t love living in a fucking desert, away from every type of civilisation, hunting camels and kangaroos and possibly being bitten by poisonous snakes? But when Gemma keeps whining, he promises that he\u2019ll take her back to the real world if she still doesn\u2019t love it after four months. That sure is convenient. But hey, we are supposed to like Ty, right? He\u2019s given these bright blue eyes and a tight body so we\u2019ll swoon over him, and a dramatic back-story and a guilty conscience so we can feel sorry for him. He loves Gemma, in his own twisted way. He means well; all he wants is company, never mind the fact that his company is there against her will. But hey, he\u2019s actually a pretty nice guy, so he doesn\u2019t force his company on Gemma, which results in one of the most boring books I have ever read. Nothing happens. They just live alongside each other and have awkward conversations. Hell, if I want awkward conversations I\u2019ll talk to someone. While you guys are swooning over Ty, can you still remember that he actually kidnapped a girl and once fenced her in like cattle? Because he didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about Gemma when he took her away \u201cfor ever\u201d. I\u2019m just saying \u2018cause Gemma seemed to be forgetting all that as we got nearer to the ending, even falling asleep in his arms and wanting to kiss him. At the end, he\u2019s just another pretty boy. But a weird little fucker at that \u2013 he paints his penis . Do I need to say more? Then comes the ending and because of a snake bite Gemma ends up being rescued. Ty decides to take her back to the real world to save her life, knowing that he\u2019ll end up in prison. Once again, thank fuck for Gemma being abducted by such a gentleman . She even kisses him on the cheek in the end and thanks him for showing her some beautiful landscape. Are you fucking kidding me with this? \u201cYes, you may have kidnapped me and I hate you, but I love you too and it sure was beautiful over there.\u201d Girl, you need help. I understand Stockholm Syndrome and it really fascinates me, but this just wasn\u2019t done well. Gemma\u2019s writing was boring and detached and it left me feeling completely empty of any feelings other than anger. Because I am angry. I am sorely disappointed and, well, fuck this book. Snape is not amused. ...more Stolen is such a singular reading experience that its difficult to decide how I feel about it. Gemma is a sixteen year old English girl kidnapped by Ty and taken into the Western Australian outback where she is held prisoner. I had to give this book five stars for several reasons. One of the reasons is because it was so fantastically well written. Beautiful, touching, heart breaking and real. Christopher doesn't spare on the details both good and bad. Never before have I felt a book to be so real, Stolen is such a singular reading experience that its difficult to decide how I feel about it. Gemma is a sixteen year old English girl kidnapped by Ty and taken into the Western Australian outback where she is held prisoner. I had to give this book five stars for several reasons. One of the reasons is because it was so fantastically well written. Beautiful, touching, heart breaking and real. Christopher doesn't spare on the details both good and bad. Never before have I felt a book to be so real, so gritty and tangible. This book is a journey into the world of Stockholm Syndrome and the craft of Christopher's skill left even me, feeling the effects of this baffling psychological problem. The characters of Ty and Gemma are fantastic. At first I was frustrated with Gemma. I was so used to reading kick-ass female protagonists who could do anything that it was aggravating to be stuck with a sixteen year old who was incapable and terror stricken. Yet she gets to you. Her pain, her struggles. She's a real sixteen year old. This isn't some fantasy character that can do everything. Yet she has a sense of will and spirit. Perhaps her defining characteristic is the truth that she is willing to tell herself - completely and honestly. Ty is also amazing as a character. He is equal parts scary, confused, angry, hostile, delusional. He is also beautiful, gentle, capable, intense and loving. He is such a mixed bag of all these things. If you're looking for action and suspense in this book - you won't find it. Yet I personally found the strength of the characters and the outback itself was strong enough to carry this story without needing a great deal of edge-of-your-seat intensity. The mental intensity was enough for me. Others may find this story boring but I found it touching and amazing. I highly recommend it. ...more I just had a copy of STOLEN by Lucy Christopher put into my hands at ALA, and I am definitely, definitely sending a quote for them to use for the paperback edition.

It makes for a very complex read with no easy answers, just like I like \u2018em. I loved how all of the motivations were thoroughly grounded in past history; we get a profile of the kidnapper as a human, not just as a stick figure. As a teen, I would have adored this book even more. My only complaint? It reads a little long in places, but I think that may have been my deadlines speaking more than the book\u2019s shortfall. I know there will be many that say that this isn't how most kidnappings go down and tell you to go read LIVING DEAD GIRL instead, but I don't believe that books need to tell the most common story -- just the one most interesting to the author. Highly recommended! ...more So, the hype surrounding this book..... I've read a few books on the topic of kidnapping now, and I can safely say this one is my least favorite so far. Firstly, the actual kidnapping that takes place just seems SO UNREALISTIC to me that I can't even take it. I find it really hard to believe that a 25 year old man could so effortlessly get a 16 year old girl who is drugged out of her mind through airport security with a fake passport. Just no. That would not happen. The one thing I enjoyed about So, the hype surrounding this book.....

I liked that it was a bit different in that way. However, the entire story fell very flat for me, and I never cared about what was happening. I was interested at the beginning because the kidnapping scene was really thrilling (until it made no sense), but after that I was extremely bored. I didn't grow to care about Ty like so many people seem to, and I never really came to understand why he even took Gemma in the first place. At least not specifically. I need specifics in a book like this (read If You Find Me by Emily Murdoch for an example of a well fleshed out story). Not the worst book I've ever read, but definitely the worst kidnapping book I've read yet. ...more Five stars. I really don't know how to feel right now.

It's confusing how this book makes you feel so much compassion for something so terribly wrong. That's the entire point though. The problem is, by the time you've grasped it all, it's too late. The story ends, and like Gemma, you find your heart aching for everything you finally understand. Yes, this book is complicated. And confusing. And a storm of emotions. It's also beautiful. And captivating. And so, so breathtakingly real. This is the kind of story that will stick with you. ...more I'm still crying as I type this.

I would've done some of the things she did if I were in her position, and I would've thought of things the same way she did. She was always wary, always looking for chances of escape, even though it was pretty much hopeless. And then there's Ty. I wasn't expecting to be so in love with him. I wasn't expecting this at all. But even less than 100 pages in, I had already warmed up to him. He is not evil or cruel in any way. He is broken and lonely and fuck I have tears landing on the backs of my hands. The last parts were really the parts that hit me. Deep. I loved how this book ended. I loved everything about this book and oh my god forget about all those books that I've said are the best books I've ever read because this one tops every fucking list. I'm not kidding.

A heart only for Ty of course. What I loved about this book was Ty. Yes I know what he did was wrong, but the way the author wrote his character, makes your heart hurt for him. Our brains just don't point out the fact that he kidnapped a living, breathing human being, and kept her in a place against her will. Instead we feel for Ty, sympathize him for what he went through and find ourselves thinking how everything would be better if Gemma just gave him the love he wanted. Ty isn't like our typical kidnapper who kidnaps girls, threatens her parents, enjoys raping her and torturing her. He just thought that she would be much happier with him in that place. He thought that if they loved each other and if they stay together in the middle of nowhere they would be happy. He didn't want to hurt Gemma, he didn't want to touch her and torture her, but he kidnapped her and kept her in the middle of nowhere with him and that's definitely not okay. Still, as you read about him, he's nothing but a broken human being in need of love and care and god damn did he make my eyes sweat. No matter what he did, I felt pity and hurt for him. And how many times did I wish Gemma just loved him and made everything better. Sorry this wasn't much of a great review, but honestly I just don't know what to write for this book. Take all the stars Ty. All of 'em. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Reaction to finishing this: So like, I finished this.

It's a treasure for a reader like me, fascinated by crazy and sick. But somehow Stolen didn't move me in any significant way. While I found the premise to be extremely interesting and pretty much a genius idea on Lucy Christopher 's part, I thought the execution of this idea was lacking. A book which centers on intricacies of human psychology ought to have realistic characters. Neither Gemma nor Ty ever came alive for me and therefore the entire journey of Gemma's to form an attachment to her kidnapper never worked IMO. Neither did I have any feelings for Ty and his sad-sad life stories. I saw how the author tried to make him somewhat attractive and worthy of compassion, but for me Ty remained a creep from the beginning till the very end. I also found that the letter format (which I love) of the novel didn't quite work. Normally letters tend to give me an upclose understanding of the characters who write them, but in this case Gemma stayed anonymous and distant throughout the story. Endless \"I\"s and \"you\"s drove me nuts too. I still think Stolen is a great discussion book. Penny brought up a particularly interesting topic in her review about a disturbing trend in YA literature to portray unhealthy relationships as romantic. For me personally the book was spoiled by poor characterization, overwhelming telling instead of showing, and boring pacing. It will sound harsh, but I don't think Lucy Christopher is a good writer and I don't think she knows human nature enough to undertake such topic. My opinion is in a minority however, so maybe you should pick up the book and judge it for yourself. ...more Okay...

She has been drugged. She is being kidnapped. Now, meet Ty and Gemma: When Gemma comes to, she is surprised. She isn\u2019t tied up, the doors aren\u2019t locked. She is just in a bed in a house in the middle of nowhere. There is desert and sand everywhere, but nothing else. She tries to escape, but Ty explains to her that there is nothing close, they are hundreds of miles away from any kind of civilization. She has so many questions: Why her? What does Ty want from her, how long is he planning on keeping her here? Gemma soon realizes that Ty is not the guy she thought he was. Ty actually first met Gemma when she was 10. He loves Gemma, he wants her, and only her, forever. Gemma has a hard time dealing with this. It takes her a long time to understand and trust Ty. She wants her freedom, she wants to leave, and many times- she tries to escape. The desert is a beautiful but scary place, trying to escape this secluded place can be more dangerous than staying. Its very hot during the day, and very cold in the evening. But Gemma is strong. She is determined, and I loved her for that. But eventually, Ty started to wear her down. She saw that Ty wasn\u2019t a monster. He was just a lonely guy with some issues who truly did love her. He also does something not many kidnappers would ever do...

Deep down, I believe if they would have made it to the 4 month mark, and she still would have wanted to go- he would have let her. No matter how much he loved her and wanted her to stay. (hide spoiler) ] And she started to have feelings for him as well, towards the end. And you expected me to love you. And that's the hardest bit. Because I did, or at least, I loved something out there. But I hated you too. I can't forget that I\u2019m going to just put it out there that I LOVE TY! Yes, I know he is a kidnapper, but he is not a bad guy. Ty\u2019s history/background made him the person he is. I sympathized with him. He is sweet, kind, beautiful, and its really hard not to like him- in his head everything he did was for Gemma, because he loves her. You can\u2019t fault him for that. My favorite reason TY IS AMAZING (view spoiler) [At the end, he chose to SAVE GEMMA and stayed with her when he could have just left her at the clinic and got away. She wanted him to stay, so he did.

I wanted you in the apartment. I wanted your arms around me, your face close to mine. I wanted your smell. And I knew I couldn\u2019t - shouldn\u2019t - have it. That\u2019s what I hated most. The uncertainty of you. You\u2019d kidnapped me, put my life in danger . . . but I loved you, too. I don\u2019t even know how to conclude this review... Honestly, I probably should have waited a few days to write this one because my head is all over the place and I am so full of emotion, but I just wanted to put it out there. I loved this book, I loved Ty, and I want a sequel. If you haven\u2019t read this one, you should. It is unlike any other kidnapping/captured book I have ever read. It\u2019s one of those I know will stay with me. I also thought the way it was written was interesting, all from Gemma\u2019s pov as a letter to Ty. A 5 star book for me I would HIGHLY recommend!

Gemma who made a mistake... She is the type of the girl which is persistent, not a quitter and still hopeful...

She was scared, and i was scared with her. \u2666 Ty : \u201cPeople love what they're used to, I guess.\" \"No.\" You shook your head. \"People should love what needs loving.

And even when i learned of his past...his actions still weren't right...and i cannot forgive him for that. Which leads to simple fact that he never understood right from wrong... And it made it easier for him to plan all of this (and it took (view spoiler) [ 6 years...Were were talking about his sanity right? (hide spoiler) ] ). But, i have to say that in the end, i did like him, because of one thing: He never made her do something against her will, except to stay with him. ____________________________________________ OVERALL : ____________________________________________ I just loved it.

In the airport, that day in August, you had that look in your eyes, as though you wanted something from me, as though you'd wanted it for a long time. No one had ever looked at me like that before, with that kind of intensity. It unsettled me, surprised me, I guess. Those blue, blue eyes, icy blue, looking back at me as if I could warm them up. They're pretty powerful, you know, those eyes, pretty beautiful too. So as you can read from the blurb, this book is written You saw me before I saw you. In the airport, that day in August, you had that look in your eyes, as though you wanted something from me, as though you'd wanted it for a long time. No one had ever looked at me like that before, with that kind of intensity. It unsettled me, surprised me, I guess. Those blue, blue eyes, icy blue, looking back at me as if I could warm them up. They're pretty powerful, you know, those eyes, pretty beautiful too. So as you can read from the blurb, this book is written like a letter from Gemma to her captor. It mostly just tells the whole story. This book brought out quite a few feels from me. Here is this hot guy that steals Gemma away from the airport and her family. NOT GOOD! Here is a hot guy that takes her to Australia. Here is a hot guy that DOESN'T rape her. Here is a hot guy with a lot of issues from LIFE. Here is a hot guy that has been watching Gemma for many years. Here is the same hot guy that saved Gemma from being raped, but she didn't know it until he took her. \"How long have you been planning it?\" You shrugged. \"Awhile, two or three years. But I'd been watching you for longer than that.\" \"How long?\" \"About six years.\" \"Since I was ten? You've been watching me since then?\" You nodded. \"On and off.\" \"I don't believe you,\" I said. But something inside me was telling me to think about it. There was something there, at the back of my mind that, if I thought about it a little more, might make sense of all this. Over time, Ty tells Gemma about when they first met and how and it was really sad and sweet. I don't want to tell you about that. Ty also tells Gemma when he decided he wanted her in his life forever. Of course taking her against her will and making her live with him isn't the right way to go! Ty was crazy, so many of us are and he had some weird ways, but those ways were just who he was, how he expressed himself. Now I'm just talking about Ty the person, not the guy that stole a girl to live and love forever. He was expressive in beautiful ways, he could see the good in nature and little things, he was always kind to Gemma even when she was trying to run away or when she would attack him. He just wanted to live alone on his land with her and try to have a life together. He was making things up really well considering. I mean living off the grid and all. He just needed to get his head on right and maybe over the years tried to have talked to her and not steal her away. Oh well, then we would have a different book. Ty asked Gemma if she would just stay there for 6 months and see how she felt after that. Gemma said she would for four months. He would then let her go if she didn't love where they lived and didn't want to stay there. But then something stupid happens and he has to get her to a hospital. And that was it. That is the one thing that irritated me about the book. I wanted to see what all would happen in the four months. But Ty risked being taken to jail in order to save Gemma's life and at the end there, Gemma started to like Ty when she started to just listen to him and they talked. No matter what would have happened, there would always be that thought. . . well I have fallen in love with you now, but you stole me you arse! How would you even work with that? I guess the one good thing is that she got stolen by a nice guy and not someone who raped and tortured her to death! And in the end, it doesn't really matter what I think or what you think. We just love books and we don't all love or understand the same books! And I could care less as long as we are all happy with something!

Let me start off by saying that this was not an easy story to read. From the moment I started reading it, I felt like there were dark clouds looming over me and something bad was going to happen any minute. And I pretty much felt that way throughout the entire book, which explains exactly why I was so hesitant to start it at first. But in the end, I'm really glad I finally did give this fascinating story a try because I ended up loving it and I've definitely found myself a new author to put on my favorite authors list. Stolen is written as a letter from the kidnapped young girl, Gemma, to the man who took her from her family and the life she knew, Ty. The way the author has written it, the story seems much more realistic than many other captivity stories I've read so far. When sixteen year old is on vacation with her parents, she meets the charming and trustworthy looking twenty-five year old Ty in a coffee shop at Bangkok Airport. \"It's funny, but I always thought I could trust blue eyes. I thought they were safe somehow. All the good guys have baby blues. The dark eyes are for the villains...the Grim Reaper, the Joker, zombies. All dark.\" But not Ty...his eyes were the perfect blue, the kind of blue that sucks you in and pulls you under its spell before you realize it's too late. \u2662 He makes her trust him. \u2662 He deceives her. \u2662 He steals her. \u2662 And he takes her. \u2662 Far, far away. He takes her to the Sandy desert in Australia. A place so isolated, so devoid of any human existence that there's no way for Gemma to reach to anyone for help... Gemma is not an easy victime. She's a strong, admirable heroine and she tries to fight Ty every chance she's got. (view spoiler) [At times, I even thought she was a bit too harsh towards him, but then I of course remembered what he did in the first place... (hide spoiler) ] Although, Gemma hates her new living conditions at first, she does start to appreciate the wonders of nature a bit more every day. She even starts to get attached to tha camel Ty has caught and decided to keep around as a mode of transportation. And Gemma certainly hates her captor too. She makes it perfectly clear to him too. But along the way she also starts to understand where he's coming from more and more... \"You were stupid and evil and mentally ill. That was all. When you started talking, you started changing.\" When Ty begins to open up to Gemma about his past, she starts to see him in a different light. He becomes more than just her kidnapper. Becomes of everything they go through together, she starts to get attached to him in a way too, but I wouldn't call it Stockholm Syndrom exactly. I think it's normal for anyone to start to form a connection to the person you're in such close proximity with for such a long time and who essentially treats you with kindness and respect most of the time too. \"That's what I hated most. The uncertainty of you. You kidnapped me, put my life in danger...but I loved you too. Or thought I did. None of it made sense.\" This is not only a story about kidnapping or dispair or being forced to live in the harsh surroundings of the Australian desert. It is also a story about hope, love and forgiveness. It's a story about being forced to readapt, to start over a whole new life a,D being able to make it work out for the best. It's also a story about the power of nature and of finding beauty in living of the land that nature gave us, with not much luxury to accompany it. Although the story ends with sort of an open ending, it still made me really *really* sad in a way. (view spoiler) [I just couldn't help but feel sorry for Ty. What he did was terribly wrong and there's no excuse for the way he handled things. But I do think it's sad that someone like him, who wanted nothing more than to be one with nature, was reduced to spending his days in a small cell. The fact that he gave up on his dream to live out in the wild in order to accompany Gemma to the hospital show just how much he really did love her and was prepared to give up his freedom for her. That makes his actions a bit more redeemable, in my opinion. And I really hoped the judge would give him a punishment accordingly, instead of looking him up in a windowless room. (hide spoiler) ] I would have loved for there to be a sequel or maybe a short novella about (view spoiler) [how the process would have ended (hide spoiler) ] , but like I said, I'm more than okay with it being an open ending as well. All I have left to say is that this story will, with absolute certainty, stay with me for a very long time. Even now, days after finishing it, I still often think about it. Stolen is a unique novel with a very powerful message that I would highly recommend everyone to read and hopefully end up loving just as much as I did!

I was hooked to this story from the beginning and despite how I knew nothing good would come of it, I drove head on collision with the conclusion and was left with a wreckage of angst and sadness. But before I tell you how I really felt, excuse me a moment, while I self-reflect... Felt an emotional pull toward the captor? Check. Believed that he deserved some semblance of happiness because of his past? Check. Recognized moments where the captor showed love and deep emotion toward the victim? Check. Justified the captor\u2019s actions because he provided a safe haven for the victim and wanted him to have a HEA? Check. Well sweet painful HALE I think I\u2019m a prime candidate for Stockholm Syndrome. Gah! Stolen brought to the surface justifications I never thought I\u2019d consider and deep feelings for Ty despite his heinous act toward Gemma. What a crafty author to be able to tamper with my moral compass without my awareness and create a story and situation where I wanted the captor to get an ending he really didn\u2019t deserve. In Stolen Gemma is kidnapped from her family in Bangkok Airport and taken to the Australian Outback by Ty, an emotionally disturbed young man. She fights despite futile efforts to get away, but after a series of close calls, she finds herself in a situation where she starts to see Ty through a different lens, one that includes sympathy, resolve, hidden beauty and love. For me, I think my defenses toward Ty fell apart when he rescued Gemma from one of her escapes where she almost died in the desert. I started to wonder if there was some way these two could come to build a life together. Part of me carried some hope and the other part cringed. So much happened in this book and I think I internalized a ton of the emotion because I feel like I\u2019ve been walking around in a daze since I started this story. After all was said and done, I think the author ended the story appropriately (yes, there I go again with that word, but I think it fits here) because as much as I wanted Gemma to help free Ty and give him a second chance, I realized that sometimes you must pay the price for your crime before you get your reprieve. This was definitely an angsty book that created conflicting emotions for me. Intense!! Lastly\u2026 I hope someone went back to the shack and fed the chickens. I also worried about the camel. I hope she was able to find her herd. I know\u2026 I know.. I focus on the irrelevant details, but that\u2019s just me. ...more This book. I read it. And it gave me feels. Sometimes the narrative.

All you have to do is find a piece of paper and something to write with and start making strike marks for every scene in which Gemma should attempt to KILL Ty. I think I got up to 27 or so, with each murder becoming more devious and creative than the last. Concerning, I know. I\u2019m thinking about seeking professional help. Speaking of the man Gemma should have MURDERED, he remained a creepy, unstable bastard for me from the first page to the last. Every time I found myself starting to think that being trapped in the middle of nowhere with a rugged Aussie that, for the most part, fell somewhere in the tolerable side of the crazy/hot scale didn\u2019t sound so bad, he\u2019d do something truly disturbing like admit that the first time he felt attracted to her was when she had a near miss with sexual assault. Or admit that she looks like his mom. Christian? Is that you??? NOT AGAIN! I had a lot of issues with Gemma too but they really weren\u2019t her fault. She was your average city dwelling teenage girl with ZERO survival skills. She convinces herself that writing HELP in the desert sand won\u2019t do any good, doesn\u2019t think that the steel of the knife she hides is greater than the muscle of Ty and deludes herself when he starts telling her how long he\u2019s been watching her. Why? He\u2019s obviously batshit cray-cray, HE KIDNAPPED YOU! Let the man tell you about how fucked up he is so you won\u2019t feel so bad when you finally cave to my demands and MURDER HIM. Also, her attempted escapes were laughable. You have all this free time and you can\u2019t come up with anything better than running into an endless desert with no supplies or stealing a car? Here\u2019s a thought, your captor admitted to having enough food stockpiled to last YEARS. Choose one of the 27 ways I suggested for you to kill him, KILL HIM, find the keys to the car, the spare gas, food and water and drive your ass out of the desert. Or just KILL HIM and chillax for a bit. Either way\u2026 KILL HIM. Regardless of my personal level of crazy, I was captivated by this book. I found myself constantly wondering how it would all play out, how it would end. And as much as I wanted to see that ending I wish it hadn\u2019t come so soon. I wish the \u201cStockholm Syndrome\u201d went further than it did. I feel that it really could have been explored to a greater depth. So in the end\u2026meh. Not as good as I thought it would be but still an intriguing enough premise to warrant two stars. ...more I literally just put down Stolen and my brain...it can't think.

When I went into it, I was almost expecting an eventual romance, but there is none and I'm glad there isn't. Stolen is a novel of abduction, but it is also a novel of hope and faith and beauty. I only really fell in love with Stolen seven pages from the end; until then, I was on the fence. I think, more than anything, I was confused while reading this, which is what you're supposed to feel... You see, this book is such a mind-fuck (excuse my language, but there is really no other better way to put it) because on one hand, you despise Ty for stealing Gemma, for taking her away from her home, for stalking her for so many years, for making her life miserable; but, at the same time, I despised Gemma whenever she destroyed Ty's art, when she hurt him with her words, when she mocked him and his love for his desert, when she failed to even try to understand him the way he so obviously understood her... Stolen isn't a romance and for 90% of the novel, Gemma is constantly trying to run away from Ty, to escape her predicament. Yet, somewhere, she realizes that some of what Ty says is true; society is terrible and cruel and parents really don't understand their children and sometimes even friends don't and terrible things do happen. But, that gene that tells you in your brain that you have to accept the bad things and move on, that you can't save everyone, that maybe even you can't save yourself...it wasn't in Ty. Yes, Ty steals Gemma, but he steals her because he thinks he's doing the right thing. Unknowingly, Gemma saves him as a child and he wants to return the favor. It's so mind-boggling because Ty isn't a bad person; he's nice to Gemma, he never harms her or takes advantage of her in any way, he clothes her and feeds her and shows her the beauty of the desert; but he's wrong in his own right, too. \"I can't save you like that Ty. What you did to me wasn't this brilliant thing, like you think it was. You took me away from everything - my parents, my friends, my life. You took me to the sand and the heat, the dirt and isolation. And you expected me to love you. And that's the hardest bit. Because I did, or at least, I loved something out there. But I hated you too. I can't forget that.\" Stolen, I felt, was a social commentary of sorts. It's difficult to understand and comprehend properly and it's painful because of that, because of the confusion we feel and the sudden desperation as we want to escape to a desert, see the sunset, and live alone, but happy, without the burdens of society and expectations of our parents and disappointments of our friends. In life, however, there are always two paths: the right one and the wrong one. From my experience, the wrong one is always the easiest, but leads to eventual downfall, just as the right one is full of hurdles, but ultimately leads to happiness. In Stolen, however, all the lines are blurred; just the way I like it in a truly fantastic novel. I will warn you, reading this novel is a strange experience. I felt uncomfortable, not knowing where the plot was leading, not knowing what I wanted to happen, but I feel better now that it's over. In some ways, I feel like this novel is better for a re-read than anything else, an opportunity to understand what really happened and where Gemma started to feel something more than hatred for Ty. One of the things that did surprise me, however, was how un-original Ty's story wound up being. Now, I won't say that it isn't terrible and cruel and painful, but the path that Ty took seems so much more strange than most people in his situation. I think, however, that to become a stalker like Ty, to become obsessed with a person, to think that you're saving them...you don't need to go through a unique traumatic experience for that. Anything, even something as small as six-year-old Gemma talking to him, a stranger, can alter the mind in such a way; after all, who are we to know the depths and recesses of our brains and how events can affect you? \"It sounded weird to hear you talk so much; normally you only said a few words at a time. I'd never imagined that you'd have a story, too. Until that moment, you were just the kidnapper. You didn't have reasons for anything. You were stupid and evil and mentally ill. That was all. When you started talking, you started changing.\" As for me, I don't know what to think. Yes, I do think Gemma suffered from a form of Stockholm Syndrome, I do think she makes the right decision, I do think Ty is slightly insane, I do think he is a good person, I do think his axis in life is just a little off...but I don't see Ty as a monster and neither do I see Gemma as a tortured abduction victim. If anything, there is too much of a silver lining to this tale. It's sad and depressing and unhappy, but it's also right and true and beautiful. \"And, let's face it, you did steal me. But you saved my life, too. And somewhere in the middle, you showed me a place so different and beautiful, I can never get it out of my mind. And I can't get you out of there, either. You're stuck in my brain like my own blood vessels.\" Lucy Christopher, I will read anything you write. Anything. Especially if it's a sequel to Stolen that I hope you will eventually write onto paper instead of keeping locked up in your head. I do have to admit, however, that the ending to this is perfect and it doesn't need a sequel at all. I wouldn't mind if a sequel was written, but I don't need one either. Just this gem of a novel is enough... I realize this is long, but it's also not much of a review, for which I apologize. It doesn't even begin to touch upon the complexity of Ty's character; his passion for the stark Australian desert, his talent with animals, his love of art, his intelligence and resourcefulness... It barely even grazes the vastness of the backdrop this book is set against, a landscape so harsh, yet lovely, that it was a deeply enigmatic character in its own right. But, all this isn't something I can just write about or explain or even begin to understand; it's something you just have to experience on your own. Without a doubt, I am in love with this book. It is thoughtful, compelling, and mind-numbingly provocative. It is written in a beautiful and creeping manner, molding its way around your heart all while growing thorns. Best of all, however, it makes you think and question your own life and long for something inexplicable...and, really, isn't that the most we can ask of a book? For it to impart some of itself in us, for it to make us see an author's passion, and for it to make us attempt to define that which is undefinable?

Gemma never thought that a friendly stranger could harm her.The story begins when she is in a coffee shop at the airport.There she spots a familiar face but she cant remember whether she has seen him again or not.This beautiful blond guy with those mesmerizing eyes approaches her.He is gentle and he buys her a coffee.However things didnt turn in her favor.Obviously Ty had other plans , for both of them. The one moment she is speaking to him , the next she wakes up in a deserted place. She completely freaks out with what happened.She cant help but wondering if this guy will kill her,rape her or gods knows what.However,Ty is not that guy.He didnt bring her with him to torture her but because (view spoiler) [he loves her (hide spoiler) ] and he needs company.Living in the middle of nowhere can be a little lonely sometimes. \u201cHow long will you keep me?\" I asked. You shrugged. \"Forever, of course.\u201d No matter what Ty does for her , she only thinks of ways to escape but she always ends up hurting herself. \"Wherever I went, you'd only catch me. I couldnt get away.\" She is trapped and she feels dead.That place is not alive but Ty tries to make her see the beauty of his world and the beauty of nature. Their relationship is not easy as she cant stop thinking whether she should kill him or wait for him to kill her.It doesnt take her long though to understand that he has no intention to harm her and they start getting closer. Dont judge me but I think that he was sick.He didnt harm her or treated her bad but his perfectly organised capture didnt take him a few months. (view spoiler) [Hell, he was setting this up for 6 years!! (hide spoiler) ] This kind of behaviour is not sane . In this story Gemma after her pointless efforts of trying to escape she finally accepts what they both agreed to.She starts understanding him and enjoys,as much as she can, the life with him . They say that you shouldnt plan your life bacause you never know what will happen. Gemma's life changed a lot when Ty came.When I was reading this book I couldnt stop thinking that he would eventually (view spoiler) [hurt her (hide spoiler) ] but I started trusting him , like Gem did.Ty is crazy and most of the times he doesnt make sense.He is fucked up and he needs someone to comfort him and ease his pain.Imagine how beautiful it would have been if he hadnt kidnapped her and they had met like a couple?He was deprived many things from life but the most important was love and that was what he was seeking. The ending was (view spoiler) [so heart breaking (hide spoiler) ] .It was the right thing but still in this book it didnt feel right at all . \u201cAnd it's hard to hate someone once you understand them.\u201d Was she suffering from the stockholm syndrome?

You're stuck in my brain like my own blood vessels.\u201d \u201cIt happened like this. I was stolen from an airport. Taken from everything I knew, everything I was used to.

The main character, Gemma, is a strong and capable girl who actually makes smart decisions after being kidnapped by Ty.

I also loved how Stockholm syndrome came into play. Everyone, including the reader, believes that Gemma is suffering from this syndrome and that is what is causing her to sympathize and later fall in love with Ty. However, I still questioned whether there was a part of Gemma that actually had fallen for him. ...more What would you do if you're abducted to the middle of nowhere? I hate deserts. I winced when Christopher described about the heat and the rawness of the desert. Why are we even talking about deserts? Why? Because in reality it's actually beautiful.

I winced when Christopher described about the heat and the rawness of the desert. Why are we even talking about deserts? Why? Because in reality it's actually beautiful. It shows the vastness of the world, the rawness, the emptiness and the loneliness. I read this short story called the Tears of the Desert by Paulo Coelho. It's a story about this man who listens everyday to the sobbing of the desert and a missionary who confronts the man about its sobbing. The man said that the desert cries everyday because it dreams of being useful to people and the missionary replies: \"Well, tell the desert that even though we human beings have a much shorter lifespan, we also spend much of our time thinking we are useless. We rarely discover our true destiny, and feel that God has been unjust to us. When the moment finally comes, and something happens that reveals to us the reason we were born, we think it\u2019s too late to change our life and continue to suffer, and, like the desert, blame ourselves for the time we have wasted.\" And the next day, the place where the man used to sit and listen to the sobbing of the desert seemed wet because a small spring started bubbling there. Soon the inhabitants built a well there and called the place 'The tears of the Desert' I know this is completely irrelevant to the review but this story floated into my mind while I was reading Stolen. Christopher has beautifully described the desert. A very difficult topic to describe because many of us do not understand the beauty of the desert. You saw me before I saw you. Gemma is our lovely lead who writes a letter to Ty, her kidnapper. A moving letter about how she was kidnapped by him and her life in the desert with him. I would have honestly cried if I was in Ty's place if the letter was addressed to me. Ty, her kidnapper was lovely too. I cannot dislike him because he kidnapped her. Wait - I cannot say 'I cannot dislike him' because I don't know how I feel about him. I like him, I love him and yet I still dislike him. He is a baffling specimen who is truly lonely at heart and is in a desperate need of company. I believe he wanted to be accepted by Gemma, he had known her for a long time. And unfortunately he found that to be accepted by the girl he likes - the only way is, is to kidnap her. How sad. How I wish he didn't do that and went out with her instead; like a normal boy would. But then, if this had happened the desert wouldn't be a part of this story, would it? The beauty of it shall ever be baffling and confusing to everyone who haven't been in a desert before. Stolen moved me, it blew me and in the end it killed me. Whenever I think about this book there is this slight pull of my heartstrings. It is not heartbreaking, I honestly don't know. It's not tragic romance. I don't know what this book conveyed but it surely did change my perspectives of various things. A beautifully written novel. I still cannot imagine how Christopher managed to write so beautifully about deserts and abduction. ...more Favourite Quote: \"Lets face it, you did steal me. But you saved my life too.

Truly, a stunning and thought provoking read. Lucy Christopher is a brilliant writer. She really get you thinking about what is right and wrong and the place in between. The plot was intense and captivating just like the characters. Stolen is a story that you get emotionally invested in. And the way Christopher vividly describes how stunningly gorgeous the land really is and how deadly it can be, makes it feel like it is another important character in this tale. When I think of Gemma the first word that comes to mind is brave. To be put in that situation at 16 I don't know if I could have handled it with as much strength as she did. She never gave up hope for escape even when her feelings towards Ty began to change. Ty, wow, what a damaged yet frighteningly beautiful soul. Even though it is written from Gemma's POV, I felt we got Ty story as well. He is a character that haunts your thoughts. I was so confused about how I felt about him. I know what he did was wrong and I should be disgusted by him but I liked him. You could see why he thought what he did was right in his head. Just thinking about him breaks my heart. The ending it made me cry like a baby and it hurt. I know some people will disagree with me but I really wish it could have ended another way. Yet I see that it would have been impossible. Stolen, is an unforgettable and breathtaking story that I highly recommend. Just make sure you are ready for a few tears.

Sadly, it was pushed to the side so many times, but I\u2019m glad I finally picked it up because it was a powerful and gripping read. All my nerves and emotions felt stretched tight while reading this, the tension high. I felt the zing of excitement as I turned the pages, both hoping for things to turn out one way and dreading if they did, as well. Sixteen year old Gemma is drugged and kidnapped from an airport and taken to the endless desert in the Australian Outback. She\u2019s not familiar with the land and it is brutal and remote which leaves little chance for escape. Ty, her captor is feels he\u2019s taken her from her materialistic, self-centered parents, to rescue her from the inevitable life she\u2019ll be shoved into if she stays. He wants company in his remote desert \u201cparadise\u201d and somehow he thinks Gemma is perfect for that life,\u2026perfect for him. Unfortunately for Ty, Gemma is not at all happy to be taken forcibly from her parents, her life, and civilization, but Ty won\u2019t let her go. He thinks time will change her mind. \"How long will you keep me?\" I asked. You shrugged. \"Forever, of course.\" *shivers* There\u2019s something profoundly flattering about another person being obsessed with you. Well, in theory, anyways. In real life it is disturbing. I was surprised to find that Ty was not overly romanticized, and that I really didn\u2019t like him in the beginning. He actually creeped me the heck out! He was good looking, mesmerizing to Gemma when she first meets him, and that\u2019s why he was able to kidnap her. No one had ever looked at me like that before, with that kind of intensity. It unsettled me, surprised me, I guess. Those blue, blue eyes, icy blue, looking back at me as if I could warm them up. They\u2019re pretty powerful, you know, those eyes, pretty beautiful, too. But her initial feelings are wiped out when she comes to and discovers her situation. Ty was clearly unstable and socially stunted, but as I continued to read, my feelings softened toward him, much like Gemma\u2019s did, so that we were both confused: \u201cA part of me understood why you\u2019d done it, too. And it\u2019s hard to hate someone once you understand them.\u201d This story felt very intimate as it was told in the second person narrative; Gemma is speaking to Ty, but I felt like the story was being told directly to me. After finishing Stolen, I have feelings of melancholy and I\u2019m seriously conflicted. I know what\u2019s right and what should\u2019ve happened. Did I want it to end like that? Yes, no,\u2026maybe. *sigh* The story was jarring and left my emotions all over the place. Lucy Christopher\u2019s debut novel was captivating, heart wrenching, confusing, with an underlying sexual tension that is palpable. I read on Ms. Christopher\u2019s website that she may write a sequel to Stolen. I hope she does as I would love to catch up with Ty and Gemma and tie up loose ends. If someone has any news on that, I\u2019d love to know! I want to thank the readers who picked this out of the poll we put up for last month\u2019s recap! It probably would still be sitting on my shelf, unread, otherwise. You can find this review and more at The Readers Den. ...more Beautiful. Evil, but beautiful.

He was so kind, considerate and almost harmless really (Hello, Stockholm!). He'd saved Gemma's life so many times and eventually sacrificed his freedom for her. How can anyone not love him a little for that? I understood his motivations. He was lonely and had been badly treated all his life. At first I had all kinds of ideas of what he was: paedophile, rapist, killer etc. He was none of those things. He just wanted to escape civilisation and when he spotted Gemma, who he believed was being neglected by her parents just as he was, he wanted to rescue her. I can't understand why people compare this to Living Dead Girl . Ray, the kidnapper is all of the things I mentioned above. He was not kind, he raped, he's a paedophile and he murdered. I did not fall in love with him. It's not a fair comparison. They're completely different. Although at times Ty seemed scary, he was vulnerable and fragile too. He cried. He suffered from nightmares. In some ways he's like a child himself, with his love of the land, his painting and his folk stories. His sense of fun can be a little strange but there are some funny moments. It's not all fear and confusion. Catching the camel was hilarious. She (the camel) had my heart from then on. As you can tell I loved Ty but I also cared about Gemma. At first I just wanted her to accept her situation, to stop looking for trouble. The number of times she said \"You're lying!\" or \"I don't believe you!\" got on my nerves because she said it in relation to the simplest of plausible statements but when she calmed down she was so starkly honest with herself even when she wanted to go into denial. She was strong. Both characters were to have survived their traumas. You may think I'm as loopy as Ty but I wished for a happy ending. Gemma and Ty together. Maybe not out in the desert forever but living on the edge of a small town. Happily ever after. I can dream, right? Stolen. Everything in this book is stolen, including Ty. Nothing belongs to anyone. Not even themselves. There's only the land and the sky. And survival.

Need I say more? When the review arrives, please be prepared for a lot of cursing and swearing. I can't help myself, I am too angry to settle for using half-heartened curses such as \"freaking\" and the like this time. And you know what? I had dealt with YA creepers such as Edward Cullen and YA douchebags such as Jace Lightwood/Wayland/whatever before, but none of them had ever driven me so mad... the actual review: penned after I'd finished the book Rating: 2.5 stars for this book. Let me tell you once more that at the beginning, I had expected myself to like this book, the writing is quite good even though I have my doubt about the subject matter: \"What? That dude kidnaps this girl and he expects her to love him? And it's supposed to be a Young Adult book?!\" To be honest, the plot of Stolen sounds more like those online erotica which I can easily found on many different NC-17 websites. So, how does the story actually turn out? In fact this is a difficult book to rant,I like the opening of the story, and Gemma, the kidnapped victim's struggle to grip onto her sanity and how she made her final decision. I also like the author's description of wildness of the Australian Outback. These are the bright-spots of the book. Plus I appreciate the author for NOT sugarcoating Ty, the kidnapper into some dreamboat or attractive bad boy, in fact she had made it quite clear that what the kidnapper did was wrong. However, I'm pissed off that in the middle of the story, the author had made a handful of clumsy attempts to draw readers' sympathy to Ty by giving him one big fat sorry-ass backstory. I'M VERY SORRY, BUT YOU CAN'T JUSTIFY KIDNAPPING AND STALKING WITH A BAD, FUCKED UP CHILDHOOD,PERIOD. I REFUSE TO BUY THIS GUILT TRAP, MS. CHRISTOPHER! I'm equally pissed off by how unrealistic many of the details and setting are in the book. The author, Ms. Christopher had made Gemma's kidnapping in Bangkok airport and she being spirited away to the Australian Outback sound ways too easy. Plus I can't believe Ty, an orphan who had been fending for himself ever since he was 19 years old could somehow manage to buy a farmhouse and stored whatever food and supplies he needed in it. Not only buying the farm, Ty, a homeless teenager, somehow also managed to afford staying in British for years and stalking Gemma in his spare time, AND he also managed to afford buying plane tickets, fake ID, fake passport and a truck for his kidnapping plan. Wow, none of these seem to be realistic to me. Gemma and Ty's characters also do nothing to redeem this story for me. Although I appreciate Gemma for not giving up and actually fighting back, still from start to end I don't have a grip on her personality and for many times she comes off as a bit of a whinny. She seems to be unhappy with her life, her parents and friends but she never clearly explains what her problem with them is, SO WHAT IS SHE COMPLAINING ABOUT ANYWAY!? On the other hand, Ty makes me so mad that I want to knock his skull in while screaming \"DIE! FUCKER, DIE!\" for being such a totally selfish and creepy kidnapper. WHO ARE YOU? WHO GAVE YOU THE RIGHT TO KIDNAP A GIRL SO YOU CAN *SAVE* HER FROM HER FAKE, PATHETIC LIFE!!!???? I don't care if a kidnapper cried in his sleep, I don't care whether he is emotionally vulnerable or not, I only care about him lying to a girl and telling her that her parents are selfish and don't love her enough to come looking for her; I only care about him being arrogant enough to think he can steal a girl and CHANGE her for the better. And because he is such an irredeemable fucker, I find it unacceptable for Gemma to moon over Ty, his well built body and the supposed \"wonders\" he had showed her. She really disgusted me at this point. I also can't stand Ty's cornering Gemma by surrounding the farm with chicken's fences like he is trapping some animal. Goodness, this fucker makes me sick. Therefore you can imagine how much shock I was in when I saw on discussion board that some readers actually blame Gemma for being \"heartless\" toward Ty. OMG! WHAT ALTERNATIVE UNIVERSE ARE YOU FOLKS LIVING IN!? Aside from Ty's unacceptable behaviors, I also don't think Ty's character is well built, and as a kidnapper he isn't even realistic. It looks like the author couldn't decide what to do with him, therefore sometime he becomes this lonely lost boy who only wants Gemma's company, sometime the author seems to want us to feel bad for Ty even though his actions (lying to Gemma about her parents, stalking her, forcing her to do things she doesn't want to, etc) show that he clearly has the making of a cold blooded criminal. Damn, that's so messed up. Last but not least, Stolen is supposed to be a long letter written by Gemma to Ty, but this \"letter format\" writing doesn't work. Gemma's voice sounds too cool, level-headed and distant, which doesn't look convening given how much the girl had gone through. Once again, I suggest you to read The Collector instead. It's a much worthy read. PSS: A wonderful article by a fellow Goodreads friend: http://openmindedskeptic.blogspot.hk/... ...more Stolen was a powerful and fascinating read.

Ty had weaved his way into her make up by that point. Ty is where this story gets interesting and it where Lucy Christopher shines. I wanted to hate Ty. I DID hate Ty! This is a man in his twenties who drugged and kidnapped a sixteen year old girl and brought her to a remote place with the intention of never letting her see anyone else again. Not only that, but he pretty much stalked her in London from the time she turned ten years old. HOWEVER, by the end, I was as conflicted as Gemma about Ty. Christopher messes with the reader\u2019s head. It is a mind trip. She allows us to see Ty\u2019s sweetness, vulnerabilities, his love for Gemma and we, as the reader, start to like him, maybe even love him as well. I found myself wanting Ty to have a happy ending and I wanted to help him with his inner demons and hurt. WHAT??? REALLY??? Ok, Lucy Christopher, you are a master at writing. Even though I knew in my brain that what Ty had done was wrong I still could not help sympathizing. That was the point and it was astounding! The ending of the book was perfect although it did shatter my heart. Gemma has been changed and I truly believe that she is going to be a stronger person for what happened to her. Lucy Christopher has written a brilliant novel. Read it! I will end this with a quote that really resonated with me. I think it sums up Gemma's journey and what she experienced. And, let's face it, you did steal me. But you saved my life, too. And somewhere in the middle, you showed me a place so different and beautiful, I can never get it out of my mind. And I can't get you out of there, either. You're stuck in my brain like my own blood vessels. ...more Wow this was a different sort of book. Not really what I expected. I liked it. But it really left me feeling very conflicted, much like the main character Gemma. Gemma was kidnapped or \"stolen\" by her stalker of 6 years, which she never even knew she had.

The thing that left me so conflicted is even though Ty took her against her will, and at times he seemed crazy, I ended up feeling for him. Wow this was a different sort of book.

I love that he never tried to force her to do anything, well except that one part where he drugged her and stole her. See thats where the conflicting feelings get me every time. He was SO wrong, but there were so many things about him that made you forget what he did. (view spoiler) [I hated thinking of him in jail, all he wanted was his desert. It was really sad. (hide spoiler) ] I guess I was suffering from Stockholm Syndrome by the end of this book. Back to my original point though, he was very respectful of her once they were out in the desert. He showed genuine concern and just wanted her to be happy. One part that really made me feel bad for him was when they were having a picnic right before they caught the camel. I ate the roll, and forced down some more sparkling wine. When your eyes closed against the sun again, and I had nothing else to look at I glanced quickly at your chest, curious, really. I'd only seen chests like that in magazines. I wondered if that's how you'd got all your money . . . modeling. I looked down at my stomach. I grabbed at it, seeing how much fat I could lift up in a roll. \"Don't worry,\" you said, one eye open again like a crocodile, watching me. \"You're beautiful.\" You tipped your head back again \"Beautiful,\" you murmured. \"Perfect.\" \"You wouldn't know. You're built like some sort of supermodel.\" I bit my lip, wishing I hadn't complimented you like that. \"Or a stripper,\" I added. \"Prostitute.\" \"I wouldn't want you to think I'm repulsive,\" you said, half smiling. \"Too late.\" You opened your other eye to squint at me. \"Will you ever give me a break?\" That part really got to me for some reason. She was constantly saying stuff like that throughout the book, but that interaction particularly sparked my feelings for him. (view spoiler) [ In a way I hate how it ended. I hated Gemma's last page about her dream and about what she was planning to do in court. But in another sense, I can't really see it ending any other way. It would have been pretty crazy if she decided to lie on the stand and then run off with him back to the desert. I just couldn't really see that happening. I hate that I had so many feelings for Ty and Gemma knowing that it would never work. I wanted so badly for everything Ty said about her parents to be true. I wanted them both to have a happy ending, and even though they both did what was right in the end, neither of them seemed very happy. :( (hide spoiler) ] ...more This book really made me think, especially about all the dysfunctional relationships disguised as romance in YA novels and movies.
