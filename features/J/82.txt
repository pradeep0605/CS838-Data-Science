They were the violent ones, the dark angels. This is the third novel in the Charlie Parker thriller series. And it\u2019s a corker. John Connolly writes beautifully and the dark subject matter appeals to me, so I was always going to like this series, but goodness gracious it\u2019s splendid stuff. There are people whose eyes you must avoid, whose attention you must not draw to yourself. They are strange,<---M> parasitic creatures</---M>, lost souls seeking to stretch across the abyss and make fatal contact with the warm, constant flow of humanity. They live in pain and exist only to visit that pain on others. The books are pretty macabre and the villains are, to the extent that the story requires it, caricatures. Connolly, however, is very adept at dealing with larger-than-life characters. Case in point: Mr Pudd. These are mystery novels, but with a breath of that something extra that differentiates them from the pack. The \u201csupernatural\u201d angle that Connolly introduces is purposefully vague and subtle, so readers who normally don\u2019t enjoy this kind of thing should have no problem here. Also, the novels absolutely have to be read in sequence to experience the character development of \u201cBird\u201d Parker as the author intended. Start with Every Dead Thing . There isn\u2019t much more to say. Much like Charlie Parker himself, these novels should not be underestimated. They\u2019re deceptively good. \u2026each night, when they returned home and tried to sleep, they would wake to imagined howls and think that they were once again standing by the shores of the lake, their hands cold and their boots thick with mud, surrounded by the bones of the dead. ...more How does one describe John Connolly's Writing AMAZING OUTSTANDING PHENOMENAL The Way he writes the Charlie Parker series is fabulous he gets the characters exact where you know where they stand in the story His faithful friends Louis & Angel are not to over the top but know how to take down the bad guys as well as Rachel.

I am no expert, having been raised during the purification era of the 1950\u2019s, when American politicians and the religious right were determined to cleanse America of everything involving sex or communism/socialism or free speech or books for adults or anyone non-white or anything unwashed, but I remember angels at that same time as being either naked desexed babies with wings or heavily draped white blondes looking a lot like the Statue of Liberty or they were flying about mature-looking white women with babies in their laps, everybody wearing nightgowns except the babies. Angels generally were helpless nice white people who encouraged folks to pray for assistance. Lately though, angels are showing up in literature and movies as psychopathic assassins and tough brutal soldiers either killing off or saving humanity, depending on which side they\u2019ve decided to act for. John Connolly, who lives in Ireland, the author of the Parker series, has made his murderous private detective hero a kind of a human soldier-angel, as well as a Maine native and a ghost medium with a liking for killing. He is a good person, if goodness is loosely defined as someone who loves to kill but has developed some thoughtful rules about the choice of victim. Parker\u2019s rules about when murder is OK appear to be: 1. if they want to kill me; 2. if they want to kill my woman; 3. if they want to kill my wingmen. Luckily for the citizens of America, Parker wants to be a good soldier angel. Children are off the table for Parker. Ok. Ahem. \u2018The Killing Kind\u2019, book 3 in the Parker mystery series, opens with a horrific murder. It involves one of the good people in MY book, an abortion provider. The murder involves spiders, lots and lots and lots of spiders. It is almost as horrific a scene as what is actually happening to birth-control doctors in real life! (view spoiler) [(Recently in the United States, birth-control providers are undergoing a genocide. Religious folks of all faiths have decided that doctors, nurses, secretaries, their families, and patients with their families who visit or work in birth-control clinics must be killed by any means possible. Religious people have been mostly shooting, stabbing and burning people who want to control the size of their families, along with bystanders - google this if you think I\u2019m kidding. These assassins typically are ordinary folk of faith who think if they accidentally, and not accidentally, kill the breathing children of patients in the clinics, as well as adult patients, with the doctors, they, in the eyes of their primarily Christian and Islamic God, are being good followers of Christ and Mohammad. Clearly, if you follow and believe the Bible or Quran literally, this IS truth for a Muslim or Christian - pick up the sharpest stones and start breaking transgressors\u2019 skulls until they die, although American believers seem to feel the modern gun or gasoline is better. Thankfully, most believers appear to be less dogmatic, which might be a problem, I guess, for the religious cherrypickers if the Bible or Quran REALLY is the word of a god. As an American half-breed who is an atheist, I am grateful that I don\u2019t have to worry about whether any god wants me, as a female, to be ignorant, impoverished and a slave to any man who wants sex with me anywhere anytime with anyone he designates, as required in the Bible and Quran! I like being able to read, write and have a working, social and athletic life outside of the bedroom, kitchen and house!) (hide spoiler) ] Later, a man in an actual cherry picker (religion unknown), with other workers, is clearing vegetation from the banks of an upper Maine lake in preparation for the building of a house. Shockingly, when dirt and roots have been dug out, human bones appear. Did the workers accidentally dig up a cemetery? Unfortunately, no. Records show the land is near a Baptist cult community which mysteriously disappeared without a trace in the 1960\u2019s. Charlie Parker has become a white-collar detective, working for corporations and married clients looking for employee and/or spouse cheating (which apparently is ok with anti-abortionists, BTW, despite religious prohibitions against divorce and theft - at least the religious right doesn\u2019t kill thieves and adulterers as much as they do people who don\u2019t want unwanted pregnancies in America). He is feeling a little disrespected by his clients, but it is paying his bills. He has Rachel Wolfe, academic psychologist, back in his life, and he is living in his comforting grandfather\u2019s house which he inherited in Scarborough, Maine. Except for the disrespect, he is happy with being a normal middle-class individual. Sort of. When a rich blue-blood ex-senator, Jack Mercier, contacts him to track down the killer of a business partner\u2019s daughter, Parker actually thinks about turning down the job, at first. It is not only that he dislikes Mercier, or that Rachel would not like him to take on dangerous jobs again, but Parker is afraid of tapping a dark place inside of himself, a reservoir of hurt and hate created by the murders of his wife and child three years ago. The ghosts whom he can\u2019t help seeing while he is on a case involving evil psychopaths have not been around lately, either. But when Mercier tells him that the daughter who was killed was Grace Peltier, an ex-girlfriend of Parker\u2019s many years ago, it changes his mind. Parker had discovered he was the kind of young guy who runs out on a girl if she thinks she might be pregnant, to his everlasting regret and guilt. The fact that it turned out she was not pregnant after all did little to mitigate Parker\u2019s guilt at his original feeling of RUN when Grace had told him she might be \u2018with child\u2019. So he takes the case. Parker learns Grace was investigating a religious cult, called the Aroostook Baptists, which had been created by a charismatic minister, Reverend Faulkner, his wife, Louise and their two children. That investigation somehow led Grace to where her body was found - the street in front of another religious organization, The Fellowship, headed by a man called Carter Paragon. While the Aroostook Baptists had mysteriously disappeared in 1963, The Fellowship are an active concern, advertising for dollars and support. But when Parker wants to make an appointment with Paragon to find out if Grace had spoken to him, all kinds of hell open up. A very terrible man, Mr. Pudd, begins to threaten Parker. Pudd seems to be a protector of The Fellowship, and Parker wants to know why Paragon needs such a horrible person as Pudd for a bodyguard, especially since Pudd\u2019s favorite pet is a spider, which is truly quite unorthodox. Then, a mafioso, Al Z, contacts Parker with a different case he wants Parker to take. Parker owes Al Z a favor from a previous case, so he meets with Harvey Ragle, porn producer. Ragle is in trouble with the law because in his movies he has been killing spiders and rats by women squashing them with high heels. Ragle has been receiving death threats from a certain odd gentleman - Mr. Pudd. Worse, the ghosts are back. Oh my. It looks like life is once again raining down monsters for Parker! ...more The disappearance of a religious community in Maine had long since been the subject of controversy. It wasn\u2019t until recently that the discovery of a mass grave containing those that had vanished all those years ago that the state began to get some answers.

It wasn\u2019t until recently that the discovery of a mass grave containing those that had vanished all those years ago that the state began to get some answers. Shortly after it\u2019s discovery, Detective Charlie Parker reluctantly becomes involved in the search for those responsible for the slaughter. Can Charlie uncover the truth behind the murders or will his connection with the afterlife ultimately lead to his downfall? With Every Dead Thing and Dark Hollow, Connolly spends a great deal of time getting to know Parker while also establishing a world in which his characters can live and breathe. However, with Killing Kind, Connolly takes the characters into as dark a direction as he can. Playing up the supernatural aspects that lingered in the first two books, Connolly puts it on front street for the reader to experience. Basically, what Connolly does is infuses those supernatural elements from the first two novels and turns the volume up to eleven. In saying that, I\u2019m not trying to convey that the story takes a turn in a direction that requires a certain level of disbelief. Connolly very much keeps the core story in the \"real world\". The characters develop in a natural way and you\u2019re not left wondering what kind of world he\u2019s trying to craft. It\u2019s a certain uniqueness that sets it apart from your standard procedural detective novel. Parkers main adversary this time around, Mr. Pudd is excellently well developed. He\u2019s truly a terrifying enemy and has some excellent scenes. Using recluse spiders as a means to kill his victims, I can confidently tell you that my skin was crawling on more than a few occasions. His relationship with his girlfriend, Rachel, begins to feel the strain of his job as well as his growing connection with the spirit of his first wife and daughter. Connolly begins establishing that Parker\u2019s life will never really be what he wants it to be. It\u2019s essential that you read this book before picking up the follow up, The White Road. Aside from The Reapers (the seventh book in the Parker saga), The Killing Kind and The White Road are his best work. Outside of where we find Parker in the outset of Every Dead Thing, Killing Kind and The White Road take Parker to his absolute limit so we truly get to understand what a gripping character he is. ...more How do you review a book this astoundingly good? There wasn't anything here that I could say I didn't honestly love about this book. John Connolly has it all from characterization, emotional turmoil, physical trauma, and electrifying atmosphere. I've already purchased the next book in this series, and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. A MUST-READ--HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION! The one book in the series I had up till now only owned in paperback, and now upgraded to a Hardcover version that fitted well with the whole series in hardcover. Some books will be kept and reread and I prefer them in the best way possible, this is one of those series.

An early Charlie Parker novel that sets him on the road for future installments, religion, faith are the strong undertones in this novel. And yet they are not about the faith but the people living their faith and obsessions. The story really starts with Charlie being hired to look into a suicide of which the employer is really not sure that is the cause of death. The lady in question was examining a certain Christian cult in the sixties that happened to vanish of the earth. Well as the story shows into the earth as the story goes their final resting place has been found and the evidence shows murder. While Parker continues his investigation he meets some people he would rather not have met and these characters prove to be lethal to even the most hardened of criminals. As Parker and his friends discover more and more they find that it is all more than they had wished for. Even the late Travelling Man does make an unwanted appearance in this story which gives a clue how awefull all will be for Charlie and his friends. His friends being Angel a master burglar and Louis a assassin, both retired! And of course his girlfriend Rachel who once again gets dragged into the affairs of her boyfriend. This time with her eyes open. This book offers an insight in the new motivations of Charlie Parker when confronted with evil, it will scare you if you have a problem with spiders. While this story does touch the religious movement of an early 20th century in Maine it is not so much about religion but about good vs bad. And the story begins with the finding of a mass grave... It is no longer Stephen King that shows us the evil parts from Maine, John Connolly does a brilliant job too. I guess it says something if my current three favorite writers have a lot of Maine in their books (John Irving, John Connolly & Stephen King). Perhaps It is sign that I have to visit that state one day only to assure me of the other face of Maine, namely the good one. ...more I believe that the true definition of courage is being afraid of something and doing it anyway. Charlie Parker feels fear and compassion and anger and remorse and goes forward anyway and it sets him apart and above any other private investigator/detective/etc. I've ever read about.

You will not find it an appealing place to visit. He must really hate the place. 3 Stars ...more My Favourite in this series so far :) Original Review : Well, John Connolly managed to more than reclaim the magic.

I wonder if I have anything unread that is easily accessible in the maze of books in my library... Second Time Around: This third book in the Charlie Parker series is one that I recall enjoying quite a bit. And re-reading it for the first time has also been a pleasure! This marks the first introduction of Connolly\u2019s honeycomb world - a recurrent theme throughout the series. Its imagery especially strikes a terrified chord in me with all of the horrifying spiders. I think this is one of the most frightening entrants to the series (at least to me!). And it\u2019s certainly one of the most exciting, too - incredibly fast-paced and completely enjoyable. I think it is one of the strongest books in the series - mostly because of how Charlie\u2019s purpose and character grows. He becomes so affirmed to his purpose/calling that I think it really sets the tone for the remainder of the series. It also starts to bring in a more heavily supernatural element - or at least hints at it, foreshadowing more of what is to come in later books. The supporting characters - Louis, Angel, Rachel and the others are also so wonderfully written and the epilogue reminds me of how thankful I am that I don\u2019t have to wait to continue reading on in the series (though I know that I will run out of books soon enough in this re-reading endeavor!)... But, for the moment, I am thankful that I have nine more books to go! ...more John Connolly should be congratulated. He managed to create a phobia where previously there was none.

The relationship between Rachel and Parker have developed somewhat (although not as far as Rachel would like). In the last book she was the one avoiding him and now he isn't moving fast enough for her. Still it's taking an interesting turn at the end. Also yeah to more Louis and Angel. I love those characters and although Parker is funny it's the humour of Louis I like best. The only downside to the book at all is that I was a little confused about the age of the victim Gracie. I had her down as roughly the age as Parker since they had a relationship in the past but by the end she and her friends came across as not much older than college students. Might just have been me though. Everyone should read these books. ...more Another good thriller featuring Charlie \"Bird\" Parker, Connolly's former NYPD officer turned private detective.

I had a hard time believing that Parker and his criminal sidekicks Angel and Louis could find them such challenging adversaries. With each book Connolly has increased the paranormal touches that make this series unique. While they do not help Parker in the resolution of his cases, they do seem to provide him with motivation to keep pursuing the cases. I get the sense that the deaths of his wife and daughter in the first book have created in Parker a psychic link with the dead. I like it. ...more Another good entry into the \"Bird\" Parker series.

Excellent! This book deserves all the stars. ALL OF THEM!! Once upon a time....in the Northern woods of Maine USA... \"In April, 1963, a group of four families left their homes on the eastern seaboard and journeyed north...for two hundred miles... to an area of land close by the town of Eagle Lake, twenty miles south of the border between New Brunswick and Maine. ...The Aroostock Baptists arrived in Eagle Lake on April 15, 1963. By January 1964, the settlement had been abandoned. No trace of the founding families...was ever found again.\" So writes Grace Pe Once upon a time....in the Northern woods of Maine USA... \"In April, 1963, a group of four families left their homes on the eastern seaboard and journeyed north...for two hundred miles... to an area of land close by the town of Eagle Lake, twenty miles south of the border between New Brunswick and Maine. ...The Aroostock Baptists arrived in Eagle Lake on April 15, 1963. By January 1964, the settlement had been abandoned. No trace of the founding families...was ever found again.\" So writes Grace Peltier in her postgraduate thesis some 37 years later. The thesis is never published: Grace Peltier is found dead in her car. Her father's ex-business partner, a former U. S. Senator (\"who came from money so old that some of it jangled on the Mayflower\"}, hires local private investigator Charlie \"Bird\" Parker to investigate the death. A few days later Charlie Parker watches on television a crime scene developing at St Froid Lake, a cold body of water in Northern Maine. A river bank has collapsed uncovering multiple human remains. A wooden identifying board is found around the neck of each victim. Charlie Parker is the creation of one John Connolly, Irish storyteller who lives in Dublin most of the year. At the time of this tale, the third of the series, Parker resides in his late grandfather's house south of Portland in Scarborough, Maine, where he grew up as a boy. He's an ex-NYPD detective turned disgraced P. I. haunted by the death of his wife and daughter by a serial killer. He drives a 1969 Boss 302 Mustang with spoilers and wings. You are going to love the world of Charlie Parker. His friends will become your friends. Angel and Louis, a duo of gay semi-retired criminals who share a delight in mayhem and occasional violence. Rachel Wolfe, criminal psychologist and profiler, who lives in Boston doing research and tutorial work at Harvard. Parker, in this novel, has a few shady friends, too. A New York mobster who is slain while attending the opening night of the Boston Ballet's \"Cleopatra.\" An illegal gun dealer found impaled on the main branch of an espaliered pear tree at the Cloisters. And a slim red-haired arachnidologist dressed in brown called Mr. Pudd who is no friend. You'll visit with Parker his favorite haunts in the northeastern part of America. The Orensanz Center in the Lower East Side of New York City. The Wang Center in Boston. The Strand Book Store on Broadway. The Portland Public Market. Chumley's Bar in the Village.

John Connolly's third novel to feature his private eye, Charlie Parker, also introduces us to one of the most loathsome and creepy serial killers I have ever encountered, Mr. Pudd.

Mr. Pudd loves spiders, especially black widows and brown recluses, both of which happen to be highly poisonous. He likes to put them in places that they shouldn't go, such as mailboxes, car glove compartments, or people's mouths... 'Nuff said. Parker is hired by a wealthy businessman to investigate the murder of a young girl named Grace, a college student who was investigating the disappearance of the Aroostock Baptists. The Aroostock Baptists were a group of families that followed the religious teachings of a man named Faulkner. In the 1970s, the entire group disappeared somewhere in the forests of Maine. Most believed that the group simply disbanded and went their separate ways, but when a highway construction team accidentally digs up a mass grave in northern Maine, thoughts of what happened to the Aroostock Baptists suddenly turn grim. Forensic evidence discovers that the victims had been tortured and killed. All of the bodies are accounted for, except for one: Faulkner's. As always, Connolly concocts a suspenseful murder mystery that twists and turns in unexpected directions. As stated before, the creepiness factor is amped up, as well. I have officially become a voracious Connolly fan, eager to read the next one in the series. ...more I am \"in love\" with Mr Connelly's writing. \"This is a Honeycomb World.

In this story, Mr Parker goes up against a religious cult and the leaders of the cult are enough to make one rethink their concept of evil. Charlie is aided by his friends, the most engaging and interesting Louis and Angel who successfully bring this book to its inevitable conclusion. Rachel, Charlie's love interest, becomes more of a fixture in Charlie's life and I find with the conclusion of this book, I am ever so anxious to begin the next in the series. I have never been much of a mystery reader, but I feel that before I had never read an author so very talented in bring ing out the macabre, the sinister, and the evil that can exist in the world. \"For in total blackness, time has no meaning.\" ...more Thrilling, engrossing, and sometimes creepy the third Charlie Parker novel from John Connolly pulls together everything he has learned in writing the first two and hits his stride perfectly.

Charlie seems to finally be coming to grips with the murders of his wife and daughter, and seems more in tune, if not accepting, with his ability to see the \"ghosts\" of the departed. Instead of mere revenge for those who have violently been taken from life, he's trying to steer a course of justice and redemption instead. It's a hard dark journey and that's part of the appeal. It's almost lifelike even in it's most surreal. I should mention that this one contains creepy serial killers, a creepy Doomsday cult, and creepy crawlies of all kinds! While the earlier books gave me a liking for the character(s) and for Connolly's style, this third one helps puts him on my list of favorites. ...more THE KILLING KIND - THE FELLOWSHIP-Ex Connolly, John- 3rd in series Spider-bites are a nasty way to die, and there is a man out there with an unusual taste for insect venom of all kinds and for the deaths of those who disagree with or affront him.
