Esta \u00e9 uma hist\u00f3ria sobre um inspector chamado John Rebus. Este elemento das for\u00e7as policiais, ao lado da sua colega e, acima de tudo, amiga, Siobhan Clarke, esfor\u00e7a-se para aplacar o medo real e asfixiante da sociedade pelos actos criminosos. Portanto, como devem imaginar, ambos contribuem para o bem-estar dos cidad\u00e3os da Esc\u00f3cia, ao contr\u00e1rio dos jornalistas. E n\u00e3o me julguem! As minhas conclus\u00f5es baseiam-se no relato das personagens deste enredo fascinante, ao qual imediatamente me afei\u00e7oei. O sentimento pela nobre - ser\u00e1? - profiss\u00e3o de jornalista \u00e9 comum nesta obra. Mas dizem eles, um da esp\u00e9cie pelo menos, que s\u00e3o o quarto poder. Mas quem lhes d\u00e1 credibilidade? Bobby Hogan, o respons\u00e1vel por esta investiga\u00e7\u00e3o, pede ajuda ao nosso her\u00f3i para encontrar respostas para o tr\u00e1gico acontecimento. Rebus, incapacitado fisicamente, arrasta consigo Siobhan para desempenhar as tarefas mais redundantes como conduzir, abrir uma porta ou acender um cigarro. Afinal de contas, o homem n\u00e3o pode usar as suas m\u00e3os. Pelo menos \u00e9 esta a explica\u00e7\u00e3o que d\u00e1 \u00e0 sua chefe, Gill Templer, que o mant\u00e9m constantemente debaixo de olho e n\u00e3o o deixa escapar \u00e0s t\u00e3o necess\u00e1rias, segundo ela pensa, repreens\u00f5es. A determinada altura \"Rebus teve um pensamento terr\u00edvel: os loucos tinham-se apoderado do asilo, os verdadeiros funcion\u00e1rios eram agora seus prisioneiros, da\u00ed o semblante vivo e corado de Billy. Ou isso, ou ent\u00e3o andou a mexer no arm\u00e1rio dos medicamentos.\" Bem, a mim a segunda hip\u00f3tese pareceu-me a mais plaus\u00edvel e julgo que ir\u00e3o concordar comigo durante a vossa experi\u00eancia de leitura. E n\u00e3o \u00e9 s\u00f3 o Billy que aparenta estar sob o efeito de estupefacientes. O humor deliciosamente contagiante das v\u00e1rias personagens torna-as igualmente suspeitas! Divertidas, sim, mas suspeitas de qualquer forma! Os dois investigadores v\u00eaem o seu trabalho dificultado pelos repetitivos confrontos com um membro do parlamento escoc\u00eas que foi detido numa rusga habitual a um antro de prostitui\u00e7\u00e3o, com um duo infernal que trabalha para o ex\u00e9rcito e com um parasita que trabalha como jornalista e insiste obter informa\u00e7\u00f5es em primeira m\u00e3o. \"Ele n\u00e3o achava que fosse um vil\u00e3o, mas tamb\u00e9m sabia que provavelmente n\u00e3o era um dos bonzinhos.\" Para mim, esta \u00e9 a frase que melhor descreve John Rebus, ao mesmo tempo que nos oferece uma ante-vis\u00e3o da qualidade de todo o enredo. <---A>Ian Rankin</---A> criou um her\u00f3i de carne e osso, um inspector com uma personalidade real e comportamento e atitudes verdadeiros. Com todos os seus defeitos e virtudes Rebus \u00e9 um ser humano como todos n\u00f3s. Longe de ser perfeito, o inspector esconde os seus segredos mais obscuros. N\u00e3o o fazemos todos? A normalidade desta narrativa, uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o aparentemente simples de conferir ao enredo, proporciona-nos uma linha de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e mist\u00e9rio que poderiam, sem d\u00favida alguma, desenrolar-se no mundo real. Se ficarem com vontade de ler este thriller impressionantemente bem escrito pelo escritor escoc\u00eas Ian Rankin, n\u00e3o me culpem.

Funny then that the one I picked to start with didn't actually take place in Edinburgh at all. No matter, though: <+++>A Question of Blood</+++> was a nice introduction to the character and his backstory, I think, even though it is a rather late entry as far as I can tell. I finished the novel pretty snappily, without finding myself bored or distracted and wanting to jump over to other plots and books (a common problem for me). The interwoven plotting and snappy pacing are both work well, the characters and relationships clearly drawn, and the various intrigues all reasonably twisty. Good news all around. Personally, I thought the main subplot related to Rebus' suspicious injury (suspicious because his hands have been severely burned and a man he'd had altercations with died in an arson fire) was resolved a bit too easily, as was the internal inquiry into his possible role in a murder. Additionally, while it does draw out the suspense and the reader's uncertainty, the fact that he knows whether or not he's telling the truth about his involvement in the event but *we* don't know is kind of a cheat. It feels artificial, given that we are inside his thoughts for much of the rest of the book, but it's not written first person so I suppose Rankin can get away with it. There were also times throughout the novel that I found Rebus' outsider status as your prototypical \"loose canon\" cop\u2014complete with the wise-cracking, the disregarding authority, the inadvisable outbursts, etc.\u2014a little forced. We get it already\u2014he's a lone wolf (except he's not). No need to overdo it. As a last side note, I loved the author intro on the book\u2014the stories about the characters that Rankin wrote in after auctioning character rights and the anecdote about being pranked by a member of Belle and Sebastian. Good way to get a feel for Rankin's sense of humor and also nice to see how he incorporated a character that he didn't himself dream up from scratch, but rather had to work in as a sort of exercise. ...more From BBC radio 4 - Drama: Thriller by Ian Rankin.

James wrote BAD JANE AUSTEN FANFIC. Not getting over that, never ever) or at least serve as methadone til the next French/Cain books. I'll have to read more books in this series to be sure, but sadly, am not too impressed so far. Rebus, with his drinking problem, disrespect for authority, and wisecracking, is clearly Marlowe in Black Watch, although he's modernized to the extent of having a female boss and partner, a cell phone, and an odd love for terrible modern pop. But he's still cut on the Marlovingian pattern, which is both a strength and weakness -- Marlowe is a pretty great character, after all, a kind of archetype at this point, but he's also a rather annoying asshole, who tends to know too much and withhold it from everyone else, including the reader. The other notable feature of this series is Rankin's determination to dynamite the Ye Bonnie Banks and Braes cliches by showing modern Scots in modern Edinburgh, which provides most of the colour detail in the book -- such as Rebus' washing out of SAS, the powerful petty criminals Peacock Johnson and Martin Fairstone, and an odd touching moment keyed to The Wind in the Willows (I for one didn't realize Kenneth Grahame was scottish). The opening shooting at a Scottish school seems based on the horrific Dunblane massacre, and other real crimes such as the Lockerbie bombing and the Chinook disaster which killed 29 RAF on the Mull of Kintyre are woven into the plot. Thankfully, this isn't done in the infamous \"ripped from the headlines\" manner of US crime dramas, but is a lot more subtle (well, that's hardly a compliment). I'm a little puzzled at all the praise these books for being literary and well-written because to me they seem like novelized film scripts. There's no description of the scenery or what people look like, characterization is shown almost completely through dialogue, and the characters themselves almost never think about what's happening to them -- which is all more like Hammett than Chandler. But even Hammett had moments like the dream of poisonous snakes and the famous anecdote about falling beams, moments which weren't just brutally in service of ruthless pacing driving on the unstoppable plot. I'm intrigued enough to read at least another two or three books in the series, but not sure if Rebus is worth the effort. Perhaps I just picked the wrong book (entirely at random) to start off with (yes yes I know, but the very early books apparently aren't that great, and I just went with an entry that had good reviews and sounded interesting). ETA: Hah! http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/artic... Occasionally, Rankin's famous friends and his imaginary ones converge. Such as the time when he agreed to write into his novel a real person who had donated a large sum at a charity auction for the privilege. The man, whose name was Peacock Johnson, duly turned up in A Question of Blood \u2013 but when Rankin tried to make contact again he had disappeared. A bit of Rebus-style investigation revealed that Peacock Johnson is the alter ego of the bass player of Belle and Sebastian, and that he had subsequently written his own novel in which Rankin turns up as a character who has written about Peacock in a book. \"I came across as a bit of a wimp,\" Rankin complains. \"But it was good. It was also, in current parlance, a mindfuck. You think, 'Hang on, if he's not real, and I am real, maybe he's real and I'm not real...'\" (Independent) ...more I did not find this book as good as some of the previous ones in the DI Rebus series. The plot, I felt, was too much like a Hollywood thriller and there was something distictly un-Rebus about the whole thing.

Finally, the ending left me a little disappointed. Might just be too many things getting wrapped up (more or less) too fast.

The book starts with DI Rebus lying in the hospital with two scalded hands while advising on a case while on suspension following a murder investigation being held against him for a man who was burned in his apartment.

But of course, DI Rebus pleads not guilty. But.. Is he really? Well, that's the question you'd have to find the answer to! The plot isn't something extraordinary. A shooter walks inside a school building and guns down two students, injures one. Ordinary, ain't it? But then, he shoots himself too. Oops! an accident? Buh! as if. But why would he shoot only two students when he could've shot a yard full of school kids out for recess? And why would he shoot himself? Sudden guilt? Why now? Another question for you to find the answers to! DI Rebus is by far the most intriguing officer I've ever read. Sometimes his reckless, laid back attitude makes me hate him but then the other moment his I-don't-give-a-damn, bad-ass, laid back attitude makes me love him more than anyone! What wouldn't I give to have that? I keep picturing him as some hot shot inspector in his late twenties or early thirties but everytime he does something sexy- we're reminded he's 62 years old retired army(Bugger!). And Shiobhan? She's clever but it's her confidence, her look-me-in-the-eye, I-won't-back-off attitude makes her my favorite female inspector of all times. Let's talk about the climax, shall we? Ingenious! I don't know a way to say this without giving it up but, the way he finally \"stood up\" to his father? LOL, that was something that had me cracking. For real. But it was so smart, you couldn't have guessed it at any point during the entire book. None of what happens could be. And who knew the two things could be so twistingly related!? If only so much. The book has some really interesting moments where Rebus and Shiobhan connects the dots with such brilliance it would've been impossible for us to guess. I'll give away this one thing about the book- Some answers you'll definitely get but some? You can only guess. My book came with this real interesting list of questions topmost being- how does Ian Ruskin reveal himself as an author interested in using fiction to 'tell the truths the real world can't'? Interesting question! I never heard that about the author before but when you think of it, wouldn't it require a person have to realize that Hyde and Jekyll personality within himself to understand that personality of the city he'd been born and brought up in? This piques my interest in the \"workhow\" of the author's mind! I wonder if Ian Rankin created Rebus all the while thinking of him as his alter ego- doing and saying things he can't or is too stubborn to face. Now that would be fascinating! ...more <---C>Detective</---C> Inspector John Rebus straddles the line of nice guy doing the borderline naughty things we fantasize about doing, and manages to keep himself out of serious trouble, although he does pay the price in small doses of hangovers or raised eyebrows from his superior officers or invective or physical incursion from those he treats uh, discourteously.

He doesn\u2019t suffer fools gladly, and only rarely bites his tongue to keep them at bay. Rebus and Siobhan Clarke, Scottish police officers take on another case in Rankin\u2019s steady hand, this time the murder of two students at an elite academy, the wounding of a third, and the suicide of the shooter. The culprit, a former member of an elite military unit, one that Rebus failed to qualify for, attacks the students in a schoolroom with no apparent motive. Enter the fray to find out that one victim is a relative of Rebus\u2019, there\u2019s a Goth girl student, an audacious politician, a shady character whose inspired wardrobe lives up to his moniker of \u201cPeacock\u201d, that man\u2019s rather simple sidekick, and the death of a man who was stalking Clarke, leaving Rebus as the prime suspect in his death. In the evolving investigation are implications of surrounding illegal activities, including guns and drugs and a group of street thugs. There are disagreeable military representatives who horn in on the case, and a varied lot of police personnel and logistical support people. That sounds awfully busy, but Rankin makes it work. Rebus is a flawed but good man, easy to identify with. Clarke is his friend and fellow officer and sometimes his conscience. The characters and their interactions and nice pacing in the interesting cities and towns of Scotland make this a good, entertaining read. For this American reader, the acronyms occasionally become distracting, and while Rankin ties things all together well at the conclusion, this mystery-lover was left with the modest feeling that there were not sufficient clues given to the reader to solve the murder. Those small failings aside, it\u2019s a clear reason why Rankin\u2019s Rebus books sell so very well. They\u2019re fun and entertaining. I will be back for more. ...more The 14th book in this wonderful series, and it is just as fresh now as at was at the beginning.

It was enough to keep me turning pages, and I had to stay up late to finish the book. That's Ian Rankin's Rebus does to me. This book also provides us with more insight into Rebus' past and family life. Rankin's skill as an author manifests itself in the book with extremely tight plotting and his extraordinary character development. Rebus continues to intrigue. I read these books for the great mystery, but also for the sharp portrayal of a character that has come to seem real to me. Rankin is a master at creating three-dimensional, realistic characters. All good enough reasons to justify, to me anyway, my addiction to this series. ...more This is one of the better entries in Ian Rankin's Inspector Rebus series, which in turn is one of the best crime fiction series going.

As is usually the case, Rebus alienates a lot of people along the way, including his own superiors and a particularly grating, publicity-seeking politician. Adding to the complexity of the situation is the fact that Rebus finds himself suspect in the murder of a petty criminal who had been harassing Rebus's partner and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Siobhan Clarke. Suspended for the duration of the inquiry, Rebus refuses to go quietly. Assisted by Siobhan, he continues to pursue the investigation while at the same time ducking his superiors and the investigators from internal affairs.

Rebus is just too offensive and impossible to work with. At the end (which is the worst type of ending for crime fiction as far as I'm concerned) I found myself convinced that he prevented more murders from being solved with his obstructionist methods than he solved with his \"genius\". I'm not going to read any more of this series! Really enjoyed this book, one of Rankin's better Rebus one's. The storyline is excited and well thought out and loved learning more about the characters other than Rebus. Terrific ending as well.... what happens next?! This book is seriously bloated. It could be reduced to a third of its size. Even at that, the story is not that interesting, and the subplot is annoying. While interviewing a shooting victim, he takes some of the kid's painkillers! What cop would do that? This is the first book I've read by Ian Rankin. He is very popular in the U.K. I always like a good mystery...especially this one because it is set in Edinburgh, Scotland. I enjoyed reading it and appreciated that it wasn't too graphic. This is a complex novel, filled with regret and desire for vengeance. Harrowing to read, but rewarding too. This is another one of my Friends of the Library book sell bargains. It was enjoyable. It has a good plot and characters are intelligent if a bit one-dimensional. Uh it was good but there certain types of mistakes and it was boring There has been a shooting at a private school in the small coastal town of South Queensferry near Edinburgh. A man has killed two students, injured another and then killed himself. The gunman, identified as Lee Herdman, turns out to be an ex-army loner. The common theory is he \u201clost it\u201d, like many who left the forces with memories of difficult experiences and killed the students he met randomly before turning the gun on himself. Rankin is sympathetic to this thinking. He too was in the military There has been a shooting at a private school in the small coastal town of South Queensferry near Edinburgh.

The common theory is he \u201clost it\u201d, like many who left the forces with memories of difficult experiences and killed the students he met randomly before turning the gun on himself. Rankin is sympathetic to this thinking. He too was in the military but failed to make the grade when he was trained for special duty, a failure which eventually resulted in a mental breakdown. Rebus also knows that the military, so intent on training their soldiers how to kill, does nothing to shut down those intentions when soldiers go back to civilian life, their returns marked by marriage failures, breakdowns, suicides and homelessness. So Rebus, sensitive to these issues, appears to be an excellent choice to work the investigation. It also provides him an opportunity to absent himself from his usual place of work, where he is currently under suspicion. Siobhan Clarke has recently been stalked and hounded by Marty Fairstone, a petty criminal who breaks into houses and has several convictions for assault. He won\u2019t leave her alone and she can\u2019t seem to shake him, becoming more concerned about his tailing and taunting. He has even given her a black eye. Rebus has offered his help, but Siobhan says she can take care of herself. Then, after a late night drinking session with Rebus, Fairstone is found dead in a mysterious house fire. When Rebus turns up the next day in hospital with terrible burns on his hands, suspicion is automatically turned his way. When questioned about his burns, he says he scalded his hands by tripping into his bath, a statement no one takes very seriously. Even Clarke begins to wonder if Rebus has crossed the line in trying to protect her. When Rebus is chosen to help with the murder suicide case at the school, it provides him an excellent opportunity to dodge the questions about his hands and his whereabouts the night of the fire. He leaves hospital as soon as he is able despite the fact his burns are painful and serious enough to require daily dressings. Unable to sit still, he is determined to return to work, but there are problems--he cannot make calls, file reports, make notes or even drive his car. Siobhan takes on the role of helping him by dressing his wounds and becoming his driver. She even helps him light his cigarettes, although reluctantly, mouthing the ignored advice that it would be a good time for him to quit the ugly habit. Initially it appears the school shooting is the result of a soldier's psychotic break. It is believed he entered the school, wildly and randomly aimed at and killed the first students he met and then shot himself. But Rankin is uncomfortable with this quick assessment and is not certain it is all so simple. Granted the man was ex-military and had left his wife and children, but why would a man who seemed to be leading a quiet life running a water ski operation, suddenly have a meltdown. When two army officers arrive to carry out their own investigation of the case, Rebus believes his suspicions are confirmed. There is more to this than meets the eye. One of the students killed is Derek Renshaw, whose father Allan Renshaw is Rebus\u2019s cousin. Rebus has not seen Allan in over thirty years, but he does have fond memories of throwing a football around a field when the Renshaw family came to visit his family years ago. When they reunite however, Rebus discovers his youthful memories are not shared in the way he would like to think. Once again Rebus feels he has failed his family. James Bell, the student who was wounded and survived the shooting, just happens to be the son of MP Jack Bell, a disreputable politician who had a recent run in with the police while negotiating the services of a prostitute. The school is located in Bell\u2019s constituency and Rebus is provoked when the man who he calls \u201ca sanctimonious bastard\u201d uses the publicity of the shooting to advance his political career. As Queensferry becomes a three ring circus of police, media and mouthy politicians, Rebus treats the MP as he would any other man, not as an aspiring politician, a fact which annoys his superiors back at the station. There is another question that arises about the shooting. Derek told his sister Kate that the Cotter family hated him. Their son Stuart was only seventeen when he was killed in a car crash in which Derek was involved. Teri, Stuart\u2019s sister, only fourteen at the time of the crash, began a goth phase shortly after her brother\u2019s death. Now she wears stilettos heels and fishnet stockings and seems obsessed with death. Is there a possibility of revenge in the shooting? Kate suggests to Rebus, that the Cotters may be connected in some way to Herdman, the shooter. Rankin skillfully begins to entwine the two seemingly separate events, the school shooting and Siobhan\u2019s stalker, providing opportunities to mine Rebus\u2019s past as well as the growing relationship between Rebus and Siobhan as they work together and separately to close the case. Rankin continues to give the reader new sides of his detective\u2019s character, a man he has painted as a loner with a divorced wife, a distant daughter and the loner lifestyle of a workaholic who drinks too much. This time he provides further details of the incident that broke Rebus during his training in the SAS, baggage he has been carrying for over thirty years and which Rankin has referred to in several previous books. Certainly the always careful but caring relationship between Siobhan and Rebus takes an interesting turn as he, physically vulnerable with bulky bandages and constantly downing painkillers, has trouble not only carrying out life\u2019s normal routines but also his calming habits of smoking and drinking. He has always been very independent but now is forced to rely on Siobhan to help with his meals, to drive his car and to trust he is telling the truth when he says that he did not kill Fairstone, the man who stalked her. The pair is slowly becoming more and more alike. Both keep to themselves with no one to go home to. There they listen to music, survive on takeaway food and drink alone. The fast paced and exciting conclusion in the novel cements their relationship even further. Rankin includes more indications that Rebus is aging as he has his detective referring more and more to his notes when giving evidence in court, something he never had to do ten years ago. With Rebus approaching retirement in the not too distant future, Rankin may be raising the question of whether Rebus will become Siobhan\u2019s coach behind the scenes after he leaves. Once again Rankin has given his fans another good addition to this very popular series. ...more Rebus books are pretty much my ultimate comfort read. He's a curmudgeonly character who fills that dour Scottish part of my soul right up every time, and I find myself periodically needing my fix when that tank runs low. 'A Question of Blood' was an enjoyable return to Rebus' military roots, only really previously explored in his first outing. Siobhan got a good turn in this too, although I felt (and I think she'd agree!) that was a little short changed by the ending.

The twist was good - although someone more perceptive than me might call it obvious, I suspect - and as usual Rankin's characterisation was exceptional. ...more One has to wonder how many times Rebus can be ambushed in the stairwell leading up to his place before he starts being on guard. It's an incredibly recurring theme 14 books deep, even if part of the point of Rebus is that he can be a slow learner. A Question of Blood features the unforgivably named Teri Cotter, but apart from that it's a solid entry.

It fleshes our Siobhan more as a character, sets Rebus a different & difficult case to solve & provides a great B plot with Rebus's injury. Solid, rewarding work by Rankin.
