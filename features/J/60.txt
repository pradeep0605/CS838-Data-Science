{"Comments": "This book is wonderful for children,<---M> young adult</---M>, and adults. I highly recommend for a fresh view of the familiar Christmas story. <---A>Michele Breza</---A> <+++>The Star</+++> Excellent children's book for Christmas. Unique story re-telling the birth of Baby Jesus. Vivid and engaging illustrations complement the book. This book is a SILVER MEDAL WINNER of the 2016 Illumination Awards! <+++>The Star</+++> is a delightful tale of a star looking for it's purpose and wishing to be great. The dark illustrations with their barely there shadow trees in some cases and their easier to see colorful pictures in others make the book. I also love that the book introduces several constellations and explains the Star of Bethlehem. I would definitely recommend this book to small children. (<---B>I received this in a goodreads giveaway.</---B>) The story was cute, however the design was dis-jointed. Some stuff was clearly clip-art style artwork from Adobe Illustrator mixed in with art other people had drawn. The font for the story was fine, but a terrible font was used in some of the illustrations. I did get this book from a give-away. The Star Michele Breza SILVER MEDAL WINNER in the 2016 Illumination Awards! I didn't like the illustration style. I liked the first part about stars and felt there was some sort of stigma at at the end about small and/or shooting star.<---F> I absolutely adored this</---F>. I gave it to my niece and nephew after reading it myself. Such a sweet story about a star with a very important purpose. A great story for around Christmas time.<---C>Michele Breza</---C>", "Title": "The Star"},
