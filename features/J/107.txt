United by a classical text called \"The Dream of Scipio,\" three men struggle to find refuge for their hearts and minds from the madness that surrounds them...in the final days of the Roman Empire, in the grim years of the Black Death, and in the direst hours of World War II. My Review: Pears explores well-trodden ground here...what is love, how does love cause us to act outside our own best interests,<---M> what does loyalty mean in the end</---M>, what relationship does the world have to the divine...through the lives and acts of three men widely separated in time, though united by the existence of a manuscript called \"The Dream of Scipio\", written by one, and read by the other two. The writer is Manlius Hippomanes, Roman aristocrat and chaste lover of the Alexandrine philosopheress Sophia; the manuscript is his final love-offering to the goddess of his idolatry, given after his faux conversion to Christianity which he undertakes in order to organize the salvation of his beloved Provence. In the time of the Papal Babylonian Captivity, also that of the Black Death, poet Olivier de Noyes discovers this manuscript, reads and fails to understand it, and consults Jewish philosopher Levi ben Gershon to come to terms with the many subtelties lost between the Roman days and his own, degenerate Christian era; thus comes Olivier to his fatal love for Jew Rebecca. And in the modern age, Julien Barneuve, French flaneur and Vichy-government fonctionnaire, writes draft after draft of his response to Manlius's manuscript, thinking all the while that he's analyzing and understanding the life of Olivier de Noyes, the object of his studies. All ends badly for each of these men, their lives, their loves, their very cultural roots are torn up, and grosser and grosser perversions of right and good thinking and living, fueled explicitly by Christians and their revolting religion, take hold and choke reason. Well, no one can say it's not a subject I relate to and support.<---F> Too bad it's such a mess</---F>. The task of keeping three stories aloft while making sure that each is adding to the others is a daunting one. I don't think Pears did an especially good job of it. The transitions between narratives, all in third person limited PoV, are not keyed to anything that I can discern. I readily acknowledge that I could simply lack the cultural referents and/or the subtlety of mind to recognize them. I simply found the movement through time to be jarring and poorly handled. But overall, this cautionary tale is one well worth considering. The role of \"faith\" in the decline of common sense in the public discourse is readily seen in our own time, and the horrifying results...teenagers bullied to death, consenting adults prevented from exercising their civil rights because of some ancient and culture-specific \"divine\" law irrelevant to modern times...surround us daily. Human beings cannot be trusted with piety. It's not something that becomes us as a species. It's quite the opposite of its stated goal, is piety: Instead of creating peace and harmony, it creates hatred and judgment. It certainly does so in me. And I am not a remarkable human being, but pretty darned average in my responses: I don't like people who don't like me. Religion, sadly, in the hands of human beings, doesn't make that problem better, but rather creates a horrible echo chamber for the least worthy and most common feelings to be fed back upon themselves. Woe betide those who try to stand against this noisy tide...Pears points up the futility of this, while making sure we understand its absolute necessity. I wish I believed that reading this book would change hearts and minds, so I could yodel a call to read it NOW from the housetops. It's too rareified, too precious, to make a general audience sit up and take notice. And it's not well enough executed to become the coffee-table adornment of the socially pretentious reader, either, so...here it is. Read it if you agree already, if not don't bother. And isn't that the saddest sentence ever.

In comparison, The Dream of Scipio - while ambitious just like its predecessor - falls a little short. The Dream of Scipio follows the life of three very different men, all of whom lived in Provence in three different centuries, during various times of great and important historical change: Manlius Hippomanes, a wealthy Roman aristocrat bound on preserving the Roman Empire from decay and destruction, as Gaul is lost to the Visigoths; Manlius is the author of The Dream of Scipio , a treatise on his decisions taken during that fateful period. Hundreds of years later, Manlius's writings are discovered by Olivier de Noyen - a poet and a scholar in the service of a Papal Cardinal, in the mid 1300's, when the Black Death killed one third of all population in Europe. Olivier's poems are discovered by Julien Barneuve, a classics scholar in the middle of the 20th century, as France fell to the Nazis during the Second World War. Each of these men has been placed in history's most tragic and defining moments; and each of them is powerfully, hopelessly, and fatally in love. This is not an uplifting book to read. Everybody in this novel is dead - the book begins with Julien's death in a fire, and both Manlius and Oliver have been turned to dust centuries before he was even born. Jewish suffering is a common theme, and the book could have just as well been titled antisemitism throughout the ages ; tracing the roots of the great tragedy of the 20th century all the way back to the early pogroms. Each of the protagonists faces a difficult choice, with no clear good outcome; and their choices permeate throughout the centuries, influencing lives of three seemingly disconnected and distant persons. However, all that said, the novel is not as effective as Fingerpost : the set-up is intricate and the narrative switches constantly between the three characters, which will make it hard to keep up for some readers, as there are no chapter breaks in the three parts of the text. I think that the structure of Fingerpost - each narrator having his own, separate section - offered a specific advantage: the setting for the book could have been established in much greater detail. In comparison, the three periods of France in The Dream of Scipio look awfully pale - there is just enough detail for us to know in which period the said section is taking place, but only barely. I wished to be fully transported into the time and place, as was the case with Fingerpost , but unfortunately it didn't happen. And since we know from the beginning that every protagonist of the book is dead, the novel lacks the sense of mystery that Pears's earlier book had in spades. In Pears's credit this might not have been his intention in the first place - rather he might have wanted to create a complex and byzantine book which would raise important philosophical question: can you preserve civilization with barbarism? What is the price we are willing to pay for our emotions, and ultimately - what is the meaning of life itself? These are good and important questions and this is a less-mystery driven, often diffcult but ultimately interesting book. Still. I'd recommend readers interested in Pears to start with reading An Instance of the Fingerpost . ...more This book tells the three most tragic and beautiful stories I have ever read.

Themis-Athena wrote a great review about this book. Some books we read for pleasure, some for intrigue, some for thought-provoking stimulus. Given the nature of this book--three interwoven stories across three time periods--fall of the roman empire, the black plague in 1350s, and WWII France--I find it required a lot of concentration--especially during my early morning commute and late at night.

Occasionally, I'd have to back track a few pages to figure out where some character or detail first appeared--not easy to do when the stories change every two paragraphs (and this from a former-academic). The stories and time periods are fascinating, and neo-platonism is sprinkled throughout, but I felt no real enlightenment on issues of Anti-Semitism, nor felt it was true that christianity was simply barbaric and blind faith--this in the late Roman Empire after Christians had been persecuted for years. I guess what I'm saying is that complicated things like socio-religious (even artistic) belief systems set in a historical time period were presented as too black and white. Bottom line--I enjoyed the cleverness of connecting the 3 stories, but this book fell flat for me at times. ...more So the other day Yann and I were talking about food (as one does here) and the in-laws.

I am happy to eat a kiwi which is placed in front of me, without objection or disgust, but I do not necessarily take great pleasure in eating them either. They're fine. They're moyen. They're edible, but I wouldn't cross the street for one. I am unable to successfully communicate this position to my mother-in-law, who dedicates considerable time to spoiling us both, particularly on the food front. She continues to think I don't like kiwi, and that I should never have to eat one, having only and always things I like better to eat (they are legion). In discussing the kiwi question with Yann, he suggested that this is perhaps a small but important cultural difference. He argues that the French, dedicated to good food and non-puritanical about the harmless pleasures of the body, see no reason why each and every thing you eat should not fall well above the limit of \"it's okay but not my favorite\" and belong instead to the category \"YUM!\" That, in fact, I should not have to eat kiwi when so many better options are available. That \"meh\" may not be the same as disgusting, but it's nonetheless not good enough. And indeed, leaving aside the case of finishing something so as to not waste food, which I do think is a virtue, I think he and his mother and the French are right, and I and the diet-shake drinking, mcdonald's eating, if you don't eat it now you'll see it again at go\u00fbter you'll eat it whether you like it or not choke it down already american model are, perhaps, wrong. Why do I talk to you of kiwis and in-laws? Because this book, my friends, is a kiwi. And I think perhaps it is time that I integrated, left book puritanism (I've never left a book unfinished no matter how bad!!!!) behind me, and ditched all that is not wondrous, delightful, delicious. I think it is time to take <---A>Iain Pears</---A>, and quite possibly the bulk of mainstream historical fiction, back to the library from whence it came, admit I won't finish it, blame neither the book nor myself, and move on with my life. I just counted, and this year, so far, I have met 15 new authors, all of whom have filled me with delight and happiness. I think my time is perhaps better spent with them. ...more This is that rare thing - a book I gave up on.

They are Manlius Hippomanes, living in the decline of the Roman empire; Olivier de Noyen living during the Italian Renaissance with the exiled papacy and Julien Barneuve a scholar during the Nazi occupation. I am familiar with the Dream of Scipio, but the novel takes it;s title from the reflections of Manlius who is cannonized as a Christian saint, regardless of his neoplatonic loyalties. Similarly his platonic or non consumated lover, Sophia is also revered as a saint, when she is acutally an echo of Hypatia, the philosophical queen of Alexandria. Their stories, completely rearranged by Christianity are picked up by the manuscript hunter Olivier de Noyen. His story is complicated by plague and persecution of heretics, Jews, etc. I have not mentioned his false history lest I spoil the novel, but at each opportunity we are confronted with the voids in documentation which would reveal the irrational side of history replete in the life of Julien. Prejudice is also pilloried here-why wouldn't you want to poison the well if your family died because of the well owners actions-the message here is the sympathy for persecuted people-each of the dead has it's own face and web of relationships. Each man makes choices based on his intellectual leanings and loyalties, but is also influenced by the women they love. Each decision leads to unexpected influences on the future. Great read-I am inspired to return to rereading the Instance of a Fingerpost by the same author and to seek out his other works. ...more Beautiful book that deals mainly with the question of how to preserve civilisation set in various times of great trouble, disease, war and stress.

Simply put, it is a wonderful book that, if you are anything like me, you will savor as the rare delicacy that it is. I literally forced myself to put it down several times in order to prolong the pleasure of reading it. My first Pears novel and already I am in awe of the fellow. I cannot think of the last book I read where parallels among characters were drawn with such subtlety and grace. We have a landowning philosopher turned Bishop in the twilight of Rome, a poet in the employ of a Cardinal as the Great Mortality reaches Avignon, and a historian in France as World War II consumes Europe layered atop one another in such a damnably intelligent and skillful manner that even the greats must hang their head and consider a career in technical writing upon discovering this bit of genius. Pears is seriously fucking good, and I intend to wait at least six months before taking up his An Instance of the Fingerpost so as to properly absorb the nuances of a text I finished back in June. As an aside, this is about the deepest I plumb when discussing plot in reviews; I naively read the back of Lovecraft\u2019s At the Mountains of Madness before starting it in early high school and have since developed a pathological fear of revealing surprises to the uninitiated when discussing stories of any medium. I know many people do not mind spoilers\u2014indeed, some incomprehensible sorts even court them\u2014but I have something of an allergy in their regard and do as most humans do in such cases; I assume everyone else shares my aversion. If you do not, or would ever simply like to discuss a work in more detail than I put forth in these brief critiques, simply shoot me an email. But Pears. Oh sweet breastmilk of a seraphim, Iain Pears. His style reminded me in the best fashion of a nonfiction historical writer\u2014no one in particular, just something about the narration engaged me more in a manner like Barbara Tuchman or A. Roger Ekirch rather than Umberto Eco. As far as the last goes, I assume much scholarship has contrasted Eco to Pears but that sort of thing strikes me as simultaneously simplicity itself in the broad and cruelly unfair towards two wholly different artists in the specific. Just read it and thank me later. ...more I loved this book.

The three stories of a fifth century Roman bishop, a Medieval court person and a twentieth century historian blend nicely together and have a tension brought on by three turning points in world history: the fall of the Roman Empire, the plague and the Holocaust. Tied together is the will to survive and the scourge of collapse. The three stories are really one story as the more modern person looks back on the Medieval person, who in turn examines the Bishop and each tries to understand their moral and ethical choices in surviving. History is about how each of us copes as the world turns (sometimes over us) and how it turns out later. Not everything is seen at face value. Tied together are three women central to each time period. Before the Roman became a bishop, he was a noble man who has a platonic relationship with a woman philosopher, who becomes a recluse and eventually saint. The modern-day historian falls for a woman artist who spends time in the Saint's chapel studying the art done by the Medieval artist Pisano. Her curse is she has Jewish parents and WWII begins. The Medieval court person serves a man whose ambition is to usurp the pope, who lives in Avignon, Clement VI and he also falls for a servant of a well-known and well-read Jew he is called in to help find the source of the plague. These interlinked time periods amazed me and sometimes I became lost in the stories. The story never becomes melodramatic and I enjoyed the philosophical arguments. I highly recommend this book. ...more El sue\u00f1o de Escipi\u00f3n trata el cl\u00e1sico y apasionante tema del papel de la cultura en tiempos de guerra.

Tras participar activamente en la primera guerra mundial y recibir una condecoraci\u00f3n por su servicio militar, Julien Barnevue, un intelectual franc\u00e9s nacido en Vaison (peque\u00f1a ciudad de la Provenza), retoma su investigaci\u00f3n acerca de la vida del malogrado poeta provenzal Olivier de Noyen (tambi\u00e9n oriundo de Vaison, nacido en 1322). Durante su investigaci\u00f3n acerca de los escritos y testimonios acerca del poeta en la Biblioteca Vaticana, Barnevue descubre un ignoto manuscrito intitulado The dream of Scipio (El sue\u00f1o de Escipi\u00f3n). El autor del manuscrito, Manlius Hippomanes, es un hombre de letras y arist\u00f3crata galo del siglo V que, con el fin de preservar la civilizaci\u00f3n y la cultura grecorromana, decide de convertirse en obispo cat\u00f3lico y luchar contra los invasores b\u00e1rbaros de su Provenza natal. Al caer Francia bajo el dominio alem\u00e1n, durante la segunda guerra, Julien abandona Par\u00eds, como consecuencia del llamado oficial de Marcel, un viejo amigo de infancia, de fuertes confesi\u00f3n cat\u00f3lica que trabaja en Provenza con el gobierno colaboracionista francoalem\u00e1n, conocido como el Gobierno de Vichy. Pese a las buenas intenciones de Julien por proteger a las v\u00edctimas del r\u00e9gimen, vali\u00e9ndose de las artima\u00f1as burocr\u00e1ticas y la desidia con la que puede desempe\u00f1ar su trabajo, Marcel lo chantajea para que le revele el paradero de Bernard, un mutuo amigo comunista y activo ide\u00f3logo de la resistencia, con el fin de entregarlo a los alemanes. Ante la negativa de Julien, Marcel denuncia la verdadera identidad de su compa\u00f1era sentimental, Julia Bronsen, jud\u00eda de nacimiento. Tras la deportaci\u00f3n de ella, Julien, quien incendia su casa materna con el fin de atraer la atenci\u00f3n de su amigo Bernard y evitar as\u00ed la celada tendida por Marcel, se inmola aprovechando el incendio provocado.

En efecto Ceccani aprovecha el terror de los ciudadanos y, tras culpar a los jud\u00edos de un supuesto envenenamiento de las aguas, convence a los feligreses de devolver el papado a su sede originaria. El poeta, con el fin de liberar de la calumnia su admirado fil\u00f3sofo jud\u00edo Levi Ben Gershon y a su sirvienta, de quien, pese a las diferencias es su enamorado, decide traicionar a Ceccani y denunciar el homicidio comepido por el Conde de Fr\u00e9jus, quien asesina a su propia esposa, tras descubrir el adulterio de esta \u00faltima con Luca Pisano \u2015pintor amigo de Olivier cuyo mecenas es, a su vez, el Cardenal Ceccani\u2015, dando la culpa tambi\u00e9n a los jud\u00edos.

His latest novel, \"The Dream of Scipio,\" is another category-buster, a work of such philosophical and cultural complexity that its greatest mystery is \"How can Pears know so much?\" Pears's canvas has never been larger (Western culture), or his concerns more profound (What is civilization?). Summarizing this complicated story risks intimidating readers away, but -- while it's good to be prepared for some work -- this is another wildly entertaining novel. He follows three historians in Provence at three moments when Western civilization seemed ready to shatter: * Manlius Hippomanes, the Bishop of Vaison, who struggles to slow the fall of Rome in the 5th century. * Olivier de Noyen, a poet and collector of manuscripts, who serves Cardinal Ceccani during the Black Death of the 14th century. * Julien Barneuve, a classical historian, who reluctantly works for the French government after the Nazi occupation in the 20th century. Pears has constructed a kind of literary Rubik's Cube, spinning these stories through each other in short chapters that produce fascinating patterns and parallels. All three men are captivated by the Neoplatonic philosophy of Sophia, a stoic Greek woman whose father was literally killed by the fall of Rome, when the ceiling of his classroom collapsed. At a time when classical philosophy is fighting weakly against the onslaught of Christian dogma, Sophia serves as Manlius's mentor. Even after his conversion, a merely political declaration, Sophia struggles to instill the logic of her ancient virtue. As a show of reverence, Manlius composes a dialogue called \"The Dream of Scipio.\" He hopes to demonstrate to his teacher how well he understands her radical notion that the soul is a reflection of the divine, trapped in a material body, eager to reunite after a journey of understanding. One of the dazzling pleasures of this novel is Pears's ability to follow the bumblebee flight of an idea through the ravages of time. At his death, Bishop Manlius's scandalous library is burned to protect his reputation, but \"The Dream of Scipio\" survives, mistaken for a Christian text. It's transferred to a church archive, where it sits for 300 years until that library, too, burns. But before that disaster, \"The Dream\" is transcribed, badly, so that Olivier de Noyen, a clerical courtier in the 14th century, can make a copy of it that ends up in the Vatican library, where Julien Barneuve translates it again as the Nazis destroy Europe. How each of these men uses the wisdom of Sophia to respond to their different, though equally terrifying, circumstances provides the intellectual axis that runs through the novel. But each story also revolves around a delicate romance rendered impossible by the crisis of the day. Sophia, for instance, is too removed from this world to give her heart to Manlius, and in any case, his political expediency repels her. In the 14th century, as the plague dissolves bodies and morals, Olivier falls in love with a servant girl, and in the 20th century, Julien is captivated by a Jewish painter. Pears handles these relationships -- like everything in this novel -- with extraordinary delicacy, capturing the full tragedy and beauty of thwarted affection. Each era is unimaginably different from the other, and yet in each, virtue is tested in remarkably similar ways. Again and again, anti-Semitism serves as the dry timber for a resulting holocaust. Manlius, Olivier, and Julien, so unlike in position and knowledge, must choose between their responsibility to those around them and their duty to those who will come after them -- even in the twilight of civilization, when it seems likely that no one will come after them at all. As the barbarians threaten to invade, Manlius reassures a nervous friend: \"We are the civilized world, you and I. As long as we continue to stroll through my garden arm in arm, civilization will continue.\" But 1500 years later, as German tanks grind toward the same spot, Julien takes a much more proactive view: \"Civilization needs to be nurtured, cosseted, and protected from those who would damage it.... It needs constant attention.\" By the end of this remarkable novel, all three men find the problem of preserving the best of their worlds vastly more complicated than they ever imagined. What keeps this cerebral story from pixelating into abstraction, though, is Pears's bifocal vision, an ability to perceive the precise details of ordinary life and the broad sweep of history with equal clarity. There's something sad and fascinating about his God's-eye view of how documents survive or don't, how history is recorded or lost, how truth is preserved or perverted. Each of these three story lines is so compelling that every break inspires a little regret that you have to leave one and a little thrill that you get to rejoin another. Civilization survives or revives in every case, but the hideous cost detailed here leaves little solace. This is a novel for our time about all time. Those who ignore Iain Pears are doomed to repeat the past. http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0530/p1... ...more What a perfect book. The Dream of Scipio opens with the death of one of the main characters, Julien, an academic who has spent much of his life studying one of the other main characters, Oliverio, who in turn had during his life a hunger for learning which drew him to study the third main character, Manlius. Julien was a soldier in WWI and becomes a bureaucrat in occupied France during WWII. Oliverio is a poet and a secretery for a Cardinal in Avignon during the time of Pope Clement before and a What a perfect book. The Dream of Scipio opens with the death of one of the main characters, Julien, an academic who has spent much of his life studying one of the other main characters, Oliverio, who in turn had during his life a hunger for learning which drew him to study the third main character, Manlius. Julien was a soldier in WWI and becomes a bureaucrat in occupied France during WWII. Oliverio is a poet and a secretery for a Cardinal in Avignon during the time of Pope Clement before and as the Plague strikes. Manlius is an intellectual Roman aristocrat and politician in the last days of Roman Gaul who writes the Dream of Scipio and is later remembered as a Christian saint. The different storylines fit so perfectly into one another, not only because one character investigates the others in the course of his desire to learn (Julien and Oliviero), but because all three men have similar challenges to meet. What is civilization? When is a compromise a victory and when is it a defeat? What is the value of friendship? What does eternity actually mean? What is love? Each man's life is changed by a love story which isn't quite possible because of the conventions of their time and the ambitions of those involved, but I felt that each was real and important. I felt that about all the friendships and rivalries in the Dream of Scipio, which is interesting because when I think about the book I don't see very many villains. I see people who are on the same side and are caught in a moment of history when what was status quo is being forced to change and become something other, and yet the personal conflicts of each story mostly arise from personality and character action. This book is just perfect. There's a literary and historical whodunnit aspect to Oliverio's tale and it is maintained until it's time to learn whodunnit. Manlius's decision to become a bishop in the Christian church (although he himself is Pagan) maintains a tension: What will happen? Will he manage to preserve the knowledge and learning that he wants to preserve? And Julien, well, we open with his death in a house-fire, and when we return to his death in a house-fire, it is perfect and heartbreaking. ...more Pears delivered an excellent novel, but I expected this when I picked it up.

The manuscript is inspired by a female philosopher, and in each subsequent time, each man is inspired to understand her teachings and the manuscript itself through their own work, their own love lives, and the political upheaval in each of their lifetimes. Pears has a way of writing about history while bringing something of poetry and love into his writing. As far as I know he never truly seems to write happy endings, which makes sense. When has history had a happy ending? But we get something of this in The Dream of Scipio, when in the end we realize that one of the greatest lessons offered by Sophia's philosophy is that the soul is eternal, and that love is a function of a soul, thus rendering it also eternal. Fated to meet again, and again. In turn, soul mates. It was a thought that consoled me and buffered the harshness of the ending for me. I also love how he wrote about what it means to be a philosopher in a time where it seems that philosophy is constantly pushed aside in favor of religious zealotry, or the materialism of politics. We are always asked to choose. To choose between a life of quiet study, the need to understand the seen and unseen, and the rules and laws of the unseen, if those exist, or a life of focused on materialism, the flesh and all that comes with it. For some reason, it's true that poets and philosophers are always asked to make this choice. I would recommend this book. Although I would probably double check a lot of the philosophical interpretations. This is still a work of fiction and not necessarily a book on philosophy. ...more This book has an interesting premise.

Manlius Hippomanes lives at the time of the fall of the Roman Empire, and has to decide how much he will compromise with the barbarians and the rising Christian church, to protect the classic civilization that he cherishes. He writes a philosophical treatise called The Dream of Scipio which the later characters reference in their own dilemnas. Olivier de Noyen is a poet and a servant of a powerful cardinal, at the time of the plague in the 14th century. His poetry is read 500 years later by Julien Barneuve, a scholar living at the time of the Nazi occupation of France. Each of them loves an unconventional woman and tries to protect her. Each of them is faced with the choice of whether or not to betray a friend and/or mentor. Persecution of the Jews figures into each of their dilemnas. The moral choices are serious and interesting, and the book did hold my interest. I definitely wanted to keep reading and see how it ended. But, I thought the execution was weak in a lot of ways. There was a TON of exposition in place of scenes that would have made the characters more real and appealling. Also, the transitions between the 3 stories were often awkward and confusing, and that made it hard to keep track of the 3 separate stories. ...more I started my summer with the hugely distasteful, \"Angels and Demons,\" by Dan Brown, his precursor to, \"The Da Vinci Code;\" and then, thankfully, strode into midsummer with the perfect antidote, \"The Dream of Scipio,\" by Iain Pears.

Where the former ripped through a fantasy-land of paranoia, the latter provides a deep exploration of wisdom, love, friendship, bigotry, betrayal, relative morality - and, well, a whole existential landscape. Mr. Pears uses the common literary device of telling three stories in three different historical periods. My usual response to this device is to prefer one plot line, or set of characters over another. Not so with \"The Dream of Scipio.\" I found myself lost in each story, and believed equally in each character and set of circumstances; and, without belaboring the plot Mr. Pears managed to hold the threads of similarity between each story with a masterful hand. My advice? Skip the blockbuster, and go for the lower profile offering. \"The Dream of Scipio,\" rewards with all the pleasures of an extremely well written tale. ...more UNCLE. I give up.

This took what felt like an eternity to read. The beginning is so slow, that I set it down and read two other books before picking it back up (which I did because I love the person that recommended it to me and respected that he wanted me to read it). About halfway through it did pick up, but with difficulty. It is a trio of interwoven stories following academic Julien in the 20th century (WWII) who is studying the poet Olivier in the 14th century (the black plague) who tries to figure out a philosophical manuscript written by Manlius of the 5th Century (the fall of the Roman Empire). WWII, black plague and fall of the Roman Empire should tell you all you need to know about the happiness of this book. There isn't any. It is one of the only books I've read in which all the heros and heroines are dead by the end of the book and some not in the kindest ways. (Think that's a spoiler? Think again. It's clear on page one that people are dead. (Again, a clue to the happiness of this book.) The difficulty in the trio of stories is how Pears skips from one time line to the other. Very often he neglects to name who the next section is about right away, so you read on thinking you are still reading about Julien when after a minute of confusion (which you really do not need in this richly philosophical and over-intellectualized book) you realize you're reading about Manlius or Olivier or vice versa. This is such a juvenile mistake in writing to me that I'm amazed at the numerous \"great book\" comments that covered the copy I had. The other problem was that I'd be getting into one story line and he would suddenly switch to another. I even found myself flipping ahead to see when I'd get back to the story I was interested in. The book is highly intellectual. The main characters are all thinkers. It is, to me, a study in how the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Which is more virtuous ~ killing one innocent to save many innocents or allowing many to die for the sake of one? Heavy questions, which at another point in my life I may have appreciated the journey of exploring more, but definitely not an easy read with three kids constantly interupting. (I could only concentrate on this book when there were absolutely no other interuptions - the kids in bed, the tv and radio off - hence the reason it took so long to read.) Why three stars then? What's good about it? It is an incredibly thought-provoking book. The juxtaposition, parallels and interweaving of the story lines is complex, fascinating (for any history lover, that is) and thoughtful. Not only did Pears have to think through the history of all the characters, he had to think through how their history could be misinterpreted by the generations that followed. This could not have been an easy book to plot and think through, let alone write. It may be worth reading just to see the skill with which he does it ~ the development and interweaving of history. At times I wondered how Pears could describe something with such seemingly accurate detail. I often found myself wondering which parts of this fiction were real, although his manner of telling it is sometimes distracting. Finally, I can see why my friend appreciated it and why he wanted me to read it. If I couldn't see that, then I definitely would have given this far fewer stars. I would like to think that I could get much more from it by reading it again, but frankly, I'd much rather move on to something else on my ever-growing \"to read\" list. ...more Here is another book passed on by my daughter and which I was very happy to receive, as I had very much enjoyed Iain Pears' The Instance of the Fingerpost a year or so ago.

All three men live in the area now known as Provence, all have a woman without whom their lives would have not had the same intense meaning, and all live in times when civilization as it was known to them is threatened with complete collapse. These three stories and their time periods are constantly threaded together throughout the book, but it isn't difficult to follow. There is so much to think about, as usual, and difficult to pin down what exactly the \"right moral path\" might be in horrific circumstances. Julien had survived WWI and says this: \"I saw things which were more appalling than you can imagine. I saw civilization coming apart at the seams. As it weakened, people felt free to act as they pleased, and did so, which weakened it still more. And I decided then it was the most important thing, that it had to survive and be protected. Without that tissue of beliefs and habits, we are worse than beasts.\" Each of these men is faced with decisions revolving around that, and sometimes the desire to \"save civilization\" leads to horrors as well.

In each of the three plots, Pears skillfully works in themes of love, anti-Semitism, religious fervor and its political misuse, individual choice, and the value of art. Some of the characters and events are historical while others are based on historical figures. The three recapitulations of the same general plot line make the reader wonder - and despair - over whether we can learn anything from history. As the book comes to a close, all three plots rush to their separate climaxes, disposing of their characters with a mixture of tragedy and heroism. In a book where titanic forces of history conspire to limit the options of ordinary human beings, the characters in the novel can nevertheless choose to respond with courage or cowardice, grace toward others or greed for power. ...more Was this really only 396 pp?
