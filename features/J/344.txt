Not only did I NOT feel like killing this book with fire , but I actually enjoyed reading it *gasps* Despite its Disaster Waiting to Happen Ingredients (DWtHI\u2122)! Wow. Imagine that! Flabbergastation is me (view spoiler) [ yes, flabbergastation is a word. Just in case you were wondering. You're welcome. (hide spoiler) ] I mean, I'm so used to reading UF rubbish these days, any Non-Crappy UF Object (NCUO\u2122) I manage to get my hands on comes as a shock. Hence the dramatic fainting and stuff . What ? You want me to cut the crap and get right down do the DWtHI\u2122? Why? You don't think what I've been saying so far is absolutely,<---M> totally and completely fascinating ? Okay</---M>, you know what, don't answer that one, I have a feeling I won't like what you have to say. But anyway. So you want do get down and dirty with no foreplay , huh? Sigh. You bunch of silly arthropods don't know what you are missing, but hey, it's your lives, so suit your little selves. Express Crap Cutting (ECC\u2122), here we go. So. Had I been my normal, healthy, balanced, sensible self when I read this story, I probably would have either rated it 2 stars or DNFed the shrimp out of it. Oh yes. Why? What do you mean \"why?\" Because of the DWtHI\u2122, of course ! Please do try to follow, my Little Barnacles, it would make my life a whole lot easier. Especially on days like this one, when you expect me to cut the freaking crap. So please shut the shrimp up , and let me try and to do this as quickly and painlessly as possible. There are two major DWtHI\u2122 in this book : \u2460 <---C>Rachel Morgan</---C> is quite the aspiring TSTL heroine sometimes. \u2461 Rachel Morgan has the most boring boyfriend in the history of boring boyfriends . That's it? Yep, that's it . What? You think these two little things alone are not reason enough to DNF the shrimp out of a book? Don't you know me at all? I've DNFed books with less than one freaking DWtHI\u2122 in the past, so believe me, my Lovely Arthropods, nothing is impossible in Kill it with Fire Land (KiwFL\u2122). So YES , our dear Rachel has TSTL tendencies, but I like her anyway . And yes, she has a Supremely Uninteresting, Slightly Annoying Boyfriend (SUSAB\u2122), but I'm fairly confident he will be appropriately disposed of in the next instalment, so all is well in the world. Or will be. Hopefully. Because if she Rachel doesn't ditch the guy soon, I shall gladly take care of it for her . Which loosely translates to mean: I'll chop him into tiny little pieces and feed him to the murderous crustaceans for the end of summer banquet. Ooooooh, I think my babies would definitely like that. Yum yum yum and stuff . Anyway, the answer to the question you didn't ask is yes, by the way . YES, I will continue with this series. Because it's pretty cool and fun and entertaining , despite the DWtHI\u2122. Because the story arc is pretty intriguing and stuff . And because Yummy Trent Kamalack is Yummy (YTKiY\u2122). And because Jenks is the hottest pixy ever . And I usually hate these suckers. Because pixies make me think of fairies and Fairies are Silly Sissies (FaSS\u2122). But Jenks is Jenks. So fatal attraction and all that crap . Oh, and one more reason why YES, I shall continue with this series: because demons are yummy . But you already knew that. And even if you didn't, just pretend you did. Good Little Barnacles. Daddy is so proud of you right now . \u00bb And the moral of this Express Crap Cutting Non Review (ECCNR\u2122) is: contrary to popular belief, I can be reasonable sometimes, and choose to overlook stuff I choose to overlook . Because if I didn't choose to overlook stuff I choose to overlook, I'd probably end up DNFing 99.99% of the books I DNF try to read.

Book 2 begins with Rachel and Jenks in the middle of a run. Several months has passed since the first book\u00a0ended, and without a death threat hanging over her head, Rachel is free to pursue her new career as an independent runner. Nick is now officially Rachel's boyfriend, and the roommate situation with Ivy seems to have calmed down now that Rachel knows what Ivy's triggers are and not to pull them. And things just keep swimming merrily along. (<-----did you see what I did there? *snickers*) Riiiiiight . . . Even if (for some strange reason) you were hoping things would calm down for our new favorite witch, when Glenn shows up as Rachel and Jenks' ride after the run (instead of Ivy), and insists on taking a detour to the FIB (Federal Inderland Bureau---the human version of police enforcement), it seems HIGHLY unlikely. Even MORE unlikely when you learn the reason for the detour is that Sarah Jane (Trent's new secretary) is there being questioned after reporting her missing boyfriend. A serial killer is on the loose in Cincinnati, you see. And serial killers have VERY particular tastes. This one has been viciously murdering ley line witches . . . and guess what Sarah Jane's boyfriend happens to be . . . SO many things happen in this book. Rachel shows an uncommon aptitude for ley line witchcraft. This is distressing for her, b/c as she has stated (on numerous occasions) she is strictly an earth witch. Ley line magic isn't as black and white as earth magic, and Rachel has seen too many friends slide down that slippery slope from white, to gray, to black b/c POWER lurks in ley line magic. POWER that tempts and overwhelms, and Rachel wants no part of it. We find out what Trent is. Not telling. READ IT. *poke* Rachel discovers links between her father and the Kalamacks. Not telling that either. *pokes again* And not lastly (not by a long shot, but if I were to list all of the Big Deal things that happened in this book, we'd be here all day, AND I'd probably get smacked from all the poking), Rachel makes a deal with a demon that sets up for book 3 rather nicely. And by \"nicely\" I mean \"holycraphowisshegoingtogetoutofthatone?!\" In addition to SO many things happening in this book, SO many characters are further developed and/or introduced. We meet Rachel's wacky mother (who accidentally alludes to a HUGE secret that gets revealed later on), and Piscary (hey, I just noticed \"scary\" is in his name . . . wonder if that was on purpose . . . hmmm . . . ), the scary master vamp. We also meet the several times mentioned, but never actually seen Quen (one of my favorite secondaries). Trent is shown in a less diabolical light that makes him a much more complicated individual, and Nick . . . well, Nick's moral code is revealed to be even more nebulous than previously suspected, but due to certain other events, I can't help but feel a bit sorry for him. That whole situation is just a MESS. And again MORE. Too much to cover all of it, but believe me when I say that it was very well done. There wasn't much on the world-building front, but then it wasn't really necessary. Pretty \u00a0much everything you need to know was covered in the first book. I still find it slightly ridiculous every time Rachel goes out of her way to hide evidence of tomato consumption from the humans, but what are you going to do? Tomato ridiculousness aside, The Good, the Bad, and the Undead brilliantly avoided the book 2 slump that so many series fall prey to. It was another artful combination of humor, action, danger, and flirtation, and BONUS all of this took place within a well-developed and identifiable plot! I know! It so rarely happens that I don't know what to do either! That's not true, I know exactly what to do---read the next book. *wink* My other reviews for this series: Dead Witch Walking (The Hollows #1) Every Which Way But Dead (The Hollows #3) A Fistful of Charms (The Hollows #4) For a Few Demons More (The Hollows #5) The Outlaw Demon Wails (The Hollows #6) White Witch, Black Curse (The Hollows #7) Black Magic Sanction (The Hollows #8) Pale Demon (The Hollows #9) The Undead Pool (The Hollows #12) Into the Woods: Tales from the Hollows and Beyond ...more I've read most of the majors in this genre: Stoker, Rice, Harrison, Harris, King, Hamilton, Meyer, Newman, and Kostova.

So, I think I've consumed enough of the vampire genre to have some opinions. My theory about Twilight. People with little to no experience with the vampire genre LOVE this series. Most readers who have consumed their fair amount of vampire genre - not so much. Somebody do a poll, quick, and prove me right. So why is Harrison great? Rachel Morgan is a sassy, sarcastic, kick-ass witch. Forget pointy hats, brooms and wands. Think leather pants, sexy boots and charms cooked up in a modern day kitchen. When charms don't work, a throat punch or round house kick will do. She's a bounty hunter who hunts down the bad guys - who are mostly non-human. Because of a genetically engineered tomato gone bad - half the world population died of food poisoning (basically). That's when the witches, werewolves, and vampires came out of the closet. Laws were formed to accomodate the different populations. Our girl s with the police for non-humans against human crimes, then she leaves because things go terribly and horribly wrong. It reads very Joss Whedon. Sarcastic banter. Kick ass fight scenes. The vampire \"rules\" are good - they make sense for modern day vamps in a modern society. What's to love? ACTION - great! MAGIC - good, different, makes sense, solid (I liked Harry Potter, but I like non-wand magic alot more) HUMOR - if you like Joss Whedon - you have to read this. CREATURES - there's more species than the three I've named. 'Nuf said. What's not so fun? That you're not already reading it! ...more The second book in the Hollows series is written much better than the haphazard style of Dead Witch Walking. I'm glad I stuck with the series because it's a really unique and interesting one. Firstly, it seems like the author has done with some good editing and slowly interweaves the world building with what is happening at the time, instead of having huge info dumps at random intervals.

I'm glad I stuck with the series because it's a really unique and interesting one. Firstly, it seems like the author has done with some good editing and slowly interweaves the world building with what is happening at the time, instead of having huge info dumps at random intervals. Rachel Morgan slowly learns to stand on her own and develop her powers further in this book. As an FIB consultant, she's assisting in a murder investigation using her strong intuition and witchy powers. The host of side characters such as Ivy, Nick, and Jenks are developed further and they are complex characters so it's interesting to follow. There's some interesting developments to follow in this book, and I especially find entertaining how tomatoes are feared by all humans due to them containing a virus that wiped out 1/4 of humanity. This book is multi-layered and has complex characters and developments, and it is easily enjoyable. I recommend The Hollows series to anyone who hasn't started it yet, and keen to start on the next one.

There is enough humor, mystery and other interesting characters to keep me engaged even when I want to scream at Rachel. A few things in this book I really enjoyed were her developing relationship with Nick, which let\u2019s face it now is probably doomed and not just because he is a human and Rachel\u2019s mom loves him\u2026 \u201cI like you. Marry Rachel and have lots of kids.\u201d \u201cMom!\u201d I exclaimed. Nick grinned, enjoying it. \u201cBut not right away,\u201d she continued. \u201cEnjoy your freedom together for a while. You don\u2019t want children until you\u2019re ready. You are practicing safe sex, yes?\u201d \u201cMother!\u201d I shouted. \u201cShut up!\u201d God, help me get through this night. She turned, one hand on her hip, the other holding the dripping spoon. \u201cRachel, if you didn\u2019t want me to bring it up, you should have spelled your hickey.\u201d But also because of a little/big thing Rtachel did in this book and a demon. Still I enjoyed their time on page together and their continueing relationship will be interesting if nothing else. The backstory development was really good too. We find out what Trent is, what his connection to Rachel is and a little bit of what her father was into. And then there is Ivy and that whole situation. It seems that everyone seems to see Ivy\u2019s motives aren\u2019t entirely pure except Rachel. \u201cShe wants something,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd every time she looks at you, I see guilt. Whether she means to or not, she\u2019s going to hurt you, and she knows it.\u201d I now have a little better understanding of Ivy\u2019s plans for Rachel and while I\u2019m not on board with them I could see the draw. There are exactly 2 reasons I\u2019m going to continue this series. Trent and Big Al Finding out what Trent is and part of his connection to Rachel was just a taste. I\u2019m sure and I really want to find out even more about this guy who seems to be a little bit good, a little bit bad and smoldering hot. Big Al on the other hand is probably all bad but in the best way, blame it on the Demon thing if you must. He is tricky and he has gotten the best of Rachel two times now, I have no idea how she will get out of this mess. The storyline of the serial killer of Ley Line witches was interesting and wrapped up pretty well, but overall I\u2019m more interesting in the overlapping plot arcs that will go on throughout the series, especially those centering on Rachel\u2019s Dad and Big Al. ...more I got so bogged down by the world building of the first book I put the series on hiatus. This time I switched to the audio format and it turned out to be a brilliant move as the narrator, Marguerite Gavin, gives an inspired performance.

However, by the end, I understand her more fully and why Rachel is so committed to the relationship. And, Nick...don't get me started on him. Still don't trust him and think there's quite a bit more to him than he lets on. Trent, well, he's the enigma that keeps on giving. There's a lot that works about this story, enough that I've dusted off the series and restored it to front row status. I'm grateful to friends who strongly urged me to keep going. It's a complex world with interesting characters and enough political intrigue to keep you completely off balance. ...more This review can also be found at Carole's Random Life .

I meant to but I guess I got distracted by other shiny books or something. Since I knew I need a refresher before moving on with the series, I thought that a re-read would be a perfect choice. I am almost positive that I liked it even better this time around. This book starts with a bang. Rachel and Jenks are in the middle of a run....and things don't go as smoothly as they would have hoped. One thing leads to another and before you know it Rachel is in the middle of a much bigger case and has a new human sidekick to go with the gig. This book really has a lot packed into it with a pretty compelling mystery at the heart of the story. There are a lot of side plots that also keep the story moving. I love the characters. Rachel is just all kinds of awesome. I like she handles herself in really difficult situations. She keeps an even head and can think about things from different points of view. She also tries hard to do what is right. Jenks is nearly perfect. He is tough and always seems to add a lot to every scene he is a part of. Ivy is still a bit of a mystery but I like the tension she adds to story. Marguerite Gavin is the perfect choice for narrator with this series. She is somehow able to capture each of the different characters in this book flawlessly. Each character's voice was unique and fit their personality. I was able to stay completely focused on the story and had a hard time setting it aside to do anything else. I think that her narration really made the story come alive. I would highly recommend this series to fans of urban fiction. I do think that this is a series that really should be read in order since some of the story builds on previous books. I can't wait to move on to the next book in the series. ...more I'll say it again. If you're fan of a good read with amazing characters with snarky retorts and sassy attitudes and you love yourself some action-packed urban fantasy then don't hesitate, do read this. I am most pleased by how this book turned out. It was a nice surprise that it kept getting better than the first novel and I actually liked it even more. Since I gave the first book 5 stars it's only fair that I give this 5 stars as well. There is a little bit more romance in this one. If you remem I'll say it again.

Since I gave the first book 5 stars it's only fair that I give this 5 stars as well. There is a little bit more romance in this one. If you remember Nick from the first book, well, he's Rachel's boyfriend and their relationship is kind of cute to read and I kind of like them together but to be honest I wouldn't mind if they seperated. There is a witch hunter on the loose. More like a ley-witch hunter and Rachel, Jenks & Ivy (from time to time) help the FIB, along with Glenn (Edden's son) to find out and apprehend the killer. Not surprisingly all eyes turn to Trent and Rachel tries to incriminate him for the killings and watch him going down. There are twists, many of them. There is tention between our characters & lots of unpredictability, which I liked a lot. Our characters aren't simple, they're complicated and they have problems and they're trying to work through them. I'm glad that this book changed my opinion about Rachel, which I grew to love in this one. In the first book I liked her but didn't quite find her as fascinating as I thought she would be. Ivy is still one hell of a vamp and I adore her and I hate how she's struggling and faces everything on her own. I want her friends to stand up for her, finally! This book was so fun, fun, fun. There is drama but all the fun drowns out the drama and I had a great time reading it, laughing and snorting. There is so much action, there's always action and it'll come right when you didn't expect it. Can't wait to dive into the next book and devour it like I did this one. ...more ACLARACI\u00d3N : Aunque esta rese\u00f1a tiene marcado 'spoilers' despu\u00e9s de cada \u00edtem, no suelo spoilear nada.

Just WOW. This book was so different from the first one. I loved it, I would have given 5 stars to it if it wasn't for that very, VERY slow beginning. I mean, the first half of the book I wanted to burn up the book because nothing really happened. It took me 4 days to read the first half and 1 to read the next. About that second half, I enjoyed it so much I couldn't stop reading it, even though I was full with work for college. What I loved the most about this book was that you see Rachel turn WOW!

What I loved the most about this book was that you see Rachel turn into a more powerful witch and a more grown up person. I really didn't like to see her bitten and so badly hurt in the first book. But in this one she totally kicked asses, LOL. About Nick, I really wish he just get killed or something, I seriously can't stand him.He's not good for Rachel at all. I adore Trent! He's my top fave for her, but Kilt isn't bad either. I wish she ends up with one of them. What about Glenn? What is he supposed to be to Rachel, I mean she just sees him as a friend but at one moment it looked like he wanted much more. So many boys to choose from. (Please let something bad happened to Nick,LOL, I'm sorry for those who like him, but I really, really don't) Now I can't wait to read the next, not after such an ending. If it keeps as good it could end as a new fave. Now I have really high expectations for the next, I hope it does not disappoint. ...more This is my buddy read of the Hollows series with Moonlight Reader.

The other characters are not smart, keep doing increasing dumb things, and are just awful. Besides the characters, the world building at this point makes no sense. We have another mythical creature coming out to play, and it makes no sense in the larger context of the world that Rachel lives in right now. Maybe if I cared enough I would have re-read some passages. However, there comes a point when you just want to be done with a book. I hit that point around 12:30 a.m. Told in the first person by Rachel Morgan, The Good, the Bad, and the Undead, still has Rachel reeling from the events in the first book. Now working alongside vampire Ivy as an independent agency, she is still focused on bringing down businessman Trent Kalamack. When some witch murders start popping up in Cincinnati, Rachel thinks this is her chance to tie the murders to Trent, and bring him to justice. The plot should have been fairly simple, but there were all these other plots (B, C, and I think a D in there as well) that were supposed to be part of the larger plot, but ended up making everything hang together badly. We have Rachel investigating a missing case, that then ties into some witch murders, which leads to a revelation about a demon, which is kind of linked to why Ivy keeps hulking out on Rachel, which turns to Rachel finding out about a friendship her father had with someone she hates, which is the house that jack built. I am being facetious here, but seriously, it was a long winding road to the end. It always sucks when you don't like the main character in the book you're reading. I really don't like Rachel at this point. Maybe it's because she's not that smart, and keeps apologizing to the wrong people when situations arise either of her own making or the other persons. And I can't stand to keep reading these books if every time Rachel gets out of sorts, it sets off Ivy, and then Ivy tries to feed on her by force and Rachel manages to save herself or someone else comes along and saves her. Long story short we have Rachel once again apologizing to Ivy once she vamps out and tries to force/kill Rachel. If it wasn't for Rachel's boyfriend Nick riding to the rescue, Rachel would be toast. And how does Rachel repay him? Are you sure you're all right? he asked, his hand buried deep in my hair as he held me. I pulled away to look at him. Yes. Thanks. Where's Ivy? He didn't say anything, and my face went slack in alarm. She didn't hurt you, did she? His hand dropped from my hair. She's on the floor where I left her. Nick! I protested, pushing myself away from him so I could sit straight. How could you just leave her there? If Rachel was a real life person and I knew her, I would probably be arrested for shaking the life out of her. Seriously? You don't have a problem that for the third time in three months your roommate has tried to force you to accept her enough so she can bite you? Bah to you. And I honestly don't know what Ms. Harrison was going for her in the longer context of this novel. Rachel is like a 2 year old that can be distracted by a bright shiny thing. Every few seconds I felt like she was feeling drawn to someone else and she was in a relationship. The ending with her having some sort of revelation about what happened to some mythical creatures just made me roll my eyes. Even broken clocks are right twice a day. I am sure that is going to be followed up in some subsequent book. Jenks and family were the only bright spots in this book. Can we get a spin-off with them? Maybe there is one. I will investigate. Jenks has more heart, more intelligence, than either Rachel or Ivy. And I love hearing about how pixies and fairies have been warring for centuries. I am way more interested in them, then the witches, vampires, and demons running around in this book. Nick who I was rooting for initially, is just as dumb as Rachel. (Spoilers for book one) In the last book Rachel found out that brainiac was summoning a demon. Because of this they both have demon marks on them due to Nick using the demon to save Rachel and the marks are seen as debts until repaid. Well we find out that Nick is still trying to learn from the demon and get it to do what he wants. And Rachel who has the common sense God gave a gnat knows this is a bad idea but you know, just kind of sits back and let's Nick do what he wants. Because of a mess-up because neither of these two are intelligent, there is a change to Nick and Rachel's relationship. The book leaves things up in the air, however, I don't care enough to see if they work it out. Trent from the last book is the only other character besides Jenks that I liked. Readers know (spoilers for book one) that Trent was behind a death in the last book. However, he's not an idiot and we find out what has actually been going on and it links back to the goings on in book one. The world building got a bit clunkier in this book. I think the problem was there were too many creatures to keep track of and what their triggers were. We had weres, vampires, pixies, demons, witches, etc. We also had some explanations of ley lines, and familiars. After a while I felt like I was being force fed an instruction book on witchcraft and got bored. The flow from chapter to chapter was a bit off in places too, and I think that things would have been better if there had only been that one plot that may have led to some revelations, but not everything that was thrown at us in this book. I have no further urge to read what happens in the Hollows. I am sure that somehow Rachel will get bitten by Ivy. Rachel will apologize for it. Rachel is probably going to end up with someone totally unsuited for her. And she will almost die like a million times. ...more Okay this book was a better than the first but it really took me a lot longer than is typical for me to get through the first half of the book.

There is no point in not having at least one or two problems solved in a book series. I always feel led on like a soap opera if there isn't some closure in a book. I'm interested enough in picking up a couple more books to see how this story goes. I have a feeling I'll be wading through the first half of the next book to get to the real story again but I guess I'll just have to wait and see. ...more Jenks is still my boy!!

The setting has a wide variety of paranormals: witches, vampires, pixies, elves, werewolves, and demons. I like the way they live, work, and interact with each other and humans in current day. My biggest problem is that I don\u2019t enjoy Rachel. She is reckless, impulsive, jumps to wrong conclusions, and makes mistakes. Those character traits are the source of her troubles and conflicts throughout the book. Some of it is stupid. In one scene she tells Trent she doesn\u2019t like him because he is a thief (and other things). Well, Rachel is a thief in this book which bothered me. A thinks B stole a fish. Rachel is hired to steal it back which she does. Then she finds out A was mistaken and B did not steal the fish. So I think Rachel should return the fish to B. She does not. She keeps the fish for herself. Yes ornery characters can be fun. In fact I love some of them in other books, but this didn\u2019t work for me. I couldn\u2019t like her, and therefore I could not enjoy her escapades. Other Rachel examples: A wants to take one of Rachel\u2019s books. Rachel says \u201cLet him have it.\u201d After A leaves, B tells Rachel now she cannot do the spell she needs because it was in that book. Rachel says \u201cOh.\u201d Rachel is in a dangerous situation and needs to do a chant. She gets distracted in the middle of the chant and says \u201cOh my God,\u201d then she forgets the last word of the chant, but she has already interrupted the chant, then several moments later she remembers the last word. Another problem: In every crisis, someone else comes along to save Rachel - at least in the first two books. She may do something weird trying to save herself, but it doesn\u2019t finish the scene. It reminds me of \u201cdeus ex machina\u201d (a god comes in to move the story forward when the writer can\u2019t think of another way out). The narrator Marguerite Gavin was ok.

THe \"hero\" Rachel Morgan, is that blessed kind that is easy to get addicted to. She has power and connections way beyond her own understanding. She is able to pull out of almost anything through basic instinct. She dives head long into things she only things she understands fully. Not unlike the beloved Harry Potter. These kinds of charecters are easy to follow because they don't understand. So when things are explained or they work it out, you feelinge you're doing it with htem and and not like a narrator is being forced to explain it to you. Now dont take the harry potter thing too literal. I just mean strictly what I said about. Inless an 8th book comes out where harry becomes a female version of a legal bounty hunter... Anway. This book was an excelent follow up to the first. I am still foudn wanting more. Not only are the charecters just as strong, just as exciting, but there are still new things to discover about them and the world were Inderlaners and humans live together. I give her a thumbs up also for putting a notch down on the cheesy. She replaced that notch witha notch up on the sexy. It is done very \"classy\" for lack of a better word and is important to the plot and understanding of the situation. Neat. I finsihed this installment as I did the first, simply wanting more. ...more Three stars, but a much stronger three stars than what I gave the first book.

Nevertheless, a buddy read pulled me back into the story about a year later and I\u2019m grateful to my buddies as the book improved a great deal in the second half. Harrison\u2019s world building is very engaging. The dichotomy between humans and supernaturals and the distinctions between the various species makes for interesting reading and raises intriguing questions for future installments. The plot revolving around Rachel\u2019s investigation into the disappearance and apparent deaths of several ley line witches develops slowly as new characters are introduced and the suspect pool expands. That said, the action heats up at the halfway mark and the climax and resolution are ultimately exciting and satisfying. Rachel is an intelligent and resourceful heroine, but her relationship with Ivy is seriously disturbing. Although Rachel\u2019s sympathy and loyalty toward Ivy is understandable, Ivy is constantly overstepping the boundaries ostensibly out of a desire to help, but its seems more like an attempt at seduction. Moreover, Ivy\u2019s aggression and Rachel\u2019s feelings of guilt and remorse reek of abuse and a form of battered wife syndrome. All of this has a rather distasteful feel to it and puts a damper on an otherwise compelling story. Nick and Rachel\u2019s romance is another problematic issue. Nick definitely has his own suspicious agenda and the developments in his characterization in this book do not bode well for the future nor do they endear him to me one iota. Hopefully, he is on his way out. On a more positive note, the mystery of Trent and Rachel\u2019s connection, as warped as it seems at the moment, is the most captivating aspect of this book (and the first). Trent is a fascinating character. The more I learn about his enigmatic identity and morally ambiguous business dealings, the more I want to know. Thus, getting to the roots of his contentious relationship with Rachel and discovering what lies ahead for them both is what keeps me interested in continuing with the series. All in all, not a bad read despite its problems and the unanswered questions have me eager to read the next one. ...more I'm giving this book 3 1/4 stars - but it didn't start at that level - I had to drag myself through the first third of this book that I definitely consider 2 - 2 1/2 star reading. It's only because I liked the first Hollows book so much that I had the faith to push through so that I could get to the last 2/3 of the book - the last part more than made up for the first.

What I didn't like: Oh God - I hate and deplore the titles of this series - ick - spoofs of movie titles. What is with urban fantasy authors? Kim Harrison is not the only author in this genre doing this - The Good, the Bad, and the Undead isn't even the only vampire novel with this exact same title. Please - urban fantasy authors - don't make me embarrassed to buy your books or check them out from the library. Really, I completely understand having a sense of humor about your work - but ugh - titles derived from movies is just stupid and unimaginative - and - at least in the case of Kim Harrison - the books are neither. Also - I'm getting tired of vampires - titillating as they are with their sex, pain, tortured souls, dominance/submission issues, and stupid vampire/ high school politics. I actually started this series to take a breather from vampires (I'd just been on a Charlaine Harris/ Laurel K. Hamilton/ Stephenie Meyers binge). What I liked about the first book in this series was that it focused on the witchcraft; the vampires were secondary. Vampire crap is more center stage in this installment - I was really hoping that the undead in the title was referring to zombies - seriously. It bothers me that sex and intimacy are so often depicted as power struggles(in popular lit in general not just in this book) - not that it's not fun - believe me I can trip on the Laurel K. Hamilton as much as the next girl - but whatever happened to harmless, sexual romps where nobody's soul was in peril? Yes, I know, I should stay away from urban fantasy if that's what I want. Somewhere along the line it was as if political correctness dissolved the human bad boy in pop lit - we (women and girls) are supposed to only be attracted to sensitive boys now - but getting rid of the human bad boy/girl only brought him/her back stronger and more violent - now disguised as vampires and werewolfs. OK - I digressed and I'm ready to get off my soapbox and finish talking about this book. The strange - sort of sexual - sort of not - dangerous relationship between Ivy the vampire and the book's protagonist (a witch), Rachel is getting old. Rachel says she doesn't want Ivy to bite her and make her a vampire play thing - but why does the character do so many things (training and sparring) that bring her into such close physical proximity to Ivy? Sometimes it even feels as if the author is conflicted about which way she wants her character to sway. Rachel is depicted as clearly knowing her mind about her sexual preferences (male) and her feelings about vampire relationships (\"friendship\" but nothing more) but why are the scenes between Ivy and Rachel as Ivy wrestles her vampiric urges to seduce and bite Rachel the most sexual and emotionally intense? The actual sex scene between Rachel and her very lame, human boyfriend, Nick fizzle in comparison. What I liked about this book: All the magic stuff - cool very cool. All of the scenes with Big Al the demon. All of these things keep the last 2/3 of the novel zipping along with a lot of excitement and intrigue. And of course there is Jenks, the pixie. At the start of the first book I thought I was going to find him trite and annoying, but Harrison has done a remarkable job of fleshing out this character and fantasy species in an original way. In Harrison's world, pixies are not at all what you think they should be. And truth be told, Jenks has become my favorite character. And then there is the matter of Rachel. The main character is just - well - stupid. As clever a witch as she is, she is just empirically and without question - stupid - both in her ill-planned actions and poorly thought out conclusions. You might think that this would be a draw back in a main character - not really. It's refreshing to have a character that is not perfect - she's not by a long shot the biggest bad ass in the room - in any room for that matter (and those of you who read the Anita Blake series will know what I'm talking about). She's not super smart, super talented, super strong (well she is a little she has been working out with a vamp), super cocky or- the gods save us - super good (like our morally superior, holier than thou Bella Swann who can make loosing your soul to become a vampire seem like an ascent into angel-hood). Rachel Morgan is deeply flawed - just like the rest of us. To me, that just makes her more accessible and more interesting. Also, her stupidity leads to some interesting hijinks and some interesting situations where she is able to prove herself. I don't need my heroines to always make the right moves and say and do exactly the right things - I like that Rachel Morgan can trip and bungle her way through danger but somehow turn her graceless fall into a super cool ninja roll halfway to the floor. Will definitely be reading the next one:) ...more I see now why this series has such a huge following. This book was worlds better than its predecessor. After reading Dead Witch Walking, I was on the fence about whether or not I would continue this series and I'm glad that I moved on to the second book (and will definitely be finishing the entire series!).

Rachel is pulled in as a consultant for the FIB, helping them on a case where witches are being murdered. Naturally, because of her former IS status, she is not only recognized but also meets her fair share of people who simply dislike her for being both a witch and a former IS employee. She also still holds a major grudge against councilman Trent Kalamack because of what happened in the previous book, and she hopes like hell that this case will be the one that finally topples him. Rachel is still broke and she still has her qualms about her roomie status with Ivy. As far as the writing and storyline for this book vs the last - so much better. There weren't any lulls in this one, everything that happened was something interesting. And there were also some very surprising elements and twists thrown in that I didn't see coming. Did I mention surprising? One of the things that irked me about the previous book was the relationship between Ivy and Rachel. It was a constant battle with Rachel always wondering if this would be the time Ivy attacks/kills/maims/whatevers her. Luckily, there wasn't quite as much tug-of-war with Rachel's emotions towards Ivy, and there was also much more clarification as to why Rachel would feel that way most of the time. Vast improvement, I fully 'get it' now. The characters are also a big plus to this series. I really enjoy them for the most part, and without the notable ones (Kisten, Jenks, Rachel to name a few), this series most definitely wouldn't be the same. It's always so enjoyable when you find yourself really connecting and liking the characters, it makes the experience that much better. I also still like that Rachel isn't fully kickass. Sure, she can kick some ass, but she still makes mistakes and still fumbles at times. That is what makes me like her so much, she's 'normal' for being so not-normal :) I'm really glad I took a chance and purchased the bulk of this series at once. If you read the first and find it's hard to get through and maybe not your thing, do yourself a favor and read through to the second before deciding on whether or not to continue the series. It makes all the difference, at least it did for me. ...more I was able to read Dead Witch Walking and this book back to back, allowing for a smooth transition into Rachel's second adventure. She is free of her contract now but still seemingly facing death every day from many different sources: Were's who want their property back that she stole, Trent Kalamack, who she suspects is once again the bad guy in her main case, Piscary, one of the oldest and most powerful vamps in the city, her human boyfriend who can't seem to resist the urge to keep summoning I was able to read Dead Witch Walking and this book back to back, allowing for a smooth transition into Rachel's second adventure. She is free of her contract now but still seemingly facing death every day from many different sources: Were's who want their property back that she stole, Trent Kalamack, who she suspects is once again the bad guy in her main case, Piscary, one of the oldest and most powerful vamps in the city, her human boyfriend who can't seem to resist the urge to keep summoning a demon, and even her vamp roommate, who is waging a war against herself to resist the urge to drink blood after being on the wagon for several years and has a hankering, now and then, to sink her teeth into Rachel's throat. This story is much more structured and tighter nit than the first story, which introduced us not only to Rachel but to her world where witches, vamps, and plenty of other creatures are real and the humans in the world have to cope with them. The world, both at large, and inside Rachels own existence, continues to get fleshed out and more complicated here. The author has done a great job at weaving a nice little mystery. There are plenty of different things revealed during the course of the plot that will satisfy a reader who was left wanting to know a lot more about Rachel and the other characters in the introductory novel. While there are plenty of answers, there are even more promises of things to come with the ever more complicated arrangements Rachel has with her roommate, her boyfriend, a certain demon, and Trent, a man who seems to confound and puzzle Rachel but also is a good foil to her that I look forward to seeing in future books. Jenks, the Pixie with an attitude, remains my favorite character in this book, though he is not as involved as he was in the first story. He is still the most likeable and most sly member of the cast and has a lot of fun with Rachel and everyone else he comes upon. Definitely no sophmore drop off for the author here, this is a great continuation of the Hollows series. ...more I like the concept of this book, but I'm finding it difficult to relate or even sympathise with a Main Character who just willingly and stupidly throws herself in the worse of situations to the detriment of just about everyone around her. *happy sigh* This books makes me happy. One of my favorite endings... And favorite books in the series, period. So much Trent, Kisten AND Al greatness (yes, I am aware of how that sounds). And I LOVE re-reading this at a slower pace and enjoying the ride, especially knowing what I know now... I liked the book okay, and would give this 3 Stars.............. if Rachel just weren't so bloody stupid. She is so darn idiotic and incompetent that it's painful to read at times. 4.5 stars Book Reaction (not a full review) Somebody's killing ley line witches, which is probably not a good thing, so the FIB hires Rachel to investigate, despite the fact that even she knows that she has absolutely no aptitude for detective work. Rachel still has her demon-mark, her boyfriend is dabbling in demon magic, and the demon is lurking around and playing the Generically British Evil Tempter, and Trent is behaving even more suspiciously than usual.

I'm still enjoying these books, although I think a lot of it has to do with Marguerite Gavin's spirited narration and pleasant voice. Harrison's prose isn't too bad either, even though I'm not fond of the Instant Synonym Replay or the odd phrases such as \"a smile crossed me\" or \"a frown crossed him.\" Unless Rachel's legs and torso start warping every time she grins, the smile is crossing her lips or her face, not her entire body. I'm still really enjoying the worldbuilding. Intriguingly, apparently society really did crumble, and the term \"serf\" is not hyperbole. I was a little disappointed to see a promising plot arc closed so quickly, even though several new ones have been created. In fact, Rachel's newly-retconned backstory make me suspect that she's going to turn into a Chosen One. There's also a certain amount of series continuity error. For one thing, Harrison seems to be backpedaling and turning Trent into a Misunderstood But Ultimately Redeemable Bad Boy. Somewhere between the last book and this one, interactions with demons became commonplace enough that they teach classes in it and demon marks are easily recognized, which contradicts the whole \"no demons have been seen since the Turn\" bit of the last book. My issues from the last book have only been amplified here. As with any vamp-oriented universe, there's a weirdly glamorized portrayal of rape, but in this case, Harrison also continues to pile on the victim-shaming. At one point, Rachel fights back aggressively during a sparring session, triggering Ivy's vamp mode. Everyone's reaction is to suggest that Rachel must really \"want it\" because she's so obviously \"asking for it.\" It's Rachel who is blamed and Rachel who ends up apologizing. By the same logic, if a woman contradicts her drunken husband, she must really want to be beaten and raped into submission, so it's all her fault, right? (view spoiler) [I know Piscary's attack on Ivy is accurately viewed as rape, but I'm disturbed that the similarities between Ivy's rape and Ivy's attempts to rape Rachel go seeming unnoticed. (hide spoiler) ] Overall, even if I'm not thrilled by the vamp aspect, I'm definitely enjoying the series--and the narration--enough to try out the next book.

In this installment, Rachel is trying to set herself up as an independent runner, but for the most part failing miserably. She continually gets stiffed by her employers. Nearly broke, she accepts a job as a consultant for the FIB. They're trying to solve missing persons report and a string of ley magic related witch murders. The missing man just happens to be connected to Trent Kalamack; Rachel's hate object numero uno. Naturally, Rachel's keen to take Kalamack down for good. This time however, Trent Kalamack's and Rachel's past may hold the key to both the murders and why they were attacked by the same demon in the first place. This unknown enemy poses a bigger threat to them both than they previously thought. And a common threat makes for strange bedfellows... The characters continue to beguile me. They are often dangerous, scary, deceitful and enigmatic, but never boring. Just the way I like them! The focus on Ivy-Rachel and Ivy-Piscary, were just some of the highlights. And you know what they say about old \"uncles\" who take an unusual liking to their younger, favorite granddaughters/nieces? Better watch them, because they're usually up to no good. And on that note: Someone please call living vampire protective services, because one scene in particular was especially creeeeeeeepy:-/ The way this impacted on Rachel and Ivy's relationship was really sad. I felt for them both, because I love their unique, sometimes shaky, friendship. As for Big Al, where do I start: Well, I loved him. He's a demon, but claims he's no sadist? Huh, I thought they killed trespassing humans and witches alike. Isn't that sadism? Maybe not to demons... I loved his unique blend of old world manners, coupled with his crude affinity for well hung vampire guises and not so subtle threats to make Rachel his: body and soul (sex included.) God, I have an unhealthy obsession with demon bad-boyd, don't I? (I'm doomed!) Granted, he has ulterior motives, but I'm pretty sure he'll become a favorite of mine. Oh yes, this book deserves a full five start. No doubt in my mind there:-) Don't believe me: Well, read the ketchup trafficking scene one more time. If you're still not convinced, you must have been infected with the T4 angel virus, and it's killing your sense of humor. Because it was fun! \u2665 it! ...more Posted on Under the Covers Rachel Morgan can\u2019t catch a break.

Several witches have been found dead and Rachel has this gut feeling that Trent Kalamack is behind this. After all, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time Trent had tried something mischievous and manipulative to get what he wants. As Rachel gets to work with Detective Glen, readers come to see a much more passionate side to Rachel. Flipping through the evidence files, the blood and gore is too much for even a witch like her. I loved this part because it not only showed readers a compassionate side to Rachel, but also displayed nicely that she isn\u2019t above all this. I enjoyed seeing her determination and her eager need to take Trent down. It isn\u2019t simply to take revenge on what he did to her in the last book. Kim Harrison weaves an intricate plot in THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UNDEAD. Though Trent infuriates me sometimes, there\u2019s also something very magnetic about him. Readers can\u2019t help but wanting to know more about him. Who he really is is still up in the air and I love the way that Harrison plays this out. Each book in the series reveals just enough to keep readers entertained without giving too much away. Nick still makes me nervous. I like him, but there\u2019s something about him that causes me to question everything he says. I\u2019m eager to find out what happens with the human. The Hollows has become a world that I have been wholly invested in. I can\u2019t wait to find out what happens next! ...more There are parts of this book I'd rate a five, but there are parts I'd rate a \"two\". I love the magical world the author has created, I love the Rachel Morgan character most of the time, Jenks the Pixie and his family are awesome, and she's generally good at creating suspense.

There are parts of this series that are too repetitive, though. Who else is sick of reading, for the 30th time, about Rachel walking into a room with a vampire in it and turning into a puddle of helpless lust because of her vamp scar? Once per book is plenty. But it happens time after time in each of the first two books. Who's sick of reading about half a dozen physical fights per book, with Rachel's vampire room-mate Ivy attacking her and struggling to restrain herself from sinking her fangs in? Also there was a part in this book where Ivy kept moaning \"I said no\" - not going to say why, of course -but she kept repeating it for about three pages. Also I can't stand the Ivy character so far. Also, while Rachel's boyfriend is a nice guy, he's excruciatingly dull. Bad boy boyfriends are way sexier. And yet, the writing and the world-building is excellent enough that I've kept reading even though it has some MAJOR issues that annoy the heck out of me. So far, I like Ilona Andrews and her Magic Burns, Magic Bites, etc., series more, because I like the characters better and she doesn't have that annoying habit of repeating a scene (vampire-lust) again and again. ...more", "Title": "The Good, the Bad, and the Undead"},
