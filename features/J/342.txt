And so we arrive at the finale to the wonderful Shadow series on the heals of the tumultuous events of the previous three books, Ender's Shadow , Shadow of the Hegemon and Shadow Puppets . For those that have not read the previous installments, there will be some spoilers below as the plot summary alludes to events that have occurred in the previous books. However, I will avoid spoilers for this book and will try and be as general as possible in the synopsis. This book concludes shortly after the conclusion of Shadow Puppets with the fall out from the momentous events of that story being felt around the world. <---C>Peter Wiggin</---C>, Hegemon of Earth, is trying to strengthen his fledgling \u201cFree People of Earth (FPE)\u201d and turn his figurehead title into a reality. Like the previous two novels, the central plot plays out like an enormous version of the boardgame \u201cRisk\u201d with Peter\u2019s FBE competing and maneuvering against China, India, a revived Russia and a newly organized Moslem Empire. Each of these powers is being ruled or controlled by a former member of Ender\u2019s Battles School \u201cjeesh\u201d and it makes for some fascinating move/countermove scenarios. In addition to the main story, a significant subplot is Bean trying to find a cure for his condition, known as Anton\u2019s Key, which continues to make him smarter and larger to the point where his size will soon kill him. In addition, Bean is frantically searching for his missing \u201cchildren,\u201d the fertilized embryos previously stolen. While I did not like this as much as the previous books in the series, I still thought it was very good. The geo-political landscape of the future Earth of this series is such a fascinating place full of subtle intrigue and shifting alliances that it makes a great backdrop for the stories. I think Card did terrific job setting up this credible alternative future. Through all 8 novels in the Ender/Bean series, Card, in my opinion, has not written one below \u201cvery good\u201d and this installment is no exception. The writing is excellent, the tactical/strategic plot elements are very well done and the dialogue between the \"gifted\" characters is terrific. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! One final comment I thought would share. I find it interesting that both the Ender series and the Shadow (or Bean) series have followed the EXACT same pattern as far as my level of enjoyment. I loved the first books (Ender\u2019s Game and Ender\u2019s Shadow). I loved the second books substantially MORE (Speaker for the Dead and Shadow of the Hegemon). I then loved the third books of both series more than the first but not as much as the second (Xenocide and Shadow Puppets). Finally, I really liked but didn\u2019t love the fourth (Children of the Mind and this book). If nothing else, OSC is consistent.

No one really annoyed me in those two books. I can't speak to the remainder of Ender's series because I got so bored listening to Speaker for the Dead that I set is aside for a bit. I've finished off Bean's series with this one and phew, thank goodness it is over because I don't think I could've read/listened to another one. Why do I keep doing it? Good question.

Answer: Because I do enjoy OSC's writing when his characters aren't talking about religion, military strategy, or BABIESBABIESBABIES. And the readers for his books are absolutely fabulous. I wish I could just have them walk around with me and narrate my life. Then again, I'd probably be lulled to sleep a little too much. As you can see by the graph, my annoyances hugely increased from Book 1 to Book 3. (I listened to them out of order) It was only downhill from there. NOTE: The 10% I don't find annoying don't really make appearances in this series--Ender and Valentine. ...more March 2010 Previously: Shadow Puppets Oh, the suspense is killing me. Bean is dying!

Ender\u2019s Shadow was interesting, I suppose, if you really wanted to know what happened behind the scenes of Ender\u2019s Game , but that was about it. Bean was slightly interesting, when he was still a tiny child genius one-upping all the stupid adults, but the novelty of that wore off. Even when he became a doomed and not-so-tiny genius with a mortal enemy--a mortal enemy whose danger to the main cast was usually reported secondhand, I might add--his little (or not-so-little) adventures still weren\u2019t worth reading, except when they were the adventures of other people too. But just barely. Thing is, the real story in the Shadow series is about Peter Wiggin and his road to the hegemony. And Card nearly got it right this time! Almost. We finally get to see Peter unite the world in this book; however, it\u2019s all just backdrop to the real real story, starring Bean and his wife Petra, which is about how families and love and having children and Mormonism are wonderful and Islam is stupid . Whatever. I get it. Couldn\u2019t Card have dropped Bean entirely and just told a story about Peter coming out from the anonymity of the Net to enter politics, eventually becoming Hegemon, and eventually using his nearly-useless office and title to form a world government uniting peoples instead of governments? No? Aww. That would\u2019ve been an interesting story. So all that was a bust. And yet I\u2019m still tempted to read the last few books and stories in this useless series, especially A Very Ender Christmas . Somebody stop me. Next: Shadows in Flight (Unread) ...more This is the fourth of the Shadow books, and in it, Card picks up the question of what happens to a lot of young people who have never known anything but war, as Ender's Jeesh and other key Battle School graduates take their places among the heads of state.

It's thoughtfully done, if not carried to great personal depths in every case; so much happens in this story that a lot of the political maneuvers simply have to be summed up, and some of the important character development happens in just one or two scenes. Card has quite the knack for doing great things with lone scenes, however. Of those great lone scenes, I was surprised at which characters' big moments affected me the most. This was Bean's book, and Petra's, and yet I have loved Bean and Petra for five books. I did not expect to love Peter. That astonishing little delight provided for a hefty share of the sweetness in the bittersweet ending, and in some ways, this was his book as well. The narrative hops perspective a lot, giving the reader sight into the various Battle Schoolers' struggles to shape the world and their own lives; it focuses on Bean and Petra, but Peter's genius and his motivations, his hard work and his healing are the central tale. As for the Battle Schoolers' struggles, Card structures the military movements with outstanding logic, best as I can tell; he appears to have done his research thoroughly on the various countries involved, and everything from motive for action to the playing out of battle upon available terrain seemed thought-through and believable to me. Someone more knowledgeable of strategy than myself may catch mistakes, but the only thing I saw that resembled a flaw was in how briefly big events had to be summarized\u2014probably a consequence both of word count limits and the fact that not every active country had a Battle School graduate to follow around. But that abbreviating of key events was well made up for by the thoughtfully optimistic perspective on life and humanity that carries Card's work. If Shadow Puppets came off slightly moralistic, <+++>Shadow of the Giant</+++> reverted to true <---A>Orson Scott Card</---A> empathy and brilliance. The comprehension of human nature and culture, the compassionate philosophy, and the powerful, ever-hopeful drive toward light and redemption are overwhelmingly beautiful even amid grief. And there is grief in this book. This is a tale of hope and happiness and suffering together, and it was both the sorrow and the beauty of it\u2014and the truth of it, for that matter\u2014that had me in tears for the last thirty pages this morning. Card shows redemption working in the most unexpected characters, of which Peter is only the most central, and his latter scenes allow for the existence and goodness of a God who has, as in Psalm 18, 'made darkness his hiding place.' It was those things, even more than the sorrow, that put my eyeliner to the test. (Both eyeliner and mascara survived the meltdown. I'm impressed.) Card sold me on the ending, but I can imagine some readers being a touch less satisfied. A handful of threads are left unresolved for sequels' sake, and the heartache and sweetness are pretty inextricable. I'll recommend the entire Shadow series wholeheartedly to anyone who has read much of the Ender saga and loved it. For anyone who has not read the Ender saga: if I taught writing, Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead would be required reading for an understanding of how to write humanity; but even for those only looking for some good reading, I recommend those two books almost without reserve. They are some of the best modern fiction I've ever come across. ...more Eh. It was ok. Not his crown masterpiece. Lots of war games, strategy.

[SPOILERS FOLLOW] He left it wide open for a new series about an Achilles re-mix, the genetic offspring of Bean, with Beans brilliant-but-fatal condition, but raised by a woman who thinks Achilles is a poor misunderstood brilliant leader. She doesn't know it's Bean's kid or that it has that condition, and she's teaching him the \"real truth about Achilles\". She takes him off to a colony world, which means he'll be time-delayed just like Bean's other wonder-kids which he takes into space with him. Which means someone might care enough to try to figure out Bean's problem if they have to deal with another Bean-but-evil. However, Bean is not ambitious, so would Bean's kid be? Hmm. Bean's kid would also not have Bean's military training. And raised by a crazy lady on a colony world. Hmm. But either way, the next series will surely be about all the little Beans running around being crazy-brilliant and trying to out-maneuver each other, using the colony worlds as their playground. Perhaps using space travel as a way to delay the effects of their disease. The other interesting part of the book was this idea that Volescu was planning to release a genetic virus that would make every new kid have Bean's disease. So it would change the course of human evolution and create a new species of super-humans, who would die at age 20. But that was dropped, it wasn't the case, he was just bluffing. But that would be an interesting book. Question: Why don't they set up a lab in Bean's ship that he goes off in with his uber-smart babies? Wouldn't they be the best ones to try to find a cure? They've got motivation and they are smarter than Valescu. Hmmm. ...more Adam C.

It made me feel as if Orson Scott Card was wandering helplessly in the desert of his own imagination and never finding an oasis of meaningful creativity. Happily, Shadow of the Giant, the 4th book in the Shadow series, is a solid return to the character-driven, emotional core that made Card\u2019s other Ender and Shadow books so good. The best part of Shadow of the Giant is that one of the main conflicts and with it the main antagonist\u2014Achilles\u2014is gone. Bean\u2019s personal war with Achilles was overwrought and its subsequent resolution was surprisingly weak. Now that it\u2019s over it feels as if Card doesn\u2019t have to slavishly return to the conflict as he repeatedly did in the last book. The meat of this book is the confrontations between a variety of characters and countries, which allows for more diverse and interesting scenarios. In other words, Shadow of the Giant is a whole lot more entertaining than Card\u2019s last entry in the series. Anyone familiar with any of the books in the Ender or Shadow series knows that they\u2019re based on psychology as well as science fiction. Card sometimes meanders into too much psychoanalysis of his characters, which he accomplishes through stilted dialogue, but the characters remain fascinating. As I have said before, I am invested in these characters and will continue reading what Card has to offer in this universe even after the Ender and Shadow series are over. By reading in their entirety the Ender and Shadow series in the Ender\u2019s Game universe, I can honestly and confidently say that there are two books which are must-reads\u2014Ender\u2019s Game and Ender\u2019s Shadow.

I feel like this book was just OSC showing off. It was as if he were attempting to write a book to show other authors how to develop characters.

I'm a little torn about having Ender in Exile to follow up this book as I feel like I don't need anything else from these characters...however, as I said above, I feel like I've seen all these kids grow up and thus, I want to know as much as I can about their lives.

The novel begins with a Chinese coup led by \u201cHot Soup,\u201d resulting in him being crowned Emperor. Three key jeesh members now lead countries in rather close proximity, and all have aspersions of growth. Throughout the novel, Graff, Rackham, and Peter all encourage Ender\u2019s army to abandon Earth and colonize other planets, pointing out the fact that if they do not, millions of soldiers will die in the scramble for supremacy. At the same time, Bean and Petra are searching for the embryos stolen by Achilles and implanted in wombs throughout the world. We get only two glimpses into the mind of the woman who birthed the only unfound child. And, while the world domination comes to an end, the saga of these nonhuman children is left open, which will surely lead to another novel. I\u2019ve found myself speculating just how far into the future space travel will make this confrontation; could it, perhaps, involve the great Ender himself? I am also interested in seeing what happens to Bean\u2019s \u201calien\u201d offspring. In short, as soon as the next novel comes out, Card has at least one buyer. The story is fast paced and detailed. I love the fact that the solution to the problem of the Buggers has led to another problem on Earth. In short, the Battle School children, bred for a hunger to lead and an ambition for power, return to their homes and destabilize the world. But I also love the fact that the intelligence and ability to reason ultimately leads them all to the same conclusion. Fast paced, powerful, and with a great story to tell, Shadow of the Giant keeps readers locked to its pages. The focus here is more on overall objectives and less on individual battles. Card has told yet another masterful tale. This story wraps up the life of the Hegemon, Peter Wiggin, and has humanized him. I have to wonder if it was the same story Ender might have written\u2026but Ender\u2019s tale was far shorter, as I recall. Either way, I look forward to learning what happens to Bean and his children, and whether young Achilles is ever found. ...more Hmmmmmmmmmmmm. Going to have to reiterate my wish that these four books had been combined, heavily pruned, and polished a little, I'm afraid... I concur with this review on most points... the endless geopolitical stuff got very tired early on in this book, and while it was good to see a little more on Alai and Virlomi (I really liked her story), the whole point of this set of things is Peter's rise, and the constant bogging-down of what could have been a really interesting, succinct examination Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.

Haven't said this before but I'm going to have to, at this point: the enjoyment I *did* get out of the book is undermined considerably by the constant harping on about family and babies and marriage and babies and the point of life for women (and men, but mostly women) being babies... jfc. Can't fault the \"active, intelligent and independent\" female characters, but to have them all (pretty much) decide that family life was their one-true-calling and everything else is subsidiary, and that somehow Petra is the bad guy for following her intelligence rather than her womb until the Very Last Minute is just... ugh. And puhleeze - all that \"Redeem the battle children with family life\" stuff... pretty much everything in this quartet loses a star for that. But this book in particular. Alienating, distasteful, and an unpleasant surprise after the robust females elsewhere in the Ender saga. ...more \u041e\u0442 \u0434\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0441\u044a\u043a \u0434\u043e

While the Shadow books follow Bean and the other Battle School Children back to Earth, the other books follow Ender on his journey through space. I left these books from my list intentionally. I started Speaker for the Dead and found it horribly boring, so I returned it to Amazon. The reviews I've read of the other books don't inspire me to pick them up at all. I read the books in this order, and I feel extremely satisfied with the result. Shadow of the Giant has put a perfect little bow around the events that happened on Earth after Ender and friends saved us all from the Buggers. Over the course of the Shadow series, I completely enjoyed bonding with so many great characters. At the beginning they are small children in Battle School, and by the end they are young adults who have done great things with thier lives. The only thing I love more than a great story are great characters, and Shadow series gave me both. I also enjoyed the political and military strategy discussed and analyzed throughout the series. I know, that sounds so boring--but the great thing is that it's not! There are long stretches where the characters talk to themselves, going over the different pieces that together make up the situation, and as the reader we follow their path of logic to its always satisfying conclusion. The politics of future Earth imagined in the series is one where actual current events might possibly lead to, and the fact that I could imagine it all happening just as described was part of the fun. Now that I've finished, I might go back and try again with Speaker of the Dead. There are people that love it, so maybe I put it down too soon. OSC has also, just this year, published another sequal to the Shadow series, Shadow's in Flight. I won't even mention the premise of that book--just by saying what it is about would spoil some elements of the existing books. But I will say that I have strong hesitations about reading it. I feel satisfied with the way the series has alread ended, and the reviews of Shadow's in Flight have not been kind. I've got a lot of book on my reading list, so I'll probably wait. Maybe one day I'll get the itch to revisit this great story and what else Orson Scott Card can dream up--while the story ended well, there could still be much, much more story to tell. To me, that's a testament to the depth of the characters in the stories. Goodbye Ender. Goodbye Bean. Goodbye Petra. Goodbye Peter. Thanks for such a meaningful experience. If you can't tell, I give Shadow of the Giant and the entire Ender Saga as I've outlined it above my full recomendation. ...more I think that, once again, Orson Scott Card has delivered an incredible book to continue the story that started with an undersized street urchin.

Bean is trying to help Ender's brother Peter unite the world under one government. The problem is that his rapidly growing body doesn't have much time before his heart is no longer to bear the strain of gravity on Earth; and there is still much work that needs to be done before this happens. I chose to read this book because I couldn't get enough of Bean. He has always been my favorite character, so I naturally loved his series. I wasted no time after reading Shadow Puppets to snag this up in read it quickly. This is my favorite series, so I was thrilled getting the chance to read every book in it. I liked this book so much because it is quick paced. Bean only has a certain amount of time, and things need to get done. It is also great to read about Peter's work trying to unite the world. Growing up I've always heard of people having ambition to rule the world, so it w as very interesting to read about someone who was actually trying to do something that has always just been a joke. The only disappointing thing is that Bean's giantism is catching up to him. He is my favorite character in any book, so it is hard to see him facing a death that isn't terribly heroic. My overall impression of the book is that is another great book in Bean's series. Orson Scott Card has done a very good job with this series, which means that all of the books have been solid; including this one. I think everyone who has read Ender's Game or Shadow, or is interested in this story should read it. I suggest this series to all who ask about it, because I thought it was amazing. This is a series that I will continue to read, and I think everyone else should at least give it a try. The only potentially offensive material in the book is that it is centered around a world at war. OSC doesn't go into great detail about the killing in the fights, but it is there. If that doesn't bother you then you should be fine. ...more \"You have to tame the horse before you can let it have its head.\" ~Mazor Rackham p. 50 \"'Who are you writing to?' 'Whom.

(view spoiler) [The entire Verlome deluding herself into believing she was divine and leading an army of untrained and ill equipped men into war was patently absurd. As too was her abrupt realization of her errors and subsequent shame. This was just Card being lazy and a little too clever for his own good. It allowed him to quickly and conveniently bring the Chinese/Russian/Muslim conflict to a close and teach a moral lesson to boot. No muss, no fuss. This along with the odd attitude of Petra after Bean\u2019s departure lost the fourth star for me and almost dropped this to a two star review. (hide spoiler) ] Overall, the strength of the pacing of the main storyline drew me along and made me want to see what happened next.

It was gripping enough that I finished it in just a few days. ...more This is the last book in the series, but there are enough loose ends left to continue the story.

Volescu is sent into space, where he is supposedly working on a \"cure\" for Anton's key. I wondered if he had anything to do with the virus entwined with the life cycle of the piggies on Lusitania. Creating a virus like that seems like the sort of thing he might do for fun. He doesn't actually WANT to find a cure for Anton's key, so I wonder what will happen to Bean. ...more Finally finished with all the Ender's Books. I made the mistake of reading Ender in Exile before reading Shadow of the Giant. Don't make that mistake. A good portion of Shadow of the Giant is summarized in Ender in Exile.

This is the second book i read that had me tearing up, Thank you Mr. Card for this story. I don't know if there are plans for a next book but i really hope there is, I want to know what happens to Bean.

So i decided to read Ender's Shadow since i found out it took place during Ender's Game, after reading it I came to like Bean more than Ender because he was just more intesting and he had a cruel destiny. I had to know what happend to Bean first so I read the Shadow Series, no... the Bean Quartet. After finishing this book I'm left thinking, I hope Bean's story/life ends well. Top marks for this book. ...more Wow. Card is the master at spinning a tale of political intrigue, inter-personal relations and conquering the world. He beautifully wrapped up the combined story of Bean, Petra, Peter, Suri, Alai, etc. and sent them each to their own destinies.

Again I say, OSC finally spoke their stories. And, most importantly, he finally gave us Peter the Hegemon. A Wiggin as worthy of admiration as Ender. A very satisfying end to this companion series. ...more Way too much battle and strategy talk and not enough action. There were whole chapters taken up by one long conversation. It's been a really long time since I read the previous books, but I think there was enough backstory to help me remember what happened.

I just can't bring myself to care about any of these characters. They were just there, teenagers leading armies, having babies, and running the world. It's easy to forget how young all these characters are, when you've distanced yourself a bit from Ender's Game (and Ender's Shadow). I think that's one aspect of the books you have to just not think too hard about. ...more Shadow of the Giant may seem a bit lackluster for the most part, but it's definitely a novel that improves when considered in retrospect. This is because, until you get to the ending, you won't be able to fully appreciate the full extent of Card's intricate plotting and richly textured thematic development. The power of the last few chapters really sneaks up on you, and I particularly enjoyed the book's bittersweet denouement. El desarrollo se vuelve pesado y demasiado moralista, pero se beneficia de un buen comienzo y un buen final. Para los fans del universo de Ender, vale la pena leerlo.

And somehow, I got off track Fourth in the Shadow sci-fi series and ninth in the overall Ender's Saga science fiction series and focuses on Bean and Petra and their desperate need to find all their children. It's actual sequel is Shadows in Flight (Shadow, 5; Ender's Saga, 12). My Take It's been so long since I read the start of this series and Shadow of the Giant has spurred me on to begin again. I remember when the first novel, Ender's Game , first came out. Fascinating. Too, too fascinating. And somehow, I got off track. I would seriously recommend reading from the start before beginning this story. I felt off-balance throughout the story since so much of the crucial moments leading up to this were made known earlier. I suspect that, perhaps, part of my confusion?, frustration?, was due to Card's writing style. I do not remember why Petra is so antagonistic?! I'm glad that Card kept reminding us that Bean is only 16 with his nine children. He has such an adult manner in the story. Reasonable, since Bean was a child when he helped Ender end the war. Dang, this story will just make you want to cry! A wishful \"mandate of heaven\" (to borrow from Han Tzu) in which Peter's plan is to persuade every country in the world to join his idea of a united world. We watch its progress through the actions of each of the Jeesh as they maneuver with control over their native countries. Randi is going to get a nasty surprise one day when she learns the truth about little Achilles Flandres, Jr. Card has an interesting assessment of Peter and what it takes to be Hegemon. Sadly, I suspect it's very accurate. And I doubt his like comes often. Petra cracks me up with her address to Bean that starts with \"O Father of the Balloon I'm Carrying Around Inside My Abdomen\". Rackham made a comment when he made the offer to the Jeesh that made me laugh at first, and then made me cry: \"If you hadn't spent your entire childhood playing war games, you'd actually know something. You're all so uneducated\". I like Peter's comments about America and how it's shaping his own Constitution for the FPE as well...gives me some hope! Oh, brother, the divorces in this story...one is good and the other...I just keep crying. Oh, I know Bean was right to do it as he did, but, still\u2026 The remarriage is not one that I expected. At all. Then there's Peter's last request of Ender. A nice little wrap-up of this story. The Story It begins with an intimate perspective on the troubles that are facing the members of Ender's Jeesh when Han Tzu receives an offer and the backup in case he rejects that offer. We visit each Battle School graduate alternating with Bean and Petra's search for their in vitro children. It's a natural inclination to want your children around you and not scattered to the winds. But Bean's illness has made the search even more imperative. Graff and Rackham have made Bean an offer that may save the lives of those children who have inherited Bean's problem and Bean's approaching death makes it even more necessary to find the affected ones NOW. Alai is brought to realize the extent of his power and his actions to change this only lead to reality even as he brings down those who oppose him, but it's Alai's marriage that is the death knell. And still, Bean, is giving his all to help Peter in his project. His plan to unite the earth, the Free People of the Earth (FPE) while a new pair of essayists are at work swaying world opinion: Lincoln and Martel. The Characters Peter Wiggins , Ender's older brother, is the Hegemon while Ender and Valentine have been exiled. Theresa Wiggins is his mother and revolving around Peter, missing Ender. Members of Ender's Jeesh are all here: Han Tzu (Hot Soup) is almost persona non grata in China; Julian Delphiki (Bean) ; Petra Arkanian Delphiki is pregnant; Alai is now Caliph of the Muslims, but experiencing all the issues of member Muslim countries; Suriyawong is back in Thailand coping with defeat and occupation; Vlad is useless in Russia; Carn Carby is in Australia; Dink Meeker and Crazy Tom in England; Shen in Tokyo; Fly Molo in Manila; and, Dumper in South America. While not a member of the Jeesh, Virlomi is now the acting goddess of India and using publicity beautifully to cause her fellowmen to rise up against the invading Muslims. Felix Starman is the prime minister of Rwanda. Anton has come back out of retirement to help Bean. Mazer Rackham , a hero several times over, is back with International Fleet (I.F.) and manipulating politics. Again. With Colonel Hyrum Graff . These two are master manipulators and you won't see how very cleverly until the end. Snow Tiger is the leader currently ruling in China. Ivan Lankowski is Alai's friend in Damascus. Volescu is Bean's half-uncle and a bit of a mad scientist with no ethics who infected and disseminated the children. Ferreira is trying to track down everything Volescu did. The children affected with Anton's Key are Ender , Carlotta , and Cincinnatus ; the normal children are Andrew , Bella , Ram\u00f3n , Julian , and Petra . The Cover The cover is prophetic with Bean and Petra standing within a circle of buildings looking out at the starscape where he's about to be exiled. I suspect the title is about how Bean used his brilliant mind to aid Ender in his aims within Ender's shadow, the shadow that Bean casts over all that he has accomplished on our world, the Shadow of the Giant . ...more I've enjoyed Bean's story, even more than Ender's, but there are a couple of things that have been nagging me throughout this entire series. Bean is supposed to be the most intelligent human being alive. I can't help but feel that Card can't even come close to properly portraying the smartest man alive. First of all, it's ridiculous that Bean should spend any brainpower at all thinking about religion and God. Countless studies show a clear inclination towards atheism in people with high IQs. This I've enjoyed Bean's story, even more than Ender's, but there are a couple of things that have been nagging me throughout this entire series. Bean is supposed to be the most intelligent human being alive. I can't help but feel that Card can't even come close to properly portraying the smartest man alive. First of all, it's ridiculous that Bean should spend any brainpower at all thinking about religion and God. Countless studies show a clear inclination towards atheism in people with high IQs. This is purely an artifact of the religious beliefs of the author, and I suppose I can understand why he would like to believe that a super-intelligent person would end up clearly admitting belief in some sort of God. I mean, if the smartest of us is willing to have faith, shouldn't the rest of us take a hint? Unfortunately, Card missed the memo: the smartest of us have already had their say, and the overwhelming majority of smart people have come to the conclusion that religious belief/purposeful ignorance is foolish and a waste of time. And I really don't care that he was raised by a nun. He's too intelligent for that and the sappy ending that his \"hidden faith\" allows for just makes him seem weak and pathetic. Secondly, the reason Bean is the biggest brainiac of all is actually because his brain is supposedly still growing, still forming new neural pathways. Why is it, then, that he's only really good at military strategy? Why is it that he has so much trouble empathizing with and understanding the people around him? Empathy and intra-personal skills are just pathways in the brain as well, and he is able to practice nearly every waking moment! Bean should have grown into a genius in every right, not just in one area like a kid with Asperger's. You can tell when Card is having trouble writing about someone smarter than him; most of the time, Bean's \"genius\" only shows in some random intuitive leap or other. At least he was actually devising new, never-before-thought-of techniques back in the Battle Room. Now he's just an overgrown bag of hormones and awkwardness and grey matter. Literally. For what it's worth, after all that, the rest of the book was entertaining. The semi-normal Battle School Brats kept things moving. And I would definitely like to see how Bean's last child gets resolved if any more books are written in the Ender Universe. ...more *4.5 I'm quite impressed and delighted to see the development in Peter.
