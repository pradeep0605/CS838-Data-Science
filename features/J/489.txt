So is anyone Team A? A lot of people are Team W, and I admit, that does seem the likelier of the two. IT CAME OUT TODAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh, please, please, please, please, PLEASE let me read this soon!!!!!! D: D: D: I'M READING IT I'M READING IT I'M READING IT I'M ACTUALLY READING IT!!!! *UPDATE: READ* So....it's been about a month since I've read the book.<---F> Terrible</---F>. And I have yet to write a review! (A real review, I mean, not like the gibberish up there. *cringes*) Well, I WAS in Seattle with limited internet connection. And there would have been no time to sit down and write a review. So I guess that's my excuse. But I'm back and I don't have an excuse now! So here goes. This was the last book of the trilogy, and also the shortest one. I was moaning over that to other people (mainly my unsympathetic parents) as I read it. Still, it was reaaallly good. It was also probably the darkest of the Kane Chronicles, perhaps even darker than the Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus books, as it mentioned lots of deaths (most of them very minor characters) and even some torture, which wasn't graphic in any way--it wasn't narrated, just mentioned--but which served to give a darker feeling overall. I've mentioned before somewhere that I never give <---A>Rick Riordan</---A> books any less than five stars, (unless they're really and truly awful, and I haven't come across any like that yet) even if they're more of a four stars. I'd give this a 4.5. I liked how certain characters--mostly Walt--were made more 3D. (Does that make any sense?) In The Throne of Fire, the book before this, one of the reasons I hated the possibility of Sadie and Walt together was because Walt seemed so...not real. Predictable. Boring. But Uncle Rick apparently worked on making him more believable, because I was able to sympathize a lot more with him. The plot seemed to be mostly the same as other books--you know, the enemy threatens Carter and Sadie, they try and find a way to destroy him, which takes most of the book, and then there is a fight at the end that temporarily destroys--or wipes out--the enemy. All of this was the same, except for the battle at the end. There was so much focus on other things that happened in the book (quite a bit of it was love triangle drama) that when the battle to get rid of the enemy finally rolled around, and they defeated the serpent (what? You knew they would!), I felt kind of...cheated. I thought, \"Really? It just happened? Wait, wasn't there something more?\" Because the two books before had a lot more tension and drama (drama relating to the battle, I mean) leading up to the climax, it just seemed a lot less impressive. The end of the book made it so obvious that Rick is leaving the door open for a follow-up series, like he did with Percy Jackson. In fact, it was even more obvious in this book than in the last Percy Jackson book. <+++>The Serpent's Shadow</+++> ends on pretty much the same notes as The Red Pyramid, now that I think about it, except with a less obvious threat. The love triangle. Aargh. How I hate those. If only Riordan didn't put it in. (But that'd erase, like, fifty pages of the book.) But, oh well, he did. And I must say, I wasn't entirely satisfied with the way it concluded. It seemed so predictable. I won't say any more, because I know if I was reading this, I would be freaking out. \"Oh NO! Does that mean that ___ gets Sadie??!\" (Sadie would probably hate that way of telling it, but really, what other ways are there to describe it?) (Actually, there are several, but that's the one I'm going to use. Sorry, Sadie.) So, no more. But it really wasn't an awful way of dealing with it, just a bit...weird. And predictable. (ZIP IT, ME!) Minor spoiler ahead--a sort of easter egg not important to the plot in any way, but I liked discovering it for myself. (view spoiler) [ *SPOILER AHEAD!* There was this really funny part in the book where Sadie is at a school dance (I know--\"school dance?!\" It's not as bad as it sounds, really) and she runs into an enemy of hers, a classmate at school, named Drew. This Drew is a total fashion diva/mean girl pretending to be nice girl/makeup-obsessed...person. She's the sort of girl that calls you \"hon\" and \"sweetie\" after lots of not-so-subtle insults pretending to be disguised as compliments are hurled your way. She also has long curls and pink eyeliner. Does any of that sound familiar? If you've read The Lost Hero, it should be! This Drew is the exact same Drew that Piper McLean from TLH disagreed with at Camp Half-Blood. (She doesn't seem to have changed much. Or at all.) Sadie also finds a friend of hers from the same school named Lacey, with blonde pigtails and braces. The same Lacey from the Aphrodite cabin! I was about halfway through the scene, wondering, \"is this the same Drew? Is it?\" when Lacey mentioned some disagreement with Drew at a summer camp, and I knew it had to be the same ones. Hilarious. Oh, wait, and did I mention Anubis shows up at the dance? I nearly died laughing. Again. *SPOILER OVER* (hide spoiler) ] Winding down, finally, this was, on the whole, a very good conclusion. Especially with the almost-promise of another series! It wasn't everything I hoped for, but it was pretty darn close. Oh my gosh, this review is insanely long. ...more can't believe this is the last ! *puts an Imperius curse on Riordan* * Imperio! don't end the Kane Chronicles series! * --> hahaha =) well that sounded really lame . Ok, now I have to wait for this too!?! Still waiting till the The Son of Neptune comes out! Well, not that too many months away I guess. I wonder if there will be anymore hints about the Manhattan side of the river..... My brother thinks it would be pretty cool if the Kanes met Percy.... WOW!!!! Just saw the COVER!!!! BEST. ONE. YET. CANNOT WAIT!!!!! AWESOMEAWESOMEAWESOME!!!!! Rick Riordan has done it again. Really wraps up this trilgoy...with hints to a possible follow-up. As much as this pained me\u2014which was a a lot , since I\u2019m a big fan of Rick Riordan\u2014I rated <+++>The Serpent's Shadow</+++> with a very HIGH 3.5 stars. :( Why? What went wrong? Allow me to start off with an obvious fact about my regards to The Kane Chronicles in general: Like many other people, I preferred the Percy Jackson and the Olympians over The Kane Chronicles . With that said, I also have to admit I consist of more knowledge on Greek mythology than Egyptian mythology. However, I loved studying both types As much as this pained me\u2014which was a a lot , since I\u2019m a big fan of Rick Riordan\u2014I rated The Serpent's Shadow with a very HIGH 3.5 stars. :( Why? What went wrong? Allow me to start off with an obvious fact about my regards to The Kane Chronicles in general: Like many other people, I preferred the Percy Jackson and the Olympians over The Kane Chronicles . With that said, I also have to admit I consist of more knowledge on Greek mythology than Egyptian mythology. However, I loved studying both types before reading both series, and if I do say so myself, I was (and still am) a bit of an expert in both categories. Here\u2019s the thing: I knew Egyptian mythology was much more complex than Greek mythology\u2014and that\u2019s why I applauded Rick on the success of creating The Red Pyramid , the first book in The Kane Chronicles , to be a refreshing and informative, fun read. I got the Percy Jackson thrill after reading The Red Pyramid : happy, in suspense, and wanting more. Yes, I still adored dear ol\u2019 Percy over Carter and Sadie\u2014but their story and the magic of the Ancient Egyptian magicians (oh, lookie! A rhyme!) intrigued me so much that I couldn\u2019t wait for the second book! The dash of innocent romance also increased my interest for the book. So my bro got the second book, The Throne of Fire . And I instantly nagged him to allow me to borrow it from him when he was done. After he finished, and after reading five Wicked Lovely books later on my part, I rapidly read through the sequel, engrossed with it. However, when I finished and gasped for some air, I instantly noted that the second book seemed to be lacking when compared to the first book. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I enjoyed the sequel. I couldn\u2019t deny I thought the first book was better though, and that the sequel dragged on at some points. What I think really put me off was the love triangle Rick inserted into the second book for Anubis, Sadie, and Walt. I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised: Rick Riordan loves his love triangles! I also honestly don\u2019t mind love triangles\u2014as long as they\u2019re sensible and NOT irritating. Yes, I fell for Anubis in the first book. And even in the second book, I cheered for him to end up with Sadie. BUT, I couldn\u2019t help feeling that one of the reasons I actually liked Anubis a lot more than Walt was because I felt he was more developed and complex. I didn\u2019t exactly mind the pitying background story Walt had to make him more likeable (I am Team Jem from The Infernal Devices , who is in a similar situation; and choosing him over Will is saying something since I love both equally), but Walt just fell\u2026 flat to me. No, I didn\u2019t want him to die... But I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to swoon at the thought of him. Besides, I thought the forbidden love between Anubis and Sadie would\u2019ve been enough to cause a hassle in The Red Pyramid and throughout the trilogy\u2014why would you want to add a love triangle at all? This is where my thoughts on the final book of The Kane Chronicles , The Serpent\u2019s Shadow , come in. My first thoughts when I finished reading the book? EW, and a bunch of incoherent rants and speeches running out of my mouth on how creeped out I was. I stayed up all night long basically starting and finishing the book. In no doubt, it was addicting with numerous humorous comments here and there. Also, the pure genius factors where Rick entwined Egyptian mythology with his story and new ideas to make a unique book was still there and working its magic. The format he also used to write the trilogy was creative; it had the two Kane siblings\u2014the main characters\u2014recording their adventures via voice recorder in their POVs. Rick even took the liberty of crossing over Drew and Lacy from The Lost Hero , which gave me joy and made me smile silly for the sheer heck of it! Yet, there were some problems in the book that I had to address. These negative comments I've typed up caused me great pain, and made my heart heavy with sadness. I\u2019m so sorry Rick Riordan! Problemo number 1: The Predictable Plot What made me love Rick Riordan\u2019s books so much was the way he threw a small, expected twist along the storyline, to only drop a HUGE bomb-of-a-twist right in our face that we never saw coming. An example of that bomb-of-a-twist in this series was in the first book\u2014Rick made us, the audience, believe that Set was the big bad guy the Kane siblings had to defeat to restore order in the world. And when they managed capturing Set, like most people believed they would, Rick drops the biggest bomb on who the real antagonist was, and how he beat the God of Evil by being the Lord of Chaos!!! I actually didn\u2019t see Apophis coming, and I admit I never even heard of him beforehand. So my interest was deepened further into the Kanes and their adventures. Yet, in this book\u2014the third book\u2014I found everything remotely predictable, and was rushing through the book not to see what happened , but to confirm what I suspected. The hints, I thought, were too obvious. While reading, I also felt like I was re-reading The Red Pyramid and The Throne of Fire . The events seemed to go through the same cycle as the previous books: the Kane siblings destroyed/bombed a museum, snatched some artifact from the museum, argued, focused on their love lives, then focused back on an important mission to save the world. They\u2019d then split up for mini-missions along the way, where they and their friends would rescue each other when in danger, join forces again, have more love problems, as well as a god/gods help them out or get in their way. Carter and Sadie would then bicker more before going back to thinking about their relationship problems. The final battle would arrive and the famous Kane siblings would miraculously manage to barely save the world. After that, a romantic moment sparks between the Kane sibling\u2019s love interests and them would spark up and Carter and Sadie would go to a gathering/party at the gods\u2019 joint to be praised/shouted at. Wash, rinse, and repeat. I totally had d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu reading the third book. Problemo number 2: The (Sorta) Lack of Suspense in the Final Battle Rick has a gift in writing memorable last battles\u2014he really does. BUT (I\u2019m using a plethora of BUT s today, huh?) the last battle where Apophis and the Kane siblings faced off? Not a total letdown, but not as finger-gripping-knuckles-going-white-heart-beating suspenseful as I\u2019d expected from Rick Riordan. I won\u2019t spoil anything, but the final battle wasn\u2019t exactly as epic as I thought it\u2019d be due to the lack of emotion and perhaps vague descriptions of what was going on in the battle (I\u2019m not saying Rick did more telling than showing\u2014I just didn\u2019t exactly feel moved or at the edge of my seat during the battle like I did in Percy Jackson\u2019s The Last Olympian \u2019s final battle). Problemo number 3: The Romance ***SPOILERS*** I knew that the romance was just something to add to the story\u2014it wasn\u2019t a major theme or anything. That was my point exactly. Carter and Zia\u2019s relationship was quite fine; I liked the little puppy-love and adorable, cute moments they had together in the second and third book. Yes, I felt Carter never really got to know Zia as well as her shabati (sad, but true), and I couldn\u2019t help feeling like it was a bit like insta-love when he finally did get to talk to her. Not totally something I anticipated would come from Rick Riordan, considering how long it took Percy and Annabeth to develop feelings for each other (which was one reason I adored the couple\u2014their relationship was realistic and they got to KNOW each other). Despite that, though, I really did enjoy Carter and Zia\u2019s dose of romance in the end (especially the \u201cCPR\u201d scene in The Throne of Fire :P). Now, the REAL thing that just didn\u2019t work well with me and totally gave me mixed feelings\u2014which wasn\u2019t a compliment\u2014was the Anubis/Sadie/Walt love triangle. YES, I found out why there had to be a love triangle. YES, I saw the \u201csolution\u201d to the love triangle coming. YES, I was still shocked when I confirmed my suspicions were spot on. NO , I was NOT happy with the solution! This was only my opinion, so yours might\u2019ve differed. Nonetheless, I have to say I\u2019m disappointed how Rick solved this love triangle. The worst way, I thought, to allow the girl/guy to choose the \u201cright guy/girl\u201d was to kill off one of the guys/girls, and let the living guy/girl get the girl/guy by default. I knew Rick would NOT allow Walt to die . Yet, when I found out what I suspected what he'd do with Walt and Anubis, I realized there WAS really something worse than taking the easy road and killing off a point in the love triangle to end it\u2014the solution Rick proposed was the icing on the cake when it came to ending a love triangle in an easy way that made me feel cheated throughout the book! YES, it was clever. BUT, I did feel like it was a cheap way to end the triangle. It gave me the creeps, and I just felt like there could\u2019ve been a better solution to a couple of things that could\u2019ve led the decision in a different direction one way or the other (i.e. couldn\u2019t Walt come back to life by the shadow ritual being performed on him???). I know Rick\u2019s not the only author who has done this, but I can\u2019t help feeling THAT a majority of authors tend to rid himself/herself of his/her love triangles by making one point of the triangle unavailable in the last book, as opposed to making the main cause of the triangle CHOOSE who she/he truly loves without the other dude losing his/her patience with her/him. Here are two examples (these were actual scenarios in some books with love triangles, and how they were solved, SO READ IN CAUTION!!! ): ~One point couldn\u2019t date a boy she liked because she became an oracle, and thus can\u2019t date/marry anyone. ~One dies in a hospital during an invasion in an attempt to fix his shattered brain for the sake of his ungrateful girlfriend. (Almost cried at that point in the book.) Ugh. For once, I\u2019d like to SEE the girl/guy make a decision with a genuine reason why they loved this person over the other! Agh! ***END OF SPOILERS*** I know people may say I have no right to compare Percy Jackson to The Kane Chronicles , since they\u2019re both different books. That\u2019s true. However, Percy\u2019s adventures were written BEFORE the Kanes\u2019, and when I know that, I would only assume the author would know what his strong points are, what to work on, and how to improve the new series to surpass the old one. I loved the spin-off series, The Heroes of Olympus , much more than I did with the original five Percy books (which I was OBSESSED with!). And I do sometimes miss looking through the clueless eyes of Perseus Jackson, but in the new series, I can see how Rick Riordan grew in his writing and created new characters I adored that weren\u2019t Percy, Thalia, Nico, Annabeth, Clarisse, Silena\u2026 Apollo *sheepish smile*, etc. (I loved The Lost Hero trio; Jason, Piper, and Leo were awesome!) I dunno about the Kanes\u2019, but I just couldn\u2019t get around loving them over dear ol\u2019 Percy and friends. YES, I\u2019ll keep reading Rick Riordan\u2019s books \u2018cause I have faith in him and am a mega fan of his! YES, I\u2019ll read the Norse mythology series he\u2019s planning to write! MAYBE I\u2019ll read another Kane book if Rick decides to do a spin-off series\u2014but I won\u2019t be necessarily dying if I don\u2019t have it in my hands the day it comes out. ...more An amazing finale to a series I've come to love. Although I will miss Sadie and Carter so bad, I know they belong to characters I certainly will not forget. I wouldn't mind reading the series all over again to be reminded. :) AMAZING!!!!! as usual. Not as much split-your-side humor in this one, but the chapter titles are still hilarious and there are some awesome one-liners in here. Oh, and don't even forget the Sadie-Walt-Anubis triangle. Can you say PLOT TWIST? Definitely didn't see that coming, but I loved it. There are several twists that will make you devour the book, and it's totally worth it.5 stars, no doubt. More like 2.5 stars. Good, but not great. I was underwhelmed by the ending and thus don't really have much to say. I will comment on the final relationship between Sadie, Walt, and Anubis. Sadie being torn between the two was a pretty big conflict since the last book, but her just taking BOTH felt like no resolution at all. Does it count as polyandry if Walt/Anubis are more like 1.5 people than 2 people? The one and only issue with the book is that we know from the very beginning that we win. It basically starts saying sorry, but at least we stopped doomsday. Even that, because of the tone of the books, really isn't that big of a deal. The series is fun and entertaining. It is chalked with brother sister relationship fun. And best of all they hint at the End that there are other gods out there that they might encounter. As in the series, they already hinted that this is the same exact world Percy The one and only issue with the book is that we know from the very beginning that we win.

As in the series, they already hinted that this is the same exact world Percy is a part of, (Book one had a comment about other Gods residing across the bridge in Manhattan, and Cater swearing he saw a flying horse near the Empire State building), it makes for what might happen in the future. One could only hope that the two (or is it now three with rome?) groups will unite for awesomeness to come. I have a feeling it will have to do with Aristotle, the first Greek Pharaoh. Somehow I hope that if they are in another series, that there unique perspective can remain. It is entertaining to have comments from the peanut gallery while the book moves on. I should add because I didn't catch this but Sophie and the rest of the Kids at Brooklyn house go to a private school were the popular clique seems to be kids from the Aphrodite cabin and Sophie also tries to set up carter with another girl from camp half blood. ...more I'm so glad he's making this a trilogy and he's not going to continue the series for ages and ages and never end it. If that was the case, you can kiss THE THRONE OF FIRE off my reading list. Soo, I'm really glad to say that this was the best book of the series :)). It really impressed me. I wasn't expecting at very much since the first two book weren't at that \"Rick level\". But this was veery good. And... like I said it before, Walt Stone is officially my favorite character :). After all, the book was a good read and the plot was really nice. I never expected (view spoiler) [Bes (hide spoiler) ] to come back!! Never! But it was cool. It was pretty predictable that Walt was going to \"be Soo, I'm really glad to say that this was the best book of the series :)). It really impressed me.

Of course the \"little love\" stories and dramas that took part through the book were great. I will never compare the Kane Chronicles with PJO because I can't. Those are FAR better. Anyway, that's what I think. Still 5 stars, just because of the Riordan magic :))) Happy New Year everyone! ...more

My Review: (view spoiler) [ (view spoiler) [ (view spoiler) [ Ok, I must admit, I only like this book. Not love or anything beyond like (which is unusual for the last two books of the Kane Chronicles trilogy totally made me a fan girl). This series made me interested in mythologies and discover Rick Riordan (who is my number one favorite author) and check out his other books and read one of the best book series in the world, the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series that totally live up in my expectations and gave every avid fan of Percabeth their satisfaction. But this\u2026 Oh Hades! Don\u2019t even get me started on the Walt/Sadie/Anubis love triangle! Anyway, I\u2019d like to reserve the criticisms for later. Let\u2019s focus first on the positive side, shall we? I enjoyed this book. I would have given it five stars if I didn\u2019t read what happened to Walt and Anubis. If you\u2019re in love with Zarter (Zia/Carter) you\u2019ll appreciate this book as much as I do (but sadly, I\u2019m more in love with Sanubis and again, I\u2019ll tell you later why I only gave this book three stars). There are some scenes that made me crack up like this: (view spoiler) [ \u201cThat\u2019s my boy!\u201d Set shouted. \u201cShut up, Father,\u201d Anubis said. (hide spoiler) ] Isn\u2019t Anubis adorable? If you didn\u2019t crack up on that one, well, you haven\u2019t read the whole situation why they said that. So, I don\u2019t blame you. Getting out of topic again eh? Back to the topic, there are so many unexpected things happening. It\u2019s not that bad for a last book (though the ending hinted something for some future books) it totally live up to my expectations (if you don\u2019t count the love triangle of Sadie). We met more and more Egyptian gods like Shu (ah, my favorite Egyptian god after Anubis) and Hapi. Where\u2019s Tefnut? She\u2019s my favorite Egyptian goddess and didn\u2019t even appear in any book in this trilogy! It also helps us to know more about the world of Egyptian mythology with the Land of Demons, sheut (aka shadows being part of our soul) and many more. In romance, Rick Riordan did a great job on Zarter. I couldn\u2019t help but to squeal whenever they have moments! Criticism part. My criticism is not about how the book is written, plot and/or other things but on the love triangle between Walt/Sadie/Anubis. I DISLIKE IT!!! Ever since I started reading The Red Pyramid, whenever Sadie and Anubis have moments, I always squeal, highlight them on the book and rereading it all over again and even adding some comments! I had (take note of the past tense) love Sanubis with all my life! Forbidden love always interest me and I had only read few forbidden loves that actually live up to my expectations like the true love between Ash and Meghan from the Iron Fey series. Now, that\u2019s what I call a very interesting forbidden love! They did everything so that they can be together and Ash even went to the End of the World to have a soul so that he\u2019ll be with Meghan forever! But this\u2026 Urgh! The Sanubis in this book is a TOTAL disappointment! Oh come on! Give me a break! I know that (view spoiler) [ Anubis made Walt as his host that made the dying boy\u2019s life expand and both end up with Sadie and that they\u2019re two inhabiting one body that are just in harmony thanks to their similarities and their feelings for Sadie and everything. (hide spoiler) ] Puh-lease! THIS IS NOT WHAT AN ADDICTED SANUBIS FAN LIKE ME EXPECT! Why can\u2019t the Egyptian gods just offer Sadie immortality and be a goddess to be with Anubis? After all Sadie deserved it! Why can Greek gods offer Percy immortality thanks to the heroic deeds (just like Sadie and Carter did) he did and Egyptians can\u2019t? Because they can\u2019t and Greeks can? Give me a break! I had supported Kane Chronicles since the first book was published. I waited for a year for the Throne of Fire and waited another one for the last book, hoping to find more Sanubis that\u2019ll satisfy my needs. But no! It is so obvious that Sadie and Walt ended up together! And it is totally heartbreaking for a Sanubis fan like me. Walt had his own advantages! It\u2019s his body, so when he kiss Sadie, it\u2019s his own pleasure not Anubis\u2019s! And Anubis? He\u2019s just there watching them even if he\u2019s in the same body. Poor boy! He doesn\u2019t deserve that! I am so glad the book didn\u2019t reach Philippines! I\u2019m so glad I just found this in the internet! I\u2019m so glad I spent my money I intend to buy for this book to my mom on Mother\u2019s Day. As a once Sanubis fan, I won\u2019t buy this book. And I thought Kane Chronicles is a great series! I don\u2019t like RR\u2019s new writing style in Romance, the protagonist ending up with his second love not the first. Anyway, that\u2019s where my rant about romance ends. If there\u2019s a new book in this series (which I slightly doubt but the ending totally says that there\u2019s a next one) I\u2019m not going to buy it unless I\u2019ll find it interesting (which I highly doubt). That\u2019s all. Though if RR will write a next book about a crossover between Kane Chronicles and Percy Jackson and the Olympians, I might buy it. Again, it hinted on the ending about Long Island and everything. Before I go, here\u2019s the last chapter of the book. Thought you might wanna know what I meant with the Sanubis/Salt and hinted stuff. (view spoiler) [ HE\u2019D CHANGED HIS LOOK AGAIN. His amulets were gone except for one- the shen that matched mine. He wore a black muscle shirt, black jeans, a black leather duster, and black combat boots-a sort of mix of Anubis\u2019s and Walt\u2019s styles, but it made him look like someone entirely different and new. Yet his eyes were quite familiar-warm, dark brown, and lovely. When he smiled, my heart fluttered as it always had. \u201cSo,\u201d I said, \u201cis this another goodbye? I\u2019ve had quite enough goodbyes today.\u201d \u201cActually,\u201d Walt said,\u201d It\u2019s more of a hello. My name\u2019s Walt Stone, from Seattle. I\u2019d like to join the party.\u201d He held out his hand, still smiling slyly. He was repeating exactly what he\u2019d said the first time we met, when he arrived at Brooklyn House last spring. Instead of taking hand, I punched him in the chest. \u201cOw,\u201d he complained. But I doubt that I\u2019d hurt him. He had quite a solid chest. \u201cYou think you can just merge with a god and surprise me like that?\u201d I demanded. \u201c Oh by the way, I\u2019m actually two minds in one body . I don\u2019t appreciate being taken off guard.\u201d \u201cI did try to tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cSeveral times. Anubis did too. We kept getting interrupted. Mostly by you talking a lot.\u201d \u201c \u201cNo excuse.\u201d I folded my arms and scowled as best as I could. \u201cMy mum seems to think I should go easy on you because this is all very new to you. But I\u2019m still cross. It\u2019s confusing enough, you know, liking someone, without their morphing into a god whom I also like.\u201d \u201cSo you do like me.\u201d \u201cStop trying to distract me! Are you truly asking to stay here?\u201d Walt nodded. He was very close now. He smelled good, like vanilla candles. I tried to remember if that Walt\u2019s scent or Anubis\u2019s. Honestly, I couldn\u2019t recall. \u201cI\u2019ve still got a lot to learn,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to stick with charm-making anymore. I can do more intensive magic-the path of Anubis. No one\u2019s ever done that before.\u201d \u201cDiscovering new magical ways to annoy me?\u201d He tilted his head. \u201cI could do amazing tricks with mummy linen. For instance, if someone talks too much, I could summon a gag-\u201c \u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d He took my hand. I gave him a defiant scowl, but I didn\u2019t take back my hand. \u201cI\u2019m still Walt,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still mortal. Anubis can stay in this world as long as I\u2019m his host. I\u2019m hoping to live a good long life. Neither of us ever thought that was possible. SO I\u2019m not going anywhere, unless you want me to leave.\u201d My eyes probably answered for me: No, please. Not ever. But I couldn\u2019t very well give him the satisfaction of me saying that out loud, could I? Boys can get so full of themselves. \u201cWell,\u201d I grumbled,\u201d I suppose I could tolerate it.\u201d \u201cI owe you a dance.\u201d Walt put his other hand on my waist-a traditional pose, very old-fashions, as Anubis had done when we waltzed at the Brooklyn Academy. My Gran would\u2019ve approved. \u201cMay I?\u201d he asked. \u201cHere?\u201d I said. \u201cWon\u2019t your chaperone Shu interrupt?\u201d \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m mortal now. He\u2019ll let us dance, though I\u2019m sure he\u2019s keeping an eye on us to make sure we behave.\u201d \u201cTo make sure you behave,\u201d I snipped. \u201cI\u2019m a proper young lady.\u201d Walt laughed. I supposed it was funny. Proper wasn\u2019t the first word normally used to describe me. I pounded his chest again, though I\u2019ll admit not very hard. I put my hand on his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll have you remember,\u201d I warned,\u201d that my father if your employer in the Underworld. You\u2019d best mind your manners.\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Walt said. He leaned down and kissed me. All my anger melted into my shoes. We started to dance. There was no music, no ghostly dancers, no floating on air-nothing magic about it. Freak watched us curiously, no doubt wondering how this activity was going to produce turkeys to feed the griffin. The old tar roof creaked under our feet. I was still quite tired from our long battle, and I hadn\u2019t cleaned up properly. No doubt I looked horrid. I wanted to melt into Walt\u2019s arms, which is basically what I did. \u201cSo you\u2019ll let me stick around?\u201d he asked, his breath warm on my scalp. \u201cLet me experience a typical teenage life?\u201d \u201cI suppose.\u201d I looked up at him. It took no effort at all to slip my vision fort at all to slip my vision into the Duat and see Anubis there, just under the surface. But it really wasn\u2019t necessary. This was a new boy in front of me, and he was everything I liked. \u201cNot that I\u2019m an expert myself, but there is one rule I insist on.\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d \u201cIf anyone asks you if you\u2019re taken,\u201d I said,\u201d the answer if yes .\u201d \u201cI think I can live with that,\u201d he promised. \u201cGood,\u201d I said. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t want to see me be cross.\u201d \u201ctoo late.\u201d \u201cShut up and dance, Walt.\u201d We did-with the music of a psychotic griffin screaming behind us, and the sirens and horns of Brooklyn wailing below. It was quite romantic. So there you have it. We\u2019ve returned to Brooklyn House. The various catastrophes plaguing the world have lessened-at least somewhat-and we are dealing with an influx of new initiates as the school year gets properly under way. It should be obvious now why this may be our last recording. We\u2019re going to be so busy training and attending school and living our lives, I doubt we\u2019ll have time or reason to send out anymore audio pleas for help. We\u2019ll put this tape in a secure box and send it along to the chap who\u2019s been transcribing our adventures. Carter seems to think the postal service will do, but I think I\u2019ll give it to Khufu to carry through the Duat. What could possibly go wrong? As for us, don\u2019t think our lives will be all fun and games. Amos couldn\u2019t leave a mob of teens unsupervised, and as we don\u2019t have <---C>Bast</---C> anymore, Amos has sent a few adult magicians to Brooklyn House as teachers (read: chaperones). But we all know who\u2019s really in charge- me . Oh, yes, and perhaps Carter a little bit. We\u2019re not done with trouble, either. I\u2019m still worried about that murderous ghost Setne, who\u2019s on the loose in this world with his devious mind, horrible fashion sense, and the Book of Thoth. I\u2019m also puzzling over my mother\u2019s comments about rival magic and other gods. No idea what that means, but it doesn\u2019t sound good. (Skip the last part) (hide spoiler) ] (hide spoiler) ] (hide spoiler) ] (hide spoiler) ] ...more OH BOY. The third Kane Chronicles book! (And the last one too, I think ... AAAAH.) Pretty cover. It has a giant phallus in the background. I mean, the Washington Monument. The third (and hopefully not final) instalment in the series, The Serpent's Shadow brings to light the upcoming apocalypse. Except, it isn't upcoming. It's here. The showdown we've all been waiting for - Apophis vs Ra, The Way of the Gods vs the House of Life, Good vs Evil and Protein Bars vs Macho Nachos.

When the Book of Overcom The third (and hopefully not final) instalment in the series, The Serpent's Shadow brings to light the upcoming apocalypse. Except, it isn't upcoming. It's here. The showdown we've all been waiting for - Apophis vs Ra, The Way of the Gods vs the House of Life, Good vs Evil and Protein Bars vs Macho Nachos. But, as usual, nothing goes to plan. The Kanes face a dilemma. Apophis, using the power of Chaos, is slowly destroying the artefacts that could lead to his destruction. When the Book of Overcoming Apophis - their last hope - is snatched away before their eyes, Sadie and Carter have no choice but to follow Plan B. And if you know anything about Plan Bs, they are Plan Bs for a reason. Because they normally involve allying yourselves with evil magicians, talking to mentally unstable gods, debating over the 'hotness level' of guys, searching for lost sheut , hosting gods, fighting with gods, talking to your dead parents and trying to save the world from eternal Chaos and destruction. So obviously, they go with Plan B. But Ma'at isn't always on their side. The Kane siblings are forced to make heart-tearing decisions that could hold the lives of others in the balance, as well as having to work both together and apart. Can they resist the lure of Isis and Horus - and should they? Carter struggles with the weight of his new duties and expectations as well as his undeniable attraction to Zia Rashid, a girl whose role in the upcoming war is paramount and shrouded in mystery. As for Sadie...guy troubles aren't the only thing worrying our feisty heroine! Sure, Walt's days are numbered and the drop-dead gorgeous God of the Dead Anubis is as mind-boggling as ever (he still speaks in riddles), but a girl has bigger things to worry about. (I was very pleased with the amount of Anubis-ness in this book - yes, yes, I am getting as bad as Sadie but cut me some slack...the guy is cute as!:D) My favourite quotes: - \"(Carter) I resisted the urge to spike the pigeon. \"Yes. But Sadie found this shadow box. She thinks it's some sort of clue. You wouldn't know anything about using shadows against Apophis, would you?\" The pigeon (Horus) turned its head sideways. \"Not really. My understanding of magic is fairly straightforward. Hit enemies with a sword until they're dead. If they rise again, hit them again. Repeat if necessary.\" - \"Each time he (Ammit the Devourer) crashed, he shook his lion's mane and crocodile snout and yipped happily. Carter is scolding me, as always. He says Ammit is female. I'll admit I can't prove it either way, but I've always thought of Ammit as a boy monster. He's much too hyper to be otherwise and the way he marks his territory...but never mind. \"There's my baby!\" I cried, quite carried away. \"There's my Poochiekins!\" \"My lord Osiris!\" Disturber lost the bottom of his scroll again. \"This is an outrage!\" \"Sadie,\" Dad said firmly, \"please do not refer to the Devourer of Souls as Poochiekins.\" \"Sorry,\" I muttered and let Ammit down. - \"Sadie it's all right,\" Anubis said. \"Your friends are only unconscious. Shu just lowered the air pressure.\" \"Shoe?\" I demanded. \"Show who?\" Anubis pressed his fingers to his temples. \"Sadie...this is Shu, my great-grandfather.\" \"Ah. The god of...flip-flops. No, wait. Leaky balloons. No___\" \"Air!\" Shu hissed. \"God of the air!\" - \"In the Duat, Anubis look as he always had, with tousled dark hair and lovely brown eyes, but I (Sadie) had never seen him filled with such rage. I realised that anyone who dared to hurt me would suffer his full wrath.\" Brilliant book and I give three cheers for Rick Riordan - the guy who brought us the world of demigods, gods, more gods and pharaoh descendants!:D ...more Um well frigging amazing!!

Stories of Sadie with Anubis/Walt and Carter with Zia was good and understandable, even when (view spoiler) [ they turn out to be gods, or at least become gods. (hide spoiler) ] But still, the best relationship in the whole book was between Carter and Sadie. I like the bonds that shapes between brothers and sisters in tough times. When, for example, in the last book Sadie confronted that she will die for her brother's sake, if necessary. That bond developed in this book in a very beautiful way. I loved their feelings... + Alright, I have to say this, I understand Sadie. Walt WAS cute. So was Anubis, by the way. :D 3- I have no idea why, but Riordan seems to have an unconditional love for deadlines. \" The world shall end in two days if you don't do something. \". It's horrible. It repeats and repeats in every book. Seriously, WHY? 4- One of the most important reasons why I keep reading his books, is that the modern teenagers are modern teenagers. They talk about Hunger Games and behave like they are people in the 21st century. 5- Most important point is that Rick Riordan knows how to make a joke. He IS funny. I could give all the five stars to all the amazing jokes.

Having started off sluggishly, the (supposed) trilogy didn't exactly end with a bang, but there were quite some fireworks in there nonetheless. I say \"supposed\" because the very last paragraph in the book hints at a Heroes Of Olympus/Kane Chronicles crossover (I have a feeling we're going to run into Setne and the Book of Thoth pretty soon - say, September 2012?)! That should be interesting :) APOPHIS : the mighty red snake/ the Lord of Chaos/ the swallower of the Sun/ the architect of doomsday/ the initiator of the Apocalypse/ the writhing, fuming, hissing gargantuan reptile that makes dear ol\u2019 Nagini look like an earthworm that wriggled out on a rainy day....yep, ol\u2019Apophis has risen.

And the only people who have a fighting chance against him are the young brother-sister duo of Carter and Sadie Kane . The twosome are strong Egyptian magicians, who follow the paths of Horus and Isis respectively, have incredible powers at their disposal, are befuddled by their confusing love-lives and have the oh-so-simple onus of saving the world on their weary shoulders. Will the motor-mouthed Sadie and the super-grounded Carter provide us with a satisfying conclusion to all the Egyptian drama and chaos? Will they restore Ma\u2019at? Will they have their very own happy-endings? All this and much more in The Serpent\u2019s Shadow . -------------------------------------------------------------------------- The third ( and, apparently ) last instalment of The Kane Chronicles is a meaty read. Every chapter that begins with Riordan\u2019s trademark goofy titles, paves the way for non-stop action and yes, adventure. The Serpent\u2019s Shadow is a roller-coaster ride that begs, wags it\u2019s frisky tail and gets down on it\u2019s front paws and grovels to be made into a Summer Blockbuster. A little bit on our stalwart duo: CARTER KANE : Studious, practical, home-schooled and burdened by the constant pressure to live up to his illustrious father ( a famous Egyptologist who died and promptly became the host of Osiris . Over-achieving fathers, I tell you. ), Carter has matured into a hero with some pretty impressive combat skills at his disposal. Whether he will be able to guide the young initiatives at Brooklyn House, rally the doubting magicians together, plunge into danger with the hare-brained schemes of his fiercely independent sister, defang the primordial essence of Chaos...all while trying NOT to turn into a blithering idiot in front of Zia , is unravelled in full technicolour detail. SADIE KANE : I am in my 30s now. Which translates into the fact that I no longer imagine myself as a fierce, independent, smart-talking, butt kicking, YA heroine. Now I dream of being the fierce, independent, smart-talking, butt kicking mentor who guides aforementioned YA heroine. If I would channelize all things impressive and endearing into how a modern day young girl should be, she would have been a blend of Hermione Granger , Annabeth Chase , Luna Lovegood and now....Sadie Kane. As always, Sadie is a delight. She yammers away non-stop, casts powerful spells with a newly discovered aura of maturity, reverts back to a narcisstic teen in the throes of her love triangle and is as well-rounded as you would expect a \u00a0teenager to be. It would be extremely gratifying to launch into a dissecting character sketch on each and every member of the supporting cast. But the palette is so rich and varied that I couldn\u2019t let loose, without dumping a would-be reader with *SPOILERS GALORE*. As your progress with the book; feel all warm and fuzzy with old favourites like Bes , Bast , Tawaret , Khufu , Ammit , Osiris , Amos , Thoth , Anubis and Walt . Roll your eyes with suppressed exasperation over Horus , Isis and toothless Ra . Feel a tad itchy and uncomfortable over the conniving Apophis and best of all, watch every word/step/move with the new villain, Setne . The scenery is engaging. Whether it\u2019s the antics at Brooklyn House or the battle for survival on the dry-throated plains of Cairo or the ever-baffling complexities of the Duat .... Rick Riordan infuses each ambience with the right emotions. Speaking of the good man, Riordan...as always, he delivers. He continues his non-yawn inducing insights into mythology, has a writing style that knocks the Gods off their pedestals without ever plunging into blasphemy and solidifies his innate ability to infuse death-defying situations with that essential element of humour. Several broad hints are dropped about a possible sequel that will merge the world of Percy Jackson with that of the Kane siblings. Would I like to read it? I am unsure. On one hand, I know that Rick Riordan will never disappoint. His writing style appeals to me. On the other hand, do I want too many layers added to two splendid individual tales that worked just fine in their own separate niches? I really can\u2019t say. But as for now, The Serpent\u2019s Shadow awaits all of you who want to lose yourselves in a little bit of whimsy, a whole lot of magic, gallons of action and the impending threat of * Big-Red-Snake gobble Toothless-God-in-Loincloth *. Come away enchanted. ...more At this point, I wasn't surprised that I found the third book in the Kane Chronicles to be little more than passable. I still appreciate Riordan's take on Egyptian mythology and magic, and that both are very distinct from the way he treats Greek and Roman myths. He always has a knack for setting a scene, and he writes action really well. Those are the positives.

He always has a knack for setting a scene, and he writes action really well. Those are the positives. I still don't particularly care for either Carter or Sadie, which is a huge drawback in a series that entirely revolves around the two of them. At times, it seems like the entire world was designed to revolve around them, which may be part of why they seem so tiresome to me. They also seem immature, unfocused, and completely unable to put their personal and, frankly, silly romantic problems ahead of far more important things, like saving the world. I can't help but compare them to the Greek and Roman demigods, and they come up way short. The romances in this book come up short, too. Carter and Zia's romance is as boring as the two of them, and I found the \"resolution\" of the Walt/Sadie/Anubis love triangle to be creepy: (view spoiler) [Walt and Anubis merge, so Sadie can date both of them at once! (hide spoiler) ] It made matters far worse that I never understood what Anubis could have possibly seen in Sadie, or felt any chemistry whatsoever between her and either Walt or Anubis. I know that Riordan can do better than this. Percy and Annabeth's relationship is about as well-written as it gets: they love, respect, and compliment each other. It's a shame that Riordan couldn't bring any of that magic to the Kanes. And man, was this a predictable plot. I couldn't have been 100 pages in before I knew exactly where this book was going. Absolutely no suspense. This could have been much more exciting with a few more twists and turns, but there just weren't enough. Sure, the action sequences were well-written and injected some excitement into the book. Sure, there are some great characters in the supporting cast. And sure, nothing in this book (except Walt/Sadie/Anubis, ugh) is actively bad. But I know Riordan can do much, much better than this. ...more Just read this with the kids. I still love Carter & Sadie, the plot was well done, interesting and fun, writing funny, etc. Sometimes it had me in stitches (and I loved hearing my 10yo giggle her head off reading it). Riordan creates the funniest chapter headings since I don't know who. However, I still DON'T love the very early teen romance.

Riordan seemed to do better with Carter & Zia in this one, it was light and puppy-ish and more about friendship. Sadie and her two lovers were a different story. Gag. She's WAY too young, period. Not that kids don't \"fall in love\" but the whole dialogue was too mature and sophisticated for a barely 13 yo. It was just annoying, but I guess it'll be a good conversation with the kids. All in all a fun, clean, enjoyable read, which is what I'm going for right now. Riordan readers in our family can't wait to see how he ties all three of these series together. ...more What an awesome ending to the series. By now Rick Riordan has a certain formula for these books which is quite noticeable, but I have to say this one's his best so far. And is it just me, or has The Kane Chronicles really grown up since the first book? The kiddie humor's still here, I was actually laughing more than usual, but there's a not really mature but older feel to this book that I really didn't get from the previous installments. Excellent all around. Like in every single damn book since What an awesome ending to the series.

Excellent all around. Like in every single damn book since the first Percy Jackson , of course we open with some attention grabbing over the top statement. But this time, grunting farting camels! Hehe, despite the seriousness of the entire situation, what with Apophis on the loose and out to destroy the world and all that, I'm glad we can still expect f-ing grunting farting camels. And I could go on, there are so many fun cameos by various Egyptian gods, it's practically a Riordan trademark. Thoth throwing curse hieroglyphs and giving some demon intestinal problems, going green and toppling over. Neith just being insane, obsessed with survival, weaving, and macrame. Bad investment banker jokes, donations to the Red Cross baby! Explaining away the horribly jumbled Egyptian mythology with a retirement home for geriatric old gods, who come out and beat on a demon army with their canes and walkers! And the nurse's a giant hippo with a flaming torch and hypodermic needle, injecting bad guys in the butt! And of course, if somebody offers you Hapi pills, just say 'No!' So many bizarre quirks. Absolutely hilarious. But more than just the humor, I really had fun with the characters. I've always liked Carter and Sadie switching off the narration more than Percy just telling it as it is, even if they do sort of sound the same, which they do, but they're siblings, so it is sort of excusable. I'm sure I'm not the only one who went WTF, Sadie is boy crazy, and her problems, Walt dying, Anubis being off limits, it all reads like a Cassandra Clare book! I know it's probably unintentional on Riordan's part, but really, I loved how Sadie's problems became this sort of unintentional parody of The Infernal Devices . Too funny. If Clockwork Princess resolves that triangle like how this book resolves the whole Sadie/Walt/Anubis dilemma, I will be rolling on the floor laughing for days. And of course Carter sort of balances the growing up with the kiddie humor, his character, not showing enough initiative, and him and Zia were probably the weak links in the book, but no matter, still thoroughly entertained by the entirely satisfying plot. Hopefully, now that Apophis is beaten back (of course he is), those hints about a crossover with Heroes of Olympus are going to happen. So, I thought the first book, The Red Pyramid was better than any of the Percy Jackson books, couldn't really get into The Throne of Fire , but The Serpent's Shadow absolutely blew me away. I have to say this one's the best of the series, it's ridiculously funny, the humor really worked for me here, they can be kind of hit or miss, not all Riordan books are funny to me, but this one was just firing on all cylinders, and certainly unintentional but Sadie's drama just got me the right way. Absolutely amazing. ...more A Quest to Save the World...or End It \u201cThe glowing lights extended the boat\u2019s gangplank, and we climbed aboard for what might be the last sunrise in history.\u201d(Riordan) Sadie Kane was just a regular teenager, living in London with her grandparents.

Every year she would go with her brother, Carter Kane, and her father to various museums around the world. But in the blink of an eye, things become impossibly different. Now, Sadie and Carter Kane have a task to complete. A task that, if they failed, would cost them their loved ones, and the world. People have always feared snakes, and it doesn\u2019t make it better when there\u2019s a certain snake whose one primary goal is to destroy and bring chaos to the world. This enemy is exactly what Carter and Sadie Kane are up against, along with a couple of the most dangerous magicians that ever lived here and there, and the only known way to destroy the snake is expensive. Not in money, but in sacrifice. With the help of friends and family, these two heroes go through incredible transformations and discover that what you see, is not always the truth. The book The Serpent\u2019s Shadow by Rick Riordan is an breathtaking adventure in which two ordinary people are transformed into saviors of the world. If you like to read books on mythology, or just want to read a suspenseful, humorous, then this book would fit you. Every one of this book\u2019s pages is filled to the brim with bits and pieces of Egyptian mythology. If you also enjoy adventures from the characters\u2019 point of view, then you will most likely enjoy this book as well, as it offers the viewpoints of not one but two main characters. What I found particularly enjoyable about this book is the fact that you can clearly see, like a person gazing through a window, at just how much and how fast Sadie and Carter Kane change from the origin of the book to the conclusion. At the beginning of the book Carter and Sadie Kane were strong and good at magic, but in the end, Carter and Sadie Kane gain more than just power, strength, and honor, they gain friends, leadership, and confidence. This book also includes a section in the back with Egyptian terms and their meanings, a nice way to get introduced to a snippet of Egyptian mythology, language, and culture. Read this book for a fun, suspenseful, humorous, and enjoyable Egyptian journey. ...more This review has also been cross-posted on my Happy Indulgence Blog , check it out for more reviews!

Carter and Sadie Kane are descendents of the House of Life, an Egyptian temple of magic. In The Red Pyramid and The Throne of Fire, the Kanes learnt to command their unique abilities and revived the sun god Ra, a worthy opponent to the god of chaos, Apophis. In the third and final installment of this electrifying trilogy, Apophis is hell bent on bringing forth the end of days, and the Kanes have a limited amount of time to defeat the god of Chaos himself and save mankind. Following on from the Percy Jackson phenomenon about Greek gods and their offspring, the Kane Chronicles breathes life into the Egyptian gods and goddesses. From an off-kilter exuberant hippopotamus epitomising Hapi, the god of the Nile and an incredibly feline and agile female depicting Bast, the cat goddess, Riordan\u2019s creativity shines as he interprets the quirks of these ancient beings. The Serpent\u2019s Shadow picks up where The Throne of Fire left off, as Carter and Sadie discover an ancient spell that may defeat Apophis. With magical abilities and an academy of magical students, these siblings have the weight of the world on their shoulders. Told through interchanging perspectives, we learn about Sadie\u2019s inner turmoil between two boys, and Carter\u2019s insecurities about his role as a leader. It\u2019s the creativity and immensely imaginative world that Riordan has created that\u2019s the focus here, and you\u2019ll be constantly entertained with The Serpent\u2019s Shadow. Whether we\u2019re stumbling upon the next Egyptian god, hearing from Sadie\u2019s ghostly mother, visiting the underworld or seeing Carter turning into a falcon, The Serpent\u2019s Shadow is full of surprises. You\u2019d definitely need to read the first two books of the Kane Chronicles before delving into this one, as it\u2019s full steam ahead from the first chapter. If you\u2019ve read the Percy Jackson series and you\u2019re hankering for more, or you simply love Egypt, this series will not disappoint and you\u2019ll be wondering why it\u2019s just a trilogy.

The microscopic downside (because the book was still mind-blowing despite this) of this book was that it seemed very similar to the Percy Jackson series (which, if you haven't guessed, I'm also a fan of) in that they both revolve around the same concepts just different characters. (Boy has super powers, boy must accept the role of a hero, boy must defeat the bad guy or face an apocalypse, (view spoiler) [boy wins what initially seemed to be a losing war, gets the girl of his dreams, and restores order among the gods (hide spoiler) ] yada yada.) In fact, Kane Chronicles was similar in so many ways to Percy Jackson and the Olympians, at times stuff that should have left me surprised, didn't. In this weird way, it was all very deja vu. But the characters were different, the format was very, very creative - audio recording transcripts complete with alternating POVs - and really, really funny. I'll give you this Rick Riordan, your sense of humor is a force to be reckoned with. So yeah, this book was and is - yes, I'll say it again - awesome! Loved it, loved it, loved it! :D Well, I'll stop here. As much as I'd like to tell you all about this series, I don't think I'd actually be able to write a coherent review on this one (Two words: Smiley. Overload.) so I'll just say this: READ IT NOW, OR FACE THE WRATH OF ANY ONE OF THE EGYPTIAN GODS THAT WERE MENTIONED IN THE BOOK, SINCE NEARLY ALL OF THEM ARE TOTALLY BADASS. No, seriously. Read it.

I will admit that when it comes to children's fiction I love Rick Riordan's work. It's entertaining, features ideas and elements I love in fantasy and generally does what strong children's fiction should - be applicable for adults to read. The narration in his Egyptian series hasn't interested me so much as other series I will admit. Where Percy Jackson hit a balance between appealing to a juvenile and older crowd, I've always felt that his Egyptian series pushed a little more toward the child crowd or even to the dreaded new YA fiction 'genre'. That all said and done, I will always be amused by the combination of humour and energy Riordan brings to these series. It's hard not to imagine him being a great teacher simply from the exuberant nature of his work. As for plot? Well, like some of the graphic novels and other fantasy or science fiction works I've read I find it hard to discuss the plot. Simply suffice that it involves some quests, romantic resolutions and plenty of twists with Riordan working the suspense angles as hard as he can. If you've read the previous novels you will want to read on and finish it, because this is pretty decent if not full of 'wow - mindblown' moments. It's clean, friendly, good old fashioned fun. And in an era where fantasy is dominated by the dark side it's refreshing to go and read these fun tales. Which are also educative. I've never been huge on Egyptain mythology so I learnt plenty about it from reading these novels. ...more In this third part of the Chronicles of the Kane, Rick Riordan gets deeper into the exciting world of the Egyptian mythology guided by the Kane brothers.
