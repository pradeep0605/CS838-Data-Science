Still, I gave this book a chance, as I'd been impressed with Kate Mosse's work as an interviewer on the BBC's Radio 4. I'm glad that I read it. This book focuses on the Cathars, a gnostic sect centered in the Pays d'Oc, (modern southwestern France). Several legends have been told about the Cathars, including that they practiced ancient mystical rituals and that they were the guardians of the Holy Grail. What is known is that the Cathars rivaled the established church in parts of Western Europe. In the 13th century, Catholic churchmen and French nobles led an invasion of the Pays d'Oc and a bloody suppression of the Cathars, whom they regarded as heretics. Mosse combines two stories: a historical fiction, set against the invasion of the Pays d'Oc; the other, a modern thriller set in the Languedoc region of France. In these parallel stories, bad people with suspect motives are searching for the treasures that embody the secret wisdom of the Cathars (symbolized by a labyrinth). In both stories, the protagonist is trying to figure out what these treasures can be, along with how to stop the villians, without getting killed in the process. The <+++>Labyrinth</+++> dealt with many of the same themes as The Da Vinci Code, but it was superior in so many ways. I'll mention four: 1)Mosse does a good job of maintaining a sense of suspense. I wasn't able to guess what was going to happen three chapters ahead. (I always thought the Da Vinci Code's protagonist was a bit thick.) 2)Mosse doesn't make careless, glaring factual historical errors. 3)I got the feeling that Mosse knew the locales in which she set her story. 4)She's a good writer, one who doesn't rely on cliches and cheap narrative tricks. All in all, a good read, one that has got me digging through my old Medieval history books. ...more Oh the inner turmoil. Did I enjoy Labyrinth by Kate Mosse or not?

More murders, maniacs, manoeuvring and mendacity than Murder on the Orient Express. ACTUAL ARCHAEOLOGY BRAIN Whoa. You let someone wander around on an excavation randomly digging holes wherever they like? That is NOT how it is done. Now they've found something and are tramping into a cave and moving finds and relics around without photographing or drawing them first? And they're not even an archaeologist? Ok, that's it my head just E-X-P-L-O-D-E-D , really it did, there's brain all over the place. Good job my brain exploded before the introduction of the fact that the Assistant dig director is also stealing antiquities. And obviously because there is archaeology and the grail involved then they all have PhD's. Let's face it, after Dr Robert Langdon of DaVinci Code fame, only giving these ladies a Masters degree would make you feel like they were not quite clever enough to be dealing with the subject matter. I've recently come to realise that this historical duality/ time slip story telling method is a lot more common than I thought. Ackroyd, Amis, Smith and Mosse all embrace and employ this technique and if you have an author who is equal to the task of producing two well written narratives with different tones and styles then it works well. Mosse achieves this and both stories are equally well written and engaging. Archaeology brain overrides weekend sofa surfing brain on this review though because this book sailed a little too close to the chick-lit equator for me and that is an invisible line that I sail across with great caution. Wilbur Smith ( River God: A Novel of Ancient Egypt ) and Agatha Christie ( Death on the Nile ) therefore remain Crown King and Queen of archaeology fiction for me and I don't think they'll be abdicating or getting deposed any time soon. ...more I've read a lot of books on the Holy Grail in my time (some may say an obsessive amount, I prefer to think of myself as thorough) from Le Morte D'Arthur to The Da Vinci Code and sadly this falls into the latter category. The main difference between Kate Mosse and Dan Brown is that Kate appears to have done her research. Her story's relationship to legend and even actual historical events is a little less tenuous that Brown's, her grasp of English is infinitely better (not hard), as is her grasp I've read a lot of books on the Holy Grail in my time (some may say an obsessive amount, I prefer to think of myself as thorough) from Le Morte D'Arthur to The Da Vinci Code and sadly this falls into the latter category.

Her story's relationship to legend and even actual historical events is a little less tenuous that Brown's, her grasp of English is infinitely better (not hard), as is her grasp of basic French geography (note to Dan Brown: Try looking at a map of Paris at the very least before writing about the City. If you turn left out of the Louvre you do not \u2026 oh I digress, you get the picture, this is not meant to be \"Rachel slating Dan Brown again\"). Like The Da Vinci Code there are times when the bad writing style (that endless use of italics to denote a character is thinking, what's that about? I am capable of working that out for myself) is so bad you want to throw the book across the floor but sadly the plot is so gripping that you have to read it until the very end. Having said all that, Labyrinth has a lot of redeeming qualities. Firstly it's a time-slip book - half of it being set during the 13th century when the Crusaders began to turn on their own. Mosse has done a lot of intricate research into this time and really conjures up the atmosphere of medieval France as well as many who have gone before her. Secondly, the characterisation is very strong and you actually feel for all the characters in one way or another. Thirdly, it's a Grail book in which women actually get heard. If what I've deduced about Grail mythology is correct women did play an important role and I think this is what Dan Brown was rather clumsily trying to say with all his very badly misinformed Mary Magdalene information. Mosse gets the message across a little better. In conclusion: overly long, overly hyped and badly edited, but conversely I did enjoy it and it's a thousand times better than anything Dan Brown could write ...more This pulled at me and repulsed me simultaneously.

The additional lack of explanation about why certain items (i.e. the Labyrinth, the cave, the ring, the grail, etc.) were important or how they had come to be were entirely ignored.

The background of the 13th century is the persecution of the Cathars in Languedoc; in the 20th century it is an archealogical dig in the same area. The whole grail thing is dressed up in slightly different robes; three old Egyptian books, a ring with a labyrinth on it, a similar bit of stone, a special cave, seversl dudes who live for centuries, a small amount of blood from people of different religions: liberally mix them up and chuck them around France and there you have it. Add some splendid villains, a few manic Catholics (a la Opus Dei in Dan Brown) and you have a mystery; spice with a few romances, some infidelity, some hopeless yearning and a spot of medieval siege warfare and serve to the readers. I think any archaelogist reading this would be horrified as I'm pretty sure that digs don't function in the way this one did. The historical part is full of holes, the switching centuries can be irritating and the whole plot requires a significant suspension of disbelief. However, it is well written, better than Dan Brown and reads easily. It also had the merit of sending me to sleep on a number of occasions. This may sound like I didn't really like it, but I've read many worse books in my time (anyone remember The Late Great Planet Earth; yes I really read that in my teens!) and it rattled along at a decent pace. It didn't seem 700 pages long; assuming of course I haven't dreamt reading half of it! ...more I read this book some time ago, and have recently been reminded of its sorry existence by the fact that a dramatisation is due to be screened in the not so distant future.

I didn't read The Da Vinci Code, but given that it was impossible to avoid or ignore, I understand both books tackle some similar themes. The strongest aspect of \"Labyrinth\" is that the plot is well-paced and engrossing. The back-and-forth between the medieval era and the present day generally works nicely, and the transitions are smooth, or make sense in their placement and timing.

The back-and-forth between the medieval era and the present day generally works nicely, and the transitions are smooth, or make sense in their placement and timing. Most of the characters are well-drawn, although I do think it gets quite confusing keeping track of all of them, and a few could have been dropped or at least had their plot lines great reduced (such as Noubel, the policeman). I enjoy novels set in the medieval era as a guilty pleasure, as I often find they are saddled with ridiculous, stilted language and rather heavy-handed, melodramatic plots. While parts of \"Labyrinth\" are a bit silly (such as the sex scenes, oh brother), overall the plot is actually quite moving. The persecution of the Cathars, a heretic sect in thirteenth-century France, is handled deftly and movingly. Some of the material about the Grail was a bit complicated, I thought, and unnecessarily so. This is a far from perfect book--as others have noted, this really could have been edited into a much leaner story. But the author clearly knows her material, and overall the history and religion are handled intelligently. This is an enjoyable read that you don't have to feel guilty about indulging in, as you actually come away having learned some medieval history. ...more Rating Clarification: 2.5 Stars Had potential to be a thrilling, page-turning read, but the story never seemed to take off.

I loved this book The book, for me, really developted in the last 300 pages. It took me a long time to get past the first part of the book (mainly because of all the not so important descriptions of everything), but after that an amazing and mysterious story was created, which was what I expected when I started to read the book. I would love to give it five stars, but because of the first part I must give it four. LABYRINTH BY KATE MOSSE: If only Kate Mosse had published her novel not in 2006, but shortly after the astonishing success of the Da Vinci Code, it perhaps would\u2019ve received the literary respect it deserves, instead of coming last in a slew of novels involving the subjects of the Holy Grail, the Knights Templar, and what they mean in the present day.

The quote on the back of the paperback edition from the Kirkus Review really says it all: \u201cA quickly paced adventure that wears its considerable learning lightly \u2013 and of higher literary quality than The Da Vinci Code, to which it will inevitably be compared.\u201d And yet Labyrinth goes more than a few steps further, not just adding new and original twists to the myth of the grail, but adding a new depth and level that hasn\u2019t been seen before. As for the truth behind it all, Mosse doesn\u2019t offer a note of explanation, but leaves it to the reader\u2019s imagination. Labyrinth opens with one of the two main characters, Alice, working on an archaeological site in southern France, where she finds a hidden cave and two skeletons within. She also finds a unique ring bearing an unusual symbol: a labyrinth. Notifying the authorities of the discovered site, with the skeletons it suddenly becomes a crime scene, and the archaeologists are kicked off the site. The reader is then taken back in time to the thirteenth century, where they meet the other main character, Ala\u00efs, a young girl held back by tradition and ritual in a chivalric society where the knight and the priest are strongest. For the duration of the book, the reader follows these two characters, as they live their lives in parallel. As Alice returns to her hotel, strange things start to happen, as strangers contact her about what she found in the cave, police telling her to describe exactly what she saw and confiscating her sketches. Members of the dig go mysteriously missing, as people begin to die for unknown reasons. Finding pieces of evidence, Alice weaves together the story bit by bit, and as she does she discovers that she is intrinsically linked to it all, and most importantly to Ala\u00efs. Her strange dreams of this unknown girl from the late Middle Ages are the least of her worries. Ala\u00efs finds herself caught up in the changing and challenging times when the pope launches a crusade against the Cathars, a declared heretic group who believe that while God is absolute and utmost, the work they do in their lives is by their doing and not God\u2019s. It is a time when Christians are fighting Christians overtly because of their supposed heretical ways, but subversively because the northern French want the rich southern land of the langue d\u2019Oc. Wrapped in this dense plot is the story of the Grail, which every Christian of every group seeks, and it is only when the three ancient texts with the strange hieroglyphs are brought together, that the true way to the Grail will be shown. But the story of this Grail is not the one that we all think we know, but something deeper and more ancient that is tied in with this mysterious symbol of the labyrinth, and reaches back into Ancient Egypt and the founding of civilization. While the last third of the book seems somewhat rushed, as Mosse forgoes the back and forth chapters through time, and relies on present day characters telling what they know of the past; there is an inevitable building that results in a climactic ending of not just character realization, but eye-opening shock on the reader\u2019s part, as they finally know the whole story. Like the symbol, Labyrinth is a story that begins simple and straightforward, but grows more and more complex, until the denouement when all is revealed and finally understood.

Her characters were too typical and too perfect. They were either perfect good people or perfect villians and she spent too much time with physical descriptions. Good character descriptions are much harder than they seem and some authors have a real gift for it (Jane Austen & Susannah Clarke are two examples). The most important rule for them is that less is more. An author can say more about a character with a few well chosen words than he can in a page of adjectives. I had high hopes for this book because the plot soudned intriguing and I think it could have been fun and interesting with the right editor. ...more I had hopes for this: massive bestseller in the UK, feminist retelling of the Grail legend, shuttling between the 13th and 21st centuries, lots of sex and swords -- promising!

And when your big ideas involve reincarnation and historical symmetry, and when the main manifestation of this symmetry is both heroines losing consciousness every ten pages, it basically flogs the sex and the swords into one big pile of MEH. Obviously, the true test of any Grail-themed work is how well it stands up to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade -- and even correcting for the cinematic awesomeness of immortality-hunting Nazis and the kooky knight intoning \"You have chosen...wisely\", Labyrinth doesn't come close. ...more I thought this was a really crap book.

I was intrigued by the idea of an historical fiction book geared towards adults. But after reading the first two chapters I threw it away. I am not certain why as I don't remember any specific details. I do remember that I thought it was better written than many New York Times best sellers but that it wasn't for me. Oh this book.

If you're like me and stubborn, you'll no doubt go along before that point hoping that you'll understand what it all means by context alone. Well, good luck with that one. I ended up giving up and googling it, so that I could understand the book better. By the time it came up in the book, I was already informed by Google and Wikipedia. Then we have the sex scenes. Were they necessary? I mean, were they really necessary? I know i'm a ~fade to black~ kind of reader, so maybe I'm just being biased, but considering there's other parts of the story were the author just skimmed over a summary instead of delving once again into the nth detail, I really don't see why they were needed when a sum up of an extra marital affair would have done the same job. And then, Then, we have the weird ~lets throw that in there~ romance. Will, a randomer Alice had met once before, years before, meets her again, they might have been in each others company for four hours, and he's pining after her and stroking her face and kissing her and Interrupting her when she's actually asking a very important valid question? He spent more time unconscious than he had in her company! And last but not least is the ending. I don't know if a book can jump the shark, but just after what I'll spoiler-freeingly call The Mirror Scene, a dying character spends what is the reading time equivalent of fifteen minutes explaining his life story.

July 2005. In the Pyrenees mountains near Carcassonne, Alice, a volunteer at an archaeological dig stumbles into a cave and makes a startling discovery-two crumbling skeletons, strange writings on the walls, and the pattern of a labyrinth; between the skeletons, a stone ring, and a small leather bag. Eight hundred years earlier, on the eve of a brutal crusade to stamp out heresy that will rip apart southern France, Alais is given a ring and a mysterious book for safekeeping by her father as he leaves to fight the crusaders. The book, he says, contains the secret of the true Grail, and the ring, inscribed with a labyrinth, will identify a guardian of the Grail. As crusading armies led by Church potentates and nobles of northern France gather outside the city walls of Carcassonne, it will take great sacrifice to keep the secret of the labyrinth safe. In the present, another woman sees the find as a means to the political power she craves; while a man who has great power will kill to destroy all traces of the discovery and everyone who stands in his way.

A Templar-esque secret society, mysterious archaeological discoveries, and drawn out cookie-cutter action scenes make up one half of this novel. the other half takes us back to medieval France where events that are the precursors of the modern story take place. The historical part is far more interesting, seeing as how the modern part consists of hardly anything but the main character getting chased from point A to point B by thugs. Just once, I wish someone would write a book based on this premise, but left the thugs out of it, and took time to actually develop the plot. Despite all this, I'm sure there were a few redeeming qualities in there somewhere. I just can't think of any right now. ...more The inside cover stuff instantly intrigued me. I'm all about mysterious/secret, lesser-known histories. And the story of the Grail is one of the most well-known of the lesser-known histories. Or even myths. While this one doesn't go into my favorite theory, it's such a page turner. You learn of both Alice and Alais in alternating chapters, and I really have to give the author credit, for both the creativity and the amount of research that went into this book.

The language, the history. Truly amazing. I'd like to own this. Even though it won't have that same suspense in a second reading, I think I'll pick up on smaller nuances. And ya know what? There's real history in there, too. The Crusades, obviously. Some history of the Cathars, history of France, real people that existed. Seriously. Read this. ...more Labyrinth kept me reading in bed under a nice comfortable duvet for many nights. I love the transition between the two time periods. It was done with finesse. Although I was a little dissapointed by some stinted writing and bad editing, Labyrinth still had me sitting on the edge of my seat trying to figure out what is going on. The characters tend to be two dimensional but they draw you in nonetheless. Ms. Mosse sometimes went too far with certain details (Noubel's profusive sweating - what is that about? too much info fer sure, and the sex scenes seemed to have been copied & pasted from a harlequin novel) and then did not give enough detail where Although I was a little dissapointed by some stinted writing and bad editing, Labyrinth still had me sitting on the edge of my seat trying to figure out what is going on.

Ms. Mosse sometimes went too far with certain details (Noubel's profusive sweating - what is that about? too much info fer sure, and the sex scenes seemed to have been copied & pasted from a harlequin novel) and then did not give enough detail where warranted (the Cathars and how they came to be). The book is pretty fast paced and the one big compliment I can give to Ms. Mosse is that you can see how much she has come to love the region of Languedoc and its history. The region became a central character for me and I came to love it. She captured the desperation, terror and subsequent sadness of the inhabitants of that region and time. Ms. Mosse handled the persecution of the Cathars with great care and gave me a reason to further research their history and the French Crusade of 1209. ...more If anyone enjoyed the Davinci Code by Dan Brown, you'll enjoy this. Like some of the other reviews, there were times I liked the story and there were other times where I was just down right bored. The story line drew me in - two different lives were connected by history yet born centuries apart. Yet, there were several loose ends. Why did the father hate Guilhem du Mas? And if he disliked him so much, why would he allow his daughter marry him? Then in the future, I suppose when all was forgiven, why did Mosse not include the story line of Alais' rescue and the t Like some of the other reviews, there were times I liked the story and there were other times where I was just down right bored. The story line drew me in - two different lives were connected by history yet born centuries apart. Yet, there were several loose ends. Why did the father hate Guilhem du Mas? And if he disliked him so much, why would he allow his daughter marry him? Then in the future, I suppose when all was forgiven, why did Mosse not include the story line of Alais' rescue and the time they had a child together and then jump 30 years later to an older Alais? After this part, I just had no interest to finish the book. But, considering I already made it 500 pages, I thought I might as well finish it. What is Marie-Cecile's connection to the characters in the 13th century period? Is she the reincarnation of Oriane? Is Will also the reincarnation of Guilhem? Why were so many of the main characters not given enough of a background? Why is the history of the cave and the elements of the ritual itself not discussed? More detail please!!! I guess my main issue is that there were so many characters, not enough story line, and then loose ends. I am giving the book 2 stars because the story itself was intriguing and at times had me sitting on edge. But, it just felt like there was an entire section of the book that Mosse wrote but then chose not to include. It read like a bad movie adaptation. ...more I can never read too many grail quest yarns. This one doesn't have quite as infectious a pace as The Da Vinci Code. The style of prose ventures closer to literary than Dan Brown's strictly commercial blockbuster. Labyrinth also had me struggling to remember my high school and freshman year of college French lessons, for whatever that's worth. The narrative provides readers with two stories to follow (somewhat similar to Raymond Khoury's The Templar Salvation), one taking place in the present and I can never read too many grail quest yarns.

Labyrinth also had me struggling to remember my high school and freshman year of college French lessons, for whatever that's worth. The narrative provides readers with two stories to follow (somewhat similar to Raymond Khoury's The Templar Salvation), one taking place in the present and the other in the distant past, the two racing to reach a point where they will merge. There are a good deal of characters to keep track of (perhaps a couple too many for my taste) with prime spots going to women. So I suppose this is the most feminist of the grail chase books I've read to date. It won't be the last, as I simply can't get enough of them. And I may return to the fiction of Kate Mosse someday, because even though this novel didn't quite wow me, it was crafted well enough to have me hooked to the end. ...more 3.5 stars. I enjoyed this book. I would say it's great except for the speed of the book. Some parts contain too much detail and description that it just drags and you're left skimming through those parts or you find yourself distracted from the story doing something else instead. Other than that, I enjoyed the characters. I am okay with how things turned out for everyone. The subject matter is one I'd never read about - the Cathars in the south of France. Frankly, I'd never heard of them. Victim 3.5 stars. I enjoyed this book. I would say it's great except for the speed of the book.

The sad part is that this really didn't need to be about the Holy Grail at all. It could have been called anything. Like so many other recent interpretations, this Grail isn't the cup of Christ, and indeed has nothing to do with Jesus at all. The closest you get is the story of the Crusaders versus the Cathars in 13th century France, whose narrative is intertwined with the modern-day tale of an English woman who stumbles upon a strange cave during an archaeological dig. That part is vivid and gripping. The mystic weirdness surrounding the Holy Grail, not so much. It is hard to follow and just a tad silly. That is not to say that this is not worth reading. The descriptions alone instilled me with a deep desire to tour France; the characters, while not especially deep, were sympathetic and easily distinguishable. The truth is, the amount of research that clearly went into writing this book is enough to convince me to pick up Mosse's next book, if only to revel in the lush details of whatever historical period she chooses. If you like historical fiction, have no qualms with loopy magical realism, and aren't too touchy about frequent jabs at the medieval Christian church, you will enjoy this book. As for me, it was a nice peek into a time and place I'd never given much thought. Hopefully Mosse's other works will make a little more sense on the miraculous end. ...more", "Title": "Labyrinth"},
