Protect sharehold Naomi\u2019s Klein\u2019s This Changes Everything is absolutely essential for understanding, confronting, and meeting the challenges of the 21st century. I recommend it to everyone. Naomi Klein is known for her activism and her reporting on corporate malfeasance \u2013 the misused power of corporations, and the deleterious effects of unfettered global free-market western-style capitalism unchained from any conceivable governance that might restrict profitability. Profits first, above all else. Protect shareholder interests, increase shareholder wealth. With this,<---M> her newest book</---M>, This Changes Everything , she turns to the consequences that this unrestricted capitalism is having on the world at large. Deregulated and globalized capitalism, which destroys the middle classes across the world, destabilizes societies, increases inequality, and enriches the already fantastically wealthy, is ultimately threatening a lot more than people and communities. Our globalized capitalistic system now threatens the stability and resilience of the natural world, our environment, of which we are intrinsically and inseparably a part. After speaking about her own reluctance to face the facts about climate change, a reticence to confront the reality of climate change and global warming and focus on social issues, she decided a few years ago that she must confront it and learn about it. I agree, these issues are too important to be left to so-called \u201cenvironmentalists\u201d, \u201chippies\u201d, \u201ctree-huggers\u201d and such. We must now all become environmentalists. Klein first shows what really is happening across the world today, as we strive to feed the god of economic growth and disregard the ugly sights of its victims: \"\u2026 the regular people: the workers who lose their factory jobs in Ju\u00e1rez and Windsor, the workers who get the factory jobs in Shenzen and Dhaka, jobs that are by this point so degraded that some employers install nets along the perimeters of roofs to catch employees when they jump, or where safety codes are so lax that workers are killed in the hundreds when buildings collapse. The victims are also the toddlers mouthing lead-laden toys; the Walmart employee expected to work over the Thanksgiving holiday only to be trampled by a stampede of frenzied customers, while still not earning a living wage. And the Chinese villages whose water is contaminated by one of those coal plants we use as our excuse for inaction, as well as the middle class of Beijing and Shanghai whose kids are forced to play inside because the air is so foul.\u201d Her conclusion is startling: \u2026 the bottom line is what matters here: our economic system and our planetary system are now at war. Or, more accurately, our economy is at war with many forms of life on earth, including human life. What the climate needs to avoid collapse is a contraction in humanity\u2019s use of resources; what our economic model demands to avoid collapse is unfettered expansion. Only one of these sets of rules can be changed, it it\u2019s not the laws of nature.\u201d The philosophy and the worldview that got us here began with the European scientific revolution, a revolution of thought which changed humankind\u2019s relation to the natural world. For all that the scientific revolution has done, vastly increasing the life chances of billions of people across the past few centuries, changing our very civilization and reshaping our societies in the span of just a few generations, the scientific worldview also estranged us from the natural world, by placing us outside of it, as the impartial observer, which can meddle with the world - yet not be affected by it. The steam engine allowed for power generation anywhere it went, regardless of weather, in rain and sun, regardless of its surroundings. This engine, and its progeny, changed the world \u2013 in fact, built the modern world. But the whole time, these engines of the modern world were powered by fossil fuels. Fuels that are non-renewable, energy intensive, require extraction from the ground by way of the coal and oil and natural gas industry. And they expel carbon dioxide and other gases and pollutants into the atmosphere. For hundreds of years, \u201cextractivism\u201d has treated our natural world as a vast warehouse that we can take from indefinitely. We view lakes and forests and oceans as \u201cresources\u201d \u2013 a phrase that belies the economic nature of our view of them. Our lakes and forests really just \u201cresources\u201d, like bank accounts and wallets, to be withdrawn from? This cannot continue indefinitely, and our methods of extraction have gotten continually more costly, destructive, and noxious. The figures on fracking alone are horrifying, including the pumping of millions of gallons of water and over 190+ toxic chemicals 8,000 feet underground in order to fracture solid rock and have it expel natural gas. Whole mountain chains, along with their flora and fauna are absolutely annihilated, to extract coal, shale, and natural gas. Most insultingly, the flora and fauna, the forests and animals, are labeled \u201coverburden\u201d to the fracking companies. The results on human populations are also ugly: \"mothers living in the areas with the most natural gas development were 30 percent more likely to have babies with congenital heart defects than those who lived in areas with no gas wells near their home. They also found some evidence that high levels of maternal exposure to gas extraction increased the risks of neurological defects.\" (to learn more about fracking, see Gasland The oil, natural gas, mining and logging companies, multinational in nature, have expeditions on every continent. If they are stopped in one country, they can resort to free trade treaties and plead that restrictions on mining is against free trade. And they simply go elsewhere, to where the locals are too poor to organize, or too poor to refuse the influx of temporary money and mining jobs, or to where they can buy off the governments. A number of solutions are put forward, along with significant victories across the world. Looking to the annual reports of the oil companies, if what they call \u201cproven reserves\u201d are actually utilized, the total emissions from those reserves is many times more than what environmental experts concede will increase the world\u2019s temperature by over 4\u00ba Celsius. That increase will have devastating consequences for many millions across the world, as the oceans rise and acidify, as global temperature increases and climate is more severe \u2013 with more severe draughts and flood, more severe storms, massive disruption to many ecosystems and climates. And these companies have in their official statements that they intend to extract from these reserves, so we know exactly what they intend to do, and we know what the consequences will be if they are not stopped. It's as simple as that. We need renewal energy, wind and solar, and we need them now. Natural gas is just as polluting as coal - in fact, it may be more polluting. But there is resistance to change from the ways we already know. And to climate deniers, all these fancy, new-fangled wind turbines and solar panels are too threatening, they are not as sturdy as a good old internal combustion engine. And as Klein points out, letting go of our power to generate energy to the vagaries of nature, to sunlight and wind, is against our worldview and modern, scientific-minded outlook, where humankind is the \u201cmaster\u201d of nature, to direct as we choose. Real men burn coal. What about geoengineering? Klein addresses this also, devoting a whole chapter to it (\u2018Dimming the Sun\u2019). I\u2019ll leave it to the reader to explore, merely noting that the worldview which made humankind the ruler of the natural world is the same worldview which thinks that it can engineer whole planets with grand schemes like space-based shields to block out the sun, or by disbursing particulates in the upper atmosphere to reflect the sun's rays back out of the atmosphere. Do we really want to play around with this technology, and in lieu of renewable energy like solar and wind? Aren\u2019t the emissions trading schemes going to solve this problem? The various emissions trading schemes, where countries establish limits for their emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and then domestic companies are allotted specific limits, and can buy and sell them amongst each other, or get offsets by conducting emissions-mitigating activity, are widespread. However, there are multiple loopholes and unaccounted emissions. For example, ships on the high seas, which put massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the air, are not emissions that any one particular country is responsible for. Their emissions simply are not under the rules. Other loopholes exist, such as getting credit for reducing emissions from refraining from activity that was illegal anyway, such as illegal but cheaper \u201cflaring\u201d of gas chimneys at mines in Nigeria. As Klein puts it \u201cWith emissions up by about 57% since the U.N. Climate convention was signed in 1992, the failure of this polite strategy is beyond debate.\u201d The sad tale of trading in pollution ultimately reflects the flawed view that market-based solutions are the only politically-feasible method of tackling emissions. In conclusion, this book is timely, crucial, and to be welcomed as a refocusing of our attentions and priorities. There are many across the world who already are laboring thanklessly to prevent further destruction of our environment, but those with other priorities, and who live removed from nature, can easily forget what is happening. Klein writes: \u201cThe deep sense of interdependence with the natural world that animates rural struggles from Greece to coastal British Columbia is, of course, rather less obvious in the densely populated cities where so many of us live and work: where our reliance on nature is well hidden by highways, pipes, electrical lines, and overstocked supermarkets.\" The epiphany is that rather than being masters of the Earth, to engineer our world and extract every last drop of \u201cresources\u201d for our profit, we are the Earth\u2019s stewards (at best), and we live inside its systems. Where do we go from here? First realize that we are \u201cproducts of our age and of a dominant ideological project. One that too often has taught us to see ourselves as little more than singular, gratification-seeking units, out to maximize our narrow advantage\u2026\u201d If we focus solely on ourselves, we will never see the threat which endangers us all. Once alerted to this threat, we need to work to say \"No\" to extractavist policies, \"No\" to investment in fossil industries, and \"Yes\" to renewable energies. What do you want to do with your life? Do you want to amass toys and capital for your personal enjoyment while the Earth itself is warped beyond habitability? Or, do you want to take part with people across the globe with similar outlooks and through similar efforts to make a sustainable future for us all? I am very inspired by this book and I cannot wait for others to read it and react to it. In all honesty, I intend to alter my actions and take part in activism to combat climate change. ...more Climate change is not liberal propaganda There is only one truth you need to know - from this book, from this review: Denying climate change is profitable, and as long as it remains profitable, the environment degrades. It will get to a point of no return. Do you want to do something now voluntarily or be forced to do something later, when it\u2019s probably too late? \u201cIn the face of an absolutely unprecedented emergency, society has no choice but to take dramatic action to avert a collapse of civiliz Climate change is not liberal propaganda There is only one truth you need to know - from this book, from this review: Denying climate change is profitable, and as long as it remains profitable, the environment degrades.

Do you want to do something now voluntarily or be forced to do something later, when it\u2019s probably too late? \u201cIn the face of an absolutely unprecedented emergency, society has no choice but to take dramatic action to avert a collapse of civilization. Either we will change our ways and build an entirely new kind of global society, or they will be changed for us.\u201d Fossil fuel companies are among the most profitable and they are destroying the planet on the fast track enabled by lobbyists and politicians, because it\u2019s more economical (and profitable) for them to do so than to change what they are doing. Do you want to give BP a dollar so you can drive a Suburban, or do you want to deny BP that dollar (or cut it back to .20 cents) and drive a hybrid? These choices are ours to make and the only way the fossil fuel companies will hear us is economically, because they don\u2019t care about us ecologically. Corporations whose primary objective are profits cannot be allowed to influence decisions about the PLANET. Poor nations suffer because rich nations pollute. When things get bad, the poor nations will be the first to go. \u201cMedia commentators speak of \u2018compassion fatigue\u2019, as if empathy, and not fossil fuels was the finite resource.\u201d We are living beyond our environmental budget, and the bill is coming due. It\u2019s hard to write a review of this book without discussion how you feel about the topic. How you process the information. This book is, to some degree, preaching to the choir. Klein is radical, and this book is no holds barred. Right-wing Americans aren\u2019t going to read this and suddenly say \u201cOh, wow, I get it now. My bad.\u201d If we go down party lines, only 50%(ish) of Americans believe climate change is something which needs to be addressed. Unfortunately, the \u201cother\u201d 50%(ish) control corporations and lobbyists. Better planet, one way or another, results in lower profits. Or a complete breakdown of certain industries. Cheap goods from China? Bad for the environment, good for Wal-Mart. You could see why Wal-Mart (as an example) would want to deny climate change. You know why the sky in China is brown? So we can have cheap goods. And guess what? It\u2019s not entirely China\u2019s fault. Every time we buy some tchotchke, pan, coffee mug, electronic device \u201cmade in China\u201d we are contributing to climate change. We need to consume less, and we need to consume more thoughtfully - Buy local (do we really need asparagus which traveled 7,500 miles?) Think about the corporations you support and where your goods are coming from. Corporations are making deliberate decisions for profit which hasten climate change. This is a book for people who want to understand the economics of climate change. Who want to make educated buying decisions. Saving the planet isn\u2019t just about biking to work one day a week, it\u2019s thinking about where and how you spend your money. ...more I have read to of Klein's other books and will admit none of them read as well as Shock Doctrine . This Changes Everything reads more like a thesis than a marketed book. Nearly half of the book is documentation and source material. If Klein says it, she backs it up.

America prides itself on being a capitalist nation, but that in itself is a misnomer. Road I have read to of Klein's other books and will admit none of them read as well as Shock Doctrine . This Changes Everything reads more like a thesis than a marketed book. Nearly half of the book is documentation and source material. If Klein says it, she backs it up. My thoughts: The problem is not so much capitalism, but what capitalism has become. Capitalism has had its problems from sweatshops to slavery. America prides itself on being a capitalist nation, but that in itself is a misnomer. Roads, police, air space, food, education, snow removal, water and sewage are all controlled by one of the several layers of government and paid for by public funds. Many people hate socialism, unless it is their water, their children's education, their roads with potholes. Klein's view of capitalism is the current system we are experiencing. Not to sound archaic but the system was much more local in the past. Local areas provided are fairly closed loop. You bought something and you expected it to last. You visited bakers, butchers, and farmers markets. This system worked well until people found that bigger was better. Bigger stores meant cheaper prices. Chains grew Walmart came into play. Things still went ok because things were still made at home. The next step was imports, which were cheaper, but not produced at home -- this cost jobs. America started to think free trade might not be in its interest. Protective tariffs tried to save industry, but industry moved overseas. WTO and NAFTA came about to insure free (or fair) trade. The move was to globalization. This was the system of efficiency. Let each nation build what it builds best and trade. Win-win for everyone. The problem with increased efficiency is there are much more finished goods being produced everyone bought what they needed. What to do after everyone has what they need? How many televisions, cars, or pairs of shoes does one person need? Advertise, make cosmetic changes, create a want and when that doesn't work planned obsolesce. More manufacturing, more power consumption, more cars, and a new cell phone every two years. More waste, more coal power plants. It's ok to be poor, you have an Iphone. The system puts a strain on the planet. Ninety-seven percent of the scientist agree that man made climate change is real. The dissent does not present much of a case, except for things like if you live in Montana global warming will give better crop yields and longer growing seasons. It is mostly the poor that will need to adapt because the poor live in hot climates. (This Texas resident really questions that logic). A big part of the problem is the politicization of the problem. In the 1990s, both parties recognized the problem. Newt Gingrich spoke on needing to change our ways. That has all changed and the issue has become partisan, much like school vouchers or tax cuts. Climate change, however, cannot be legislated away. If science is right, there will be a tipping point where no matter what we do, we won't be able to fix, stop, or slow climate change. When countries move to become green they are attacked. In 2010 United States challenged China wind power program because it was protectionist. Likewise, the Indian Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission was challenged because it encouraged local industry. Even more outrageous was the US challenge against Quebec legislation banning fracking. It was challenged on the grounds that it cut off gas resources to potential industries. These actions may sound a bit odd, but it is little different from colonization. National sovereignty is becoming a thing of the past. Mass transportation systems are another topic mentioned in cutting greenhouse gasses. America calls investing in public transportation subsidies, but using tax money to build new roads is called an investment. Change can come, but it needs to be a movement. Slavery was not crisis for the American elites, until abolition became a movement. Civil rights was not an issue for many until Northerners saw the dogs and fire hoses turned on American citizens. The First Nation peoples of Canada are making progress in stopping pipelines, tar fields, and mining on their lands. It seems to be making a difference. Klein uses environmental issues to attack the \"capitalism\" we have today. This book is filled with documented information. The reading can be a bit dry and even burdensome at times but well worth the read. Klein tackles both the environment (and she does not hesitate to call out the failures of environmental organizations) and the economy. This Changes Everything is a call to remember when you find yourself in a hole, the first thing you need to do is stop digging. ...more In reading Naomi Klein\u2019s new book, This Changes Everything - a friendly-looking tome with a sky-blue cover - I couldn\u2019t help but recall what Whittaker Chambers\u2019 remark, in reviewing Ayn Rand\u2019s classic that, \u201c(f)rom almost any page of Atlas Shrugged, a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: \u201cto the gas chambers \u2014 go!\u201d\u201d This is a book that will seduce many people with its tales of various indigenous people standing up against further development and its surface-level commitment to In reading Naomi Klein\u2019s new book, This Changes Everything - a friendly-looking tome with a sky-blue cover - I couldn\u2019t help but recall what Whittaker Chambers\u2019 remark, in reviewing Ayn Rand\u2019s classic that, \u201c(f)rom almost any page of Atlas Shrugged, a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: \u201cto the gas chambers \u2014 go!\u201d\u201d This is a book that will seduce many people with its tales of various indigenous people standing up against further development and its surface-level commitment to humanitarian aims, but it is also the work of profound evil. This is a totalitarian book that aims to advance totalitarian aims in the guise of combating a supposed emergency. As Klein herself admits, she herself truly began to engage with these issues only when she realized that the aims of environmental radicalism provided a rationale for the adoption of ultra-left positions more generally. In writing this book, Klein has done the world a profound service in a surely-unintended fashion: she has set out in crystal-clear fashion the slightly-hidden agenda that lies behind most so-called \u201cenvironmental\u201d initiatives: the destruction of capitalism and Western Civilization. If you think my last sentence was hyperbolic, you should read the book yourself. In it Klein advocates a program that would see a radical redistribution of wealth, not only from the \u201c1% to the 99% within the advanced industrial nations, but on a global basis. She approvingly quotes one academic as, \u201cenvision(ing) that \u201chours of paid work and income could converge worldwide at substantially lower levels than is seen in the developed countries of today.\u201d\u201d When I read that sentence, I was temporarily floored. It is clear enough to myself that the aim of a notable portion of the present-day left is to take what you, I, and our families have and give it away in the name of \u201csocial justice\u201d, but it\u2019s rare to see it admittedly so openly. How many in the West would ever willingly accept having our standard of living \u201ccoverage\u201d with that of Liberia? She tries to put as kind a spin on this as possible, writing that, \u201c(w)e will need to return to a lifestyle similar to the one we had in the 1970s\u201d in order to attempt to pull back the shock a little bit. But, I ask you, how many among us would sincerely and willingly see our standard of living rolled back by four or five decades? She does her best to disguise the sort of pain that she\u2019s proposing to inflict upon the majority of Canadians, Americans, and other citizens in advanced nations, as well as the fact that it is more or less it is impossible that such measures would ever be adopted on a voluntary basis. Here and there, however, the mask slips, which was when she writes that, \u201cif these sorts of demand-side emissions reductions are to take place on anything like the scale required, they cannot be left to the lifestyle decisions of earnest urbanites.\u201d Ah, there it is! These decisions, Klein and her ilk believe, as so important that they cannot be left to the people. Nowhere in her book, beyond in laying out a vapid and shiny vision of a mass-movement of various native peoples and local townspeople resisting oil development, does she ever get too explicit about how the practical politics of this change should be managed, but it doesn\u2019t take too much of a leap to infer that it would be impossible for her anti-capitalist revolutionary movement to operate in accord with basic constitutional liberties and the rule of law. What she proposes, in essence, is for a revolutionary mob to come along and take by force the property of others in the name of the Earth. What she proposes is for a massive increase in the powers of the state over the affairs of the people - one that could not be possibly gained by democratic consent in the timeframe that she suggests (before the end of his decade). When Klein invokes the increase in transit usage and home production of food that occurred during the Second World War as an example, she shows a little more of her hand: those measures were only possible within a context of near-absolute government control of society during a total war. It is a cliche to invoke Martin Niem\u00f6ller in a political debate, yet it is irresistible here. Her first targets - the oil companies and select billionaires - may have some aspects about them that are unappealing, but this is really about everyone. This is a vision for a Khemr Rouge-like Year Zero society that will harm practically everyone if even a small fraction of it is allowed to come to pass. \u201cIt is a matter of the well-off 20 percent in a population taking the largest cuts,\u201d Klein writes, but soon enough she adds that, \u201c(t)his does not mean the middle class is off the hook. To fund the kind of social programs that will make a just transition possible, taxes will have to raise for everyone but the poor.\u201d Later she add that this, \u201cis precisely why, when climate change diners claim that global warming is a plot to redistribute wealth, it\u2019s not (only) because they are paranoid. It\u2019s also because they are paying attention.\u201d Yet, strangely, Klein fails to ever truly engage with the sort of tenacious resistance that such measures would face not only among the oil barons and the other villains of her work, but among ordinary people who do not wish to see the work of generations and their own lives destroyed or stolen and \u201credistributed\u201d to others. If you would like to see your lifestyle \u201cconverge\u201d with that of Nepal, you are more than free to make such a thing happen immediately. If you wish to require that my standard of living be reduced until it is roughly the same as the global average, than you are going to not only need votes but also guns and armies. This is the single greatest flaw of this book: Klein unveils a totalitarian and world-transforming vision and acknowledges that there are ideologues whose ideas differ from hers that she is willing to accord at least intellectual respect to, but she never engages with the reality that there are millions of people - ordinary citizens - in the Western world who would die on the battlefield before they would ever consent to live in her nightmarish version of the future. Going through this book I thought of a moment in another work that I\u2019d be willing to bet that Klein is familiar with (since it came out of the febrile imagination of the far-left of the British Labour Party during the 1980s). The late 1980s mini-series A Very British Coup is horribly dated now (it was based upon an even-older novel). It imagines the election of a crypto-communist British Prime Minister (who, among other things, funds his wild spending by taking out a large loan from the Soviet Union) and the resistance to him by the United States and the British establishment. In the climactic showdown between the Prime Minister and the sinister head of MI5, the intelligence chief tells the Prime Minister that his ideals represent a threat to everything that he and his fathers have fought for over the centuries, yea onto the Middle Ages. The Prime Minister closes his reply by telling the head of MI5, \u201cdon\u2019t forget: I have ancestors too.\u201d Klein\u2019s mistake here is assuming that she and her allies have a monopoly on virtue. She assumes that they are the \u201cgood guys\u201d in this scenario, much as the old-line Marxists of earlier days held a position that took the virtue of \u201cthe workers\u201d as an established fact rather than the debatable and mixed proposition that it was. She forgets, in other words, that I have ancestors too and that those of us who believe in individual liberty and the heritage of the English-speaking peoples have things that we believe in every bit as passionately and that we are certain are just as right as the things that she and her followers believe in. By failing to account for this, her extremism ensures that, at best, those who share her beliefs will remain eternally consigned to the fringes of society and, at worst, if they are ever to gain a mass following and the opportunity to implement her ideals that she will not be ushering in paradise, but instead bring on bloody and brutal civil wars that will resemble, more than anything else, the terrible strife that nearly destroyed the Balkans two decades ago. ...more Klein has every reason to be depressed about the way governments the world over are relinquishing their responsibilities when it comes to air, water, and land pollution. Though she admits to faltering in looking forward to the future we have left for our children, in the end she does not quail: she comes to see that there is a glimmer of hope that humans might actually slow or stop other humans from destroying our habitat, and the habitat of other species on the planet. In fact, our salvation ma Klein has every reason to be depressed about the way governments the world over are relinquishing their responsibilities when it comes to air, water, and land pollution. Though she admits to faltering in looking forward to the future we have left for our children, in the end she does not quail: she comes to see that there is a glimmer of hope that humans might actually slow or stop other humans from destroying our habitat, and the habitat of other species on the planet. In fact, our salvation may only be possible if the electorate, the populace, refuse to accept what we are being offered by our governments and the corporations \u201cserving our needs.\u201d Oh, what a thing man is\u2026but Klein\u2019s concludes that \u201chumanity is not hopelessly selfish and greedy\u2014the image ceaselessly sold to us by everything from reality shows to neoclassical economics.\u201d Climate change is not merely about climate: Klein explains how it has always has been and always will be about social justice. It isn\u2019t about the politicians or corporations, really, any more, it is about us, though it is true that corporations \u201chave become the authors of the laws under which they operate\u2026In fact, current trade and investment rules provide legal grounds for foreign corporations to fight virtually any attempt by governments to restrict the exploitation of fossil fuels, particularly once a carbon deposit has attracted investment and extraction has begun. And when the aim of the investment is explicitly to export the oil, gas, and coal and sell it on the world market\u2014as is increasingly the case\u2014successful campaigns to block those exports could well be met with similar legal challenges, since imposing \u2018quantitative restrictions\u2019 on the free flow of goods across borders violates a fundamental tenet of trade law.\u201d Klein makes the inescapable point that we are currently legally bound to accept fracking, oil drilling, and coal extraction on or near our own land and that stopping it from happening requires court action. The poorest and most disenfranchised among us usually have the least tools, but fortunately in Canada and areas of the U.S., some native Indian communities find that the original land grants give them some clout when refusing extractive industry, a strange reversal of fortune in this era of \u201cDrill, baby, Drill.\u201d \u201dmany non-Native people are starting to realize that Indigenous rights\u2014if aggressively backed by court challenges, direct action, and mass movements demanding that they be respected\u2014may now represent the most powerful barriers protecting all of us from a future of climate chaos.\u201d This is about us. We have the power. Politicians and corporations just make the ride more comfortable or less. One could argue that they are not responsible for changing the world\u2014we are. So\u2026it is time to take action and put in place the kind of leadership we seek. Diverse constituencies must come together to make transformative change. Klein makes the point that the touted \u201cjobs\u201d that are reaped in building, for instance, the tar-sands pipeline would be swamped by the jobs created if that investment went into green investment. And speaking of investment, it is not enough, Klein asserts, merely to divest of extraction industry stocks, but it is also necessary to reinvest those monies in the place they might do the most good: \u201ctoday\u2019s climate movement does not have the luxury of simply saying no without simultaneously fighting for a series of transformative yeses\u2014the building blocks of our next economy that can provide good clean jobs, as well as a social safety net that cushions the hardships for those inevitably suffering hardships.\u201d A couple of months ago I reviewed Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt , a book the journalist Chris Hedges collaborated on with the graphic artist Joe Sacco. That book describes the \u201csacrifice zones\u201d in the United States that sustain the extractive industries and a corporate mindset, rather than considering of the wider body politic. Certain areas of the country and land are \u201csacrificed\u201d to degradation so that the rest of us can live comfortably. Klein mentions the same phenomenon, but she puts us in the driver seat: \u201cTo fail to [confront an imminent and unavoidable climate emergency]\u2014which is what we are collectively doing\u2014knowing full well that eventually the failure could force government to rationalize \u2018risking\u2019 turning whole nations, even subcontinents, into sacrifice zones, is a decision our children may judge as humanity\u2019s single most immoral act.\u201d Klein does discuss the responses and solutions proposed by scientists and corporate entities to obvious indications of climate change, to give the other side their say. But in wide discussions with the larger scientific community, the solutions thus far proposed all have hideous effects that may be worse than the problem. For instance, one idea that apparently has gained some traction is the concept of exploding sulfur dioxide particles into the atmosphere to reflect the sun\u2019s rays and some of its heat, similar to a volcanic eruption. Unfortunately, most scientists agree that this would have deleterious effects on monsoon and other weather patterns and certainly would have consequences we have not yet determined. In other words, the proposed fix is to carry on with our lifestyles and almost certainly do more damage, rather than thinking about how to conserve, protect, to think of the world and the creatures on it as a whole. We could utilize our best minds and skills to recreate our energy future, but that opportunity to date is being wasted on chimerical solutions rather than the more obvious one of paying attention . What Klein does show us, sadly, is how in the past green movement proponents and non-profits have tried to work with oil and gas companies but have ended up in their pockets: \u201cchummy green partnerships\u201d she calls it. \u201cThe climate movement has found its nonnegotiables\u2026and it is delivering some of the most significant victories the environmental movement has seen in decades.\u201d There is a movement afoot, and motion has been detected in pockets of resistance across America and the world. It is gaining mass and momentum, and she is urging us to jump onboard and make the changes we wish to see. We have the power. What use is despair? If we are going down, we might as well go down fighting. Klein quotes Yotam Marom, and organizer with Occupy Wall Street in New York: \u201cThe fight for climate isn\u2019t a separate movement, it\u2019s both a challenge and an opportunity for all of our movements. We don\u2019t need to become climate activists, we are climate activists. We don\u2019t need a separate climate movement; we need to seize the climate moment .\u201d Just possibly we might be able to change the world. This is a big book, but not a difficult or dense read, since undoubtedly the reader that picks up this book will be familiar with some of the facts. It is a fascinating discursive discussion covering the whole world when giving examples of pollution from and resistance to extractive industries. It is a massive collection and organization of information and a real work of generosity. Thank you, Naomi Klein! ...more This changes everything. I wish it did.

There is a LOT of ground covered in this book and an extensive amount of research. At times it became a bit too much and I was unclear what it's intentions were. I wanted a simpler solution, when of course there isn't one. Yet there were many great ideas and examples of how grassroots communities ARE working for the good of the climate. Which is usually in opposition to the global energy companies whose incentive is to make money. Then make some more. And more. Did I learn anything new? Yes, I learnt a lot. Not only about climate change, why it's A REAL PROBLEM and how this will affect everyone (no not hotter summers, yippee). I discovered more about why we're being pushed into extreme energy sources, what governments are(n't) doing about it and the roles ecological and green organisations play to help. Or not. I read about problems encountered by people who really do WANT TO HELP and how easy it is for their good intentions to be turned in another direction. I read a lot of things that made me angry. I expected multinational companies to be making big profits for themselves. I less expected them to be ignoring laws and legislature, simply because they have money and time on their side, to strip the earth of resources before communities can make LEGITIMATE claims through the courts. By which time it's too late to put the resources back in the ground. Is it such a novel idea just to keep them there? I think more people are beginning to think this way. Most populations don't want to live next to a nuclear plant, they don't want oil drilling in their back yard, or fracking on their doorstep. Demonstrations at ground level have stopped some of these things from happening and they're slowly pushing back the tide of these last wave extractions. More needs to happen of course. Saving one area at a time with protests is not enough and that's where some of the bigger ideas of this book come into play. Living in a more co-operative society, where that literally does what it says. Changing the global dominance of the way the world runs, when it's to the detriment of local jobs, resources, people, animals and land. Yet, I don't see that things will change. For things to be implemented as Naomi Klein suggests there would need to be a huge rethink on everyday life and a return to a simpler time. For a start, more growing, making and buying of local goods, rather than buying products that have flown halfway across the world because someone else can produce them cheaper. Free trade sounds like a positive thing, but it can also work against us. We're running out of resources to ship these goods back and forth across the world and if we continue down this path of mass consumption things will eventually come to a head. Coal, oil and gas aren't finite resources, they will run out. By which time it will be too late to start mass investment of real green alternatives. That needs to be happening right now. If we wait another 50 or 100 years too much damage will have been done, which can't be magically fixed. More people will live in land stripped communities, or be displaced from rising sea levels, or suffer from repeated famines due to crop failures. The west won't be exempt either, with increased natural disasters in the way of heat waves and forest fires, or extreme hurricanes. Perhaps in the future there will be an even more two tier society, with the rich living in air conditioned, flood defended, earthquake resistant structures. While the poor languish outside of these areas. Think hurricane Katrina style disaster on a global scale, year on year. Or your favourite dystopian novels come true. So what if all of this is wrong? What if the 97 percent of scientists who tell us global warming is happening, are actually mistaken? What if it isn't all our fault, it's actually a fluctuation of earth's natural temperatures and there isn't really a problem. Well, in this case, as Naomi Klein says, we'll just have made the world a fairer, better place for everyone, for no reason at all. What a shame that would be. ...more One giant eye-roll You make me facepalm, Naomi Klein. \" As our boat rocked [in the Louisiana Gulf Coast delta] I had the distinct feeling that we were suspended not in water, but in amniotic fluid, immersed in a massive multi-species miscarriage .\" If you want to change people's minds - right-wing, die-hard meritocracy-spouting capitalist human minds - you can't talk like this and expect them to listen.

It's fitting that Klein closes the book asking how Alexis Tsipras\u00b2 will answer to history \"knocking on [his] door.\" We already have that answer: by being forced by the EU, the ECB, and the IMF to cave on his election promises to dismantle austerity, utterly failing to achieve a debt write-down, and then spinning it as a victory. The Greek people are being forced into a \"humanitarian crisis\" to pay for the \u20ac237 billion in \"bailout\" funds that went directly to Greek and European financial institutions since May 2010. This is what is wrong with the realities of late-era capitalism, and it has nothing to do with metaphors of floating in amniotic fluid.

She filters all her information about the world through this moral lens, which results in simplistic and misleading conclusions. She describes this clearly when talking about other believers. She explains the tendency of some conservatives to reject the scientific understanding of climate change with perhaps the most insightful statement in her book: \u201cThe tight correlation between \u2018worldview\u2019 and acceptance of climate science is due to \u2018cultural cognition\u2019, the process by which all of us, regardless of political leanings, filter new information in ways that will protect our \u2018preferred vision of the good society\u2019.\u201d Filtering information to promote her preferred vision of the good society is exactly what this book is about. This is most evident when confronting the extremely complex scientific problem of climate change. The believing mind simply cannot comprehend the scientific method required to understand this issue. What We Know and Don\u2019t Know about Climate Change Scientists are reasonably certain that global warming is real and mainly caused by burning fossil fuels. Supporting this fact is beyond the scope of my review. If you disagree, you are under the spell of a different belief system. The problems begin when trying to understand how this will affect our future in the real world. Global warming does not mean there will be some terrible new climate. The climates we already have will move to different places. In general, climate zones will migrate toward the poles. If you want to know your future climate, look south. Of course, what exactly will happen in any particular region is more complex than that, but it is a good first approximation. How fast will the climate change? The answer involves a concept completely absent from Naomi Klein\u2019s thinking, which is uncertainty. The latest IPCC report (AR5) estimates the (equilibrium) climate sensitivity for temperature is between 1.5 and 4.5, which is quite a large range. At the low end we have plenty of time to transition to carbon free energy. At the high end some of the alarmism in this book may be justified, if wrong in detail. The problem with presenting a range like that is believers will pick the figure they want to believe. You just did that, didn\u2019t you? Those values are both unlikely extremes. The reality is most likely somewhere in between. The hard truth is we do not know how fast climate change will happen, and we do not know how it will affect any particular region. The effects of our actions today will not be felt until decades into the future. The effect of any individual\u2019s carbon dioxide production is felt globally. Therefore any solution must be global in scope, which is a problem for someone so viscerally opposed to globalization. Seeking Instant Gratification We all seek instant gratification. People want to use their fossil fuels today and not worry about future consequences. Thus to make people aware of climate change, we seek something with an immediate sensational impact \u2013 extreme weather. And what could be better than a hurricane, especially one that reaches New York. After all, when you hit Broadway you\u2019ve made the big time. Rising carbon dioxide levels lead directly to rising global temperatures. However, the link between that and extreme weather is secondary, and poorly understood. She claims that there has been a fivefold increase in these events since the 1970\u2019s. In reality, the IPCC report says, \u201cIt is likely that since about 1950 the number of heavy precipitation events over land has increased in more regions than it has decreased,\u201d and \u201cConfidence is low for a global-scale observed trend in drought or dryness (lack of rainfall) since the middle of the 20th century, owing to lack of direct observations, methodological uncertainties and geographical inconsistencies in the trends.\u201d In other words, she is flat out lying. There is little detectable trend so far. No one really knows how much more extreme weather there will be in the future, certainly not Naomi Klein. The Disconnect Between Capitalism and Climate Change Economics is seen as the big bad capitalists exploiting their innocent victims, the common people. This viewpoint neglects the detail that most of those people are also consumers who benefit from the system, even if not as much as they think they deserve to. There is one basic fact to keep in mind: burning fossil fuels is the cheapest way to produce energy, assuming we ignore the side effect of climate change. Fossil fuels are not some horror inflicted on us by greedy capitalism. The capitalist is responding to all the \u201cgreedy\u201d consumers who want to pay as little as possible for their energy. Look at who screams the loudest when gas prices go up. The notion that a transition to renewable energy threatens the structure of capitalism is nonsense. This could be done, in theory, with nuclear power, which currently produces about ten times the carbon free energy than all other renewable energy sources combined. The result would greatly increased centralization and concentration of power. But even a transition to solar energy would not change much. Large corporations would produce the solar panels, for the same reason they already produce our cars and computers. It is more efficient and gives consumers the lowest prices. A free market cannot address climate change because it does not measure the carbon dioxide externality. The solution is a tax on emissions to force markets to take this into account. There is no need to dream up an imaginary economic system to add to the uncertainty a changing climate will already bring. Wanting Something for Nothing Only a true believer could come up with this remarkable statement, which reflects the central message of the book: \u201cThe resources required to rapidly move away from fossil fuels and prepare for the coming heavy weather could pull huge swaths of humanity out of poverty, providing services now sorely lacking, from clean water to electricity.\u201d Read it again, replacing could with could instead . This is about a trade off, that most basic economic concept that Naomi Klein seems utterly incapable of understanding. The money invested in renewable energy and climate change adaptation (for \u2018heavy weather\u2019) comes out of the same pool that could be spent on alleviating poverty. Using renewable energy will make electricity cost more for everyone. These are upfront costs. Any benefits come in the future. The best example of a country that pulled huge swaths of humanity out of poverty is China. The inconvenient truth is they did it with unbridled capitalism, and burned a vast amount of coal doing it. It is the same for any other country that has reduced poverty. Hard Choices and False Choices The connection between income equality and climate change is actually negative. Lower income people use more energy per dollar than higher income people. Transferring wealth from the rich to the poor will increase carbon dioxide emissions. That is why China is now the largest and fasted growing carbon dioxide emitter. Unfortunately, the real world is about hard choices. Maybe we should invest in renewable energy, but in the short term it will reduce wealth for everyone. Maybe we should reduce income disparity, but it will increase the burning of fossil fuels. Of course, we can do it all for free by taking it away from the rich. Have you noticed that strategy has a rather poor track record? While some of the rich are parasites, others are the ones who create our new technology, including renewable energy. You can only eat the rich once, and the feast will not last very long. There is simply not as much wealth to be plundered from the wealthy as some might want to believe. What Happened to Property Rights? Much of this book is taken up with the campaigns of local people against resource development. It is all heartwarming stuff, and these people have a legitimate complaint about suffering damage to their health and property so others can benefit. But why do they have so little legal protection? Maybe because the Left is against property itself, and the Right defines property rights so narrowly that ordinary people are excluded. However noble some of these struggles may seem, they are ultimately about defending property. Klein gleefully reports that Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson joined a lawsuit against fracking near his $5 million Texas home, claiming it would lower his property values. This nicely illustrates the point that conflict over development has little to do with climate change. If you stop one project, more oil will be found elsewhere. If you prevent a pipeline from being built, the oil will be shipped on trains that have worse accidents. Chasing these side issues distracts from addressing the real problem. Climate change is a technical problem to be solved by technology that produces less carbon dioxide. It is also a cultural problem. People have to choose to pay more for their energy and reduce their personal consumption now, in return for reducing harm to other people in the future. That is a hard sell. Saying someone else should pay makes you no different than a climate change denier. You just have different excuses. A Symbiotic Relationship that Ruins Everything The book begins with Naomi Klein bravely attending a Heartland Institute conference on climate change. Such a gathering of conservatives dedicated to free market solutions would seem a rather hostile environment. But why would they welcome such a well known opponent? Because she tells them, \u201cWhen climate deniers claim that global warming is a plot to redistribute wealth, it is because they are paying attention.\u201d She represents exactly how they want to portray the entire environmental movement. And in turn, they represent the heartless extreme capitalism she wants to depict. Truly we have a symbiotic relationship here. A believer in conspiracy theories might claim that Exxon and the Koch Brothers funded this book. It better supports their goal of polarizing the public than any number of conferences they can organize. With the goal of hijacking the climate change issue to push her collectivist fantasy, it could be one of the most destructive books ever written. If this book changes anything, it will be to delay real action to address climate change. I suggest you read George Marshall\u2019s Don't Even Think About It: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Ignore Climate Change for a hard look at addressing climate change. It may help you see why this book ruins everything. ...more At every stage our actions are marked by a lack of respect for the powers we are unleashing \u2013 a certainty, or at least a hope, that the nature we have turned to garbage, and the people we have treated like garbage, will not come back to haunt us This book is a brick, a great heavy block with which you can shatter screens of lies and greenwash.

Nine months after reading it, I still remember parts of it so well that I'm reviewing without properly rereading, so please accept my apologies for my bodgy job (and hold the jokes about gestation please), but I will reread at some point not just to refresh my memory but as therapy for burn out and political despair. It starts off with the bad news \u2013 so devastatingly sad I sobbed for all of us everywhere, humans and non-humans, all but doomed to a future of environmental devastation, so much so that a stranger (but fellow northener) gave up her seat on the tube for me 'you look like you need this more than I do, love'. The next day I was chuckling under my breath and punching the air with a suppressed 'Yes!' for the victories of Blockadia and PEOPLE POWER generally against extractivist corporations and their scary supporters in state power. The keystone idea here is that the simple reason we're failing to do what we need to do and stop burning the damn fossil fuels already is that the things we need to do are in fundamental conflict with deregulated capitalism. I am in 100% agreement with this. We have the technology, we have the knowledge, we have the desire and wherewithall to help each other out, make sacrifices, work together and all that, we just have this bonkers system that is wired to kill us all. The fact that an elite minority currently has a stranglehold on the world economy is, in Klein's view, just really really bad timing. If climate scientists had got in a decade earlier, we'd be fixed up good by now, and if the whole ozone layer thing had been a little bit later, when governments can get sued for banning dangerous products, we'd probably be hiding behind specially coated windows and only going out at night. Witness the UK's current PM unbanning bee-killing neonicotinoids this year. Activists are working overtime on stuff like this because it gets harder and harder to win through legal channels while corporate forces crunch ahead tearing down regulatory structures designed to protect people from their depredations. Klein describes the past quarter-century for the corporate globalisation process as 'zooming from victory to victory' But this is just from the intro, Klein goes deep and wide, crafting a thorough, unsparing philosophically rich analysis of the ideology of extractivism (which is associated with rightist groups now, but has an appalling history of support on the left too) and its effects, studded with illuminating case studies (like the island of Nauru). Colonialism is an extractivist ideology and practice \u2013 a response to the climate crisis must centre decolonisation. Klein explores the 'magical thinking' of bad solutions. These include the 'merger of big business and Big Green' when environmentalist groups attempt to 'translate [our arguments] into profits, earnings, productivity, and economic incentives for industry'. Some supposedly environmental protection groups even had their own fossil fuel contracts as well as being funded by Shell, BP et al and investing their funds in such companies. This links to the greenwash around fracking, billed as a 'bridge' to cleaner energy, which is pure bullshit \u2013 let it be cried from the rooftops please - renewables are now efficient and affordable enough to supply all the world's energy needs and all new investment in energy infrastructure needs to be put into installing them. Carbon credits get slammed here too, obviously. Next up on the block are 'messiahs' like Richard Branson, who made a great song and dance about going green and throwing money behind green tech after watching that film by Al Gore. But he didn't actually do anything, just throw a bit of money at lower-emission aircraft fuel development and carry on as before. Carrying on as before just isn't going to be an option. This links into the geoengineering strand, which is the scariest thing ever. Klein calls it 'our culture's most powerful form of magical thinking'. The main idea discussed is that of dimming the sun with particulate emissions of some kind, so that the earth can cool down a bit while we... carry on burning fossil fuels. The two really obvious arguments against this are that then solar power wouldn't work (Klein points out the huge environmental racism of the idea \u2013 solar is going to be the biggest power source for the global south) and that it's impossible to test the effects of such an intervention in an extremely complex system-of-systems that we don't understand very well. Of course, we could try to predict the effects, but since we can't predict the weather for more than a week into the future with any accuracy........? Klein also points out that geoengineering is always 'plan b' but we haven't actually tried plan a \u2013 just stop burning fossil fuels. There's also an insightful critique of the 'astronaut's eye view' concept of saving the planet. The earth as a fragile blue ball we have to care for like a needy child. Actually, it's we who are fragile. She urges us to look at Earth not from outer space but from the roots and soil. The hopeful leg of the book centres the residents-as-custodian perspective associated with indigenous people's beliefs and practices: love will save this place she says, people will stand up for the soil and water that nourishes them. The successes of blockadia, community movements to take local control of power generation (in Germany for instance), the wave of divestments under pressure from ordinary folks and so on speak to the potential of people power to win this, to force governments to do their job and protect people from unbridled capitalism instead of spurring it along. Put simply, fossil fuel companies have said that they will extract and burn five times more resource than scientists say the atmsphere can possibly take, then they are intent on suicide genocide ecocide on a total scale, and if we don't stop them, we and all our descendants are all dead. One of my favourite parts of the book, 'The Right to Regenerate' presents a profound insight Klein had, which she came to through the new sensitivities and concerns that her painful struggle to become pregnant had brought to her. Reflecting on a day she spent on a boat in the Mississippi River Delta with people from an organisation dedicated to repairing the damage done to the wetlands by a major BP oil spill (she strongly suspected the exposure to chemicals at the time caused a miscarriage), she recalls that the guide was most concerned about something much harder to observe than the fouled water and the oil-streaked fish and vegetation; the vulnerability of all the eggs and larvae and other juvenile aquatic life, defenseless against the toxins, that normally spawns in the wetlands before populating the oceans and shores: crab, oysters, shrimp, tuna, swordfish, mackerel, marlin are among these species, and a whole generation of them would almost certainly be lost to the spill. 'I had the feeling we were suspended not in water but in amniotic fluid, immersed in a massive multispecies miscarriage' she shares. She extends this thought to humans; drugs and chemicals are approved for safe use and exposure based on their effects on adults: 'more than three-quarters of the mass-produced chemicals in the United States have never been tested for their impacts on fetuses or children'. She goes on to discuss environmental racism in relation to fertility and children, as well as attacks on women's reproductive autonomy and lack of support for mothers in the US and Canada. Finally she writes about agroecology so movingly that I was fired with passion to become a farmer. This chapter in particular highlights the salience of decolonising feminist perspectives in climate movements. Klein demonstrates in her own writing the shift required by coloniser peoples towards forms of knowledge drawn from emotional, personal sources, that comprehend human lives as part(s) of a whole. What is making headway in the struggle to save people from climate change is, unsurprisingly, grassroots movement, much of it led by indigenous activists and people in 'sacrifice zones'. Klein emphasises that racism has always directed much extractivist activity, that native people and other people of colour who have seen their environment violated have always protested and attempted to stand up to polluters, and that the main reason rich & powerful white folks are now all of a sudden interested in restoring broken treaties that guarantee rights to fish in such and such a river to such and such a band or nation is that climate change is making an impact even on their back yards now. She also warns aganst treating indigenous people and their non-extractivist relationships to nature as another resource to be mined. Colonists have always been liars, and in leveraging the rights that native peoples have not had to power to get enforced could be a kind of restorative justice, but there shouldn't be cookies for the simple act of keeping your word, let alone hundreds of years late. This reminded me of Onora O'Neill's concept of rights rooted in obligations \u2013 what obligations are created by the rights of indigenous people? What are the full implications of 'honouring the treaties'? Settlers will have to go further, Klein says, than raising money for legal battles: 'they will have to become the treaty and land-sharing partners that their ancestors failed to be.' Linking back to an interview with an indigenous man employed on the tar sands, who said he had to tell himself it was the Moon, not the Earth, to keep going, but was unable to find other work, she points out The only people who will be truly empowered to say no to dirty development over the long term are people who see real, hopeful alternatives. Again, cllimate change is political. After discussing 'the power of keeping our word' Klein turns to 'the power of paying our debts' \u2013 how rich nations must help others to improve the lives of their populations through green development, not through burning fossil fuels. And by 'help', what's meant here is meaningful economic assistance. Aid paid for by taxpayers isn't the source Klein has in mind, rather, the corporations extracting from poor countries and funnelling the riches to global elites should pay up, governments should stop subsidising fossil fuels (for real, I mean, why the hell is that happening?!) and pay for tech transfer instead and so on. In short, battling climate change means & needs reparations, liberations, decolonisations, and all their implications. ...more Pretty good but very long.

Environmental solutions have been prevented, but not by what I thought. I figured it was people's general lack of awareness, or nonchalance, or procrastination, or avoidance. Something like that. But it's nothing like that. Regardless of what the news agencies report, most people worldwide are aware of the environment impact problems and want solutions to them. The solutions have not come (and are not coming) from most governments and definitely not from big business because the politicians and capitalists don't want their profits and sleek way of life interrupted. There is also a prevailing view among the world's wealthy that poor people and people of color are expendable, that our lives do not matter. Reading this book changed my life in some surprising ways. (1) I no longer donate money to environmental groups just because they claim to support the cause. I found out, in fact, that almost all of the environmental groups own stock in the very oil/gas/coal companies that they claim to oppose. One of these groups has even drilled its own oil wells! (2) I no longer believe that recycling, water conservation and changing my light bulbs are solutions to anything. We've been told to do these things to ensure our complacency by making us feel that we are doing our part to help the environment. I continue to recycle, conserve water and turn off the lights, not because these things will solve any problems but because they are the right things to do. These activities alone will make no difference in the overall outcome. The solutions lie in the development of non-extractive sources of renewable power. (3) I joined Idle No More. (4) I moved even further to the left and I didn't think there was any more room over there. (5) I'm writing this review to persuade you to read this exceptionally important book and come to your own conclusions. ...more This is not the treatise against capitalism that some people have made it out to be, or that I was hoping for. I'm honestly pretty torn on what I think about it.

I'm honestly pretty torn on what I think about it. On the one hand, Klein's focus on direct action is both necessary and inspiring, and I think this is an important step in challenging liberals to step outside their ineffective comfort zone of signing petitions, writing the occasional check to a green org, and calling their absolutely useless representatives who will never, ever listen to them. On the other hand, I was disappointed that despite the title, she doesn't dig deep enough on the subject of capitalism. She makes a lot of really, really great points, but falls short of arriving at the conclusions that logically stem from those points. I think she actually might be doing some damage by dancing carefully around the subject of capitalism. By referring to it constantly as \"deregulated capitalism\", she has actually given people the false sense that capitalism itself is not the problem. She lays waste to major parts of capitalist theory then gives those who aren't open-minded enough to really question capitalism an escape route. After reading a number of reviews in which people flat out say that she shows that \"capitalism itself isn't the problem, we just need to regulate it\", it's painfully clear that her treatment of capitalism was too soft and that the right message isn't getting through to people. For starters, this is less focused on capitalism and more on the human desire to conquer nature as opposed to learning to live in harmony with nature, which is all well and good, but I felt like she repeated this point way too much. In close to 500 pages of writing, she manages to frequently rephrase the same points while failing to expand on others that are very important. For example, she spends a whopping 2 paragraphs each on the food system and militarism, even though they represent a large portion of overall emissions and are huge climate-linked problems we need to tackle. Her points on these subjects were very compelling and I got really excited when she got to them, only to be disappointed when she quickly moved on to something else. It would also be nice if she at least touched on the subject of resource depletion. I know that it is considered a separate topic from climate change, but it shouldn't be. Both climate change and resource depletion are the result of a constantly growing, profit-driven economic system that knows no bounds. If the goal of the book is to present evidence that capitalism is incompatible with stopping climate change (I'm beginning to wonder if that really was her goal here), why not put one more giant nail in the coffin? I personally think it's an extremely compelling argument that even in the absence of climate change, capitalism is driving us off an ecological cliff. Anyone who cares about the environment, or the fate of the human race for that matter, should also care that we are putting huge reserves of natural resources at risk of disappearing. There will be no clean energy if we use up all the nonrenewable metals to manufacture ipads and killer drones, or if we wait until oil is even harder and more expensive to extract to build out renewables. That's a very powerful, irrefutable point that she easily could have made. Furthermore, given the title, I was expecting a more detailed argument against capitalism and more discussion of possible economic alternatives. Klein does an absolutely great job of illustrating how some of the big green organizations betrayed their own goals by getting into bed with the fossil fuel industry. That is perhaps the most important points she makes. In doing so, she hits on a critical point regarding the corrupting nature of profit-driven markets. She does a fantastic job of explaining how the profit motive is failing us. However, she stops short of reaching the conclusion that if the profit motive doesn't produce what's best for society, if it actually produces a lot of things that hurt us, then we need to move away from it. It would have made sense at this point to discuss cooperatively owned and managed businesses, cooperative networks/markets, or participatory democracy/economics. It would have made sense to discuss ANY alternatives to capitalism at this point, but she didn't. I can't tell if this was a choice on her part to be soft on the issue of capitalism for fear of pushing people too hard, or if Klein herself still hasn't overcome her own cognitive dissonance. After all, how else can a person discuss how growth is killing us and how the profit motive only leads to greed without calling for a different system that doesn't center on those things? Taxing polluters and regulating emissions, while an important step in the right direction, is not a solution to these particular problems. Actually, the more I think about it, the more confused I am by her conclusions. She demonstrates how destructive capitalism is, both environmentally and socially (she even discusses the colonial nature of capitalism), but doesn't seem to go beyond the typical liberal solutions of taxing and regulating. She calls for radical, direct action to demand a transition away from fossil fuels, but not for labor organizing to demand any of the economic changes that she says we need (but doesn't really talk about). I was surprised that in a book that confronts capitalism and calls for a \"Green New Deal\" there was no discussion at all about the labor organizing and strikes that brought us the first New Deal. I think this was a glaring omission. Another very important point Klein makes is that decentralized, local clean power networks are a necessary part of the solution that will be fought tooth and nail by profit-seeking utility companies because such systems aren't profitable for them. The type of decentralized system she proposes, with public ownership and oversight, is actually the basis of what a new economy might look like, but again, she stops short of making this connection. She even asserts the need for economic planning (which is what has so many conservatives all riled up), but without getting into more detail on how this might be accomplished in an equitable, truly democratic way, she is likely scaring off a lot of people by giving the impression that we should trust our completely corrupt leaders to make those decisions for us. In general, I feel like all her references to a new economic paradigm are too vague. She could have easily made these connections, between decentralized systems and democratic management, and pointed people toward a real way forward, but instead, she leaves us with one vague notion after another. I didn't expect her to delve deeply into any particular economic solutions (there are already entire books dedicated to the subject), but she should have at least mentioned some. People are getting tired of hearing that we need change without presenting specific ideas of what that might entail. And without specific examples of what it might look like, promoting economic planning sounds an awful lot like central planning, which scares people for good reason. I get the impression that Klein herself has only begun to realize the systemic problems of capitalism and may have written this book before she was adequately prepared to do so. Even after describing one way after another in which the market fails us, Klein falls right back into the market fallacies by saying things like this: \"It's true that the market is great at generating technological innovation...\" No, that's not \"true\" at all. It's a belief. It's not a fact. And I expect someone who does research-based writing to know the difference. While she goes on to talk about how the market also drives a lot of terrible behavior, there is no need to walk on eggshells like this. She needs to stop pretending the market is a tool that can be wielded for good, because all the evidence in the world suggests it's not. Plenty of the evidence she herself presents flies in the face of this completely unsubstantiated, ideological claim. I think she has a long way to go with her own understanding of what capitalism is and the difference between regulating it and changing the rules to create something totally new. Given that her main audience seems to be liberal environmentalists who aren't open-minded enough or brave enough to really question capitalism, I think this book could serve a useful purpose. Most people are completely brainwashed into believing that capitalism is some law of nature or god that we dare not question and I give her a lot of credit for taking on such a controversial topic. Religious-like beliefs like that are hard to chip away at. People don't drastically change strong, ideological views over night and they need steps along the way. Hopefully, this provides a big step in the right direction for those people. Overall, she makes some really great points, pokes some giant holes in capitalist theory (whether she or her readers realize it or not), and offers a somewhat radical and very hopeful outlook on a subject that usually leaves people feeling utter despair. For that, I think she deserves a lot of credit. But for those who have already overcome those ideological barriers, there's nothing new here. The only exception is her discussion of Blockadia, but even that is just the latest in a long, global history of resistance movements that employ direct action. That part of the book at least left me hopeful. If someone with the reach of Naomi Klein can make an effective call for direct action and disobedience, maybe (hopefully) we will finally reach the critical mass needed to start turning things around. ...more I'm a big Naomi Klein fan and I consider myself an environmentalist so I was quite excited to read Klein's new book on climate change. I was worried that it would be depressing -- I don't know about you but with the passing of each day and nothing being done about climate change I get more and more resigned to the fact that the planet is doomed. Frankly I don't understand why it's not a bigger deal to everyone in the world. We should all be alarmed, but instead our heads our buried in the collec I'm a big Naomi Klein fan and I consider myself an environmentalist so I was quite excited to read Klein's new book on climate change. I was worried that it would be depressing -- I don't know about you but with the passing of each day and nothing being done about climate change I get more and more resigned to the fact that the planet is doomed. Frankly I don't understand why it's not a bigger deal to everyone in the world. We should all be alarmed, but instead our heads our buried in the collective sand. Perhaps that's because we may be past the point of doing anything as a species to save the planet from its man-made demise. Here's what NASA's Dr. James Hansen has to say about our situation: \u201cIf humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted, paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO2 will need to be reduced from [current levels] to at most 350 ppm.\u201d Dr. James Hansen Right now we\u2019re at 400 ppm, and we\u2019re adding 2 ppm of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere every year. Unless we are able to rapidly turn that around and return to below 350 ppm this century, we risk triggering tipping points and irreversible impacts that could send climate change spinning truly beyond our control. This is not hyperbole. It's not a theory. It's not up for debate. It's science and the odds are against us. Klein's hypothesis seems to be, and I am oversimplifying it, is that only a mass social movement like what we saw in the 1960s on equal rights or during the 1800s like we saw to end slavery will we be able to move the needle to avert this crisis. In fact, she argues that our entire way of life -- our capitalist society -- will need to change in order for us to turn things around. She may be right. For as long as extractionists continue to make obscene amounts of money from fossil fuels and control the political will of nations we will be fighting a losing battle. Yep. Klein's book was depressing as hell. As she outlines all of the things that are wrong with our systems (political, social and otherwise) it becomes harder and harder to imagine humankind has the will or the desire to stand up to the status quo. Sure, she points out plenty of isolated cases of people rising up to stop pipelines or mining operations around the world. She calls this \"blockadia\" and suggests this is the start of a worldwide movement to fight for the planet. She makes a compelling case that the world's indigenous peoples will possibly lead this fight because they are perhaps the most threatened by climate change and extraction. She tried to be optimistic about the future, but frankly she doesn't convince me that anything will change on a massive scale, the kind it will take to keep us from raising global temperatures beyond the 2 degree barrier that so many scientists believe will mark the tipping point. She argues as well that what we do as individuals (like recycling and using canvas bags at the grocery store) is not enough, that we need a movement to energize the masses. But Katrina didn't do it. Superstorm Sandy didn't do it. Drought hasn't done it. What will it take for the 99 percent to stand up to the thieves who are extracting us into extinction? At one point her argument made me feel like we were all in some warped Hunger Games society, but there is no Katniss Everdeen to save us from the bad guys. Who will lead us to victory? Fredd Krupp? Robert Redford? Leonardo Dicaprio? I agree with Klein's premise, that we need a Marshall Plan for the planet and our economic system is designed to propagate the problems. I just don't see how we'll drag people away from the Kardashians to do anything about it. Yes, I'm a pessimist. But I haven't seen anything to show me otherwise. I'm not even sure what I can do about it. I am a good steward of my own environment, but it's not enough. And there's no global movement to join. Am I supposed to blow up fracking equipment and sabotage oil wells? I have a family -- I can't go to jail. I guess I'll continue to stand by and wait for someone, anyone, to lead us out of this mess. ...more Indianizing [Through my ratings, reviews and edits I'm providing intellectual property and labor to Amazon.com Inc., listed on Nasdaq, which fully owns Goodreads.com and in 2013 posted revenues for $74 billion and $274 million profits.

Sloppy, shallow book, whose intellectual shortcomings are topped by the celebrity-style vanity of sharing worldwide an alleged existential crisis (as the Guardian's Owen Jones puts it), brought about by maternity. Having outsourced research to two assistants (see Acknowledgements), the author does not really make an argument, but usefully reviews a number of environmental and anti-environmental movements, leaving it to the readers to wrap up. Which I'm always happy to do. What is climate action's greatest risk? As climate deniers aptly and presciently grasped, it is the inevitable shift from a centralized and hierarchical economic model based on fossil fuels to a distributed and flatter one based on renewables, which we can call 'indianized'. This shift will be matched by a more equitable distribution of income and rights. All the interests vested in the current (centralized and hierarchical) model oppose the shift (geoengineers and green billionaires stand out for originality). To accelerate the transition, struggles are required, possibly modeled after indigenous peoples' decade-long campaigns. Where the book is weakest is in its inability to distinguish between struggle and struggle, both contemporary and historical. The author's analysis of the abolitionist and civil rights movements is inaccurate and simplistic. The haste with which she blesses the divestment movement born on the most exclusive US campuses, worrisome. Clearly, now a mom, the author has decided that class is no longer an issue. Moral sentiments can replace it, and all our problems are just a matter of ethics succumbing to greed. But capitalism is a class machine, by definition, from the outset. As the author points out, based on the work of promising scholar Andreas Malm, capitalism is a production system whose aim is to constantly gain the upper hand on nature and workers through technology and technocracy for its functioning and development. The author however does not draw any conclusion from this consideration, preferring to contemplate the moving beauty of (classless) 'people' joining forces against greedy corporations (classless too in their capacity as self-directed drones) to protect Naomi Klein's children and grandchildren's planet. Effective climate action is probably based on taking, unlike Naomi Klein, an a-moral stance towards fossil fuel capitalism, which now can be simply understood as the root cause for dangerous climate change and as such has to be discarded. It is a technically focused, organizational restructuring, to be carried out in cold blood (as David in 2001: A Space Odyssey discards the dangerous HAL 9000 and super-humanly moves on). The resulting indianized economy can be a prosperous one. We need books that think through the indianization of our energy, financial and industrial systems, leaving to climate deniers to deal with the emotions of an elitist loss. ...more This Changes Everything is one of those books which has been discussed so thoroughly I feel as though I can add little to it. So I'll keep my remarks to be even more brief than usual. The main question which Klein leaves unanswered is how much the individual will have to reduce their consumption of energy.

I've never read a non-fiction book outside from school (apart from biographies) before and especially not one that was this big. But it went really well, and even though it took me a really long time to finish it (by my standards), I'm so glad that I read it. This is exactly what the title suggests, a book about the conflict between the climate and capitalism, and why we as a society must come together and form a new economic system that does not depend on exploiting the nature and other human beings. I will say that I already believed the main thesis that Naomi Klein puts out which obviously affected my reading experience. I'm active in the green party in my country, Sweden and I study sustainable devolopment so I knew a lot going into this. But still, there was so many different topics in this book that I haven't thought about before especially when it comes to the economy itself. You know, even though I am an enviromentalist, I always kind of felt stupid in some ways because every time a I discuss certain enviromental problems with people they always respond \"yeah, I get it, but what about the economy?\" and I never really knew how to answer because I couldn't really see any other realistic economical models. Well to put it the clich\u00e9 way: this book changed everything. I am a person that questions everything. I don't see things as black and white or right and wrong. But I started to realize while reading this book: I question every single thing around me except for the economical system that I live in even though I know that it is horrible from my point of view. I wanted a different world but I just couldn't see how that would be possible. Well, it might have been my education and my low age but I was seriously so stupid because let's face it, capitalism as we see it today has only existed since the 80's. Humans have polluted the earth for around 200 years but the current system isn't exactly ancient and that was one of the most important things that this book made me realize. We can and we must change it. Naomi Klein has a way of putting a bit to much info and not enough discussion in my opinion. I prefered when she discussed a topic on several pages than those were she just \"info dumped\" statistics. It's necessary to know a lot before forming an opinion and she certainly is convincing but sometimes I found that to be a bit boring. But apart from that this book was wonderful and so important. I think this is the kind of book that everyone should read given that you know some basic information about climate change itself before. If you're kind of unsure if you believe it or not, I would recommend reading or watching (there's some really good and simple documentaires out there to watch) something else first. But if you do know about, read this book no matter of your political believes. I think everyone can gain something even though you don't agree on everything. The book itself does not really deserve five stars but I do not rate my books on quality, I rate them on feeling and how much they impacted me. My heart is so weak when it comes to both climate change itself but also the amazing and powerful fight that is going on against it. I am 18 years old and I live in Sweden, one of the world's most privilage country when it comes to a future affected by climate change, both geographically, politically and economically. I will obviously be affected but not nearly as much as other people in this world. But I do care, I care so much that it hurts. I don't want to live in a world where people are dying in floods, heats, famines and drought. But I also don't want to see a future where my children won't play in the snow as I did when I was a kid. I think that's why I am so emotional when it comes to the fights against it. I'm not kidding, I was seriously crying throughout the third section of this book which is about the movement against climate change. This book gave me guilt, fear for the future but also hope and it was exactly what my personal activism needed. It brings up the questions society doesn't allow us to ask and things media doesn't show us. It's so extremely important because climate change will in one way or another affect us all and I we do not act soon, it could kill millions of people and some of the things that we value the most. This book is a part of a new movement, the movement that can actually change everything and hopefully create a better future for all of us. ...more The book could also be titled \"This Changes Nothing,\" because only .1% of humans alive today have the native intelligence to understand why the issue of anthropogenic global climate disruption is a matter of life and death not only for humans but also for the myriad species who are our fellow travelers on planet Earth.

The accomplishment of profound societal change, if sought peacefully, also demands a set of linguistic and psychological frames revolutionaries can use to inform, impassion, and ultimately persuade people to join the cause of converting aspirations into economic and political realities. Additionally, successful movements require hard data and concrete policy directives to substantiate their claims. Naomi Klein\u2019s <+++>This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate</+++> provides all of these for the climate movement, and will perhaps be remembered as one of the most important framing documents of a generation. This Changes Everything is both an eloquent explication of the pressing challenges of 21st century environmentalism as well as a rousing polemic against the forces that are driving us toward the edge of the climate cliff. Klein\u2019s unapologetic moral clarity deftly circumvents a media environment stifled by cowardly attempts to feign objectivity. Rather than trying to sugarcoat her arguments so they can be easily digested by the status quo, Klein goes out of her way to emphasize that her strategy for addressing the climate problem will fly directly in the face of today\u2019s dominant economic trends. This could be a wildly depressing book. Indeed, The Shock Doctrine was one of the most depressing works of nonfiction I\u2019ve read. But This Changes Everything is a resoundingly hopeful document. Klein\u2019s central message is that fixing climate change requires radical solutions that, if implemented, will not only mitigate the damage we are doing to the biosphere, but also begin to put right the most egregious sins of capitalism and globalization: \u201cThe fight against violent resource extraction and the fight for greater community control, democracy, and sovereignty are two sides of the same coin\u201d (309, emphasis hers). This insight\u2013\u2013that beating climate change is as much about fighting for a better world as it is about avoiding the possibility of a much harsher one\u2013\u2013imbues Klein\u2019s book with an infectious, ebullient energy that sways skepticism and dispels indifference. Klein starts out by explaining the global community\u2019s collective failure to properly address climate change up to this point. Regarding climate change denial from the political right, she makes the nuanced case that conservatives actually understand better than anyone that climate change is anathema to their way of doing business, both in politics and the private sector. Conservatives must either accept radical change or deny the impetus for action: \u201cThey have come to understand that as soon as they admit that climate change is real, they will lose the central ideological battle of our time\u2013\u2013whether we need to plan and manage our societies to reflect our goals and values, or whether that task can be left to the magic of the market\u201d (40). Klein also exposes the failures of the left, especially the \u201cBig Green\u201d movement which has by and large teamed up with oil companies and abandoned the fight for meaningful carbon reforms. Many liberals have also been guilty of toothless activism by ascribing to the illusion that we can beat climate change by simply growing vegetables, driving hybrid cars and switching out a few light bulbs. Klein pulls no punches: to bring about lasting, truly sustainable change, we will all have to significantly reduce personal as well as industrial consumption. Klein is unequivocal in her assertion that incremental responses to climate change are no longer viable; given how long we\u2019ve ignored the problem, we don\u2019t have any non-radical solutions left on the table. Laying out her plan for action, Klein sets her sights on 2 degrees celsius\u2013\u2013the current rise in global temperature within which climate scientists say we have a good chance of avoiding the worst case scenarios. Some claim we are already committed to a 4-6 degree increase, but Klein thinks 2 degrees is still manageable if we act fast and forcefully. Meeting this challenge will require actual and radical change resulting from the combined actions of individual communities and national governments willing to intervene in markets and dictate the terms not just of a swift transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewables, but of a just transition where the rights of the globe\u2019s most vulnerable lifeforms (human and otherwise) are taken into account. Governments, for their part, must get over the false truism that markets are best left alone and that corporations cannot be forced to pay through the nose for polluting. We cannot allow our fates to be decided by billionaire philanthropists and geoengineers toying with ecological systems they don\u2019t fully understand, so the only other option is to harness political structures in order to appropriate and redistribute the vast wealth accumulated by corporations and individuals, especially those most responsible for carbon emissions: \u201cIt is not that \u2018we\u2019 are broke or that we lack options. It is that our political class is utterly unwilling to go where the money is (unless it\u2019s for a campaign contribution), and the corporate class is dead set against paying its fair share\u2026[we] need to demand (and create) political leadership that is not only committed to making polluters pay for a climate-ready public sphere, but willing to revive two lost arts: long-term public planning, and saying no to powerful corporations\u201d (119). This is not just idle talk\u2013\u2013Klein provides plenty of data showing how the money for a global transition toward renewables for everyone (not just the first world) can be collected and put to good use. Her plan is also not an elimination of free markets, but merely a recognition that some activities and resources are too important not to be tightly regulated and made transparent for public scrutiny. All we need is the political will to get it done. No small feat, but also not a particularly high price to pay for simultaneously saving and improving our civilization. While communities are pushing for this political paradigm shift, they will also have to fight tooth and nail to resist the further extraction of fossil fuels, sometimes against overwhelming odds. Since further extraction is tantamount to giving up entirely on the 2 degree target, banding together to fight extraction wherever it arises is the most important work to be done by people living wherever oil or coal can be found. One encouraging example is the \u201cHonor the Treaties\u201d movement, which involves a resurgent assertion of the rights of sovereign indigenous North American nations that has provided the foundation for a particularly potent rejection of the Alberta tar sands and Keystone XL pipeline projects. This is just one of many creative strategies Klein documents to reveal how communities can keep carbon in the earth. The climate crisis, for all its horrors, can also provide the motivation and resources to knit disparate activist groups together in common cause. This Changes Everything can be read as a political and ideological companion to the work of Jeremy Rifkin and others who see capitalism as an economic system that will ultimately bring about its own marginalization. Rifkin\u2019s recent book The Zero Marginal Cost Society provides the technological and economic platform on which many of Klein\u2019s suggestions can be put to good use. Readers looking to participate in radically new economic systems that put a premium on human capital and environmental flourishing\u2013\u2013what Rifkin calls \u201cthe biosphere lifestyle\u201d\u2013\u2013are well advised to look to his works for further guidance. Klein\u2019s passionate manifesto climaxes with her championing of the biosphere\u2019s \"right to regenerate.\" This poignant and heartfelt chapter describes Klein\u2019s battle with her own reproductive system, and draws parallels between her personal struggle to become pregnant and the hurdles faced by myriad lifeforms that are currently running up against reproductive failure due to compromised ecosystems. \u201cAs our boat rocked in that terrible place\u2026\u201d she writes of witnessing the aftermath of the BP Deepwater Horizon spill, \u201cI had the distinct feeling that we were suspended not in water but in amniotic fluid, immersed in a massive multi-species miscarriage. When I learned that I too was in the early stages of creating an ill-fated embryo, I started to think of that time in the marsh as my miscarriage inside a miscarriage\u201d (427). Very rarely do journalists draw such effective connections between depictions of disaster and relevant personal hardships; Klein\u2019s metaphorical resonance and professional fearlessness are superb. Klein goes on to argue that saving ourselves and our world from catastrophe requires a sweeping new view: \u201cA new kind of reproductive rights movement, one fighting not only for the reproductive rights of women, but for the reproductive rights of the planet as a whole\u2026All of life has the right to renew, regenerate, and heal itself\u201d (443). This regenerative perspective excoriates the miasmic anthropocentrism that still passes for good sense in halls of human power. It is a call to arms for those willing to sacrifice and strive to achieve a more sustainable, relational lifestyle for this and future generations. Throughout this book, I tried my utmost to be skeptical, to seek out holes in Klein\u2019s arguments and research. And while this is neither a foolproof reform plan nor a work of groundbreaking intellectual creativity, it is one of the most meaningful and courageous pieces of writing I\u2019ve ever had the good fortune to come upon. Any quibbles I have with Klein are just drops in a sea of appreciation for the fact that writers like her are willing to do that which I am too cowardly to accomplish myself: record stories from the darkest caverns of human activity and use them to map a way back to the light. Failing to achieve a just transition away from environmental exploitation and into a better, healthier world would be a travesty in itself, but all the more so when we have books like this to help us figure out how to play our part. So, in whatever way you can, get started. \u201cThe stakes are simply too high, and time too short, to settle for anything less\u201d (466).

I feel we are living in apocalyptic times and witnessing the slow death of our civilisation. Naomi is a brave woman who states her case eloquently but I fear that her message is unheeded by the vast majority. It's clear that there is a connection between Denial or climate change and Privilege. You only have to read some of the insane ramblings on this website by the likes of Adam and The Paladin. Fucking morons. These \"Cool dudes\" are anything but cool. They are basically the new Klan. But they don't hate niggers. They hate anyone that threatens their way of life. Arrogant pricks. Basically it boils down to Free trade v the environment. NADTA and the WTO have caused huge increases in emissions this century. Developing countries providing cheap labour for multinationals to exploit. The mantra of economic growth. There was an Interesting article in the Guardian about this topic on 9 April. If anyone cares. I keep asking myself the same question: why would 97% of scientists come to the wrong conclusion? Why are you Mr B cleverer than them? You aren't. You just don't like the truth. Like a naughty child. Now Grow Up. Face the consequences of our collective actions. Otherwise you can go to hell. Assholes who won't clear up their own shit. Klein is Spot on. Welcome to the 1%. Those of us that have nothing but contempt for humanity. It feels good to read many of the reviews here. Anyone that gives this less than 4 stars is not serious about it. The future is Green. Or there is no future. Stop voting for the establishment. Which is everyone except the Greens. And if voting fails Protest until the fuckers listen. Actually most of my vitriol is directed at the Apathetic electorate rather than the Big Money that runs this joint. If we all stopped voting for their shabby political elite things might just might change. But No. The fucking idiots keep voting for the same clapped out shit. There are plenty of people writing about climate change. Try reading some of them. Mark Dowie. Tim Jackson. Kevin Anderson. Caroline Lucas. It's not just Klein. Notice that Klein is not advocating state controlled energy companies as in the past - but an alternative vision of local community owned cooperatives which has been successful in Germany - the most radical nation in Europe. The irony of that given its recent history - or perhaps because of that history - is something that rankles with this Brit. Why are we lagging behind? Because we want out of Europe and would rather hang onto the coat tails of the USA. Ridiculous. The energy companies reserve replacement ratio means that in order for shareholders to keep investing the fossil fuel companies must continue to exploit the earths reserves. Madness. Sheer madness. Indefensible. Criminal. We are fucked. The stark truth. We cannot allow the fuel companies to extract even 20% of the reserves currently held. Or the planet will cook. No wonder these same companies find the climate change denial movement. But not only are the climate change deniers funded by polluters but it's clear that many of the big environmental groups have been corrupted by corporate interests. As Klein points out its hard to say which is the most naive. Trading in pollution points the finger squarely at the Clinton administration. Indeed it's already pretty clear that successive U.S. Governments have been the enemy of conservation. Surprise surprise. Later on the author makes reference to the documentary \"Gasland\" which should be essential viewing for all those with an interest in opposing the current status quo. The frontline of the battle to come. I Predict A Riot. The Revolution will not be televised. The Apocalypse is looming. Green or Dead. As the radical rock band MC5 once proclaimed \"You are either part of the Problem or part of the Solution\" You must choose before it's too late. I'm sorry I couldn't give this one 5 stars. But maybe that's a reflection of my own depression this morning. ...more A sickening collection of lies about the science of climate change and non-solutions to the crisis Klein claims.

There's also no mention of the 18-year lack of any global warming, measured on the ground and by balloons and satellites. At last count, there are more than 50 explanations of the \"pause\", the \"hiatus\" revealed more than a year ago in the NYT. Klein claims she researched this topic, but doesn't mention the NYT admission of no warming. Klein has no scientific credentials; she doesn't even have any journalistic cred (she almost finished an undergrad journalism degree). Every crazy claim by the alarmists is in this rambling mess, including the sad story of Nauru - the island whose inhabitants destroyed it for the sake of mining guano. Somehow, in Klein's fevered mind, this is the fault of CO2 emissions? Klein claims to fear that her young son - to whom the book is dedicated - will never see a moose, never see a starfish, destroyed by climate change. Never a word about the 4 million children who die annually of pulmonary disease, because their mothers cook indoors over open fires of wood and dung. Poverty and early death are worse than the phony climate change crisis Klein is milking. Klein's greed and hypocrisy make Al Gore look like Mother Teresa. Klein is right about one thing: in a capitalist economy, some people will do anything for a buck. Klein is already married to a millionaire; she has thousands from previous books. She needed this schlock? Like her knowledge of atmospheric science, that's about as deep as her knowledge of economics goes. Page after page contains the disgusting phrase\"climate denier\" or \"climate denialist\", adapted by Gore from \"Holocaust Denier.\" Coming from Klein, it's ironic, to say the least. Quite remarkable: a book about a \"crisis\" that doesn't exist and that offers no solution. BTW, I'm a meteorologist with a specialization in radiative transfer; I understand the \"greenhouse effect\" quite well. The heating response to CO2 is logarithmic - rises sharply, then levels off to an asymptotic value. We're long past the \"knee of the curve.\" That's why there's no \"crisis.\"Adding additional CO2 has no additional heating effect.And, no, I don't work for the Koch family. I can't imagine what prompted the high ratings others have awarded to this propaganda - other than ideology. ...more Klein is the current master of political journalism (some would call muckraking) exposing the misery behind the logos on our foreign made clothes or tracing the electroshock and bullet holes that we used to build this monolith of capitalism.

She skewers all the false idols and hopes we could rely on to fight this oncoming threat like natural gas, population control, geoengineering , green billionaires and other false and foolish hopes. The idea that we can prevent the worst effects of this without fundamentally altering our entire way of life is an illusion and she makes this case thoroughly. I find her way to optimistic but hope she is right. We will look back at this book in the coming years with either praise or an infuriating frustration at what we could of done, how we could have ended up. I do wish a less divisive character had written this book as more people need to read it, but I can\u2019t think of anyone better suited to the task. ...more Someone told me Naomi Klein's new book would make me see climate change in a totally different way. I didn't believe it - but it's true. It's terrifying, thrilling and inspiring - and it's the most important book about politics to be published since... well, since Naomi Klein's last book. http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/Ber... Are We Screwed? 17 February 2016 As I was reading the first part of this book, trawling through countless numbers of examples of how the fossil fuel industry is raping and pillaging our Earth, how our political leaders are in their pockets, and how were are constantly being bombarded with propaganda as to how climate change is really nothing to worry about while the true effects are being hidden behind beautiful pictures much like the slums of Dehli where during the Commonwealth Games, I simply c Are We Screwed? 17 February 2016 As I was reading the first part of this book, trawling through countless numbers of examples of how the fossil fuel industry is raping and pillaging our Earth, how our political leaders are in their pockets, and how were are constantly being bombarded with propaganda as to how climate change is really nothing to worry about while the true effects are being hidden behind beautiful pictures much like the slums of Dehli where during the Commonwealth Games, I simply couldn't help thinking about how we as a species are heading down a path that not only will end up destroying the planet, but also destroying that which we hold dear while ceding ever more power to the aristocrats that currently rule the planet. I guess a part of me was used to what I had read in Klein's two previous books No Logo and The Shock Doctrine where she basically tells us how bad things are yet offers no solutions that I expected that this book, with the enormity of the crisis that we are facing, would once again end with a completely hopeless note. However this is not the case, particularly since we are talking about our future here. Simply by taking the strategy that Klein used previously would result in us giving up and basically eating and drinking because we might as well have fun now if the climate change is going to have such an impact upon our world that everything that we have managed to build for ourself is inevitably going to be destroyed. Instead Klein actually ends on a message of hope, dedicating half of the book to revealing how former enemies have united against a common foe and how mass movements are developing to push back against the corporate interests that currently dominate our thinking. Mind you, there is still a pervasive belief amongst society that climate change first of all is somebody else's problem, or that it is rubbish (such as my uncle's statement that 'Climate Change is crap' without actually providing me with any evidence to support that view). The scary thing is not so much the climate change deniers but rather those who are basically apathetic towards the situation, those who accept that something must be done, but leave it to somebody else to solve the problem, or even believe the corporate propaganda that suggests that they are doing something, but not demanding any proof that anything is being done. Personally I have encountered numerous climate change deniers in my time that simply make the statement 'climate change is crap' with the belief that that simple statement invalidates any argument that I might raise to the contrary. Mind you these people tend to resort to logical fallacies to support their arguments, or even just raise their voices to drown out any opposition simply because they are incapable of mounting any rational argument to the contrary. However when I confront such people I try to steer away from climate change per se and put the argument in perspective by point out the real costs of our out of control industrialised society such as the destruction of the natural environment: the fact that in many places around the world our air is becoming toxic: while our water systems are becoming undrinkable: [image error] It was interesting to note that as I perused the responses to this book that there where quite a few positive reactions from readers, and one who had slammed it as another part of the left wing conspiracy to take his money and his freedom (which attracted a lot of harsh criticism). At first it seemed like Goodreads is full of people who actually care about the environment and desire to see a better world that isn't ruled by corporate interests, however I then realised that this is social media, and that when I jumped over to Atlas Shrugged I discovered that there was just as many positive responses to that book. The thing with social media is that you can pretty much filter out anything that you don't like so that the only things that you see are those that reinforce your worldview. I still remember when I first became aware of the crisis that our modern uncontrolled capitalist society is creating. A friend of mine handed me a little booklet about the World Trade Organisation and suddenly my right wing individualist worldview was changed forever. Yet I have to admit that despite the fact that I don't own a car, and don't live a life where I am endlessly consuming, I know I could do much better. The reason I don't own a car has more to do with the fact that it is cheaper to use public transport (and the public transport in Melbourne is pretty good), and while I may not cycle through commodities as fast as humanly possible (while cluttering my house with useless stuff, though I am probably going to need to get a new phone since my current one is now over three years old and basically reaching the end of its life span), I still buy tea in takeaway containers (and maybe a coffee) and shop at the major supermarkets. Yet I also see some positives happening as well. Okay, while people are putting ever more solar panels on the roof, when the current Liberal (conservative) government was elected they began to systematically cripple the renewable energy industry in favour of their mates in the coal industry. However while the fossil fuel industry was enjoying bumper profits for the past twenty odd years everything changed suddenly as the price of oil and iron ore completely collapsed. All of a suddenly it isn't profitable to look for new sources of oil, yet the companies that are on the verge of bankruptcy are forced to continue pumping as they simply cannot afford to shut down any wells, which is further exacerbating the collapse. This suddenly changes the picture as cost intensive extraction methods become less appealing, but untapped reserves are suddenly left in the ground (which means that some oil baron is unlikely to come along and start fraking your backyard). Mind you, everything that I said is probably invalid because I do own shares in a gold mine and an energy company (though the energy company did purchase some windfarms so they could say \u201chey, look at us, we care about the environment, we own a wind farm!\u201d). Anyway I think I will leave it at this, however if you are interested in reading more I have written a post on the subject on my blog. ...more A lot of other reviews I've seen have been accusing Naomi Klein of being a crazy Marxist against western civilization or something, as if that's even a possible combination. My views are much more radical than hers (in my opinion anything resembling a large-scale green socialist system should only be seen as a temporary stage on the way \"back\" to bioregionalism and the use of democratic technics) so I think those criticisms are completely ridiculous.

My views are much more radical than hers (in my opinion anything resembling a large-scale green socialist system should only be seen as a temporary stage on the way \"back\" to bioregionalism and the use of democratic technics) so I think those criticisms are completely ridiculous. What she's advocating doesn't even appear to be totally socialist and she's definitely not anti-civ, although she does seem to have a hint of that sentiment. It's kind of a strange analysis actually. From the title I was expecting her to lay out some sort of proposal for a totally new system. The vast majority of the book is just a cathartic denunciation of the fossil fuel industry. Bashing these industries is fine but if environmentalists insist on constantly putting out 500 page books they need to get beyond the clever rewordings of the same things we've already heard a million times. It's nice that progressives are slowly headed in the right direction, challenging economic growth, fighting for a revival of the commons, localized production, redistribution of wealth and land, agroecological food production, etc. But they're stuck on this green city model of sustainability that has no chance of ever being sustainable. Even when acknowledging things like planned obsolescence and how much less production is really necessary to have the same standard of living if things are designed to last they still use the green jobs argument to push their ideas. It should be obvious that cutting working hours and production is the way to go but politically no mainstream group can handle that. Even when acknowledging the basic income idea (free money, potentially enough to survive on, to every adult whether they work or not) progressives still get sucked into the competition with the right-wing about which direction will give us more work to do. It's just inconsistent logic. And one of the things she says over and over is that our inability to solve the climate issue is due to \"bad timing\", as if this all would have worked out if it happened earlier, when corporations had less power, or later, when corporations had gotten all possible profits from fossil energy and they decided to go green themselves because it was just an economic necessity. Yet she knows that growth imperatives are the problem and she admits that they've been with us even before capitalism. So clearly she knows it's not just a bad coincidence of timing. It just feels like she was afraid of saying anything unpopular with her fan club. After 500 pages I still don't really get what she's promoting besides the typical solar panel and wind turbine run high-tech modern middle-class fantasy world. I don't want to create the impression that this book is terrible. A lot of people will benefit from reading it. It's just disappointing that she's still sticking with such a mainstream vision of the future when she seemed so close to actually getting it. We need more people to be honest about how far from sustainable we really are. ...more Once upon a time, there were all sorts of people writing antiglobalization books, but now it's just Naomi Klein, Naomi Klein, Naomi Klein. Go into any bookstore, from Los Angeles to Lahore, and odds are that she'll be dominating that shelf. Anyone else is lucky to get a look in. And if you complain, they just shrug their shoulders. Logic of the market, you know? Well, I think it's a crying shame. Someone ought to do something about it. In 2008, Newt Gingrich and Nancy Pelosi did a tv spot together pledging to combat climate change. Can anyone explain to me what the heck has caused this Republican insanity? Is there a single candidate from the Grand Ol' Party who even believes in it any more? And why not? Our brains tend to filter new information to protect our belief system.

Can anyone explain to me what the heck has caused this Republican insanity? Is there a single candidate from the Grand Ol' Party who even believes in it any more? And why not? Our brains tend to filter new information to protect our belief system. The groups fighting climate change are not science groups. They are right wing organizations like ALEC, the Cato Institute, the Ayn Rand Institute, the Chamber of Commerce, the Heritage Foundation, the Heartland Institute. Obviously, they are getting the funds from the energy companies. \"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.\"--Upton Sinclair. At the Heartland Institute, they recommended finding shade or buying an air conditioner. The Chamber of Commerce said \"populations can acclimatize to warmer climates via a range of behavioral, physiological, and technological applications.\" Boycott stores that support the Chamber of Commerce. Starbucks and Chipotle worry about losing key ingredients due to climate change. Others warn of the billions of dollars it will cost us to deal with rising sea levels alone. The insurance lobby has been the corporate sector most worried about climate change, for good reason. Instead of pushing for better climate change policy, they contribute to the change denier groups like the Heritage Foundation and the Heartland Institute. So while Heartland spoke against climate change, it also worked to protect the insurance industry's bottom line. So they pushed Congress for policies that would protect them, no matter what the weather. They used such \"free market\" measures as raising rates and deductibles and dropping customers from high-risk areas. What madness! In 1966, 40% of college freshmen thought making money was very important. By 2013, that figure reached 82 %. The same logic that cuts pensions, food stamps, Headstart, and health care before raising taxes on the rich would blast the last ounce of gas and oil out of the earth before changing. The \"Free Trade\" movement played a part. The World Trade Organization ruled against many local companies. A \"free market\" is nonsense anyway. Fossil fuel companies receive $775 billion to $1 trillion annually in global subsidies. Three pillars of the neoliberal age are incompatible with solving our climate problems: 1. privatization of the public sphere, 2. deregulation of the corporate sector, and 3. lowering of income and corporate taxes and the expense of public spending. We knew about the climate change problem for a while. LBJ received a report from his science advisers. But it wasn't until the great James Hansen from NASA in 1988 spoke to Congress did it make any impact with anyone. Globalization aided carbon emissions. China was responsible for most of the increases. Some say we must fight free trade to solve the problem. Multinationals could scour the globe for the cheapest and most exploitable labor. This led to massive infrastructure projects. Dams, highways, ports, coal plants. A free market dream and a climate nightmare. Environmental groups were convinced to support NAFTA. That left only labor groups to convince. The errors in the agreement could not then be corrected. Let's hope the same thing does not happen with TPP. It is too late to undo the old errors, but we do not have to redo the same errors. What we need to understand is that the climate crisis cannot be solved without rocking the economic boat. Consuming less is important, but how do we get everyone to do that unless we change the rules? It can't be just for those care because there aren't enough of us. We need to return to the 1970s, not the Stone Age. Here is what is required : tough regulations, visionary long-term planning, higher levels of taxation for the affluent, large public sector expenditure, reversals of privatization. The privatization issue is difficult to oppose in the US. A 2009 study claimed about 45,000 people died in the US because of no health insurance. I agree with the author that we need universal healthcare. Opponents continue to act as if it were un-American. Centralized energy from one source can be knocked out in one blow: natural disaster or terrorism. Climate disasters are increasing at a very rapid rate. And public funding is decreasing at a very rapid rate. Fossil fuel companies have known for decades that their products are warming the planet. They failed to adapt to that reality. The US military may be the single biggest consumer of petroleum in the world. Jimmy Carter tried to make conservation an act of patriotism. Reagan, to his eternal disgrace, turned that around. Conservatism my ass. The tar sands in Canada, of the Keystone Pipeline fame, is three to four times as intensive as normal oil extraction. The investments companies make in oil extraction means they must keep on working for decades before they recoup their money. The oil and gas industry spent 400,000 dollars a DAY lobbying Congress and other governmental officials. Legal bribery. And they made 73 million in campaign donations in the 2012 election. Socialist and communist nations have been just as bad with environmental degradation. The island of Nauru was once successful as a model place to live. Then miners dug for phosphate for fertilizers. The island was dug up deliberately to be destroyed. The same thing is happening on a greater scale with the planet. Coal absorbs uranium, cadmium, and mercury. When it is burned, it releases that to the world. The golden age of environmental laws was the early 70s. Now, the \"conservative\" movement is trying their best to destroy them. And by the way, the results of those laws worked many wonders such as cleaning up the air in LA. The change came with Ronald Reagan who said, \"A tree is a tree. How many more do you need to look at?\" Why is he admired so much? The green groups could have joined a coalition of unions, civil rights groups, and pensioners fighting against deregulation and cutbacks. Their failure to do that cost the planet. Market based solutions were promoted over regulatory ones. The result was disaster. Chapter 7 is called \"No Messiahs.\" Billionaires like Richard Branson made promises but did not deliver. Chapter 8 deals with efforts to come up with a plan B like dimming the sun. If the end is near, we may just do that. Unfortunately, it will not likely work. As William James said, \"Our science is a drop, ignorance a sea.\" In one study, it showed that Africa would get even less rain with such efforts. The solution is plan A: Don't fix the world, fix us. Conservatives would rather regulate the sun than Exxon Mobile. It is we humans who are vulnerable. The earth will go on. Life may end, but the planet will last a while. \"Sacrifice zones\" are needed to run the economy. The humans there are categorized as \"less than human.\" It's usually a combination of race, class, and language. As Rick Santorum said, however, \"Drill everywhere.\" Well that philosophy has made some new enemies. Suddenly, ranchers and suburbanites are becoming environmentalists. Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson quietly opposed fracking in his neighborhood because it would \"lower property values.\" Welcome to the club, Rex. That may have been a strategic error. Earthquakes are now happening in oil areas. And, of course, climate change affects us all. Government cutbacks in Canada lost a few thousand scientists their jobs. All in the name of tar sands. In the US, we had the Halliburton loophole with George W. Bush. Compare the following two quotes for attitudes: Rachel Carson in 1964: \"I believe that the more clearly we can focus our attention on the wonders and realities of the universe about us, the less taste we shall have for destruction.\" Jason Bostic, Vice President of West Virginia Coal Association, 2011: \"What good is a mountain just to have a mountain.\" And here's another: Labor organizer Mary Harris \"Mother\" Jones in 1925: \"There is never peace in West Virginia because there is never justice.\" But we keep plugging on in what appears to me to be a losing battle against scientific ignorance. ...more A Revolta do Planeta \"Sabemos que se prosseguirmos no caminho atual de permitirmos que as emiss\u00f5es de carbono aumentem de ano para ano, as altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas ir\u00e3o mudar tudo no nosso mundo.
