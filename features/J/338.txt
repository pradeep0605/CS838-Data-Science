I bought this for my dad as well. He also loved it. Favorite quotes: Although my parents never attended church or mentioned Jesus except when they screamed at each other\u2014and then they used his full name, 'Jesus Fucking Christ'. I am prone to envy. It is one of my three default emotions, the others being greed and rage. I have also experienced compassion and generosity, but only fleetingly and usually while drunk, so I have little memory. The thing is, I worship John Updike...I would drink his bathwater. He tossed his head slightly, in such a way as to cause his hair to sweep back. This made me feel actual pain, so extreme was my hair envy. Now maybe I'm just ultrajudgmental, but I really feel that only two groups of people have any business collecting dolls: little girls and grown women who lost all their children in fiery car accidents. Other than these two exceptions, doll collecting is just plain creepy. For someone like me, somebody who has large vacant holes where character should be... Touring a client's factory was akin to spending the afternoon with the parents of the world's ugliest baby and being forced to endure eight hours of home movies. I remained quiet for a moment because i could not risk opening my mouth and having 'Now listen here you stupid motherfucker' come out. There's probably not a connection, but when I started drinking again, my apartment wandered back into squalor. I, with my salad bar of insecurities... Now, I found myself having third, fourth, fifth dates with people i didn't care for. Even people that i loathed and wished would get caught in a grinding, malfunctioning escalator. There is a little German in me, therefore I don't do cuddly. Be excited when you encounter cosmetic surgery mistakes. Be excited when a birth defects marathon runs on The Discovery Channel. But don't be excited because you had some coffee. When you insult the Midwest\u2014land of corndogs, casseroles, and all my favorite packaged food products\u2014you insult me. Give me down.

She was incredibly funny, but in a way that made you say, 'That's horrible,' before you laughed until you accidentally farted. As with most things from childhood, I eventually outgrew my love for McDonald's and my desire to be an Afro-American. I adjusted to my own life as a standard-issue white male alcoholic. But perhaps my gay gene, the gene responsible for my desire to own platform shoes at an early age, somehow mutated because of my mother's heavy hairspray use. If a green body-builder with acromegaly or a geriatric dwarf who lived in a hollow tree didn't sing, dance, or otherwise celebrate the product, I didn't want it on my plate.

If I am in an exceptionally great mood - happy, well-fed, just had a great conversation or meal with a friend - I think his stories are hilarious. I laugh out loud and grin. \"Oh, Augusten,\" I think, shaking my head in amazement. \"You're so funny!\" But if it's any other time - then I see Augusten Burroughs as a man who has suffered through a lot of pain. And I think his stories are a reflection of that. RE-READ 03/09/2014 I think my reaction to Augusten Burroughs's short stories is based on my mood. If I am in an exceptionally great mood - happy, well-fed, just had a great conversation or meal with a friend - I think his stories are hilarious. I laugh out loud and grin. \"Oh, Augusten,\" I think, shaking my head in amazement. \"You're so funny!\" But if it's any other time - then I see Augusten Burroughs as a man who has suffered through a lot of pain. And I think his stories are a reflection of that. The truth is a mixture of both. Burroughs is a wonderful writer. He has an uncanny way of guiding you through a story so that you end up just where he wants you to be. Sometimes that's not at all the place you thought you'd end up when the story started out. To reiterate: Burroughs had the childhood from hell. (<---B>Read a review of RUNNING WITH SCISSORS</---B>). And I believe that this childhood turned him into a selfish, very damaged person who is only able to see other people are selfish and damaged. This makes him mean. And of course, it's funny. It's very funny to read someone make mean, truthful observations about life - things that you yourself would never think or say...but you can't exactly fault his reasoning either. But the reason I find this less than enjoyable most of the time is because it makes me sad that he thinks humans are so...well, not exactly evil, but only out for themselves - selfish and ruthless in equal parts. When I finish a book by him, I can shake off this gloomy worldview and return to my normal, cheerful self. But I know that he can't. Some of these stories are about his childhood, some are about his job at the ad agency, some are about being a writer, some are about dogs. There's at least 3 dog stories in this book. Some are about his long alcoholic period. The best story in the book, by far, is KITTY, KITTY about a time when a severely alcoholic Burroughs buys a Wheaton terrier from a puppy mill pet store. He names it KittyKitty. His descriptions of the idiot dog and how it acted were truly hilarious. I laughed so hard tears came to my eyes. Someone heard me laughing como una loca (like a madwoman) and asked me what was so funny. So I handed her the book and said \"Read this story.\" She did, and when she brought the book back, she said, \"That was so sad.\" What? That wasn't the reaction I had - or the reaction I expected her to have. But she was looking at it from a different perspective - Burroughs is a drunk in this story who's life is falling apart. He's in no position to care for a dog - and at the end of the story, (view spoiler) [ he gives up the dog for adoption because he knows he's not doing right by the animal (hide spoiler) ] Same story, but we had totally different reactions. You could interpret the whole book this way. You could just choose to focus on the funny part of a story - the part of the story that makes you laugh because Burroughs is hilarious and he wants you to laugh. Or, you could focus on this constant dark undertone that's in every single thing he writes. I'M DAMAGED!, he screams. Pain bleeds from the pages and it really does make your heart hurt when it all sinks in. SAMPLE: (from Kitty, Kitty) I named him KittyKitty. Because he looked like a kitty. But twice the size. And he was so gentle and sweet that for the first two weeks I thought he might be mildly retarded. His kind brown eyes were always half-closed and he licked my hand, even after I pulled it away. His little tongue just continued lick, lick, licking the air. It was endearing, but also a little pathetic. Yet I knew I'd made a good purchase because he was almost no trouble at all, like a potted cactus. He made less noise than my answering machine, and housebreaking was easy because my floor was already covered with magazines and foreign newspapers, which I couldn't read and only bought because I was pretentious. But by the third week KittyKitty became alarmingly energized, as if awakened from a long, deep hibernation. When he wasn't barking at the exact frequency that causes windows to shake, he was leaping from the sofa to the floor to the chair and then running full speed down the hall to the front door, sliding into it and knocking the jackets hung on it to the floor. ...more I enjoyed Running With Scissors as much as anyone else who enjoys a read that makes your family look significantly less fucked up, so I decided that I'd give Possible Side Effects a shot.

I don't doubt there are freaks out there who would want this kind of memorabilia, but our author seems to be a little too proud of it for me to like him. In fairness, perhaps if I had read \"Running with Scissors\" first, I would have fallen in love with him and then would be amused by these glimpses into the mind of the author. Stories further into the book pick up a little for me, but I'm not sure if it's because they were truly more entertaining and better written, or if it's because I felt nostalgic for the places Augusten described, since I went to college in Western Mass. I agree with another reviewer on the point that Augusten's attempts at sentimentality seemed phony and overdone, especially in the story about the badly burned dermatologist. Puh-leeze.

Whether it is a new genre or not, Augusten Burroughs' writing falls squarely in this realm. \"Possible Side Effects\" is a collection of hilarious but also often sad essays on Burroughs' life both past and present. His delivery will keep you laughing out loud but the pathos that lies beneath most of his writing will, at times, have you concerned for his safety. In a lot of ways, Burroughs' reminds be of his fellow gay humorist, David Sedaris but, as hard as this may be to believe, I think Sedaris is more comfortable in his own skin. There is a dangerous edge to most of the writing in \"Possible Side Effects\" that makes it as powerful, thought provoking and compelling as it is funny. I really can't say enough good things about this book. When I finished it, I had to resist the urge to simply turn back to the beginning and start again. ...more Turns out I'm not a fan.

He would have had an excuse, I suppose, if he were totally ignorant of the sad reality behind pet store dogs, but no, he\u2019s more than well-informed: I did know that you\u2019re never supposed to buy a puppy from a pet store. And the reason is that you support the puppy mill industry. A puppy mill is a disreputable breeder who churns out puppies the way Nabisco churns out Oreos. Often the dogs are inbred and have health problems. But all of this knowledge evaporated once I went inside the pet store and saw the adorable puppies. He continues: A rational person would have seen the filthy cages where the dogs were kept and known better than to slap down his credit card and take one home. But I saw the filthy cages and thought, I must save one. I found myself cursing the puppy mill industry who play upon the dogs\u2019 plight as a selling point and use their suffering to appeal to sympathetic shoppers. The author doesn\u2019t get off the hook, either, though: \u201cSaving\u201d a pet store puppy by buying him is a pointless endeavor, as he\u2019ll only be replaced by another suffering puppy, and so on as long as the cash register keeps ringing. And he knows that. That\u2019s the maddening part. KittyKitty turns out to be too overwhelming for Augusten (that\u2019s another feature of irresponsible pet shops: they don\u2019t assess a customer\u2019s ability to care for an animal, only pay for him). With a heavy heart, the author takes him to an animal shelter. Happily for KittyKitty, he is adopted into a much more stable home belonging to a shelter employee. However, I found myself mourning for KittyKitty\u2019s parents, still trapped at the puppy mill. One would think after this disastrous experience, Burroughs would swear off buying dogs. But no! The chapter titled \u201cThe Sacred Cow\u201d has he and his partner purchasing a tiny French bulldog puppy at another pet store. And while \u201cCow\u2019s\u201d life is much more secure than KittyKitty\u2019s, once again, the miserable cycle of puppy mill breeding continues. Come on, Augusten. You have a big heart. If you really want to \u201csave\u201d a dog, you need to head down to your animal shelter. ...more Augusten Burroughs is a fantastic writer.

Some of the stories, like the masterful Kitty, Kitty, are both hysterical and heartbreaking (there's great symbolism in this story). But a lot of them are abrupt, random and uninteresting. They feel like the sorts of jokes that are building over time to a fantastic punchline, but then the joke teller forgets the punchline and the joke falls flat. A lot of the stories meander from one story or topic to another without completing either bit. Even at his most disappointing, Augusten Burroughs is a talented writer and always worth the couple of hours and $15 tops that it costs to read one of his books. While I wanted to love Possible Side Effects I came away liking it enough. At very least it's engaging and you get some wonderful reoccurrences of favorite characters from other memoirs (Pighead! <3, Augusten's mother!, Assburger!) and a few new gems (both Grandmothers!).

Unfortunately, this memoir did not give me the same entertainment and shock value that made me appreciate Burroughs in the first place. Possible Side Effects is a collection of short stories ranging from his quirky childhood to his messy adulthood. What turned me away from this book is the lack of organization and connection in his stories. It became somewhat difficult for the readers to indicate which part of his life is being described because of the fact that his stories are all over the place. He would tell a story from his quirky childhood about his crazy poet of a mother and then suddenly follow it up with a story about the time when he was an alcoholic. It seems like he used this method to show some sort of correlation between his unconventional upbringing and the issues in his adult life. However, it only ended up being confusing and flat because of the lack of that \"wow\" factor from the readers. Some stories just ended up being disappointing because there seemed to be no point in writing and publishing them in the first place. It is pretty evident that I was a little disappointed when I finished this book. I delved into it with such high expectations because of the high bar Running with Scissors set. I know it is a little unfair for me to compare the two books as they are different in content and style, but it is quite unavoidable when some parts of the book were parallel with each other. It seemed like he recycled some stories from his previous memoirs and stuck them together in this book. ...more In \"Running With Scissors\", I flat out didn't believe Burroughs.

There is nothing wrong with someone writing a memoir and stretching the truth, but I couldn't shake the feeling that he was flat out lying. Along with his horrifyingly vivid description of his early teen sexual experience with a 30 year old man, I felt like he was trying to hard to be shocking for the sake of being shocking. I enjoyed his style, but I had a hard time respecting him. In \"Possible Side Effects\", it seemed that Burroughs didn't try to force things. He has stories that don't rely on overly fantastic situations. He leans upon his writing instead of the situations he puts himself in and I think the book benefitted greatly for it. I made the mistake of reading \"GWF seeks same\" during my Latin class. My instructer was at the board translating sentences as I tried my damndest to supress giggles in the back of the class. It was definitely the best essay in the book in my opinion. \"PSE\" reads fast. If you didn't like \"RWS\", don't give up on the Burroughs. \"Possible Side Effects\" isn't a great book, but I definitely liked it. I hear that \"Magical Thinking\" is his best book yet, so that'll be the next one I try. ...more I read the book Possible Side Effects by Augusten Burroughs. I think his purpose for writing this book was to entertain. He writes a series of stories about his past to teach lessons, and to entertain readers. He writes a lot about his adventures with his anxiety about his cardiac problems, and much more. Readers can explain that Augusten is not meaning to be funny with his life situations, but ends up being hilarious.

Readers can explain that Augusten is not meaning to be funny with his life situations, but ends up being hilarious. From collecting college t-shirts to nicotine gum, this story is endless humor. The theme in this book isn\u2019t that hard to find. Augustens trying to make readers realize we are all clumsy sometimes, and those situations can always turn out to be life lessons. It also seems as if there is no theme. There are many different stories and each one of them have their own lesson. Augusten seems to find humor in the little things, in his chapter about his cardiac issues, he wrote- \u201cAnd with these words, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re supposed to be aware of your own heartbeat- this unknown woman in a burnt orange poncho doomed me to a life of pathological overawareness of my own cardiac activity (86).\u201d He has humor to the littlest things. The style of this book is narrative, with many stories about the life in Augusten Burroughs. This book is very entertaining and I enjoyed every bit of it. I would rate this book five stars, because of the humor and the relatable situations. ...more Sad, narcissistic, alcoholic stories. I can't remember why I wanted to read this book. To me it seems like Burroughs's agent said \"hey, man, enough time has gone by since we last published a book, you should do another one\" and Burroughs complied with a series of essays that are...unremarkable, so far: little blog posts of short memoirs, to which there seems to be no theme and no purpose, just the certainty that the author has a big enough name and a big enough following that people will buy wha Sad, narcissistic, alcoholic stories.

So far, seven essays in, it is not. Moving beyond the first group, we get into a series of essays that remind me of every addict I've ever known, and how people with addictions always think they are so charming and so funny and so entertaining, when really, they're just self-centered, and boring in that self-centered ness because they're just like every other addict trying to convince themselves they are charming, funny, and entertaining. Clearly there's a big market for \"addiction lit\", but I'm had enough of the genre in real life, and find little patience for it in literature. The two stars is because the writing isn't terrible. ...more Possible Side Effects shows us more than anything that Burroughs is living a happy, successful life. While still haunted by demons from his perilous childhood, he has conquered many of them, and the rest he lives with. I find it hard to not be happy that Burroughs has reached this pinnacle in his life. He certainly deserves it. However, it's not as interesting to read about his happy life with his partner Dennis or his success as an author as it is to read about him living with his mom's shrink Possible Side Effects shows us more than anything that Burroughs is living a happy, successful life.

However, it's not as interesting to read about his happy life with his partner Dennis or his success as an author as it is to read about him living with his mom's shrink or going through rehab. This book had a sort of Dress Your Family In Corduroy and Denim feel for me. As I felt about the recent Sedaris novel, Side Effects is similar to Burroughs' earlier works, but lacking some of that hilarious edge that hooked us in the first place. I would recommend the book if you are simply curious about what's been going on with Augusten Burroughs, or if you want a light no-hassle read for a few days. ...more I really enjoyed this book! I have read other books by Augusten Burroughs, and I think my familiarity with his troubled family and all of his eccentricities made the book slightly more appealing than if I had gone in blind. The essays remind me of a more low-brow David Sedaris , which I mean as a compliment to both authors. Burroughs doesn't necessarily leave you with a moral to the story like Sedaris does. Some of these stories (especially the one about adopting his dog, CowCow) had me stifling I really enjoyed this book!

I definitely found myself chuckling out loud a couple times. I was expecting this book to be a little darker, perhaps because I remember his other book Running with Scissors having some darker aspects to it, but it's really pretty light for the most part.

I am ashamed to admit that I had never read Augusten Burroughs before taking this out. I didn't want to start with \"Running With Scissors\" because I dislike reading books after I've already seen the film adaptation... This was a great intro. Big ups, Augusten. Perfect blend of snarkiness, wit, and self-awareness to draw me in. I did end up taking out Running with Scissors after all. Wow. Hysterical and sad all at once. Thank you Augusten for sharing all of your layers, sparing us nothing! Once again, you have not disappointed! It's a scream. Not many books can make me snort-laugh out loud and break my heart at the same time. This is why I love Augusten Burroughs. He's definitely not for everyone, but I love him. There are some very sad stories in this book. I liked it even better than Running With Scissors.<---C>Augusten Burroughs</---C>", "Title": "Possible Side Effects"},
