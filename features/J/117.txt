Tibby - I was pretty disappointed in Tibby, and while it's realistic that she wouldn't have changed overnight after the events of book 1, I just was annoyed with her storyline 90% of the time. Lena - I seriously cannot deal with the insta-love going on with her story. She was literally in love with someone who'd said all of 5 words to her. <---C>Bridget</---C> - I loved Bridget's story the most in this book. It had the most meaning,<---M> but unfortunately</---M>, there are parts to her story that were so laughable to me that it undermined the depth. I don't know, I just want more showing to back up all the telling. At least, in my experience I remain unconvinced of a lot of what the girls are going through. Carmen is the only character who I feel any connection with because she is always so emotionally charged. I feel like I really know why she feels how she does and see her raw reactions. There is so much potential in Tibby and Bridget's stories and while I'm told 'this is a sad thing' over and over, I'm not really seeing them reacting. We spend so little time in each character's POV before it switches to the next girl that I feel like I'm only getting to know them on a surface level despite the very important topics the book is trying to get at. I listened to this on audio and the POV switches were terrible in that format because they ran together. I do want to point out that there are a lot of dated attitudes in this series (lack of body positivity, and use of the 'r' word in casual insults are examples from this book), so this could be something some readers won't enjoy. But I grew up in the same years these characters did and the books are a product of that time period (early 2000s). ...more I wasn't terribly impressed with the first book, but I was interested enough in the characters to want to read more. I am so glad I did! This book seemed more realistically teenaged-girl, both the good and bad. The girls had to face things in their lives that they could avoid as children, and came out stronger. Though other people criticized the way that Bee changed, I thought it was actually a pretty accurate depiction of a girl hurt by her early sexual experience.

Though other people criticized the way that Bee changed, I thought it was actually a pretty accurate depiction of a girl hurt by her early sexual experience. Teenagers experiment with their appearance and stereotype all the time, and Bee did not have a family to try to steer her course. For whatever reason this book just touched me in a way that the first one didn't. I like book series that age with their audience, and I think this one has really managed to do that. ...more Third Read: August 22-27, 2016 Second Read: May 2009 Original Read: March 2004 My re-read of the series continues...<---F> this time on audio book</---F>.

All so I can *finally* read the final book in the series, Sisterhood Everlasting . I found that I was annoyed by most of the girls (with the exception of Bridget) all through this second book in the series. Carmen - Carmen behaved like an abominable brat for 90% of the book. Her reaction to her mother daring to date and basically have a life made me want to smack her. I understand it had just been her and her mother since her parents divorced, but come on. Carmen was almost 17 years old and would be leaving for college in a year anyway. But Christina had the audacity to date and find some happiness and that sent Carmen into a tailspin and behaving like a selfish child having a tantrum. She was thoroughly unlikable for most of the book. Tibby - I've always liked Tibby but her choices in this book had me so disappointed. She spent her time and efforts trying to gain the favor of two \"cool kids\" whose favorite past time was mocking others. And in the process she was thoughtless and cruel to Brian - and her mother - hurting them both. Shame on you, Tibby. Lena - Lena's pining over Kostos was annoying since it was she that broke things off. And then she's devastated to learn that he went out with a girl? Uh, you broke up with him. Was he supposed to magically understand why and then pine after you till the end of time? The events with Kostos at the end of the book did have me completely sympathetic toward their plight but all the angst leading up to that point smacked of melodrama. (And the thing with Paul? I had totally forgot about that since my last read!) Bridget - Bridget was the only one who seemed to be making smarter decisions this time around and growing in the process. I loved reading about her summer with Greta. Not my favorite book in the series but I'm still looking forward to continuing my reread of the series. ...more Yes, <---A>Ann Brashares</---A> does it again! Who knew the second book could be as good as the first? You'd think the plot wouldn't work as well, with Tibby so close to home, and Lena and Carmen not going away. But somehow, it still worked. Yes, the girls saw each other a lot more often. But they still talked online, or sent little postcards to each other. They still made it seem they were apart, even when they were five minutes away. And those conversations are what I really love. The letters that break up Yes, Ann Brashares does it again! Who knew the second book could be as good as the first? You'd think the plot wouldn't work as well, with Tibby so close to home, and Lena and Carmen not going away. But somehow, it still worked. Yes, the girls saw each other a lot more often. But they still talked online, or sent little postcards to each other. They still made it seem they were apart, even when they were five minutes away. And those conversations are what I really love. The letters that break up the usual writing style, the messages that show the change from different point of views. Instead of reading a book, I'm the fifth member of their little group. Well, not quite, but I really, REALLY wish I was. As with the last book, I didn't like Carmen. She's so selfish and whiny. I understand, it's upsetting for her to see her mum supposedly moving on without her. But then talk to her about it! Say you don't like that she's acting like a teenager, and you can fix the problem. The way she reacted, like a five year old, made me mad. Honestly, she's one of the biggest reasons this book doesn't get a five star rating. I could replace her in the group, then everything would be perfect! The other three girls, I absolutely adore. Bee is my favourite. In this book, she's gone a little depressed. I couldn't help but think about her mum, and worry that Bee was going to turn out like her. But I shouldn't have worried. Our Bee is far stronger than that. She didn't hide away in bed forever; she got up and flew to see her Grandma she barely knew. Because, you know, why wouldn't you? I loved seeing Bee get better over there. The character growth done there was brilliant. It was also good to find out more about her past. We knew her mum had died, we were told that in the first book. But that was really all we knew. In this book, as Bee cleaned out her Grandma's attic, we got to find out more and more. Bee started accepting the awful past her mother had had. It was heartbreaking, but necessary. Tibby grew a lot too. She was at film school, which sounded so great for her. At first, she made terrible mistakes. I mean, come on, anyone could tell that Alex and Maura were going to be lame. Plus, why would you not want to be best friends with Brian? He's so sweet, and he adores Tibby. But she learned. Through Bailey, her friend from the first book, she learned what a moron she was being. In the first book, Bailey didn't make me cry. But this time she did. Like Bee, Tibby started to actually accept her death. And that's what made it so sad. I wasn't a huge fan of Bailey, but I missed her. Tibby needed her, so then I needed her. Now all we need is for Tibby to realise that Brian is crazily in love with her, and they can both live happily ever after. Lena changed, but I'm not sure if she grew. Like Bee said, \"she used to cry about three times a year. Now she cried three times before breakfast.\" It's so unlike Lena to be so heartbroken over a boy. But she really did love him. She was probably better off without him. Having a boyfriend in Greece was never going to work out. But she didn't know that! She needed him! I'll admit, I did a little squeal of joy when they realised they loved each other. Oh, it was so cute!! But that was all the happiness Lena got. Everything went downhill from there. I won't spoil it, don't worry! But I was genuinely shocked by the Kostos plot twist. Yes, it was the right thing to do. But SERIOUSLY?!?!?!? Lena desperately needed hugs, and chocolate. I'm glad her friends were there for her. I needed friends like that there for me, just on behalf of Lena! I'll admit, I even shed a tiny tear. We got to see more of the mothers too, which I liked. Of course, I like the Sisterhood more. But it was still kind of nice to see the mothers old relationship. Plus, we got to find out more about why they aren't friends any more. And their secrets, and their love lives, and their relationships with their daughters. All very good things, that made the book even better. While this book was a little more depressing than the first one, I still loved it. How can you not love these girls? I can't wait to get my hands on book 3! ...more I love the honesty in these books - they really are something special. They tackle a variety of issues and these four girls are some of the realest and relatable ones in young adult contemporary. And you want female friendships? CHECK CHECK CHECK, this series is overflowing with women holding up other women and it's just wonderful and was really ahead of it's time and I just love it soooo much. On to reread book 3!! :D Better than the first. The ending made me angry and sad though. Poor, poor Lena. The pants are back! Here they are to give these wonderful friends the summer they have all been waiting for. I hope this book is as good as the first one! As same as in the first book of the sisterhood the author Ann Brashares uses the technique of putting for stories in 1 because each friend is living a different life, this author uses a great word choice \u201c whirlwind, hiatus, clunking, but\u2019 she doesn\u2019t use much word repetition, and I also love how she characterizes the new characters and the i The pants are back!

I am going to start with the summer of Bridget she is my favorite character. Bridget finds out that her grandma from mom\u2019s side has been writing all this past years and her father didn\u2019t tell her. She is going to visit her grandma but not directly, she is going name herself Gilda for no one to realize that she is Bridget, she used to go to Alabama all the time when she was little that is why she hides her real name. She is going to work in her grandmother\u2019s house and investigate about her mother; she is going to help Greta fix the attic. Everything comes out just they way she wanted it but her grandma realizes that she is her granddaughter and lets her stay at her house. Bridget finds herself again this summer; she starts playing soccer again and also finds friends from when she was little. Lena is another member from the sisterhood, This summer she is very depressed she misses her ex-boyfriend Kostos who she met the past summer in Greece when she went to visit her grandmother. She thinks Kostos has a girlfriend and that he has forgotten her. One day she hears the door bell, it was Kostos she didn\u2019t now why he was there. He told her that he was there for university and that made Lena more depressed because it meant that he didn\u2019t even cared for her, because he had come all the way from Greece and he didn\u2019t even called her. One night Lena went to visit Kostos; she needed to talk to him, she explained all her feelings and then Kostos said that she didn\u2019t have a girlfriend and that he still loved her. He made her very happy with those words; the bad thing is that Kostos needs to go back to Greece because of a family problem. At the end of the summer Lena goes to Greece becuase her grandfather died and she finds out that Kostos is getting married. Tibby is also a member of the sisterhood, she loves to make movies. This summer she went to a summer school of film making and she is suppose to do a movie. She makes a movie about the most embarrassing moments of her mom and after they present it she regrets it. She feels bad with her mom. But then she made a movie of the great moments she passed with her friend Bailey who died last summer, she made a great movie. Carmen didn\u2019t have a great summer she fitted with her mom a lot because her mom was dating and obsessed with David and Carmen didn\u2019t liked it. She thought her mom didn\u2019t care about her any more, she also tried to help Lena forget about Kostos but she couldn\u2019t. ...more First things first: I want the shoes that the model on the cover of this edition is wearing. Because they're wonderful and I need them. Onto the book itself - I kind of wanted to strangle all of the characters. First of all? WASH THOSE FUCKING JEANS. I'm sorry, but you cannot pass a pair of jeans between four teenage girls over the course of two summers and NOT get blood on them at some point. Also, it's summer. In Washington D.C. It's humid as shit. And Bridget plays soccer in them. WASH THE JE First things first: I want the shoes that the model on the cover of this edition is wearing.

It's humid as shit. And Bridget plays soccer in them. WASH THE JEANS. THEY'RE NASTY. But I digress. While I appreciate that the lessons that the girls learnt the previous summer wouldn't necessarily have stuck because, like, THEY'RE TEENAGERS, it would have been nice for them to not make the exact same mistakes that they made the previous year . I found myself just waving my hands in frustration at the first book, and yet no one listened to me. At this point, all I want from the series is for Tibby to get her fucking act together and realise that she should be making out with Brian because he's super sweet and adorable. But I'm guessing we get about 700 more pages of Kostas, aka the dude a 15 year old girl should never have been dating in the first place. Sigh. (Don't get me wrong, I actually didn't mind this one. But I'm fairly certain it's going to prove to be 100% forgettable in the long run. And I'm not sure if it's because it's more than a little dated now, and YA is a lot more hard hitting, or if it's just because I'm not a teenage girl and therefore relate far more to the adults in the story than the teenagers. So yeah, this one fell somewhere in the middle of the road for me.) ...more It took me much longer to get through the second book then the first. To be honest, it was painful to read most of the time. I continue to detest Carmen and her childish behavior--yes, I realize she's a teenager, but I couldn't stand to read how supposedly she was so sad to hurt people's feelings and then she'd just go ahead and do it anyway. I couldn't stand reading about Lina's heartache anymore and was especially angry when Kostos's big bomb dropped after the author FINALLY got them back toge It took me much longer to get through the second book then the first.

I thought the only real person in the book was Bee, strangely enough. The way she dyed her hair and gained weight reminded me of a time when I was a teenager and wanted to do everything possible to be the exact opposite of myself. I'm not sure I'm going to continue reading the rest of the books--the characters are NEVER happy and go on for pages and pages about their own self-woe and doubt. They spend chapters beating themselves up for their dumb mistakes and then never seem to learn from them. It might just be too much dumb girl emotion for me. ...more love this books... I wishhh..

I was hoping to like this as much as book one but it just was a bit boring and unrealistic. Just like the first book the quotes between each chapter just made no sense at all. Also the switching of POVs without notice still continued to make me confused and frustrated. Towards the end I was getting annoyed with the girls and wanted to know more about the parents. I have the next book and I'm debating on continuing or not. Hahahaha I just looked back at my review of the first book, and I had made a point to say how much I disliked the audiobook and would be sure to read the rest of the series in print. I didn't have any real issues with the narration this time, but it seemed like a sadder story than the first book so I guess the dourness of the narrator's voice worked better.

I can't say how many times I cried while listening to this as I drove home from Christmas. Each member of the Sisterhood had her own interesting, poignant story, but I felt that the mothers of the Sisterhood had a deeper part to play in this installment. I was brought to tears thinking specifically of all the ways we are cruel and unfeeling toward our mothers at various points in our lives, and how mothers patiently accept this as part of their love for their children. Ann Brashares has a way of writing female emotions and relationships that are so elegant and truthful, but she doesn't shortchange the plot for the sake of introspection. Any girl, regardless of age, should read this series. That's not to say there aren't things that frustrate you (what did Bridget THINK would happen by meeting her grandmother under an assumed identity?), but I thought this second book was particularly emotionally wonderful. ...more Rereading all 4 books this summer (after 10+ years) and reading for the first time Sisterhood Everlasting.

I kept putting off finishing this book because of how much it bored me. The characters were the same, annoying, bratty and frustrating. The plot was alright, it intrigued me a little bit more, but to be honest, I actually looked forward to reading about Carmen's mother! She was a lot more interesting than the girls! Bridget: She finds out that her grandmother has been trying to contact her and her brother Perry her via letters ever since her mother died, but her father has been hiding those letters. Angrily, Bridget decides that she is going to Alabama to see her grandmother. After her summer in California, Bridget has changed a lot. She dyed her hair brown, gained some weight, stopped playing soccer, and just hasn't been herself. In my head, I was just thinking, \"well, hello, that's the consequences of being careless,\" But in this book, actually I enjoyed Bridget a lot more. She was trying to find herself, just like all sixteen year old's do. One of the things I was annoyed with was how the author left out why her father disliked Bridget's grandmother so much. Why would he hide all those letters? Through the entire book no information was given on that topic. At the end though, it made me smile because it finally felt that she was happy again. I just hope she won't be as reckless in the third book as she was in the first. I enjoyed reading about her this time and I'm curious to know what she's going to be like in the next book. Carmen: It's hard enough on her that her father got married last summer and has a new family now, but she just can't deal with her mom having a new beau and so she sets out to destroy their relationship! First off.. My god girl, PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER! Carmen was nothing but a little selfish brat that only cared for her own self happiness. I despised how she was acting towards her mother, I despised how she treated everyone, I just despised her! Her mom was so happy about being with David, once Carmen saw that, the only thought that came to her head was, \"NO, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE HAPPY!\" And she literally tries to sabotage their relationship, in which she succeeds. I was literally so close to throwing the book out in rain because of her. If I do decide to read the third book, I do hope she's changed, because she's really starting to get on my nerves. Lena: Last summer, Lena falls deeply in love with Kostos a handsome boy in Greece. When she returns home, she decides it's best to break up with him. But this summer, she can't help but constantly think about him and want him, even though she broke up with him. Unfortunately, things start to fall apart at home and back in Greece. I was really upset to read about Lena's summer. She was sad that she didn't have Kostos in her life anymore (even though she broke it off) and then a death in the family shook her even more. I felt really bad and I just wanted to hug her. I felt like she was more interesting in the second book than in the first one. She just seemed dull in the first summer, and this time, I felt like I could see what she felt and thought. I did enjoy Lena's character this time around and I'm curious to know what her third summer will be like. Tibby: She is off to a summer film program, trying to be someone she's not while also trying to forget about Bailey's death last summer. She is assigned to make a movie about anything and she chooses to do it about her mother, but learns that it wasn't the right decision. Instead, she makes a video about someone special to her. I felt the same way about Tibby just as I did with Carmen. She was acting like a complete butt head to her family, friends, and even Brian, the guy that likes her. I was so upset with how she was treating everyone that cared for her, that sometimes I would just skip a few pages. I was also upset at how she would treat her mom and the things she thought about her family sometimes. I also hated how she treated Brian. He was nothing but nice to her and she just didn't care. She had a \"I hate the world attitude and no one cares about me,\" and to be frank, it annoyed me. Overall, if I do decide to read the next book, I do hope the characters have a drastic change to their attitudes. ...more Though this book was enjoyable to read, just like the first one, I found it pretty disappointing. I basically lost all of my respect for Lena, even though I did feel bad for her. Once and Kostos got back together, I was disappointed that all they did was make-out and all Lena wanted from him was sex. I really wanted their relationship to develop further and instead of just having sexual contact with each other, maybe they could have actually had a conversation and caught up over the past few mon Though this book was enjoyable to read, just like the first one, I found it pretty disappointing.

I really wanted their relationship to develop further and instead of just having sexual contact with each other, maybe they could have actually had a conversation and caught up over the past few months. Even though Kostos does marry someone else in the end, I felt like Lena and Kostos only had physical attraction, and I miss the relationship they had in the first book. Carmen's story was pretty much the same exact story that she had last book, but with her mom. Listen, Carmen, I get you have a bad temper and I get that you're a turbulent teenager, but seriously? Must you act like you're 3 years old? She just gets on my nerves throughout the story, I don't care how repentant she is in the end, she just comes off as bratty who feels bad about the stuff she does but does them anyway. Tibby's story was my absolute favorite in the last book because it was so full of emotion and beautiful characters and incredible lessons. And this time around, it was really, really boring. The author spent hardly any time on Tibby, and she attempted to make it deep full of life lessons, but kind of failed. It didn't even come close to the Baily/Tibby story in the first book. Now Bee's story was the best story and the only good one in the book. I really came to enjoy Bee's character and I actually wished that Bee's story was focused on more then, say, Lena's or Carmen's. Bee is definitely my favorite in this book. As for the author's writing, I just felt it was so immature and pathetic this time around. I felt like Brashares was thinking, \"Oh, well, the first book was already a success, so I don't really have to try to make this one good at all.\" I felt like Brashares had so many opportunities to make this a beautiful and touching book, but failed. There were moments when I was like, \"Oh, I liked that thought a lot,\" but they were few and in between. Brashares only talent is her knack for entertaining and realistic dialogue. Otherwise, she was lacking tremendously in descriptions and other writing skills. Loved the first book, very disappointed with the second, not too sure I'll read the next. ...more ***This review contains spoilers*** Ah, I feel in love with this book. It was a lot better than the first, and really gave us much more personal info about the girls. I was in tears several times while reading this. The movie tribute to Bailey had me crying like a baby.

I had a feeling that she knew who Bridgette was the whole time. I don't understand her father's reasoning for keeping the kids from her. Poor Lena. Finding out the love of your life is married while at your grandfather's funeral has to be one of the worst feelings ever. Kostas is a coward for not telling her. I think Tibby is my favorite character. She tries to be a hardass, but she is actually very compassionate. I'm happy she now sees that her mother truly cares for her, and is willing to make time for her as well. ...more I read this book because I liked the first one so much. Also, the teaser at the end of the first book was pretty interesting. I liked it when I finished it but thinking about it, I am a little disappointed. It seems that the major flaws that the girls had in the first book still afflict them in this one. HOWEVER, I really liked that not everyone had a perfectly happy ending. Not everyone got everything they expected and all were not smiley and hugging. This one was well-written and interesting, k I read this book because I liked the first one so much.

This one was well-written and interesting, kept me hooked but...BUT the girls were still the same, like they had learned very little from the last summer. Also, I am beginning to doubt the Pants. Seems that the first time the girls wear them, only bad stuff happens and they send the Pants on, utterly miserable. Not sure I am going to read the next one...I did request it at the library...but the teaser at the end didn't hold a whole lot of promise. ...more I liked the first one, I thought it was cute and liked that the four girls had a friendship and bond, all the while sharing a pair of you could say, magical pants. But with this one, I don't know, some of the arcs the girls were going through, I wanted to read more of or others I juts didn't care that much. I liked the ones with Brigid, a little bit of Carmen and Tibby. But Lena's I wasn't sure about. Mostly for the romance drama I was like, sigh, really.

Its still a good read and the writing too. Giving this a 3.5 at least. ...more Following the tradition of last summer, the Pants make their rounds again. Tibby's leaving for film school, Bridget's off to Alabama while Lena and Carmen spend their summers at home. I loved the Second Summer of the Sisterhood! This book was much more emotional than the first. I shed a few tears along the way. My favourite character in this instalment would have to be Bridget. She did a 180 from her impulsive and reckless ways in the first book and took time off to rediscover herself. I really Following the tradition of last summer, the Pants make their rounds again.

Because it's all sad stories. And Bee's not with Eric. This is the only volume sans Eric. Eric is my fav lad from the series (Leo comes second).

I enjoyed this just as much as the first book. This was a re-read for me. It wasnt as good as the first book but it was excelent. With scince fair going on i couldnt read a big fantasy book today so i thouht i would pick up this one! I'm glad this series is still holding up to what I remember it to be. Great but a tear jerker I sobbed for half of the book but I did love it. I thought the second book in the series got deeper into the series and it gets better as you read along. There were so many changes in the main characters, but at the end, it seems like they stayed true to their own self.<+++>The Second Summer of the Sisterhood</+++>", "Title": "The Second Summer of the Sisterhood"},
