I made it about 60% through before I could identify the problems. I don't care about the main protagonist AT ALL. She's a 140-something hermaphrodite of Chinese descent that grew up on Mercury (cool, right?), but at her age, she's completely self-absorbed, asks stupid questions, and selfishly makes HUGE decisions based upon input from an integrated AI in her brain: one day, she simply decided to start a revolution on Earth after seeing poor old people working in post-Saharan Africa's farms. Because they're poor. And that's no good. And they MUST be unhappy. The only remotely interesting storyline in the book, Kiran, who has been transplanted to Venus to assist in terraforming, has any traction. Unfortunately, the character (by the time I stopped reading), had only a few \"chapters\" to speak of. Some of the science is neat, but these characters jet around the solar system like no one's business, blasting past planets and YEARS in the plot; a reference was made to an event that took place a year ago, when, in fact, the event had only happened a few pages earlier. Added to this, the book frequently devolved into these mindless interludes of technobabble that do little to further the story. Two stars for interesting ideas. ...more I read maybe one sci-fi book a year. My barrier to entry is generally the writing itself.

So, it's always a pleasant surprise when I encounter a work of sci-fi that's also really well written because I am a bit of a futurist at heart and love to delve into these worlds. (It's not for nothing that Star Trek: The Next Generation was my favorite show as a kid.) I'm happy to say <+++>2312</+++> is such a work. Kim Stanley Robinson is perhaps most famous for his Mars trilogy, and from what I gather this book is typical of his earlier style. I haven't read the Mars trilogy, so I can't speak from personal experience. However, after <+++>2312</+++> I'm definitely intrigued. It's difficult to summarize this book because it's really more a history of a possible future than a traditional novel. Sure, there's a main character and a central conflict, but so much of the book deals with the meta factors of life in space cohabiting with technology that it does the book a disservice to say it's simply the story of Swan Er Hong. Swan is Mercurial - in both the sense that she's prone to sudden mood shifts and that she's from the planet Mercury (there are a lot of little puns like that throughout) - and when we first meet her she's mourning the recent death of her grandmother. The plot picks up from there with Swan getting tangled up in a type of solar system manhunt/mystery. But, 2312 isn't a mystery, not really anyway. For one thing, the action scenes are few and far between and when they do arrive they're over before you even notice. No, the focus here is most definitely on exploring the time and place. Curiously enough, the strongest narrative voice here speaks from an even more distant future so that while reading one gets the dizzying sense of looking back on a time that for one reading today hasn't yet occurred. An interesting technique, but I could see how some might consider it gimmicky. The greatest weakness here is also the novel's greatest strength. While the world building is fascinating it can at times drag on. It's worth enduring, however, as some of the most beautiful passages depict things never seen by human eyes: sunsets that last for 16 \"days\" on the moons of Saturn; clear aquarium \"terrariums\" floating in the nothingness of space; etc. Again, from what I gather, this is typical of Robinson's work, so if you're okay with that you shouldn't have any reservations about diving in. If this is the only sci-fi book I read this year, I'm glad it was such an enjoyable experience.

The lovers spin like Pluto and Charon, around the two plot Lagrange points of an endless walk beneath the surface of Mercury, and waiting to be rescued in the blackness of space- two personal moments that are stretched out like long breathes in the whirl impersonal/planetary action. Robinson even recognises his own weaknesses and future proofs his sketchier ideas in stream of consciousness hyperlinks (missing their tops and tails), suggesting an unreliable narrator, and urging the reader to assemble the cut up into the future of our choice. The sex is smart and gender theory aware. The political, economic, and environmental modelling is aggressively radical. and the prose is funny and at times heart breakingly beautiful. I will always remember the description of ancient wolf howls chasing the dawn across a continent - a primeval sunwalking that mirrors the opening of the novel. ...more This book just made me happy.

S This book just made me happy. Wonderfully, giddily happy. That's the TL;DR version: if you like nearish future sf and you would consider yourself small-l liberal and enjoy a bit of adventure and politicking, oh this is awesome. Why? There's the gender aspects. Robinson goes beyond gender-bending and into gender- thwarting . I first really realised something was going on when a new character was introduced and for the entire interaction, there were no pronouns used. And it's a gender-neutral name. So... no clue as to whether biologically or otherwise male or female, and it didn't matter in the slightest; and nor did it matter for the many other characters for whom this was also true. The gender aspect is one where Robinson's sly use of language and meta-references comes in: there's a comment somewhere (I wish I had bookmarked it!) where the difficulty in determining sex or gender is remarked on, and the fact that humanity could now be called \"ursuline\" - because of the notorious difficulty in sexing bears, is the commenter's note. But I see what you did there, Robinson, and since le Guin is one of my favourite authors, I quite literally laughed and crowed aloud. This society has what ours would regard as the \"normal\" genders (with \"outrageous\" (p431) macho and fem behaviours as something of an art form), as well androgyns, wombmen, hermaphrodites, gynandromorphs, eunuchs, and the gender-indeterminate. There are people who have fathered and mothered children at different times, people who never disclose their gender to anyone, and... really the broadest range of sexual and gender identity that I can imagine (actually, broader than I had previously imagined). So, that aspect is a lot of fun - and it's presented as normal and as a full expression of humanity. The political aspect comprehensively wooed and won me. It's common enough - perhaps not so much today, but still sometimes - in science fiction and fantasy to have a monarchy, or an authoritarian regime of some flavour to work within/against, or at any rate a government that can be seen as leaning to the right. And the characters often either agree with it or are actively rebelling against it. Robinson's solar system is far more complex and interesting. For a start the Earth isn't given a single governing body; it actually has more countries here, 300 years in the future, than it does today. The other planets and moons often have one controlling authority, but they are disparate in their aims and desires. In fact much of the inner solar system is held together as part of the Mondragon (based on the idea of a Basque town, see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondrago... ). A non-profit, cooperative-based, economic model aiming at mutual support. Yes please. This is contrasted with Earth, and again I will admit to laughing out loud at this description: \"late capitalism writhed in its internal decision concerning whether to destroy Earth's biosphere or change its rules. Many argued for the destruction of the biosphere, as being the lesser of two evil\" (p125). I laughed, and then I wept. Also this: \"confining capitalism to the margin was the great Martian achievement, like defeating the mob or any other protection racket\" (p127). A system where, overall, I feel encouraged by the politics and economic aims? Not utopian but aiming high and nobly? That makes me pretty happy. These aspects combined make this an optimistic novel about the future, which also makes me happy. Don't get me wrong: this isn't a glorious love-in where nothing bad happens, where there's sunshine and rainbows and cookies for all. Life on Earth is hard - climate change has had a serous impact, especially if you lived anywhere near the coast (or where the coast used to be...); life on Mercury and the moons involves great difficulties; there is crime and anger and wanton destruction of life. But those things exist today, too. What makes this optimistic is the attitude taken by both Robinson and many of his characters that there is something that even insignificant people can do about it all. Maybe it won't make a change immediately, and that will be annoying, but long term changes can be worked towards - they're worth working towards, and enduring the setbacks, because people and institutions can change. Of course, all of these things are well and good. The story is happy-making too. It's told largely though the lens of Swan Er Hong, resident of Mercury and restless spirit. Several other characters become important over time, and Robinson cleverly uses chapter titles to indicate which character will dominate (\"Swan and Wang\" = Swan is most important, Wang will loom large too). Speaking of chapters, there are sets of Extracts and sets of Lists scattered at different points throughout, too. Extracts are a form of info-dump, with sections of texts literally like they are extracts from news reports, histories, or scientific papers. This is a neat trick and one that felt immersive - because it could easily be Swan or another character skimming books or websites - rather than throwing the reader out by being too info-heavy. And the Lists often feel whimsical, but they certainly add depth; my favourite, in a melancholy way, is a list of words beginning with boredom and escalating to death wish; it captures quite nicely the sentiments of at least one character at the time. (There's also a wonderful list of women honoured by having a crater named after them, from Annie Oakley to Emily Dickinson by way of Sappho and Xantippe.) But back to the story: it's a curious one really. For much of the novel, it feels like the story is happening around the characters, but they're not often directly involved - at least, not in the big events: destruction of a city? Not there at the time. These big things have a big impact on our protagonists, but - much like we normal mortals experience events - those events act on them, rather than (mostly) being caused by them. For this reason Swan, for all she has important connections and is moderately famous, feels remarkably like a normal person. The narrative itself is basically a whodunit that gets bigger than expected: Swan's grandparent has died and left a somewhat unexpected inheritance, and then soon after her home, the city of Terminator on Mercury, is destroyed, leaving Swan determined to help find the culprit. This leads her all over the solar system (up to and including the moons of Saturn have been comprehensively colonised), interacting with people of all shapes and sizes (literally; being a tall or a small is more of a division in this society than gender). There's intrigue, and dismay, and maybe-love, and some wild ideas for how people in three centuries might get their kicks, from tampering with one's physiology to some rather extreme sports. Swan and friends do end up having an influence on events, but the manner and the outcome are far from predictable. Swan herself, as I said, is a fairly normal-seeming person. She gets cranky and has wild ideas and is frequently hard to please; she is contrary and independent and determined and wants the best for the universe (mostly), so who can't people just agree with her when she's clearly right, dammit? The supporting cast - Wahrum and Wang and Genette and others - are varied, from police to scientists to politicians, with a variety of sexual orientations (when it's even specified), and a plethora of priorities and ambitions of their own. The society as a whole is gloriously well realised and complex, but familiar as human nonetheless. In sum, then, this is a realistic (non-utopian), largely optimistic, enthusiastic look 300 years into the future, with complex and occasionally frustrating characters who may well remind you of people you know. This is what I would like science fiction to be like a lot more frequently. ...more I tried to read this book. I really tried.

Now this book did have some interesting premises in it, like the way the city of Terminator moved along tracks on the surface of Mercury, propelled by the thermal expansion of the tracks. Then there are the terraria; hollowed out asteroids used as miniature biospheres that replicate various habitats on Earth. Speaking of Earth, apparently the home planet wasn't liked too much by the various colonies in the solar system, but no reason was given why. It was probably revealed later on, but like I said, after getting halfway through the book and not knowing what was going on, I just had to put it down. Again, I really hate not finishing a boo, especially one that I tried so hard to get through, but it just didn't grab my attention.

In fact it was a love story, even if it was an alchemical love story of politics, intrigue, personality types (oh yes, a great deal is said about this, and I loved the exploration of opposites between routine and novelty), and even, the most unlikely of love stories I'd have ever read between Swan and Wahram. It works best if you overlay your own preconceptions with with the planets they're from, of course, and if you don't, it becomes messy. I have to say I love the novels that make me work to enjoy them, because if they pull it off, they are a wonder to behold and a novel that sits in my memory long after the book has been put down. Hell, that's the way I categorize my top 100 books of all time. I think this one is going to have a spot there. Despite this, I didn't like the lists and the quantum walks as much as I feel I should have, especially when I knew the trick. I still enjoyed the living hell out of this novel, though. :) Edit 10/21/15 Nope, it didn't make my top 100, but I still think of the novel fondly, even if it was somewhat a mess at times.

(Also, all the digital copies are DRM-free, a philosophy I support.) This year I\u2019ve actually managed to read two of the Hugo-nominated novels\u2014though 2312 is not one of them. I\u2019ve read fairly little of Kim Stanley Robinson\u2019s work, but what I have read hasn\u2019t impressed me. He\u2019s a good enough writer to deserve the reputation and fandom he has, but he\u2019s not really my kind of writer. Nevertheless, I settled into 2312 (albeit a password-protected, PDF version of 2312 ) and tried to keep an open mind. As the title suggests, 2312 is set in the opening decades of the twenty-fourth century, specifically in the years leading up to 2312. Humanity has spread across the solar system. Mars has been partially terraformed, and Venus isn\u2019t far behind. A city flees the sunrise on Mercury, moving around the planet on a system of rails. Various colonies and outposts exist on asteroids, moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and even as far out as Pluto and the Kuiper Belt. Never before has the solar system been so teeming with human life and industry. But it\u2019s still a fragile time. On Earth, the ecological problems we\u2019re beginning to see now have come to a head. While this has motivated much of the advances in spaceflight and terraforming technology, it\u2019s also created a kind of backlash. The people who live off-Earth are \u201cspacers\u201d, obvious from how they move in Earth\u2019s relatively-heavy gravity. Far from providing a united government to deal with its extraterrestrial children, Earth is more fractured than ever, with over 400 countries vying for resources that grow ever more precious each day. Robinson creates a sense that this is a planet in steep environmental decline\u2014not exactly a catastrophe as much as a long, debilitating illness\u2014and no one has really gotten their act together to try to stop it. In the rest of the system, humanity flourishes politically, psychologically, technologically. But that sense of fragility remains, as the protagonist Swan er Hong reflects upon one of her many visits to Earth. She remarks that the inhabitants of Earth have no idea how precious it is: the only place where humans can walk on the surface, under a sky, without a suit. Robinson does an amazing job letting us see Earth through her eyes, and with that sight, reawakening a love for our planet and a sense of responsibility. Humans have begun to adapt to their non-terrestrial homes. Those who live among asteroids are \u201csmalls\u201d, adults of child-like proportions, such as Inspector Jean Genette. At the other end of the scale are those who have become so accustomed to the lighter gravity that their mass would be an issue on Earth, such as Wahram. Advances in medical technology allow people to transcend our binary ideas of gender, leading to all sorts of combinations. Longevity treatments also allow people to live in excess of two hundred years. Finally, quantum computing has become a reality, albeit one still in its infancy. With so-called \u201cstrong AI\u201d in quantum boxes (even ones that can fit in someone\u2019s head!), humanity should be on a trajectory towards a golden age. Except, something fishy is afoot. With the death of Swan er Hong\u2019s grandmother Alex, she becomes inducted into a loose conspiracy investigating the qubes (quantum computer cubes). Swan\u2019s new associates, including Wahram and Genette, were working with Alex to determine whether some qubes might have self-awareness and an agenda of their own. They are not just paranoid\u2014suspicious incidents have been cropping up for the past few years that seem to point to this conclusion. Their investigations continue, in secrecy, and as Swan becomes drawn deeper into the fold, her experiences during her travels begin to change her, perhaps for the better. That\u2019s a loose plot summary, but the plot to 2312 is as incidental as it can be. It\u2019s really just an excuse for Robinson to tour the solar system, from Mercury all the way to Pluto. And I can see why: he has done an impressive job building this twenty-fourth century civilization, and he does nearly as impressive a job at telling us about it. Sure, there\u2019s some clunky exposition\u2014but I actually rather liked the \u201cextract\u201d chapters that interrupt the various character-driven chapters. It\u2019s neat to see how Robinson depicts the confluence of different technological breakthroughs and social revolutions and describes the changes that these wrought. It\u2019s not science fiction\u2019s job or purpose to predict the future, but one thing science fiction can do is offer us possible futures . To me, 2312 is a very believable picture of what the future could be like. If we developed better AI, if we had the right pressures and luck to develop slightly better space travel, if we started spreading into the solar system. Right now, even crewed expeditions to Mars remain mostly a pipe dream. But the way Robinson explains it makes it all seem not just possible but likely. His gentle, uncomplicated explanations combining physics and politics and psychology somehow leave you with the impression that this could all happen in three hundred years. Robinson provides us with an impressive scope in his setting. It\u2019s almost to the point of giving us too much , of overloading us with the variables involved to the point where the book has become a cacophonous calculation. Great science fiction often relies on simplicity, or at the very least a reductive type of complexity that allows the book to assume a still beautiful and coherent nature. 2312 is a complex, interwoven exploration of how humanity would change after three hundred years of crisis and colonization. Whereas other writers might focus on one or two \u201cBig Ideas\u201d in order to put them under the microscope and examine their consequences, Robinson remains with a bigger-picture approach. This holistic view works well, because it avoids any kind of tunnel vision that can mar otherwise interesting stories. It\u2019s all well and good to write a book about cloning. But there is never just one technological breakthrough; it\u2019s never just cloning but cloning and AI, or cloning and brain augmentation, or cloning and instant souffl\u00e9 making. However, this holistic view can also quickly become decoherent, much like the superposition in a quantum computer. It\u2019s hard for the reader to become invested in the characters. This was my problem with 2312 as a story. Swan is not a very likable protagonist, in my opinion; she is somewhat inscrutable and unknowable. We don\u2019t get a very good sense of her life: despite being over a century old, everyone still refers to her as a \u201cgirl\u201d, and despite being the revered designer of several spacefaring terraria, people still seem to look down on her as immature. Though she changes as the story progresses, I never quite feel comfortable around her. Similarly, the plot moves in fits and jerks, and sometimes it moves without seeming to move at all. There is an extensive section where Swan and Wahram are trapped beneath the surface of Mercury, forced to make a lengthy walk along service tunnels in order to reach safety. It is arguably a moment of intense character development for them, but all the while my inner critic was just screaming, \u201cGet back to the killer quantum computers already!\u201d The trouble with 2312 is that it draws from two somewhat divergent approaches to pacing. On one hand, it reminds me of Samuel R. Delany\u2019s bigger-picture work, like Triton (a book which, incidentally, deals with a lot of the same themes and issues but to better effect). On the other hand, the underlying mystery and conflicts are more suggestive of a thriller, in the vein of Richard K. Morgan\u2019s Altered Carbon . I desperately love both approaches, but I\u2019m not as fond of slamming them together in the way Robinson has done here. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that 2312 is deserving of an award like the Hugo. I\u2019m not at all surprised it won the Nebula. It has the kind of gravitas I expect from an award-winner. Indeed, when I look at the other nominees in this category, I wonder which of them will be the biggest challenger. The rest don\u2019t immediately signal how they approach the big ideas that drive the best science fiction\u2014which is not to say that they are devoid of such reflection. With 2312 , despite my complaints about its plot and story, it\u2019s obvious that this is a measured, thoughtful work about humanity\u2019s future. Robinson asks\u2014at times playfully, at times plaintively\u2014who do we want to be? ...more So at 65% I finally just kicked this pig and stopped reading. This book is objectively terrible.

So there's that. ----- edit 12/29/2015 After numerous comments I decided to clarify this review a little. 2312 is a poorly written book. The prose, the characters and the plot are terrible. And the main character does get her way by threatening to scream. If you have some argument that any of these are actually good, I would love to hear it. That would look like a breakdown of the thing (prose,character or plot) and an argument why that is actually good. The science and some of the science fiction ideas are ok. But, they are crappier versions of stuff done elsewhere. So I already agree, those things are fine. An argument along these lines would be to argue why in spite of the stuff above one or more of these aspects make the book worth it. All that said, I think the author put on giant ham shaped mittens and wrote a book that is a love letter to the execrable side of liberalism with a giant straw man of his fantasy imaginings of conservatism. It is the opposite, in some sense, of \"wizards first rule\" a book that also has terrible nonsense politics. But also differs in being adequately written and having interesting characters and plot. And to all the people who have posted that they enjoyed this because of the jackass liberalism, I agree. I told you to read it if you like jackass liberalism. ps- I kept struggling to name Robinson's political persuasion because there is nothing wrong with liberalism. I agree with the progressive aspects of liberalism and I understand the regressive and hate/fear based aspects of liberalism. And when compared to conservatives the problematic parts of liberalism are minute.

And really, Kim Stanley Robinson, I know you want to make us feel like we have really experienced living throughout the solar system, but at some point, I CANNOT TAKE ANY MORE DESCRIPTION. Could you have moderated this somewhat and still been effective? Yes. Absolutely, yes. If 2312 had been half its length, I probably would have given it four stars - at least. There is COOL SHIT in there. But as it is, I think it's a 2.5, rounded up to a 3 due to potential. Plus, there's the part where despite all the gender bending and play with sexuality, all this stuff that could have contributed to something very progressive and different... it still managed to turn into a pretty darn conventional hetero romance. In a pretty weird and somewhat forced way, actually. Really, Kim Stanley Robinson, is that where you thought your story was going? Or is that what you thought was progressive? Or what? Also, I really didn't understand the end of the Earth plot at all. But that's just a side note, a frustration, a distraction.

Robinson set out for a broad brush look at our race 300 years ahead, and this is precisely what we get. The tale takes us to many locations in the future solar system --- Mercury and the city on the Terminator, Venus with its solar shield, Saturn and its multiple terraria, Earth and its old world colonialism. The only venue missing is Mars, but then, Robinson has written a boatload on Mars. There is an SF mystery that ties the story together, but this a tiny thread within the fabric of the whole narrative. The author will expound on almost every subject, including a dispassionate treatise on the nature of evil, how love and relationships may evolve in the future and detailed economics of space colonies. A prolonged sequence of two characters walking through the tunnels that gird Mercury left me wondering where the story was going. But Robinson, unhurriedly, takes us on a tour of the places he wants us to see and the subjects he wants us to pay attention to. This is the type of book that takes a while to get through, not a page-turner by any means, but still a rewarding read. The aspect of it that struck me most was the author's originality and thoughtfulness. There are no throw away scenes or concepts. The SF elements are quite good and just as gosh-wow as something one might find in an Alastair Reynolds book. If there's anything that detracts from the reading experience, it is that Robinson tackles any subject with a clinical detachment, as if he puts each on a slab of glass and examines microscopically. If you can adopt to the style, this can be worth your time. An outstanding effort. 4 stars. [This was my first full novel by [author:Kim Stanley Robinson|1858] though I've been aware of his work since the early Ace paperbacks, and through his Nebula winning Mars books. I will try and read more of his work, albeit at a slow pace of maybe 1 or 2 a year.] ...more Abandoning this one at about the 50% mark. I gave it the ol' college try, but turns out this really ain't for me. Densely written, huge passages of world-building (and terraforming), but not enough of a propulsive plot or engaging characters to keep me turning the pages. I may be overdosing on this particular susgenre, since I read Blue Remembered Earth recently, and The Quiet War not long before that. They essentially tell the same story, but whats disturbing is that they essentially come to the same conclusion. All of this seems to come down to the Richard Florida version of the future. The 24th century for hipsters. They're liberal-geek amusement parks. A guided tour of one half of the western culture war. The roller coaster of exciting new urbanism.

The 24th century for hipsters. They're liberal-geek amusement parks. A guided tour of one half of the western culture war. The roller coaster of exciting new urbanism. The merry go round of climate change. Ferris wheel of non heteronormativity. That cute little train that goes around the park* of multiculturalism. It's all very adorable and convenient, if you like that sort of thing, and I do like that sort of thing. I am so the target audience of these books it's not even funny. I read them, I enjoy them, i'll read more of them. I can read fanciful descriptions of space habitats, anarchist economic systems and new-fangled family arrangements until the cows come home. And I like amusement parks too. But after a while, i'd like to see the rest of whats out there too. Basically, this now entirely failing to be in any way interesting or awe inspiring or thought provoking. It's just a kind of geek trivia porn. I read this stuff the way I read history articles on Cracked.com. I don't find it at all convincing, which, fair enough - SF is about the present, not about the future, ok. But it doesn't work for the present either. Its too neat and colorful in a tourist brochure sort of way. These futures don't feel in the slightest foreign or disorienting or futuristic. Lots of sex without gender. Lots of colonization without colonialism. Superficial multiracialism while actual religeon, culture and ideology become cheerfully contained esoterica, human variety for the sake of decoration. This isn't the future, its just the internet. Would someone please write something challenging? *But only if it's got rails. If it's actually a tractor pulling wagons on car wheels, it can go fuck itself. ...more This book is huge in breadth and depth, covering everything from falling in love, the destruction of cities, the precise techniques required to recreate terran microbiomes, artificial intelligences integrating with human society...Sometimes I grew frustrated because the book spent fifty pages recounting two characters whistling to each other, and only a paragraph to enact and then dismiss a plan to provide affordable housing for all people on Earth.

I wasn't always on board with the focus or the pacing of this book, but was, against my will at times, always fascinated by whatever was on the page. Despite engrossing me, neither the plot nor the characters were all that well developed. Swan and Wahram get more development near the end, but Kirin remains just a pawn pinballing between information brokers, and the plots are wrapped up very quickly and mostly off-page. I loved the excerpts from histories, anthropologies, and technical manuals from various times (past, present, and very far future); I was dubious at first due to the unexpected style of them but rapidly found them the most enjoyable part of all. It is, overall, a sprawling and pragmatic book, and yet strangely hopeful about our present and future, as organisms and as part of a larger universe. ...more Genel olarak kitaba 7/10 veriyorum ama kitab\u0131 ikiye ay\u0131rmak laz\u0131m; bir k\u0131s\u0131m ana karakterlerin i\u00e7ine dahil oldu\u011fu \u00f6yk\u00fc di\u011fer k\u0131s\u0131m ise kitab\u0131n anlatt\u0131\u011f\u0131 evren hakk\u0131nda bilgiler verilen b\u00f6l\u00fcmler. \u0130lk k\u0131sma puan\u0131m 6/10, ikinci k\u0131sma ise 8/10.

Oradaki politik oyunlar\u0131n yar\u0131s\u0131 bile yoktu bu kitapta, daha ufak \u00e7apl\u0131 \u015feyler ya\u015fan\u0131yordu.

Cinsiyet konusuna gelince... Kitab\u0131n bence arkas\u0131n\u0131 en \u00e7ok bo\u015f b\u0131rakt\u0131\u011f\u0131 yerlerden biri buydu.

Bunlardan ba\u015fka bir \u015fey yok kitapta. Herkes birbirinin cinsiyetine sayg\u0131l\u0131, farkl\u0131 cinsel rolleri \u00fcstlenmek konusunda kimsenin bir problemi yokmu\u015f gibi g\u00f6r\u00fcn\u00fcyor hatta ana karakterlerimiz bile bunu yapt\u0131klar\u0131ndan bahsediyorlar.

I finished 2312 and overall I wouldn't call it disappointing as I did not expect that much from it, but I wish the author would write better prose as the book is full of interesting ideas; that however is not enough as the novel is utterly lifeless and it reads like a play on an empty stage where characters rush along and try to engage the spectators in an imagination game (see, now I am traveling to Earth, now I am on Mercury, now we are in a spaceship...) while a constant flow of information rolls in the background... In other words, the book has no \"external reality\" and the main characters read like paper constructs than actual living human beings Here is a little more coherent take on the above as done on FBC: There are a lot of detailed and raving reviews out there about 2312 by Kim Stanley Robinson and I can appreciate them intellectually, but for me the \"writing magic\" that makes a book more than a collection of words without special meaning beyond the dictionary one, mostly lacks here. I wouldn't call the novel disappointing as I did not expect that much from it considering my past experience with the author's style, but I wish the author would write better prose as the book is full of interesting ideas. That however is not enough as the novel is utterly lifeless and it reads like a play on an empty stage where characters rush along and try to engage the spectators in an imagination game: see, now I am traveling to Earth, now I am on Mercury, now we are in a spaceship, while a constant flow of information rolls in the background... In other words 2312 reminded me strongly of the TV play adaptions where characters talk and talk and describe action happening to them, though we actually have to imagine it, rather then see it...That's fine if the actors are great, but here as mentioned we have just a string of words... So overall, 2312 has no \"external reality\" and the main characters read like paper constructs than actual living human beings and the book is most liekly the last I will ever attempt from the author as if one of the most interesting subjects possible for me (solar system space opera) and the book reads lifeless, there is no point in wasting time again. ...more I couldn't get through with this book. Unfortunately I had to DNF it. It took too long for me to process the whole sci-fi realm. 2/3 of the way through this one. Not as good as some of his previous works so far. Could do without the \"lists\" and other iterations, and some of the fragmented partial commentaries from fictitious future reference works. The usual KSR weirdness abounds, particularly his love of unconventional and experimental social arrangements (he truly is the contemporary science fiction author most like Robert Heinlein in this regard).

The usual KSR weirdness abounds, particularly his love of unconventional and experimental social arrangements (he truly is the contemporary science fiction author most like Robert Heinlein in this regard). This is yet another book about colonizing and/or terraforming planets in the solar system. In this book, all of the planets from Mercury to Saturn have some sort of human habitation on or around them (generally on the moons of the gas giants). Mars has long been terraformed, Venus is being terraformed (natural gases and sulphuric acid in the dense atmosphere, a surface temperature that can melt metal, greenhousing totally run amok... good luck with all of that!), and asteroids in the belt are being hollowed out and spun to create artificial habitats and gravity... making big lifeless rocks into living planetessimals. Lots of interesting ideas so far, particularly his concept of 'the greater Mondragon cooperative', a network of AIs that run a macroeconomy of vital necessities throughout the solar system. As usual in a KSR book, I've got to pause every few pages to ponder, and I'm generally enjoying reading the book. ...more I need to use the word \"transcendent\" to talk about a book with spaceships in it. I am fully aware that this is a silly thing to do, and I hope that one day you can forgive me. But really, 2312 is a transcendent work of science fiction. Let's start with the science fiction and work our way up to the transcendence. So. Three hundred years from now (q.v. the book's title), we've managed to colonize the solar system and we've started terraforming some likely planets, moons, and asteroids. The adven I need to use the word \"transcendent\" to talk about a book with spaceships in it. I am fully aware that this is a silly thing to do, and I hope that one day you can forgive me. But really, 2312 is a transcendent work of science fiction. Let's start with the science fiction and work our way up to the transcendence. So. Three hundred years from now (q.v. the book's title), we've managed to colonize the solar system and we've started terraforming some likely planets, moons, and asteroids. The advent of powerful quantum computation is a real presence in this effort, and hugely extends humanity's technological reach. And medical technology has advanced to the point where humanity has started to speciate into different variations with all kinds of weird body types and more than two genders. Oh, plus a two hundred year lifespan is starting to seem reasonable. That's all really rich material, and good sci fi has been written about any one of these ideas alone. But Kim Stanley Robinson takes all of these ideas together and builds something large, profound, and beautiful with them. Take the colonization of the solar system for example. This is driven by environmental catastrophe on Earth (totally understandable, given the bottomless dithering about climate change we see in 2012) and in turn it drives an expansion into new economies and systems of government. So in addition to the exciting plot and the rich emotional lives of the characters (I'm getting there, hold on) you, the reader, also get to think about twelve billion people living all over the solar system. Is 21st century American-style capitalism the natural course for all these people in all these different environments? What does the working day look like for somebody who grows up on Mercury? How would she relate to somebody who grew up on one of Saturn's moons? The miracle of 2312 is that it doesn't turn into a giant essay on political science. Instead, Robinson manages to explore and develop all these ideas through strong, vital characters moving in an exciting plot. (In a science fiction novel! Imagine that!) Things kick off with Swan Er Hong, a citizen of Mercury's only city, dealing with the unexpected death of her grandmother Alex. Alex was a politically important figure in the solar system, and this importance sucks Swan into an rich and complicated world of interplanetary politics, space travel, and quantum computers that may or may not be behaving strangely. (Get it? Quantum physics joke -- you're welcome.) It's worth stressing this point: Swan is a fascinating protagonist. She used to be a scientist who designed and built enormous, space-bound terraria to house animals and ecosystems that can't survive on post-climate-change Earth anymore. But now she's an artist, because somehow that other work wasn't rewarding for her? She grew up on Mercury and has, yes, a mercurial temperament. And along the way she meets huge, intensely contemplative, toadlike Wahram. Wahram has a complicated past that involves manual labor but also apparently a nontrivial role in the politics of Saturn. (Wahram is a titanic, saturnine citizen of Saturn's moon Titan. This would be trite if it wasn't so well done.) Then, lots of things happen to them. I want you to understand how great this is. It is a real rarity in contemporary fiction - especially genre fiction, but also in TV and movies - to find characters who are totally actualized, who speak with their own voice instead of the author's voice, who are not just robots built to drive the machinery of the plot. Instead, each character is unique and together they interact in ways that totally make sense given this uniqueness. I guess I have high standards for books about space travel? Anyway, to sum up, I'll just say woo- wee Kim Stanley Robinson can write! It's very hard for me to understand how there can be so much breadth and depth in a 550-page book. How can you have a book about interplanetary politics that is also about one person's complicated emotional life? There are only a few other books I can think of that manage this successfully and I love them so much: Neal Stephenson's Anathem takes breaks from the action to explore dialogues - all of them relevant to the plot, but also just intellectually cool - between a teacher and a student; Frank Herbert's Dune starts chapters with excerpts from a scholarly work on galactic history; and of course Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy quotes liberally from the titular Guide . 2312 manages this in a more postmodern way, by sprinkling the book with 1-2 page \"Excerpts\". It's not explained what these passages are excerpted from, but it doesn't matter. They're a great way for you to catch your breath and put the action into a larger context. Some of them are long and expository, but some of them are short little political-scientific lightning strikes: ...any given economic system or historical moment is an unstable mix of past and future systems. Capitalism therefore was the combination or battleground of its residual element, feudalism, and its emergent element -- what? ... as feudalism is the residual on Earth, capitalism is the residual on Mars I chewed on that one for a while before I moved on to the next chapter. Or how about this one: It was rumored in these years that Martian spies were everywhere in the system, but that they were constantly reporting back to headquarters that there was nothing to fear -- balkanization meant Mars faced nothing but a stochastic chaos of human flailing This is what ends up making 2312 transcendent instead of just \"good\" or \"exciting\". There's just so much more than you could possibly expect from a single science fiction novel. It manages to look forward to a plausible, exciting future for humanity, totally, but it also somehow manages to make deeply incisive observations about the world we actually live in today, in reality. It explores wild new ways of being a human being - Swan Er Hong has given birth to a child, has also fathered a child, and has an extremely powerful computer implanted in her head - but the book still throws much of its emotional weight behind the growing, blossoming relationship between two interesting people. (Just like Jane Austen does, but different!) The action spans the solar system and multiple governments on multiple planets, but there are wildly exciting, nail-biting chapters devoted to small groups of people in difficult, exciting situations. And all the future-y technology-related stuff is cool and forward-looking while still seeming plausible. 2312 manages to be great in every way that a science fiction novel can possibly be good. Read it. ...more I've finished Kim Stanley Robinson's 2312, which in some ways I liked a lot and in others found a little frustrating. Mostly I didn't feel Swan's voice was much differentiated from previous KSR protagonists, though the other two major POV characters were reasonably different. I liked the development of the romance and the world, I liked many of the choices the characters made, I just sort of felt like I could switch Frank out for Swan and it wouldn't be significantly different.

The other problem I had with it is sort of...philosophical. It's sort of \"he didn't write the book I wanted him to!\", though that's not exactly accurate either, because I like what and how KSR does. But like the Science in the Capitol trilogy, which is some of my favorite writing ever, 2312 isn't an enormously accessible book. I mean, I'm okay with that because I like hard SF and I'm willing to put the time in, but ... I think the climate change theme that's so central to these books is hugely, hugely important, and I think he realizes it brilliantly, and I want everyone to read it and understand what he's seeing in our world that develops into his fiction, but...this is SF for SF lovers, not for casual readers. I still desperately want that gap bridged, and KSR writes so beautifully I want him to be able to do it, but he doesn't. And I don't think it's even his goal, so I recognize that my frustrations are ill placed here, but...damn. I do so want that accessible, world-changing climate change SF story to be *out there*. ...more I hate to rate this so low. The book was pretty ambitious and quite detailed.

When I read I am not always ready to learn a completely new language and enter into other worlds with rules I am unfamiliar with. It sounds lazy and maybe it is. I recognize Robinson's talent and I am jealous of those who can keep up. But for 20 minutes before bed time or catching a chapter on the front porch, it does not lend itself to the serious study demanded. ...more The world is so careful constructed, the colonized Solar System is so beautiful, the gender questions are so interesting that you can almost overlook the thinness of the characters and the unengaging story. There is an astonishing setpiece in this book where Swan visits New York, which climate change and rising sea levels has turned into a kind of new Venice. Fresh from space, Swan's intoxication with the beauty of Earth and the wonder of New York's transformation is ravishing. So much SF these days focuses on the negative aspects of science and technology; KSR is quite old-fashioned in that he thinks we have enough of a technological base at the moment to get us through to a new level. What has hap There is an astonishing setpiece in this book where Swan visits New York, which climate change and rising sea levels has turned into a kind of new Venice. Fresh from space, Swan's intoxication with the beauty of Earth and the wonder of New York's transformation is ravishing. So much SF these days focuses on the negative aspects of science and technology; KSR is quite old-fashioned in that he thinks we have enough of a technological base at the moment to get us through to a new level. What has happened to NY is a disaster; but KSR chooses to look at it almost as an evolutionary step. It happened, and so we deal with it. Life, in all its infinite probabilities, goes on. This is by no means an easy read: the slight, and quite prosaic, plot of a system-wide conspiracy by quantum computers to change the course of human evolution is peppered with vast chunks of info-dumping -- a technique that KSR has turned into an art form. The characters are complicated and humane, even the aliens. The writing is exquisite, and the intellectual joie de vivre is dazzling.(Thank heavens I read this on a Kindle with a built-in dictionary, as there are many scientific words and terms I had to look up.) Note: I was intrigued at how similar 2312 starts off to Blue Remembered Earth by Alastair Reynolds. It is almost as if the two authors were given the same writing assignment and told to riff on it; KSR's take quickly veers of on its own trajectory. 2312 also reminded me of Paul McAuley's Quiet War trilogy. ...more 4 Stars 2312 is a tough book to review, there is a great deal to like and to recommend in this one, but there are also some big issues too. As many reviewers have pointed out, this book leans towards hard science fiction without ever really becoming a teaching lesson. To me, it is a speculative piece of fiction that incorporates real mechanisms behind the physics and the biology of the future presented. It is intelligent, well thought out, and researched.

To me, it is a speculative piece of fiction that incorporates real mechanisms behind the physics and the biology of the future presented. It is intelligent, well thought out, and researched. This was my first Kim Stanley Robinson and I can now say that I am a fan and will quickly seek out his other works. The writing style, craft, and structure make 2312 worth a read. It is exceptional, thought provoking, and literary. Robinson throws in many thrilling and cool interlude chapters that cover subject matters that are not necessarily part of the main plot. Here is a some what large example of what I mean about his writing style. \u201cBefore that\u2014one last look at sunrise on Mercury. In the ultraviolet it\u2019s a perpetual blue snarl of hot and hotter. With the disk of the photosphere blacked out, the fantastic dance of the corona becomes clearer, all the magnetized arcs and short circuits, the masses of burning hydrogen pitched out at the night. Alternatively you can block the corona, and look only at the sun\u2019s photosphere, and even magnify your view of it, until the burning tops of the convection cells are revealed in their squiggling thousands,each a thunderhead of fire burning furiously, all together torching five million tons of hydrogen a second\u2014at which rate the star will burn another four billion years. All these long spicules of flame dance in circular patterns around the little black circles that are the sunspots\u2014shifting whirlpools in the storms of burning. Masses of spicules flow together like kelp beds threshed by a tide. There are nonbiological explanations for all this convoluted motion\u2014different gases moving at different speeds, magnetic fields fluxing constantly, shaping the endless whirlpools of fire\u2014all mere physics, nothing more\u2014but in fact it looksalive, more alive than many a living thing. Looking at it in the apocalypse of the Mercurial dawn, it\u2019s impossible to believe it\u2019s not alive. It roars in your ears, it speaks to you.\u201d Another example that throws in some cool science: \u201cSorry, but it\u2019s true. It has to be said: the stars exist beyond human time, beyond human reach. We live in the little pearl of warmth surrounding our star; outside it lies a vastness beyond comprehension. The solar system is our one and only home. Even to reach the nearest star at our best speed would take a human lifetime or more. We say \u201cfour light- years\u201d and those words \u201cfour\u201d and \u201cyears\u201d fool us; we have little grasp of how far light travels in a year. Step back and think about 299,792,458 meters per second, or 186,282 miles per second\u2014whichever you think you can grasp better. Think of that speed as traversing 671 million miles in every hour. Think about it traversing 173 astronomical units a day; an astronomical unit is the distance from the Earth to the Sun, thus 93 million miles\u2014crossed 173 times in a day. Then think about four years of days like that. That gets light to the nearest star. But we can propel ourselves to only a few percent of the speed of light; so at 2 percent of the speed of light (ten million miles an hour!) it will take about two hundred years to go those four light-years. And the first stars with Earthlike planets are more like twenty light-years away.\u201d Things I loved: The writing, the amazing INTERLUDES, the world building, the sexual mixup, the love story, everything about Mercury, the animal invasion, human nature, and Warham. Things that I didn't love: Swan(she is by her nature a tough protagonist for us to really bond with), sometimes the pacing, the almost irrelevance of the Qubes, the flat ending, and not enough of the cool interlude chapters. At the end of the day I really enjoyed this read and if not for a few quirks, I would have loved it. Either way, I highly recommend this to science fiction readers, others may be turned off by it. ...more A finished copy was provided by the publisher for review.

Gender is no longer the greatest divide in humanity. \"The double lock and key\" seems to be a perfect match and experience since it contains all pleasures at once. It was a rather odd and interesting chapter which I had to re-read again. I truly love the idea of being able to travel freely between planets. Space travel in the future is a MUST. If you're looking for a book that has incredible world building then 2312 is your book. This is why I loved it so much. There's an extensive amount of detail. Detail that I can't help but want to Google just to see if it's true. I loved how Stanley made the earth and the rest of the planets his own form of fiction. It sounds way to realistic to even be fiction. I can definitely see society heading into this direction. I don't know much about the gender divide in this book, well because there is none. There are people with two sex organs. And yes they do have sex in a weird concept I had to re-read but was fascinated as well. Sure I didn't understand it as much as I liked to but it was rather intriguing to think about. I haven't read my fair share of science fiction novels, an adult one no less, but this one stood out. Don't pick up this book if you're looking for a story-line because it's not plot driven. It's incredibly detailed and winded and the plot is dropped here and there by various states. It wasn't the best story and not all that exciting, but like I said before, the world building is intense and that's what made me keep reading. I'm definitely checking out more of Stanley's work, especially his Mars trilogy. ...more First book of the year that I was simply unable to finish.

While at first I was intrigued as the author introduces us to life on Mercury in the year 2312, the pages quickly turned into an information-dump where $10 words were substituted for perfectly good and understandable common words. I shouldn't have to run to a dictionary or spend hours on the internet looking up things such as the pseudoiterative. Somewhere in this info-dump is supposed to be a love story. Our protagonists (a hermaphrodite from Mercury and a frog-type-person from one of the moons of Jupiter), however, are so bland and lost in the confusion that they never generate any kind of sympathy (or even recognition). While Robinson throws in a clever page or two every once in a while (building your own travelling terrarium out of an astroid as a How-To book), there simply isn't enough of that to keep us going. Vacillating between bored and irritated, I gave up 250 pages in. Sorry. ...more Perhaps I didn't like this more because the time spent drifting about the solar system slowed down the momentum. It is an espionage thriller in form, although too digressive to be thrilling. It's a future in which people live much longer, and most of the human settlements are beyond scarcity. Earth, by way of contrast, really sucks. Endemic poverty, disease, all the social ills humanity is heir to, and the sea levels did rise with predictably disastrous results.

Earth, by way of contrast, really sucks. Endemic poverty, disease, all the social ills humanity is heir to, and the sea levels did rise with predictably disastrous results. There are lots of entertaining and thought-provoking ideas, some of which seemed logical and others impossible. What I really enjoyed was seeing what the various outposts were like. I got a deliciously strong sense of Mars, and a nice tour of other planets and moons, and that was all good. But despite the high body count, the motley counter-terrorist group was so laconic, it left the book a bit dull for me. Sure, you're good for 200 years you have a different sort of long view than someone who only lives 35 years, but it wasn't that. Or, at least, I didn't feel like it was that. For me it was an interesting tour of space totally devoid of narrative urgency. Lots of pretty sites, though.

The two of his books that I've previously read were both well-written, although for my taste, they spent too long without people on the scientific exposition. I am okay with scientific exposition, but in slightly smaller doses. Or mixed with people. For his early books (and the two I've read were early in his career - the first two Mars books), there are just too many data dumps.
