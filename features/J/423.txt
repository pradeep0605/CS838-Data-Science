Houellebecq evidently believes that he's watching the last days of Western civilization, if not of humanity as a whole, and he's interested in exploring what went wrong. He thinks that it's something very much to do with how we experience sex, and how the desire for sex acts on us. So, here we have dull, inert, 40-ish Michel, who hates his job, has no partner or other meaningful relationship, and in fact no interests at all in life. The only thing that he actually enjoys is patronizing the occasional prostitute. When he's able to afford it, he goes off to Thailand for a spot of sex tourism. As he wistfully tells us, Thai prostitutes are the best in the world. I recently read the same thing in another French novel, and for all I know it's true. We get to see a couple of Michel's encounters with Thai massage girls; these scenes were nicely done, and came across as credible.<---F> The girls are sympathetically portrayed</---F>. On his trip, Michel meets Val\u00e9rie, an attractive 28 year old. He doesn't quite manage to respond to her obvious advances, but she gives him her telephone number. Shortly after they get back to Paris, they get together. Things completely click between them. Michel is at first unsure why Val\u00e9rie is interested in him. She's young and hot, he's middle-aged and dull. However, she has a secret. She's very successful in her career as a low-ranking executive in a travel agency. After they've been to bed for the first time, she confesses how much she makes; it's a lot more than he does. And she's a workaholic, who puts in eighty hours or so most weeks. This, I imagine, is enough to scare most guys off. But Michel doesn't feel threatened at all. Val\u00e9rie is enchanted. Though Michel never quite admits it, they are blissfully in love. So far, I thought the book was surprisingly positive for a Houellebecq, but I should of course have known better. As people do when they're in love, they each try to give each other the thing they want most. Michel's a sex addict, and Val\u00e9rie, who has a sweet and generous nature, tries to help him live out all the sexual fantasies he's never had a chance to experience. Some of these aren't very tasteful. But, oddly enough, it's what he does for her that's genuinely repulsive. Michel's an insightful thinker, and, as Val\u00e9rie describes her life working as a strategist at a top-ranking travel agency, he helps her refine a new and logical idea. Many people, like him, really go on the trips to do sex tourism; so why not take the next step, and reorganize the enterprise with that thought explicitly in mind? From now on, you know something bad will eventually happen, and indeed it does. Houellebecq appears to believe that there is no hope for us at all, but he offers interesting new angles on why that might be. I wish I could immediately say why his arguments were exaggerated and wrong. ____________________________________________ So, I feel that no one is buying my arguments about why this book has a worthwhile side to it. Let me give it one last shot. First, everyone else seems to have read it in English, and I do get the impression from Choupette's comments that the English translation is poor. The French original is elegantly and wittily written. For example, here's a nice passage from an early chapter, which I'm sure will appeal to many GR readers: Je passai ma derni\u00e8re journ\u00e9e de cong\u00e9 dans differents agences de voyage. J'aimais les catalogues de vacances, leur abstraction, leur mani\u00e8re de r\u00e9duire les lieux du monde \u00e0 une sequence limit\u00e9e de bonheurs possibles et de tarifs; j'appreciais particulierement le syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9toiles, pour indiquer l'intensit\u00e9 de bonheur qu'on \u00e9tait en droit d'\u00e9sp\u00e9rer. (I passed my last free day in a few travel agencies. I love the abstract nature of travel brochures, the way in which they reduce the whole world to a finite sequence of possible types of pleasure, and their associated prices; I particularly appreciate the system by which a number of stars is used to indicate the intensity of pleasure one has the right to expect). You see later that this is not just an empty epigram, but sums up an important part of the book's argument. Similarly, Michel's father's death, though it appears random at the time, is in retrospect important foreshadowing. The novel is in fact quite tightly constructed. Michel and Val\u00e9rie are of course monsters, but the poor translation means that you aren't even tempted to sympathize with them. In French, I did want to support them at times. The scene where Michel admits to the other members of his group that he patronizes Thai prostitutes I found for example very funny, and his interlocutor came across as a PC idiot. I'd be interested to know how English readers reacted to this passage. What I found scary and convincing about Plateforme was the coherent case it made that sex tourism isn't the regrettable exception; rather, it sums up the First World's way of dealing with the Third World. The author also did a lot to show you how the mechanisms worked. Throughout most of the book, I had a hard time accepting Val\u00e9rie as an evil person. She loves her job, and takes great pleasure in doing it to the best of her ability. Michel loves her, and he wants to help her succeed. But the consequence of that is that they cooperate in building up a gigantic network of prostitution. They know they're doing it, but the logic of the market means that they don't feel they have any choice. They don't see themselves as bad people, and some of the time I found myself accepting their version of reality. I thought that was quite interesting. ____________________________________________ I just noticed the ads that Google put next to this review: Asian women look for men Women from Philippines, Thailand, and other asian countries www.AsianKisses.de Meet Thai Ladies Beautiful Thai Women Seeking Men For Love & Marriage.

(If a book makes you think this much, can it be all bad?) It seems to me that there is a tight connection between Plateforme and Les Particules \u00c9l\u00e9mentaires , which Houellebecq wrote just before it. In both books, the central theme is an analysis of contemporary sexual behavior from the point of view of Chicago-school economic theory. As another reviewer said, there are many resonances with Naomi Klein's exposition in The Shock Doctrine . I know, as one might put it, fuck all about economics, but it seems to me that Les Particules primarily takes a macroeconomic view, and argues that Western societies, sexually as well as economically, are becoming stratified, with a substantial proportion of the population relegated to the position of essentially having nothing. Plateforme , on the other hand, appears to be more a micro-economic analysis; it focuses on the individual decisions made by the sexual consumer, and how the aggregate of these many micro-decisions together build up the overall sexual-economic structure. I find Houellebecq's analysis very interesting, but the assumption I'm least ready to accept is that most men, irrespective of their own age, would now automatically prefer to have sex with young women in the 18-25 age group. Personally, I don't feel that way. I'm afraid, however, that I can't offer any hard evidence against Houellebecq's assertion, and the huge mainstream success of the porn industry does tend to support it. This does rather take us back to the initial point Choupette made in her review. As she put it: It reads like the fantasy of some horny middle-aged shit with nothing better to do with his time, like one of those disgusting old men who stares at my legs on the train. It's enough to make a girl wear pants, for goodness' sake. Well, exactly. Houellebecq's arguing that most men are now like that, except that some of them aren't staring in such an obvious way. But is his claim in fact true? I'd love to see a serious empirical study. Meanwhile, you might want to answer this poll . ____________________________________________ Well, I won't pretend that it proves anything... but of the twelve people who have so far answered my poll, not one said that they would prefer their sexual partner to be between 18 and 25. The most popular answers were \"25-35\" and \"Age genuinely doesn't matter to me\". Of course, they could be a very skewed sample. Or they could be lying. Or both. If anyone is able to repeat this experiment using a better methodology, please let me know what you discover! ...more An 18-rated review of an 18-rated book.

He\u2019s trying to make a serious or black-comedy ironic point about the state of first world/third world relationships and how everyone could be made happier if we only just lightened up about sex tourism. And he scuppers his own novel because he includes this stuff : (Michel \u2013 that\u2019s the protagonist, yes, same name as the novelist, and his brilliant girlfriend Valerie are out on the town in Paris. Now read on!) It was a Saturday night, the place was quite full. We met a really nice black couple; she was a nurse and he was a jazz drummer. \u2026[three sentences later] We finished our drinks and headed up to the rooms. He suggested a double penetration to Valerie. She agreed, as long as I was the one to sodomise her. So the two guys do the two girls and I must admit I lolled at this : Everything went smoothly, I was agreeably surprised by my own stamina. Well, bien sur, mon ami, that\u2019s what happens in porn. The sex is always stratospheric, the orgasms always geyser forth like an Icelandic hot spring, and everyone is able to have about five or six per hour, the gentlemen\u2019s members are always like several iron bars welded together, they never ever suffer from erectile dysfunction, and the girls always regard what comes out of the end of them like normal people regard a glass of Vosne-Romanee burgundy, the girls are always gagging to have everything shoved everywhere, and they always want to do it again ten minutes later, and no one has any diseases. So Michel and Valerie\u2019s evening struck me as a little unlikely, but maybe I should get out more. Or not, of course. A few pages before that, they were in Cuba on holiday having sex in their hotel room, and they\u2019ve left the curtains open. A maid sees them. Valerie got up, walked towards her, and held out her hands. And that\u2019s all it takes \u2013 the maid is young, gorgeous, and completely into the idea of a threesome at the drop of a broom. Mais bien sur, again. She\u2019s not 52, varicose-veined and asthmatic. Well, this is all ridiculous French Swingers A-Go-Go, and it makes it <+++>Platform</+++> a very silly novel indeed. This novel is about sex tourism and never mentions drugs, or the miserable lives of the sex workers. In fact, all the sex workers are happy hookers who are glad to be able to work that thing to bring joy to the face of whatever potbellied manbreasted Western male they are lucky enough to have copped off with. I should say that this did not make <+++>Platform</+++> resound with believability for me. Anyway, in Platform we get the narrative of a disenchanted loner who goes on a sex holiday to Thailand and hooks up with one of his fellow tourists Valerie and falls in love. And they have great and plentiful sex (see above). He\u2019s in his 40s, she\u2019s 28 with a cleavage to drown in and she likes girls too. Naturellement! So this is standard male fantasy territory (in porn and in Hollywood, all males over the age of 40 are able to captivate a knockout girl in her 20s. Also in arty movies, same thing. Look at all Woody Allen movies. I saw Manhattan recently - in that a late 30s Woody is sleeping with Marielle Hemingway who is 17. Sorry, I digress). Added to that, and given equal prominence, is a steady stream of piquant miserablist ruminations on the state of life in the West. I cannot deny, these are hysterical. Men live alongside one another like cattle; it is a miracle if once in a while they manage to share a bottle of booze. It is in our relations with other people that we gain a sense of ourselves; it\u2019s that, pretty much, that makes relations with other people unbearable. In most circumstances of my life, I have had about as much freedom as a vacuum cleaner. Gradually everything becomes too difficult : that\u2019s what life comes down to. When all\u2019s said and done, the idea of the uniqueness of the individual is nothing more than pompous absurdity. Anything can happen in life, especially nothing. And, the aphorism which seems to sum up MH\u2019s jeremiad pretty well : We have created a system in which it has simply become impossible to live; and what\u2019s more, we continue to export it. Anyway, MH-the-protagonist goes on at length about how in the West we all run around working like mad and making money and in the process becoming so exhausted that sex \u2013 never mind love \u2013 becomes far too much trouble. We\u2019ve become so picky and self-centred we wouldn\u2019t dream of devoting ourselves to the pleasure of others, even for 15 minutes. So we have money but we\u2019re miserable, because we still want the sex and the affection. Therefore, we should all \u2013 men and women \u2013 go to Thailand for 2 weeks every year. There the natives have nothing except their extremely attractive bodies. They love nothing more than to devote their entire working lives to making you \u2013 yes you! come on, no false modesty please \u2013 achieve the kind of orgasms you never knew were possible. You know you want to! To sum up the rest of the novel \u2013 \u201cand we\u2019d have gotten away with it too, ifn it weren\u2019t for them pesky Muslim terrorists!\u201d This was a fun novel to read \u2013 it was so odd, so ridiculous, so pompous, so off the scale unrealistic, so almost-racist, so insulting to all and sundry including specific Frederick Forsyth and John Grisham novels (he takes a page or so to slag off these books, quoting from them without any acknowledgement anywhere), so downbeat and so raving mad that I should give it 3 stars, except that it really is almost complete rubbish. ...more I just finished this today, reading outside by a corporate fountain on pine street.

Bravo! Gut gemacht! Diese Karrikaturen von M\u00e4nnern glauben doch wirklich, es gibt alles umsonst ohne irgendeine Gegenleistung nur weil sie Gottes Geschenk an die Menschheit sind. Die erz\u00e4hlerischen St\u00e4rken von Houellebecq sind die treffenden Skizzierungen von unterschiedlichen Charakt\u00e4ren und die Beschreibung der thal\u00e4ndischen Rundreise. Auch die ersten Sexszenen, als der alternde Beamte unverhofft auf seine gro\u00dfe Liebe Valerie trifft, sind nicht schlecht geschrieben. Leider bleibt es dabei, dass sich der Autor bei dieser offensichtlich tiefen innigen Beziehung im Ausdruck der Gef\u00fchle nur auf das Schlafzimmer beschr\u00e4nkt und bald wird das Rein-Raus-Spiel inklusive 3ern und 4ern mit wechselnden Partnern (man will ja nicht pr\u00fcde sein und braucht st\u00e4ndig einen neuen Kick) - g\u00e4hnend laangweilig und auch flach. F\u00fcr einen Autor, der sein Handwerk verstehen sollte, sind die Gef\u00fchle dieser Beziehung total armselig fast schon wortkarg beschrieben. Dann erfolgt die Konzeption der \"Plattform\", auf der laut Klappentext jeder gibt was er/sie hat, die einen ihren K\u00f6rper, die anderen Geld. Ja in welcher Zeit ist denn dieser Methusalix von Autor aufgewachsen? Im Jahr 2002 keine Internet Plattform? Diese Konzeption h\u00e4tte mich wirklich interessiert. Nein Houellebecq ist sowohl in seiner Gef\u00fchlsarmut als auch in der Zeit steckengeblieben und hat die digitale Revolution und manches andere verschlafen. Er pr\u00e4sentiert mir als Leserin die Umwandlung von Club Med-artigen Ferienclubs in quasi Bordellclubs tats\u00e4chlich als Idee - doppelt laangweilig und genervt. Das letzte Potenzial der Geschichte verspielt er dann auch noch leichtfertig. Es w\u00e4re spannend gewesen zu sehen, wie sich diese auf Sex basierende Beziehung durch den Druck, st\u00e4ndig Neues und Sensationen zu erleben, indem man neue Sexpartner dazunimmt, nach und nach totl\u00e4uft. Aber nein - die b\u00f6sen Islamisten auf Krabi kommen und l\u00f6schen die gro\u00dfe Liebe durch einen religi\u00f6s motivierten Terroranschlag aus. Wie platt und klischeehaft ist das denn? Wundert mich sowieso, dass er in einem riesengro\u00dfen 90% buddhistischen Land, in dem sowas normalerweise niemanden kratzt, den Sexclub ausgerechnet in Krabi, einer kleinen Provinz positioniert, die einzige Gegend, in der die Bev\u00f6lkerung muslimisch ist. So ein d\u00e4mliches Management existiert wirklich nur in Houelles Kopf-Fiktion und geh\u00f6rt alleine schon aus unglaublicher Dummheit mit einer Kalaschnikov niedergem\u00e4ht. Fazit: Ein paar erz\u00e4hlerische St\u00e4rken, ansonsten absolut entbehrlicher Roman und h\u00f6chstenfalls nur als Onaniervorlage geeignet. ...more Graphic sex! Racism! Misogyny! Sex tourism!

(But wait! (view spoiler) [She dies in an Islamic terrorist attack! (hide spoiler) ] Isn't it nice how the misogyny and Islamophobia threads are both resolved in one fell swoop?). And on the topic of cocksucking, apparently it's A-OK as long as the cock in question is Michel's, otherwise it's proof that you're a little worthless slut. Michel knows nothing about Babette and L\u00e9a other than they are young and beautiful (like Val\u00e9rie), they wear revealing clothes (like Val\u00e9rie) and they went on the same packaged trip as him (like Val\u00e9rie). But Val\u00e9rie is sleeping with Michel, while Babette and L\u00e9a are not (they might even be -gasp- sleeping with other people!). That makes Val\u00e9rie a perfect angel of pleasure descended from the heavens, and L\u00e9a and Babette a pair of little cocksucking whores. Apparently it's Michel's cock that does the trick. I agree with Julian Barnes' review in that the sex in Platform is fundamentally pornographic. The women are all exceptionally attractive and skilled, and everyone is always in top form. It's glossy, performative and joyless. And of course the maid joins in. With all the controversy about the novel's content, before I read it I felt that not enough attention was being paid to the form. Now I know that it's because the writing itself is completely unremarkable (though it does have serious problems, like the poorly thought out and poorly executed point of view shifts). It's as if little thought was given to the actual craft of writing, in the rush of putting forward the \"controversial\" content (I can imagine Houellebecq's thread of thought as being something like: Pussy. Pussy. Pussy. Have I said \"pussy\" enough times? Am I outrageous yet? Pussypussypussy. Cock.) If I had to give a short assessment of Platform, its misogyny and Islamophobia are ultimately so unsubtle and cartoonish that they would hardly merit a mention. The book is so patently meant to offend that I can't bring myself to play into it and be offended. But I do find it criminally self-indulgent and poorly crafted, and that is what makes it not worth your time. ...more i'm really into this guy right now. he seems to hate everything, which i can appreciate. this had a surprising tenderness to it, in comparison to The Elementary Particles, even though there's plenty of bitter social critique. what i like most is Houellebecq's realization that the we in the West are like the declining Roman Empire. he's able to articulate this thesis through his characters but as well as through interjections on social theory. this book is not without flaws, in particular its stra i'm really into this guy right now. he seems to hate everything, which i can appreciate. this had a surprising tenderness to it, in comparison to The Elementary Particles, even though there's plenty of bitter social critique. what i like most is Houellebecq's realization that the we in the West are like the declining Roman Empire. he's able to articulate this thesis through his characters but as well as through interjections on social theory. this book is not without flaws, in particular its strange, pehaps simply lazy, changing of narrative perspective, but the central themes are uniquely provocative, and not in a leftist or right-wing way.

The structure of the novel (or semi-novel -- I'm not gonna criticize on the novelistic criteria of characterization or artfulness, cause Monsieur H doesn't seem to care much about those) is as follows. Here is a brief, spare page of narrative. Here are several pages of vigorous, loosely connected moral or political argument. Here is how the sunlight catches her labia as I pull her hips toward the open window. The protagonist's only joy seems to come in the sexy bits, and that's what pissed me off most, I think. Because this IS a fun book to read, due entirely (well, mostly: the sex is indeed hot, though in an unoriginal, mechanical way) to the forceful, often heretical opinions, but the narrator offers them up without the slightest pleasure or intellectual exhilaration, and it feels false. (Also false: the sex is never bad. The whores are angels, nobody's ever awkward or unhappy, a nubile, braless chambermaid just happens to be walking by.) Blah blah blah I could go on and on.

Or, they are highly successful in one or both of these struggles, can't handle the pressure, then turn to self descructive behaviour. I love it. I would like to refer to my friend Jean's review, who puts it very accurately http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... . I think the reason why Houellebecq's characters don't feel sympathetic is that, whereas usually a character would feel remorse or regret about his dark sides, Houellebecq's characters feel absolutely nothing. Filling in a form as a government officer to subsidise an artist exhibition is described and experienced in exactly the same way as the same guy visiting a Thai prostitute as a tourist. That's tough and hard to handle for our conditioned Western minds. One small difference between me and my friend's opinion: I love the bleak atmosphere in the book. O, and I like the violence. Of course. Houellebecq's violence has got a very Japanese horror movie feel to it (watch Ichi The Killer to see what I mean). It comes sudden, unannounced and is completely over the top.

What is it? Essentially, sociological investigation and provocation through the lens of the international tourism economy: I liked holiday brochures, their abstraction, their way of condensing the places of the world into a limited sequence of possible pleasures and fares. I was particularly fond of the star rating system, which indicated the intensity of the pleasure one was entitled to hope for. I wasn't happy, but I valued happiness and continued to aspire to it. According to the Marshall model, the buyer is a rational individual seeking to maximize his satisfaction while taking price into consideration; Veblen's model, on the other hand, analyzes the effect of peer pressure on the buying process (depending on whether the buyer wishes to be identified with a defined group opr to set himself apart from it). Copeland demonstrates that the buying process varies, depending on the category of product/service (impulse purchase, considered purchase, specialized purchase); but the Buadrillard and Becker model posits that a purchase necessarily implies a series of signals. Overall, I felt myself closer to the Marshall model. This is from near the start, where the prose seems most exceptional and refined, even in translation, where the deadened interior monologues of a middle-aged bureaucrat, a fundamentally repulsive non-person, are constantly intercut as above with statistical information and sociological data. He sounds like he could be a sociopath. It's harsh, hilarious, actually often piercing. It works. Almost every page we're blindsided by something like: \"On an intellectual level, I was suddenly capable of acknowledging the attractions of the Muslim vagina.\" The prose style evens out after that at a somewhat more modest level, but the book is nothing if not carefully composed and directed throughout. Houellebecq can write, and he doesn't shy away from anything here; much of the books provocation is actually of thought. That said, the seemingly fundamental value in the book is simply that of pleasure, presented (cynically? naively?) as the one remaining avenue of genuine human contact in an increasingly desensitized and alienated western world, a world which continues to export its failing ideals all over the globe. And so, there's a lot of sex. Strangely, Houellebecq's cold, almost brusque cataloguing of sex acts actually worked pretty effectively here. He didn't grasp at awkward flights of lyricism, doesn't fall into the numbing boredom of overzealous lengthy description. He keeps things concise and direct and somehow convinced me, almost sentimentally, of some kind of real connection taking place. This is a widely debated point, if we go by other reviews, but I found it all more empathetic than, say, the oddly artificial sex culminating The Girl Beneath the Lion (freshest in my mind since I read it last week). Valerie, in any event, seems a far more effectual and sympathetic human than our narrator, though their paths coincide. What exactly ties her to him isn't entirely clear, it is true, but was oddly unworried by this while actually reading. So anyway, sexual pleasure is presented as the ideal here, almost, certainly to the characters who draft marketing taglines like \"Pleasure is a right.\" I mean, shouldn't it be? Maybe? Does Houellebecq agree? Hard to say exactly, there're some terribly flawed social models here, unflinchingly presented, and though the social reformers are presented as unsympathetically as nearly everyone else, they also are \"vindicated\" in some way by actions that undercut everything else that has been built up. Throughout, Houellebecq's modeling of pleasure is precisely matched against apocalyptic social forces that the protagonists are inclined to utterly ignore as much as obliviously provoke. There's ambiguity as to what it all adds up to by inevitable finish, which deep analysis by others suggest is symptomatic of \"idealogical double-crossing\" and careful obfuscation of intent, but though I find it hard to disagree with Marie Redonnet here, I can't entirely dismiss Houellebecq as an asshole either. Or, if he's an asshole, he's one with talents, and possible uses. ... Strangely, only a day later, I'm having trouble recalling why this wasn't a more annoying or problematic book to me while I was actually reading it, but somehow it wasn't. ...more A vicious and incredibly bleak social critique that is as subtle and incendiary as a suicide bomber.

The novel is narrated by Michel, a pessimistic middle-aged man who, to his mind, lives in an era so corroded by consumerism, narcissism and terrorism that genuine human contact or happiness can only be obtained through the blissful abandon of sexual orgasm \u2013 even if it\u2019s with a stranger who will be accepting your cash afterwards. While vacationing in Thailand, Michel meets Val\u00e9rie, a younger woman of a similar disposition, and the two cynics begin an intense love affair. They gradually develop the idea of creating a chain of specialized tourist resorts that double as brothels, hoping to entice the (apparently) huge market of sexually frustrated jet-setters and retirees; in other words: sex tourism as a legitimate business enterprise. Using her executive status in the tourism industry and some clever marketing, among other things, Val\u00e9rie is able to bring the idea into reality quite easily -- and it turns out to be a tremendous success. However, no one is prepared for the dangers of corporate greed and religious extremism that follow, and the consequences cause everything to spin wildly out of control. For the most part, Platform is sharply written and morbidly entertaining, so these compliments are enough to earn it at least a cautious recommendation. On the other hand, the large number of explicit sex scenes becomes almost ridiculous after awhile, adding little more than overheated hetero-male fantasy to the proceedings. With all the fornication, was Houellebecq trying to dull within his readers the lascivious lure of sex, thereby strengthening the book\u2019s theme of the commodification of carnality in a discontented modern age? I don\u2019t think so \u2013 it came across as a misanthropic-but-lonely author getting his rocks off by jotting down erotic prose, masturbating furiously in the murky theater of his imagination while his projected fantasies flicker across the decaying screen. Along with the book\u2019s blatant anti-Islam sentiments, and its author\u2019s position as recent European literature\u2019s chief provocateur, maybe he just has an inherent need to create controversy any way he can. Still, again, I don\u2019t regret the unpleasant-but-brief time I spent reading this brutal work of his. ...more Picked this up out of curiousity, and I can see why he is such a hit in France.

I suspect M. Houellebecq is a huge C\u00e9line fan, and he probably likes Sade and Henry Miller as well. It's been a long time since I've read the latter two, however I do remember that within their sometimes hardcore delivery, there was some sensuality and wit, or, I don't know, skill. I think he was trying to be satirical, but it just doesn't come through. Instead, he comes off as a sullen teenager who didn't succeed in getting his curfew extended. M. Houellebecq, in my opinion, doesn't have the chops. The star's for the marketing coup. Good for him - we'll probably continue to see his mug on the extensive circuit of French talk shows that pander to those in his element. ...more Houllebecq is a dirty, dirty man.

Definirei la prima parte del romanzo estremamente angosciante. La depressione che affligge il protagonista traspare da ogni singola parola, virgola o punto. Nella seconda parte, invece, ecco che ci viene presentato il miracolo nella forma di Val\u00e9rie, una giovane donna perfetta sotto tutti i punti di vista: brillante nel lavoro, a letto e nella vita.

Non mi sento di sconsigliarne la lettura perch\u00e9, nonostante tutto, \u00e8 un romanzo scorrevole e la trama incuriosisce abbastanza. Non ho apprezzato gli inutili e pedanti riferimenti a personaggi del mondo francese della politica e dello spettacolo e ho considerato eccessive, in pi\u00f9 di qualche momento, le minuziose descrizioni degli atti sessuali. Se l'obiettivo di Houellebecq era quello di suscitare pena - e, a tratti, disgusto - nei confronti del suo protagonista, allora ci \u00e8 riuscito.

Val works for a tour company, and Michel makes a world-changing suggestion: run a world-wide series of hotels where first-world men and women can have sex with third-world men and women and their \"purer\" (his word, not mine) sexuality. Everyone benefits from the arrangement: the sex toured get money for practicing their weightless sexuality; the sex tourists get laid. In terms of its attitude towards the interior life of Asian persons, this makes \"The Quiet American\" look like \"The Joy Luck Club.\" I mean, Christ on a battery hen: at least Gaugin put spooky symbols in his backgrounds. Oh, and the whole arrangement is ruined by Muslims. And the book is dotted with Muslim spokespeople who handily explain how stupid Islam is.

A maid watches Mike and Val going at it, and wanders into the room herself, blouse a-flutter and nipples (his word) a-twitter. The main character reads Comte. There are sex clubs. This is all much less interesting than it sounds. I started this out of curiosity, and finished it out of spite. I would give it book one star, but that would make it sound more shocking or just reaction-getting than it is. I'm vaguely terrified that people take take this seriously--Wikipedia tells me there was a theater adaptation--or think that this Michel dude (same name, writer and main character, wink wink) has insights into postwhatever society. So one and a half stars for the breast and a half on the cover. It's a very nice breast and a half. Of course, this is French, so for all I know there's some subtle tone in the original which indicates that this is all some sort of sophisticated joke on the sort of person who would write a review like this. I can live with that. ...more I just finished this, and I'm not sure of what I think and how many stars to give...

A very subtle and cynical story of loneliness in these modern times, critique of what is wrong with the Western world today. I must agree with many of his views! \"I had an inkling that, more and more, the whole world would come to resemble an airport.\" \"We remember our lives, Schopenhauer wrote somewhere, as little better than a novel we once read. That\u2019s about right: a little, no more.\" \"I don't subscribe to the theory that we only become truly adult when our parents die; we never become truly adult.\" \"People drag their progeny around with them like a ball and chain, like some terrible deadweight that hinders their every move - and that, as often as not, effectively winds up killing them.\" \"For the manipulative masochists, it is not enough that he is unhappy; everyone else must be unhappy too.\" \"Culture seemed to me to be a necessary compensation for the misery of our lives. It was possible to imagine a different sort of culture, one bound up with celebration and lyricism, something that sprang from a state of happiness.\" \"She was one of those creatures who are capable of devoting their lives to someone else's happiness, of making that alone their goal. This phenomenon is a mystery. Happiness, simplicity, and joy lie within them, but I still do not know how or why it occurs. And if I haven't understood love, what use is it to me to have understood the rest?\" ...more Sprachlos...

After reading this novel, I confirm that Houellebecq is the kind of writers that is hard to find nowadays. He writes about how he see the world, he doesn't write what other want to read. Nowadays, most of the writers are just business man, trying to sell their books without compromise them selfs exposing a philosophy or and idea. Houellebecq just write what he thinks, analyzing the present, and projecting to the future. In Platform we can read strong compliments against occident, the European society, the capitalism, religions (Muslims and Christians). And It's funny to know that Houellebecq is accused of being a misogynist, but what he writes is that the world or it would be better to say, the Capitalism, is misogynist, the religion is misogynist. I can't really deal with the \"Good-thinker\" people, that don't try to understand what they read, they are just there to condemn all what can shock the society. But we need writer as Houellebecq, they are compromise with the world. Beside his misanthropy, he tries to expose why he \"hates\" the world. This is not a book just about sex, as The Elementary Particles, this is an analysis of our present world. ...more \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430. \u041c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0435. \u041d\u044f\u043c\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430. probably the worst houellebecq i've read, but still pretty good. a cynical bastard--but the guy can write. and, for social commentary, if you squint and look through the layers of provocation, it's not so shoddy an analysis. e.g. published a half decade before THE SHOCK DOCTRINE, houellebecq writes about a corporate office in suburban France: \"'It's strange,' he said to her.

I was in Sao Paulo once, now there's where evolution has really been pushed to its limits. It's not even a city anymore, it's sort of urban territory that extends as far as the eye can see, with its favelas, its huge office blocks, its luxury housing surrounded by guards armed to the teeth... Businessmen and rich people use helicopters to get around almost all the time, and there are helipads pretty much everywhere... At ground level the street is left to the poor--and the gangs\" (142). And near the end he writes, very straightforwardly: \"To the end, I will remain a child of Europe, of worry and of shame. I have no message of hope to deliver. For the west, I do not feel hatred. At most I feel a great contempt. I know only that every single one of us reeks of selfishness, masochism, and death. We have created a system in which it has simply become impossible to live, and what's more, we continue to export it\" (258). ...more Do te\u010f se mi je\u0161t\u011b nikdy nestalo, \u017ee bych musel ve vlaku p\u0159estat \u010dist, proto\u017ee za deset minut vystupuji a stoj\u00ed mi p\u00e9ro.
