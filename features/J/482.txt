So what's the problem? I can sum it up in two points: 1) Sam is a lame protagonist. 2) All the girls are 'cute'. Let me explain. Pointer number one: Sam is one of those over the top do-gooders that just don't exist in real life, let alone at fifteen. He is given too much credit for his age by the author and his character becomes increasingly unrealistic, Sam is essentially the very ideal stereotype of the 'good guy', the hero, the constant martyr for the greater good. Oh please, he's a fifteen year old guy in a town with no adults, he should be drinking like a fish and raiding the porn sections at the local stores. His self-pitying attitude also results in generating absolutely zero sympathy. Pointer number two: The girls of this novel are teeth-grindingly useless. Astrid the genius is Sam's 'beautiful' girlfriend and the dark and seductive Diana is Caine's obedient sidekick. Nearly all the females are trophies and repeatedly described as 'hot' or 'cute'. They also need protecting. There is way too much of this: And nowhere near enough of this: Whatever happened to the ass-kicking female? She isn't in this book. Other readers might point out characters like Brianna and Lana as examples of strong females. However, in the heat of battle when Brianna is required to be strong, she instead decides to run away and cook herself a pigeon. What the hell?? And Lana is not strong enough to defeat the lure of the 'Darkness' but rather leads the others into danger and needs to be rescued. By Sam, Caine and Duck (<---B>the male characters who come swooping in to rescue her</---B>), in fact. Also, most of the battle stuff is done man-to-man. Usually featuring Sam, Caine, Drake, Edilio, Orc and Jack; the girls tend to hide behind the rubble or are used to threaten their boyfriends (i.e. Caine threatening to kill Astrid unless Sam surrender). Seriously? Why are all the strongest mutants male, anyway? Is radiation that particular? After this great big rant, you're gonna be thinking - how the hell did it get 4 stars then? Well, it's a great story really. It's exciting and action-packed, there are always several sub-plots happening at once meaning that the book never gets slow or tiresome. Some of the characters are interesting and highly likeable and it's a good portrayal of growing up and the difficulties of being a teenager (only times by about a thousand). Every teenager should be reading this series, my only recommendation is that they follow it up with a large dose of Buffy The Vampire Slayer to remind themselves that having a vagina does not equal weak, pathetic damsel in distress. Quite the opposite at times. ...more The Gone series is the type of series that has you marking down your calendars waiting for the next installment.

Kids are literally starving and no one is helping out. Kids are being, well, kids. Lazy and waiting for someone to just hand them food on a silver platter. I adore Sam. My heart goes completely out to this fictional character. As he says during an argument, he's just fifteen and everyone is expecting him to be the dad. It's so much pressure and he's so very real because all he wants is pizza and a chance to make out with his girlfriend. He's so adult and yet so child-like at the same time. He doesn't want to make the decisions but everyone keeps coming to him for answers that he doesn't have. And it breaks him. My complete and most utter compliments to <---A>Michael</---A> Grant. The scene with Astrid and Sam in the dark where he finally unloads and breaks down got to me. I wanted to reach through the pages and clutch the poor kid to my bosom and tell him it was going to be alright. Of course I have no idea if it is going to be alright, but I wanted to give him some sort of assurance that he is not a failure and he's doing the best that he can and that's a very good thing. There was another scene that got to be. Like really got to me. When they're about to execute Hunter. It reminded me of The Handmaid's Tale where the Handmaidens are encouraged to execute by pulling a rope to hang someone. The entire basis of that scene was to show just how a crowd will degenerate if they are hungry enough. The promise of food is a strong, strong motivator. I have to say that this reminded me of a quote that I read in a Reader's Digest a very long time ago: \"Literature duplicates the experience of living in a way that nothing else can, drawing you so fully into another life that you temporarily forget you have one of your own. That is why you read it, and might even sit up in bed till dawn, throwing your whole tomorrow out of whack, simply to find out what happens to some people -- you know perfectly well -- are made up.\" -Barbara Kingslover I ran a gauntlet of emotions while reading this book.

Some people may say that this novel is unrealistic, or too built on the theme of finding weakness in others, but it shows taking on responsibility, even if it is unwanted. Sam Temple is one of the well crated characters in this book. He is a fifteen year old boy who is forced to become a leader of hundreds of kids, after every adult and teen ages fifteen and up in his town disappeared. He is overwhelmed with responsibilities like finding a way to feed every kid with food supply decreasing, and protecting people from the upcoming gangs. He is like any other teenager in this world. Readers can connect to him and eventually, feel what he feels. What distinguishes Sam from some other kids in his town are his powers. Right before the FAYZ, the time when the adults disappeared, many kids began to discover that they had unnatural powers like no one else. Sam\u2019s unique power was light. Not only could he create his own light but he could fire beams of heated light that could be used as a defense, or a weapon. The detail written about the setting and plot of this book is amazing. Its like reading a movie! There\u2019s action, romance, and the threat of life or death. The setting is described in a way that makes the reader feel like the action can be happening in their own city or town. It is a page turning book that makes you not want the story to end. How many people have been given a tough responsibility to handle? In this novel, Sam Temple and everyone else is faced with almost too many tasks to fulfill. He has to prevent arising gang violence, avoid being killed by his twin brother, This amazingly written novel is praised for its life like characters, the extremely detailed setting, and the theme of accepting difficult responsibilities. By the end of the story you will feel what the characters feel and wish there were more of the story to read. Everyone at some point in their lives has to take on.

Though not as good as GONE: too many different plots and points of view made this book kind of hectic. Michael Grant is definitely an author with a knack for action-driven stories heavy on suspense and excitement.

Hunger was therefor Pretty good! Though not as good as GONE: too many different plots and points of view made this book kind of hectic. Michael Grant is definitely an author with a knack for action-driven stories heavy on suspense and excitement. Gone was a great beginning book for the series: it established the problem (all growups \"poof\" out and leave kids to fend for themselves) and dealt with the power struggles that ensued between the townies and the dysfunctional delinquents over at Coates. Hunger was therefore able to go more in-depth on the problems of the FAYZ: three months have gone by, and supplies and food are drastically depleted. What was so cool about this book was that - while I was reading it - I forgot that I was reading a fictional sci-fi/fantasy thriller. I was so wrapped up in \"oh my gosh! what are they going to DO?!\" and really feeling all the agitation and the anxiety that the characters felt. I read this 500+ page thing in 2 days, lordy lord! That's pretty good for me! I seriously could not put it down. The (main) characters are all so incredibly dynamic. Just wanna give a quick shout-out to Dekka - I absolutely love her \"go get'em tiger\" personality. SHE needs to lead the FAYZ! Sam/Astrid and Caine/Diana went together very nicely - when I found myself annoyed at Sam and Astrid (and unfortunately, I did at times) I had Caine and Diana to balance the story out. Most of the main characters are portrayed in Hi-Def and so it made it incredibly easy to relate to them - the good guys and the not-so-good guys - and really care about what was going on with them. I personally find it really interesting that Grant has created an antagonist, Caine (cause technically that's what he is) that I actually care about. Maybe Caine's not bad enough - that's more like Drake - but I really enjoyed his scenes. He's such a megalomaniac, but perhaps a misunderstood megalomaniac? I will say, though, that characterization and plot, two things that Grant knows how to handle really well, got a little hectic in this installment. I *do* like the large ensemble cast of characters, BUT in this story, I think there were a little too many perspectives, too many characters to keep track of, and I think that sometimes scenes that really should have gone to the \"main characters\" (like Sam and Astrid) were spent on all these secondary characters. That's okay and everything, except that I frequently found myself not quite understanding why Sam, Astrid or Lana would do certain things. Also, if Sam and Astrid just got together at the end of Gone , it seems a little early (to me) for them to already be having problems. But then again, they didn't have very many scenes together, and the few scenes they did have together they spent bickering. Maybe the spotlight will be on them a little more in Lies . All I'm saying is that because the perspective was off them, I didn't really feel as connected to them as I did in the first book. Astrid in particular started to annoy me a bit. She's supposed to be a genius, so I found it odd that she was so hostile to Albert's economic ideas. If you're so smart, Astrid, why can't you see that it's a good thing to try and rebuild the economy? Maybe we should start referring to \"Astrid the Genius\" as \"Astrid the Commie.\" Just kidding! Caine and Diana, though, were great. They did get their bit of spotlight. The same characterization notice also applied to the plots, here. I think there were so many things going on in this particular installment, that they just didn't seem fully covered. There's a major food shortage in the FAYZ. Caine and gang are trying to make a big for power again. The Darkness wants to be fed. Something's up with Petey. Albert wants to keep the flame of capitalism alive. Lots of really cool plot points that didn't really seem to get an even amount of coverage. It's totally cool to have different things going on, but toward the end, things just seemed rushed. But anyway, another awesome installment to a new favorite series. I can't wait to get my hands on Lies . ...more Okay...I need to take a deep breath... This book was overwhelming!

In fact, everything seems to be going from bad to worse. Sam, the appointed leader of Perdido Beach, is feeling the pressure of all the day to day decisions. The biggest problem that everyone is facing is starvation. With the fear and confusion that followed the disappearance of everyone 15 and over, the kids that were left did what they wanted - including eating what they wanted. Nothing was done to preserve food for the future, so meats and vegetables went bad, leaving food in short supply. The kids in Perdido Beach and Coates Academy are left eating what canned food is left. One day it might be asparagus for breakfast, wax beans for lunch, and hot dog relish for dinner. No one is in good spirits and when Caine recovers from his encounter with The Darkness and makes another move for power, things only get worse. Sam is suffering from all the stress, Little Pete\u2019s powers are getting scarier every day, some of the kids that haven\u2019t developed powers are beginning to start trouble, and important people are switching sides. Danger is at its all time high. Death seems imminent. Michael Grant has produced a very satisfying sequel. The tension and excitement in the story is palpable. Character development continues to be a strong point. The new characters that are introduced add to the plot, but our favorites from GONE continue to play a large role in the story. HUNGER is the second book in a six-part series. Michael Grant is currently working on the third which will be titled LIES. HUNGER will be released June 2009, but be sure to read GONE first, you\u2019ll need the backstory to really appreciate the sequel. ...more Oh my god.

Definetly one of my better Sundays. \"Hunger\" is about... well, it's about a lot of things, but basically it all started in \"Gone\", the first book in the series, when all the people over the age of fourteen dissapeared.

There is just so much going on in this novel, I can't wrap my mind around it. There's hunger and starvation with food running out. There's a fight between kids with powers and kids without them. There's torture and mind games. There's love and revenge. Even eating disorders. And worst of all, there's a lurking darkness in the midst of all the horrible drama. And the darkness is hungry. If you have to read one book during the entire summer, read \"Gone\". Then, right after you're done with Gone, read \"Hunger\". Oh wait, I said one book... well whatever, just read the series! It's amazing, mind-blowing, phenomonal, just pure writing at it's best. Michael Grant is a huge talent and I'm surprised that he's just getting discovered. The only bad thing is waiting to see what happens next. Now I'm hungry... for the next book in the series! ...more Someone told me that Hunger is not as great as Gone.

There's always a huge thing happening in one place, at the same time on another place and sometimes also in an another different place. The action scenes are really non-stop that sometimes you have to stop reading and remind yourself to breath. The only problem I got while reading it was there is a freaking huge number of characters. And it was really confusing at first cause there are characters that has somehow a similar name like Brianna and Brittney, Harry, Hunter and Hank, etc.. There are just a lot of characters that I even made my own top ten favorite characters for this particular book.(Posted here ). I guess the only weak point of the book is Sam and Astrid. They are too self-righteous and pretentious that at one point, they seem to be fake. Their romance is also weak, its too controlled and a little sappy. And for real Sammy boy,?? you are using \"Babe\" to call Astrid? How cheesier can that be.! Its a little evil but I somehow been glad when Astrid got hit and Sam was whipped. I think they deserve it to wake them up, step up their game and stop trying to be saints. Don't get me wrong, I sympathize Sam when he breaks down but he desperately needs to be a badass to redeem himself. I hope Michael Grant can redeem these two characters since they are the leads. I really loved this book and I am eager to read LIES that I just bought over the weekend. But somehow I think I need to read something else first so that I wouldn't get the impression that HUNGER and LIES are not the same thing. And boy oh boy! Chips, burgers and pizza tastes even better after reading Hunger. lol. :) ...more And this is where the plot diverges from the paths of things like Under the Dome -- where that book lasted only about a week, Hunger jumps ahead three months into their isolated bubble, with no end in sight.

The kids are starving, literally dying from starvation unless they can manage to work together and cooperate and rebuild a sustainable society/economy. (Once again, this touches on my love of survival logistics and resource management!! I blame a childhood growing up on strategy games like Warcraft/Age of Empires, plus city simulators. I seriously just love reading books where people have to fuss over the arguably banal details of survival and running a society.) But the title also applies to the Darkness' hunger, a motif that runs throughout the whole book as you slowly find out more about the malevolent presence haunting the town of Perdido Beach. There's also the weight of responsibility which piles and piles and piles on Sam's shoulders now, being the leader for 300+ kids that he never asked for. Again with my usual Animorphs comparisons: it took Jake much much much longer to crack and splinter under the strain , but it actually makes sense to me. Because Sam has more lives resting directly on his shoulders, more weird real-world logistical issues to sort out (how do you plant crops!?), and then also immature kids bringing him totally pointless problems & petty disagreements as if he's their parent. I would want to dropkick some of those children into the Pacific ocean, tbh. Small sidebar: a scene in the very first chapter alone merits this book the \"nightmare fuel\" tag, because I have a serious thing about (view spoiler) [worms burrowing into skin (hide spoiler) ] . I can't deal. The exact same thing also happened in one of the earlier Remnants books, too, so hey, Mr. Grant, I'M ONTO YOU. And now that I'm two books in, I'm attached to the characters! Super-spoilery thoughts: (view spoiler) [I was devastated when I thought Edilio was dead. His and Sam's found-brothers dynamic is so great in its complete, absolute trust and loyalty ( Don't die on me --I'm actually starting to slash ship it, what is happening). Brianna is spunky and wonderful, and Dekka's a badass, and I love that she calls out straight white Sam for not having the same POV on othering that she does as a black lesbian. Astrid's relationship with her little brother remains complex & interesting as always. And Caine and Diana. I love them I love them I need fic for them!! I ship it so hard! Also, Caine's grief & about-turn & helping them out at the end was fantastic; really, all I want from this series is a long-term redemption arc for him. It feels like that's what Grant is going for, so I'm excited to see where this goes. And fine, Quinn has now grown on me. I also really liked Lana's lil' monologue about the effect of the Gaiaphage on her, and gosh but my heart clenched at her dumb heroic attempt to take it down. They were such good character moments: \u201cI am Lana Arwen Lazar. My dad was into comic books, so he named me Lana for Superman\u2019s girlfriend Lana Lang. And my mom added Arwen for the elf princess in The Lord of the Rings. And I never, ever do what I\u2019m told.\u201d LOVE. <3 However, the narrative has a tendency to send her off on adventures by herself or sideline her for long periods, which means it's a bit harder to get a grasp on her too. (hide spoiler) ] And a few thoughts about the ending: (view spoiler) [DUUUUUUUUUUCK. :( I found myself stricken on the subway, wanting to cry about a minor character who I never expected to have that many Feelings over. His last moments, ugh. And the Big Bad is banished -- but surely the Gaiaphage will come back, though, right? It's too big of an ~endgame~ villain to waste, I feel like. Although with the buildup of the mutants v. normals tension and violence, and the next book being called Lies , I'm assuming their enemies in the next book will be themselves, and will be their population splitting into factions and tearing each other apart. My only quibble -- the thing preventing it from being a five-star book for me -- is that the characters got off pretty scott-free this time. All of the characters I had straight-up given up for dead -- Edilio, Dekka, Diana, Lana, even Sam, as I had a moment of thinking \"man it would be a cool move to kill off the leader in the second book\" -- were brought back, thanks to Lana's power. I feel like there should have been more consequences from the tumultuous climax; right now, the characters feel sheltered by the protective arm of the narrative, if that makes any sense? As in, to be truly all bets are off!!!! , I kind of wanted someone to die, even if it would have hurt my heart for it to happen. Confrontations without real in-universe risk of death aren't true confrontations at all. (hide spoiler) ] I don't want to say that much about the book outside of the cut-tags, because, again, spoilers! But I liked this one a lot. I've already bought the next book, and had to restrain myself from diving right into it (and distracting myself with some fluffy dragon fantasy instead). This is turning out to be a solid dystopian YA series ( with superpowers ), with really gritty visceral violence and the struggles of running a nascent society built on the backs of wastrel youths... and best of all, a premise that isn't your cut-and-dried autocratic dystopia with plucky anti-government rebellion.

Battles had damaged the fa\u00e7ade of the main building.

The kids had made an effort to keep the elements out by duct-taping sheets of plastic over the holes, but the tape had loosened and now the plastic and the tape hung limp, stirring with the occasional breeze. The building looked as if it had been through a war. It had been. *** Sam tried to sleep. Wanted desperately to sleep. He was in the spare bedroom at Astrid and Mary and John\u2019s house. In the dark. On his back. Staring up at the ceiling. Downstairs, in the kitchen, there were a half dozen cans of food. He was hungry. But he had had his ration for the day. He had to set the example. Still, he was hungry, and the hunger didn\u2019t care about setting an example. Food downstairs. And Astrid down the hall. A different kind of hunger, that. And there, too, he had to set a good example. I am nothing but good examples, he told himself gloomily. *** \u201cWhat am I supposed to do? Tell three hundred kids spread out in seventy or eighty different homes that they can\u2019t watch DVDs? Confiscate iPods?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not easy playing daddy to three hundred kids,\u201d Astrid admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not anyone\u2019s daddy,\u201d Sam practically snarled. Another sleepless night, in a long string of them, had left him in a foul mood. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be the mayor, not the father.\u201d \u201cThese kids don\u2019t know the difference,\u201d Astrid pointed out. \u201cThey need parents. So they look to you. And Mother Mary. Me, even, to some extent.\u201d Little Pete chose that moment to begin floating in the air. Just lifted off a foot, eighteen inches, hovered there, his arms floating, toes pointed downward. Sam noticed immediately. Astrid didn\u2019t. \u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d *** Astrid started to say something, but stopped herself. She took a couple of calming breaths. Then, in a more measured tone, she said, \u201cSam, I figured you had enough on your shoulders. I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d He dropped his hands to his sides. His voice dropped as well. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d \u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Astrid said. \u201cYou don\u2019t sleep. You never have a minute to yourself. You act like everything that goes wrong is your fault. You\u2019re worried.\u201d \u201cYeah, I\u2019m worried,\u201d he said. \u201cLast night we had a kid who killed and ate a cat. The whole time he\u2019s telling me about it he\u2019s weeping. He\u2019s sobbing. He used to have a cat himself. He likes cats. But he was so hungry, he grabbed it and . . .\u201d Sam had to stop. He bit his lip and tried to shake off the despair that swept over him. \u201cAstrid, we\u2019re losing. We\u2019re losing. Everyone is . . .\u201d He looked at her and felt tears threaten. \u201cHow long before we have kids doing worse than killing cats?\u201d When Astrid didn\u2019t answer, Sam said, \u201cYeah, so I\u2019m worried. *** \u201cYou know, we should have hung out more, back in the old days,\u201d Howard said to Albert. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know I existed, back in the old days,\u201d Albert said. \u201cWhat? Come on, man. There\u2019s, like, a dozen brothers in the whole school and I didn\u2019t notice one?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re the same shade, Howard. That doesn\u2019t make us friends,\u201d Albert said coolly. Howard laughed. \u201cYeah, you were always a grind. Reading too much. Thinking too much. Not having much fun. Good little family boy, make your momma proud. Now look at you: you\u2019re a big man in the FAYZ.\u201d Albert ignored that. He wasn\u2019t interested in reminiscing. Not with Howard, for sure, not really with anyone. The old world was dead and gone. Albert was all about the future. *** Lana lay her hand against the gruesome hole. \u201cDon\u2019t want no more rock,\u201d Orc repeated. The bleeding stopped almost immediately. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d Lana asked. \u201cI mean the rock. I know the hole hurts.\u201d \u201cNo. It don\u2019t hurt.\u201d Orc slammed his fist against his opposite arm, hard enough that any human arm would have been shattered. \u201cI barely feel it. Even Drake\u2019s whip, when we was fighting, I barely felt it.\u201d Suddenly he was weeping. Tears rolled from human eyes onto cheeks of flesh and pebbles. \u201cI don\u2019t feel nothing except . . .\u201d He pointed a thick stone finger at the flesh of his face. \u201cYeah,\u201d Lana said. Her irritation was gone. Her burden was smaller, maybe, than Orc\u2019s. Lana pulled her hand away to see the progress. The hole was smaller. Still crusted with blood, but no longer actively bleeding. She put her hand back in place. \u201cJust a couple minutes more, Orc.\u201d \u201cMy name\u2019s Charles,\u201d Orc said. \u201cIs it?\u201d \u201cIt is,\u201d Howard confirmed. [...] \u201cWhat were you guys doing going into the worm field?\u201d Lana asked. Howard shot a resentful look at Albert, who answered, \u201cOrc was picking cabbage.\u201d \u201cMy name\u2019s Charles Merriman,\u201d Orc repeated. \u201cPeople should call me by my real name sometimes.\u201d *** \u201cI have nightmares,\u201d he said. \u201cThe battle. You know. The big battle.\u201d \u201cYou were really brave. You saved those kids in the day care.\u201d \u201cNot all of them,\u201d Quinn said shortly. He fell silent for a moment, back in the dream. \u201cThere was this coyote. And this kid, right? And . . . and . . . Okay, so I could have shot him, maybe, a little sooner, right? But I was scared of hitting the kid. I was so scared I\u2019d hit that little kid, so I didn\u2019t shoot. And then it was, like, too late. You know?\u201d Lana nodded. She didn\u2019t show any sympathy, and strangely Quinn thought that was a good thing because if it wasn\u2019t you, and you hadn\u2019t been there, and you hadn\u2019t been holding a machine gun with your finger frozen on the trigger, and you hadn\u2019t heard your voice coming out of your throat in a scream like an open artery, and you hadn\u2019t seen what he had seen, then you didn\u2019t have a right to be sympathetic because you didn\u2019t understand anything. You didn\u2019t understand anything. Anything. Lana just nodded and put her palm against his heart and said, \u201cI can\u2019t heal that.\u201d *** \u201cDiana will give me Jack,\u201d Caine said. \u201cAnd then we will turn off the lights and feed the\u2014\u201d He stopped very abruptly. He blinked in confusion. \u201cFeed?\u201d Drake echoed, puzzled. Caine almost didn\u2019t hear him. His brain seemed to trip, to skip a step, like a scratch in a DVD when the picture pixilates for a moment before starting up again. The familiar grounds of Coates Academy swam before his eyes. Feed? What had he meant? Who had he meant? \u201cYou can all go,\u201d he said, distracted. *** It felt like someone had a rope wrapped around his brain. Someone he couldn\u2019t see, someone standing far off in the dark, invisible. The rope disappeared into gloom and mystery, but at this end it was attached to him. And out there, the Darkness held the other end. Yanked it whenever it liked. Like Caine was a fish on a hook. *** Edilio looked at the shocked faces of the kids around him. He had been seconds away from impatiently ordering them into the field. Most wearing sneakers. None with experience seeing what the zekes looked like. He\u2019d been one hesitation away from ordering forty-nine kids to their deaths. \u201cGet back on the bus,\u201d Edilio said shakily. \u201cGet back on the bus.\u201d \u201cWhat about lunch?\u201d someone asked. *** She went out into the night looking for a kid who was very strong\u2014and, she hoped, very weak. *** Dekka watched him go. \u201cEdilio\u2019s a good guy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut?\u201d \u201cBut, he\u2019s a normal.\u201d \u201cThere aren\u2019t going to be lines like that, between freak and normal,\u201d Sam said firmly. Dekka almost, but didn\u2019t quite, laugh. \u201cSam, that\u2019s a great concept. And maybe you believe it. But I\u2019m black and I\u2019m a lesbian, so let me tell you: From what I know? Personal experience? There are always lines.\u201d *** The memories of the battle\u2014those couldn\u2019t even be called memories because weren\u2019t memories something from the past? That day might have happened three months ago, but it wasn\u2019t the past to Quinn, it was right here, right now, always. Like a parallel life happening simultaneously with this life. He was driving through the night and feeling the gun buck buck buck in his hands and seeing the coyotes and the kids, all mixed up together, all crisscrossing, weaving through the arcs of the bullets. *** The crowd was dead quiet now. Of course they were quiet, some still-functioning part of his mind thought bitterly, it\u2019s entertaining watching someone melt down in public. *** \u201cIf there\u2019s a God, I wonder if he\u2019s sitting in the dark on the end of his bed wondering how he managed to screw everything up.\u201d *** \u201cAnd what are you, Astrid?\u201d he shouted. \u201cA smug know-it-all! You point your finger at me and say, \u2018Hey, Sam, you make the decisions, and you take all the heat.\u2019\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s my fault? No way. I didn\u2019t anoint you.\u201d \u201cYeah, you did, Astrid. You guilted me into it. You think I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re all about? You used me to protect Little Pete. You use me to get your way. You manipulate me anytime you feel like it.\u201d *** He smiled, patted Drake\u2019s gaunt cheek, and with a hint of his old swagger said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to reshuffle the deck. Sam thinks he holds all the cards. But we\u2019re going to change everything.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to feed the monster who has his hooks in your head,\u201d Diana said coldly. \u201cDon\u2019t try to dress it up. We\u2019re feeding a monster and hoping it will show its gratitude by letting go of your leash.\u201d \u201cLet it go, Diana,\u201d Caine said. The bluster was gone. Diana glanced to see that Drake was out of earshot. \u201cBug\u2019s not coming back. You know that.\u201d Caine chewed at his thumb. Jack had the unsettling thought that he might be hungry enough to eat his own finger. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Caine said. \u201cHe might have had trouble finding Orsay. He wouldn\u2019t turn against me.\u201d \u201cNo one\u2019s loyal to you, Caine,\u201d Diana said. \u201cDrake is itching to take you down. No one at Coates is rushing to bail you out. You only have one person who actually cares about you.\u201d \u201cYou?\u201d Diana didn\u2019t answer. \u201cI know it has a hold on you, Caine. I\u2019ve seen it. But that monster of yours isn\u2019t loyal to you, either. It will use you and throw you away. It will be everything and you will be nothing.\u201d *** \u201cI\u2019m going to deal with Caine. I have to stop him here.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go at Caine and Drake by yourself,\u201d Edilio objected. \u201cNo way. I\u2019m not letting you kill yourself.\u201d Sam forced a laugh. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it. Howard, as soon as you get to town, find Breeze if you don\u2019t pass her on the way. If you don\u2019t find Brianna, find Taylor. Tell them to send help. And tell them I need someone to let me know what\u2019s going on with you guys at the mine.\u201d \u201cMaybe should have turned on the phones, huh?\u201d Edilio said. He winced, realizing too late that it sounded like sniping. Sam said, \u201cYeah. Add that to the list of mistakes I\u2019ve made lately.\u201d \u201cYeah, here\u2019s one not to make, Sam: don\u2019t go in there by yourself.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t I just say I wouldn\u2019t?\u201d Sam said evenly. Edilio looked him in the eyes. Sam looked down and said, \u201cBut in case anything happens to me, you all take orders from Edilio.\u201d Dekka nodded solemnly. \u201cDo not do that to me,\u201d Edilio said. \u201cDo not die on me, Sam.\u201d (view spoiler) [ (hide spoiler) ] (hide spoiler) ] ...more 3.5 stars.

First off, Astrid and Sam . As for their relationship, I still don't really believe it. This was something I had said for Gone and I still say it here. They feel more like friends than anything romantic. Overall, I liked Astrid less in this book than in Gone. I'm not sure what it was about her, I just didn't really care about her. Sam was fine, I liked him as much as in Gone. He's definitely more at a breaking point, but I can't say I blame him! Caine, Drake, and Diana Basically, they are as cynical and evil as ever. There were brief points where I almost felt bad for Caine and Diana but not overly so. And Drake is crazy as ever. (view spoiler) [ I also highly doubt that Drake is dead. That was too easy. (hide spoiler) ] All other characters I like Edillio but I think he is a bit forgettable. He's in the book quite a bit yet I still haven't found him remarkable in any way. The same goes for Dekah for me. I did like Brianna in this book and (view spoiler) [ hope to see more between her and Jack. Although, Jack annoyed me by going back with Diana and Caine with how mean they were to him and how badly they treated him. (hide spoiler) ] Orc and Howard were pretty much the same to me as in Gone. Orc seems, maybe, like he's trying to be better overall though. I'm not sure how to feel about Albert at this point. I really like him in Gone but it could go either way for me on him. We'll see how it plays out. I thought Zil and Harry were crazy and I'm sure we haven't seen the last of them yet. In case Drake and Caine aren't enough, let's add these lunatics! The three most intersting secondary characters to me were Duck, Hunter, and Brittney. (view spoiler) [ I felt so bad for Duck and Hunter! I really hope Duck is not dead and I feel bad that Hunter got exiled! I hope he is able to come back at some point. (hide spoiler) ] I am really interested to see what role Brittney has in future books! Petey also is having some crazy dreams! I feel like he's going to play a big key role towards the end of the series with something. I'm interested to find out what it is.

Sometimes I do have to remind myself they're all 15 and under, the way some of them act makes me be like oh my god you're far too young but at the same time I'm sure they'll have had to grow up in a sense very quickly. Didn't absolutely love it but was definitely an enjoyable read and I'll be continuing the series. ...more I think Lana is the best character so far. Very strong personality and strong will.

First off, let me say that I am writing this at 3 in the morning. Please forgive any grammar mistakes or lack of coherency. Okay, so this was a reread. I like rereading books that I've enjoyed, and I wanted to reread the first two before reading the next two in the series. Although it may be a while before I get to read those. Anyways. It went a lot slower for me, this time, than the first time. I'm not saying it wasn't gripping, exactly; once I'd start reading it again, I'd get hooked. But when I First off, let me say that I am writing this at 3 in the morning. Please forgive any grammar mistakes or lack of coherency. Okay, so this was a reread. I like rereading books that I've enjoyed, and I wanted to reread the first two before reading the next two in the series. Although it may be a while before I get to read those. Anyways. It went a lot slower for me, this time, than the first time. I'm not saying it wasn't gripping, exactly; once I'd start reading it again, I'd get hooked. But when I had free time, when I could've easily picked it up and read, I didn't have the desire. It didn't pull at me. I really like the Gone series. It's an extremely unique idea; intriguing, powerful, intricate, horrifying, incredibly dark. Action and gore and power plays and war. So refreshing when compared to a lot of YA these days. But the perspectives. Oh G-d, the perspectives. I missed a few on my one status update. There were not 18 perspectives. There were 21 perspectives. Now I'm sorry, but that's just ridiculous. Yes, I realize that the majority of these perspectives were somewhat necessary, that they told important parts of the plot, but G-d . . . 21? I know there are at least a few he could easily have chopped without hurting the book. As it is, I'd find myself really getting into one person's POV, and then their section ends, and I don't get to read about them again for a few chapters. That was incredibly frustrating. Then there are the characters themselves. Some of the characters I love. Caine, Diana, Lana, Orc, Edilio, Dekka, Duck. But some of the characters, some of the \"good\" characters, annoyed the shit out of me. Sam, our hero Sam. Sometimes I really liked him. Sometimes I wanted to punch him in the face. Astrid, the hero's girlfriend. She's supposed to be a genius, but honestly, most of the time I just see a stuck-up girl using big words. She did not appeal to me. There were a few other characters I was a bit iffy on as well. Also, I found an uncomfortable amount of typos. Editors, icu. That aside, it was a very, very good book. I'm so amazed at Grant's ability to construct these incredibly intricate plots and keep it all together, lead it all to a certain point, a fitting conclusion. Like I said before, it's so incredibly unique, and once I really got into the action, I couldn't tear myself away. Some have complained about Grant's very choppy, dramatic writing style, but I think it's absolutely perfect for these books. My problems with the perspectives and characters left me unable to rate this a five star, but it is a very solid four star. I really like this series, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys dark, action-filled stories with sci-fi, mutations, and a lot of horror. ...more I gave this book 4 and 1/2 Stars! Overall this book was pretty good. It's the sequel to gone and it is centered around this town where one moment adults are there,the next poof, gone! Everyone over the age of 15 just disappears.

I gave the first book gone five stars and gave its sequel only four an half stars!But before I tell you what I don't like about the book I'm gonna tell you what I did like about this book. I really loved all that character development in this book. All of the characters seem to have developed new strengths and weaknesses. You see the truth behind them and their flaws that they have tried to hide.The characters are becoming smarter than most adults are now! Their even smarter then I am, I mean I'm 16 and these kids are 14 and younger! I love Sam, Astrid and Edilio but I also have taken a liking to side characters Brianna and Dekka. Brianna stands for\" the breeze \" has an awesome power, as you can probably guess easily is going as fast as the breeze. I really like her attitude her sass and how funny she is. She just seems like the kind of person who'd be your best friend. Dekka on the other hand is also a fun character, she can levitate things with her mind, who doesn't love that? She is another person who could very easily be your best friend but she she seems like the type of friend that will be honest with you about anything and that's why I love Dekka. I also found it so fascinating that everyone found something they're magically good at. Which again is surprising considering there all 15 and under. Also brings up my next point. Everyone in this book acts so mature. Mary who is running the day care seems to much older but she can't be more than 15 years old. Sam is getting so much pressure from his new job as mayor I feel so stressed about it with him. I guess the kids don't understand that another kid is ruling this world full of kids. I guess none of them ever had to be in his shoes before. Again I really enjoyed this book but I just couldn't give it five stars. I'm not sure if it was some of the characters like Albert that are making mad, causing me to not like them anymore. It's like Albert became underdeveloped, he went backwards, like instead of becoming a better character he became worse. Anyway this is still a fun, sadish, gross and entertaining book and a great sequel! Can't Wait to read the next book! ...more \"Superpowers don't always make you a superhero.\" It's been 3 months since all the adults disappeared. Gone. But Perdido Beach has even more major problems.

And new mutants will be introduced: Dreamers, density, etc. I also loved how he ended it on a good note. It's nice to have a comic relief scene after all that action and dark times. This is one good book that you wouldn't wanna miss. Will the kids be fed, or will they die because of HUNGER? ...more I really enjoyed this follow-up to Gone. Hunger had just as much excitement, chaos, and action as its predecessor, with a little bit more characterization. I loved how the main character, Sam Temple, evolved in this book.

Despite this, however, Sam still manages to keep himself together enough to deal with all of the issues going on in the FAYZ, including the new problem of the mutants versus normals, which emerges in this book. I only had one problem with Hunger, and that would be that the ending didn't seem very realistic to me. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but... **minor spoiler**the ending seemed all wrapped up with a neat little bow. Basically, what I'm saying is that, in the end, all the main characters turned out okay, even though all of them at one point had been in a life-or-death situation. I was expecting at least one of them to kick the bucket, at least one of the minor major characters (a bit of an oxymoron, I know). I mean after everything that happened, it just felt a little off to me that they all could walk away from it. **end spoiler**. Overall, Hunger was definitely a worthwhile read. If you enjoyed the first book in the series, I'd recommend that you check out the second. If you're a fan of sci-fi, make sure to check out this series! ...more Hmmm I thought the book was ok. It definitely starts out with a horrifyingbang though! In the middle however, I felt like giving up (like the characters) mostly because I guess I was frustrated by the characters' failures when fighting against Caine and co.

I couldn't stand the HG's stupidity, but of course, it is necessary since it the normal/freak issue would come up eventually. I nearly gave up, but plowing through to read the ending was worth it. It wrapped up nicely, but at the same time, set up questions to be answered in the third book. side note: One thing I really like about these books is the diversity of the characters. Being an Asian myself, I like seeing Asian characters in a book since in all the YA books I've read, only a couple have had an Asian play an important role. ...more Second in the series, this book takes up where the first left off and intensifies the crisis.

There used to be a spooky saying that once committed to it, women were the fiercest, least sympathetic warriors, well kids make the meanest, most believeable villains, perhaps because there's much recognizeable truth in their willingness to cause chaos for chaos sake without respect to anyone else's feelings. Kids also make the best psychopaths. Any way you slice it, this book is a good engrossing read. ...more Three months have passed since the end of Book 1 (Gone), and things are getting desperate for the kids left in Perdido Beach. They're starving, and to say that they're not getting along with each other is putting it mildly. This second book does not disappoint, and while there's definitely some closure, there are a lot of questions left unanswered - like, WHAT is going on with Brittney?! I'm really looking forward to book 3. \"Superpowers,\" he said to himself,\"don't always make you a superhero.\" eesh, that was painful. It's a good story with interesting characters. but in the end, it's just a whole GRIP of kids making bad decisions. And it's just hard to read. Hard to witness. I loved this book so much!! It was amazing and so entertaining.

As such I had high hopes that the second book would build on and reach that potential. The second book effectively continues on from where the first left off. Sam continues as the somewhat unwilling teenage leader of the main band of children at Perdido Be When I read Gone, the preceding book to this one in Michael Grant's series, I was of the opinion that the book itself was decent enough, but clearly had a great deal of potential in terms of the characters and plot that Grant had put in place. As such I had high hopes that the second book would build on and reach that potential. The second book effectively continues on from where the first left off. Sam continues as the somewhat unwilling teenage leader of the main band of children at Perdido Beach, supported by a varied cast of other kids of varying ages. Meanwhile Caine, Sam's brother, has recovered from his ordeal at the end of the previous book and now seeks to lead the other group of kids at Coates School, including the beautiful yet manipulative Diana, and the utterly psychotic Drake. Yet in a mine outside of Perdido Beach, the mysterious creature that we were introduced to in the last book continues to make its own plans. Given the title of the book, it will come as no surprise that one of the main aspects of the plot this time around is that food is running out in and around Perdido Beach. Yet this plot is far from one dimensional, and the number of strands to it is truly impressive. Grant has created a large, varied and distinct cast of characters in this series, which are defined by distinct personalities as well as they are by the powers that some of them have. It is a worthy achievement that such a cast has been assembled in a manner that allows the reader to easily keep track of distinct characters with little effort. But if that is an achievement worthy of note within the book, the true triumph is how the different strands of the plot intertwine, and how the involvement of the characters within the book is dealt with. The first couple of hundred pages of the book are a style of scene setting, but not in a manner that is dull. In fact quite the opposite; Grant effectively inserts a number of set pieces early on that keep matters moving whilst the ground work for the climax of the story are put into place. Yet that 'climax' isn't twenty or thirty pages long; it is in fact a meticulously paced piece of story telling that takes place over the entire second half of the book. The number of different themes and aspects of the plot represent an ambitious approach from Grant. Not content with telling the story of a battle for resources between two rival factions, he also tells stories about kids trying to set up a system of business and reinvent capitalism, kids becoming prejudiced against those with powers, and even a kid with an eating disorder. These strands are pitched perfectly, and crucially the characters in this book act and react as one would expect children to do in their situation. The end result is that Grant has penned a story that is interesting, shocking, exciting, and perfectly paced. Ultimately Hunger is an excellent book that, to my mind, propels this series up a fair few notches in terms of quality from what was a solid debut in Gone. The ending of Hunger is more defined than in Gone, and as such I will approach the third book in the series with an amount of intrigue as well as expectation. On the quality of this book, Grant is under some pressure to strike a level of consistency with his next offering. ...more I didn't want to re-read GONE before diving into HUNGER, but Grant did a good job and throwing in comments throughout the book as needed to remind me what happened in the previous book, who had what powers, what some of the kids learned or suspected about the FAYZ, etc. I didn't feel like I was lost and I didn't feel like I was pulled out of the story and given a recap of what I needed to remember. So, good job. This was a really interesting part of the story. I enjoyed it as much or maybe a litt I didn't want to re-read GONE before diving into HUNGER, but Grant did a good job and throwing in comments throughout the book as needed to remind me what happened in the previous book, who had what powers, what some of the kids learned or suspected about the FAYZ, etc. I didn't feel like I was lost and I didn't feel like I was pulled out of the story and given a recap of what I needed to remember. So, good job. This was a really interesting part of the story. I enjoyed it as much or maybe a little better than GONE for the most part. There were lots of different story lines being continued or new ones introduced and it was cool to see them start to come together. It was also interesting to see the lesson on capitalism and economics told here, especially since Grant writes political stuff under a different name. This book was just a little bit too long. I know, can you believe I said that? I LOVE long books. But this one was dragging a bit at the end when I should have been turning pages as fast as I could. I found myself skip-reading just to find out what happens instead of being engrossed in every word. At 590 pages, it was probably about 100 pages too long in my opinion. This book in the series reveals some interesting stuff. I am curious where the story is going to go in the next 4 books. At least with Harry Potter you had a clue that each book would represent a different school year, you expected Harry to encounter Voldemort in some way, but also knew that each of the years would be teaching Harry what he needed to know to be prepared for the ultimate showdown with He Who Must Not Be Named! But with this series it's not clear how fast time is going to move and how each book will advance the story. So, yeah. It will be interesting to see what happens next. ...more", "Title": "Hunger"},
