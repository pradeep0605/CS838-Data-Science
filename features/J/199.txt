I really enjoyed these stories; although the characters are linked together through The Recreative Theatre Company each chapter is able to be read as a stand alone story.The characters are well developed and interesting. There are many themes here besides that of seduction; jealousy, love, domination and manipulation to name just a few. I like the way in which many of the women in these stories are strong, independent characters. They know what they want and are not afraid to try and get it. There is much humour here too; such as in The Video, where Colin's viewing pleasure is abruptly cut short,<---M> and Business Prospects</---M>, where an unexpected phone call interrupts the proceedings. One of my favourite stories is Missing Journals. The story is set in the early 20th Century and the setting is Brazil. There is an air of menace running throughout, the story is atmospheric and unsettling and will stay with you long after you've finished reading. This volume contains thought provoking, fascinating stories and I highly recommend it. ...more The erotic scenes in this second book are just as mind blowing as the first. You won't be disapointed! There's threesomes, voyeurism, group sex and straight sex. I felt sorry for Colin in The Video, being completely dominated by his scary wife, Samantha. I liked the story Garden Centre where Lucy has a very enjoyable time in the garden. Missing Journals is very, very steamy featuring a scary older woman with a group of young men.

Nothing is left to the imagination!La Belle Charente is a dark story because it's about a completely mad woman called Nicole who decides to seduce her husband's nephew. She'll stop at nothing to get what she wants.All very interesting stories. ...more I started reading this as soon as I finished Book One and this is just as good. the final story, La Belle Charente, for me,is the stand out story.This is a fascinating portrayal of a monster; a woman so manipulative, cunning and lacking in feelings that she'll take your breath away. in contrast, there is much humour in the other stories; The Video, in particular, made me laugh and I like the clever ending of Business Prospects. An extremely enjoyable read.<---A>James Sillwood</---A><---C>James Sillwood</---C><+++>Sensual Desires</+++>", "Title": "Sensual Desires"},
