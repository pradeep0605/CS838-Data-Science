I had no idea the depth of antagonism toward the Clinton election evinced by such stalwarts as Scalia, Colson, Dobson, et al who, in public statements, suggested that any ruler, elected or otherwise, who was not following the divine mandate as they understood it to be, deserved to be overthrown, violently if necessary. The level of their vitriol is astonishing. Place the rise of Erick Prinz's private army, the Blackwater folks, and you have a scarry scenario, since Prinz and his family were in the forefront of support for these guys. Support for privatization of military support had begun with Cheney and Rumsfeld long before their Bush the 2nd years as they reduced the military budget. Cheney's connections to Halliburton and KBR made his motivation suspect since they would be primary beneficiaries of government largess for such a scheme. There is no question that the Blackwater \"mercenaries\" (I think they meet the standard definition of the word and Blackwater hired many non-US nationals, so why quibble unless you are trying to obfuscate.) The biggest concern I have after reading this book is that the United States government had ceded foreign policy to a corporate entity. Clearly, the Blackwater folks had a very broad mandate in their charge to protect civilians. They could interpret that charge in any way they saw fit and we all know that a good offense is the best defense. The military, whose soldiers made about a fifth of the mercenary salary, were often forced to come to the aid of the Blackwater folks who might have begun a larger engagement in a situation, where, for policy reasons, the US government or military did not want to engage troops. That the mercenaries had been specifically exempted from the standard rules of engagement which applied to the military could only make things worse. This included the use of non-standard weapons. One Blackwater type admitted to using \"blended metal bullets\" which made virtually any impact fatal. In its infinite wisdom, the administration (Bremer) decided to make contractors immune from any prosectution for crimes committeed while in Iraq while performing their role under contract. That gave them virtual license to do whatever they wanted since Bremer had also ruled that the Uniform Code of Military Justice also did not apply. In addition, Congress and the administration permitted them to conduct their business in secret (since they were private companies) and even managed to vote down an anti-war-profteering bill proposed by Senator Leahy. Now think about that, they were saying, in essence, go ahead and make all the money you want, however you want, and screww the government all you want, because we say it's OK. Let's face it, it's all about money. Rumsfeld and Cheney wanted most of the cost of the war off the books, they didn't want any kind of draft that would have forced the US to take a close look at their policies, they wanted their companies (Halliburton and Blackwater - a major Republican contributor) to make a shitload of money, which they have. Not only that, but these private armies became instruments of hidden policy. The \"Caspian Guard\" operation used Blackwater troops to guard the oil pipeline through Georgia (after the US helped to subvert the government of Eduard Amvrosiyevich Shevardnadze during the so called Rose Revolution in favor of Mikheil Nikolozis dze Saakashvili because the former wasn't pro-US enough.) Using these private armies, I believe, carries significant risks for the United States. Should they be attacked, it's most likely whatever administration is in power would come under enormous pressure to send in the troops. Not only that, but the companies insist they are not responsible for benefits for the families of those killed while under contract. That's the US government's job. So we get screwed twice. It's time for a serious debate on the role of private contractors as instruments of foreign policy, and I suggest it may go beyond the military's impact. Clearly corporations with a large presence in a foreign country will have a decidedly different view of US hegemony and imperialism than Washington. So here I am reading this book and a thought springs to mind. What organization in the United States would have the manpower, the most to lose, the true belief, and the money to engage in regime change in the United States. Blackwater? Nah, I must be just paranoid, right? ...more Okay, first some literary criticism. And I hate to do this, because I saw <---A>Jeremy Scahill</---A> speak a few months ago and I genuinely liked him.

But, though the story of Blackwater is gripping, chilling, and more than just a little sinister (more on that later), I have to honestly say that carrying around this book and reading it over the course of about a month was more of a burden than a joy. Yes, of course there's nothing about it that should make one feel joy, and maybe it had more to do with my state of mind at the time, but something about the actual style and mode of writing turned me off. Fact thrown upon fact thrown upon fact, reinforced by supporting facts, and somewhat long and convoluted digressions of even more facts thrown in just to make sure the reader is paying attention. Yes, we get it, you did your research. But the story itself--and the dramatic pacing specifically--suffer because of this never-ending barrage of facts. Yes, again, I understand this is nonfiction--not the latest Michael Crichton political thriller--and maybe others feel differently, but reading this book was like trudging through mud, or wading in quicksand, or stumbling up all 108 flights of stairs in the Sears Tower dragging a ball and chain: you know it's going to be cool when you get to the top and finally grasp the enormity of the panoramic landscape spread out before you, but it was one tough climb getting there. Maybe I'm being too critical. I sure hope Mr. Scahill doesn't read this. Don't get me wrong, I am disturbed by the fact that our government is semi-secretly building a corporate army (the new \"Praetorian Guard\" as the author calls it) to loyally serve the far right, that this army seems so far to be impervious to any attempt to hold it accountable for its actions in the way that the actual military is (to some degree anyway), etc. (Even writing a review of this book has drained me to the point where I just throw an \"et cetera\" at the end of my sentence because I don't feel like going on anymore.) I'll end on this note: of all the frightening, alarming, horrific things this book touches upon, if one thing really stands out in my mind it is this: what incentive does a private, profit-driven mercenary army have to create and maintain peace and democracy, and to eradicate suffering and anarchy? Oh yeah, the same incentive that our current government has--none, to be exact. And that is scary. So, thank you Mr. Scahill for your hard work and dedication in exposing this story and bringing it to a mass audience. I promise I will never again say a bad word about you. ...more One can draw a straight line from Tim Weiner\u2019s extensive report on the CIA, Legacy of Ashes , and this book by Jeremy Scahill on the outsourcing of American military, security, and investigative duties.

Scahill centers his work around the event that transfixed the world and brought awareness of Blackwater to the fore for those of us not immediately engaged in military operations. The event was the 2004 murder of Blackwater employees in the city of Fallujah wherein the victims were killed, dismembered, and hung from an overpass to remind Americans that in Fallujah at least, Americans were not welcome. What Scahill shares with us here is his report of a Christian army of for-profit soldiers headquartered in North Carolina who have grown in size and weaponry to rival national militaries around the world. Begun in 1997 as a private advanced training facility for active-duty soldiers and police, Blackwater grew during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to supplying weapons-trained military \u201csecurity personnel,\u201d receiving lucrative contracts from a U.S. government unwilling to face the political backlash from a public unhappy with military losses overseas. Blackwater marketed its services by saying it could accomplish more with less, though it is difficult to see how their proffered services cost us less. As profits grew for the corporate organization, Blackwater sought cheaper and cheaper contracts with mercenary soldiers in South American and Latin American countries, as well as Eastern European, African, and select Asian countries. Sometimes when they cut corners on equipment, training, or staffing they found themselves embroiled in lawsuits in the U.S. as a result of tragic and allegedly preventable deaths. What was particularly shocking to me was the overt tone of the speeches and promotional material produced by the leadership of the organization, in that it completely resembled ISIS rhetoric about holy wars, and fighting for the will of God. Far right wing religious groups with which Blackwater founder Erik Prince is affiliated were writing in the 1990\u2019s that the Christian community might need to face the possibility that the \u201cregime\u201d (our government!) might force their Church into confrontation ranging from \u201cnoncompliance\u2026to morally justified revolution.\u201d It is in this context that the largest privately-held store of military grade weapons was begun. Their god is a Christian one, but they stand allied with Israel, and trace their religious roots back to the Crusades, which was medieval in its very concept and reflected the fanatic religious warriors now terrorizing the Middle East. Scahill is scrupulous in his reporting on the effect of Blackwater forces in the Iraq and Afghan wars, and when it seems he might be getting off the point by describing, for instance, the Chilean mercenary contingent that became a part of Blackwater, he is so vastly interesting that I\u2019m glad he left the material in. Scahill also details the use of Blackwater forces in the catastrophe that was Hurricane Katrina, in 2005, providing property and force protection for FEMA officials. It seems appropriate somehow that Bush was more concerned with property than with residents. More importantly, perhaps, is the fact that these contractors do not operate under the same restrictions and set of rules that govern national troops, and their contracts often leave them free of liability or of obligations in terms of insurance that we commonly find acceptable. Critics decry the rise of heavily-armed mercenaries as \u201ckillers for hire,\u201d suggesting that their contractual freedom from culpability and their for-profit motive may lead them to start conflict rather than prevent it. The growth of Blackwater was exponential during the years of a Republican government and was not curbed enough under a Democratic president. \u201cIn 2008 the number of private contractors in Iraq was at a one-to-one ratio with active-duty U.S. soldiers,\u201d according to Scahill. This book was published in 2007 and updated in 2008, but a June 2010 article in Nation magazine written by Scahill brings us up to date: \u201cBlackwater is up for sale and its shadowy owner, Erik Prince, is rumored to be planning to move to the United Arab Emirates as his top deputies face indictment for a range of alleged crimes, yet the company remains a central part of President Obama\u2019s Afghanistan war. Now, Blackwater\u2019s role is expanding\u2026 Earlier this year, Schakowsky and Senator Bernie Sanders reintroduced the Stop Outsourcing Security Act, which would phase out the use of private security contractors by the government. Ironically, Hillary Clinton was a co-sponsor of the legislation when she was a senator and running for president. Now, as Secretary of State, she is the US official in charge of most Blackwater contracts. Blackwater is also bidding on a contract potentially worth up to $1 billion to train the Afghan National Police.\u201d It is difficult for me to accept the concept of a religiously-motivated army and I am not comfortable with a extra-legal military force that operates for profit. Scahill won the George Polk Award for his reporting on Blackwater. The book is beautifully written and, though a large book, it is an engrossing read. I listened to the Blackstone Audio production audio read by Tom (not Tim) Weiner and thought it terrific. ...more First, a little background on my own biases: I saw September 11th with my own eyes, and fully supported a military response (of whatever form necessary) to capture Osama bin Laden and break up Afghani training camps for Al-Qaeda.

I opposed the invasion of Iraq from day one, though was happy to see one less dictator in the world who had committed genocide against a portion of his own population. I used to subscribe to The Nation , but eventually found its \"reporting\" to be wildly simplistic, dogmatic and plain uninteresting. I have interned for the UN in Rwanda, and read widely about international affairs. This is a book on a fascinating topic, written moderately well. The question at its center - are we comfortable with the increasing privatization of our military, and all the attendant questions it raises - is a good one. Unfortunately, the author's answer is a foregone conclusion from page one, and the reader is expected to agree from the same starting point. This was frustrating, and this book did not answer my questions, merely emphasizing them. Often, the author cites DoD officials, leaders in the \"private security contracting\" industry, and political supporters as if the points they raise are so ridiculous they speak for themselves. If the reader is not beholden to a specific political agenda, but genuinely curious about these issues, I think s/he will find many times that these individuals will raise a good point. Scahill needed to argue clearly and concisely why the things they were saying were so offensive. Lots of research done for this book, but it did not quite up to the damning conclusion the author reaches. If anything, the disaster in Iraq should prove that the world's emerging security threats cannot be solved through traditional military solutions. Many of the cases cited in the book, from Sierra Leone, to car bombings in the Middle East, to the ravages of Darfur, prove that the worst cases require new answers - more mobile, more efficient, more versatile forces, buoyed by more in-depth intelligence. There are many questionable aspects to the rise of mercenary forces in the \"war on terror.\" The fact that they sit outside of any legal jurisdiction for their actions is perhaps the most damning, especially when so many of these soldiers come from countries with notoriously bad human rights records. The amount of connections Blackwater (specifically) has with curious, secretive government initiatives (such as the readying of military bases all along the Caspian border countries) should get anyone's inner conspiracy theorist buzzing. The extreme religious outlook of its leaders, given the places its troops are primarily active, should give one pause as to the true motives of this company. But like I mentioned, the overall effect of this is to raise some big questions - ones that the author assumes are answered from page one. In short, The Nation choir will sing its praises, but comes far short of claiming the conclusions it stakes out at the end. Still, it's well researched, dives deep into many of the questions at play, and should be read as a means of provoking discussion on an important topic. ...more Yes, I read the whole book. Painfully so. No, I don't think it was worth my time or money. Like many other reviewers, I bought this book hoping to get a historical perspective on the Blackwater company.

Worse yet, Scahill himself admits he didn't research or write most of this book, rather one of his graduate assistants did (read the foreward). The author strays off topic repeatedly, droning on about the influence of the religious right within the US Government, or about other contractors besides Blackwater. The total factual information about Blackwater contained in this book could have easily been condensed down to 100 pages or less. And should have been. The author's anti-Christian and left-leaning Liberal bias is so strong as to taint any facts presented in this text, regardless of whether you are liberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat. That's a shame, since there is some interesting information presented in the book. Unfortunately you have wade through a 400+ page opinion piece on religion and outsourcing to get to it. If you want to find out more about Blackwater, read something else. If you want to reinforce your own Liberal bias against the US Government...well then you don't need to read this book anyway. ...more I picked up this book hoping it would provide some good basic information about Blackwater, with the understanding from the dust jacket that it likely would reach certain ultimate conclusions I might not agree with.

In reality, the book provides only superficial information, merely regurgitating the reporting of several already-public incidents, then quoting supporters and detractors of Blackwater and similar private military companies. Mr. Scahill almost invariably characterizes statements from supporters as misleading spin or the conspiratorial lies of right-wing, neoconservative, Christian fundamentalist Republicans. By contrast, Mr. Scahill quotes the statements of opponents as though they were transparent utterances of unalloyed truth. The real truth, of course, is much more complex, and so Mr. Scahill's book does not provide any analysis of real value. There are serious concerns that should be addressed related to the use of private military forces, but this book cannot contribute meaningfully to any discussion because of its political presumptions, strident tone and lack of content. Instead of a history of Blackwater, it is more akin to \"hist-eria\". ...more There is little need for me to do a review of this one as the review that encouraged me to read it in the first place pretty well sums up my feelings about it too: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... .

Another excellent review by my mate Eric. Now, one of the recent books I have read called Mistakes Were Made, but not by me points out that the most dangerous people in the world are people who have high self-esteem and they are at their most dangerous when they are forced to do bad things to powerless people. You might think that there may well be a parallel here \u2013 given that it is possible that the US is the nation with the highest apparent \u2018self-esteem\u2019 in the world and in Iraq they are dealing with people of very limited power to retaliate. I thought about this a lot during this book \u2013 I also thought that the people who set up Blackwater are fundamentalist Christians and I thought it might be a good thing to say something along the lines that when people who have very strict moral standards are confronted with people who have different moral standards the first group of people often tend to do incredibly nasty things to the second group of people if they can get away with it. But what I find most fascinating is that these \u2018faith-based\u2019 organisations \u2013 and, believe it or not, Blackwater is \u2018faith-based\u2019 \u2013 almost invariably do things (even to their \u2018friends\u2019) that simply cannot be considered moral in any sense. These people are low-life, pure and simple. I used to think that people would need to be able to believe something before they could espouse it. Let\u2019s stay with Christianity for a moment and its links to free market economics. You know, Jesus Christ didn\u2019t really say very much about economics, but one of the things he did say was that the rich will have a rather hard time getting into the kingdom of heaven \u2013 something like a camel struggling through the eye of a needle. And he said that if you want to be good you should follow his example and give everything you own to the poor. The only quote by him that seems to justify the right wing excesses that his religion seems inspire is perhaps \u201cThe poor are with you always\u201d \u2013 as an excuse for him getting pampered for a while with essential oils and such. Even great men are allowed a moment of weakness, I guess. But honestly, the whole kill or be killed, an eye for a tooth, make money at any cost, stomp on your brother before he stomps on you \u2013 is so opposite to the clear message of Christ that it is hard to know how these guys like Prince and Black can live with the dissonance. The other interesting thing is how often these guys say things like, private armies are more effective and cheaper than regular armies. Naturally, no proof is required and the US government hides the figures so no one can check \u2013 a clear indication that there is something worth hiding. They also quote the US founding fathers whenever possible, but never that crap Washington came off with about never telling a lie \u2013 what was that guy on, anyway? This is another deeply disturbing book in the mode of Blowback, Failed States and The Shock Doctrine. Although not as disturbing as The Shock Doctrine (even when they cover the same territory) this is still a confronting read. ...more This gives a history and account of various misdeeds by Blackwater and their born ultra-rich right wing Christian kook founder Erik Prince. It goes in depth with the infamous Fallujah incident where \"civilian contractors\" (actually they were former Special Forces guys working for Blackwater) were ambushed, yanked out of the car, burnt alive and their corpses were hung from a Fallujah bridge.

It looked like an inside job set up to me when I first saw the incident in the news a few years back and now I am even more convinced. Between it being a last minute assignment, at least one of the guys was in the doghouse with higher ups, the Iraqis not only had a camera there to record the whole event but they had an anti-American sign written up in ENGLISH all ready to show. Plus Bush was on the campaign trail so this would fire up all the dumb rednecks in the States and they needed this as propaganda to justify going full bore into Fallujah. Sorry but the Blackwater/Fallujah incident was a blatant Psy-Op. Another shocking thing was how politically clueless some of these Blackwater mercenaries seemed to be. There was one where he thought Saddam Hussein was responsible for 9/11 and another was quoted as saying if he was going to die it would be \"out with a bang\", \"defending his country\". Somebody please explain to me what the hell shooting at a bunch of Arab hillbillies on the other side of the world has to do with defending America? Put Blackwater on the Mexican border might be of use for defending America but that will never happen because they are really a globalist goon squad that pimp patriotism to morons when its convenient. Probably the scariest thing is Blackwater is angling to be some sort of global mercenary \"peacekeeping\" force for the United Nations. If there is a problem area, instead of sending in Nato, or UN forces to the Sudan or where ever they send in Blackwater. But really corporate goon squads for the \"elite\" are nothing new (ever heard of the Pinkertons?) but Blackwater may end up like America as a whole, a snake eating its own tail out of their lust for short term greed. They already are using a significant number of soldiers from third world nations because they are cheaper to hire. This book does have a big left wing bias but I actually think only a leftist would write a realistic book on Blackwater. I can only imagine the garbage a book about Blackwater would be if it had been written by a Neo-Con Republican. ...more This book covers Iraq and mercenaries in great detail.

It is so huge and dense with research but it skips along in intense narration. Classic muckraking on the mercenary, military contractor, \"peace and security\" industry, focusing on Blackwater's story in particular. Blackwater began as a couple extremely rich ex-Navy Seals who built a training ground and used their expertise to train military and police in the US. Then they realized they could take all the other ex-special ops dudes like themselves, except poorer, and sell their bodies as weapons of war to do the politically dirty work of guarding detested US colonial politicians using any means necessary, as in, quite literally as detailed in the book, shooting at any Iraqis in the vicinity, even if the convoy is driving without warning through a crowded city square. Which is what Blackwater and other private security staff do-- they fucking kill so many Iraqi people with complete impunity. We don't know how many though, because no one keeps those statistics. They work for the State Department and US military, but neither monitors mercenary actions. Here is some feable umbrage I got going on, all kinds of impotent rage: yes, people are being shot and killed and injured and all of that by bored ex-military soldiers who feel like they don't have any other useful skills and want to make bank in as quick a way possible and actually do not recognize humanity in other humans, talking about 'bad guys' and 'the terrorists' and that is just like, happening, now, and all the time. Wow I hate soldiers of just about all kinds. Money. Jesus. Anyway. Anyway, on with the impotent rage. Some particularly egregious shit include the way once they established themselves with their fancy & very expensive ex-American soldiers, Blackwater then outsourced to hiring way cheaper fancy soldiers from disgraced dictatorial regimes, like Chilean torturers. The daily pay goes from like $600 per DAY to $4000 per MONTH, and eventually there's a minor scandal when a bunch of Colombians are shipped to Iraq on short notice only to realize the contract they signed two hours before getting on the plane had been edited from their previous one to reduce their pay to $1000/month, and when they protested were told, \"He who wanted to go back could do so, but we didn't have a single peso and where were we going to get in Baghdad the 10 or 12 millions pesos for a ticket to Colombia?\" (p. 267) So from sweet lucrative 2-months for $60,000 to indentured servitude, but killing rando Iraqis either way. In the words of a Chilean torture victim turned advocate: There is something deeply perverse about the privatization of the Iraq War and the utilization of mercenaries. This externalization of services or outsourcing attempts to lower costs-- 'Third World' mercenaries are paid less than their counterparts from the developed world-- and maximize benefits, i.e. 'Let others fight the war for the Americans.' In either case, th Iraqi people do not matter at all. It is precisely this dehumanization of the 'enemy; that makes it easier for the private companies and the US government to recruit mercenaries. It is exactly the same strategy used by the Chilean military to train members of the secret police and make it easier to annihilate opponents of the dictatorship. In other words, Chilean mercenaries in Iraq is business as usual. (p. 273) Scahill exposes the events leading up to four Blackwater soldiers getting shot as they drove in a convoy of kitchen equipment, dragged out of the SUVs, set on fire, hacked into pieces, and hung over a bridge in the center city. Apparently the company was cutting costs and sent the men out in pairs instead of the normal 3, so there was no dude with a gun in the backseat protecting the guys in front who didn't have accurate maps and were kind of lost and occupied navigating a city that even the marines wouldn't enter at that time because the Americans were so hated there. OK that sux0rs insanely much yeah but in the words of one of those Blackwater men's mothers, \"Over a thousand people died because of what happened to Scotty [Helveston] that day,\" referencing the first of several mass bombings/invasions of Fallajuh that took place immediately following the incident at the behest of Rumsfeld de Privatization despite the local marine commander's request that they please not do that (p.304). Blackwater's latest project is trying to get in on NATO missions and UN Peacekeeping missions. Also, spying for corporations, with a division composed of retired CIA agents. Also, training various Iraqi ethnic militias to act as death squads in a tactic they actually call the Salvadoran Option. Oh and Blackwater was one of the first on the ground in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, armed to the teeth and offering protective services to rich people and businesses as the \"donation\" to the suffering city. Scahill's book slides gracefully between stories of massacres and contracted soldiers dying from cheap business practices, to tracing the behind the scenes money and motives, and onto synthesis about why, tying these specific examples of horror and scandal clearly into the greater system of privatization that has surged forward in these past ten years. Dude claims Amy Goodman and Naomi Klein as mentors and comrades, and this book compliments Democracy Now! and the Shock Doctrine, zeroing in on this specifically graphic form of neoliberal violence. From an anti-torture NGO worker: \"To the extent that a population is called on to go to war, there is resistance ... to prevent wars of self-aggrandizement. ... Private forces are almost a necessity for a United States bent on retaining its declining empire.\" (p. 433) Final fun fact: South Africa recently banned all \"South Africans from participating 'as a combatant for private gain in an armed conflict' or from involvement in 'any act aimed at overthrowing a government or undermining the constitutional order, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of a state\" EXCEPT in \"legitimate armed struggles, including struggles waged, in accordance with international humanitarian law, for national liberation; self-determination independence against colonialism, or resistance against occupation, aggression, or domination by foreign nationals or foreign forces.\" (p.431) Viva war resisters everywhere. ...more A good book about subject matter that raises a lot of questions, but Scahill doesn't always do a satisfactory job of answering them.

Scahill has done his best to penetrate the veil of secrecy that surrounds Blackwater and its operations, and has probably done as good a job as anyone could in the circumstances. But he's better at the small-scale stuff (the story of how a bunch of Chilean Blackwater recruits ended up fighting an American war in Iraq, for instance) than he is at the big-picture context, and that's what ended up making this a disappointing read for me. I learned a lot about Blackwater and its founder, Erik Prince. This book is pretty one-sided for the most part. This is probably since Blackwater is so secretive, and because few of Blackwater's people wanted to do interviews with Scahill, which is a shame, since then we pretty much only hear Scahill's side of the story. Scahill shockingly omits the fundamentally important fact that the overwhelming majority of contractors doing security and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan are Iraqis and Afghans - the very people who should be doing security in reconstruction in their own country. While military operations certainly have their place in stability operations, it is wages and capacity building from the stability operations industry are the building blocks for long term state viability. Also while the U.S. military is designed to be the most capable organization in the world, it is not really designed to be cost-effective. It is estimated that the Pentagon was paying $15-25,000 per month per soldier in Iraq. Contractors, brought in to support the effort from a hundred different countries, bring remarkable cost effectiveness, capabilities and expertise. And yes, not surprisingly they cost far less than trained combat soldiers. There are tasks that only the military should be doing, but supporting the military can been done better and cheaper utilizing private services. Phrases such as \" ...unloading cartridges of ammo...\" (pages xii and 102) boggled my mind. My English teachers wouldn't have allowed such poor English in my papers. It's like saying \"sandwiches of food.\" What did author Scahill mean by \"..a heavy SAW machine gun with a 180-degree scope...\" anyway? Did he mean \"field of fire?\" The M4 Carbine is properly referred to as either a carbine or a rifle--but not a \"carbine rifle \" (pages xxiii and 369). Visual Flight Rules (VFR) was wrongly defined on page 240--under VFR pilots DO use instrumentation (turn and bank indicators, altimeter, gyro compass, magnetic compass, GPS navigation, rate-of-climb) much like they do under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)--but you need to ask a real pilot to explain the difference. The main difference is that VFR bans flying when visibility is too poor and IFR permits flying when VFR grounds aircraft. But a bigger problem for me was Scahill's bias and sometimes misleading reporting. For example, Scahill quotes people comparing Blackwater to Hitler's SA brownshirts, which is laughable. Scahill also finds it \"scary\" that Erik Prince is a Christian, and he calls Chuck Colson and Gary Bauer \"militant Christian extremists.\" Scahill calls every Christian organization affiliated with Prince \"extremists\", but he never bothers to explain what supposedly makes them so extremist. Scahill pretends that Prince's Christian \"connections\" and viewpoints have serious implications, but he never bothers to explain what those implications are. Scahill also accuses William Boykin, former undersecretary of defense for intelligence, of going on \"anti-Muslim rants\" in public speeches, but if you've ever studied any of those speeches, they are not anti-Muslim and were given in front of Christian audiences. Scahill also writes that Boykin was put in charge of hunting \"high-value targets\", which is not true, and has nothing to do with the position that Boykin occupied. After Scahill is done reporting his \"facts\", he utterly fails to connect them in any way whatsoever to the larger narrative about Blackwater. If Boykin had nothing to do with Blackwater, then Scahill's anti-Boykin's rants are distracting and utterly pointless. ...more This book is full of double standards and petty fault finding.

He condemns Eric Prince for being a \"theocon\" who wants to make God have more of a roll in government, but then sees nothing wrong with Iraqi's praising God and talking about how God will kick the Americans out. The feeling I go is that religion is okay in a society that has been oppressed and kept ignorant, but not in the elite country of the US with all it's education. Another point that was laughable was when he talked about Blackwater's \"dubious\" business practices. He stated they would pay soldiers 600 a day, but charge 800. That organization would charge 1200, and that organization would charge 1500. True, that's a lot of subcontractors, but charging more than your actual, physical costs is not \"dubious\", it's good business. If you only charged what it cost you, you would never make any money. Scahill has so little understanding of how a business actually works and makes money, it's laughable. I would have preferred a book that examined the problem more objectively, and less vindictively. ...more Seemed to run out of steam toward the end when it shifted from recounting of major events to personnel profiles.

It is one thing to have a strong opinion, but quite another to let that brilliant idea cloud your judgment and from his style, I am rather doubtful how objective the history he's presenting is. Second, he basically summarizes the whole book in the beginning and then unravels them, often repeating himself without any more insight. Third, the title of the book is about Blackwater, but many of the chapters are quite irrelevant. But let me try to be more lenient on this book. In all fairness, it is quite an interesting and informative book. Among other things, what disturbs me the most about private companies is that they can commit any crime, including murder or use of illegal weapons, with impunity. They are exempt from the US Uniform Code of Military Justice because they are \"civilians\", and much worse, no law can touch them at all. They can refuse to provide information about their business conduct on grounds that the contracts contain proprietary information. It is rather concerning that a (arguably) democratically-elected government is sending an army that is not accountable to anyone into a troubled region, which has now proven to cause disastrous consequences. The behaviour of American soldiers probably hasn\u2019t been that impeccable in Iraq and elsewhere, but at least, you can bring them to court. That\u2019s not the case with Blackwater. The implication for US foreign policy and American image overseas is immense. The US government is sending all over the globe huge companies whose sole purpose is to earn money, not to stabilize peace. And they can brutalize, kill, abuse the local population as much as they like, without any fear of being brought to justice. I keep thinking again and again about how Robert Fisk describes the UN forces from poor countries operating in Iraq tend to be a lot more sympathetic and humble to the local population compared to the forces from richer countries. And here we have non-peacekeeping forces with dubious credentials getting paid shit loads treating locals like dirt just to get their job done. Looks like typical arrogant imperialistic behaviour to me. Another disturbing fact about Blackwater is that they do not just disregard their enemies\u2019 lives but their own employees\u2019 lives too. To reduce cost and boost their profits, they cut down on security measures, pushing their employees into dangerous situations with inappropriate protection. That\u2019s the reason why the four Blackwater men got ambushed in Fallujah in 2004. Private companies are accountable to pretty much no government for their recruitment practices. They can hire anyone, including thugs that were involved in apartheid South Africa and Chile. BW has enough manpower and force to overthrow many governments in the world, and if the military complex has manipulated the US gov to such an extent and has such military prowess, isn\u2019t that horribly bothersome? Another thing that is quite distressing is the ideology behind BW. It is all about money, not charity, not peace, not security. They have a vested interest in destabilizing the situation in Iraq, more violence, more need for security, more contractors, more violence, the cycle goes on. I often find it extremely hard to reconcile the Christian \u201cmorality\u201d they\u2019re claiming with their actual practice. Jesus said nothing about patriotism or privatization, but these people with wonderful imagination can cook up all of these things, I always find that puzzling and fascinating. But maybe as my friend said, this ideology is made up by people who don\u2019t think at all. Sending fundamentalist Christians who want to kill off as many Muslims as possible into Iraq is probably a sign that my friend is correct. The privatization of the US military initiated by Rumsfeld and Cheney et al has created a huge opportunity for private security companies like BW to flourish, at the expense of chaos, violence and a huge human cost. if there's one argument against privatization then I think this would make one of the strongest cases. to me it seems, war no longer serves as a means to pursue national interests but an ends in itself, driven by the powerful special interests that are vested in the private military companies. In the process, America is letting private companies undermine the principle of democratic accountability. Usually, if a president wants to increase the size of the military forces or send troops abroad, he has to seek approval from Congress. Decisions about contracts for private security are made exclusively by the executive branch, and very inaccessible to the public. Private companies are not held accountable to the public and very hard to be monitored by journalists or non-governmental organizations, unlike the US military. And by excluding their casualties from the official figure, the government practically tells a lie about the war. At this point, the free market people would balk and say despite all of its shortcomings, privatization is more efficient. but who's to say that it is? who discloses and monitors the costs? literally no one. Government frequently curtail competition to preserve reliability and pay service to particular companies that had contributed to their campaigns. I wonder how that efficiency argument can hold if it is repeatedly stressed in the book that private contractors are paid 3 times as high as a US military personnel. In an interview with PBS on frontline a spokesperson of KBR repeatedly dodged the question about the cost of the operation. I think the one point that is quite weak about this book is his argument against using private companies in peacekeeping forces. The private forces could have helped halt the atrocities in Rwanda in no time. He didn't seem to have a convincing argument against that. another interesting book on US militarism that is worth looking at is Political Economy of US Militarism by Ismael Hossein zadeh. ...more From my Cannonball Read V review... Just to make sure we're all on the same page: Blackwater is a horrible, horrible, horrible company, right? Like, everyone with a conscience is aware of that fact?

Just to make sure we're all on the same page: Blackwater is a horrible, horrible, horrible company, right? Like, everyone with a conscience is aware of that fact? Everyone who works there is not a horrible person (many are just trying to survive), but we all know that the organization is bloody awful, yes? Okay, so starting from that premise, why read a book that tells you in detail about how horrible it is? Because it's good. Really good. It is very well researched, with a level of detail in the writing that brings home the realities of just how atrocious an organization this is. Scahill provides a history of the company, from its roots in the southern U.S., through the Iraq war and into present day, where Blackwater (now ACADEMI) has truly terrifying plans. He discusses the problems of a mercenary army - recruitment, payment, accountability (well, lack thereof), lawlessness. He uses the murder of four Blackwater contractors in Fallujah as backdrop against which the book is set, returning to what happened, how it happened, and the impact on the families. That running story points out how expendable these contractors are to the company. Their lives may be on the line, and they may be getting great compensation (unless they are from South American or Africa, which Scahill addresses in the book), but in the end, the company doesn't care about them. Their deaths are a PR issue, but that's about it. The biggest problem with contractors like Blackwater from the perspective of the county and the world is that they are essentially mercenaries. They are paid to protect the elite, to do things that our military might or might not be able to do, and they aren\u2019t accountable to anyone. They may technically be subcontractors, but they aren\u2019t covered by the same laws as private citizens, and they pretend to be military even though they don\u2019t have the same oversight. They can do whatever they want with minimal consequences; claiming immunity as a quasi-military organization. It\u2019s despicable. From the perspective of the families of the contractors who are killed due to the careless policies of Blackwater (and, by extension, the U.S. government for contracting with them), these contractors don\u2019t get the same respect and care as the military. Some of them may be doing work that troops would have done in the past, but because they aren\u2019t military, they don\u2019t get the same benefits, or support. Is that wrong? I don\u2019t know. You can argue they know what they signed up for, but Blackwater is so shady that who knows what they were really told, and how much time they all had to really review what they signed. Beyond the tasks Blackwater performed in Iraq and Afghanistan, they also ingratiated themselves in the Katrina response, taking part in disaster profiteering. They lied about saving lives, and tried to not pay the contractors the prevailing ways. This company isn\u2019t just bad for the reasons stated above; they are bad because of what they represent: a shift from governmental accountability to private (stockholder / owner) accountability. One thing about war is that the country is supposed to feel the consequences of it. It should keep us from just going to war with anyone we dislike, without cause. But as more of the actions are shifted to mercenary companies like Blackwater, who\u2019s to speak up and say it\u2019s not okay? If you have any interest in this, and want to have some details to back up your understanding that Blackwater is just appalling, check out the book. ...more This is a tough book to review: it's clearly the best-researched and most-complete work on its topic, but it is also very biased.

Jeremy Scahill is a first-rate investigative journalist, of that I have no doubt, but he also has a clear anti-Blackwater, anti-Prince family agenda to sell, and he wastes not a single word selling it here. While Scahill claims he requested interviews with Erik Prince and other Blackwater executives and was refused any such interviews, this is about as close to approaching the entire matter as in a non-biased manner as Scahill comes. There are numerous instances which, if they happened exactly as Scahill reports, were clearly abuses of power by Blackwater contractors. However, since Scahill delights in dwelling on issues such has pages upon pages explaining how many thousands of dollars the Prince family has contributed to conservative and Republican causes over the years, it is at times difficult to trust him. I am no fan of, in example, Focus on the Family (conservative Christian non-profit group) but Erik Prince has every right to donate some of his ample wealth to this group\u2014just as, say, Barbra Streisand has every right to donate some of her ample wealth to liberal causes. I could have done without Scahill's extensive efforts to prove (over and over again) how conservative the Prince family and Blackwater's high administration are: I don't think their politics really surprise anyone. The focus should be fully on the work of Blackwater and where there were scandals and valid questions about that work. Another issue I had with this book was how often Scahill would abandon a topic he brought up (often for something less interesting at that) such as when he starts to make connections between Blackwater and the CIA's rendition flights then, after he admits he really doesn't have any clear evidence to support his musings, simple drops the topic altogether. I would be willing to listen to Scahill's theories and see what dots he tries to connect even if lacking complete evidence given how murky a topic this is in the first place, but for him to bring something up then really not flesh it out as fully as possible was irksome. In Trevor Paglen's writing on rendition, Paglen often admits that only so many facts are availible and expectedly, a lot of conjecture must be entertained. Anyone interested in black ops will understand that, yeah, when dealing with secret projects such is expected. In contrast, Scahill seems to bring up numerous issues simply to further taint Blackwater's image; had someone who worked for Blackwater ran over a possum driving home from work or torn the little tag off their mattress, I suspect Scahill would have included that too. The good of the book though is most of it is very well-researched and it brings up a lot of seperate incidents where Blackwater operatives engaged in actions which either got themselves or innocent bystanders killed, and often (apparently) because Blackwater couldn't be bothered with proper security or fully taking necessary measures to ensure mission safety. If you are interested in Blackwater/Xe or the war in Iraq in general even, this is a good place to start. Alas, there is nothing truly unbiased: you either get Blackwater's own stance on themselves or you get a book like this which is fully opposed to nearly everything about the company. A good 150 pages could have been trimmed out of this book and it would have contained all the key information and seemed less the vehicle of an agenda against Blackwater and more like a journalist's unbiased account. ...more This was great; very thorough and well-researched addition to the discourse on Iraq and military policy. Scahill makes no secret of his opinions, but backs them up with enough evidence that the reader can draw her own conclusions (and it's hard not to be equally alarmed at the rise of these private military companies). Very informative and disturbing read. Jeremy Scahill has an ax to grind and a certain amount of bias shows through in this expose of Blackwater's corporate army. That said, the book is well-researched, reasonably well-written and will definitely switch your paranoia on. The book takes you through the creation of Blackwater and the background of its CEO, Eric Prince, a neo-conservative Evangelical Christian who believes that he is fighting the Crusades.

I'm pretty uncomfortable with the notion of outsourcing wars and mercenary armies make me think uncomfortably of the Italian city states in the 10th to 15th century and their constant state of warfare funded by citizens and waged by mercenary bands. I do have some quibbles with this book. The focus is almost entirely on Blackwater's involvement in Iraq with a few ancillary chapters on their involvement in other localities. I would have liked a broader view of the company and its activities. While his chapter on Blackwater's man on the ground in Chile is interesting, Scahill misses an incredible opportunity to trace the history of US involvement in Central and South America and the teaching of torture at the Academy of the Americas and frankly doesn't do a good enough job of explicating these mercenary's ties to the Pinochet government and why that is problematic. There is another missed opportunity in the chapter on Blackwater after Katrina - to observe that we had boots on the ground with guns on the Gulf Coast before there was humanitarian aid is disturbing, but again I would have liked more information about this and an analysis of how outsourcing is impacting our disaster relief efforts. Lastly, I found myself wishing Scahill was a business reporter - I think there's a big story in where the money is coming from and where it's going and I don't think this is explored well. Overall this is an interesting book, but very topical. Three years after its publication it is beginning to show its age and in another three years it'll be creaky. I think Scahill has done a great job of investigative reporting, but less well on contextualizing his subject matter. ...more When I was a boy, I did want to be a mercenary soldier one day--- I'll admit that. And in grad school I wrote extensively about Fritz Redlich's idea of the \"military entrepreneur\" in the late 16th/early 17th.-c. So I dislike seeing \"mercenary\" always used as a pejorative.

He just hasn't been able to get beyond his need to Find the Bad Guys. \"Blackwater\" is a polemic, and Scahill far too often forgets the data his research has uncovered to Find the Bad Guys. Companies like Blackwater (now re-named) developed in order to sell technical training to police and military, and only second to provide armed security and direct military service. As the US (and other) militaries downsized in the 1990s, private contractors filled in the gaps in training and technical services and provided things like diplomatic security details and bodyguards that armies no longer had the manpower to do. Governments liked not having to pay overhead costs--- no training, no pensions, no recruitment costs, no maintenance. This is the MBA \"just-in-time\" idea: hardly the right-wing conspiracy Scahill imagines. Scahill overstates the sheer size of Blackwater and other companies' presence in war zones. There may well have been up to 100,000 private contractors in Iraq, but few of those are armed men. Most are transport and logistics personnel. By his own figures, there were at most 2300 Blackwater armed men ('trigger-pullers') worldwide. Screening personnel, assuring adherence to contracts, auditing expenses--- those are all legitimate issues, and Scahill rightly points out abuses and failings. But private military contractors require State Dept. licenses, and since 2007 military contractors in war zones are subject to the UCMJ, to military courts. Whatever the problems with private companies such as Blackwater, Scahill is simply wrong in seeing them as a threat to democracy and a deep, nefarious conspiracy. ...more

You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.Well there are just too many example of his applying this to say something that was, well not really true. Now if you don't don't see a problem with all the above and you believe War is Peace, you must also believe Ignorance is Strength. 1984 was supposed to be a waring not a instruction manual. Now pretty much everyone Mr. Prince looked up to, worked with or hired; had somehow been involved in the training/running or execution of Coups/Death Squads around the world, resulting in thousands of innocent civilians killed. I came to realize while reading this that this man and his type are a cancer on humanity that get rich from the tax payer dollar while committing the worst crimes imaginable all with impunity. If this man had any shred of sanity he would see that he is doing the opposite of what his religion states. His type is truly psychotic and represent the worst of humanity. ...more Nation contributor Jeremy Scahill gives readers a terrifying examination of Blackwater, one of the world's largest and most powerful mercenary companies.

Run by the Christian neocon Erik Prince, Blackwater has numerous ties to the Bush administration and has thousands of mercenaries operating in Iraq. As the US army and public support for military operations are increasingly stretched thin, Blackwater has positioned itself as the perfect solution for the neocons...guns for hire that are not accountable to Congress, the American people, or military justice. In fact, shortly before leaving Iraq, Paul Bremer passed an edict granting all mercs immunity from prosecution. Blackwater's mercs have not only been sent abroad for numerous missions, but were heavily present on US soil during the Katrina aftermath. These private soldiers hail from around the globe, including thousands of Chilean ex-Pinochet paramilitary. Death squad work not paying enough in your third world country? Join Blackwater! Ladies and gentlemen, this is the future of warfare. Private armies, capable of toppling governments, whose allegiance is the dollar and have no moral or legal accountability. One of the scariest books I've ever read. ...more Scahill's book should be highly commended for its incredible wealth of information about Blackwater, the people at the head of the company, and the actors that influenced and supported the private security firms during the first three years of the Iraq War.

It was astonishing to see how deep the connections ran between extremist religious groups, far-right Republicans, and the mercenary industry Scahill critiques. I did find, however, that Scahill reached a little bit by stating that Blackwater was the \"Praetorian Guard\" for the Bush administration and that it was a militia of sorts for the theoconservative movement. While the people within Blackwater were certainly theoconservatives, it does not necessarily mean that they use the corporation itself and its contractors to directly support conservative religious causes. I though that Scahill went too far to try to portray the company as religiously conservative, but he is correct in worrying about the ambiguous legal status of mercenary corporations. ...more This is a frightening and erudite expose of the rise of the mercenary in U.S. \"total force\" projection.

Written from a clearly liberal perspective did not bother me because Scahill was also critical of certain democrats and did mention certain republicans like Gasserly and McCain who are troubled by as quoted by Eisenhower, \"the danger in the rise of military industrial complex\". As I am libertarian, I do believe in free market enterprise but not when it comes from favoritism from certain elected officials. I am also troubled by Blackwater founder Erik Prince religious fanaticism which he uses to justify their imperial and hubristic actions, particularly their impunity to operate outside of the rules of engagement and prosecution that are military abides by. This is a very troubling development and I commend Scahill for this very well-written examination of these atrocious and permissive entities. ...more I give this book four stars because the subject matter is essential to anyone interested or concerned about the state of current affairs in the world.
