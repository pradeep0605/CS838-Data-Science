Consider the following: 1. Genghis Khan was an advocate of human rights , specifically freedom of religion, freedom from torture and free trade (he got two of the Four Freedoms right, which is pretty impressive by medieval standards, especially when they still, like, burned heretics and unbelievers in Europe and elsewhere). GK forbade the use of torture in trials and as punishment. He also granted religious freedom within his realm, though he demanded total loyalty from conquered subjects of all religions. His own immediate family was religiously diverse: besides those who were Shamanists or Buddhists, a significant number were Monophysite Christians --- and later also Muslim converts. As for the free trade thing, it was more of a byproduct of the commercial opportunities that developed along the Silk Road (\u201chistory\u2019s largest free-trade zone\u201d), once the interior of the Eurasian landmass became safe enough to travel under the Pax Mongolica . Free trade as human right is still a pretty iffy concept, anyway. 2. GK created a hitherto unprecedented egalitarian society where men and some women (more on this later) advanced through \u201cindividual merit, loyalty and achievement\u201d, instead through birth and aristocratic privilege. This egalitarian society was also incredibly diverse, comprising of people of different religions and nations. The Mongols hired European artisans to decorate their HQ in Xanadu, Chinese engineers to man their siege engines, and Muslim astronomers to chart their horoscopes. And they might have hired an Italian guy called Marco Polo to govern the city of Hangzhou --- who knows? But there\u2019s no independent proof of it whatsoever. 3. GK was a proto-feminist --- well, he was sort of pro-woman, in the context of his era. He made it law that women are not to be kidnapped, sold or traded. Through marital alliances, he installed his daughters as de facto rulers over conquered nations. In Mongol culture, when the men went off to war, the women ruled the roost. And since Mongol men in the time of GK went really far away to conquer distant nations and did not return for years, the wives and daughters were the real boss at home (and also at the various Mongol courts, when many of GK\u2019s male descendants turned out to be drunken incompetents). A successful queen like Sorkhothani, the wife of GK\u2019s youngest son, was able to rule in her dead husband\u2019s stead and made all of her sons Great Khans. Failure, however, could doom such women into cruel and unusual punishments, such as being sewed up naked into a rug and then pummeled to death (Mongols abhorred the sight of blood, thus the rug). 4. The Mongols promoted pragmatic, non-dogmatic intellectual development in the countries that they ruled. Although himself an illiterate, GK and his family recognized the value of learning and actively encouraged the development of the sciences. Under the Mongols, learned men did not have to \u201cworry whether their astronomy agreed with the precepts of the Bible, that their standards of writing followed the classical principles taught by the mandarins of China, or that Muslim imams disapproved of their printing and painting.\u201d New technology, such as paper and printing, gunpowder and the compass were transmitted through the Mongol realm to the West and sparked the Renaissance a few generations later. 5. The Mongols were for low taxes . GK lowered taxes for everyone, and abolished them altogether for professionals such as doctors, teachers and priests, and educational institutions. 6. The Mongols established a regular census and created the first international postal system . 7. The Mongols invented paper money (it was soon abandoned because of hyper-inflation, but they got the right idea) and elevated the status of merchants ahead of all religions and professions, second only to government officials (this is in contrast to Confucian culture, which ranked merchants as merely a step above robbers). They also widely distributed loot acquired in combat and thus promoted healthy commercial circulation of goods. 8. The Mongols improved agriculture by encouraging farmers to adopt more efficient planting methods and tools, as well as transplanting different varieties of edible plants from country to country and developed new varieties and hybrids. Okay. So Pax Mongolica was basically good for the world. But wait, how about all of those terrible massacres, rapine and wholesale destruction of cities? Didn\u2019t Genghis Khan famously stated that \u201cthe greatest joy a man can know is to conquer his enemies and drive them before him. To ride their horses and take away their possessions. To see the faces of those who were dear to them bedewed with tears, and to clasp their wives and daughters in his arms?\u201d Actually, Muslim chroniclers attributed that quote to him and it is highly unlikely that he ever uttered it. Muslims writers of the era often exaggerated Mongol atrocities for Jihad purposes.* The Mongols were very aware of the value of propaganda as a weapon of war and actively encouraged scary stories about themselves.The Mongols decimated cities that resisted them, such as Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, but they generally let those that surrendered remain unmolested. At the end of the fourteenth century, Tamerlane piled up pyramids of heads outside the cities that he conquered, and as he (flimsily) claimed to be a Mongol, \u201chis practices were anachronistically assigned back to Genghis Khan.\u201d Three centuries later, Voltaire adopted a Mongol dynasty play to fit his own personal political and social agenda by portraying GK, whom he used as a substitute for the French king, as an ignorant and cruel villain. So basically, GK got an undeservedly bad rap. Yay for Genghis Khan! * \u201c\u2026more conservative scholars place the number of dead from Genghis Khan\u2019s invasion of central Asia at 15 million within five years. Even this more modest total, however, would require that each Mongol kill more than a hundred people; the inflated tallies for other cities required a slaughter of 350 people by every Mongol soldier. Had so many people lived in the cities of central Asia at the time, they could have easily overwhelmed the invading Mongols. Although accepted as fact and repeated through the generations, the (inflated) numbers have no basis in reality.\u201d ...more This is a book that can and should be read by everyone, at least all with the slightest interest in world history.

I feel this so adamantly since what it tells us does away with serious misconceptions about the Mongol Empire. It explains in a clear and comprehensible manner how the world we live in today has been improved by Mongol practices. It is stated that the book is revisionary, but I believe wholeheartedly in what we are told. It is clear and thoroughly documented. What we are told just plain makes sense ! The author is a cultural anthropologist and historian. The book begins with a discussion about the life of Genghis Khan (1162-1227), follows his successors, offering detailed information both about <---C>Kublai Khan</---C> and powerful women of the clan, discussing the formation of the Mongol nation in 1206, the squabbling that arose between the successive leaders and concludes with a convincing analysis of how the Mongol Empire has influenced today\u2019s world. We all think of the Mongols as barbarians that wrought havoc on the world. Few of us are aware of how they opened the world to commerce. They opened new trade routes, not only of physical goods but for the transmission of ideas and cultures. I am daunted because I cannot adequately express how this book has so changed how I view world history. I used to praise the new ideas espoused during the Enlightenment, but did you know that Voltaire drew a picture of the savage, blood-thirsty Mongols that served their own purposes and created a one-sided view that hid the truth. Chaucer praised Genghis Kahn and Marco Polo did the same for Kublai Kahn; When Christopher Columbus sailed west it was to look for Cathay, to reconnect with the fantastic trade routes established by the Mongols. I could go on and on showing how what we have been told about these so-called barbarians just doesn\u2019t quite add up! What is explained here in this book makes sense and it changes how we understand today\u2019s modern world. Did you know that Genghis Kahn made the capital of his Chinese Empire present day Beijing in 1266 and that that the Forbidden City was a huge park filled with wild animals where the Mongol leaders lived in ghers/yurts? Here in this enclosed area the Mongol leaders lived according to their own Mongol traditions. They ate their traditional foods, ate with knives, which the Chinese found abhorrent, drank fermented mare\u2019s milk and practiced their own sports and games, so foreign to the Chinese culture around them. Did you know that \u201chooray\u201d is based on a Mongol expression of exuberance? Did you know that Columbus called the red-skinned natives he encountered when he landed on the islands off the American mainland Indians because he thought he had met up with the Mongols living south of the Chinese Mongols, the Mongols of India? That is why Native Americans originally were called Indians. There is so much in this book that makes sense, it is like putting together all the pieces of a puzzle and everything fits! Kublai Kahn supported universal education with classes held in the colloquial language. Paper money was invented by the Chinese, but he saw its practicality and radically expanded its usage. Under his rule China attained its Golden Age of Drama. Medical knowledge, textile production, printing techniques, basically all areas of knowledge that were practical and useful were supported and transported to new areas around the world. Under the Mongol rule there was religious freedom. In the 1200s, think of that! I listened to the audiobook narrated by Jonathan Davis. His pronunciation of Mongol terms is clear. The pacing is perfect. This is essential in a book of non-fiction. Along with the download one is given pdf files of maps and diagrams. One difficulty that I had, when I searched on the net for further information, was that often more than one name was used for the same person. It is also difficult to recognize Mongol names. This is easier if you can both see and hear them. It is time that we begin to acknowledge the good things Genghis Kahn and Kublai Kahn have given us. Read this book and you will stop using the word \u201cMongolian\u201d as a word of slander. ...more This gets two stars instead of one because it's very well written.

Born in 1162, Genghis Khan grew up an uneducated outcast on the Asian steppes. He learned through harsh experience to be an astute judge of people, to be self-reliant and to be completely ruthless. He set his own traditions. He valued loyalty first followed by competence. Lineage and social standing did not matter. He was a great organizer and quick study, taking the best ideas from each society he conquered and weaving them into an unstoppable strategy for conquest. He conscripted anyone of value into his army or his capable administrative organization. Those left behind had to pay homage or be killed. While he consulted with his compatriots, he did not tolerate dissension from anyone. He disdained torture, but killed without compunction. Weatherford is clearly enamored with his subject as he lauds Genghis Khan\u2019s resourcefulness while treating his mass killings and wholesale destruction matter-of-factly. Genghis Khan forever changed the world. Prior to his reign, Europe, China and India were all isolated from each other. The Muslim (Arab, Turkic, and Persian) realm was the most advanced in literacy, education and in trade. What limited commerce existed between West and East went through the Middle East and made its way from tribe to tribe along the Silk Road south of the Mongol homeland. Genghis Khan would bring the world, its goods, ideas and technologies, together. Genghis Khan\u2019s original name was Temujin. After a tough childhood, he was able to take over the leadership of his own tribe. Then he started aligning with or defeating nearby tribes. This included the Tatar tribe, thus causing some Europeans later to refer to the Mongols as Tartars. In 1206 he adopted the name Genghis Khan, ruling a group of tribes that would be known as the Mongols. He constantly refined his strategies, adopting the weapons and tactics of his enemies as needed. He offered his adversaries the chance to submit before attacking. Many of them became his allies. Unlike the Europeans who killed of all the commoners and saved the nobility for ransom, Genghis Khan killed all the aristocrats and conscripted the commoners. His army grew. So did his administrative staff. Genghis Khan valued highly those with skills and they were welcomed. In 1215 Genghis Khan defeated the important Jurched tribe sacking their capital in what is now Beijing. This victory gave him control of northern China and brought him in direct contact with the Sung dynasty in coastal and southern China. He did not take on the Sung because he was uncomfortable with the terrain and the humid hot climate. He headed west instead following the plains he felt at home in. In 1221 he defeated the large powerful Khwarezm Empire bringing him most of Central Asia and up against Russia and Europe. After Genghis Khan\u2019s death in 1227, his empire was split among his sons. One would occupy the role of Great Khan retaining central authority. Two major campaigns were launched, one against the Sung dynasty in China and one against Europe. The Chinese campaign weakened the Sung dynasty and took some outlying areas but failed in its goal to take China. However, the Mongols were very successful slaughtering European armies while advancing to the outskirts of Vienna in 1241 where the plains ended. Here the Mongols stopped. They had been taking in far less booty than in prior campaigns against the richer Asian societies. However the Mongols struck a deal with Genoese traders in Crimea selling Slavic prisoners for gold. The Genoese sold many of the prisoners to the Sultan of Egypt who used them in his army that would in twenty years defeat the Mongols. After the indulgent and reckless rule of two of Genghis Khan\u2019s progeny and years of infighting, Mongke Khan, one of Genghis Khan\u2019s grandsons, became the Great Khan in 1251. Mongke, the last of the Great Khans, authorized two campaigns, one against the Moslem strongholds in the Middle East and the other against the Sung dynasty. In 1258 Mongke\u2019s brother Hulegu accomplished what the crusaders never could. He victoriously entered Baghdad deposing the Caliph whose line had ruled for 500 years. Hulegu\u2019s expansion would reach its limits when his army lost to the Egyptian Mamluk slave army in 1260. Following Mongke\u2019s death in 1259 and after a prior tepid start, Mongke\u2019s brother Kublai defeated the Sung in 1271. Kublai established the Yuan dynasty creating a new united China with all the territory it has today. Kublai would become increasingly preoccupied with food, drink and song. The Yuan dynasty would begin to decay, surviving another 100 years. In 1293 the Mongol Empire reached its maximum extent. There were four separate Mongol domains. The Yuan dynasty ruled China, Tibet and Mongolia. The Ilkhanate consisted of Iraq, Iran and adjacent areas. The Golden Horde included southern Russia and Eastern Europe. The Chagatai Khanate occupied Central Asia connecting the other three. The Mongol empire although now broken into four distinct entities, stretched from Korea to Baghdad, from Viet Nam to Bulgaria. Each khanate was ruled by the decedent of an illiterate reject who a hundred years earlier roamed the hills between Siberia and the Gobi Desert. In the early part of the 14th century, the khanates prospered. The Mongol trade links that connected China, India, the Middle East and Europe facilitated the infusion of new goods and ideas. But something sinister was also along for the ride, the plague, starting in China in 1331. China lost half its population in the next twenty years. The plague spread along the Mongol trade routes reaching Europe by 1347 which would lose a third of its people in the epidemic. Trade came to a halt. The khanates isolated themselves. Cut off from each other, eventually the Mongol leaders would be displaced or absorbed into local cultures. The Ming rebels took over in China in 1368 and built walls to keep others out and themselves in. They abandoned the sea trade Kublai Khan had started, stranding Chinese in ports around Asia. Only the Chagatai Khanate preserved Mongol traditions. In 1370 Tamerlane took over Chagatai. He fancied himself a descendant of Genghis Khan who would reestablish the Great Khan\u2019s empire. Tamerlane went on to create his own Central Asian and Middle Eastern empire, but it quickly disintegrated after he died in 1405. Today when the promise and the threat of globalization are top concerns, it is fascinating to read about how it all started. 800 years ago an itinerant animal herder from one of the remotest corners of the globe rose to create the largest contiguous empire the world has ever known. In so doing he brought together for the first time the developed cultures of the world. The new technology and ideas that had come from Asia to Europe over the past two centuries would pave the way for the Renaissance. The desire to reestablish trade with China is what drove Columbus to look for a route west. Since communications with China had ceased over 100 years before his voyage, he thought the Great Khans still ruled there. The drive towards greater economic integration would march forever forward, albeit with interruptions. Weatherford, although clearly pro-Mongol biased, makes some compelling arguments about how much the modern world owes to the Mongol empire. His short history is easy to follow and full of interesting tidbits to keep the reader engaged. He provides a different perspective, not looking at the Mongols through the lens of the West. If any of this strikes your interest, then you should give Weatherford\u2019s book a try. ...more I never really thought history can be so much interesting. What past is there behind us!

He had a very rough childhood and his father died when he was very young leaving his mother alone with his brothers to take care. Undoubtedly, he was extremely intelligent and also a military genius. He used psychlogy during wars. His enemies used to fear him and because of that they found better to surrender than to be attacked. Nobody in the history has ever conquered as vast empire as Genghis Khan did. He truly was the greatest leader the world has ever known. He had the recognition of the skills of others, people or soldiers were promoted on the basis of their work or skills they possesed not by their cast. In those times Genghis khan was very much tolerant about different religions being practised, there was a freedom to practise any religoin. In those times he allowed their women to rule the empire while they were busy in fighting. After his death, his grandson Kublai Khan expanded the empire who I believe had qualities of Genghis Khan. Where others found not much use of paper note, he found that system valuabe. History is inspiring, history is unfair, history is painful, history is filled determination and vision of the goal. Having also read the biography of Alexander the great it is still not justifiable rank anybody on the basis of their leadership. They both respected women, they both were focused to destroy their enemies but not their families, they both cared for others... Jawaharlal Nehru wrote to his daughter Indira, who would herself grow up to become prime minister of India, it would be foolish not to recognize the greatness of Europe. But it would be equally foolish to forget the greatness of Asia. Nehru depicted Genghis Khan as a part of an ancient struggle of Asian people against European domination. He described Genghis Khan as a cautious and middle-aged man and every big thing he did was preceded by thought and preparation, they won great victories on the field of battle because of their discipline and their organzation. And above all it was due to the brilliant captainship of Genghis Khan. He also concluded that Genghis Khan without doubt, the greatest military genius and leader in history. Alexander and Ceaser seem petty before him. I couldn't agree more! ...more This is a very entertaining, thought-provoking and well-written book.

No doubt the image of the This is a very entertaining, thought-provoking and well-written book. The relatively low rating reflects my lingering skepticism. The back of the book itself calls it \"revisionist history\" and Weatherford is not a historian, but an anthropologist. Although to give him his due, he was part of a team that helped translate The Secret History of the Mongols and explored the Mongolian homeland once it was no longer restricted in the wake of the breakup of the Soviet Empire. No doubt the image of the Mongolians merit another look and some corrections from the simplistic view of them as the \"quintessential, bloodthirsty barbarians.\" Yet even within his sympathetic, nearly hero-worshiping account, one can find glimmers of the reasons for the view of Genghis Khan as a great destroyer. Though Weatherford disputes the numbers, contending the Mongols didn't have the numbers and resources to make it possible, he noted that the more conservative estimates of historians count 15 million dead in five years caused by Genghis' invasion of Central Asia--and Weatherford does admit Genghis was a destroyer of city after city in search of loot. The very word \"slave\" comes from the mass enslavement of slavic peoples by the Mongols who then sold them to the Turks. Weatherford even admits Genghis' Mongols made little contribution to civilization per se--what he claims for them is that they made the modern world because they were \"unrivaled cultural carriers.\" As he put it: The Mongols made no technological breakthroughs, founded no new religions, wrote few books or dramas, and gave the world no new crops or methods of agriculture. Their own craftsmen didn't weave cloth, cast metal, make pottery, or even bake bread: They manufactured neither porcelain nor pottery, painted no pictures, and built no buildings. Yet, as their army conquered culture after culture, they collected and passed on those skills from one civilization to the next. Weatherford claims that this transfusion of culture and trade led to the \"Mongol Global Awakening\" and to the European Renaissance. I'm skeptical frankly of anyone that claims any one reason for the reawakening of the West, or any one source whether a rediscovery of Greek and Roman antiquity, infusion of Islamic learning through the Crusades or Mongolians transmitting Chinese civilization Westward. Nevertheless, I have to thank Weatherford for giving me a fresh perspective into this medieval empire and its possible contributions. ...more To the Young Mongols: Never forget the Mongolian scholars who were willing to sacrifice their lives to preserve your history. \u042d\u043d\u044d \u043d\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0434 \u0438\u0445 \u0442\u0430\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0434\u0441\u0430\u043d. \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0447\u0443\u0443\u0434\u044b\u043d \u0430\u0445\u0443\u0439 \u0430\u043c\u044c\u0434\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044b\u0433 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u0434\u04af\u0440\u0441\u044d\u043b\u0441\u044d\u043d, \u04af\u0439\u043b \u044f\u0432\u0434\u043b\u0443\u0443\u0434\u044b\u0433 \u043e\u043b\u043e\u043d \u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0430\u0441 \u0442\u0430\u0439\u043b\u0431\u0430\u0440\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d, \u0435\u0440 \u043d\u044c \u0431\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0439 \u0438\u0445 \u043b \u0434\u04e9\u0445\u04e9\u043c \u044e\u043c \u0448\u0438\u0433 \u0441\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0433\u0434\u0430\u0432. \u0411\u0430\u0441 \u0431\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u043b\u0436 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0430\u0433\u0433\u04af\u0439 \u0437\u04af\u0439\u043b\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0433 \u04e9\u04e9\u0440 \u04e9\u043d\u0446\u04e9\u0433\u04e9\u04e9\u0441 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0436 \u0431\u0438\u0447\u0441\u044d\u043d \u0431\u0430\u0439\u0441\u0430\u043d. \u0411\u04af\u0445 \u0445\u04af\u043c\u04af\u04af\u0441\u0442 \u0443\u043d\u0448\u0438\u0445\u044b\u0433 \u0437\u04e9\u0432\u043b\u04e9\u0436 \u0431\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0430. \u0423\u0439\u0442\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430\u0439 \u0442\u04af\u04af\u0445\u0438\u0439\u043d \u043d\u043e\u043c \u0448\u0438\u0433 \u0441\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0433\u0434\u0430\u0445\u0433\u04af\u0439 \u0433\u044d\u0434\u0433\u0438\u0439\u0433 \u0430\u043c\u043b\u0430\u044f (\u044d\u0445\u043d\u0438\u0439 2 \u0445\u044d\u0441\u044d\u0433\u0442 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u044b \u043c\u044d\u0434\u0434\u044d\u0433 \u044e\u043c \u0433\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0445 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u043e\u0440 \u0443\u0439\u0434\u0430\u0436 \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0434\u0433\u04af\u0439, To the Young Mongols: Never forget the Mongolian scholars who were willing to sacrifice their lives to preserve your history. \u042d\u043d\u044d \u043d\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0434 \u0438\u0445 \u0442\u0430\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0434\u0441\u0430\u043d. \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0447\u0443\u0443\u0434\u044b\u043d \u0430\u0445\u0443\u0439 \u0430\u043c\u044c\u0434\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044b\u0433 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u0434\u04af\u0440\u0441\u044d\u043b\u0441\u044d\u043d, \u04af\u0439\u043b \u044f\u0432\u0434\u043b\u0443\u0443\u0434\u044b\u0433 \u043e\u043b\u043e\u043d \u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0430\u0441 \u0442\u0430\u0439\u043b\u0431\u0430\u0440\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d, \u0435\u0440 \u043d\u044c \u0431\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0439 \u0438\u0445 \u043b \u0434\u04e9\u0445\u04e9\u043c \u044e\u043c \u0448\u0438\u0433 \u0441\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0433\u0434\u0430\u0432. \u0411\u0430\u0441 \u0431\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u043b\u0436 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0430\u0433\u0433\u04af\u0439 \u0437\u04af\u0439\u043b\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0433 \u04e9\u04e9\u0440 \u04e9\u043d\u0446\u04e9\u0433\u04e9\u04e9\u0441 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0436 \u0431\u0438\u0447\u0441\u044d\u043d \u0431\u0430\u0439\u0441\u0430\u043d. \u0411\u04af\u0445 \u0445\u04af\u043c\u04af\u04af\u0441\u0442 \u0443\u043d\u0448\u0438\u0445\u044b\u0433 \u0437\u04e9\u0432\u043b\u04e9\u0436 \u0431\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0430. \u0423\u0439\u0442\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430\u0439 \u0442\u04af\u04af\u0445\u0438\u0439\u043d \u043d\u043e\u043c \u0448\u0438\u0433 \u0441\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0433\u0434\u0430\u0445\u0433\u04af\u0439 \u0433\u044d\u0434\u0433\u0438\u0439\u0433 \u0430\u043c\u043b\u0430\u044f (\u044d\u0445\u043d\u0438\u0439 2 \u0445\u044d\u0441\u044d\u0433\u0442 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u044b \u043c\u044d\u0434\u0434\u044d\u0433 \u044e\u043c \u0433\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0445 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u043e\u0440 \u0443\u0439\u0434\u0430\u0436 \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0434\u0433\u04af\u0439, \u0433\u044d\u0432\u0447 \u0442\u044d\u0434\u0433\u044d\u044d\u0440\u0438\u0439\u0433 \u0447\u0438\u043d\u044c \u0443\u043b\u0430\u043c \u0438\u0445 \u043c\u044d\u0434\u044d\u044d\u043b\u043b\u044d\u044d\u0440 \u0431\u0430\u044f\u0436\u0443\u0443\u043b\u0436 \u0431\u0438\u0447\u0441\u044d\u043d \u0431\u0430\u0439\u0433\u0430\u0430).

But when invading a kingdom, he would always keep the scholars and artists and artisans and priests alive and well, and he would gather its wealthy and noble people and say: \"it is for YOUR sins that I am sent to your door.

I'm really glad that I found this non-fiction title after having read Urgunge Onon's \"The Secret History of the Mongols: The Life and Times of Chinggis Khan\". The latter is supposedly an English translation from the original text written in Mongolian in the 13th century about Genghis Khan's life by someone close to him, and contains mostly dialogues and descriptive passages. Using that original document as a basis, Weatherford gives a far more coherent and illuminating account of all the life episodes set in historical context, while shedding light on the enormous proximate impact and far-reaching influence that this formidable leader's actions and, to a greater or lesser extent, those of his successors, had on human history. The simple flowing style of writing makes this book an easy read. It is interesting as it is educational. ...more Jack Weatherford is a cultural anthropologist whose speciality is tribal peoples.

He has written several books I value -- 'Indian Givers', 'Savages and Civilization', 'Native Roots'. He brings to this one on the Mongols a knowledge and understanding of tribal cultures -- that in fact is rare in historians. I feel Weatherford can tell you things 'straight' historians can't, on the Mongols -- because of his areas of study. It's true that his account of Temujin's life is an interpreted one -- the way fiction interprets -- and you can either be with or against his guesses. The life story of Temujin isn't 'straight' history in that sense. But again, it is informed by his anthropology... I even thought, too evidently so by his work on Native Americans. Nevertheless, he has more ground than most for his guesses, and you know what you have before you is a narrative with speculation. The latter parts of the book trace ideas about and influence of the Mongols in Europe. This has much you won't easily find elsewhere -- this has things not often said, things unthought of. His claims can be bold, but I think we need boldness here. Better to go too far, when you open up new thought (also my attitude to Christopher Beckwith, Empires of the Silk Road ). He explores us on the Mongols. For instance, he traces the history of our medical usage of the word 'mongol'. Even today people say this for Down's syndrome children (I've heard them. She was a friend, and I didn't howl in her face). With this book Weatherford brought a sympathetic history on 'Genghis' and the Mongols to the bestseller lists, one that argues against our prejudices. That's an achievement. I'd rather see people read this than a few old historians (or not so old) who lack his background in the study of the world's tribal peoples, and lack the equipment on cultures to interpret facts and events. That's what history by an anthropologist can give you. Historians underestimate the differences, and when they make assumptions about 'why this behaviour', they think what people from their own culture might do. I've found this a fault in history, that you need to correct with anthropology, to get to the truth of the past. To give an example: I have low-starred David Morgan's book that is thought of as the standard history on the Mongols. Not simply because it is outdated -- I think it was always poor history, because he is so distant from his subject. It's an outsider's history that does not even seek an inside view, therefore cannot give insight. More concretely, Morgan does not look for a cultural explanation, for a reason that made sense to a Mongol. I hope this explains why I believe people are better off with Weatherford. I'll just add that he's been given Mongolia's highest award for foreigners, the Order of the Polar Star, and the President's Friendship Medal. Mongolia even has a new 'Weatherford Prize' for historiography. I see in the bio on his old college page that his scholarly mission has been to follow in the tradition of Ibn Khaldun, who in the 14th century analysed history in terms of tribal versus civilized societies and values. Ibn Khaldun must have been one of the most original historians who ever lived and his ideas still challenge, are still in contention - and if you ask me, demand more of our attention. That's why we need a Jack Weatherford. ...more \u0411\u0438 \u0443\u0440\u044c\u0434 \u043d\u044c \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044b\u043d \u043d\u0443\u0443\u0446

This book was such an eye opener. I did lose little parts of it to traffic concentration. I have always been fascinated by Genghis Khan but this history goes from the 13th Crntury through to present times when GK'sgreat family continued to try and r ulster the Great Khan's methods and principles. Some expanded his legacy, others didn't do so well but all Momgols would have to be in awe of this man. Recommended to all who like to delve into our past in a scholarly way. This was quite interesting without being very interesting, unfortunately. Theres a lot of cool bits and pieces, but they're thrown off a bit off-hand. The Mongols, we're told, established a common currency and universities, but how did that currency actually function, and what did those universities look like?

The book seems to lay out the theory, without giving any examples or going into the details. What was going on in practice ? What was the shape of the gap? Secondly, while I usually prefer history that's on the far ends of the scale of personal-social, I wish the middle hadn't been so neglected here. There's quite a lot of on society, technology and economics (if not nearly enough) and A LOT on the personal life of Genghis Khan, but the actual history of the empire is kind of brushed over. (Possibly because it's not very complementary.) Theres a few examples of clever Mongolian warmaking, and then something like \"And then they conquered a whole bunch of other places also.\" (Defeats - like Ein Jalut - go amusingly undetailed.) Or \"...and then the Ming were in power.\" I suppose this is to go with the unabashed positive angle, but it kind of ends up being less a history of the Mongol empire and more \"Mongolian stuff that was pretty cool,\" with big gaps. He blames the Mongol's bad rep entirely on Tamerlane. (Now eagerly awaiting the revisionist history of Tamerlane. \"There was a great deal of architectural innovation in those piles of skulls. Which weren't that big.\") Also, I wish he had been more transparent about the sources. Theres notes at the end of the book, but no note-markers in the text itself, which makes it a pain to look up something specific while reading. He also almost always gives just a sort of final draft of conclusions, without revealing any arguments or inconsistencies that must be bouncing around there, and I suspect would have been fascinating. Still, it's an interesting perspective and I learned a lot of new stuff, even if in a very broad outline sort of way. Things like the Black Death in Asia, the Khawarizmians, the origins of the Golden Horde and so on. Things that are always somehow out of the picture, so recommended for that while mostly frustratedly thinking that things are more complex here than the book encompasses. ...more NGCSU assitant professor of history Timothy May's review of Weatherford's Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World makes it clear that May has made two assumptions: that Weatherford sought to (i) write a book on history, and (ii) that he intended it for Western readers.

Many of Weatherford's actual readers may share May's assumptions, but they shouldn't. It seems clear to me that Weatherford has written a work of anthropology and his intended readers---to whom he dedicated the work---are modern Mongolians. (For example, David Morgan's The Mongols is a book of history for the Western reader. In it, Morgan excused his ignorance of the Mongolian language by explaining that it's too much to ask a historian to learn such a difficult language when almost everything he needs to study the Mongols is written in the much more commonly-known (by Western historians) tongues of Persian and Chinese. I am unimpressed with such arguments.) Weatherford in contrast spent many years crisscrossing the Mongolian landscape with nomads, seeking an understanding of the Secret History . This suppressed work contained the Mongol side of the story, and Mongolians today find themselves in the surprising and happy situation of having a foreigner as an interpreter and champion, one who praises their ancestors' achievements, understates their evils, shows them to be the ancestors of today's world culture---and tells today\u2019s Mongolians their story (or perhaps I should say \"retells\"). These readers can tolerate some fuzziness at the edges of the story (translations of the Persian/Urdu word hazara or the modern history of Baghdad or the pre-Mongol capacity of the Silk Road). This melange of anthropology, history, and cultural geography is writing at its best, connecting worlds that we've walled off due to ignorance or chance or unreason. ...more One of the finest biographies I've ever read.

Further, if only half the information contained within was accurate, it would still be one of the greatest attempts to shed light on the practically forgotten works of history's mightiest conqueror: Genghis Khan. Like most biographers, Weatherford clearly became enamored of his subject and thus, excuses or justifies any truly malicious or simply horrible things the Khan did. I don't find this objectionable, since, in the case of Genghis, vilification is already abundant. Wetherford just gives you the opposite side of the coin and tries to show reasonable and sympathetic motivations for his nearly mythological protagonist. Speaking of mythological; the Great Khan is surely that. Regardless of his shortcomings, the idea that one man could own and control so much of the Earth is staggering. This is no unruly savage. No amount of luck could bring him the power he would ultimately achieve. Further, his brutality is far outmatched by his wisdom. Just consider a handful of his \"gifts\" to the world: Pants (I know, right?) International freedom of religion Social Meritocracy PANTS! Students, if history isn't your thing (and it should be) this is a great place to start. For everyone else; grab this book.

Specifically, the author's introduction explains the history of the long-lost and recently-recovered \u201cSecret History of the Mongols\u201d, which is then referred to without explanation in the body of the text. The author's contention is that Genghis (here pronounced \u201cJeng-gis\u201d) Khan was a enlightened leader of remarkable foresight who was the first to introduce many of the achievements of advanced societies, for example, freedom of religion, paper money, standardized weights and measures, effective postal services, civil service, organized systems of roads, central banking, public schools, and universal education in the local vernacular. Modern-day partisans of cultures that suffered at the hands of the Mongols are (if writings here at Goodreads and elsewhere are any indication) understandably less than enthusiastic about this thesis, but Weatherford might explain that resentment at Genghis is largely misdirected, as much of the cruelty associated with the Mongols was generated by Genghis's inferior successors, of whom only Kublai Khan managed to decelerate the Empire's decline even temporarily. The author's enthusiasm for all things Mongol gives a pleasantly vigorous narrative drive to the story, but it also leads him to an astonishing moment of statistical illiteracy, or maybe mendacity. While discussing capital punishment under the Mongols, at audiobook part 2, chapter 3, time 19:13, it is stated: \u201cIn total, fewer than 2,500 criminals were executed in more than three decades of Kublai's rule. His annual rate fell considerably short of the number of executions in modern countries, such as China or the United States.\u201d While this statement might be true for China, it is probably not true for the United States. The discussion below is based largely on statistics gathered from Wikipedia and guesses made by me. Apologies for any inaccuracies. According to Weatherford, the Mongols may have executed 2,500 criminals during a period of thirty years. It is difficult to guess the average population of the Mongol Empire during that period, but Wikipedia gave a possible figure of 110 million. That works out to 2.27 executions per 100,000 population for the entire period, or an annual rate of .076 per 100,000. Capital punishment in People's Republic of China is difficult to judge because there are no reliable statistics about the number of people executed. Estimates vary wildly, but, based on some numbers on Wikipedia and elsewhere, I chose to start with a low-ball estimate of 3,000 per year, average, over the last thirty years. For the sake of convenience, I used the round number of 1 billion for the average population of the PRC during any given year during the 30-year period. That works out to nine executions per 100,000 population during the period, or an annual rate of .3 per 100,000 per year \u2013 almost 4 times that of the Mongol Empire. The United States executed 1,317 people during 1976-2012. To simplify the mathematics and standardize the unit of comparison, I'm going to call that 1,300 during 30 years. This figure, you might notice, is far lower than the 2,500 figure that Weatherford gives for the same period, even before we adjust for differences in population. Unsurprisingly, the total and annual execution rates, adjusted for population (US population = 2.7 times larger than Mongol population), are lower, too. During the entire period, there were .43 executions per 100,000 population. This works out to an annual rate of .014 per 100,000 per year \u2013 slightly less than one-fifth of the Mongol annual rate, and incidentally roughly one-twentieth of the present-day PRC's rate. Of course, executing merely one-fifth as many people as the Mongol Empire (and merely one-twentieth as many as the PRC) is not an achievement to be inordinately proud of, but nevertheless Weatherford's claim that the annual execution rate in the Mongol Empire was less than that of the present-day USA is almost certain wrong. Rather than attribute this mistake to malice, I was tempted to write off the fact that Weatherford did not take into account the relative size of the populations of the Mongol Empire vs. the USA to a possible case of innumeracy that, while not inevitable, would not be completely unsurprising to find in a professor of anthropology. However, later in the audio book (part 2, chapter 5, time 12:49), when Weatherford wishes to illustrate the severity of the Black Plague (which contributed to the end of the Mongol Empire), he demonstrates a mastery of these same concepts, meaning, he gives statistically-accurate comparisons of mortality rates as a percentage of the total population of the Plague versus various occasions of modern-day slaughter and/or mass illness. In other words, when doing so will strengthen his narrative, Weatherford apparently can understand and manipulate statistics adequately. Where were his editors? They are supposed to keep the author honest and catch things like this. At moments like these, I'm tempted to put the blackest possible interpretation on things, i.e., to say that this case of America-libeling is another example fashionable USA-bashing in academia. However, I try to keep in mind Hanlon's razor, which states: \u201cNever attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\u201d That may sound unnecessarily mean, but that's not my intention. I mean to say that writing a long book is hard and sometimes some of the details skitter away from us, go unchecked, and acquire the dignity of publication. It doesn't mean that the whole book should be disregarded. ...more I finished reading or listening to this book today, and I enjoyed it.

Some said the author was blindly impressed by someone who was basically a murderer. At first I was disappointed in having my impression of the book tainted. Then I thought, OK, let me judge for myself. I recall one factual error that was called out - about the Mongols not riding with raw meat under the saddle to tenderize it. I thought, how do any of us know? There are details of Mongol life written up in a book called The Secret History, but anyone writing all those many years ago may have been biased, forgetful, etc. If indeed some details are incorrect, I think the big picture is still valuable. I don't think Genghis Khan was a murderer as we see it today. Life was completely different from what we know today, and there is evidence that he did introduce some very different ways of life that made a major impact on his world. It sounds like some other leaders were far, far worse. The first half of the story covers Genghis Khan's life, and the latter half covers how his legacy was managed by his children and grandchildren. Then there was a quick hop to the present. The audiobook had an afterward that sounded more like a forward. I wish I had heard it first to put things in perspective, but it actually helped in tying up all the details of the book. I cannot remember all the names and details, but I do realize that what he achieved at that time was incredibly impressive. One of the reviews complained that the book was written by an anthropologist and not a historian. Maybe the anthropologist was the best qualified to look for the human-interest angle. I heard a good story, and that made this quite enjoyable. If there is any issue that I want to investigate for accuracy, I can do so. I see this as a fine introduction to this historical period. One thing that did intrigue me, if that is the right word. It seems like some religious fanaticism in Europe and ignorance about the Mongols may have initiated some of the persecution of Jews. The Mongols also brought the bubonic plague to Europe, and again, the Jews were often given the blame and persecuted quite horribly. Later, in the 1800s and early 1900s, the idea of barbarian Mongols was brought up in support of the \"yellow peril\" fear campaigns. it is so ironic and tragic because it seems the Mongols were very tolerant about religion and different cultures. Fighting ignorance about cultures that differ from our own is one reason why we need good history books to tell more nuanced stories about the past. It felt like this author tried his best to do so. ...more This is the third book in a trilogy that all Western schoolchildren should read to put worl history in proper perspective.

The Mongolian Empire gets a bad rap in the West and all because of a political accident that occurred in 1755. Voltaire was writing a play to skewer the King of France, but out of concern for his life, he substituted Genghis Khan for the King. Thenceforth, the Mongolians were on the outs. In fact, the Mongolian Empire created the modern world as we know it and introduced widely accepted and indeed, revered principles such as diplomatic immunity, freedom of religion, the rule of law, free trade, professional standing armies. He established the world's first census, started the world's first postal system, created the first social service bureaucracy, abolished torture, etc. His daughters ruled their own empires in their own rights. As the author says, \"the scale and scope of Genghis Khan's accomplishments challenge the limits of the imagination and tax the resources of scholarly explanation.\" It was the Mongolian's that built Beijing and ruled China as the Yuan Dynasty. The Forbidden City was built the way it was so that the royal family (of Kubla Khan, Genghis's descendant) could live in gers and keep their horses just as they did on the Steppe. The Mongolian's united China in one economy and one territory, virtually the identical boundaries that exist today. The Mongolians also established the Moghul Dynasty in India, the last outpost against British Imperialism and the source of some of the most deliriously beautiful architecture and art we have a race. It was Genghis Khan's descendant who built the Taj Mahal. It was also his descendants who ruled the Golden Horde in Russia, and the Ilkhanate in Persia. He introduced the Chinese to Europeans and vice versa -- he established global trade routes and commercial contacts that exist to this day. In other words, Genghis rocks, and this book will chill you to the bone. The efforts the West has gone to to destroy his reputation and take credit for his innovations is downright creepy -- including actions taken by the Soviets as recently as the 1960s in the original Mongolian homeland.

Other accomplishments? Genghis created the first east/west trade route, united most of China, and was one of the first rulers to bring civilized peace to much of Asia.

He created an empire four times the size of the Roman Empire. He obliterated the great empire of the Muslims headquartered in Iraq and looted the city and sent all the best materials and scholars and workmen back to Mongolia and China. The *only* reason he did not conquer all of Europe was that the forests prevented him from using his cavalry the way he wanted to. The *big bonus* in this book and the main reason I give it five stars is the story of the grandson, Kublai Khan. This amazing man was one of the greatest leaders ever in history, in fact. The bonus knowledge here were his ideas of improving his country's fortunes by developing trade and to create inventions to trade to others, or to produce something more to trade with those inventions, anything that would work. The author summarized these points better than I have and are the example to any President or leader of a country who wants to grow his country. These few pages should be required reading for every leader because they are incontrovertible. ...more A very interesting examination of the life of Genghis Khan and the empire he created.

His describes, in limited detail, the interaction of the Mongols with the cultures they conquered, as well as the Europeans who were never directly conquered (but who the Mongols had a tremendous influence on, according to the author). I'm not sure if it's a flaw in the book or a problem with the sources, but I constantly wanted more information than the book provided. I was surprised at how much information the author was able to get about the early life of Genghis Khan (an interesting story in itself that he relates in the introduction). However, once the book turns to Genghis Khan's military conquests, it seems to move a bit too quickly. ...more Saw the author on C-SPAN BookTV about six years ago and bought the pb thinking there was no way it could be as engrossing as the segment.

There were many parts where I would have actually liked him to slow down, but with so few (one?) pithy authors/publishers, I'll trust his judgment.
