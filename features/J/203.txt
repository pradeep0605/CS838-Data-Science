Yeah,<---M> if I was to write a book</---M>, I would want to create something as beautiful, clever, magical and unique as this. I cannot guess how current <---A>Libba Bray</---A> fans will respond to this story which is a million miles away from A Great and Terrible Beauty and Beauty Queens and - though I haven't read it - I'd bet money that it's nothing like Going Bovine either. There are so many different elements brought into this story, but they are all well-balanced and manage to complement each other, rather than being scrambled together in a random mish mash. It's such a hard novel to categorise, part historical fiction, part supernatural, part murder mystery, with just the slightest touch of romance. Evie O'Neill is a fabulous character who experiences a great deal of development throughout. When the story starts she is silly and naive, but as time progresses we see her face bigger challenges and begin to change and develop massively. Also, I understand why some people would find the 1920s slang irritating, but I was so charmed by the characters and story that I really didn't mind. One of my favourite elements of the novel is the way in which Bray portrays and develops Evie's relationships with the other characters. I loved the relationship between her and her Uncle Will, two very different people who are forced to team up and work together to solve the murders; what starts out as rather reluctant teamwork becomes a strong bond and I can't wait to see more from them. Evie and Sam's relationship was perhaps the funniest, their dialogue is superb and at times they reminded me of a Bonnie and Clyde-style criminal duo. Similarly, Evie and Mabel's friendship gave me quite a few giggles. And one word that kept popping into my head throughout the entire reading experience is: atmospheric. I was right there in 1920s New York, after the War and before the depression, in a whirlwind of jazz and flappers and speakeasies. Libba Bray breathes magic into this city at the height of its glory whilst also showing the darker side of America at this time with the KKK and xenophobia, the amount of research that must have gone into this book is astounding. There is so much history and mythology and even a touch of politics. I was wowed. In fact, I am still wowed. This is a magical wonderful book that deserves to win a gazillion awards. The only slight problem that I could see annoying people is the slang... well, I ask you to look past it if you can, I believe you'll be glad you did. But, of course, I must also talk about our murderer. I really want to applaud Ms Bray for doing so many different things and getting them all right. Because this book is magical and it is funny and it is clever and it is... really freakin' scary. Books and movies do not scare me often, I avoid horror because I'm mostly immune to it. But this... Naughty John with his creepy whistling and reciting of his freaky little rhyme as he stalks his victims... I slept with the light on. Seriously. Don't laugh. I think, though, what I most want to say is that Libba Bray brings all of these things together into one. Her novel uses history and mythology and humour to create one hell of a story. The characters are vivid and detailed, you can almost feel the city air as you read. Maybe there are faults to be found but they certainly didn't bother me, even the length was completely worth it. I am just blabbing and gushing now so I'm going to stop before I start drooling, but this book is a definite addition to my all time favourites . ...more 9/25/15: Finished re-reading this and it was even better the second time!

So yeah, basically this book left me like this: I've been a die-hard Libba Bray fan ever since the fabulous Gemma Doyle books. I also loved the insane, bizarre adventure of Going Bovine . And Beauty Queens was hilarious\u2013\u2013although I thought it was a bit lacking in the usual strong storytelling element that Bray's other books have. However, that element is back again in <+++>The Diviners</+++> . I just about died of happiness when I first heard of this book. I adore Libba Bray, and I adore the 20's era (and sadly, there aren't a lot of YA books about it). The combination sounded just ... awesome. And oh lord, it was. Just imagine the 20's\u2013\u2013the roaring 20's, with the speakeasies and the flappers and all that wonderfulness. Now imagine it with scary-ass demons and ghosts and murders and psychics and everything mixed in. It's like ... all my favorite things in one book. Okay okay, so a slightly more in-depth look at all the things I love about this book. The plot: I think I've already made this pretty clear, but obviously I loved the plot. I love the mystery of it, the suspense, the horror. Libba Bray masterfully blends the realism of the historical era with the horror/fantasy elements\u2013\u2013just as she did with the Gemma Doyle books and the Victorian era. The story in itself is intriguing on its own, and the historical element also adds a lot to the atmosphere of it. There were a lot of twists in the story that I didn't see coming; and yeah, some of them were a little bizarre, but I was willing to go along with them. Over all, the story was too exciting for me to put the book down. The setting: Obviously, a lot of thought and research went into building the world in this novel. Libba Bray effectively creates the dark, intriguing, gritty atmosphere of the 20's, of all the secret parties and the corruption everywhere. It makes a terrific setup for the fantasy plot. In fact, it made me wonder why there aren't more fantasy books that take place in the 20's. (Seriously, if anyone knows of any, let me know.) The characters: I think the only small issue I had with the characters in this book was that some of them felt a bit reminiscent of Gemma Doyle characters; for instance, Theta reminded me of Felicity and Mabel reminded me of Anne. (Forgive me if I'm mixing up character's names, it's been a while since I read this or Gemma Doyle.) But even so, I found the characters to be well-developed. I found Evie to be a very likable main character. It's refreshing to have a YA female protagonist who is quite imperfect; Evie is far from a pure Mary Sue. She has a lot of flaws and a lot of sass, but she is easy to sympathize with and she noticeably develops throughout the story (without it seeming too rushed or unrealistic). The other characters were also terrific ... and sorry, I'm a little foggy on all their names because I read this months ago. But anyway. There were a lot of characters, but I found they were all properly fleshed-out and had detailed backstories that made them understandable and believable. They each had a role to play, which was important considering there were so many of them. The romance: What I really liked about the romance in this book was that it took me by surprise. Let's just say, for those of you who don't want to read the spoiler ... It didn't go in the direction that I would expect most YA books to go, and instead went in a direction I found more likable and realistic. For those of you who have read it (or don't care about spoilers): (view spoiler) [I was convinced for the first half of the book or so that Evie would fall in love with Sam ... and that was kind of pissing me off because at first he struck me as the stereotypical \"bad boy\" that all the girls in YA books fall for. And although he became more intriguing than that over the course of the story, I still didn't really like the idea of him and Evie as a couple. And I felt so bad for Jericho because he obviously liked Evie and was just walking around like a sad puppy dog and I loved him so much and GAHHH my heart was breaking. And so when Evie actually ended up liking him back it was just like OH THANK THE LORD. So ... yeah. It made me really happy. Also it's kind of weird that he's part-robot or whatever but um ... COOL I guess. I still like them together. (hide spoiler) ] Well okay, I'm still trying to get through all the reviews I have to do (I FINALLY HAVE LESS THAN 10 TO DO, IT'S A MIRACLE), and I think that about sums up my adoration of this book. It may have been my favorite Libba Bray book yet, and it was definitely one of my favorite books of the year. It was exciting, gripping, atmospheric, and full of intriguing characters. Two thumbs up from me, and I can't wait for the second book. :) Pre-review crap under the spoiler: (view spoiler) [ --------- CURRENTLY READING THIS AND I AM SO EXCITED.

This follows the tale of seventeen-year-old Evangeline (Evie) O\u2019Neill, who gets send to New York for a few months to stay with her uncle Will after an unfortunate incident involving a louse and a lothario named Harold Brodie. An incident she, rightfully, is not willing to apoligze for because that would mean explaining what happened. You see, Evie has special powers\u2014 she can tell your secrets simply by holding an object dear to you and concentrating on it. But the aftereffects of her object reading can leave her feeling woozy and sick. \u201cIn New York, she could reinvent herself. She could be somebody.\u201d This review contains *spoilers* . When Evie arrives in New York after having lived in boring old Zenith, Ohio\u2014 it\u2019s certainly a step-up for her. It\u2019s thrilling, unnerving, and enlightening. Speaking of unnerving, Sam Lloyd was introduced when Evie stepped of the train, and I was completely swept off my feet. I mean, I had stars in my eyes and everything\u2026 To be frank, I went into this knowing I\u2019d be completely smitten with Sam Lloyd because I saw some beautiful fanart (by one of my favorite artists)\u2014 and I was certainly not disappointed with his first appearance in the book. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame a fella for kissing the prettiest girl in New York, can you, sister?\u201d Sam\u2019s grin was anything but apologetic. Evie brought up her knee quickly and decisively, and he dropped to the floor like a grain sack. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame a girl for her quick reflexes now, can you, pal?\u201d And I still can\u2019t believe he pick-pocketed her. I mean, I knew he was trouble when he opened his mouth, but I hadn\u2019t guessed what sort of trouble. Source \u201cThick, dark hair with a longer piece in front that refused to stay swept back. Amber eyes and dark brows. His smile could only be described as wolfish.\u201d (She just captured his smile perfectly. Sam Lloyd was painted by the brushstrokes of angels.) And by then Evie finally arrives at the good old Bennington with her friend Mabel Rose, where they both encounter Theta Knight\u2014a glamorous Ziegfeld girl. \u201cEvie decided she liked Theta. It was hard not to be taken by her glamour. She\u2019d never known anyone in Ohio who lived on her own terms, wore silk men\u2019s pajamas into a public lobby, and could toss a dozen roses like they were a cup of Automat coffee.\u201d It\u2019s 1926, and New York is filled with speakeasies, Ziegfeld girls, and rakish pickpockets. The only catch is that living with her uncle Will and his unhealthy obsession with the occult means having to risk her supernatural secret being discovered. I actually found Will's obsession with the mystical so damn interesting. His lectures never felt boring or tedious because they informed me of so much. \u201cWill smiled as the boys chuckled. \u201cAnd yet, there are mysteries. How does one explain the stories of people who exhibit unusual powers?\u201d Evie felt a tingle down her spine. \u201cPowers?\u201d a boy repeated in a skeptical tone bordering on contempt. \u201cPeople who claim to be able to speak to the dead, such as psychics or spiritual mediums. People who say they have been healed by the laying on of hands. Who can see glimpses of the future or know a card before it is played. The early records of the Americas talk of Indian spirit walkers. The Puritans knew of cunning folk. And during the American Revolution, Benjamin Franklin wrote of prophetic dreams that influenced the course of the war and shaped the nation. What do you say to that?\u201d But when the police find a murdered girl (Ruta Badowski) branded with a cryptic symbol and Will is called to the scene, Evie realizes her gift could help catch a serial killer. \u201cRuta was only nineteen years old, and what she knew most was want\u2014a constant longing for the good life she saw all around her.\u201d Getting into Ruta's head while this unspeakably horrendous act happened at the hands of John 'Naughty John' Hobbes, broke a piece of my heart. \u201cNaughty John, Naughty John, does his work with his apron on. Cuts your throat and takes your bones, sells \u2019em off for a coupla stones.\u201d Mr. Hobbes and his cold blue eyes gave me nightmares. And like Evie and her uncle said: \u201cHe\u2019s a monster,\u201d Evie said. \u201cIsn\u2019t he?\u201d Will reached into a bowl of bridge mix. He juggled the candies in his hand without eating them. \u201cIndeed. But that\u2019s a what, not a why. Nothing is done without purpose, however twisted that purpose may be.\u201d As Evie jumps headlong into a dance with a murderer, other stories unfold in the city that never sleeps. And we circle between the lives of a few quaint people: A young man named Memphis is caught between two worlds. \u201cI just need a change of luck is all.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t we all,\u201d Memphis said and moved on.\u201d A chorus girl named Theta who's running from her past. \u201cTheta.\u201d Evie waved a finger in Theta\u2019s general direction. \u201cYou didn\u2019t let me tell your secrets.\u201d Theta wavered for a minute, but she was too drunk to say no. \u201cHere ya go, Evil,\u201d she said, passing over an onyx bracelet shaped like a jaguar. \u201cMy birthday is February twenty-third, and I had one of those limp sandwiches in the kitchen for dinner a million hours ago.\u201d Evie squeezed the bracelet and felt an overpowering sensation of sadness, and a trace of fear. She saw Theta running in the dead of night, her dress torn and her face a wreck. Theta was afraid, so very afraid.\u201d A student named Jericho hides a shocking secret. \u201cYou asked me about how I came to live with your uncle Will. I didn\u2019t answer you right away,\u201d Jericho started. He pulled a heel of bread from his pocket and unwrapped it. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t,\u201d Evie said. Once, she\u2019d been very curious about that. She couldn\u2019t see that it mattered now, with her expulsion imminent. But she was grateful to Jericho for coming after her, for trying to comfort her in his way. She just wanted him to keep talking. \u201cWill you tell me now?\u201d YES!! After he told Evie his secrets, so much of his past conversations made sense (particularly the one with Marlowe). \u201cI told myself a hundred lies. Children do that. It\u2019s amazing the sorts of things you\u2019ll make yourself believe.\u201d But I will admit that I was a little suspicious of Jericho because his childhood sounded a little similar to Naughty John's story: \u201cNaughty John, born John Hobbes, raised in Brooklyn, New York, at the Mother Nova Orphanage, where he was left at the age of nine. A troubled youth, he ran away twice, finally succeeding when he was fifteen.\u201d (They were both at the age of nine when they were left at an Orphanage.) But as always, I was getting way over my head. And that's also the reason why I don't read that much mystery\u2014 I suck at solving it. And my favorite, Sam Lloyd, juggling his ordeals to make it in New York as a self-made man. \u201cSam, too, would make his fortune, and then he\u2019d find the place in the postcard. He\u2019d find her.\u201d He was one of the most interesting characters to read about. The mystery behind his actions made me anticipate his every move. \u201cThis job at the museum had been a stroke of good luck, easier than hustling magic tricks on the streets of Times Square. All he had to do was hold on for a little while\u2014long enough to find out who needed to pay for what had happened to his family. And they would pay.\u201d And that job at the museum was pretty great for my entertainment\u2014 his banter with Evie made my cheeks hurt from smiling so damn much. \u201cAbsence makes the heart grow fonder. Let\u2019s put that phrase to the test, shall we? I\u2019ll get your hat.\u201d \u201cNo can do. Your uncle needs my help. Look at all this stuff\u2014who knew there were so many superstitious charms? Like this\u2014love charm of the Hopi. Oh, I better not let you hold this, sister. You might get goofy for me.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019ll be the day.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m counting on that day.\u201d \u201cI hope you can count pretty high, then,\u201d Evie said.\u201d I knew I was getting pretty goofy for him. Oh, and I also have to mention Evie's dreams because they were one of the most fascinating parts of this book. Especially this next one she had while in the collections room: \u201cShadow people. She\u2019d turn her head just in time to see them retreat into the growing gloom. Whispering, \u201cShe\u2019s one. She\u2019s one of them. You can\u2019t stop us. Nothing can stop us.\u201d Evie turned a corner and was surprised to see Henry also walking the streets, as if looking for someone. His eyes widened when he saw her. \u201cEvie, what are you doing here? Don\u2019t remember me,\u201d he said, and when she looked again, he was gone. \u201d It gave me chills because I was kind of terrified. And then Sam wakes her from her nightmare and manages to make me her laugh after seeing such horrors: \u201cThis fella asked for your uncle, but I told him you were in charge, Your Highness.\u201d Sam returned the bow. Evie replied with an eye-roll. \u201cDo you think you can manage to not steal anything while I\u2019m gone?\u201d \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m trying to steal is your heart, doll.\u201d Sam smirked. \u201cYou\u2019re not that talented a thief, Sam Lloyd.\u201d Also, the love he had for his mother added like 10 extra points in my book: \u201cI thought you said she died.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what they told us. Two years ago, I got this.\u201d He pulled the worn postcard of trees and mountains from his pocket. Evie pretended it was the first time she\u2019d seen it. \u201cPretty. Where is this?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. That phrase on the back, there. It\u2019s Russian.\u201d Evie examined the soft handwriting, obviously feminine. \u201cIt means \u2018little fox.\u2019 It was my mother\u2019s nickname for me. She was the only one who ever called me that. That\u2019s when I knew my mother was alive, and I was going to find her. So I took off. I joined up with the navy for a bit\u2014till they found out I was only fifteen. Then I fell in with a circus.\u201d Like I said, Sam Lloyd has a piece of my heart . Okay, so I was fully rooting for Sam and Evie to get together\u2014 but then Jericho realises somewhere along the road that he's into Evie? And I\u2019m just\u2026 WHAT?? \u201cJericho didn\u2019t know if he would function like a normal man. He only knew that he had all the feelings of one. He wanted Evie. He wanted her desperately. With his hands on hers, he imagined what it would be like to kiss her, to make love to her. She was a little spoiled and often selfish, a good-time girl with a surprising kind streak. She ran toward life full tilt while Jericho held back, not daring. She made him feel alive, and he wanted more of it.\u201d I was unsettled, too, by the feelings she had developed for him. \u201cAre you feeling all right, Jericho?\u201d Evie asked a bit shyly. \u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m\u2026 jake, thanks,\u201d he said, trying out the word with a smile. Sam watched the two of them from the sidelines. Something had happened up in Brethren beyond their finding the pendant and escaping from the new faithful. And Sam didn\u2019t like it.\u201d Right there with you, Sam. I\u2019m not saying that Evie should be with Sam, just that her sudden infatuation with Jericho wasn't to my liking (especially when you put Mabel in the picture). But if you put that aside, just about everything was written so magically and with such a chilling atmosphere. There were so many moments that I loved, especially the ones where all the characters were in the same place. I mean, when I got to see Memphis and Theta interact (among many other happenings), it made my heart soar. \u201cPoet, we\u2019ve gotta scram!\u201d Memphis ran with Theta around a corner, where he pulled her into a telephone booth. She looked up through heavy lashes into Memphis\u2019s handsome face. She\u2019d seen plenty of handsome fellas before, but none who wrote poetry and shared the same strange nightmare.\u201d The fact that they shared the same nightmare was mind-boggling, I'm still in awe. \u201cPapa Charles isn\u2019t gonna like this,\u201d Memphis said. \u201cHe pays the cops enough not to raid his clubs. I hope your friends got out all right.\u201d \u201cMe, too,\u201d Theta said. She still held Evie\u2019s handbag. \u201cI suppose I\u2019d better blow home and see if they did.\u201d Memphis felt his heart sink. He didn\u2019t want the evening to end. \u201cI could take you for a cup of coffee first, if you like. I know I could sure use one.\u201d Theta smiled. It was a sweet smile, almost shy. \u201cThanks, Poet. But I should get my beauty sleep.\u201d Memphis started to say something clever\u2014\u201cWhy? You\u2019re already the best-looking girl in town\u201d\u2014but didn\u2019t. It would seem like charm, and he didn\u2019t want to charm this girl. He wanted to know her. But the magic of their escape couldn\u2019t extend everywhere. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see you in my dreams tonight,\u201d he said instead. \u201cOn that road.\u201d Theta\u2019s smile faltered just a bit. \u201cI suppose I\u2019d feel less scared if you were there.\u201d My heart . Oh, and when they did get together, I got so many butterflies in my stomach (that kiss was everything and more): \u201cIt was passionate, yet tender. A mutual agreement of desire. It was a kiss shared. He was kissing her . He was with her. Memphis pulled away. \u201cEverything jake?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Theta said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Theta looked up at him through thick, dark lashes. \u201cYou stopped.\u201d And not only was Memphis charming and sweet with Theta, he also held his little brother close to heart. \u201cGood old Memphis. Reliable Memphis. Charming, easygoing Memphis. Look-after-your-brother Memphis. Memphis had been the star once. The miracle man. And it had ended in sorrow. He wouldn\u2019t ever risk that again. These days, he kept his feelings confined to the pages of his notebook.\u201d The way he watched out and worried about Isaiah pos-i-tute-ly melted my heart. \u201cIsaiah was all that was left of those happier times when their family was all together, when you only had to walk through the door to hear somebody laughing or calling out, \u201cWho\u2019s that knocking at my door?\u201d and Memphis held tightly to his brother. If anything happened to Isaiah, he wasn\u2019t sure he could survive it.\u201d You could tell that he loved his brother fiercely . Ahh it's really hard trying to not write whole paragraphs on each character because I loved them all. They had moxie, peculiar powers, and charm. Simply put, they were an enigma that I was dying to solve. And not only were the characters some of the most memorable, but the mystery in the air had me on the edge for nearly the whole book. I also felt so excited whenever little plot points connected throughout the story. And can we take a minute to appreciate Miss Lillian and Addie? Because they were such fascinating additions to the ongoing conundrum. \u201cMiss Addie reached out a finger and slid it over the surface of the half-dollar, paling as she did. \u201cSuch a terrible choice to have to make.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Evie asked. \u201cAddie sees into the eternal soul,\u201d Miss Lillian said.\u201d But there are still so many unanswered questions that I'm hoping will be revealed in the next book. Some of my most pressing ones being: \u2022The man in the stovepipe. \u2022Louis and Henry. \u2022Project Buffalo. \u2022James. \u2022The girl with the green eyes. I feel fully invested in all the characters, and I cannot wait to start Lair of Dreams . Though, I am kind of hesitant because of Jericho and Evie\u2014 I'm really not feeling their relationship. Oh, and I loved listening to this song while reading. 4.5 stars *Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate. If you're interested in buying The Diviners , just click on the image below to go through my link.

She may insist no historians were harmed in the writing of her book, but I just don\u2019t see how she\u2019s mastered such command of American history, not just through the facts, but through the way she captures the American experience, that she didn\u2019t torture it out of someone . But just like America, th I don\u2019t know how else to describe The Diviners except to say it\u2019s pretty clear when reading this that Libba Bray set out to write a quintessentially American novel, and - good and bad - she\u2019s succeeded. She may insist no historians were harmed in the writing of her book, but I just don\u2019t see how she\u2019s mastered such command of American history, not just through the facts, but through the way she captures the American experience, that she didn\u2019t torture it out of someone . But just like America, this is a book full of contradictions, it has some of the most complex, evocative writing I\u2019ve ever seen for historical fiction, yet at the same time relies on some oversimplistic, almost stereotypical characters - I\u2019m seriously conflicted. There\u2019s no nice way to phrase this, so I\u2019m just gonna come right out and say it - I\u2019m sorry, but Evie O\u2019Neill is a ditz. And that really puzzles me, why, despite the strength of her writing, Bray has to try so hard to fit everything into some 1920s stereotype. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but after reading the superb writing that really showcases how much Bray gets the Roaring Twenties, I want to see some smart characters that does that excellent writing justice, not some shallow socialite obsessed with \u2018dizzy water\u2019 and partying at speakeasies, who thinks everything is \u2018the cat\u2019s meow\u2019 or \u2018the duck\u2019s quack\u2019. Who talks like that? It doesn\u2019t even work the first time, much less the hundredth, by which time the dialogue seriously grated on my nerves. I kept expecting more from Evie\u2019s character, kept wondering if she really is that shallow, and my unfortunate conclusion is, well, yes, she is that shallow, there really isn\u2019t anything more to her, despite Bray\u2019s attempts to incorporate some emotion and mystery with her dead brother and an antagonist in the villainous Naughty John. She just never behaves like a relatable character, or is anything more for me than a 20s stereotype who keeps spouting annoying catchphrases and obsessing over the New York social scene. Evie\u2019s by far my biggest problem with the story, but she definitely isn\u2019t my only problem. To fill out the flat characters department, look no further than presumptive love interest Sam Lloyd, who fills the cad \u2026 er fella (another word that\u2019s reduced to a 20s sound bite) role to a tee, his only interesting bit of character development being more of a hint of what\u2019s to come in the sequel. Or other presumptive love interest <---C>Jericho Jones</---C>, the wooden, straight shooter with, predictably, a mysterious secret that bizarrely isn\u2019t of the paranormal variety but somehow sends this series careening down a steampunk path? I guess it\u2019s really a weird mix of science and mysticism. Oh, and lest I forget, Evie spends most of the book trying to set Jericho up with her best friend Mabel Rose (Evie\u2019s own relationship with Jericho is pretty much platonic almost the entire way through) until Mabel happens to bump into someone else and, well the rest is easy to guess. The Roaring Twenties may have been one glamorous and exciting period, but these characters just didn't do it for me. Well, I like Mabel\u2019s interesting and surprisingly emotional communist parents side plot that really captures a big issue of the day, I\u2019ll give the book that. But all these side plots, that really is another problem with The Diviners . So many times, I\u2019m following what Evie is doing, or another creepy scene with Naughty John, and the book would all of a sudden cut off to something else, whatever alternative main character Memphis Campbell and his own special powers related problems are or some other background story. It\u2019s really a symptom of a larger problem, Bray\u2019s blatantly setting up The Diviners as the first in a series, and she\u2019s sacrificing the flow of this book in order to spend too much time developing a character, Memphis, that I really didn\u2019t feel was all that integral to the plot at all. The entire time, the story\u2019s telling me that the Diviners as a group is what\u2019s important and planting all these hints and reminders that something big, bigger even than Naughty John, is coming, and the entire group will be needed to stop it, but what that actually did was just really distracted me from enjoying the actual story of this book. Because it turns out, Memphis really has almost nothing to do with the Naughty John story at all, Sam and Evie\u2019s other friend Theta very little, and as The Diviners is already a fairly long read, following the stories of these secondary characters when it turns out their stories have almost no bearing on the actual plot feels like a chore. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t feel the way I do if certain sections of the book weren\u2019t just so darn good that I just couldn\u2019t get enough of certain chapters. It\u2019s hard to describe, but I really feel Bray has captured the soul of America, as Evie explores Naughty John\u2019s mysterious past, Bray\u2019s exploring American history from the Revolutionary War to the Civil War to the Gilded Age, capturing the hopes and dreams and ideals that make America tick, whether it\u2019s the mix of cultures and religions or the Second Great Awakening or racial attitudes towards African Americans from the Civil War up to the Roaring Twenties, it\u2019s all here, in this book, seamlessly incorporated in the plot. And Bray excels at iconography, there\u2019s a character named Gabriel who\u2019s an excellent trumpet player and the way she works him into the religious motifs was just shockingly inspired. And whether it was the wind carrying its warnings or Naughty John\u2019s haunted mansion working its evils or Evie and Mabel\u2019s neighbors Miss Lillian and Miss Addie offering their creepy insights on the goings on, the story could get so dark and spooky and the imagery so spot on that I absolutely hate how the flat characters and sequel setting detours Bray forces on me sort of ruin that effect. I have a hard time rating The Diviners because half the book is utterly amazing and the other half is just meh. Parts of the book are creatively on fire, but they\u2019re sandwiched between sections that are utterly tedious stereotypes. I don\u2019t know what my overall opinions of this book are, I really don\u2019t. ...more ..Finally released from \u2018Starbucks\u2019 before midnight, I was caught in last pages of The Diviners , & heavy rain Storm hit Alexandria that evening.

Day One p.59 What the Hell ?!! 1926 !!!??? The elegant novel I bought cause I liked its cover , I thought will be about Masons because of the Eye symbol.. it turned into social horror set in the 20s. Breath..it may be just the beginning .. also don't deny it's interesting with this Ouija board and all, the Jazz music playing constantly in the \u2018Starbucks\u2019 cafe helping a bit living it .it'll be alright. \"few pages later\" WHAT THE F*#^..I MUST do FULL researches for books I'm buying next time.. It's all in the 20s, with the Slang that my dictionary won't get..I hate that .. Jake, Swell, fella, Pos-i-tute-ly and Blue Noses... Well, BLUE MY SHORTS...-SKI :( I spend nearly 4 Hours reading first 35 Pages, to get used to the language.. And this spoiled Evie , though she has an interesting supernatural talent, yet her attitude is very spoiled. I was sooo angry ,too much of Florenz Ziegfeld and Fitzgerald and flapper and fellas ,Revue and Speakeasy ( I know I mention the latter at the beginning of the review,but I didn't know this word before ) and number runners and gigs!!.. what's up with that? I was exhausting with that much of vocabulary and too much similar strange names and slang.. On the other hand, There's very detailed beautiful drawing for NYC -adorned with the heavy vocabulary- and the atmosphere of the 20s. The characters are very fine detailed too, it reminded me with J.K. Rowling's writing style which I adore...But is the 500+ pages of The Diviners worth this Exhausting Read ? Day Three p.154 Well it is worth it indeed..with some search of New York pictures from the 20s -and recently watching Buz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby - the experience got much better.. I was already used to the slang and was glad that Mr. Will hates it like me :) Speaking of Mr. Will Fitzgerald , Evie's Uncle ..He reminded me much of Dan Brown's Robert Langdon with all of his knowledge of Occult and Symbols..and the creepy rich supernatural history of US. He is asked to help solving a mystery of creepy horrible murders...and Evie's special supernatural talent helping him.. That's a good story to catch my fully attention. And it was getting darker, much complected.. It's really worth it..I'm enjoying it so far.. Day Six p.275 Half way through, It's not a novel..It's a 1920s NYC living experience... I became actually, literally living in the 20s' New York. Living in this creepy Bennington Building, going to theaters, watching the motion pictures starring Charlie Chaplin, going to clubs and illegal speakeasy for some shots of giggle water. Political groups clashing with the government, wounds aching because the loved one lost to the Great meaningless War.. All while investigating horrible crimes with Uncle Will all the same time.. Looking for Solomon\u2019s Comet and wondering what is this Coming Storm.. Nightmares and creepy feelings, Necromancy, Tarot Cards and special Gifts.. a real creepy mix.. With some Funny moments that light up the dark a bit\u2026 Amazing Read. Day Twelve p.463 \u201cThere are doorways between this world and the world of the supernatural. Ghosts. Demonic entities. The unexplained and undefined. The mysterious. I\u2019ve whole books and archives dedicated to it.\u201d \u201cThere is no greater power on this earth than story.People think boundaries and borders build nations. Nonsense\u2014words do. Beliefs, declarations, constitutions\u2014words. Stories. Myths. Lies. Promises. History. \"This, and these..they\u2019re a testament to the country\u2019s rich supernatural history.\u201d It's amazing how big these small words between the Novel\u2019s lines that makes it a real deeper meaning novel. There's a great mix of Dark Fantasy and relate it to our Real World \"Urban or Contemporary Fantasy\u201d Religious Movments -------------- \"Spirits are attracted to seismic energy shifts, chaos and political upheaval, religious movements, war and invention, industry and innovation. There were said to be a great many ghost sightings and unexplained phenomena reported during the American Revolution, and again during the Civil War. This country is founded on a certain tension.\u201d And that time, 1920s, with the Great War, the mind-blowing new inventions as electricity and wireless, the religious and politics movements.. All that was a great place to attract spirits.. Specially the Evil ones... And talk about the great chaos we're facing in Egypt now.. And all of that, in a Nation that's built by different believes and religions that can make huger spirits chaos. But that's not all, The Comets -------- \"Comets are powerful portents! The ancients believed them to be times when the veil between this world and the next was thinnest.\" Well that last one freaks me out since I was reading other Arabic novel about a theory similar to that, the relation between Comets and Evil Demons which is even mentioned at the Holy Qura'an. Again, that's not all the creep you'd get here. The Novel is Getting Darker... Full with Supernatural and Metaphysics, Amazingly describing the Nightmares and the creepy atmosphere of the time, like The two old creepy ladies at the building, the graveyards, the abounded house, Chinatown and the hostess girl in green eyes..the creepy festival.. and so more..more real.. That Eugenics Test with the creepy enthusiastic nurse. -and as I felt about it, THAT was real, the author said so at the notes, and google it, it's there That reminded me with the best element of X-Men with all the diviners -mutants- investigations, the rejection and considering them \"freaks\".. all the like of Harry Potter as well. Also the part with The Brethren place, their church and community reminded me with an episode of The X-Files that hunts me years before. All that tangled with The REAL 1920s New York. in a way the author called \u2018 Narrative Tinkering \u2019 That reminds me of why I love that color of fantasy that I got in love with because of Harry Potter ... and this symbols biblical killer chase like Robert Langdon 's adventures...and nice vast variety of sweet characters that you'd feel as if you're living with them, sometimes cracked me up with laughter, \u201cTo Mabel! You could at least try to be polite.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not interested in being polite. It\u2019s false. Nietzsche says\u2014\u201d \u201cLeave Nietzsche out of this. He\u2019s dead, and for all I know he died of rudeness.\u201d Evie fumed. I simply loved it..if you sum up you'll find it gets the best elements of EVERYTHING I love in fictions and Horror.. \"Harry Potter\" , \"The X-Files\" , \"Dan Brown's Robert Langdon\" , \"X-Men\" , \" 666 Park Avenue\" even the great horror show \"American Horror Story\" So I have to Thank you Libba Bray for the cinematic, living characters and places.. your describing the Evie's \u2018Trance State\u2019 when she holds something to read, is exactly like describing my actual state of reading...when I read a good novel I'm actually living and seeing it , the atmosphere and the cast I choose for the characters. And here I am, 12 days living there...New York 1926 Day Fifteen \"Last Day\" p.578 With no spoilers..That's a very good climax, yet, I was shocked\u2026it didn't end. About 40% of the book and may be more is a base for the upcoming volume and not direct related to this one's mystery. Is it bad surprise? Never It's still amazing and thrilled me, Now I want more volumes, even more than a trilogy, why not a 7 parts like Harry? Want more stories of the characters I loved , the creepiest events And the Howling Storm that yet to come. Libby made a great base that she can build a wonderful series that can get its place at the Biggest Fiction Series Ever Made. The Ending Scene gave me a real Nightmare I add at the 2nd book Pre-Review :) The God --------- One important note before I wrap up..it may disturbed me a bit all the anti-God talks in the novel.. BUT at the same time I feel the series got something Good about God after all..I may can't put finger on it but it's there...I felt it in Memphis' pray for his brother by the end.. A Line by the end shows that usually our choices that get wrong..not all the wrong is just from God.. \u201cMemphis John, you need to get beside me. We\u2019re gonna pray for your brother now, pray the woman hasn\u2019t brought the Devil to this house.\u201d Memphis dropped to his knees next to his aunt at Isaiah\u2019s bedside, but he didn\u2019t like it. Why? he thought. Why should I pray to God? What has he done for me or my family? He felt the anger coming up inside, pricking into tears. \u201cI won\u2019t do it.\u201d Octavia\u2019s shock faded to a grim determination. \u201cI promised your mama I would look after her boys, and I intend to do that. Now pray with me.\u201d Memphis exploded. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask God why he took my mother? Why don\u2019t you ask him when my father\u2019s coming home? Why don\u2019t you ask him what he has against my little brother?\u201d He wanted to hit something or someone. He wanted to burn up the whole world, heal it, and burn it down again. He expected Octavia to yell at him for blaspheming the Lord and throw him out of the house. Instead, she said softly, \u201cGo on and get yourself some chicken from the icebox. I\u2019ll do the praying, and we\u2019ll talk after,\u201d and it was almost worse. Octavia bowed her head. \u201cLord Jesus\u2026 please protect this boy. He didn\u2019t know what he was doing. He\u2019s a good boy, Jesus\u2026\u201d But this part show may be a little hidden better idea. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, though he didn\u2019t know who he was saying it to, or why. I don't know but I got a good felling about it after all..I loved also this part about how wrong the man can be.. that we who choose the wrong , every time.. Will wanted her to go inside. Then he would send her back to Ohio, where her parents would also tell her to go inside, in effect. She was tired of being told how it was by this generation, who\u2019d botched things so badly. They\u2019d sold their children a pack of lies: God and country. Love your parents. All is fair. And then they\u2019d sent those boys, her brother, off to fight a great monster of a war that maimed and killed and destroyed whatever was inside them. Still they lied, expecting her to mouth the words and play along. Well, she wouldn\u2019t. She knew now that the world was a long way from fair. She knew the monsters were real.

Draft it out and let me know when you are done.\" **************************************** Try as I might--summer afternoon, comfy deck chair, an open-ended day just made for endless reading--I was unable to enjoy The Diviners. Libba Bray did a tremendous amount of research on the roaring 20s in New York. The trouble is, she wanted to share all of it. This is a elaborate setting badly in need of characters and plot. Someone took their cardboard cut-outs from the \"Young Adult Paper Doll Book\" and inserted into the pretty-flapper-Great Gatsby-land. There's the Ingenue who thinks she's experienced. The square but supportive friend. The emotionally reserved uncle (includes one bonus secret past). The charming, rakish thief. Young quiet intellectual male hiding secret affection. The earnest detective. The possibly-scary elderly ladies living next door. The religious black woman. (view spoiler) [The little boy speaking mysterious truths. The runaway wife. The gay piano player (aren't they all). The revival-tent preacher. (hide spoiler) ] . About the only one of interest is the Poet-cum-Numbers runner. Plot is straight out of \"innocent-investigates-murder\" only it took until page 80 to get the first murder. Up until then we're treated to extensive description of our heroine drinking, partying and sassing. Gee, I wonder if her experiences will help her grow up? By the time we find a dead body, I had been up and down out of my chair about eight times, looking for other things to entertain me. (view spoiler) [When Ingenue investigates haunted mansion with her best friend--while serial killer is on the loose--is anyone shocked? When Unc Will is hauled away in chains, is anyone surprised? I can just tell someone is going to be kidnapped and used in an awful ritual before special powers save the day. (hide spoiler) ] When I got to the second young man romancing our heroine (oh, it's not a spoiler--this is a modern young adult book), I was ready to stab myself. I tend to read for three things: plot, character and language. Usually at least one can sustain me through a book, but that just didn't happen today. Characters here lack subtlety, dimensionality and interest. Plot was so routine that absolutely nothing about it surprised me. Language that is mostly defined by 20s vernacular and only devoted to creating the setting. There's not even a wider philosophical ideas here to create the illusion of a thoughtful approach. Belief creates reality, yada yada, except when it doesn't. Bray breaks narrative character in a couple sections to lecture the reader on 1920s racism. How educational! Redeeming factors: ability to create a sense of place in time in America. Mostly. Mostly the movie perception of it, actually, of flappers and haircuts and kids on the corner selling newspapers and sneaking alcohol everywhere. Okay, so it mostly succeeds at writing Great Gatsby scenes. One and a half stars--it completely missed me, even though it should have been a three star at least, given the sassy female, the fantastical elements, the description of period New York--all ingredients that usually appeal to me.

I'm not sure if it's just this *type* of scary that I can't really do or if I'm just sensitive to it but I was pretty terrified reading the end of this book. I think it mostly had to do with the twisted version of the Bible and the really intense insane occult that was a pretty big part of plot events. It was just a little too sacrilegious for me and while I realize that it's not poking at Christianity but rather a super twisted version of it, it felt like it was closer to it. Also felt a bit too close to something a real demon (soz if u don't believe in this I do so it influences my opinion) could actually do somehow? IDK THESE IS JUST MY RAMBLY FEELINGS OKAY OKAY. Probably none of that made sense and I might take it down later, but I think this might've just been a little too much for me. Some people will love this and probably very few will have the issues I had, it's a personality and beliefs thing. Overall good but a bit too much in the scare department for me.

However, sometimes, when writing a review for the books I give five stars (or really any other rating), I realize that there were some certain things in the book I'm reviewing that would result in me taking away stars from my initial rating. Of course, there are some instances where I fully acknowledge the faults a book has, but give it five stars nonetheless, the most recent case being with Ultraviolet . But then, of course, there are some instances where, even if I love a book to bits, I fully acknowledge its faults and just can't give it the full five stars. This is the case with The Diviners . As a disciplinary act, young and rebellious Evangeline - or, as she is more commonly called, Evie - O'Neill is sent from Ohio to New York City by order of her parents, to live with her uncle, Will Fitzgerald, curator of The Museum of American Folklore, Superstition, and the Occult - or, as that is more commonly called, The Museum of the Creepy Crawlies. However, unbeknownst to her parents, Evie is incredibly anxious to escape from the clutches of her parents and those in her hometown who judge her to the buzzing New York City, where people are bound to accept her rebellion and promiscuity. And maybe, while she's there, go to a speakeasy or three . But Evie also has a secret: a special ability that may just come in handy as she is thrown into the crazy world of The City That Never Sleeps, as well as a creepy and ritualistic string of murders. Going into The Diviners , I wasn't entirely sure what I would get considering the murder mystery, only provided with the knowledge that the murderer ended up creeping out quite a few friends of mine. Me, however, being the 'nothing can scare me!' person that I proclaim myself to be , didn't expect much from the murderer, and was at least hoping to find an entertaining plot behind the murders and murderer that were clearly not going to scare me. Y'know, 'cause I'm tough like that. I stand corrected. I'm going to play the 'I didn't know it would be like that ' excuse as the reason why the murderer creeped me out so much (because I need to save my image, don't I?), and then I'm going to pretend this never happened and go on with saying a fictional murderer never scared me. (I got'sta save my face, people!) So, yeah. Watch out for Naughty John. He's climbin' in yo windows, he's snatchin' yo people up. Now, if you're like me, and before even picking up The Diviners , you were intimidated by its daunting length (because, seriously people, this book is a weapon), then fear no more. Once you get past the first hundred or so pages, which is mostly exposition (but it's in no way boring to read or a slog to go through), you will find yourself turning pages faster than you'd think you could turn pages. The only reason it took me a whole week to finish The Diviners is because I've been extremely busy (explanation for my absence on Goodreads and my lack of content on the blog lately). Another thing, aside from its length, that intimidated me about The Diviners was its multiple narratives. If you've read any of my reviews for books with multiple narratives, you'll know that they rarely work out for me in the end. I like to think it's because the author generally isn't skilled enough to write multiple narratives, while making the narratives distinguishable, and not just because I'm an overall 'impossible to please' reader (though this book is pretty much a testament to that being false, no?). Ultimately, my intimidation concerning the multiple narratives in The Diviners was to no avail, because the multiple narratives were expertly handled. I was able to easily distinguish the narratives from each other, and I can say that each narrative had its own little thing that made reading it never be a chore, unlike some other novels with multiple narratives. *eyes Defiance * The characters in The Diviners , especially Evie, are incredibly well fleshed-out and are met with an immense amount of character development throughout the novel, and the relationships between Evie and her friends, and Evie and her love interest, were also expertly handled. And, while we're on the topic of Evie's relationship with her love interest, I just want to point out to all you young-adult writers out there: this is how you write a realistic relationship. I want the main relationship in The Diviners to be taken as an example for young adult authors everywhere. This relationship is well-developed, believable, and there is not an 'I love you' in sight. However, through all of this gushing, there is a fault to be found in The Diviners that, unfortunately, was enough for me to lower my rating by half a star. That fault being that the last fifty pages (give or take) were so rushed, and that I really wished Bray would have taken her time with the conclusion. I mean, she wrote a nearly six-hundred page book, I think she'd be forgiven for writing a more thorough conclusion (one that doesn't leave me confused, maybe?). I realize that there are upcoming additions to come following The Diviners , but honestly, I think this could have easily been wrapped up in one book, while leaving readers satisfied, as opposed to stretching it out in a series, and leaving readers unsatisfied with the ending of this. But, despite the rushed and confusing final fifty pages of The Diviners , I really did love the five-hundred or so pages prior, which, when putting into perspective, really is something, isn't it? I only hope that Bray is able to maintain the quality of The Diviners throughout the series, without going into overkill, because The Diviners was an incredibly fun, creepy, and thrilling read, and I'm eager to read more. ...more THIS BOOK IS ASTOUNDING!

It was gorgeous and quite fascinating. Besides the creepiness, there is still a sense of ambition and dazzle in it. Obviously, the author did a really good research on all the things this novel contains. It was beautifully-written, and honestly, I didn\u2019t have a problem that it was too long. I know that a lot of readers weren\u2019t able to enjoy it due to the thickness of the book, but I just adore it that way. It shows how different their vocabulary back then was compared to ours in this age. I was kind of annoyed at first maybe because I wasn\u2019t used to it. There were times that they added \u201c-ski\u201d to the last word of a sentence, said stuff like pos-i-tute-ly (which my edition of Merriam-Webster\u2019s dictionary doesn't even recognize) and swell (which means \u201cfine\u201d). And I\u2019ve never heard or read of anyone who calls their friend \u201cPie Face\u201d. But it was fun to read. It\u2019s new, interesting, and refreshing to me. The plot was so thrilling! I didn\u2019t expect where it was leading me. The synopsis didn\u2019t say too much about it, so I was very surprised on how the story developed. My only problem with it is that Memphis and Theta didn\u2019t get that much involved in the Pentacle Killer Case. It was as if they had their own storyline. I think their side of things was building up for the next book so I should go read it and see for myself. I didn\u2019t get attached to anyone of the characters yet but they are really entertaining to read about. Evie O\u2019Neill is very lovely and she knew most of the time what she wanted, and she\u2019ll do everything to get it. She lived her life freely and bravely, and showed how much she loved the people around her in her own unique ways. I love spunky characters like her. I definitely enjoyed reading about her. Theta Knight shattered my heart! At first I thought that she was really boring, that her mysterious character didn\u2019t work for me. But then when I came to the chapter of her story as to how and why she arrived at New York, I just wanted to comfort her. There was a greater depth to her character and I was drawn to it. I\u2019M ON THE EVIE-AND-JERICHO SHIP!!!!!! Like Theta, Jericho Jones was a bit mysterious and I was bored by his character at first because he was a bit shy and innocent-like. But when I finished the book, I could say that he is one of my favorite characters. He was almost as broken as Theta, and that lured me towards him. Sam Lloyd is a character that I truly enjoyed. He is carefree. He makes his scenes in the book interesting just by being himself. I am very excited to get to know him better. Will Fitzgerald - I want an uncle like him. He is the kind of adult that is not too strict. Who doesn\u2019t want an uncle like that? He\u2019s also really clever when it comes to his knowledge of the occult and the supernatural. I could spend a few hours every day talking about things like that with him. Henry Dubois IV has a mouthful of a name that I don\u2019t remember what his middle name was and I'm not sure if I got his name right. Anyway, of all the characters, Henry is the one I would like to hug! He\u2019s a minor character but he has a very good impact on Theta\u2019s character. He\u2019s just so kind! He did too much for her and I am just in awe of his goodness. Mabel Rose is the only character I didn\u2019t like! I would gladly push her out of a hotel window. Why? She didn\u2019t have a spine! Her parents dragged her to rallies. Evie got to bring her to parties, and then Mabel would blame her afterwards if they get caught or if something bad happened, although she agreed to go out with her. She can\u2019t even confess her love for the guy she wanted! She needed all the help of the world! What the actual fudge?! I would like to apologize to the readers who liked her but she just annoyed me so much. I am very fond of Naughty John. He is very eerie which fascinates me. (view spoiler) [Was the character of John Hobbes based on the serial killer H.H. Holmes? They have obvious similarities. (hide spoiler) ] Lastly, I would like to point out that I don\u2019t get Blind Bill Johnson. What he wants to happen is still a mystery to me. I expected too much from the ending, and I\u2019m honestly a bit disappointed. I think it could have been darker and little bit more hopeless. The good thing about it is that it created a nice build up for the next book. It opened up questions to all the unsolved mysteries mentioned like Sam\u2019s mother and her whereabouts. HOPEFULLY these things get answered in the sequel. Overall, this book was really awesome. I highly recommend it! ...more **Note: I laugh every day about the fact that this is one of the first negative reviews on the page for this book. Not really sure how that happened.

I love it. Two stars is a shockingly low rating, I know. Sorry bout it. Here is a list I've composed, honestly expressing why I didn't enjoy this book. I'm guessing not all of my complaints will seem significant to you, so bear that in mind. 1. Right off the bat I have to admit that the biggest negative factor for me is the character of Naughty John. He was effectively creepy, scary, and haunting to read about, so I'm sure many of you will find him to be a positive factor-- but for me Ms. Bray crossed some line when she came up with him. I promise I'm not a person who gets all sensitive over weird spirituality in books -- I read all kinds of fantasy, and on a regular basis -- but as a Christian the level of demonic influences in this book was really hard to stomach. Obviously this will not be an issue for a lot of readers, but I thought that element of the story went way too far. Edit in 2016!!! I no longer really give a care about religion (sorry God), but if you do, this issue might still be significant for you. I do think it's interesting that Bray is so committed to stepping on Christians' toes, though. I thought about it, and the thing she likes to do is take Jesus' words, twist them, and put them in the mouth of an evil character in order to try to point out the inherent ~evilness~ of Christianity or something. She was doing that back in the Gemma Doyle trilogy, and she does it here. Again, I don't really care anymore, but I do think it's a little weird that she's done that in multiple books. Like, find a new way to piss off Christians already. Get creative. ;) 2. Evie, the protagonist, was irritating and vapid. Part of this springs from another problem -- the amount of flapper slang clogging up the book was absolutely ridiculous and became annoying about 15 pages in. Her way of speaking wasn't helping matters, but I think I can honestly say that even if Evie hadn't been such a caricature of the 1920's I would have found her repulsive. She never demonstrated more than surface-level care for anyone other than herself, and constantly made the stupidest decisions it was possible to make. 3. The side characters seemed to consist as a list of stereotypes and basic personality traits, rather than being fleshed out and real. I had a hard time remembering who was who at times. This wasn't helped by the spastic POV switching, which disrupted the flow of the novel hugely and often transported me to the perspective of a character whose experiences were basically irrelevant to the larger plot. (*cough*Memphis*cough*) And even when we stuck with the main character group, their interactions were underdeveloped. I couldn't sense the flavor of their relationships, so to speak, meaning the specific individual friendships between characters. They all interacted with each other in basically the same way. Thus, at the end when a romance was squeezed into the plot, it came out of nowhere and only succeeded at making me feel really uncomfortable. Awk. 4. Ms. Bray seems incapable of writing more than ten pages at a time without hitting the reader over the head with her own personal beliefs. Injecting your perspective into a story is virtually impossible, I know, but Bray does it more than most authors. I've only ever read the Gemma Doyle trilogy before this, but through that reading and seeing reviews for her other books, I think this is a pattern in Ms. Bray's writing. If she wants to present biased and one-sided arguments for her own beliefs, I think she should write political speeches, not novels. Again, sorry bout it. 5. The exploration of the unique superpower that each character possessed was minimal. You wouldn't think teens with crazy powers could be uninteresting, but you'd be wrong. I'm currently watching the TV show Misfits, and I'd estimate that the exploration of powers on that show is roughly 1,000 times more creative and intriguing than what's found in this book. 6. Lastly for the negatives is the sheer size of this book. Clocking in at over 500 pages, it was a real undertaking to read and even trying to hold it hurt my wrists after awhile. Personal opinion: the story within did not warrant such mass. I think that if 150 pages or so were cut out, the book wouldn't suffer (it might even have improved). It's impressive that Ms. Bray wrote such a long book, but I would find it more impressive if she'd written one that was paced well. Okay, hopefully we've all emerged from that list unscathed. If you're mad at me for desecrating your beloved book, now please tune in to my list of positives. These are the things I thought were effective in the story, even though I overall didn't enjoy it: 1. First and foremost, the writing. Ms. Bray's writing is bursting with confidence and a sureness that immediately assures the reader that they've picked the right book. The first chapter impressed me immensely, and there were plenty of spots throughout that continued to impress me. She's definitely grown a lot as a writer. 2. Although I've listed this as my biggest negative, I have to mention how horrifying the antagonist was. If you're in the mood for a scare, look no further. 3. He wasn't especially well-developed, and I resented it a lot when he was turned into just another dopey point of a love triangle, but for the first part of the book... me gusta Sam Lloyd. Mmm mmm. (view spoiler) [Here's my obligatory weigh-in on the love triangle: Sam is the better character, but I don't like him with Evie; they're too similar. Jericho would do nicely to balance her out. I'll keep Sam, thanks very much. (hide spoiler) ] Well, now that I've written a more negative review for this book than any of my friends on here currently have, I'll retreat back to my cave of bitterness and judgment, from which I apparently tear apart the things other people love. Don't let me near your favorite things, guys. ...more The Diviners is my first book by Libba Bray, but I can tell you right now that it won\u2019t be my last.

Fortunately, she left me no choice with The Diviners. New York in the 1920s was impossible to resist. I\u2019ll start with my favorite part \u2013 the setting. Libba Bray did an extraordinary job in taking her readers to New York during the Prohibition era. I could hear the music and the laughter, smell the forbidden alcohol, and it made me want to put on a flapper hat and dance my feet right off. I could spend an eternity reading about the Roaring Twenties, and the ghost of a serial killer only made it that much more interesting. Naughty John, Naughty John, does his work with his apron on. Cuts your throat and takes your bones. Sells \u2018em off for a coupla stones\u2026 Yup, you read that right: there\u2019s a ghost of a vicious serial killer on the loose, and the only ones with any chance of stopping him are an 18-year-old psychic girl and a group of people that share the same dream. Even Evie\u2019s uncle Will, who runs The Museum of American Folklore, Superstition and the Occult, also known as The Museum of the Creepy Crawlies, is powerless against this murderous ghost. And if that isn\u2019t enough to freak you out, there are religious fanatics involved as well, and seriously, nothing is creepier than that. To be quite honest, there were parts of this book that were a bit hard to get through. I\u2019m not a fan of 3rd person, multiple points of view narrative to begin with, and The Diviners offered far too many perspectives for my taste. It\u2019s so hard to connect with the characters that way, and Evie was the only one I really felt close too. To top that off, Evie was a hard character to like. She was occasionally self-centered and a little too care-free. (I\u2019m very organized and responsible and people who just breeze through life tend to annoy me.) But there were times when I felt I truly understood why she behaved in such a way, and I could connect with her regardless of her frustrating actions. The loss of a family hero, Evie\u2019s older brother, damaged her family irreparably, and acting out was her way to cope. But don\u2019t let my ranting or those 600 pages scare you off. The Diviners is a book worth reading, although it will force you to read slowly and carefully \u2013 something I\u2019m not quite used to. Bray\u2019s talent for creating an eerie atmosphere is matched only by her intelligent humor. At times, I had to fight the urge to hide under my bed, only to burst out laughing five minutes later at something witty Evie said. Uncle Will frowned. \u201cDidn\u2019t they teach you how to go about research in that school of yours?\u201d \u201cNo. But I can recite \u2018The Battle Hymn of the Republic\u2019 while making martinis.\u201d \u201cI weep for the future.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s where the martinis come in.\u201d Make no mistake, The Diviners is a demanding book. It requires your full attention, but whatever it takes, it gives back tenfold. If I were you I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to pick it up. As for me, I\u2019ll just sit right here, very patiently and without making a sound, and wait for Libba Bray to finish the sequel.

Libba Bray has an impressive ability to make it as eerie as possible \u2013 from our opening chapter, where we're introduced to something terrible being unleashed, to the chilling points of view of the victims before they're murdered. She presents New York as somewhere dark and dangerous, but also intriguing. Although I've never been a superfan of 1920s America, it was difficult to resist. It was compelling and magical and sinister, with scary things lurking in the shadows. I couldn't help but be drawn to it \u2013 by both the glamour and the grittiness. The Diviners is wonderfully crafted, with incredible detail. We're told so much about the time, the characters, and the mystery. The reader accompanies Evie and friends on their investigation into the gruesome, brutal murders occurring across the city, with links to religion and the occult. If I had any reservations at all, it would be that I'd have preferred the story to be ~200 pages shorter to tighten it up and make it a little more fast-paced, which appeals to me as a slow reader. But this extra time did mean that we got to delve into the characters' complicated pasts. It enabled Libba Bray to bring 1920s New York City to life. The Diviners is a stunning mystery that takes us back to the Roaring Twenties and the supernatural horrors found there. I'm looking forward to meeting new Diviners and a new mystery in Lair of Dreams .

She knew the monsters were real.\u201d The Diviners are sure different from anything I've read before. It's deep and shallow, funny and macabre, light and dark - ingredients that often hard to mix together to get a perfect potion in the end and not blow the whole thing apart. I am utterly and irrevocably charmed by how real the book's world felt, as if I could reach out and be pulled inside of 1926 New York City right in the middle of the whirl of Roaring twentieth - whirlwind of flappers and speakeasies, shopping and Broadway plays and movie palaces; writers, musicians, poets and thinkers changing the world; and dark corners where strange and ominous lurks, biding its time and waiting for young and naive to stumble upon it. Sometimes it felt like this book is too much, bursting at seams and words were trying to crawl their way out of the pages, but it was a good \"too much\" feeling; the feeling where you want to join the uproar and be the peart of madness and endless party that this book is. There's so many things I want to tell about The Diviners , but telling half of them will spoil the fun of reading the actual story, because it's slow-paced and gradual, and secrets do not spill at once: they open up step by step and with every page you want more, more, more... So here's my reasons for recommending The Diviners: \u25c6 The atmosphere. From my introduction above you already got the picture of the crazy-good stuff that is waiting for you in this book. Double it, triple it, and you might get closer to reality of how true and alive the world inside the book feels. Starting from authentic descriptions of 20s New York and ending with the use of slang fitting the era - it feels so very atmospheric you never want to leave this world again. \u25c6 Small and huge truths and beliefs. It is impossible to write about one of the biggest centers of the world and do not touch the topics concerning people inhabiting that place. New York was and is a place of many beliefs. Libba Bray did an astonishing job describing what drove New York back in 20s, what issues dominated society and how it reflected the lives of New Yorkers : religion, xenophobia, sexuality, Ku Klux Klan, World War I, conflict of fathers and children - you name anything and it almost surely was in the book, and not just in any superficial way: the author took great pains in making every topic matter. \u201cThere is a dualism inherent in democracy--opposing forces pushing against each other, always. Culture clashes. Different belief systems. All coming together to create this country. But this balance takes a great deal of energy.\u201d \u25c6 Diverse set of characters. Everyone of them contributes a great deal to the story through prism of their beliefs and view on the world. You will not meet two similar characters in this book: everyone of them is unique in their own way . The summary makes us think that Evie O\u2019Neill is the MC or the main-est of them all. But she is not. Sure, her voice dominates the story, but her point of view is as important as of any other character. I liked that they all felt real and flawed; not your prefect typical teenagers descended from the pages of another YA story, I wouldn't even call this story YA if not for the characters' age. I don't want to divulge deeper into the characters' backgrounds, because I think it's better if you'll meet them in person and they'll spill their secrets and dreams to you. \u201cThere is no greater power on this earth than story.\u201d \u25c6 Supernatural element. I am partial to horror movies and enjoy watching one from time to time, but never ever had I read such creepy I-sleep-with-lights-turned on-level story . I kid you not, if anyone gave me warning before I started reading it, I'd probably think twice before starting. The closest thing to describe the creepiness that comes to my mind is Freddy Krueger movies, but I would risk by going further and saying that Naughty John is way creepier than ol' boy Freddy. \u201cNaughty John, Naughty John, does his work with his apron on. Cuts your throat and takes your bones, sells 'em off for a coupla stones.\u201d I could hear him whistling that song while he stalks his victims, luring them into dark alleys or half-crumbled old mansions *shudders* Just imagine: You are walking home late in the evening and hearing someone's steps behind you. You turn around, but there's no one. You continue walking and now you hear the steps again only this time joined by creepy whistling. You turn around again and again there's no one. You continue your walk but now your pacing is way more urgent as if you want to reach the light of the nearest street lamp as soon as possible... and then BOOM!! there's someone standing right in front of you, as if they appeared out of thin air. Now, if such kind of thing does not scare you, then you can bravely read the book, but if you are scared out of your pants, then maybe you should think twice before you read this book. Just a friendly warning *goes to check under her bed*. \u25c6 Two words: Sam Lloyd . That fella got my nickers on fire, I tell ya! There was not enough of him in the book (so not enough), but little thief managed to steal my heart anyway. \u201cDo you think you can manage to not steal anything while I\u2019m gone?\u201d \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m trying to steal is your heart, doll.\u201d Sam smirked. \u201cYou\u2019re not that talented a thief, Sam Lloyd.\u201d I dare to protest, because he is that talented a thief! Things that spoiled the fun for me: \u25c6 The love-triangle . Agh, I hoped so much there wouldn't be one, but, alas, my prayers went unheard. What bothers we is not the presence of love-triangle per se, but how it was displayed in the story. To say it jumped down from the ceiling like a nasty bug and spoiled the fun, would be a pretty accurate simile, because if from one involved side of the said triangle I expected feelings and therefore was ready for that side to suffer because of unrequited love, never did I imagine the other side would reciprocate the feelings: one minute she felt friendly toward the guy, the next minute she's dreaming of his abs and kisses, and sure it is not Sam Lloyd she's dreaming about kissing! Meh, I am utterly against such violation of my OTP. It sure gave me lots of the heebie-jeebies ! And it's not only about my preferences, I tell you, the girl did not have romantic feelings toward the said abs (he's dull, really) until the author decided she, in fact, did. I told ya, like a bug from the ceiling indeed. What worsens the situation is that the love-struck girl's best friend is goofy for the abs. Now, it feels like a dirty business to make out with your best-friend's dream boy. Aren't there's a girl code or something against such actions? \u25c6 Too many POVs. I can't argue that multi POV strategy widens the picture and creates a bigger window for us to observe the events and enjoy New York city from all sides and perspectives. But there's something tedious about reading from so many strangers' points of view, especially when you get attached to MCs but understand there's not enough of them, because newbies usurped their space. Plus, I am really the type of person who prefers less POVs=more character development left for MCs. \u25c6 Too many pages . It's not a huge issue, but I wished there was slightly less pages of descriptions and stuff? Again, it's my personal preferences, because long descriptions of nature, house, people and especially pavements, do not hold my attention and I loose the narrative thread and then have to come back and reread some passages, because I drifted too far and lost the moment where dialogues started. The verdict: I guess 5 against 3 means that I really enjoyed the book and looking forward to continue my acquaintance with this series and Sam Lloyd . I lowered my rating to 3.5 stars, because the love-triangle was a serious killjoy for me, and, trust me, I rarely severe the rating only because of the love-triangle, but in this case I did because that bad it was for me. I pos-i-tute-ly recommend this book for reading , so, shoo, go dive into the world of The Diviners and New York of Roaring twenties. ...more Full Review This is not the type of book you fly through, and with almost 600 pages it's a far cry from a quick read.

The roaring 20's are a fascinating time, with the glitzy and glam and flapper culture, it's always been an interesting era for a story to take place in. I don't usually read historical fiction, not for any particular reason, I just haven't. It seems fitting that the first historical fiction that I read in a don't know how long should be one taking place in such a captivating era. Like I was saying, this a book you take your time with and savor. Bray put countless details in this book, the time and research she put in is evident through the slang, references to current events at the time, even to ads, brands, and slogans mentioned. There's so much depth here, I really felt like I was living the life of this flapper from the 20's. Even though Bray does an amazing job of giving context clues, when I first started The Diviners, I looked up a list of slang used in the 20's (can you believe how many variations of *animal*'s *unlikely physical attribute* there were back then: cat's pajamas, bee's knees, monkey's eyebrows). I really loved all the slang, the way the characters spoke just sounded so authentic and charming. This book was chock full of mystery and intrigue and heebie jeebies. The spook factor in this book is cranked up pretty high, and there's plenty of scenes that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up a bit. This is the type of books were the questions lead to even more questions, and you're left guessing the whole way: who's Naughty John? What's going one? What's that character's story? What does this have to do with that? And naturally, you approach the ending, and everything starts to look like it's going to be tied altogether with a nice little bow, then BAM! More unexplained things, more questions. We have an amazing cast of characters here, all with intricate and mysterious backgrounds. I loved seeing how they all sort of started to connect together, and I have a feeling we are only seeing the beginning of how they are all involved in the happens of the story. I don't think there was a single character I didn't like, some surprised me, some I figured out from the start, some only had a fleeting role, but all of them felt real and unique to me. With so much going on, and so many characters, the individuality of the characters really kept this book from becoming confusing and overwhelming. I've never read a Libba Bray book before, and now I'm trying to figure out why the heck not. Although, I'm sort of glad that I waited so long to pick this one up, because I can't imagine having the wait 3 years for the next installment. ...more The Diviners is, without a doubt, my favorite Libba Bray novel - and I've read all of them except for The Beauty Queens which I didn't get time to finish but which I fully intend to as I loved the few chapters I read of it.

I know her Gemma Doyle Trilogy had its flaws, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and I remember it changed my perspective of literature at that time quite drastically. The Diviners on the other hand, contains no flaws. Well, to be hones The Diviners is, without a doubt, my favorite Libba Bray novel - and I've read all of them except for The Beauty Queens which I didn't get time to finish but which I fully intend to as I loved the few chapters I read of it. I am, truly, a self-proclaimed Libba Bray fan. I know her Gemma Doyle Trilogy had its flaws, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and I remember it changed my perspective of literature at that time quite drastically. The Diviners on the other hand, contains no flaws. Well, to be honest I think this 578 Page book should have been longer, but I'm glad there's a sequel. I don't want to say good-bye to these characters anytime soon. Evie O\u2019Neill is not like other girls living during the booming industrial age of the Roaring 20s. For one, she\u2019s loud, outspoken, and hilariously full of life, but Evie also contains a gift that few other possess \u2013 by merely touching an object, Evie can glean information about its owner while that object was on them. Thus, after a \u201cscandalous\u201d incident forces her to stay with her Uncle Will in New York City, Evie finds herself in the midst of a mystery - a murder mystery no less. While random victims seem to be murdered in a bizarre \u2013 and frankly speaking creepy \u2013 fashion in New York, we are also introduced to a slew of other characters and story lines beyond just than of Evie\u2019s. Jericho, the soft-spoken and handsome young man who works at Uncle Will\u2019s Museum of Creepy Crawlies American Folklore, Superstition, and the Occult; Theta, a beautiful show-star who dreams of making it big; Henry, a piano player with his own slew of secrets; Memphis, a handsome black poet who used to be able to cure with a touch; and many, many more. Nevertheless, even with an enormous cast, Libba Bray\u2019s The Diviners manages to transport you back into America\u2019s Roaring 20s and despite the freaky murders that occur left and right, you won\u2019t want to leave. I\u2019ll be perfectly honest \u2013 I didn\u2019t expect to not love this book. I went into The Diviners with high expectations and I came out of it with my mind blown, itching for the sequel despite the concrete ending and wanting to immediately flip to the beginning and experience this novel all over again. Yes, experience, for what Libba Bray creates is a portal into the realm of the past, full with the blitz, glamour, and utter joy of living in the Roaring 20s. Nevertheless, into this happy-go-lucky setting, she manages to throw in and create one of the most chilling mysteries I\u2019ve ever read. It takes a lot to scare me while I read a book, but The Diviners sent my spine tingling with chills and had me constantly jumping in the middle of the street whenever I heard a whistle. It\u2019s one of those books that assimilate itself into your life because you simply cannot let go of its pure awesomeness. While the setting and fanatic murders of The Diviners itself make this novel stand out, what truly makes it a remarkable story is its characters. Evie is a gal that I just love. Not only is she fiercely headstrong, independent, and full of spunk, but she has her own share of flaws and can even be hard to like at times, but all this only serves to make her more real, more three-dimensional, and more understanding in my eyes. If I had to pick a book best friend, I\u2019d pick Evie because believe me, this is a girl you want by your side. While Evie startles us with her outgoing nature though, it is Naughty John, the ghost killer in this novel, who truly takes our breath away \u2013 not with his dashing good looks, but with his tantalizing murder song, tell-tale whistle, and utter creep factor. The Diviners is probably one of the few books I\u2019ve read where the reader knows the killer from the beginning and is still utterly invested in the story. It seems as if it\u2019s a storyline that is doomed to fail, but really, the reader is only kept frantically flipping the pages to see how Evie manages to use her power and sharp wit to uncover that this murderer isn\u2019t even alive, but a ghost. It\u2019s a wonderfully spun tale and the cast of other characters who accompany her on this mission are just as heart-warming, well-developed, and deep as Evie is. One of the most memorable side characters, who really is a main character on his own, is Memphis. While Memphis\u2019 and Evie\u2019s storylines don\u2019t intermingle as much as we might like in this installment, his storyline perfectly sets us up for the direction this trilogy is taking. You see, Memphis is a young black man struggling to cope with the loss of his gift of healing \u2013 a gift which failed him when he most needed it to cure his mother. Thus, we are introduced to a second storyline in this tale, one of the diviners, a group of people who possess gifts, much like Memphis and Evie. In most cases, multiple storylines, narrators, and characters in general is a recipe for disaster, but yet again, Libba Bray pulls it off perfectly. Naughty John and his murders still remain to be our prime issue at hand, but the subtle manner in which Bray wove together the back stories of her characters and revealed to us the wondrous direction in which her trilogy was heading was all done with a talent that I must admit is unparalleled. I could go on about The Diviners for hours if I really wanted, but I\u2019ll let you discover the magic that this book contains for yourself. The Diviners is unlike anything you\u2019ve ever read before. It\u2019s original. It\u2019s atmospheric. It's vivid and sparkling and jumps out from the pages. Its characters are thoughtful, deep, and full of their own human flaws. Its murder mystery is chilling and creepy. Its setting is beautiful beyond doubt. Its multiple perspectives are written flawlessly. Its plot is only thickening in this book and I can't wait to see where it goes. It is scary. It is funny. It is love.

When a body, branded with a cryptic symbol is found her Uncle, who has a well informed obsession with the occult, is called in and Evie tags along. But Evie has secrets of her own, special powers that allow her to divine certain things about people. She is also a party girl in a city teeming with life; other stories unfold, other secrets emerge. Oh and something dark and evil has awakened, armed with a sinister agenda. Naughty John has come home, whistling his own little ditty. Most of the main characters in this story are about the same age as Evie but have a history, feelings that bely their young age. Something doesn\u2019t fit. Memphis, a poetry writing, numbers runner, was the only character that bled through the pages to reach me; I thought he was wonderful, touched by a thoughtful pen. The rest are cardboard cut-outs, restored images of a time and place. Bray does an excellent job in painting atmospheric scenes, both shiny and grim. There just images though, ideas pulled wet from a well, then groomed and channelled to promise future tales, pushed together, edges furled, some left flapping; bound by the thin thread of a story. For me there was no harmony, not as though Bray hit the wrong notes exactly, more like she never quite found the right ones. It felt more assembled than written, nothing flowed or coalesced and in the end I felt removed and yes, manipulated. Perhaps most unsettling of all, my daughter absolutely loved this book. Over time and after many a shared stroll through many a page, bound and moved by a myriad of words, I have come to trust and respect her opinion. And while our interests may take us in different directions, more often then not, when we meet, we agree. We may not be completely in sync, but we are at least in the same ball park. Not here.

I've had this book on the stack for a while, and I didn't know anything about it, except the blurb on the back reminded me of one of my favorite iOS games: Elder Signs. 20's, occult, NYC etc. I thought the atmosphere was pretty interesting, and the book definitely paid the concept off! Basically it's about a secret society of people emerging with powers in 1920's New York City, to fight a looming bad guy (who will show up in a sequel down the road.) The cast of characters was pretty good, all flawed and interesting backgrounds, and the overall murder plot was gripping and had twists and turns enough to keep me interested. The main storyline was resolved really well, and there's a setup (albeit a bit TOO involved at the end) for the next one that definitely made me want to keep reading! I guess my only wish is that the book had been NOT Young Adult. I didn't really get that when I went into it, and even though the lead girl was 17, I honestly feel like the book would have been a bit more effective had she just aged it up and made it more complex and grittier. But partially that could be my bias against YA novels in general, they always feel just a TOUCH hollow to me, like there's something there to be mined they can't because of an age restriction. Regardless, I really enjoyed it and recommend the book for something fresh and fun and different! ...more *cue eerie music* At a birthday party in New York in the 1920's, a bunch of teenagers decide to play with a Ouija board.

I'm one chapter in and already I know this book is not going to be my cuppa tea: Horror is just not my thing, and evil supernatural kinds of horror are really not my thing. Then in the second chapter we meet our main character, Evie, and she's an insolent 17 year old who likes to party hard and drink too much gin, and thinks she's smarter than everyone else around her, including her parents. She also uses way too much 1920's slang, which, maybe it was realistic? but it just struck me as a little too try-hard on the author's part. Evie very quickly took whatever lingering interest I still had in this novel and stomped it dead. Luckily (not for me, but for New York City) Evie and some other people are Diviners, with their own supernatural powers that can combat the evil ones. So there are gruesome murders by the evil spirit (who becomes more tangible with each killing), and investigations and quests to stop the evil spirit--sort of like Ghostbusters , except, you know, without the cool ghost-catching technology or anyone with anything remotely approaching a sense of humor--and also a little romance, just because. So. I think this might be a great read for some people. Unfortunately it pushed all the wrong buttons for me, sort of the opposite of A Town Like Alice . I'll still take a look at the sequel so I can report back to NetGalley. :p *insert rude noises* But unless the plot takes a very different direction in book 2, I'll be outta there pretty quickly. Prior post: Ugh. I grabbed the sequel to this on NetGalley last week and then picked this first book up at the library. I'm about 50 pages in and I don't care for the main character--a 17 year old girl who like to drink and party and has special powerz--or the whole \"evil spirit escapes from a Ouija board and is clearly going to cause massive amounts of trouble\" plot. What to do? I hate to give up on a NetGalley book unread, but I don't want to wade through 575 pages of this book to get there. Update: So I thought I'd breeze through a hundred pages a day, doing a little skimming here and there. But I got to the hundred page mark and thought, screw it, I'm getting through this one tonight. And I did, admittedly with an awful lot of skimming, but I read enough that I feel justified in giving it a rating. ...more 4.5 stars Phew. Finishing this book feels like an achievement.

Historical novels not being my thing, I was a bit concerned that I was getting into a monster of a book that would bore me to death. I had nothing to worry about, however, when only with a few mere pages, Libba had created an intensely creepy and atmospheric setting that promised to disturb, to captivate, and to enchant me for pages and pages and pages and pages to come. This book is creepy to the nth degree. It sent chills up my spine and kept them there from start to finish. The setting being the main reason for the perpetual eerie feeling. The fact that it's a historical is actually what I ended up enjoying the most about the setting, which really surprises me. Dealing with an age old serial killer and an ancient sinister mansion that becomes a character in and of itself, the fact that the book is set in an age where religion is rampant, and technology is, well\u2026 not, makes it all the more poignant. Cults, rituals, demonic presences, it's simply not something we hear much about in modern times, yet it's so much more eerie; so much more disturbing than any horror movie with flashy effects we have nowadays. I guess haunted houses were scarier when you couldn't Facebook about it. Libba's immaculate writing style also plays a big hand in the exquisite atmosphere this novel dishes out. Everything is tremendously vivid; I could feel the wind passing through to settle in this creaky house, I could picture New York City in all its 1920s glory - the theatre, the speakeasies, everything -, I was taken by the fabulously old school language to a time before I was even put on this earth, yet it was as if I had been there. Then, we weave in a cast of characters that is so full of life with spunk and energy. Really, it's a work of art! Witty, snarky, and pos-i-tute-ly charming, Evie is a wonderful protagonist; a perfection for this type of novel. The book is clearly very long. It's filled with literary and cultural references, and can be slow paced at first while it begins to carefully weave in infinite substance until it's exploding with facts, details, and fascinating story lines. It can be hard to take all of this in, especially if you're not big on historicals like myself - I did have to take a break for a couple of days to read something a little bit more easier on the intellect - but when you mix in Evie's large personality, you won't be able to get enough of her! She lightens up the air perfectly. We get a dash of humor, some amusing banter, and a personality that makes her thoroughly loveable. She softens this sometimes weighty novel quite marvelously. After not being a fan of her Gemma Doyle series when I tried to read it years ago, I am happy that I was not disappointed with this one. In fact, it quite exceeded my personal expectations of it. I think those with a passion for historical mysteries and paranormal horrors will definitely be thrilled to find everything they're looking for, and more, inside The Diviners. -- An advance copy was provided by the publisher for review.
