If you get a chance to read New Zigon - <+++>The Founder's Curse</+++>, (and I hope you do) then you can tell me if I've missed the mark on any of these objectives. BELIEVABLE SCIENCE FICTION - It is important to me to be able to defend the science mythos introduced. New Zigon's science stems from a combination of the force from Star Wars (huge fan here) and the modern day \"God particle\" theory. The underlying concept is that there is a thing/element that fills the in-between spaces called the \u201cPleovis.\u201d In Latin that loosely translates to \u201cfilling power.\u201d It is fluid,<---M> constantly moving</---M>, making various patterns in nature. If you can learn a pattern and push that pattern on the Pleovis, you can change the world around you. INTERESTING CHARACTERS - I created my characters first and then came up with situations to challenge them. My favorite character to write was Mrs. McNeally, the widow a few farm houses down the road from the main character, John. She has a huge heart with a big old soft spot for John, but she can be eccentric, and she loves to play to human nature to get her way. She can manage John\u2019s father like a master violinist, which is a good thing, or John would never get out from under his chores to go on their adventures! \"CLEAN\" CONTENT - I want a twelve year old to be able to read my story without having his/her parents go into cardiac arrest. APPROPRIATE FOR BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS - My book is from a fourteen-year-old boy's POV. He is a Pennsylvania farm boy who goes to church and is riding the line between thinking girls are weird and noticing they can be pretty. This makes for some interesting internal struggles that boys should be able to relate to without getting embarrassed and that will make girls sigh knowingly. GOOD READ FOR ADULTS \u2013 I am an avid reader, and most of my favorite books are young adult novels. I aimed for a balance between action and discovery/science reveals, with a sprinkle of humor and foreshadowing. The majority of my \u201ctest market\u201d fell in the adult demographic, and all thoroughly enjoyed the book. Were they biased? Possibly\u2026 you will have to decide for yourself! ...more I definitely recommend this book! Both my 12 year old son and I read it and we both found it to be an enjoyable and compelling story.<---F> I really liked the characters (Mrs</---F>. McNeally was my favorite). The adventure and sci-fi are interesting and I found myself wrapped up in the story. The book was \"clean\" in that the worst words used were \"crap\" (as in \"oh crap\", used twice) and \"bastards\" (used once: \"They're bastards, all of them.\") The themes were conservative, meaning controversial topics were n I definitely recommend this book! Both my 12 year old son and I read it and we both found it to be an enjoyable and compelling story. I really liked the characters (Mrs. McNeally was my favorite). The adventure and sci-fi are interesting and I found myself wrapped up in the story. The book was \"clean\" in that the worst words used were \"crap\" (as in \"oh crap\", used twice) and \"bastards\" (used once: \"They're bastards, all of them.\") The themes were conservative, meaning controversial topics were not referenced. It is a \"safe\" read for younger, sensitive readers (like my son), and the strong characters and storyline make it an excellent books for adults. I have difficulty finding books for my son that I enjoy as well, and this one is now at the top of my list! I can't wait for book #2!! ...more I though this book was great! very creative with scientific details on the powers the kids had. also being from Pittsburgh it was neat reading a story that takes place where I am from! I really enjoyed this book. I am a fan of sci-fi and I know from experience that finding good sci-fi for younger readers is not easy. Also happy to know more is to come. A wonderfully well written book that is great for all ages to read. I enjoyed reading all about John Brown this had my wondering a bit but i loved reading it. A must read for book lovers everywhere.<---A>Danelle O'Donnell</---A><---C>Danelle O'Donnell</---C>", "Title": "The Founder's Curse"},
