There's a lot to like about Rossi's futuristic science-fiction novel. The world building is fascinating and vivid, yet simplistic enough for most audiences to grasp reasonably well. The writing is fair enough and I felt that it was reasonably tight and serviceable. It wasn't a perfect novel but I feel that it achieved what it was meant to and that was inspiring me to invest in Aria and Perry's story. Mostly I'm just impressed with Rossi because she clearly is a badass. I can just imagine how her meeting with the editor went: \"Ms. Rossi, thank you for coming. We love your first copy but we're concerned about this Aether thing. What is it? Where did it come from? How does it work?\" Rossi sits back in her chair and kicks her feet up onto the editor's table. She pulls out a raw falcon egg and starts eating it. \"So?\" she asks between bites. \"Well, you never clarify how it works? Why it's there? How did it come to be there?\" Rossi shrugs casually. \"Meh. I don't give a shit. It's there. YA takes it for granted that a 108 year old vampire would fall in love with a teenager. They'll figure out this Aether shit. They have google.\" \"But-\" the editor tries to continue. Rossi pins the editor with a withering gaze. \"I could devote ten boring pages to giving some lameass sciency explanation of the Aether or I could add in 20% more awesome. Also, I know how to falcon punch. I learned it from the mother of this egg I stole before I gave a right hook and uppercut to a shark.\" The editor decides that surrender is the better part of valor and everyone learns an important lesson that day. Especially the wild life. The End. So basically, I like this book, and even if Rossi does eat raw falcon eggs, I like her characters and I like her style. And hopefully you will too. If you know what's good for you. This review also appears on my blog, Cuddlebuggery Book Blog . ...more 2.5 stars My feelings on <+++>Under the Never Sky</+++> are fair to middling.

My partner also bailed about halfway through our readalong, if that counts for anything. Here's what I liked about the book: --The overall concept --Occasional humor in the writing --Interesting shorthand for words, which makes sense in a futuristic society: \"champ,\" \"rancy,\" \"wrathy\" are all great examples of the way language might evolve or devolve, depending on how you look at it --cool \"Smarteye\" technology --a couple of interesting action sequences (<---B>view spoiler</---B>) [including a decapitation! (hide spoiler) ] Here's what I didn't care for: --The girl is much too trusting and had to be rescued over and over, to the point that you want to scream at her. She also isn't all that compelling of a protagonist, and is also occasionally very rude and rather ungrateful. --The names. Aria (GUESS WHAT SHE DOES), Paisley, Lumina, Aria, Echo, Peregrine (view spoiler) [I'm rather ashamed to say that I was glad when Paisley bit it, because I was so happy I didn't have to read her name anymore. (hide spoiler) ] --Interchangeable secondary characters --Weird things that are mentioned in passing but never really explained. Soren's underwater birthday party, no stains, not getting hurt in the Realms' virtual reality type situation, blood lords, the Tides' superhuman senses, etc. --Rather uninspired \"she did this, he did that\" type of writing. Everything is explained as an afterthought and random snippets suddenly dropped, there\u2019s no gradual lead in for it in the narrative. --Some writing choices that didn't quite work as well as the examples in the \"like\" section, such as \"\u201csweaty seaweed\" or \u201chis nephew\u2019s temper had grown dark and damp.\u201d Those just don't make sense to me. There were also some awkward sentences, such as \"Perry woke sweated to his clothes.\" --What is with all the birdish names? Peregrine, Talon, Lumina (which is a type of falcon), etc? I came away from Under the Never Sky feeling rather aggressively indifferent to it. There were moments when the book was fairly entertaining and there were moments when I was extremely bored, so it worked out to be a pretty uneven reading experience. My partner and I really spent most of the time during the two weeks of our readalong asking questions, however. \"What the HELL is aether? How is he doing this? I don't get it!\" and so on and so forth, because so many things were introduced and then dropped and never explained. And even if we got answers, they didn't really provide lightbulb moments so much as a grudging concession that an attempt was made to explain something. Overall, this book felt similar to me to Blood Red Road , Divergent , and Legend , in that they are all very much action-oriented stories. But the difference is, those books had much stronger and more memorable characters, who took initiative and made things happen. Those novels were also, for all their admitted flaws, just plain fun . For me, that element was sorely lacking in this story and I was disappointed to find that I wasn't nearly as excited about this book as many of my friends have been--and that's saying something for a book where there are cannibals. But look! I snapped this Under the Never Sky moment at the beach in January. I do like the title quite a bit, even if I still have no idea what it means. Random Side Notes: There is NO WAY that what Perry thinks smells like violets actually smells like violets, no matter how advanced our society becomes. Also, I wish my skin were as velvety as a mushroom. An advance copy was provided by the publisher for this review.

They are well written and entertaining, with characters and relationships that do not annoy and make you roll your eyes. The summary of Under the Never Sky does this book a disservice. It is accurate enough, but overwhelms you with weird names of things and places. I'll try to explain the plot in a, hopefully, simpler way. In a distant future, our (I assume) planet is ravaged by strange climate changes that make living on the surface quite rough. A big part of the population now exists inside huge, self-supporting, sealed from the outside domes. This group of people finds its only relief from the tediousness of the confined, sterilized living in virtual realities. The other half of the population barely survives outside. Food is scarce, climate dangerous, the living is primal, only the fittest survives. Aria belongs to the sheltered kind, Perry - to the savage kind. When Aria is expelled from the security of her dome, she joins Perry, and together they ally to reach their separate goals. While Under the Never Sky is hardly super-original, whatever genre tropes are used in it, are done exactly to my taste. The novel has dual narration, but the choices <---A>Veronica Rossi</---A> made here work just right. 3rd person helps her avoid the customary similarities between her characters' voices. The switches between the POVs always happen when it is the most advantageous, no repetitiveness, no excessive navel-gazing (also, very frequent whenever 2-POV structure is used). Another plus, Under the Never Sky is more of an adventure story, rather than romance (thank you, Jesus! I mean, Harper Teen). The love story line is strong, but the romance is slow-burning, not angsty, not overwhelming. The priorities are straight here - there are more important things in the characters' lives than a few days-long romantic relationships, things like families and loyalties. Finally, the characters. I really liked Aria and Perry, especially Perry. There is a soft spot in my heart for a guy who is understanding of and helpful during the special lady days (aka periods). Basically, Under the Never Sky , in my eyes, is a perfect mix of adventure and love, sci-fi and romance, entertainment and heartbreak. I am definitely coming back for more. ...more Well, this sure isn\u2019t your usual dystopian read. It was quite captivating, but not actually perfect.

To be honest, there is a lot lot lot of angst in this since around 75% of the story is based on them getting to know each other and most importantly trust one another. Needless to say, when the real thing finally happened (the romance) it was as amazing as fireworks. And, of course, worth the wait. I didn\u2019t truly cared for the plot as much as I wished to. At first, indeed, but, then, it didn\u2019t feel like a lot was happening, until a certain percentage. Aria was looking for her mom and coincidence is she encounters Perry (again) whom is looking for his little Nephew, Talon. In a way, it is true: \u2018Destiny brought them together.\u2019 And I\u2019m glad it did because they are simply perfect for each other! The world-building was a little confusing. There were some words related to it that I didn\u2019t always knew the meaning to or what type of people it represented because, let\u2019s not forget, it is a dystopian so the society is divided indeed in spaces with different habitants. It is a doom with that contains multiple doors. It did remind me of Blood Red Road (due to the main plot), however, not throughout my read. Only during some of the scenes but it is not a rip-off of it at all, so no worries. What I loved the most about it were the characters. They were gorgeously developed and I grew to like every one of them, even the most despicable ones. And what is great is that there are many but you will know who they separately are. No confusion. The writing was good, but not quite impressive. There was so much of (he/she) \u2018said\u2019 in dialogs and I, sometimes, was annoyed of them, since it wouldn\u2019t have been that hard to choose some synonyms, I believe. Nonetheless, it was a pleasant writing still. An atmosphere was always present and that helped to make the holes in the plot less evident, in a certain way. What I mean is that, there may not have been a grand quantity of events in it, but I still wasn\u2019t what we can call \u2018bored.\u2019 I anyways wanted to know what would happen next because that\u2019s just how connected to the characters I was and I\u2019m pretty sure the lively (yet sometimes very poignant) ambience had to do with it as well. Overall, this was a book I enjoyed reading. As said, not flawless but still worth it and recommended. You simply have to meet the wonderful couple that is - becomes - Aria & Perry. Enjoy!

And if I'm really being honest here, I feel a little conned by this being marketed as dystopian. Sci-Fi, yes. Dystopian, no. Maybe post-apocalyptic, but even that is pushing it. Recently, another GoodReads reviewer Marg reviewed this book and her feelings regarding it's placement in the dystopian genre mirror my own. Aria lives in a world where her people live in pods and fear the outside world dubbed The Death Shop due to the cannibals and Aether storms that wreak havoc on the land. Her people spend almost all of their time in virtual reality Realms rarely attempting to live in the Real. One day Aria is exiled from her pod city, Reverie, and embarks on a journey with an outsider named Perry to find her way back into her society. The premise of Under the Never Sky vaguely reminds me of The Reality Bug because it has the same general idea of people in the future too busy in their virtual reality worlds to come outside and play. So, I was excited to read Under the Never Sky because the possibilities with it are endless and I applaud Rossi for going outside the YA \"box\" and doing something different. Unfortunately, I don't think that potential was really tapped into in this book. But I'm getting ahead of myself. What I really want to talk about is what I did like first. I did like the characters. In fact, I liked them all except for Aria. I think Perry was well-developed and I felt I could easily sympathize with his situation throughout the novel. Roar, a good friend of Perry's that we meet halfway through the book, was awesome. I loved his humor and I always felt like I enjoyed the scenes best that involved him. Aria fell short for me. I understand she was going through a lot in the story, but I never really felt connected to her. Though, admittingly, this could have to do with the fact that I'm not a fan of third person PoV narratives. Still, I found Aria rather annoying in the beginning. For example, there is one scene in the novel where she and Perry are stopping to rest in a cave and Perry tells her to stay in the cave so he can hunt. Now, Aria has zero survival skills because she has never needed them ever, but what does she do? She wanders on her own in search of berries. Did she stop to think they could be poisonous? NO. How about a wild animal mauling her to death? NO. Or maybe even getting lost? NO. As a result of her little adventure, she ends up getting her and Perry in a serious bind. So, along with survival skills, people living in pods also do not possess common sense either. *sigh* Thankfully, there *is* character growth for her and she did grow on me by the end of the book. I wouldn't call us BFFs, but I no longer had the urge to fling my Kindle across the room. I also enjoyed how Rossi played with the Outsiders having heightened senses. Perry, in particular, has a heightened sense of smell enabling him to smell emotions. That was pretty cool, but there were a few awkward parts with regards to this special skill. Like, say, knowing when your female companion is on her period. Yikes! Talk about uncomfortable. Other than that, there were times when it felt like he was one *sniff* away from becoming man's best friend. *sniff* Just throw him the damn ball, Aria! Whose a good boy, Perry? You are! That is pretty much where the \"likes\" end for me friends. So, let's cut to the chase and get down to it. Two words: World Building. If you are reading a dystopian novel there are a few things that are kinda, sorta important. We need to know what stuff is, how it works, why the world has come to be where it is, information about how the society is run, ect. You know, basic dystopian elements. That is where this book lacks the most. The reader is flung into the story, head first, without any background information. We don't know what caused Aria's society to live in pods. We know nothing about her society except that they have these realms. We know nothing about the Aether or the Unity. This is the most background information we are given: The Aether didn\u2019t look like something that could put an end to the world, yet that had nearly happened during the Unity. And speaking of the Aether, that angered me the most. It is talked about ALL THE TIME, but it is NEVER EXPLAINED. What is an Aether storm? I don't know and neither will you. Unless, of course, you are a mind reader. If you are, please share the secrets of this universe with me! There were so many holes in the story that I just could.not.compute . Throwing around capitalized words does not impress me. The writing style was another issue for me. I had a lot of trouble getting into the beginning. In fact, I almost wanted to give up, but I was told to stick with it because \"the beginning is rough, but it's worth it in the end.\" Hmm...Ok, yeah. I didn't see it that way. I'd say a little more than the first half is very rough. I found it difficult to keep up with what was going one because not a lot of time is used to describe what was happening. One minute the characters are having a conversation and the next sentence they are walking in the forest. This book could have used better transitioning. It didn't feel \"smooth\" to me. However, my fellow readers are right. The book is noticeably better during the last half. If only the first half could get it's act together! All in all, again, this isn't a bad book, but clearly holds the markings of newbie mistakes. I will most likely check out the sequel because I like where Rossi is going with things and who knows? Maybe she will surprise me. ARC was provided by the publisher via NetGalley.

I realized that I just wanted to talk about the damn book without being sarcastic or witty for a change. Yes, I had this entire scene playing out in my head because of that damn soap opera book cover (which, btw, is actually a cool looking cover). Surprisingly enough, just about every single thing which would normally make me rant, jeer and shake my head was present in this book. There was serious pining, prose bordering on purple, crazy names, more romance than needed for sci-fi, a few hazy world building details, etc. etc. Yet, I found that this author had the talent to pull it all off in such a way that I didn't mind hearing 20 times how Aria had the scent of violets (imagine that!). Ms. Rossi has got the flair. Not the \"spirit fingers\" type of flair, but she has that certain \"something\" when it comes to her writing which makes me want to be dropped down into the middle of this crappy dystopic world and spend time with Aria, Perry and Roar - simply because I want to be in the presence of such dynamic personalities. The writing style was third person rotating PoV's. Now that's something you don't see every day. Usually, third person flows in and out among the characters without hard edged distinctions. In this tale, the main characters got separate chapters, yet the perspective stayed focused on the atmosphere around the characters instead of a first person account. I was surprised at how much I FELT , given the writing style. I could relate to what Aria and Perry were thinking and feeling, even without the use of \"I\" in the story. My stomach was doing flip-flops at certain crucial points in the book. In a good way! The world was complex, yet still had a few gaps that needed to be filled in. Hopefully, we'll get more answers in the next couple of books about the world structure and genetic twists (this science almost feels like magic). Truth be told, it took me over a week to get through the first 25% of the book. The first few chapters were pretty darn confusing. The slow start is the one and ONLY reason why I had to stick with 4.5 stars because the second half of the book was 5 stars all the way. Once I met Perry and started to see who he was as a person, I found myself falling hard and fast. Even though most of my review will focus on the characters and feelings, I should add that there was a healthy does of adventure, survival, world politics, techie stuff (virtual reality), etc. in this book. It wasn't all swoony fluff. This is probably a girlier form of sci-fi. Normally, I prefer to keep my romance isolated to other genres because I want to see more of the techie side of sci-fi. With this book, the romance was the draw. And this time, was I not only okay with it, but I was completely absorbed in it. A story like Aria and Perry's is rare. I devoured every moment of their interaction because it was absolutely beautiful. While I am happy that the world and story was interesting and engaging, I will let you read someone else's review if you want a book summary. The racial/genetic talents were exciting to read about and I liked how the characters started out as enemies before finding solace in one another. It amused me to no end that Perry's first impression of Aria was that she (literally) stunk because of where she'd come from. We'll be here all night if I tell you everything I liked about the story, so I'm going to end this review with the main reason why I will be gushing about this book : the characters. Peregrine (Perry) - I have kids who have watched Phineas and Ferb , so it was hard not to think of Perry the Platypus when seeing the name Perry. This character has to be one of my new favorite male characters. He's tough, protective, and strong...yet still managed to be one of the nicest guys I'd seen after we got past his standoffish exterior. I adore characters with multiple layers. His hair looked like it had never seen a brush. Snarled blonde ropes, all uneven in length and color, coiling in every direction. As he'd spoken, she could've sworn she'd glimpsed canines that were slightly too long and canine . But nothing was more hideous than his eyes. The Savage's eyes were bright green but also reflective, like the eerie gaze of a nocturnal animal. He didn't have a clue what book he'd chosen. He couldn't read. Had never learned. He walked out of the cave before she could see that and call him a stupid Savage. He smiled. It was the lion grin she'd only seen a few times. Sweet and engaging, with a hint of shyness. It showed a whole part of him she didn't know. Peregrine or Perry? She didn't know what to call him. Perry made her shoes from book covers and taught her how to find berries. Peregrine had tattoos and flashing green eyes. He twirled a knife without fear of cutting himself and put arrows through people's necks. Aria - She's got some attitude, but still falls into a very acceptable version of normal. She isn't badass for no apparent reason, nor is she a complete dumb girl who needs to be rescued non-stop. And at least the reason for her being named Aria made more sense than what I've seen in other stories (America Singer comes to mind). Roar - I want me a Roar. I'm kicking myself now for not reading his prequel with Liv first. This will have to be fixed asap because I loved Roar almost as much as Perry. His playful and good-natured cockiness balanced Perry's serious nature perfectly. Up close, she saw the gleam in Roar's gaze. He had a prince's looks but a pirate's eyes. \"Seers are good at looking, and good-looking, but before you start wondering, no, I'm not a Seer. Just lucky.\" Sigh. I have nothing else to say. I will be having a serious book fantasy about these characters and world over the next few days while anxiously awaiting my chance to dig into book 2 of this series. Of warmth and calluses. Soft and hard together. She absorbed the beauty of him and his world. Of every moment over the past days. All of it, filling her up like the first breath she'd ever taken. And never had she loved life more. Oh, and HOLY CRAP to that ending, btw. :p ...more \"A world of nevers under a never sky.\" There's always something so compelling about a book with a tantalizing title.

First things first, this is not strictly a dystopian novel. Nitpicky, I know, but while it is post-apocalyptic fiction, it doesn't fit into my parameters of what a dystopian should be. In fact, this works way, way better as science fantasy than any other genre. Except for some throwaway references to the Earth we know, Rossi has built a full-scaled, beautifully rendered sci-fi/fantasy world that could have been self-contained. Aria is a Dweller, a girl who grew up in virtual Realms her whole life, sheltered by the Pods, living her life through the make-believe worlds she accesses through her Smarteye, the eyepatch that lets her tap into her virtual reality. But her fantasy life takes a 180-degree turn when her mother goes missing and she becomes involved in a crazy escapade in the real world. It is there that she first encounters Peregrine, a Savage from the outside, the world they call The Death Shop, where reality is harsh, disease-ridden and dangerous. When Aria is falsely accused of doing something treasonous and cast out into the Death Shop, she has no-one but her wits and Perry to fall back on. These two complete strangers from opposite worlds enter into an uneasy partnership to rescue the people most beloved to them, finding through their journey that the things they never questioned before need to be examined after all. I loved this book. It was everything I expected Blood Red Road to be, and wasn't. The narrative is told from dual perspectives, so we get a clear picture of both Perry and Aria's lives, their prejudices, their beliefs, their emotions. The lives of this hugely mismatched couple has been so different, they might as well be living on different planets. Rossi does a beautiful job drawing them onto common ground, first through extenuating circumstances and mutual need, and then through a deeper understanding of the other person's perspectives, down to a level of personal growth that eventually makes them respect and understand each other better. The worldbuilding in this book was fascinating, but not entirely clear. There is something called the Unity, and then some sort of devastating apocalypse that drives people underground into the Pods and then seals them into that kind of lifestyle. Apparently, the Pod people (hah!) moved in to escape the storms caused by the Aether, but we are never really told what the Aether is. Also, how did the Outsiders survive this apocalyptic event, if the Dwellers ran away in fear of their lives in the first place? However, these questions are not as annoying as they could be. Rossi manages to give you a feel of the world without dumping all the details. You get the feeling that she's holding off on some good stuff to populate the second book, but not in a mean I-want-to-sell-more-books way, but more in a I-don't-want-to-infodump way. I really liked the way she builds Perry and Aria's characters. Perry, in a shocking turn of events, doesn't immediately appeal to Aria. In fact, she finds him sinister and sort of disturbing, due to his unnaturally long canines. Perry, in turn, finds Aria outright disgusting in the beginning, with her artificial breeding and her aroma of rot. It takes a lot of adjustment for them to begin to even see each other as people, rather than a means to an end. Even when Perry begins to admire her, it's more because of her unflinching courage and goodness than the fact that she starts to smell better. There's a lot happening in this book that I don't want to give away, cumulating in a plot twist that blew my mind, but it never seems too busy, if you know what I mean. Rossi holds the reins of the story expertly right through to the very end, and none of the storylines go galloping away into the mists. You are perfectly aware of what is happening and what is left to happen. This is not a deeply nuanced book, but it's a lot of fun to read. I wavered between four and five stars on this one, but I gave it the five because I enjoyed it so much. It was a quick, fast-paced read that gave me all the right vibes, and I really needed that after the disappointment of Hallowed .

I don't even know why, really. I thought the premise sounded cool. Like, \"Ooh! Firestorms! Cannibals! It sounds so exciting!\" Plus the average rating on Goodreads is pretty high ... although, by now I probably should have learned that the average rating means pretty much nothing. So, I'd like to tell ya what this book is about, but to be honest I'm not sure how to describe it.

So, I'd like to tell ya what this book is about, but to be honest I'm not sure how to describe it. Basically this girl, Aria, is exiled from her dystopian-society-thing and must survive in the wilderness ... where of course she meets a \"sexy boy\" named Perry who can smell people's feelings. (Yeah, we'll get to that later.) There's some vague plot about Aria trying to find her mother, and Perry trying to find his nephew who has been captured. But mostly it's just about the two of them wandering around, not really doing much. Over all, this just gets a big \"meh\" from me. I didn't like much about it, but it wasn't particularly infuriating/annoying either so I'm not giving it one star. It had some minor redeeming qualities, but mostly I just had a lot of issues with it. The world-building This is another one of those YA books that claims to be a \"dystopia,\" yet barely any effort goes into creating the dystopian society. Basically, Aria comes from this place where they all wear these gadgets on their eyeballs called \"Smarteyes\"\u2013\u2013which put them all into an alternate reality thing. Sounds pretty cool and all ... the thing was, this wasn't very clearly established for the first 50 pages or so. For a while I was pretty confused. For example, there was this little sentence on page 7: \"During the last song, the stadium flooded with seawater. Everyone had transformed into mermaids and mermen.\" Before that, I'd already gathered that we were in some kind of futuristic setting, but this still seemed to kind of come out of nowhere. I read the sentence probably three times and I was still, like, \"What?! How'd they do THAT?\" Then outside this society was just ... the rest of the world, pretty much? I didn't really get it. I don't know, woods and caves and stuff. I'm sure I missed some details due to skimming, since I started to get bored after a while. But over all, there didn't seem to be much effort in the world-building department. Often, I didn't really know where the characters were or why they were there. The slang Okay, I understand that in the future, people will probably talk differently and have new words and things like that. And sure, made-up slang can work well in books. For example, I think Scott Westerfeld does a nice job with that kind of stuff in his series\u2013\u2013like in Uglies when they use a few words like \"bubbly\" and \"icy\" and \"happy-making\" or whatever. And at least these were used in a context that made sense and weren't used every other word ... so it wasn't too overbearing or confusing. Then we have some of the dialogue that Veronica Rossi writes: \"Champ, man. It's unreal. I mean, it's real. Zap, you know what I mean.\" And it's like... Umm no, I don't know what you mean ... ? In my opinion, it's hard to connect with characters when they sound that ridiculous. While I basically understand what's being said, it still feels too crammed with slang words. And because of that, it just sounds forced and unbelievable. Not to mention that I really don't think anyone will ever replace curse words with things like \"zap.\" Why would you say that when we already have such amazing swear words? Well anyway, moving on to other issues. Aria Oh hooray, another Mary-Sue protagonist in a YA book. Aria pretty much has no notable flaws at all. She was genetically enhanced so that she would be an amazing singer, and thus can just break out into a heart-wrenching opera song whenever she wants. (Also, her mother chose such a subtle name for her.) She also apparently looks incredibly sexy and smells like flowers even when she goes for days without bathing. Like, really. Perry has a sense of super smell, and you'd think he would be like, \"Whoa, I can smell all the sweat in your armpits and the grime in your hair.\" Instead he's like, \"Ahhh, Aria always smells like a field of daisies!\" Oh, and he also thinks her period smells like \"violets.\" That's right, ladies and gentlemen ... Aria is so wonderful that her period smells like flowers . Perry Perry is not much better as a character. Again, we have a rather big asshole passed off as being a quality boyfriend. Maybe it's just me, but he kind of seemed like a bad rip-off of Jace from The Mortal Instruments. Maybe just because he had curly golden hair and a lot of tattoos ... but, yeah. Except instead of killing demons, he kills innocent people instead! Like, there was this one part where he left Aria alone for a while. She wandered out of the cave they had been hiding in, and started talking to these three random guys that she met. Then, Perry comes back out of nowhere, shoots two of the guys and beheads the third. His argument is, \"THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY CANNIBALS.\" Really, man? Really ? I mean, if they had been covering Aria in steak sauce and dangling her over a fire, then I would have been a bit concerned. But ... she was just talking to them. You could have at least tried to talk to them, dude. Maybe they really were cannibals, but there wasn't very concrete evidence for that ... And uh yeah, he has a super-strong sense of smell, which apparently allows him to smell people's feelings (and to think it smells wonderful when blood gushes out of a vagina). I really don't understand how that works, but okay. Not much to say about that. I just thought it was strange. He also just said some very, unnecessarily rude things to Aria. For example: \"I have killed a woman before. Keep talking. You might be the second.\" OMG I'M JUST FANGIRLING OVER HIM HE'S SO HAWT AND WONDERFUL. But anyway in all seriousness ... I don't really understand what there is to like about this guy. The romance It was just ... forced. It felt like the typical, \"Oh this is a YA book so it needs some ROMANCE.\" But the romance is not thoroughly developed. Perry is an asshole to Aria for a while, then he starts to like her. All of a sudden, he's nice to her and they kiss and stuff! But, there aren't really any steps between those two different stages of their relationship. Also, I think this book wins for \"most awkward sex scene ever.\" I don't have a problem with there being sex in YA books, but I prefer that if it's going to happen, it should be particularly powerful or meaningful in some way. In this book, they just kinda ... did it. For no particular reason. They were like, hiding from wolves, and then suddenly they were having sex. And this was accompanied by a strange conversation that went something like this: Aria: Lawlz, can I get preggers from this? Perry: *sniffs the air* NOPE, I can smell that you are not ovulating so it's all good! Aria: Haha ok. *allows sex* Uhh. What. Mmmm ... the sweet smell of UTERUS ... Well, anyway. I give the book props for a few things. For example, Aria was actually given a weapon and taught a bit about fighting ... so at least she wasn't completely helpless. Also the fact that she got her period in the book is somewhat cool, since authors tend to not bother to talk about that ... although, it's the kind of thing I don't really want to read about, just like I don't really want to read about people pooping. But, it is a part of daily life so I guess it was realistic. So, yay? And I still think the premise had potential. I like the idea of alternate realities, and it brings up some intriguing questions ... like, would you give up things being \"real\" just so you would be happy all the time? Stuff like that. I just wish more exciting things had happened\u2013\u2013because for a book that claimed to be full of firestorms and cannibals ... there wasn't much of either of those things. Over all, I just wasn't crazy about this. It wasn't one of the worst things I've ever read, but it wasn't the best either. In comparison to a lot of dystopian books I love\u2013\u2013for example, the Chaos Walking books by Patrick Ness, or Blood Red Road by Moira Young\u2013\u2013this book just didn't hold up. So, I'd recommend those and not really this one. Yay!

There were two kinds of people living on Earth, the Dwellers and the Outsiders. The former were called \"Moles\" by the Outsiders and the latter \"Savages.\" In fact, the Dwellers were sophisticatedly created by some scientists and thus, they were perfect in everything; on the contrary, the Outsiders were made naturally but some of them possessed specific abilities like clairvoyance or audile. **Characters** (I'll make this as short as possible because it's not my point here.) As I mentioned above, there were two main characters in this book, Perry and Aria. Perry was a tall, muscular, and also has rare abilities among the Outsiders. And there was Aria , a Dweller whose life went totally wrong from an accident. What's special about her was her unbelievably amazing voice, the angelic, falcon soprano. Besides them, there were Vale(Perry's older brother, the Blood Lord), Talon(Vale's son), Cinder(an amazing boy with supernaturally awesome skill), Roar, and some others. **Plot** The story started with the end of the novella and it was primarily about Perry and his girl, Aria's adventure when they met in the woods. In the beginning, because of their different races, they sort of despised each other a lot. Not knowing what Perry was capable of, Aria didn't think twice before showing her emotions or thoughts when she was around him, and that was how he realized that a part of him was really curious about this \"Mole.\" \u201cPerry stepped out as soon as the elevator doors parted. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d \u201cFall off your own roof, Perry,\u201d he said as the door slid closed. Go get her, Perry! When would you stop denying your feeling, buddy? Before he got interested in her, we all know that she was a Dweller, someone who was carefully created(like a test tube baby, imo), so basically everything about her was perfect and flawless compared to the Outsiders. Unfortunately, she wasn't made for living in the wild. With the time flowed, she started to feel unease; her body could barely tolerate the stimulus in the outside world, and she was dying. However, she was so much stronger(and awesome) than she thought, as an unexpected truth revealed by her mother, Lumina, a scientist from her hometown, how miraculously her body worked made sense, umm...though the transformation seemed weird. \u201cAria, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d She stood, moving slow and defeated. \u201cI\u2019m dying. I\u2019m bleeding.\u201d Perry\u2019s gaze traveled down her body. \u201cIt\u2019s not my feet.\u201d Perry closed his eyes and inhaled. Her scent had changed. The rancy Dweller musk was almost gone. Her skin breathed a new scent into the air, faint but unmistakable. For the first time since he\u2019d known her, her flesh smelled like something he recognized, feminine and sweet. He smelled violets. He took a step back, swearing silently as it hit him. \u201cYou\u2019re not dying.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. You really don\u2019t know?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know anything anymore.\u201d Perry looked down at the ground and drew another breath, no doubt in his mind. \u201cAria\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. it\u2019s your first blood.\u201d Huh, I don't know which one is more shocking, the fact that Aria knew nothing about her own physiological function, or that Perry could actually smell something so private like that. Or both. Speaking of weirdness, there were other departments that happened magically in the Realms. Just imagine living in your imagination all the time and all you have to do is daydreaming and then everything you wish will come true. How great the life will be! For example, here was a heated discussion that I enjoyed a lot. *winks winks* \u201cRoar leaned across the table and smiled at her seductively, his dark hair falling into his eyes. \u201cWhen you say everything happens in the Realms, do you mean everything ?\u201d Aria laughed nervously. \u201cYes. Especially that. There are no risks in the Realms.\u201d Roar\u2019s smile widened. \u201cYou simply think it and it happens? And it actually feels real ?\u201d \u201cWhy are we talking about this?\u201d \u201cI need a Smarteye,\u201d he said. Perry rolled his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s no way it\u2019s the same.\u201d Aw, Perry, don't tell me you aren't curious about it. I won't believe you, Scire or not. The bond between them grew stronger and so did their inner connection. (view spoiler) [With Perry trying to rescue Talon, and Aria's attempt to reach to her mom, (hide spoiler) ] both of them had someone to miss, and something to mourn over, there was no doubt the sparks shone brighter and brighter day after day. Their moments became sweeter and more romantic, making me swoon and blush the entire time. They reached for each other then like some force had pulled their hands together. Aria looked at their fingers as they laced together, bringing her the sensation of his touch. Of warmth and calluses. Soft and hard together. She absorbed the terror and beauty of him and his world. Of every moment over the past days. All of it, filling her up like the first breath she\u2019d ever taken. And never had she loved life more. The pure love between them seemed extremely beautiful and peaceful. This is what love should be like all the time, isn't it? Wait a sec, this is just the beginning! \u201cAria rolled up onto her toes. She wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. The soft warmth of his mouth sent a wave of fire through her. Perry froze, then his arms tightened around her ribs as he deepened their kiss. They molded together, fitted against each other with stunning perfection.\u201d Ahhh, I love this sweet moment of theirs so, so, so much! Sometimes I was pretty amazed by how Perry struggled to conceal his true feeling for Aria and vice versa. There were always some subtle changes between them, tiny enough to be unnoticed. And later, they would suddenly get emotional when it came to each other under different circumstances. That's kind of pure perfection for me, too. Although she'd been searching for her mom since the beginning when she said she had to go to the Bliss to do some research, I knew what'd happen in the end. But knowing it beforehand was a lot different from seeing it for myself. Eventually, she found what she was looking for and he did have a clue about that person's whereabouts, but it hadn't finished yet. Throughout the whole story, I've been wondered about the meaning behind the characters' names. Like Peregrine for Perry, Roar for roar, Cinder for cinder, or Aria for aria. Every single name had its own origin and I think the author did a good job in naming them. I could find the relation among them and mostly they were perfectly matched. I'll take Aria for instance, \u201cShe bent close to her mother\u2019s face. Quietly she sang the Tosca aria, her voice warbling and breaking, but she knew it didn\u2019t matter. She\u2019d promised Lumina this aria\u2014their aria\u2014so she sang.\u201d I personally think her name told us pretty much about herself, who she really was, or what she was able to do. Aside from this aria(the way she sang and the song belonged only to her dearest mother and her), another possible reason for her name was the astounding fact that she was (view spoiler) [ probably an Audile. The Outsider side of her showed something more than the surface in the story. (hide spoiler) ] And that just left the readers to explore or reveal something they've never thought about. As for the ending, that was exactly the reason I decided to give this book a half more star in my rating! Just when I thought it would end like that and planned on closing the book, the very last paragraph in the last chapter almost moved me to tears! That scene was seriously beautiful, and touching. It was an implicit paragraph but we all know what it meant obviously. That's the power of words, and it's also the first time I'm deeply touched by them. **What I loved** Another particular reason I like this book is because there was a quote from Perry that reminded me of Raffe from Susan Ee's Penryn & the End of Days series. It's one of my all-time favorite series as well so the feeling of deja vu definitely gave this book some bonus points! \u201cRose.\u201d Aria smiled. \u201cShe told me lots of things.\u201d He cringed. \u201cShe did? What did she say? No, don\u2019t tell me. I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d Similar one for Raffe and Penryn: ( (view spoiler) [That part when Raffe asked Penryn what Pooky Bear had told her about him and then he said \"No, I don't want to know that she showed you me dancing to my favorite song on the rock.\" Or something like that. LOL! (hide spoiler) ] ) See what I mean?! It just made me love this book even more! Most important of all, what I enjoy most about Veronica Rossi's writing style is that she did a fantastic job in depicting everything in details. For example, I really appreciated the way Perry made many delicate observations throughout the story, from the moment he met Aria to how he scented every little trail on either an object or even abstract emotion. In the beginning, I didn't pay lots of attention to these subtle descriptions, but the deeper I got into the story, the more obvious I realized. It was like the first time I noticed how a seemingly ordinary feeling could turn out to be a natural beauty, the kind that I didn't even know existed. The realization made me speechless and I think it's one of the best reasons why you should read this book. **Everything is fine except a small defect** The minus of 0.5 star for this book is that I think the story lacked some necessary emotions. Just because the littlest things were described colorfully doesn't mean the emotional expressions were the same. What I'm saying is that I could picture those details about either the atmosphere around the main characters or the surrounding environment precisely, but I kept feeling incomplete. For me, the exaggerating emotions are the most indispensable essences in a story, but sadly, I couldn't relate to their intensity when they experienced an emotional wreck here. If there were more descriptions on how the characters truly felt, it would absolutely get a solid 5 stars from me, or even more! **Critical thinking** The last and most special aspect I want to share with you is the true meaning of this book from my point of view. This book is not just a story; it's more like the reality in life. For example, because the Dwellers lived in their own world, completely isolated from the outside one and they could simply do anything, or go anywhere by thinking and picturing it, and then the next second they were right there. The place they belonged to was just a virtual Realm and thus in my opinion, the concept is very similar to our so-called \"ivory tower\" . People staying in their own little world and knowing nothing about what happen around them in reality are exactly the Dwellers here so that's why they can't survive by themselves once they are out of their box. Also, since they don't have to learn anything \"real\", they have no idea about what it's like being in the woods, fighting for their life, experiencing intimacy, or putting themselves into others' shoes. Hence, the fact that Aria was forced to live with the \"savages\" is what I appreciate most in this story. It seems to teach us a lesson about how to gain courage, strength, and never be afraid of the inevitable through her experiences and perhaps, you'll be lucky enough to find your Prince Charming during the process. Anyway, all I'm saying is that it's really rare to realize something more than a story in this type of books and I hope you can read it whole-heartedly to capture the profounder meaning on your own. **In conclusion** I highly recommend this series to all of you because of the above reasons and I can't wait to see what you guys think about it soon![\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more I thought Tatiana's comparisons between this and Blood Red Road were spot on, Under the Never Sky is definitely a very similar kind of book but without the strange dialect that sometimes made the other difficult to appreciate at times. They both focus on the dystopian aspect, instead of getting caught up in a romantic whirlwind, they both feature a journey that keeps the novels fast-paced and interesting, and I can honestly say that I cared about the characters in both books.

They both focus on the dystopian aspect, instead of getting caught up in a romantic whirlwind, they both feature a journey that keeps the novels fast-paced and interesting, and I can honestly say that I cared about the characters in both books. The romance, when it arrives, is told perfectly. It didn't feel rushed or \"insta\" and I liked Aria and Perry enough already to want them to be together. Perry was an especially intriguing character, his past and his motives for doing what he does throughout the novel endeared me to him almost immediately. He does seem to think that monthly ladythings smell like violets but, oh well, nobody gets it right all the time... As well as Blood Red Road , I recognised similarities between this and another dystopia I've read recently: Pure . Both use the idea of humanity being split into two, those \"lucky\" enough to make it into the domes and those who are forced to live outside - the latter of which are meant to be the underprivileged and uneducated group. Of course, things are not all what they seem and the domes aren't as rosy as they first appear. A fact which becomes apparent when a boy and girl from each world happen to meet. The difference is that Under the Never Sky is just an all round better book, in terms of writing, plot and characters. In Pure the reader is bombarded with overly descriptive and often shocking imagery, it's okay at first but after a while I began to wonder where the actual story was amongst the descriptions. The characters were only as good as their weird physical portrayal and had little personality. So if you were wondering which of the two to go for, here's my recommendation. Though I can't say this is the best book or most unique storyline I've ever read, I found it very entertaining with all of the elements balanced just right: action, adventure, dystopia, romance and even the occasional touch of humour. I'm really looking forward to the sequel. ...more I tried twice. I only reached 10% so no ratings for this one.

While it did, I sort of never lost that tidbit of confusion throughout the rest of the book. I blame this on the world building. It was a great idea in concept, but sort of fell flat in development. Honestly, the world building was way too half-assed and the plot faded into the background for the majority of the book. And then the ending felt too much like it ended purely to have 1 book become a trilogy. I think this could have been ended in 1 book, just another hundred pages longer or so. But that's just me. I don't want to continue griping about this book. I did like it, I just didn't love it. The one thing I really liked? Perry. All of the point of views from his side were extremely interesting as he's a unique character which a special skill set. Perry pretty much saved the book for me. \u201cShe absorbed the terror and beauty of him and his world. Of every moment over the past days.

In the beginning I had a little bit of trouble connecting with the characters and the story, though I think this is largely due to my strong preference for first person point-of-view. But by the time I hit the middle of the book, I was really into the story. Especially with the introduction of secondary characters Roar and Cinder. They added a really nice dynamic. I also loved learning about the Marked abilities--Seers with their enhanced vision, Auds with their super hearing, and Scires with their strong sense of smell--strong enough to scent emotions. It was all very interesting! As for the romance, I was happy that it developed slowly. Perry and Aria don't like each other at all in the beginning, and even by the midpoint they're just starting to get on friendly terms. By the time they realized their feelings for each other I was like, \"JUST KISS ALREADY!\" I also liked seeing how Aria changed and grew stronger over the course of the story. Aria at the end of the book is so different from Aria at the beginning, and I loved the transformation. Overall it was a great read, and I can't wait to get my hands on the sequel! I'd recommend this book to lovers of dystopian/apocalyptic stories who enjoy romance and adventure with a touch of sci-fi. ...more Yeah, that's right\u20145 stars, glitches!

Want to become a mermaid and swim around? Go on ahead. Interested in the Medieval times? With a quick tap of a button you can be there. The Outsiders are just the opposite. They live off the land\u2014think to more primitive times with hunters and gatherers\u2014and are split into small tribes led by a Blood Lord. There's also something special about people who live out under the Aether. A few of them have enhanced Senses (smell, sight, sound), a sort of mutation from exposure. For example, someone with a smell Sense can scent if someone lies. Someone with a sight Sense can hear miles away. Aria has lived all her life under a dome logged into the Realms. In an attempt to reach her mother (who she hasn't heard from in days) in another dome, Aria's caught breaking several rules that nearly bring down the whole Pod. As a result she gets banished to the outside world, left to die. Perry is an Outsider who's gifted with two Senses\u2014sight and smell. Tension brews with his brother, the Blood Lord of their tribe, and it's to a point where he needs to leave or fight him for leadership. But then a fellow tribe member is kidnapped on his watch and he flees to get that person back. On his trip, he meets with Aria. Although they don't like each other, they decide it's in their best interest to help each other find their loved ones. Before I really delve into my opinion on this book, I noticed how this novel shared similar elements to other sci-fi/dystopia novels I've read within the past year. Everything from Ready Player One, Enclave, Blood Red Road, and Across the Universe. There's a long journey by foot, search for a loved one, an addicting virtual reality, crazed mutated humans, false sense of utopia, enclosed societies, rumors of a safe haven\u2014it's all here, but Veronica Rossi certainly makes her own mark with an exciting new approach and world. The writing was simple, straightforward\u2014it easily thrusts you into this world. And let me tell you the world building was striking and vivid. Majority of the novel takes place outside the Pods and for that I'm glad because I enjoyed going along with these characters and exploring the real . There's just something about adventure/journey books that spark my interest, especially one as engaging as this is. I loved reading about the characters trudging on to new places and meeting new people (by the way the minor characters are brilliant and captivating). It gave a fast-paced feel (hell, they run from cannibals and wolves, dodging any Aether falling from the sky). On a different note, I did find the justification for Pods and Realms fascinating as well. It's not entirely odd that part of society would revert to technology in order to keep the masses from going crazy. Today we are so immersed in it anyway, why not make it a permanent way of life. It was better left to explanation rather experiencing it through a character's eyes, though. Don't get me wrong, the Realms do sound interesting, but at the same time I feel like I'd get bored with it if that was the backdrop for the novel. Under the Never Sky is written with a dual narrative which I appreciated so much. I think it gives a great insight to the main characters Aria and Perry and kept it fresh. I got quite invested in these two, also. With Aria, I was pleasantly surprised. I figured as someone who's been sheltered she'd be an annoying damsel in the distress the entire time, utterly useless. Nope. Not to say that she didn't have her stumbles and flaws, but she was determined and kept trekking on, no complaints on her physical pain\u2014there was something admirable about that. I thought she went through a great transformation, if you think of how far she came from the first page to the last, evolving into who she was meant to be. Perry, hands down, is one of my favorite male protagonists I've ever come across. He's a layered character with so much weighing on his shoulders. He's had a rougher life than Aria's seemingly pristine one, living with what some (his family) have said to be a blessing and a curse (those two Senses). I think his best trait was his innate compassion. He hated Aria, but even so, he protected her, he tended to her wounds. And not just with Aria, but with a few minor characters as well. He sort of sneaks up on you and steals your heart. And the romance! It's so, so well developed. I think I would have punched this book in the gut if it had the characters instantly falling head over heels in love. There was a lot of animosity between Aria and Perry in the beginning. Understandable under their circumstances, a dislike based on ignorance and (view spoiler) [the aftermath of what happened in Ag6 (hide spoiler) ] . But then there's a mutual agreement between them that slowly eases into a camaraderie and then into something more. It felt believable even though in reality it was only a few weeks. And with what they go through, I'm not at all surprised they formed a strong bond. This is a biggie, but I think their relationship is one of my favorites in the YA sci-fi/fantasy genre. There was some well placed humor here and there. Also some great twists and secrets. I anticipated a few things but they were expanded into something that still surprised me. This is such a well rounded, GOOD novel\u2014the characters, the world, the relationships, the plot, the execution. I want to sing from the rooftops that I looove this book! Cookies for you if you get the reference. I even reread it right after (yep, you read that right\u2014not something I normally do) and I stand by my initial reaction: this is an awesome book.

I\u2019d received a lot of advise for the slump: read novellas, read comedy books, and watch more television (which was a really bad idea, because then I watched all eight seasons of SUPERNATURAL in a row). But I decided to pick up UNDER THE NEVER SKY because it just seemed like something that would interest me. And oh, gods, did it. This book bitch-slapped me out of my slump and set me on a ridiculous path to read as many books as I\u2019d missed out while on my little... vacation. UNDER THE NEVER SKY takes place in a world where the city dwellers live in a community known as the Reverie, completely excluded from the dangerous outer wasteland, where cannibals feast and the land is swamped with Aether storms. Our protagonist, Aria, gets into a bit of a fight with some very important bastards and gets thrown out of the Reverie, left to fend for herself. However, she\u2019s not alone for long. \u2018Savage\u2019 Perry is on a quest to find someone, and Aria goes along with him to seek out answers and look for her missing mother. I\u2019m going to be perfectly honest: the beginning of UNDER THE NEVER SKY was no picnic. It was confusing and I had no idea what was going on. I didn\u2019t understand what Aria meant by Pods and the Reverie and Smarteyes and Aether. Hell, I still didn\u2019t even know what the words meant by page one hundred! I would\u2019ve preferred info-dumping to the lack of information in the first half. But slowly, you began to unravel the meaning behind the words, and that\u2019s when the world building got awesome. It was like someone had wiped and cleaned my finger-print ridden classes soon as I figured it all out. I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND IT WAS EPIC The world Rossi had created for her characters was richly imaginative. The science fiction was so engrossing, but the outskirts, outside the enclosed city, was even better. I couldn\u2019t put the book down. I literally considered skipping math class to hide out in the bathroom and continue reading. but the bathroom is full of weave and dirty toilet paper and weird moth bugs so I was just like FORGET IT I'LL RUIN THE BOOK'S COVER The characters all had these realistic backstories and personalities. I didn't like Aria at all for the first half of the book, but as soon as she got her shit together, I really started to appreciate her. Perry I loved as soon as I met him - he was kind of a badass awkward penguin that I couldn't help but adore. And Roar. ROAR, YOU GUYS. okay, so a gif of my baby Castiel exploding probably wasn't my best move ever, but still There was no insta-love in Perry and Aria's romance, though there was a bit of romantic tension after they became friends. Their relationship was so adorable and realistic, and equal . Perry snapped at Aria when she was being a bitch, Aria called out Perry when he was being a unknowing jerk, and it was all well and good. There were also hysterical moments in their relationship, like when Aria thinks she's dying because she got her period, and Perry is the one who tells her that she's menstruating. I was crying from laughing so hard. Roar's relationship with Aria was fantastic, too, because even though he was a flirt, they were just friends, and they both knew it. Roar was in love with someone else, and I'm thankful Rossi didn't pull the dreaded love-triangle card on us. I loved Rossi's writing. It was pretty and easy to read, going along with the intense world-building perfectly. UNDER THE NEVER SKY is indeed written in third-person with both Aria and Perry's points of view - but their voices were so varying and unique I never had to worry about mixing them up. Veronica Rossi got me out of a damn slump with this amazing read, and I have her to thank for many months to come. Also, I blame her for tearing my throats to shreds. I honest-to-goodness screamed and snorted and squealed my way through this lovely work, and while my throat didn't enjoy the ride, I sure did.

I also liked the \"savages vs. industry\" feel. VERY cool. I wish that was done more in books, it's absolutely interesting. That all saying, the world building was shonky. I don't really KNOW why anything happened the way it did. I don't understand the Realms (is it a sort of computerisation thingy?!). The government system seemed pretty lax, too.

It's good!! I like it. I want to know more!! We basically have two populations; the Dwellers and the Outsiders. We know that everyone used to live in the Unity until the Aether brought all these mad crazy electrical storms and caused the people to split into these two separate populations with one group retreating underground and one group staying outside to live in the harsh conditions. There was also much talk of genetic mutations and other untoward happenings so LOTS of distrust between the Dwellers and the Outsiders. So the Dwellers live indoors, and mainly underground, in these huge pods. Everything in these pods is artificial, automated and designed for maximum efficiency...temperature control, food growing etc. There are very few jobs so to speak and to protect themselves from boredom people spend all their time in virtual reality platforms. They enter these VR platforms by means of bio-tech type eye pieces that everyone wears. The Dwellers are genetically modified with children being created and not conceived. In fact these Dwellers very rarely experience something as simple as another human's touch as they spend all their time in these VR platforms. The Outsiders live outside in camps and settlements in large groups or tribes. Their existence is a more primitive one than that of the dwellers. They have to hunt for food and their existence is a harsh one as they have to live underneath all the powerful Aether storms. Certain people within the Outsiders have evolved to have certain gifts or Senses as they are referred to within the novel: Seers have great vision, Scires, great scent so strong that they can even scent what a person is feeling, and Audiles who can hear through great distances. The story is told from the point of view of two characters; Aria a Dweller and Peregrine an Outsider. Aria is seventeen years old and lives in one of these pods in a city called Reverie\u2026.don\u2019t you just love that as a name for a city??? One night, as a sort of dare, she and her friends break into a damaged service dome and tragedy ensues. Aria finds herself unexpectedly cast out to the Outside or Death Shop as the Dwellers call it. Peregrine, or Perry for short, is an Outsider. He is a hunter with his tribe the Tides. He also has two Senses; he is both a Seer and a Scire. Events regarding his young nephew Talon cause him to leave his tribe and when he is alone wandering the Outside he meets Aria. So Aria wants to return to her people to find her mother Lumina but needs Perry\u2019s protection and hunting prowess to help her survive the journey. Perry wants to find his nephew and needs Aria\u2019s help to do so\u2026.there\u2019s a lot of initial distrust and scepticism (he calls her mole, she calls him savage\u2026..sure what could go wrong there?!?!?!) but they neeeeeeed each other\u2026.and then we get two people with apparently nothing in common going on this epic journey together across all sorts of difficult landscapes and the story takes off\u2026.and take off it does!! It\u2019s SOOOOOOOOO good!!! Chapters are written from the PoV of these two main characters and we learn so much about them. There is great detailing to their characters. Aria and Perry learn so much about their own selves from learning about who the other person is. On the journey they face many different trials and dangers and then each character\u2019s own personal journey is so well written! It is so interesting to see Aria\u2019s change from this person who has lived a sheltered and protected existence to someone who steps up to the plate and learns how to protect herself, how to forage for food, how to hunt. She begins to understand more about who she is as a person. And Perry\u2019s story is just as interesting! Ok maybe the characters are a little clich\u00e9d\u2026she\u2019s the sheltered girl and he is the boy who doesn\u2019t really let anyone get close\u2026\u2026but I liked it!!!! :D Oh and well obviously they HAVE to get together because they are just so super perfect for each other and their romance\u2026.it was heady and sweet and gave me so many feelings! I was so emotionally connected to these two characters. I have never felt such emotion in a dystopian set YA novel before. The author really cared about writing detailed characters. There are some great supporting characters too. I loved Roar; he\u2019s Perry\u2019s friend and an Audile who is in love with Perry\u2019s sister Liv\u2026.apparently there is a prequel that goes into their romance and I DEFINITELY what to read it. We meet this strange guy called Marron who seems to run this super amazing camp where they have medicines and computers\u2026oh and Rose\u2026.don\u2019t like her\u2026\u2026..only \u2018cos she once dated or had a brief thing with Perry! Hahaha I am SO predictable!!!\u2026And why is Marron so super nice and helpful?????????\u2026\u2026\u2026am I too cynical??????? Hahaha probably!! :) And then there\u2019s this little scrawny kid called Cinder that tags along with their group\u2026he just kind of follows them! I love him, his backstory seems so sad. So yup, great little supporting cast :) But the one overriding question when reading this book is...just what the heck is this Aether????? To me it's some sort of lightning type electricity that creates storms and other sorts of events in the sky. But what caused it, why is it there?? And this Cinder kid\u2026........ what the what now????????................. ????????GAHHHHHHHHHI!!!!!!!!!! I need to know more!!! Although I am assuming that books two and three will reveal more about the Aether as it is such a huge player in the whole storyline of this series. Ok so maybe there are aspects of the plot and the characters that are a little clich\u00e9d and the writing isn\u2019t out of this world....I would have preferred a clearer difference in the writing style for each of the main characters' points of view... but even so this was great fun. There wasn\u2019t one part of the storyline that I felt bored by. The whole book was this journey leading to somewhere and I wasn\u2019t too disappointed by the ending. It left me wanting more; oh this book was blatantly written as the first in a series! So even though there were more questions than answers at the end of the story it was not left (thankfully!!) on too much of a cliff-hanger\u2026 so that\u2019s a plus-point\u2026 I hate cliff-hangers when I don\u2019t have the next book immediately to hand!! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes their easy reads with a nice little smattering of feelings!

(view spoiler) [Not drunk and disorderly, although that\u2019s happened after some books. (hide spoiler) ] Surfacing too quickly after being submerged in a foreign fictional world, I find myself in a bit of a daze, squinting at my flatmate like I can\u2019t remember who she is and having to be reminded to \u201cuse my words\u201d. I loved the experience of being in the world Veronica Rossi has created in Under the Never Sky. She drops the reader in with little in the way of backstory or explanation, to an extent leaving them to stumble around blind and gradually get a feel for the place. But for me, this wasn\u2019t a frustrating experience. It was intriguing - I needed to know more, to push on, to search out answers in the text. And the detail that Rossi does provide is fascinating. She\u2019s taken some familiar concepts and put her own unique slant on them, pushing together two very different worlds to create a setting of extremes. I\u2019m poorly equipped to examine the technical strengths and weaknesses of Rossi\u2019s worldbuilding, as I\u2019ve already admitted upfront this genre is not exactly my strong point. However from a lay perspective (so to speak), the world of Under the Never Sky reminds me a little of Blood Red Road. Not in that the settings are strikingly similar, but in the sense that both are rich with atmosphere and a curious blend of familiar and strange. The Outside, or the Death Shop, is definitely better realised than Reverie, but that\u2019s probably attributable to the simple fact that the majority of the story takes place there. Possibly the greatest weakness I found with Under the Never Sky was its opening, and I fear that the first few chapters may struggle to hold the attention of some readers, if not lose them altogether. It wasn\u2019t the loud, punchy, gripping opening I was expecting. The book gets going at more of a saunter than a sprint, and keeps this relatively sedate pace for some time. When the story really hits its stride, it\u2019s good, but the slower build up isn\u2019t going to win over everyone. On the other hand, the characters are so well developed and carefully crafted that they\u2019re more than up to the task of carrying this story. Both Aria and Perry have the substance that I\u2019ve found lacking in some comparable novels. While I didn\u2019t find both immediately compelling (read: it took me a while to like Aria), they are both strong characters and their interactions felt believable. However, I do want to mention that (view spoiler) [I wish the element of \"rendering\" had not been a part of this story. While I think I understand how this could work amongst the Scires, I disliked how it detracted from the element of choice and free will in Perry and Aria's relationship. (hide spoiler) ] Perry\u2019s story and motivations in particular came across loud and clear, probably why I felt invested in him as a character almost straight away. Add to this the fact there\u2019s more on offer here subject-wise than romance-masquerading-as-dystopia, namely: loyalty, trust, respect, family and visits from \u201cAunt Irma\u201d, and it\u2019s an entertaining read with some depth. This could be the read-a-thon high speaking, which I\u2019m yet to come down from, but at the end of the day this book is just a lot of fun to read, and one of the stronger contenders in the recent field of YA sci-fi/post-apoc/dystop (view spoiler) [(just covering all bases) (hide spoiler) ] that I\u2019ve read.

The backdrop of the story seems so alien to me and I felt like I will be reading another measly done dystopian trilogy. But wait, after reading the first few chapters. I have proven myself wrong. Under the Never Sky is an original dystopian novel and is a very strong foundation to a trilogy. So, for fans of dystopian series, this series is a must read. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 SPECIAL DEAL ALERT \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 February 28th! Not for us Aussies because Harper Collins doesn't think we're an important market, :P but my American friends can buy this book at special price. Go for it! This is a fun, very juvenile, don't-think-too-much-about-it-or-you'll-find-plotholes dystopian romance. It's been so long since I read it, but I remember liking it. I can't give info on safety, language and sex scenes because I can't remember much :) Give it a chance! This is the fugliest book cover I have ever seen. 3.5 Well color me surprised. I'm at a lost...like...seriously. Look, after those first few pages I expected this to be pure and utter shit. Abominable shit at that. I mean, seriously, that was an awful beginning . Atrocious ! I had to push through. And I only did so because everyone loved this. Tons of friends kept saying it'd get better. I'll let you in on a little secret. I did not believe my friends. I had you all for liars cause I could not for the life of me get how in the world this could get 3.5 Well color me surprised. I'm at a lost...like...seriously.

Again I say, color me surprised! These characters were freaking Amazing! While I was not a fan of Aria in the beginning because everyone in those first few pages were as flat as my ass, she managed to grow on me, heck by the end I was so rooting for her. \u201cKilling a man should be more different than killing a game. It was not.\u201d I think saying I adored Perry is too little for what I felt for him. I adored this character and all his choices from start to finish. I love what he brought to the story, his attitude toward Aria, his friendship with Roar, his love for Talon, and his feral need to fight, conquer, and lead. \u201cShe knew how to put one foot in front of the other even when every step hurt. And she knew there was pain in the journey, but there was also great beauty.\u201d Like I mentioned before, I didn't like her for the most part of the book. This woman annoyed the living bejesus outta me. But if there's something I can appreciate is character growth. And she had just that. The book didn't just showcase her incessant weakness or whining. No, she grew strong, she grew fierce and she grew powerful. \u201cAnd in life, at least in her new life, chances were the best she could hope for. They were like her rocks. Imperfect and surprising and maybe better in the long run than certainties.\u201d The Romance: \u201cShe found it curious and frightening that she could deeply dislike someone she didn\u2019t even know. It wasn\u2019t her. At least, it wasn\u2019t how she used to be.\u201d I think what I loved most was the fact that this was basically my favorite contemporary trope brought into the awesomeness that is a dystopian world. Enemies to lovers. \u201cShe looked up. \u201cA world of nevers under a never sky.\u201d She fit in well then, he thought. A girl who never shut up.\u201d Their hate and disgust slowly grew into acceptance for they needed each other to find their loved ones. Then that acceptance kindled a wary friendship which set fire to an amazing love. \u201cThat was my first kiss,\" she said. \"My first real one.\" He brought his head close, resting his forehead on hers. Blond waves fell around her face, soft against her cheeks. His chest rose and fell as he drew in a breath. \"Felt like the first real one for me, too.\u201d World building: Breathtakingly beautiful landscapes you can vividly imagine thanks to the author's writing. From the dry deserts to the evocative forests to the deserted homes to the aether storms. Lifelike details that brought this story alive. Now this wasn't perfect. \u21e8That beginning left a lot to be desired. \u21e8Words that we won't ever find the meaning to: mega-regess, zap, champ, streaked, barmy, burr \u21e8No backstory to why the world goes round \u21e8There was a time it got too mushy But in the end I'd read that beginning again just to experience the fun I had for the rest of the ride \u2764 ...more Under the Never Sky and I were bound to have a rocky relationship.

Romeo and Juliet did a lot of stupid things for the sake of lust \"love\"\u00a0\u2013 and, as much as recent young adult books have tried to paint Shakespeare's famous tragedy as a \"great love story,\" it's not something that should be emulated or, frankly, even wanted . Thus, coming into reading Under the Never Sky and I were bound to have a rocky relationship.

Romeo and Juliet did a lot of stupid things for the sake of lust \"love\"\u00a0\u2013 and, as much as recent young adult books have tried to paint Shakespeare's famous tragedy as a \"great love story,\" it's not something that should be emulated or, frankly, even wanted . Thus, coming into reading this novel, I was wary of what I would receive. Would the novel be a nauseating love story, or would it actually be able to stand its ground against other dystopian young adult novels I had read and loved? To my surprise, Under the Never Sky actually has a well-realized, intriguing world as its landscape. People live in scattered and closed-off places called Pods, and they spend their time in virtual realities called the Realms. But there are dangers lurking in the outside world: storms caused by Aether swirls churning in the sky, diseases and germs that attack those least immune, and tribes of violent savages and bloodthirsty cannibals. Aria has lived in the Pod known as Reverie for all her life, but one misstep\u00a0\u2013 rule-breaking that leads to fire and a breach in which an Outsider comes into the Pod\u00a0\u2013 eventually incurs Aria's ejection into the dangerous outside world. The Outsider, a Tide tribesman known as Perry, has his own worries and concerns, but one thing is certain: he needs Aria's help to make things right for himself and his tribe. What makes this world so interesting? It holds much of the danger and adventure present in fellow post-apocalyptic novel Blood Red Road , though in a more subtle fashion. The inclusion of \"powers\" called Senses is familiar yet unique, done in such a way that allows for some surprises along the way. The history of what caused the world to fall into this state isn't explored in this first installment, but the lack of information doesn't really affect the logic of the world-building itself. The disappointment, sadly, came with the characters themselves. Aria and Perry are interesting characters, yes, but I didn't connect to them or find them particularly endearing. It was hard to believe, then, that they could connect to one another and find each other endearing. (view spoiler) [(Don't get me started on Perry only starting to feel attracted to Aria once she had begun her period. Or his imprinting-like \"rendering\" that makes him feel like a piece of him is missing when she isn't near.) (hide spoiler) ] I didn't buy that their prejudices against one another could be smoothed over so easily. Wouldn't there be more hurt feelings? Wouldn't there be more distrust and wariness that wouldn't be so easily swept away? It seemed too simple and easy for them to jump so quickly from near-enemies to allies to somewhat friends to something more. I understand that things like war and survival can make brothers (or, I guess in this case, lovers) of enemies, but...will this attachment they have even last during more \"peaceful\" times? Can they sustain what's between them? I'm not convinced they can or, frankly, even that they should. Lest I paint some false impressions, Under the Never Sky is a very readable book, even despite some choppy passages and a conservative writing style that doesn't offer much in the way of \"poetic prose.\" The draw to this novel is the discovery of the world and the adventure, one page at a time. My feelings were mixed, but others may find this story to be a shining gem among the oft-disappointing bevy of young adult dystopian novels to be had. If nothing else, the world-building within the novel is more than enough to give this novel a look. Give it a try if you feel so inclined. Note: I received an advanced copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley. ...more Awesome. I love that Veronica Rossi was able to surprise me, repeatedly, along the way. I also loved that Aria and Perry truly disliked each other in the beginning. It was fun to watch their disgust for one another turn into something deep and swoony. Beautiful writing. Beautiful story.

I have read a few books where every character sounds the same in there chapters and I never experienced that in Rossi's writing. This is a fun easy read.

Rossi doesn't shove a bunch of background dialog about how thing became what they are you learn through the story and some things you figure out on your own. It took me a few chapters to get an idea forming in my head of how this world worked. It starts out in a slightly obscure place. But I kept my mind open and let the world form chapter by chapter and then I was hooked. This is one of those few books I really liked both the main charactors. I think for a lot of people there feelings on the book will rest soley on do they like Perry and Aria. I very much did. I enjoyed that not all of the mystery of what the Aether is was explained right away, it is this mysterious atmospheric shift that ebs and flows like the tides or the ocean. The storms of it are horrible and scorch the earth. The evolution of the people was interesting those on the outside evolved one way the those on the inside elvolved almost opposite possible because of the Aether. The growth of Aria coming from the inside being cast out into the world of savages was great. It wasn't all at once she is a bad ass it took time for her muscles to change for her to learn how to get food for herself and grow into her 'real' life. It grows, you see her go from a soft Dweller to an Outsider or 1/2 Outsider. She is trying to find her place and learn as much as she can along the way. Perry seems harsh at the start but he clearly is a protector. His loyalty is like non other it is fierce and unwavering to those he gives it to. It was hard not to like him. So if you like light romance with some scifi/adventure mixed in a slightly dystopic world this is the book for you. ...more I don't know what I was expecting, but it certainly wasn't what I read, and I loved every second of it. This was a nonstop adventure from beginning to end. There was hardly a moment when I felt bored or uninterested. It was a complete ride and I loved every second of it. My favorite part was probably -- surprise -- the characters. I particularly loved Aria's character development because it felt natural and I found myself rooting for her more and more as the story progressed.

(view spoiler) [ It certainly wasn't love at first sight, by any means, but while I enjoyed the moments leading up to the acknowledgment (?) of their feelings, I felt like things took off really quickly after that. But hey! Maybe that's what happens when you think you might die at any given second...? Also, a bit random and maybe TMI for some of you, but I loved that Veronica Rossi actually acknowledged that people with a uterus have periods! Hooray! (hide spoiler) ] Overall, I really enjoyed this and I will definitely continue on with the rest of the trilogy.

Most people are forced to live in Pods, where everything is sanitized, space is very limited, and life is mostly led in a virtual multiple level world... Our heroine comes from this perfectly programmed and artificial setting and dew to unlikely bad run of fate she becomes the temporary responsibility of Perry, wild, rough, dangerous and barely civilised... Did I mention he is also young, strong, has special powers, is inherently noble, and Hoooout as Helllllll?!!! Our girl is also not a scarecrow, but she is all soft, naive, scared, and wants Hoooout and wild to solve her problems and save her... He is not very keen on doing that at first, since he has issues with impulsive behavior and the consequences thereof are usually terrible, so at that time he is in hot waters and searching for his kidnapped nephew... But Aria, the name of our soft girl whose mother named her after the \"arias\" in opera music, keeps needing saving and Perry is good enough to provide it at need. The book has an interesting, if not too unique premise, and the writing is pleasant. However, at times the background research was lacking and some concepts a bit botched, which I usually forgive if the characters could carry the weight of the rest of the novel. In this case they were a bit inconsistent and only towards the end did I begin enjoying them as individuals... The secondary characters have a lot of potential and that will make me return and read the sequel books for sure! As a whole, I would recommend this as a pleasant read for younger adults who enjoy the Fantasy genre and like to read about a new romance. I will get the rest of the books for sure. Thanks to my BBB buddies for the pleasure of reading this with them and fun reading to all!!! ...more", "Title": "Under the Never Sky"},
