I'm at a lack of words for describing how it truly made me feel -- because this book resonates with my soul and my heart and my mind so wonderfully, it just filled me with awe from within, leaving me drowning in an eternal swirl of emotions, a ruin because of a mere novel. \u201cBut then she snapped your neck.\u201d Tears rolled down his face. \u201cAnd I felt you die,\u201d he whispered. Tears were sliding down my own cheeks. This book is a story about life and love and every gray shade in between. A story about the bleak days and the lovely winds of change. A story about hard-fought happiness and soul-wrenching sacrifices. And a story about a girl who finds herself drifting away into the fields of nothingness only to discover the stars and moon and night sky pointing towards her glorious rebirth. Feyre, oh dear Feyre. I am so so proud of her and who she's become at the end of the novel. She's so exhilarating and vibrant and incredibly strong. But she was not like this in the beginning. The events in the previous book shredded her apart from the inside out, living only a shell of the brave young woman we cheered for. My heart ached for her. But she finds herself again -- her true self,<---M> her wild heart</---M>, her luminous spark of daring, fierce, brilliant dreams. And the heroine that emerges is coated with sheer determination, powerful bravery and astounding compassion. I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal. I was a survivor, and I was strong. I would not be weak, or helpless again. I would not, could not be broken. Tamed. I want to assure everyone that not one character, NO ONE , acts OOC. And besides Feyre, no one changes. You know what I'm talking about -- the alpha-males vulturing around Feyre. ACoTaR only showed us bits and pieces, but we mustn't jump to the wrong conclusions about certain people especially since the depth of ACoTaR felt (<---B>at least to me</---B>) similar to a Vegas wedding after meeting a guy in the hotel lobby, whereas ACoMaF was a reality check . Harsh and cruel and unyielding. This being said, I liked Tamlin. He was true to himself. Everything he does, he does out of love and of fear of losing Feyre. And we all know that people blinded by love can often make mistakes -- and Tam did. Many mistakes. A lack of understanding intoxicated him and an imperative need for control severed his perception. Paradoxically, we get to know him better even if he's not a present figure throughout the book. And perhaps, now that we've seen more of his layers and facades... perhaps we see him in a much different light. He has issues and I truly believe Amarantha messed him up mentally -- nowhere near the trauma Feyre endured, but still a haunting scar imprinted on his demeanor. Regardless, do not mistake all I've said as excuses in his defense, because they are not. They do not excuse his ultimate authority, his condescending attitude and his infuriatingly rash decisions for which he does need to suffer the consequences. (view spoiler) [I just cannot wait to see him get his ass handed to him by Feyre (hide spoiler) ] . \u201cHe did\u2014does love me, Rhysand.\u201d \u201cThe issue isn\u2019t whether he loved you, it\u2019s how much. Too much. Love can be a poison.\u201d Rhysand, on the other hand, was the epitome of damn . I might even have a confession to make... He might... *gulp* ... have overthrown Will Herondale and Dorian Havilliard as my favorite book boyfriend!! Rhys embodies the highest standards for fictional males. His bad-boy allure. His arrogance. His cunning mind. His elegance. His astounding power. But these are nothing compared to his internal beauty -- his selflessness, his nerve-wrecking intensity, his carefully crafted mask, his turmoil and his kindness. His self-doubt brought me to my knees, because he is such a precious cinnamon roll and he doesn't realize it. And holy shit his past was just too much -- I WAS (AM) AN EMOTIONAL MESS. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know how stories get written\u2014how this story will be written?\u201d Rhys put his hands on his chest, his face more open, more anguished than I\u2019d seen it. \u201cI am the dark lord, who stole away the bride of spring. I am a demon, and a nightmare, and I will meet a bad end. He is the golden prince\u2014the hero who will get to keep you as his reward for not dying of stupidity and arrogance.\u201d And you wanna know what? HE'S A GODDAMN FEMINIST . If that doesn't make you fall in love with him head over heels, I don't know what will. Plus Rhys is basically the hottest fictional guy ever created (Darkling + Warner + Dorian = omg). WHY ISN'T HE REAL??? *sobs* \u201cTamlin won\u2019t allow it.\u201d \u201cTamlin isn\u2019t your keeper, and you know it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m his subject, and he is my High Lord\u2014\u201d \u201cYou are no one\u2019s subject.\u201d *** \u201cMaybe it\u2019d be a mercy to be ended\u2014 A broad hand gripped my face\u2014gently enough not to hurt, but hard enough to make me look at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever think that,\u201d Rhysand hissed, his eyes livid. \u201cNot for one damned moment.\u201d *** \"She wins,\u201d Rhys breathed. \u201cThat bitch wins if you let yourself fall apart.\" Lucien remains clever and intuitive and even though his relationship with our heroine gets stranded, his only flaw is undying, blind loyalty and I cannot fault him for that. Moving now onto more serious topics -- the new characters. We have quite a lot, but by far the loveliest ones are Rhysand's Inner Circle. They're squad goals . Fierce Morrigan ; strange and kickass Amren ; sassy, arrogant and skilled Cassian ; reserved and observant Azriel . All these, plus Rhys, entangle a dynamic that creates a family . I loved them to bits. Secondary characters, yet so wonderfully nuanced, three-dimensional characters that gut you with their own stories and make you shed a tear at how much they love each other. Plus, they cracked me up on a constant basis. And the respect and unflinching support they have between them was all kinds of wow and awwww . Okay. Enough with the stalling. Let's venture into dangerous territory aka the romance . *deep breath* I want to start by saying there is no love triangle -- there's only a wonderful, all-consuming and healthy relationship that evolves naturally until it reaches paramount heights. I was constantly plastered with a stupid, goofy grin on my face whenever this couple interacted or was simply in the same scene. What makes them absolutely beautiful in my perspective is the mutual respect, honesty and support they have for each other -- it paints them with an empowering and downright heartwarming glow. Their amazing friendship , their sparking chemistry , their hilarious banter and their hot as hell tension had me repeatedly blessing the gods for Maas. \u201cHe locked you up because he knew\u2014the bastard knew what a treasure you are. That you are worth more than land or gold or jewels. He knew, and wanted to keep you all to himself.\u201d *** \u201cI\u2019m thinking,\u201d he said, following the flick of my tongue over my bottom lip, \u201cthat I look at you and feel like I\u2019m dying. Like I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Besides those strong traits of their relationship, I need to mention the steaminess and sexiness and overall HOTNESS. Because this book? It's hot. Like black-in-the-middle-of-July-in-California-hot. NA, after all. You thought ACoTaR was hot? YOU THOUGHT WRONG -- prepare yourself for hyperventilating, fangirling and swooning, 'cause SJM's writing skills slay in those scenes. \u201cI heard every word between you. I knew you could take care of yourself, and yet \u2026 \u201d He went back to his pie, swallowing a bite before continuing. \u201cAnd yet I found myself deciding that if you took his hand, I would find a way to live with it. It would be your choice.\u201d I sipped from my wine. \u201cAnd if he had grabbed me?\u201d There was nothing but uncompromising will in his eyes. \u201cThen I would have torn apart the world to get you back.\u201d Oh oh oh but there are some other ships that get my blood pumping even though they're not sailing -- YET THEY SHOULD. They totally should. Mozriel and Nessian embody pure awesomeness. (view spoiler) [And Elain and Lucien will be so interesting to see play out! (hide spoiler) ] What I enjoyed tremendously about this particular sequel is how it managed to expand the realm beyond its initial borders, in terms of world-building, depth and history. ACoTaR now seems like a small piece of a giant puzzle, the lovely but common retelling of Beauty and the Beast paling in comparison to ACoMaF which, while just teasing us with glimpses of the real deal that's to come, contained a sense of radiant and vast epicness . The most special and bewildering aspect is the lush and vivid portrayal of the Night Court. Enthralling and contradictory, it completely enraptures you with its seductive tone. So different from the Spring Court (and Summer Court which we get to visit!!). But I expected something disheartening and equally dark, and while this mysterious court has that vibe and then some, there is also such glorious light and normalcy and elegance that reside in its spectrum. The Court of Nightmares gave me goosebumps. The Court of Dreams, however, gave me breath and life. The book centers in Velaris and ohmygod this city ! I loved Velaris with all my being and if there ever was a fictional place or universe in which I'd want to live, then Velaris and the Night Court are it. Plotwise, there isn't really much to say, honestly, besides the fact that the king of Hybern is the new big bad wolf (as expected) and he wants to bring chaos into this world. But his presence is subtle, his threat only looming on the horizon -- the finale will deal with him more. Yet we encounter intrigue and secrets and eye-opening side stories and tales that create the legacy of Prythan hand in hand with the world-building. It felt similar to Heir of Fire , a journey of healing rather than grueling war. However, as in HoF, the last few chapters left me breathless and white-knuckled as I gripped the book to read every single word. Betrayals, alliances, resurrections, magic and evil marvelously unraveled in an explosive punch, a mic drop of a sort. It leaves you craving more the very next instant. We'll see more Nesta and Elain and Tam and Lucien in the next book, that's for sure. But the stakes are so high and the game of hide and seek between friends and enemies so dangerous that I cannot help but be in a continual frenzy until the sequel. It's going to be as much of a masterpiece as this one, certainly. A Court of Mist and Fury made me want to re-read it the second I've finished it -- and re-read again afterwards. It made me want to live in its universe. It made me want to be friends with the characters, tell them how much I adore them and just how precious they all are. It made me feel alive in so many ways that it also rendered me speechless. But you know where its absolute beauty resides? It's in the cleverness with which it was constructed. <---A>Sarah J. Maas</---A> outdid herself -- with the loose threads, with the vibe of Hades & Persephone and with the countless clues and hints that begged for a re-read of ACoTaR in order to pick them up bit by bit. No one can say she changed her creation to her whim, because it was all carefully planned out, mapped out ever since the first page of the first installment. \u201cYou are my salvation, Feyre.\u201d A Court of Mist and Fury is my new favorite book and I'll keep it close to my heart from now on. Enchanting, clever and masterfully written, it shattered my expectations and raised itself on a gold pedestal. I love it completely and I hope you'll do so too -- as fiercely as Feyre loves the night. On a chirpier note though, I'll go drown myself into a hell of a long book-slump because nothing, absolutely nothing can come close to this glorious book while its remnants shine so brightly in my mind .

I was a survivor, and I was strong. Oh damn. That was so unexpectedly good. And to think I almost didn't take a chance on this after not loving the first book... So, here it is: I present to you 7 reasons why this book is a million times better than A Court of Thorns and Roses . 1) Less romance. Oh, don't worry, there's romance. There's lusty, slow-build, flirtatious romance that somehow manages to be completely absent from the first book, even though ro I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal. I was a survivor, and I was strong. Oh damn. That was so unexpectedly good. And to think I almost didn't take a chance on this after not loving the first book... So, here it is: I present to you 7 reasons why this book is a million times better than A Court of Thorns and Roses . 1) Less romance. Oh, don't worry, there's romance. There's lusty, slow-build, flirtatious romance that somehow manages to be completely absent from the first book, even though romance was more central to the plot. But there's also so many other things here. It's a fantasy with romantic elements, not the other way around. I always say I tend to become more invested in love stories when they're subplots and the book itself is not actually about the love story. I like it when the characters come together around and between all the rest of the action and drama. That's what's happening here. Because there is a whole shitstorm of other things going on - which, by the way, has led to better world-building, more exciting action and reveals, and a fascinating overarching story . 2) Feyre's growth and development. And, in fact, the growth and development of many characters. Maas spends some quality time on character histories and backstory to strengthen our understanding of them. I absolutely love it when characters show realistic growth over time and I think that's especially important with Feyre here. Feyre is not the character she was during A Court of Thorns and Roses . How could she be after the events of that book? Naturally, she has changed and found that her needs and aspirations have changed too. Once upon a time, back when she was weak and starving, she longed for a strong protector like Tamlin. Now she is strong, and she needs freedom to train her newfound strengths. 3) I hate Tamlin. Honestly, if you happen to be a diehard Tamlin fan, I can see this book being a huge disappointment. Luckily for me, I pretty much despised him. He's never been anything but a pretty-faced control freak . I'm glad Feyre has seen that and rebelled against it. I should warn you that Tamlin is absent for about 70-80% of this book. And that was just fine by me! 4) I love Rhysand. I foresee the \"oh no, it's a love triangle\" comments rolling in, but I really don't think it is. I actually think this is a great book about growing up and discovering that you're a different person who longs for different things. I don't get the sense that Maas is trying to play out the Tamlin/Feyre/Rhysand angst; she is merely showing a young woman having a change of heart. AND can we just talk about how much better Rhysand is. There's all the superficial stuff like he's exciting, flirty, dangerous and I love the story behind him. He's more fun than Tamlin and I like fun. His banter is wonderful. But I'm also talking about a more important level. Rhysand is, despite being the \"bad boy\", thoughtful and selfless. He doesn't want to stifle Feyre's strength and lock her away for her own protection - he wants her at his side, an equal, a partner in crime. And I love that so much. I like men who see value in strong women . 5) Less sexual. I'm sorry, you horny readers, but I just need to put this out there: I really dislike Maas' sex scenes . Maybe Tamlin had something to do with it but, in general, I think they're overwritten and melodramatic. I also think she does a lot of \"telling\" you that it's hot, instead of \"showing\" how it is, which is a common writing mistake, but is far worse when in a sex scene. It's unconvincing. And by \"overwritten\", I mean that she describes kissing as \"branding\", thrusts as \"breaking\", and sex moans as \"prayers\". Literally none of those things are sexy. She gets the flirtations and banter right - that bit is hotter than the actual sex - but I start to cringe when the clothes come off. A brush of his tongue against the seam of my lips had me opening fully for him, and he swept in, claiming me, branding me. Also, is it really necessary for the male characters to \"growl in approval\" during sex? Not just once - and arguably one growl is one too many - but several times. I'm supposed to be fanning myself with desire and all I can think about is Roy Orbison's Pretty Woman . Mercy. Rawr . 6) New characters. A Court of Mist and Fury introduces many new characters, and the difference between this book and the first is that I found them all memorable, not just the main three characters. Maas has definitely not neglected her characterization and character detailing here. Everyone who comes in and out of the novel has an important purpose, is fleshed out with personality and history, and makes an impact. My favourite was Amren, but I also loved Cassian and Azriel. Our brief introductions to the Bone Carver and the Weaver were highlights too. 7) The ending. Take note: this is how to ensure your reader needs to get their hands on the next book. It's not a cliffhanger, but it is still EVIL. In the best possible way. I loved everything about it. It's the kind of emotional high that leaves you somewhere between wide-eyed horror and smiling gleefully. How will I last a whole year?

Because the story is not only about love, but also self-discovery. It\u2019s about Feyre finding who she is and what she wants . We feel how broken she is, relentlessly blaming herself for the deaths of those ferries she killed and hunted by the horror she witnessed Under the Mountain. \"The power did not belong to the High Lords. Not any longer. Ot belonged to me - as I belinged only to me, as my furure was mine to decide, to forge\" Her character development is simply PHENOMENAL, because through her new adventures, she grew able to accept and embrace all that pain. She became stronger and more determined than ever, while she is still the same stubborn and brave character we love. And the least I can say is: GO. FEYRE. CURSEBREAKER. DEFENDER OF THE RAINBOW AND (view spoiler) [HIGH LADY OF THE NIGHT COURT (hide spoiler) ] . GO. Because Rhys - did I mention how much I love his character? - broke my heart more than once as we got to know who truly he is. SJM made me feel his love, his losses, his pains and overall his passion for his people and Court . \"I stared at up at him, breathless, while he smiled. The smile the world would likely never see, the smile he's given up for the sake of his people, his lands. He said softly, \"I am... very glad I met you, Feyre\"\" He remains Rhysand the mysterious dark high Lord, sexy as hell, playful and shameless flirt but we discover the sensitive Rhysand who feels too much and who is constantly doubting himself when it comes to his family and court. \"Rhys still knelt, wings drooping qcross the white sheets, heqd bowed, hos tattoos stark against is golden skin. A dark, fallen prince\" Because I want desperately to be part of the NIGHT COURT and ITS MAGIC. The world-building was unique and SJM draws an interesting world of political relationships, uneasy alliances, and different races. Because the last few chapters left me jaw-dropping and the cliff-hanger at the end leaves us with so much potential for the next and final book. THANK YOU SJM FOR THIS BOOK. Can I say one last thing?

Probably going to reread this before the final book comes out next spring so I'll try to film a full video review for it then! This could, quite possibly be, one of my favorite books I've ever read.

Can someone please tell her that she can make us love a character without ruining another character? Because really, I ship Feyre and Tamlin, but I will not be mad if SJM handles Rhys's and Feyre's relationship with cleverness. PLEASE SJM, DON'T RUIN TAMLIN. . . . And of course, WHAT DID SJM DO? RUIN TAMLIN! I tried to write my review without major plot spoilers, but there will be some minor spoilers about how the characters were handled. And warning: my emotions over this book are a mess, you'll se how contrary they are! Anyway... let me begin: OH, I was mad! I was so angry when I started reading this book, because it is in the first chapter that you notice that Tamlin has changed and not for good. Now he's an asshole. He's insensitive and controlling, I couldn't stand him! So congrats, SJM, you made me despise my (now former) favorite character in this series. I read a few reviews that said that Tamlin was always like that (a possessive piece of shit), but NO. HE WASN'T! He was caring and protective, not a control freak. I feel that Tamlin changed because of everything that happened with Amarantha. Everyone comments on how Feyre had PTSD and Tamlin didn't try to understand her, but I think Tamlin also had PTSD. What he went through with Amarantha (and with almost losing Feyre) had a huge toll in him. I can accept that he changed because of that, but no one acknowledges it, not the readers, not Feyre, not even SJM. So that must mean that he just changed because he's an asshole (I'm not buying it). My problem is that SJM wanted to force Rhysand on us, like she wanted to force Rowan on us in her Throne of Glass series. Excuse me, miss, but I don't need the love interest to be pushed on me. I can decide by myself. And the thing is... I FELL IN LOVE WITH RHYS IN THIS BOOK! And I think I would've fallen for him even if Tamlin hadn't been the piece of shit he was. Before this book, I couldn't imagine any possible reason that would make Feyre leave Tamlin and fall for Rhys. Not after everything she went through to save Tam, he was the love of her life and her feelings for him were genuine. But then of course, the author put a lot of effort in ruining Tamlin, just so Feyre could fall out of love. What SJM doesn't seem to understand is that falling out of love is normal. It's perfectly fine. You don't have to turn a character into a bad guy for that to happen. Sarah turned Tam into a villain, and that was not necessary. I also hated the comparisons Feyre was always making between Rhys and Tam, so frustrating! They were so obviously put there only to make sure that the reader understood that Tamlin was evil and Rhysand was good: - \"Ugh, Tamlin doesn't let me go anywhere. But Rhys lets me do anything I want!\" - \"Ugh, I had my nightmares and Tamlin never woke up to confort me. But Rhys is always there for me when that happens!\" - \"Ugh, Tamlin only cares about hierarchy. But Rhys cares about family and about his people!\" - \"Ugh, Tamlin doesn't let me enter to his room. But of course Rhys invites me to his!\" ...I MEAN, SERIOUSLY? We can notice that by ourselves, but Feyre kept comparing and comparing during the whole book. Have you read the Shatter Me series? It was as if Feyre was Juliette, Tamlin was Adam and Rhysand was Warner... the very same pattern! First Tamlin was a cinnamon roll and suddenly he becomes a bad guy who only thinks about himself and is obsessed with Feyre. And Rhys was the evil guy in the first book but then you discover that he had really good reasons to do everything he did, and he's a good guy incapable of commiting any evil. Gosh, I really liked Tamlin, but now I simply can't stand him. SJM succeeded! And I had other issues with this book... but that was my main one. I'm afraid this has become the modus-operandi of SJM. Let me talk about those other issues... starting with Rhys. His character really intrigued me in the first installment of this series, he seemed evil, and I knew there was more in him than what he let us see. I knew he had his reasons to act the way he did, and of course I wanted to know why. BUT THIS WAS JUST RIDICULOUS. He's not just not evil , he is too good, bordering in perfection. He's a saint, he's \"Saint Rhys\". There is too much goodness in him. He's also the \"most powerful Fae ever born\", see? It's unnatural to be that perfect. Another issue was that Rhys seems to be the only High Lord that cares about peace and prosperity. He's literally the only one trying to stop the King. The other High Lords don't care about humans! The other High Lords are stupid! I feel like SJM did this just to add more perfection to Rhysand's character: Obviously he's the only considerate Fae that cares about the poor humans, the other High Lords are nothing compared to him! Now let's go to the other side of my review (this will be drastic): Despite eveything, I LOVE RHYS SO MUCH! UGH, SARAH! You did it, you made me fall in love with him! Maybe it's his good nature. Maybe it's his perfection. Maybe it's because he reminds me of Warner. I don't care anymore... I'm just really rooting for him. I don't know how Sarah does it. Even with everything that bothers me about his character, I couldn't help falling for him. And it is rare when I change my ship in a series, but I did in this one because there's no way I'd still ship Feyre and Tamlin after everything that happened in this book (which is sad, because I really shipped them in the first book). Now I can only say that I ship Feyre and Rhys SO. MUCH. Their relationship development was beautiful, everything they went through made their love more real, made it stronger. There is no love triangle here, there are no teams, there are simply Feyre and Rhys and I NEED them to be together. There were only two things I didn't like about their relationship. 1) (view spoiler) [The whole: I DREAMT ABOUT YOU BEFORE I MET YOU. (hide spoiler) ] ... Clich\u00e9, clich\u00e9, clich\u00e9 . 2) The \"YOU ARE MINE\" parts. I mean, Feyre left Tamlin because he was possesive and controlling, but all those \"you are mine\" are not exactly different, right? I don't like that kind of love. It should not be about belonging to someone, it should be about belonging together. I also love Cassian and Azriel. Everything that happened at the end with them made me a sobbing mess! I just hope Cassian recovers (view spoiler) [his poor wings! (hide spoiler) ] , because if not, I'll just go to a corner and cry forever. Now let's talk about Feyre. Sometimes she infuriated me because of all the comparisons she made and because she was always complaining about Tamlin not trying to understand her, but she didn't really try to understand him, either. Sometimes she was really unfair with him (view spoiler) [Except when he locked her up, I would've done the same thing Feyre did (hide spoiler) ] . AND NO, I don't want them back together (NEVER), it's just that she made me really mad sometimes. But in contrast, I think she really grew as a character in this book, she blew me away! The scene with the water wolves was AMAZING. Also (view spoiler) [I cried when the evil creatures attacked Velaris! Ugh, stupid queens!!! (hide spoiler) ] ...I couldn't stand it, it was painful to read. But back to Feyre, I like the directon her character is going. I can't wait to read the next installment! I know Tamlin doesn't have a chance of forgiveness (I myself can't ever forgive him), but I'd like to see redemption in Lucien, he's a character with great potential and in this book he was just too weak. The world building was great, a total A+! I'm still a little confused about the whole Jurian ordeal, but I hope he gets killed soon :). All in all, this book was GREAT, I think that maybe it was better than the first one, and that's saying a lot, because I loved ACOTAR. But since I had way too much issues with it, I could not give it 5 stars. I don't know how Sarah does it... she makes me love her and hate her in every book she writes! But it's more love than hate, I am SJM trash. She's QUEEN. ...more \u275dI was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal. I was a survivor, and I was strong. I would not be weak, or helpless again.

Way back when this series, the Throne of Glass series, and Sarah J. Maas, herself, wasn't hyped up like there's no tomorrow. It was the first book I've read by Sarah J. Maas and the reason I picked up the Throne of Glass series because I just needed more SJM in my life. I was satisfied with the way things ended in ACOTAR so when I heard that some \"changes\" were going to be made in A Court of Mist and Fury, I was a little disappointed. I was NOT a fan of the changes that were made in the Throne of Glass series which was why I haven't picked up Queen of Shadows yet even though the book has been sitting on my shelf since the day it's been released. That's just my opinion. I know some SJM fans are going to start pouncing because they sincerely believe that Sarah could absolutely do no wrong. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE SARAH J. MAAS. She is an outstanding author. I love her writing, her characters, and the world that she brings to life. It was her books that changed my perspective on Young Adult Fantasy, but I honestly wouldn't say that I agree with every direction that SJM takes with her books. I suppose the questions to ask now are: what was my stance at the end of ACOTAR and how did I perceive the changes that were made after reading ACOMAF? Let me address the most important aspect of Sarah J. Maas's books, this series, and probably the thing that majority of readers care about the most: THE ROMANCE. Since A Court of Thorns and Roses was a loose retelling of Beauty and the Beast, my ship of course was none other than Tamlin and Feyre. I loved them as individuals and I loved them even more as a couple. AND I loved Rhysand. Just not as a love interest. I felt like Feyre wasn't worthy of the enigma that was Rhysand. But knowing the trend that SJM follows in all of her books, I figured a change in love interests was inevitable. After all, a book isn't written by Sarah J. Maas if there isn't some character butchering and changes in love interests involved. But after reading A Court of Mist and Fury, I actually found myself accepting the transition in love interests much to my surprise. As much as I wanted Tamlin and Feyre to stay together, I knew it wasn't going to happen. These two people that survived weren't the same people that were Under the Mountain. They're relationship became such a nightmare and so unhealthy. It was two damaged lovers waiting for a disaster to happen. In the beginning of this series, I understood where Tamlin was coming from and why he was so protective of Feyre. It was for Feyre's own good and nobody wants to lose the people they love and/or care about. But he took it way too far. He became too overbearing to the point where he was holding Feyre back. We all understood the trials and suffering that Feyre had to go through but I feel like people don't acknowledge what Tamlin had to go through as well while they were Under the Mountain. It was nothing close to what Feyre had to go through but Tamlin had to watch the person he loved suffer and die. He couldn't protect her the way he wanted and he didn't fight for her as he knew he very well could have. He was helpless and a coward. I think he realized this, which was why he tried to make up for it afterwards by protecting her now to the point where she's being suffocated. It still doesn't excuse what Tamlin does in this book but he's just another damaged character like Feyre and Rhysand. He's just hurting in different ways and expressing that pain in a way the he views would make up for his shortcomings in the first book. Tamlin loves Feyre, that much is evident. He just loves her too much, and that is the tragedy. As for Rhysand, all I can say is that I loved him in ACOTAR and I loved him even more in A Court of Mist and Fury. I loved that we finally get a good understanding of Rhys as a character, the secrets he's kept, and the sacrifices he's made for the good of his people and his court. He was everything that Tamlin was not and twice the man and High Lord that Tamlin will ever be. I'm not completely sure if I'm 100% on board with Feyre and Rhysand yet but I love their chemistry, friendship, and the way they just understand and respect one another. I think I would've been head over heels in love with Feyre and Rhys instantly as a couple if ACOTAR never happened and I didn't get so attached to Feyre and Tamlin. But I no longer ship Tamlin/Feyre and I'm slowly, but surely, beginning to fall in love with Rhysand and Feyre little by little. With romance aside, everything about A Court of Mist and Fury turned out every bit as great as I anticipated a year ago. Sarah J. Maas did not disappoint. I was preparing myself for the worst but instead I got the best. Sarah really knows how to capture her audience with her writing, worldbuilding, and characters that she has created. Of all the new things that were introduced in this book, the new characters of the Night Court were definitely my favorite. I thought the Spring Court was great in ACOTAR with characters like Lucien and Alis but the Night Court was at a whole new level with Cassian, Azriel, Morrigan, and Amren. BADASS is literally an understatement describing these new characters. Besides Rhysand and Feyre, ACOMAF introduced so many new ships and I can't handle all the perfectness that everyone is. I now ship Mor and Azriel with all of my being, just putting it out there. XD And Cassian and Nesta. And Lucian and Elain. None for you Tamlin. Overall, I was glad I waited to read A Court of Mist and Fury because as a result, I was able to dive into the story with an open mind about the changes that were going to be made in terms of romance and the direction that Sarah J. Maas was taking the series. Love her or hate her, Sarah can write one hell of a story and is such an outstanding author. Although there were some parts of the book that went by a little slow, I think A Court of Mist and Fury was even better than ACOTAR in more ways than one. Sometimes I find that sequels may suffer \"middle book syndrome\" but ACOMAF amplifies that momentum knowing that Sarah is preparing to hurtle anticipation and suffering our way for the conclusion of the A Court of Thorns and Roses trilogy. ...more Probably one of the most game-changing books I have ever read.

I can't tell you if I've ever finished a book, set it down, and immediately thought \"I want to read that again right now.\" I read this in 3 days, which is record speed for me, and didn't want it to end.

I can't tell you if I've ever finished a book, set it down, and immediately thought \"I want to read that again right now.\" I read this in 3 days, which is record speed for me, and didn't want it to end. I couldn't get enough of the characters, the story, the romance--all of it. First and foremost, I literally see red when people marginalize this series into a love triangle. PLEASE DON'T. This book is about self discovery. It is a journey about love--all forms of it. Both the ugly and pure side of love. The love for family, for friends, for your people, for your lovers. What you are willing to do for that love, how far you will go, and how it can either build you up or break you down. This book is about choice. About a girl choosing the life she wants to have, and the people she wants to surround herself by. About choosing the path she wants to take and finding her place. It's a hard journey, and at times my heart just broke for Feyre, but by the end of this book I was so, so proud of her. And so profoundly happy for her. There is more to this book than romance, and yet the romance is still damn good. The best romance, for me, is when it becomes part of the character's growth. And that's what happens here. Because this book is about FEYRE more than anything. This is HER story, HER journey. And what makes the romance so beautiful is that Rhysand knows this. No one roots for Feyre more than Rhysand. His confidence in her, his trust in her, his respect and admiration is one of the most beautiful things I have ever read. I can't even put into words how touching their relationship was. How PERFECT it was. Because it had everything. The flirting. The teasing. The taunting. The equality. The trust. The sexytimes. The respect. The teamwork. The cuteness. I could go on all day but they literally had EVERYTHING you could want in a romance. Everything. And when Rhysand reveals his story, you just want to cry at the beauty of it. The way Maas carefully set up this relationship is beautiful and makes you want to go back and re-read the first book. This relationship has fate and epic written all over it. It's a masterpiece in itself that will have you blushing, laughing, giggling, and crying. Simply perfection. <3 I'm not going to get into a huge debate on Tamlin vs Rhysand. I think the first two books make it very clear who is the better choice for Feyre. Bottom line, there's something nostalgic about the Spring Court, about Tamlin and what he did for Feyre. I acknowledge that, truly. And part of my heart hurt for their fallout. Not because I shipped them, but because the hurt was inevitable, and I felt for them. I know there's going to be angry people that think Tamlin \"changed to make room for Rhysand.\" Which I couldn't disagree more with. It's not that Tamlin changed--it's that he DIDN'T change. The hints are there, and are made more obvious when you read the second book. Tamlin isn't a monster by any means, but he's not an innocent ray of sunshine. And he's not the right person for Feyre. Once you get the full scope and things are revealed in this book, it's glaringly obvious. Moving on. I LOVED the Night Court, as I expected. I loved the new setting and meeting the inner circle characters. I wish we got more of Amren, though I have a feeling she's going to wreck havoc on the world in the third book. Azriel is so distant that he took me some time to warm up to, but I ended up loving him. Cassian and Mor are absolutely wonderful and I honestly couldn't get enough of either of them. Cassian and Feyre's friendship helped the void that was not having Lucien/Feyre friendship in this book. (Speaking of Lucien, I needed more of him. He disappointed me in this book but I understand his behavior. I have high hopes for him in book three.) The story and plot really comes into it's own in this book. I appreciate how BIG this story is becoming, when it started off as this b&tb retelling of sorts. It's grown bigger than simply breaking a curse, and yet it completely flows from the first book. I think this is probably the best book I've read this year and I'd recommend it to everyone. If you didn't like ACOTAR, you will love this. If you did like ACOTAR, you will love this. Feyre becomes a heroine you want to root for. The final line of the book had me screaming in excitement. I can't wait to see what's in store for book 3. - - - There are no spoilers below.

I didn't love the initial plot. But I loved the fragments of the world we got to see, and I endlessly loved the flawed characters. The. Flawed. Characters. Beautifully flawed, tragically flawed, humanly flawed. Feyre , who had never gotten a chance to allow her sense to catch up with how quickly her instincts had been forced to grow up. Lucien , whose better judgment was rarely better , and rarely judgment , and who fled physical horrors only to spend a hundred years bracing against mental horrors and came out of it sassy, hilarious and shielded. Rhysand , who traded brute strength and weapons for secrets and schemes, and whose outward battles seemed to wage a larger war against his internal ones. And Tamlin , who was as big of a puzzle at the end as he was at the beginning. My expectations for ACOMAF were astronomical . They were higher than astronomical. I held it to a standard that I thought no book could ever achieve. And those expectations were laughable - just laughable compared to what I got in their stead. My 'astronomical' was surpassed around chapter 5. Sarah J. Maas had me expecting romance, sexual tension, some societal squabbles and light political scheming. But in that world, with those characters, it would have been a dream. But what I got instead... *laughs* ( See: line 1 of this review for my in-depth thoughts. That's right, they are all screaming too loudly for one to winnow the others out. ) (And yes, that was an ACOMAF pun right there.) It's not just that the world expands, it's the wonder it expands into. From a single mansion and a single cavernous dungeon to sprawling courts, kingdoms, entire worlds, all intricately weaved together and all rich and vivid and... amazing. I'm not just saying this. I was dead serious that time I offered up my soul in exchange for life in certain parts of Prythian. The world is that glorious thing that happens once in a blue book (and blue it is!), where to pry yourself away from it makes this real world so bleak by comparison. ( Don't live in books, children. But leave me in this one forever. Do as I say, not as I do. ) I am now a proud citizen of Velaris, and I shall defend it with my soul. (For example, I scream at its enemies when they attempt to uncover it. And by scream, I mean throat: hoarse, neighbors: concerned, explanation: futile. It was a blast.) And then there are the flawed characters. Those flawed characters I loved so much who now evolve. Progress. Regress. Unravel. Dim. Shine. NEVER has Sarah J. Maas done character development like this. Not like this. And never could I have imagined it being this good. One, whose development goes in a way I've never ever seen done in YA to this extent. One, whose development goes exactly as expected - sinister, and cruel, and scheming, and awful. One, whose renewed struggle mirrors their past and regurgitates old fears. One, who was nothing like what they seemed. One, who was exactly what they seemed. And a new cast I loved so, so very much that they are my honorary family and don't you dare tell me they aren't real. I know people who can hurt you. And they may or may not live in Prythian. Beware. But none of this was as mindblowing as the themes . This is a book of plot, a book of messages, and a book of subtle, background romance and powerful, foreground themes. It's a sort of fantasy that weaves subtext of such enormous importance into an utterly engaging plot. I cannot, cannot explain what the exploration of abuse, consent, agency, freedom, depression, captivity, trauma and anxiety has meant to me. There will never be words, possibly. I've done the best I can with the ones I have at my disposal. The real words, though... they just don't exist quite yet. ...more \"When you spend so long trapped in darkness, you find that the darkness begins to stare back.\" Yall... this book... this book and its hype... this book and its hype and all it's spoilers;\u00a0had me worried.\u00a0On\u00a0top of all that\u00a0I\u00a0feared that this book, all 600 plus pages, would suffer a massive case of second book syndrome.

I'm so freaking happy to finally say that this book was AMAZING! As I do with most my on-going series reviews I'm going to keep this review spoiler\u00a0free. Since this book was broken up in several sections I'm\u00a0going to basically break my review down by that. A Court of Mist and Fury is the second book in the A Court of Throns and Roses series. This book starts off right where ACOTAR ended. Feyre, however, isn't recovering well from what happened to her under the mountain. It doesn't help that Tamlin basically avoids talking about it at all cost and he insist that she never leaves the estate. Being trapped in the house just\u00a0wedding planning, with no friends, no family, and waiting for the moment when Rhys comes to claim her for their deal. Feyre is a broken girl the first part of this book. Not knowing where she stands or where she wants to be. So many things happen in the first half of this book, all leading up to Rhys finally coming to get her. That's all I'm really going to say about the first\u00a0section\u00a0of this\u00a0book. The next part of this book we finally get a lot of\u00a0the answers we've been dying for! Answers about Rhys and why he is the way he is, we finally get to see the Night Court, we get to find out so much history on all the other courts, and oh so much more. We are also introduced to so many new side characters... Which easily\u00a0became some of my all time favorites. Mor, Amren, Cassian, and Azriel brought everything to this story! I loved that Rhys decides to surround himself with the best of the best, say F the people who don't see females as badass, and puts two fierce girls as part of his inner circle. Cassian and Azriel, be still my beating heart. I loved these two. What interesting characters. Each with such a unique back story.\u00a0This part of the book was all about build up and setting the stage for the ending.\u00a0This is why it took me awhile to get through this book... but trust me get through it, its so wroth it. The last part\u00a0of this book... God give me strength! I don't know how I'm even going to get through the rest of this review. This section of the book was everything I ever wanted! There is action, suspense, romance, history, and\u00a0twist. Everything that was building up from the first parts were perfect set up for this to be a big bang. There were also so many things that\u00a0I thought were minor details in the first book that\u00a0turned out to be huge reveals in this one.\u00a0I was also so worried that the \"love triangle\" aspect still hanging in the air that it would end up ruining things for me. I can't not address it, and I swear it's not a spoiler, but all the romance in this is PERFECT. It's also why this book is so much bigger than the first, because it's so full of sexy fun times. This book is hot, HOT! I really don't get how this book is still categorized as Ya, I think this jumped right into NA. Seriously, so yummy! I have for sure gotten on the same ship as everyone else. The ending. So much happens. It was so amazing. Shit hits the fan! I did not see it coming. I knew one thing that was going to happen, because you can't not see it, but the rest of it had me on the edge of my seat. I kept screaming \"WTF\" The whole time. Like really, what just happened?!?! Those last two chapters though. Those last two chapters were.... Lord! Oh and that last paragraph! That last sentence!!!! Lets just say it was the most epic!!! I wish my review was a little more detailed, and sorry if it's all over the place, but that's how this book made me feel. A messy, disorganized, and a hot mess. I can't wait till book three. Read this review and others over on my blog Between the sheets & covers blog Between the sheets & covers blog Between the sheets & covers blog ...more THIS BOOK IS AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE. Seriously, I've never been this ridiculously happy throughout an entire story. **I had to add some updates to this business** So full disclosure: I was 100% here for Rhysand and probably would have loved it even if it was just his name scribbled in crayon for 600+ pages. You have been warned of my bias. (Also, I read this whole book on the day it was released, so I went into it without ANY hype. Going into it without any expectations helped a lot). Anyways, Fe THIS BOOK IS AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE. Seriously, I've never been this ridiculously happy throughout an entire story. **I had to add some updates to this business** So full disclosure: I was 100% here for Rhysand and probably would have loved it even if it was just his name scribbled in crayon for 600+ pages. You have been warned of my bias. (Also, I read this whole book on the day it was released, so I went into it without ANY hype. Going into it without any expectations helped a lot). Anyways, Feyre's character growth is incredible and pretty much the central part of the story for me. I wasn't a huge fan of her in ACOTAR, but she reminds me of Aelin in Heir of Fire here with how she learns to respect herself, pieces herself back together, and starts to shape her own future. Feyre develops so much incredible self-awareness, honesty, and bravery (and Rhys supports her but she doesn't grow through him , which is so important). She becomes pretty badass by the end... and is now one of my favorite characters? Man, this book shocked the hell out of me so many times. Look at this character growth: \"I\u2019m thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing that showed me a hint of kindness and safety. And I\u2019m thinking maybe he knew that\u2014maybe not actively, but maybe he wanted to be that person for someone. And maybe that worked for who I was before. Maybe it doesn\u2019t work for who\u2014what I am now.\" I can't really summarize all these feels right now, so here's a list of the awesome: - The Court of Dreams/Rhysand's family and how well Maas can weave different myths & cultures together (like how the Morrigan and Azriel are part of the court of the Hades figure in this Persephone retelling) - every single detail of the Night Court -- I need fan art asap - answers & the insight into all of Rhysand's previous actions - how much Rhys supports and respects Feyre as an equal - actual healthy relationships with communication (friendships too) - the fact that this was never a love triangle - Rhys & Feyre form a solid friendship first (and she helps him tons) - Feyre leaves a toxic relationship for herself instead of another guy - I HAVE SO MUCH LOVE FOR HADES/PERSEPHONE RETELLINGS - awesome action scenes and pacing that never got slow - not seeing Tamlin's name on the page for long periods of time - how Nesta & Elain worked into the plot - awesome action scenes and pacing that never got slow - THAT ENDING. I've seen some concerns that this book might be too steamy for teens, but I really don't think it's a bad thing for teens to read about consent in an empowering relationship for a change. I have seen SO many unhealthy relationships in YA books that romanticize abusive & controlling guys who are attractive because they're threatening (??). Rhys turns out to be the complete opposite of that here (and even if he does become too perfect, at least those positive traits are what's being romanticized). It was definitely more explicit than I thought was necessary, but I also think adults who shield teens from sex scenes have either forgotten what being a teen is like or truly don\u2019t grasp the materials that teens see/read/live. Society has enough stuff that shames teen girls, so maybe ease up on this story about a strong female character going after the life & relationship that's healthiest for her. Anyways, it's funny to look back at my review of ACOTAR last year where I said I'd be a way bigger fan of this series if the books dropped Tamlin and went to the Night Court. Hallelujah. I wasn't particularly huge on ACOTAR, but this just became one of my favorite books. \"Feyre is whoever she chooses to be.\" - YOU KNOW WHO. _______________________________ My thoughts based on comments from others: - \"Being in character\" does not mean that you stay the exact same person forever and that life's events can't change you - Tamlin is still the same controlling character he was in ACOTAR. His behavior just stopped being romanticized by Feyre's POV. - I'm not sure if people who see Feyre as weak or got bored with her vomiting & fear at the start of this book really understand what it's like to be truly broken. - There seriously is no love triangle here at all. - Did everyone marry their first love or how/why is anyone upset when young characters change & grow and find someone new who fits the next stage of their life better?? - Maas is not condoning abusive relationships or Rhysand's previous behavior in any way, and Feyre doesn't fall in love with him while he's still like that thinking she can \"change\" him, etc. - I totally respect everyone who wasn't a fan of this book. The awesome part of book reviews is we can all have our own opinions (so basically everyone chill with messaging me on why this book sucked). ...more \"I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.

I hated everything about it : Feyre's apathy, Tamlin's control-freak issues, the lack of any world-building or, I don't know, plot . Wait - did I say everything ? I lied. Hidden in this forest of dullness and platitude, shined Rhysand. That little shit. Cunning, layered, and oh so intriguing - his scenes snapped me out of my intense boredom. I loved everything about A Court of Mist and Fury . And to think that I almost didn't read it. What a fool I'd have been : I would have missed this nastier, sexier, darker, more captivating and splendid tale. Are you most likely to enjoy this sequel if you hated the first book? Honestly, it depends on what annoyed you in A Court of Thorns and Roses , but if it was the romance and Feyre's boring life in that freaking castle, I'd say yes, yes, YES. Will you like this book if you fell in love with the first one? Maybe. Read further and let see what you'll decide. * SPOILERS FOR A Court of Thorns and Roses * Oh, that . In all honestly, it depends on what you saw when you looked at Tamlin in A Court of Thorns and Roses . As far as I'm concerned, I saw an overprotective, liar ass, and I did not think for one minute that his behavior in the sequel was unbelievable . Feyre was blind to his control-freak issues in ACOTAR but I sure wasn't. Tamlin wasn't a good guy in my book, and here's why (all quotes are from A Court of Thorns and Roses ) Proof #1 : His need to shelter Feyre was already present \"No, I don't want you to live somewhere else. I want you here, where I can look after you - where I can come home and know you're here, painting and safe.\" See, he said something similar in the beginning of A Court of Mist and Fury and it reminded me why I despised him : he never, ever wanted Feyre to be powerful and to learn to fight, oh god no. His views on her role always were traditional and sexist . He, the male, would protect her, even if it meant lying to her, \"for her own good\". Proof #2 : Assaulting someone is okay when you're a High Lord \"I bit her\", Tamlin said, not pausing as he cut his steak. \"We ran into each other in the hall after the Rite.\u201c (\u2026) \"So, if Feyre can\u2019t be bothered to listen to orders, then I can\u2019t be held accountable for the consequences.\" It was her damn fault! She shouldn't have been there! Why didn't she listen to me and stay sheltered! I cannot help! I realize that many people wouldn't be bothered by this because *cheap plot device* oh, sorry - it's not his fault, he's high on Fae celebration or some shit. Yet - yet . That reaction the day after? IS IT THE ONE OF THAT GOOD GUY EVERYONE IS WEEPING ABOUT NOW? Fuck me, really, because I did not see that in him. Nobody told her WHY she should stay in her room. RING A BELL? The way Tamlin keeps hiding things from her in A Court of Mist and Fury was no surprise for me, given the fact that he couldn't be bothered to tell her that she would most likely be RAPED if she got out of her room that day . Fuck you, Tamlin. No, really. Fuck you. Proof #3 : He would go to any length to keep her \"safe\", even against her own wishes Tell me, does Feyre want to leave when he puts her in the carriage that takes her back to the mortal realm? No, she doesn't. Does she have a choice? No, never. Here's a man who says please and means obey , who sure has no hold on his temper when what he thinks belongs to him is threatened. Too bad humans aren't mere objects. This, again, depends on what you thought about them in A Court of Thorns and Roses . I, for one, saw a broken girl who needed to be protected and was blinded by a castle and his handsome master . I did not see love, but merely attraction, and even then, their absence of chemistry made me wonder why the fuck she stayed with him (she could paint, though). \"I\u2019m thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing that showed me a hint of kindness and safety. And I\u2019m thinking maybe he knew that\u2014maybe not actively, but maybe he wanted to be that person for someone. And maybe that worked for who I was before. Maybe it doesn\u2019t work for who\u2014what I am now.\" There.\" But this frightened, broken girl is dead . Her need to be sheltered and protected vanished, and with it, her acceptance of Tamlin's tantrums. I personally loved how she addressed the fact that her own growth made her seek another kind of relationship, and I thought that it was realistic and believable . While Tamlin cannot see that his overprotective behavior suffocates her, Rhysand wants to give her the tools to be independent and self-reliant, free . In what world - I mean it - in WHAT WORLD am I supposed to expect her to stay with someone who thinks that she doesn't need to be powerful? \"And I realized\u2014I realized how badly I'd been treated before, if my standards had become so low. If the freedom I'd been granted felt like a privilege and not an inherent right.\" First of all, it was pretty obvious from the moment we met him in A Court of Thorns and Roses that the High Lord of the Night Court was more complex than he wanted us to see. Yes he is cunning and yes he's ready to make harsh decisions in order to reach his goals. I won't deny it, because that's part of what I love about him. When it comes to fairies who are hundreds of years old, I do not expect some knight prince in shining armor. Of course he isn't! Yet the sacrifices he made for his people, the masks under which he hides make him so much more captivating and endearing. It does not mean that I excuse all his actions, but contrary to Tamlin, he is honest about who he is, and I respect him for that. Not to mention that the growth of his relationship with Feyre - gradual, slow, and full of tension - was everything I wanted in A Court of Thorns and Roses and didn't get . These two made my heart pound, drove me to giggle at their constant banter , shared a hell of a chemistry and the way he supported her in her freedom made me want to hug the guy. I will always prefer a hero who wants the heroine to be strong and lets her make her own choices. ALWAYS . This wicked Lord is just right up my alley, okay? He's full of surprises and everything I expected him to be - even more, if I'm being honest. I understand and love him, and I won't be sorry about that. Also, sexting through magic notes should totally be a thing. Finally, the new characters he brings with him? Absolutely delightful. And by that, I mean the best kind of crazy (Amren, I'm looking at you). YES THERE IS! I am so glad to inform you that we finally get to explore the world and let me tell you, it was fantastic : from the beautiful descriptions of the settings (plural) to the numerous details about the politics at stake, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that we weren't drowning into some blank space like in A Court of Thorns and Roses . Don't look at me like that - what did she do in A Court of Thorns and Roses except painting and swooning over Tamlin? Nothing . If the plot got better once they were under the mountain, it remains that the romance was so overwhelming that I wouldn't have called the first book fantasy for one second. This sequel is different : if the romance is still there, it takes a step back and there is an actual plot to follow. Thank you. As for Feyre, if her new powers flirt dangerously on spechul snowflake territory at some point, it remains that her growth and development is perhaps what I loved the most about this book (okaaaay, except Rhysand, but come on) . Gone is the idealist human, who thought that the boundaries between right and wrong were impermeable : she's no stranger to fear, but she's more ruthless, cunning, and fierce . With Rhysand's help, she finally becomes the heroine of her own life, and I really, really appreciated that. I say YES to women's empowerment. Of course I say yes. I HAVE NO IDEA. The ending was fantastic, epic, and left me starving for MORE. Well done. \u25ba Granted, A Court of Mist and Fury wasn't perfect by any means, the writing was a little too dramatic for my tastes and the comparision between Tamlin and Rhys lacked subtetly sometimes. Yet I loved every second of it , and for that, it deserves its 5 stars. PS. \"In an interview, Sarah J Maas stated that Rhys would be sorted into Slytherin if he attended Hogwarts.\" NOW I KNOW.

A COURT OF MIST AND FURY IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE. ***CONTAINS A SHIT TON OF SPOILERS*** REALLY, IF YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED THE BOOK YET, DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW. THIS BOOK IS WAAAAAAAY MORE THAN 5 STARS, IT'S MORE LIKE 1000000000000000/5 STARS. I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE PERFECT BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GONNA BE THIS PERFECT. To be completely honest with you guys, I have absolutely no idea where to start, so I'm warning you, this is gonna be far from an actual review. May 3rd was the day I died. I ran to my mailbox, knowing what awaited me there. I opened it and saw the box, amazon prime tape all over it. I took it and ran back inside my house. I stared at the box and took a deep breath... THEN RIPPED THAT SHIT UP. I CLAWED AT IT, SHREDDING THE WHOLE FUCKING BOX IN THE PROCESS. I SAW THAT BLUE FUCKING COVER AND KNEW THAT MY LIFE WAS NEVER GONNA BE THE SAME. I TOOK THAT FUCKING BOOK AND TURNED THAT SHIT OVER. THE COVER WAS FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. SCREAMING LIKE I WAS BEING TORTURED IN THE DEEP PITS OF HELL, I RAN AND SAT MY ASS DOWN ON THE COUCH. I OPENED THAT SHIT UP AND READ TIL MY EYES BLED. DAMN STRAIGHT. So all I read in the first 40 pages or so was blah blah blah Tamlin blah blah blah Where's Rhys. And then the moment we've been waiting for happened. The moment where RHYSAND INTERRUPTS FEYRE'S WEDDING TO BRING HER TO THE NIGHT COURT. FUCK YEAH. The Night Court is the most beautiful thing ever. Could it be any better? No. It was perfection. And when Rhys winnows with her there, Feyre's first instinct is to throw a shoe at him. THE ALL-POWERFUL, MOST FEARED HIGH LORD OF THE NIGHT COURT GOT HIT BY A SHOE. It was adorable. And Rhys helped teach Feyre how to read and it was the best thing ever. All the while training her on her new found powers. These powers came from the seven High Lords and Feyre has all of them. EVEN RHYS'S Feyre became a very strong character in this book, Sarah knows how to work in that character development! She knew how to fight for herself and always wanted to be there to help in times of need. And the reason for leaving the Spring Court forever was because stupid Tamlin didn't let her go anywhere and practically made the estate Feyre's new prison cell. How symbolic. Remember that time Under the Mountain, Tamlin? When your \"beloved\" was trapped in that same cell for three whole months? How you didn't do anything about it and watched her rot? How on her last day Under the Mountain, you wanted to have sex with her instead of trying to free her? Ever think of those things Tamlin? Doesn't seem like it because now you've recreated that same cell that's caused her so much trauma. Isn't he the greatest. When Feyre made the decision to stay at the Night Court with Rhys and the squad (who I adore so much by the way), I was so happy. Not just because that meant Rhys and Feyre time (whoo!), but because it showed how strong she's become and that she finally escaped the captivity of the Spring Court into the freedom of the Night Court. And she is a total bad ass. The Night Court squad is so awesome. We've got Mor, Amren, Cassian, and Azriel who I love all equally. They all have character depth, flaws, and pasts that we learn about. Mor's past was devastating and made me want to just give her the biggest hug. I also enjoyed amren a lot because she looks like she could kill you and will actually kill you. And Azriel and Cassian are also really fun to read about as well. They are all cinnamon rolls. Let me just say, I love it when the girl saves the guy. In this case, it was Feyre saving Rhysand. They were flying and Rhys was hit in the back with ash arrows and was captured and whipped. Now Feyre, she was MAD. She winnowed and killed the guys torturing Rhys like the total boss she is and saved Rhys from death. I was seriously so scared for my baby. NOW IS THE TIME TO BRING IT UP GUYS. THE MOMENT WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. WE WANTED IT TO HAPPEN FOR SO LONG. AND NOW IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN. READY THE CANON. RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE MATES. RHYSAND. AND. FEYRE. ARE. MATES. THE FANDOM RIGHT NOW. AND RHYS HAD DREAMS ABOUT FEYRE BEFORE HE EVEN MET HER. WHEN HE FIRST MET FEYRE HE HAD A SENSE THAT THEY WERE MATES. HE KNEW THE WHOLE TIME, AND IT BROUGHT MORE TEARS TO MY POOR EYES. IT ACTUALLY MAKES ME WANT TO REREAD A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES JUST TO HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW ON IT. AND RHYSAND REALIZED HE LOVED FEYRE WHEN HE HELD THE DAGGER TO AMARANTHRA'S NECK. RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE MATES AND EVERYTHING IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD. AND WHEN RHYS TOLD FEYRE EVERYTHING, (AND I MEAN EVERYTHING)...(LIKE REALLY EVERYTHING), I CRIED. IT WAS SOOOO.... I'M SORRY I CAN'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS, BUT YOU PROBABLY FELT THE SAME THING. YOU KNOW. AND THE NIGHT OF STARFALL. OMG MY BABIES. THEY WERE AT THE BALCONY AND THEY WERE SHARING PERSONAL THINGS (I LIVE FOR THESE MOMENTS). AND THE ABSOLUTE MOST ADORABLE THING THAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN THEY BOTH WERE HIT IN THE FACE BY THE STARLIGHT AND LAUGHED. LAUGHED. AND SMILED SO MUCH. FEYRE HADN'T SMILED LIKE THAT IN FOREVER. AND OH DEAR LORD SAVE ME, I'M PICTURING THE GRIN RHYSAND GAVE FEYRE RIGHT NOW AND IT MAKES ME MEEEELLLLTTTT. I JUST SIMPLY CANNOT. Now, let's talk about the hottest scenes ever between my dear Rhys and Feyre. THEY WERE SO STEAMY AND I WAS FREAKING OUT THE WHOLE TIME. I DIDN'T KNOW IF THIS WAS REAL LIFE OR NOT. AND THEY LASTED PAAAAAGGGGEESSS. A GLORIOUS AMOUNT OF PAGES. THESE WERE THE FELLOW STEAMY SCENES: COURT OF NIGHTMARES. THE CRAMPED BEDROOM. MATE REALIZATION. (THE BEST ONE) And Rhys is not who we expected him to be. He's sacrificed so much for his people like I can't even explain because HE SACRIFICED SO DAMN MUCH. And I seriously cried when he revealed all these things about himself. MAIN CAUSE OF MY EMOTIONAL TRAUMA RIGHT THERE . I could go on and on forever about the many many many precious Rhys and Feyre moments, but let's talk about that ending. Things were so perfect so far that I was getting scared. Scared that all that perfectness was going to be ripped away and I was going to be one emotional mess. And for a minute there, I was. You guys know what I'm talking about. So Feyre and Rhysand acted like Feyre was under Rhysand's control the whole time so it made it seem like Feyre actually still loved Tamlin and that she wanted to go back with him. And then she wanted to make it seem more real. And I'm like \"FEYRE IF YOU FUCKING TELL THE KING TO BREAK YOUR MATE BOND I SWEAR-\" And then she tells the king to break the mate bond. And Rhysand's screams just shattered my heart when he was about to. And shithead Tamlin's says \"Do it.\". AND THE FUCKING KING OF HYBERN BROKE RHYS AND FEYRE'S MATE BOND. I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER THEN AND THERE. I COMPLETELY LOST MY SHIT. BUT WAIT. IT'S NOT OVER. RHYSAND AND FEYRE WERE ALSO ACTING THAT OUT TOO. THE MATE BOND WASN'T BROKEN. I REPEAT, THE MATE BOND WAS NOT BROKEN. THE KING JUST BROKE THE BARGAIN WITHOUT REALIZING IT WASN'T THE MATE BOND. THAT LOVE CANNOT BE BROKEN, ESPECIALLY RHYSAND AND FEYRE'S. AND SO NOW THIS SETS UP THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD BOOK. FEYRE IS GOING TO SPY ON THE SPRING COURT AND SEND THE INFORMATION DOWN THE MATE BOND TO RHYS. YEAH FEYRE YOU GO GIRL. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Nesta and Elain were turned into High Fae. And Lucien is mated with Elain. Crazy, am I right?! AND FEYRE IS NOW HIGH LADY OF THE NIGHT COURT. I AM COMPLETELY SPEECHLESS AND AM STILL IN UTTER SHOCK AT HOW BEYOND AMAZINGLY PERFECT A COURT OF MIST AND FURY WAS. I CAN'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS. EVEN A GIF. I JUST-- WOW. YOU GUYS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M FEELING RIGHT NOW. RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE EVERYTHING I EVER WANTED. THE THIRD BOOK SHOULD BE CALLED \"A COURT OF PAIN AND EMOTIONAL TRAUMA\" BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT'S PROBABLY GONNA GO. HERE COMES THE YEAR LONG WAIT. I DON'T THINK I'LL SURVIVE WITHOUT IT LONG ENOUGH. I WANT IT SOOOOO BADLY!!!!! AND I'M MEETING FUCKING SARAH J. MASS ON THE 14TH AT THE CHICAGO BOOK CON TO GET MY COPY OF ACOMAF SIGNED AND MEET HER IN THE PROCESS! I'LL MOST LIKELY BE RENDERED SPEECHLESS JUST LIKE AFTER I FINISHED ACOMAF. I AM SERIOUSLY SO EXCITED. I WILL SAY IT AGAIN: A COURT OF MIST AND FURY IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE. \"To the stars who listen-- and the dreams that are answered. ...more I have ALOT to say..

I\u2019d like to speak to a variety of audiences and opinions here. But please note, this book is not for everyone . Hopefully I can clear some of that up. I will mark spoilers, I promise. But before I get into it\u2014 This was a buddy read with the lovely Laurie who has the biggest heart\u2026 Thank you for s I have ALOT to say.. (as I\u2019m shaking all over. Literally shaking.) **cracks knuckles** So, I\u2019d like to gently speak my mind.. and address some of the conflicting arguments about this from my point of view.

But before I get into it\u2014 This was a buddy read with the lovely Laurie who has the biggest heart\u2026 Thank you for sharing this with me!! GO read her review! And to Cait who let me message her like 10x an hour (no joke) and helped me get through this book... seriously THANK YOU . I wouldn\u2019t have survived. Also- I totally made a spotify playlist for this book. Not sorry at how lame that sounds.. check it out HERE!! Now\u2026 To those who are afraid of a love triangle: This book, I believe, will surprise you. This is NOT a love triangle. This is NOT an overlapping story of a girl who is torn between two men. This is NOT a book of angst or decision making of who suits Feyre better. To those who are hardcore Tamlin shippers: I think the news has spread that your love interest will be challenged in this book. All I can tell you.. or ask of you, is that you go into this book with a realization that you truly don\u2019t have all the information of what really happened in the first book. Let SJM reveal this to you in her own way. If you don\u2019t want your feelings to bleed a little bit.. and you want a glitzy continuation of the little fairytale romance you got in the first half of the first book, this book is NOT for you. Yes, she sacrificed immensely for him\u2026 but that DOES mean something and is not swept under the rug.. even if this book challenges her former motive on it. It changed the world, and you see the result. And you know what? I think you get something far better than you could ever hope for in return. To those who do not like the idea of Maas changing a love interest and are really peeved with her writing style: I feel you. I really do. It is only because you have a big heart that you want true love to happen and stick to the characters. I can\u2019t tell you if you will like this book- but I can promise you a wild ride of REALISTIC emotions\u2026 characters that make mistakes out of broken hearts, characters that are broken, shattered, and misunderstood. Just like real life. Just like people we talk to every day. All that to say- I do think this differs quite a bit from what happened in ToG... (view spoiler) [YES there are similarities, but this is on another level, folks. Though- I adore Heir of Fire, and I'll defend what SJM did there. (hide spoiler) ] And if you\u2019re up for a spoiler to ease your mind some.. (view spoiler) [ After this book, whatever the result, the ship is NOT changing again. See more below. (hide spoiler) ] To those who believe the characters are acting out of character: I understand why you think this. I really really do. But here\u2019s my quick two cents\u2026 and since you have probably already read at least part of this book\u2026 (view spoiler) [ We.. as readers.. believed so much of what we read in the first book. Like Feyre, we soaked up the sparlkly love in the book\u2026 we didn\u2019t see the warning signs of the relationship that she sacrificed everything for. I went back and reread parts.. and I realized that Maas was leaving us clues the entire first book. Tamlin is not perfect.. and he is acting out of the own holes in his heart. All of the characters are hurting in the first part of this book. All of them. I could talk so much more on these points\u2026 like with Rhys being softer.. just wait until his explanation of things. And if you have a problem with him not being evil and conniving, I don\u2019t know what to tell you.. but I, for one, am absolutely floored at his depth. I do believe at the very end though- I don\u2019t think Tamlin would have really done that- but it just shows how desperate he was.. the lengths he went to... (hide spoiler) ] To those who hope that Rhys stays a villain in this book Read the spoiler at your discretion. (view spoiler) [ I\u2019m sorry, but you will be disappointed. Some say he isn\u2019t as awesome to read about as he was in the first book- but he gained so many levels of my respect.. and he was STILL as hilarious, cunning, powerful\u2026 as he ever was. (hide spoiler) ] So needless to say.. he is without a doubt- one of my all time favorite characters. Easily. Now onto the plot itself\u2026 **Mild spoilers** but I\u2019ll mark the really big ones Feyre is utterly and completely broken at the beginning of this book. She has every right to be. She is suffering from serious post traumatic stress. I guess a lot of readers are giving her a hard time for it but I\u2019d like to see anyone go through the amount of hell this girl went through and come out any better than she. Any of you (like me) who have suffered through anxiety/panic attacks/etc will be able to relate to her in this, I think. This story is a story HEALING. Renewal. Transformation. And so much more. I was absolutely floored at how RAW and unfiltered this book is. At the complete HONESTY of this book. Everything I thought I knew.. well just you wait. Every single page put a smile or a massive amount of tears on my face. This book made me feel every emotion very deep within my bones. As for the relationship... (view spoiler) [This, to me\u2026 depicts what love SHOULD look like. Feyre gets out of a relationship that she didn\u2019t realize was toxic until it nearly killed her. YES, Tamlin was only trying to protect her and show her love in his way, but it wasn\u2019t right. Good intentions do not always mean good decisions. Love should not be based on the physical demands of a relationship. Love is selfless, love does not envy. Tamlin would not communicate with her.. he did not see her as his equal, as his team mate\u2026 he only saw her as a lover. Rhysand stepped in and shattered all of those lies planted in her head. He EMPOWERED her\u2026 he lifted her up.. he gave her free will. Yes, Tamlin was made out to be a little bit of a monster in this book.. YES I see why that upsets people. But here\u2019s the thing\u2026 Maas was making a point here\u2026 one that I whole heartedly agree with. You do NOT have to stay in a relationship that binds you up. And Rhys's love for her left me speechless. (hide spoiler) ] I could put a million beautiful quotes in the book here for you- but I want them to be a surprise. ....AND HOLY FREAKING CRAP OF THE WORLD... that ending was INTENSE. (Hence why I am still shaking an hour after finishing this book....) No, this book isn't perfect. There are most definitely flaws and things Maas could have done better (seriously, stop with the purring.) While I agreed with most of the relationship issues and the way things were handled, not everything is perfect. Regardless, this book is just plain fun. Who cares if you feel super deep about it or not? And lastly\u2026 yes there are a few minor things that I disagreed with. And dear readers\u2026 please note that this book is EXTREMELY graphic. I would have preferred certain scenes to not be so...TMI... or explicit.. so sensitive readers, beware. Somehow audible has this listed for 11-13 year olds. Please do not let your 11 year old child read this book\u2026 this is NA, not YA. *though small note- I'm seeing a lot of buzz about sexual situations that didn't actually happen in this book... like did we read the same book? Yes, there is explicit content- but not the way I've read in some of the reviews. The marketers of this book should be held responsible for not labeling it correctly - so those who are upset should message them / spread the word. One last update.... Sheesh. My heart saddens to see all the turmoil that has been going around the goodreads community. Lets remember to be respectful of other's opinions. This book is not for everyone . It will have a negative effect on some, and a positive one on others. This goes for both ends- those who love this book and those who do not. Stop with the nastiness.

Thank you. <3 (I told you reading this book was so much fun.) --- \u27a4 The book, in brief: \u201cStop comparing. Stop comparing me to him.\u201d Because do you know what it is called when you keep and keep and keep comparing the previous love interest to the current one, and each single one of these sugary , clich\u00e9d , obvious and trite comparisons invariably leads to the conclusion that the ex is a prick while the newcomer is a Perfection Milkshake? No, Maas? I thought so. Oh well. I\u2019m going to say this just once: it\u2019s called manipulation . Now look at me, Maas. Do I look like a reader who enjoys being manipulated to you? No? Why, I thought so . To all those who still have to start this series and are intentioned to: don\u2019t read A Court of Thornes and Roses . Spoil yourself a little of what happens there and start with this one . Because -and this is the truly sad thing, as someone else said before me- A Court of Mist and Fury could even be enjoyable if the first book had not happened before. \u2022I won\u2019t go as far as saying that what we have here is a case of lack of \u201cshow\u201d and an excess of \u201ctell\u201d, because the first chapters do show that Tamlin, whether for some PTSD or because he has always been a scumbag, undeniably acts like the worst man on the planet. I am even willing to forgive how caricatural his behaviour appears. But, throughout the book, every occasion is a good occasion to throw in a comment to overturn completely also all the positive parts of him that are showed in the first book. (In this regard, I should say that in A Court of Thornes and Roses I did not care for Tamlin in any way, so I am not speaking out of frustrated adoration.) In this scenario, Tamlin is the epitome of all evil, while Rhys, of course, the epitome of all good : Tamlin cares for hierarchy, Rhys cares for family and nothing more (ugh); Tamlin wants her caged, Rhys want her free; as it turns out, (view spoiler) [it was Tamlin\u2019s betrayal to begin the feud between his family and Rhys\u2019s (hide spoiler) ] , and so on. I am not in any way saying that a man shouldn\u2019t give freedom to his woman (it\u2019s not that he should; he must , uncompromisingly), or that a plot-twist like the one I mentioned isn\u2019t a good turn of events, even in terms of characterization, but everything is just so stereotypical and trite and sickly sweet . All of this, in the name of a ship . I think Maas should understand that falling out of love is just as normal as falling in. People fall out of love for normal reasons even if their exes don\u2019t suddenly turn into maniacs. I am sick of this device , courtesy of Queen of Shadows , and I don\u2019t need the new love interest to be pushed on me: I am perfectly able to decide for myself. \u2022I\u2019ve seen some reviews in which these two characters are described as complex and multifaceted on the basis of their role reversal. Allow me to say that, in my opinion, nothing about them, in this book, is complex nor controversial . Maas did nothing more than switch their places and their personalities with them : Tamlin was the good one and turns out to be the villain; Rhysand was the villain (somehow, and indeed the Rhysand of the first book is the one I can honestly call intriguing) and now he is nothing short of a Fae Prince Charming. Simple as that. Besides, I liked Rhysand in this book, but I deeply missed the more wicked, morally grey part of him that we saw Under the Mountain. He\u2019s hot, sure, but he also comes off as flat and, at times, pathetic . \u2022It was a dick move (view spoiler) [to lock Feure up in the mansion (hide spoiler) ] , yes. And yet, I can\u2019t wrap my mind around Feyre\u2019s fickleness, considering that two chapter later she says this: \u201cI'm thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing -thing? Now he\u2019s a thing?- that showed me a hint of kindness and safety. And I'm thinking maybe he knew that- maybe not actively, but maybe he wanted to be that person for someone. And maybe that worked for who I was before. Maybe it doesn't work for who- what I am now.\" She had every right to leave the mansion and let him stew for a while, but if that is the result of months and months of undying love, well. He stopped being worth of her love maybe, but I don\u2019t think she fought for it that hard either, especially if he really was dealing with some PTSD. I think love is also about trying to fight for the other person even when they don\u2019t seem to fight for us, to give them time, to give them chances, even though at one point we have to stop. It just would have been nicer and more enjoyable if Feyre\u2019s affection\u2019s shift hadn\u2019t been so swift , that\u2019s it. \u2022 All the contradictions . Feyre leave her abusive boyfriend, but then falls in the arms of a man who breaks every bone of a guy who called her names. Uh-uh. And if you say \u201cHe did that because he called her \u2018whore\u2019, and he\u2019d been called whore too, and the trauma \u201d, I say: how do you know Tamlin\u2019s behaviour wasn\u2019t due to his trauma too. Maybe he just needed time. But it\u2019s okay if it\u2019s Rhysand that does that because epitome-of-perfection, remember? His being all possessive is okay. He can say things like \u201cShe\u2019s mine\u201d and snarl at people who so much as look at her. And don\u2019t get me started on indecent exposure. \u2022The new characters are all nice and pretty and invariably haunted by a dark dark past. It\u2019s nice to read about them and to witness their banters, but they don\u2019t stand out as particularly well-written or sophisticated. \u2022The plot is even weaker than Maas\u2019s usual. And contrary to what I usually do, I\u2019ll sum it up for you: Feyre flees. The My Little Ponies gang - ops. I meant the Court of Dreams\u2019 defenders (I know, the ponies were cooler) look for Things. Which do Stuff. Precisely, destroy Taran\u2019s Black Cauldron and defeat The Horned King, minus the fluffy Gurgi. Well, wrong story, but that's basically what happens. In more than 600 pages . \u2022 People purr . Normal cats, thank God, ordinarily talk like freaking civilized beings. \u2022The first time (view spoiler) [Rhysand and Feyre have sex and he climaxes, the mountains tremble (hide spoiler) ] . I refuse to comment on this thing, and if it was me who had written such embarrassing idiocy, I would be hiding my head under the sand. Moreover, all the sex scenes are very cheesy , dramatic and over-written . \u2022 Lucien and (view spoiler) [ Elain\u2019s mating bond (hide spoiler) ] . I swear on my heart I have never, ever read anything more ridiculous than this scene (oh, no, wait: the mountains). The passage from normal, rational person to mad caveman takes less time than a spark to burn. I almost expected he started hissing \u201cMy preciousss\u201d. \u2022And yet, I enjoyed it , or better, I enjoyed Rhys , Rhys , his long, sappy, teary declaration/explanation (I have a thing for this trope; it could have been a thousand times worse than it actually is, and still I would've loved it. I am such a softie, I know. My fault), the ending , and Rhys . The other things I pretty much despised. I also appreciate the fact that at least the author tried \u2013and at some length, I think, even succeeded a tiny bit- to conceive a scenario in which Rhys\u2019s cuddliness actually makes some sense. I still prefer him wicked. \u27bd To sum it up, what can I say? I read it with with ease because of an extremely fluent, even though not particularly sophisticated, writing style, and, as we all know, idiocies and mushy stuff can also be enjoyable, and truly, this book take the concept of guilty pleasure to a whole new level. Nonetheless, I am sorry, but I can't overcome the irritation that Maas's little games cause in me. She used the same lame and unprofessional trick twice now; my trust in her is gone, and I'm wondering if we should expect a third time too. EDIT 29/03/16: Ok, so I read the excerpt -as usual, unforgivably late, but this time the delay is due to the fact that I didn't know whether to read it or not. If you want to join the club, you can find it here . What do I think of it? I simply think that making a protagonist go OOC with three plain lines does take an inconceivable amount of talent. Because apparently the whole Queen of Shadows mess wasn't enough. Respect, Maas. Really.

But it's all hotness if you stretch the age gap from decades to centuries? -Sex scenes were laughable AND cringeworthy. I call this erotica for children. Don't look at me, I'm not the one who wrote it. -The writing was monotonous. I don't even want to think about this. -Plot... was there any? Whatever it was, i found it painfully predictable. If you've read ToG series, that's all it is with just different hair/eye colors. I am seriously baffled how others aren't seeing this. -If i didn't know any better i'd call this ToG, Twilight, and Shatter Me rip off. Considering how absurd those books are themselves, this says a lot. -Surely I can't be the only one who finds the term \"mate\" utterly ridiculous. I was dying laughing every time it was mentioned. Just couldn't take it seriously. Sorry, not sorry. There also seems to be a new trend in SJM's book. I wonder what goes on in her head. I bet something like this: hum my snowflake already have 12 love interests, how can I possibly add another to this never ending list? Oh, there is a clever idea! If he is her \"mate\" no one will dare question me. *pats her own back* I really am a genius! -I called all of those \"shocking\" twists before the book was even out. Deep down i was hoping this would prove me wrong, but sadly i remain right. This is the most overrated piece of crap i've ever attempted to read. I mean do people really find this appealing? Oh, well, i tried. But there is a good news!! This book was a gift which means i didn't spend a penny on this, but my local bookstore is willing to trade this for Gemina .

Yeah, classic wrong thing for the right reasons, but you can justify Tamlin's behavior with the same theory. I love them as individuals, and as long as they love each other and make each other happy, I ship it. I ship it to the ends of the earth. \"You think I don't know how stories get written\u2014how this story will be written?\" Rhys put his hands on his chest, his face more open, more anguished than I'd ever seen it. \"I am the dark lord, who stole the bride of spring. I am a demon, and a nightmare, and I will meet a bad end. He is the golden Prince\u2014the hero who will get to keep you as his reward for not dying of stupidity and arrogance.\" Fine, maybe I ship it little. So I mentioned Tamlin. Tamlin, who Feyre and us readers (mostly) loved in A Court of Thorns and Roses . Tamlin, who is an abusive aggressor in A Court of Mist & Fury. \"He never woke when the nightmares dragged me from sleep; never woke when I vomited my guts up night after night. If he knew or heard, he said nothing about it.\" The complexity of Feyre and Tamlin's relationship takes my breath away. I love the first book even more because of the Easter eggs Maas hid in their initial courtship. He'd always been borderline Christian Grey and some readers picked up on it. I didn't though. I was as caught up in the magic and wonder as Feyre was and just as blindsided when Tamlin got more and more controlling. I sympathized with Tamlin sometimes. That's how good Maas is. Abusive relationships aren't black and white. They begin with love, searing, consuming love, until it burns. \"I had loved the High Lord who had shown me the comforts and wonders of Prythian; I had loved the High Lord who let me have time and food and safety to paint. Maybe a small part of me might always care for him, but... Armarantha had broken us both. Or broken me so that who he was and what I now was no longer fit.\" I was worried about the love triangle and I needn't have. It's not about a girl choosing between two guys. It's about a woman growing and learning and finding out what she wanted in the past may not be right for her now. It's a feminist masterpiece and it's beautiful. \"You might be my mate,\" he said, \"but you remain your own person. You decide your fate\u2014your choices. Not me. You chose yesterday. You choose every day. Forever.\" BE STILL, MY HEART. My review of A Court of Thorns & Roses Update 6/5/2016: It's out! And I'm too busy with school to read it.

Then ACOMAF was released and there was an outcry of dismay by the bookish equivalent of the general public, which, of course , made me think . . . Hmm . . .? B/c in a handful of ways, I'm not unlike Feyre myself---DIFFICULT. And if everyone hates something, especially, when they previously loved it (and I did not ), there's a distinct possibility that I will love it. #thestruggleisreal At first, I'll admit, I wasn't impressed. The prologue and the first few chapters were all blah, blah, self-loathing, blah, do-as-I'm-told, something, something, stifle-my-feelings-b/c-Tamlin-has-his-own-issues, blah, blah, Stepford Wife, something, throwing-a-shoe-at-Rhysand's-head . . . Aha . . . There she is . . . And suddenly my assumption that Maas had done, once again, what a lot of people think she did in ToG, b/c fickle-broad-who-couldn't-make-her-mind-up-about-Celaena's HEA, seemed a bit hasty. WARNING: if you're a new-to-SJM reader and have no idea what I've been talking about thus far, STOP. My vaguery is about to get less vague. I'll spoiler tag any blatant spoilers, but a lot of this review is my answer to all the other reviews saying Maas arbitrarily made a significant change in the direction the series was heading. If you don't know what I'm talking about, and don't want to be potentially spoiled about that change, DO NOT READ PAST THIS POINT. You have been duly warned. Right. So after the first section (114 of 624 pages), Feyre finally became a character I could admire, and she did it in such a way that her actions in the early part of the book were realistic. And the further I got into the book, the more obvious it was that, NO, this was not a last minute decision on SJM's part. There is sign after sign after still more signs that Maas was heading in this direction from the beginning. If you want a comprehensive spoiler-filled list of things said and done in ACOTAR that point to the fact that someone did NOT arbitrarily become the Bad Guy--he was never the Good Guy in the first place--then check out my girl Anna's review . Smarter than 99% of the rest of us, she never fell for the act in the first place. And let's be honest: (view spoiler) [Feyre was never a Spring Court kind of girl. She's a hunter. She's surly. She's rude. She's violent. She's stubborn. And after what happened Under the Mountain, she's darrrrrk. (hide spoiler) ] Also, no matter how much someone else superficially appeared to be the Bad Guy, what did we really know about him? Not much that wasn't based on someone else's opinion. And what we did know firsthand, was that (view spoiler) [he cared enough about his people to become Amarantha's plaything. That he literally whored himself out to protect his people. And he refused to kill the High Lord of Summer's cousin on her whim, AND he kept Feyre ALIVE. (hide spoiler) ] So there. Take that, naysayers. *winks* I can't say much about the plot without giving things away, but after Feyre turns her corner, what follows is probably my favorite story from Maas yet. Actually, I probably wouldn't tell you anything about the plot even if it wouldn't be spoilery. The world Maas shows us in this book is friggin' riddikulus. You want to experience it with a blank slate, trust me. It doesn't get a full five stars b/c those first hundred pages were rough, and there were also a couple of stretching-the-bounds-of-credulity moments near the end, but, man alive, I almost didn't care. The twists of Feyre's remaking, the new characters, the Illryians--winged Fae warrior men!--the sexual tension . . . Speaking of, that's what the 'beware!' button is for. This is meant to be a YA book, but there is SEX, and if you thought it was hot in ACOTAR, then the scenes, YES, plural, in ACOMAF will make you combust. So if that's not your thing, and you thought you'd be safe b/c YA, now you know otherwise. Personally, I don't have a problem with that, and I say A COURT OF MIST AND FURY by Sarah J. Maas makes suffering through the first installment well worth it. It's rare that a second in series is better than the first, but this is definitely one of those times. Truly guys, so. Much. Better. Pre-review: SO. I know there's been a lot of hullabaloo over this book--I personally have two friends who refused to read it based on whispers and past experience with SJM. And I haven't stalked the bad reviews or DNFs, so I might be overgeneralizing, but after finishing ACOMAF, the conclusions I have reached are: 1. People who got burned by Queen of Shadows ran out of patience ( as is their right ), and/or 2. People take their preferred ships way too seriously. B/c once you got past that little hiccup, and, okay, fine , the first section of the book (p 114) in which Feyre behaves like a ninny, I think ACOMAF might be the best plot Maas has written. Even better than Heir of Fire , which is one of my reigning favorite YA fantasy installments. ALSO, I believe this book played out the way Maas always intended it to play out. I'll admit, I was quick to jump on the sjm-is-a-fickle-broad-who-can't-make-up-her-mind-about-her-character's-ships when I first started hearing rumbles about ACOMAF. BUT. That was before I had read it, and it was based on what I thought had happened in QoS. After reading it . . . it makes sense. There are definitely clues pointing back to events in ACOTAR that it would happen the way it did. #sorrynotsorry And really, IMO, this way is SO. MUCH. BETTER. Full RTC.

She's mine. --- \u201cYou're mine.\u201d --- \u201cI never knew why.\u201d \u201cI wonder if some part of me knew what was waiting for me. - I wonder if, even in my despair and hopelessness, I was never truly alone. ... \"I began to have these ... dreams. At first, they were glimpses, as if I were staring through someone else's eyes. A crackling hearth in a dark room. A bale of hay in a barn.\u201d \u201cI thought nothing of them, until one of the images was of a hand ... this beautiful, human hand. Holding a brush. Painting- flowers on a table.\u201d - - - - - - \u201cI started speaking without knowing what I was saying, only that you were there..\u201d - - - - - - \u201cThen I learned your name. Hearing you say it...it was like an answer to a question I'd been asking for five hundred years. I decided, then and there, that I was going to fight.\u201d ... \u201cIf you were going to die, I was going to die with you.\u201d \u201cI tugged, I willed you to hold on, to stay with me.\u201d ... And I wondered if love was too weak a word for what he felt, what he'd done for me. For what I felt for him. \u201cAnd now I want you to know, that I love you. I want you to know ... I want you to know, that I am broken and healing, \u201cI love you. ... For the first time in decades, I wanted to laugh. I would have a future. A life. *** I didn't include all quotes due to extreme spoilers, but I thought these ones were nice. Also, this took me even longer to create the second time around since I binge watched a thousand multicouple edits in order to create gifs and quotes. I'm proud of how it turned out, though. P.S. I'm doing Pynch next. Hope you enjoyed! these songs/artists are stunning, and fit perfectly emotion wise Natalie Taylor- Come To This Amy Stroup-Dark Runs Out (absolute favourite when it came to the couple) Gin Wigmore - I Will Love You (The lyrics alone can make a person cry) Cloves - Don't You Wait Neulore- Don't Shy From The Light ...more I am so surprised that I genuinely enjoyed this, genuinely was invested in the story and characters. I read Throne of Glass and didn't like it. I read A Court of Thorns and Roses and thought it was mediocre. But after reading ACOMAF, I *finally* get the SJM hype. Please no love triangle.

I'll be honest, I never fully bought the Tamlin/Feyre line up, even before Rhys, so for me I wasn't completely won over until Under the Mountain happened. (Amarantha is a fav villain of mine now).

So glad all that happened that I thought was not important tied into this one. Feyre : Ok girl. I'm glad you are starting to grow a spine. I know you went through a lot being poor and starving, but sometimes I wanted to slap you in the Spring Court. I'm amazed at how quickly I was ready to abandon everything you knew there once Rhys entered the picture (JK not really because Tamlin's no good), but I'm glad things got turned upside down. I think your ending in this book was perfect; so glad to see you where you belong, doing what you want to be doing, as an equal and not a pet. Tamlin : Alrighty you... I'm not your biggest fan. I hate your guts and hope you get a swift kick in the balls asap. However, I think the author has set you up to redeem yourself in ACOWAR if you so choose. You are also really dumb and seem to see none of the things going on around you. Stop being a tool. Also, I'm fairly certain I wondered for 2 entire books what purpose you serve, but I see how the meat of this story wouldn't exist without your setting up all the parts we love. So thank you for that. And grow your hair back out. Man bun it up please. Rhys ILY ILY ILY ILY ILY. Perfection; every bit of how she wrote you in was perfection. Every tiny detail that went back to connect other details from page 1 in ACOTAR was mind blowing. You have the best ideas and I'm sorry it took Feyre so long to see that. Thanks for being so sexy and wonderful. And for not being a tool like Tam Tam. Lucien : You're dead to me prick. Ok not really, but I'm mad at you and you have to win me back over in book #3. And please more of you and Elain. Mor, Amren, Cassian, Az : Love you all and thanks for being the best gang around. Can't wait to catch up in May. More Nesta/Cassian and Mor/Az please. Also, all the newborn fae is a little much and I'm still not convinced in the necessity of all that. Maybe Amren and Tam Tam the brute? I'm feeling it. Alis(sp?) : Miss you boo. Hope all is well and we see you in #3. Original Post: Well.... I don't even have the words right now, but I have no idea how to start another book until my hangover from this one disappears. SO much better than ACOTAR! Still die hard Rhys fangirl. I should stop asking myself if it's possible to hate Tamlin anymore, because somehow it keeps happening. I'm giving Lucien the silent treatment right now. I'll say, I was expecting some big cliffhanger of an ending from reading other's reviews before I started this, and while it did set up perfectly and leave it wide open for ACOWAR, I loved the ending! Yes it ripped my heart apart and ruined me a bit, but I thought it was genius. Going to process a bit more before a full review, but in the meantime will try to figure out what to do with myself until May. ...more<---C>Sarah J.
