I highly recommend this book to everyone on the planet today. This book along with many other books can be downloaded for FREE at www.harunyahya.com \"All that we have seen in this work shows us one clear fact: The Qur'an, this extraordinary book which was revealed to the Seal of the Prophets, Muhammad (saas), is a source of inspiration and true knowledge. The book of Islam-no matter what subject it refers to-is being proved as Allah's word as each new piece of historical, scientific or archaeological information comes to light. Facts about scientific subjects and the news delivered to us about the past and future, facts that no one could have known at the time of the Qur'an's revelation, are announced in its verses. It is impossible for this information, examples of which we have discussed in detail in this book, to have been known with the level of knowledge and technology available in 7th century Arabia. With this in mind, let us ask: Could anyone in 7th century Arabia have known that our atmosphere is made up of seven layers? Could anyone in 7th century Arabia have known in detail the various stages of development from which an embryo grows into a baby and then enters the world from inside his mother? Could anyone in 7th century Arabia have known that the universe is \"steadily expanding,\" as the Qur'an puts it, when modern scientists have only in recent decades put forward the idea of the \"Big Bang\"? Could anyone in 7th century Arabia have known about the fact that each individual's fingertips are absolutely unique, when we have only discovered this fact recently, using modern technology and modern scientific equipment? Could anyone in 7th century Arabia have known about the role of one of Pharaoh's most prominent aids, Haman, when the details of hieroglyphic translation were only discovered two centuries ago? Could anyone in 7th century Arabia have known that the word \"Pharaoh\" was only used from the 14th century B.C. and not before, as the Old Testament erroneously claims? Could anyone in 7th century Arabia have known about Ubar and Iram's Pillars, which were only discovered in recent decades via the use of NASA satellite photographs? The only answer to these questions is as follows: the Qur'an is the word of the Almighty Allah, the Originator of everything and the One Who encompasses everything with His knowledge. In one verse, Allah says, \"If it had been from other than Allah, they would have found many inconsistencies in it.\" (Qur'an, 4:82) Every piece of information the Qur'an contains reveals the secret miracles of this divine book. The human being is meant to hold fast to this Divine Book revealed by Allah and to receive it with an open heart as his one and only guide in life. In the Qur'an, Allah tells us the following: This Qur'an could never have been devised by any besides Allah. Rather it is confirmation of what came before it and an elucidation of the Book which contains no doubt from the Lord of all the worlds. Do they say, \"He has invented it\"? Say: \"Then produce a sura like it and call on anyone you can besides Allah if you are telling the truth.\" (Qur'an, 10:37-38) \"And this is a Book We have sent down and blessed, so follow it and have fear of Allah so that hopefully you will gain mercy.<---F> (Qur'an, 6:155)\u201d </---F>...more Religious propaganda at its worst. Not recommended for anyone other than those who prefer a fantasy based life, rather than reality.<---A>Harun Yahya</---A><---C>Harun Yahya</---C><+++>Allah's Miracles in the Qur'an</+++>", "Title": "Allah's Miracles in the Qur'an"},
