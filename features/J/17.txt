For me it was a bit wild, which I like, from a book, but also a little cold, a little impersonal. This book may have issues with nymphomania. It's definately ready and willing to give you a thrill, but even though you've spent some time with it, it still doesn't quite love you back. Sometimes I like a quickie on the T, or during my lunch break, but I really want to feel like the book loves me back. This relationship was fun, but I just don't feel like the commitment was really there. Don't get me wrong; I like this book, but in several of the stories I felt as though the strangeness was there to be strange, and that's not enough for me. I think the best surrealists and fantasy writers can tap easily into strange, but even the cryptic moments come together for cohesive delight. One story in this collection is not to be missed. In \"Vanishing Act\" the strangeness is more subtle, and the magic totally feasible. The characters feel the most real, the most lovingly conceived, and I, the reader, love it without reservation for its uncanny mixture of tragedy and hope. This is a first collection, maybe the second collection will still have that spontaneity I love, but with a little more of the maturity I crave.<---F> From books</---F>. ...more I sort of feel I should apologize for this rating.

I almost put the book down there but I thought, no give it a chance. To Me...let me emphasize that again \"To Me\" the next story and \"the father's nose collection\" were just as silly. It was like a book of television episode outlines, something that might have been seen on the old \"Night Gallery\" series. Okay sorry, if you enjoy this please continue to enjoy. If I want weird tales I'll go back to H.P. Lovecraft and the like. I just found this one not for me. I almost went with one star...but I didn't actually hate it. I just didn't find it worth the time to read. Sorry I see a lot of you like or even love this collection, not me however. ...more I really love <---A>Kelly Link</---A>'s writing style. It falls somewhere between magical realist and full-blown surreal, and it manages to be very emotionally affecting without sacrificing subtlety.

Link can get me to agree to suspend my disbelief in some of the most wildly imaginative and implausible situations, and she has a real knack for being gently disturbing. However, I am only giving this collection, Link's earliest, (which focuses largely on referenced, re-imagined, and re-arranged fairy tales, myths, and legends) 3 stars, because 3.5 isn't an option, and I loved her collection Magic for Beginners considerably more. (It was simply stellar.) These stories are worth the reader's time, and some are downright brilliant. But some left me neutral, and the overall feeling I was left with was one less bowled-over than when I'd finished Magic For Beginners. My recommendation: If you've never read Kelly Link, start with Magic for Beginners , as it was wonderful and whimsical and weird and freaky and creepy across the board. Then, if you enjoy that, explore her earlier work in this collection, <+++>Stranger Things Happen</+++>. ...more Short Stories. This was stamped \"science fiction\" by the library, but these short, fantastic stories have more in common with magical realism and retold fairy tales than science- or even speculative fiction. Plenty of ghosts, being dead, being haunted, dating a son of Zeus, searching for the lover that the Snow Queen stole away -- that sort of thing. Written with a light hand, these stories are bittersweet, spooky, absurd, crazy, and freeing. Each one is perfectly self-contained, but taken toget Short Stories.

Each one is perfectly self-contained, but taken together it's easy to see hints of a bigger world, tiny details that make you think everything might be related, so the book on the whole feels nicely tied together. Link even writes in such experimental forms as second person and present tense, which is not something you see very often in published fiction. She treats the fantastic like it's ordinary, and the ordinary like it might be something secretly fantastic, and I loved every moment of it. Five stars. Link writes great short stories. And I say this as someone who does not generally enjoy a short story. But these I'm going to read again and again. ...more This is a collection of urban fantasy stories with weird twists - and I do mean weird.

Flying Lessons \"Going to hell, instructions and advice...\" Fractured and reconstructed, a modern myth that follows a kleptomaniac innkeeper's daughter (well, actually, it's a British bed & breakfast catering to the tourist trade...) Weird connections, and more than a hint of Eurydice... Travels with the Snow Queen An adult retelling of Hans Christian Andersen's tale. Here, Link reimagines Gerda and Kay not as innocent children but as two contemporary adults in a dysfunctional relationship. A strong feminist message is the main takeaway, as Link turns the original story on its head. Vanishing Act Hildy has always envied her cousin, Jenny Rose, who gets to travel around the world with her missionary parents. But after Jenny Rose is sent to live with them, her feelings change. Jenny Rose is quiet, uncommunicative - the reader can tell, traumatized - but we see things only from the child Hildy's perspective. But Hildy is more perceptive than any of those around her, who gradually seem to stop noticing Jenny Rose at all...

But her wheelhouse is the short story, and this is no country for short story writers. Still, she has her own cult following of devoted fans, and their passionate recommendations drove me to picking up this collection. I liked this collection a lot. There are a few duds, as in most short story collections, but even the duds have something interesting going on. For example, the first story, \"Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose\", didn't grab me as others, but I still found her description of a dead man writing letters to his estranged wife, which he puts in a post box that empties into the sea, to be quite evocative. Reading Link's stories is liberating. They are comfortable in their strangeness. There are no obsessive attempts to \"world build\" or explain how or why things are happening. They have dream logic: things happen because they are happening, and the goal is to go allow with the narrative and enjoy the sights. The writing is very good. It is dreamy, but tightly controlled. In Lousie's Ghost, which features two protagonists of the same name, Link alternates between clearly differentiating between the two Louises and blurring them together, which mirrors their independent personalities and codependent friendship. What I really liked about the collection is that while the stories are detached from reality, they are not so light that they float away. They are tethered to the earth with a strange, precise personalness. Link doesn't give you the impression that she is writing weird stuff to be weird, but just because when she opens her mouth to tell a story, it comes out this way. Under all the strangness, there is a realness that resonates with readers. You may not have a frigging clue what is happening in a story, but you still feel pain, sadness, love, joy, fear, etc. An incredible accomplishment on Link's part. My favorites were the very scary \"The Specialist's Hat\" & the feminist fairy tale \"Travels with the Snow Queen.\" ...more 2.5 stars. I was tempted to give this three stars, because a lot of my reaction wasn't that these stories were bad, just that they weren't for me. But boy, were they not for me.

So I was excited to read her two adult collections, this and Magic for Beginners . I started with this, her earlier collection, and proceeded to be extremely disappointed. For the most part, these stories reminded me unpleasantly of my least favorite literature classes in college, the ones where all the pretentious English majors would say things like, \"I loved how the diamond motif perfectly reflected the unyielding nature of the protagonist's attitude toward motherhood,\" and I would be all, \"Uhh, I liked the bit with the dog. It was funny and sad at the same time, which is, you know, cool.\" Which is to say, these stories weren't fun to read. They were work, full of clever symbolism and literary styling, but not entertaining. And most of the time I felt like the stories were going right over my head, which is a pretty depressing reading experience. There were a few stories I thought were okay, and one, \"Vanishing Act,\" that I really liked a lot, but overall, I'll leave this one to the pretentious English majors.

Within it are eleven exquisitely crafted short stories which range from weird to the truly bizarre. It is difficult to categorize Link's writing, as it seems to straddle science fiction and fantasy, narrative and fiction, real and unreal. \"The Specialist's Hat\" is really one of the spookiest stories I have ever read.

Within it are eleven exquisitely crafted short stories which range from weird to the truly bizarre. It is difficult to categorize Link's writing, as it seems to straddle science fiction and fantasy, narrative and fiction, real and unreal. \"The Specialist's Hat\" is really one of the spookiest stories I have ever read. It is loosely written (as are many of the stories), which - rather than impeding the text - makes it easier to adapt. Her writing seems to permeate right into one's head, letting the reader formulate each story by themselves while being gently urged on by Link. She guides, but does not dictate, the reader. As a result, one makes each story one's own: This compounds how generally creepy her writing is. The stories are also punctuated with truly odd characters. In \"Water off a Black Dog's Back,\" the boy's girlfriend's father is a bizarre character. He is lacking a nose, and therefore replaces it with a prosthesis according to circumstance -- sometimes a wooden one, sometimes a steel one. Link again keeps her writing somewhat vague, but defined enough to paint a rather striking - and oddly frightening - picture of rural life under her twisted pen. The fact that this is Link's first book shows, however. While her writing is strong (she shows remarkable talent), there are immature aspects to it, as well. Her stories can be somewhat \"plotless\" - they are more like literary sketches of disturbing scenarios. Although, this is also what renders her writing so captivating: She makes a story out of some strange event. She does not present a problem to be solved, a climax, a resolution. It's almost as if she leaves that to the reader, choosing instead to lay the groundwork for one's mind to grind away at -- as a reader, we torment ourselves thinking more of what Link has written than what is actually on the page. Kudos to Link for her uncanny ability to turn the familiar into the frightening. Her writing conveys a sense of uneasiness, she manages to make the most normal circumstances into the most disturbing. She is an excellent, captivating writer. ...more I picked up this book because Amazon told me I would like it. Being that I trust their algorithm more than I trust most of my family members, I did it. Kelly Link's collection of short stories ran the gamut between being successful and kind of pointless.

While the concept is interesting: take folktales, fairy tales, ghost stories, etc. and smush with contemporary narrators or situations. Hijinks and fun imagery ensue. The stories I found to be the most successful were those that had a more distinctive plot or took a quirky point of view toward death and evil (boy dates half daughter of Zeus who is persecuted by Hera, ghosts that like to live in cellos, girl who cases ex boyfriend to regain him from snow queen, dictators mummified wife talks about her shoes). The least successful stories worked too hard to hint at some grander mystery or plot convergence but ended up being incoherent or incomplete. Maybe this is because I'm a lazy reader. Maybe because I was exhausted when I read this. Maybe because I don't equate being vague with being insightful. Ultimately, it's an entertaining read but nothing earth shattering or thought provoking beyond idle curiosity. ...more I'm afraid there's a sameness to Link's writing. Grotesquerie, quirky refusal of all resolution. It's a delight for one story (especially when you encounter it somewhere like F&SF, surrounded by the trite and self-serious) but in a collection it quickly becomes annoying. Favorite stories: \"The Specialist's Hat,\" \"The Girl Detective.\" Good, but I loved Get in Trouble much more. Will try Magic for Beginners next to try to recapture that earlier buzz from great and weird stories. I'm a big fan of Kelly Link. She's beyond imaginative, a unique and very talented writer, and I feel, sometimes, as though the essence of my writing and hers isn't that much different. I absolutely loved her second collection, Magic for Beginners , and although I liked some of the stories in Stranger Things Happen , as a whole it didn't have the same sort of impact that other book had for me. I particularly loved \"Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose,\" \"Flying Lessons,\" \"Vanishing Act\" and \"Survivors' Ball, I'm a big fan of Kelly Link.

I absolutely loved her second collection, Magic for Beginners , and although I liked some of the stories in Stranger Things Happen , as a whole it didn't have the same sort of impact that other book had for me. I particularly loved \"Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose,\" \"Flying Lessons,\" \"Vanishing Act\" and \"Survivors' Ball, or, The Donner Party.\" But some of the others fell short to me. And even some of the stories I rather enjoyed had some of the same pitfalls I noticed in Link's other stories when I first read Magic . One such pitfall is Link's inability -- or refusal -- to wrap up most of her pieces. Not to say that everything should be neat and tidy with no loose ends, nor should everything work out perfectly and be completely comprehensible, because, as Link is clearly trying to show us, life isn't that way. And if stories are meant to echo life, they can't be that way either. In some of Link's stories -- and in fact in a lot of them, particularly in this collection -- it's very hard to grasp the essence of the plot or of the story she is trying to tell. And although I don't believe endings should be neat, I do think that the reader should be left with questions -- not gaps in understanding. And sometimes, here, I felt that I simply wasn't able to find the connective tissue or the point hidden underneath all those lovely words and brilliant ideas. I think sometimes, whether or not this is the truth or the way it's conveyed to the reader, Link's ideas are great but not quite complete. Half-baked. In the best way, possible, of course. I think some of her stories are novels and novellas yearning for expansion, and others are in need of pruning. Some of her stories are delightfully odd, some of them are bafflingly bizarre. But I enjoy them. I get a feel for her characters, except when she deliberately makes things too confusing, like in \"Louise's Ghost\" or \"The Girl Detective.\" I think if Magic for Beginners was fabulous for me, this book, her first book, was the work of an unpolished artist who hadn't yet learned that there is a difference between keeping a mystery and an air of wonder about a story and deliberately withholding information that could help clarify the end result. But more often than not, you get the point. There's a feminist angle, a whole lot of fantastical elements that are meant to be enjoyed as much as they are to inform about some aspect of society or life. I love Link. I really do. And I recommend her to anyone who thinks fantasy is stale. But I don't know if I would recommend this particular collection in whole. Magic is my go-to, and it will remain that way. ...more Kelly Link is a little...bizarre. Well, more than a little bizarre. Halfway through the first story (Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose), I realized that I was in for a weird ride. At the time, I was a bit uncertain as to whether or not I wanted to be on a weird ride, but in the end, things were mostly good. A couple of stories ran on (hence three stars rather than four), but on the whole Link has created a great collection.

I like Kelly Link best, when she's giving us the world we know, and steering it slightly, sometimes VERY subtly, off the road and into the fantastic. ...more My interest came from this article on stories that scare the hell out of authors , in which Joe Hill pointed to the story The Specialist's Hat (available to read for free) . I read the Specialist's Hat first, but then went on to the rest of the stories. The whole thing is free as an ebook on Goodreads.

There were a few that I quite fancied (the Snow Queen one, in particular) but the ones that left me scratching my head outnumbered them. I recommend you give it a try, especially considering it's published free under a Creative Commons License. Someone more sophisticated than me would probably appreciate it more. Unabashedly girly, experimental, tender, genius. It took a few stories for me to get into Link but I think... I think I love her like I love Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and four day old tres leches cake with black coffee, all things sweet and sneaky and spooky. I saw this book, slightly water-damaged and gently battered, sitting in a shelf in my favorite thrift shop in Cambridge, and, reader, I wasted no time in taking this book home (despite the fact that I have no bookshelves and really shouldn't be buying books at all).

I am indebted to Kelly Link, see, for having saved me with her collection of stories from Magic for Beginners last year, which I read to escape my life at a time when things were Not Going Well. By all rights, I shouldn't like Link's work that much - I have expressed my dislike of magical realism more than once, and short stories haven't traditionally been my thing. I should, perhaps, rethink both of those statements, because change is good, and because Kelly Link's work is so captivating. Even when there are stories that don't compel me, Link's imagery and wordplay pull me right in. This isn't a collection I would recommend to just anyone, and it's a collection I'd understand if people dislike, but this is nonetheless a book I am greatly pleased to own. \"Flying Lessons\" absolutely blew me out of the water, and \"Travels with the Snow Queen\" and \"The Girl Detective\" were also lovely to read. ...more I do not know very much about short fiction. I tend to read novels and nonfiction, and I'll just occasionally dip into short stories: I've read a bit of Borges and Calvino, and some anthologies way back in the day.

They're immediately striking - Link is a master of atmosphere and tone - and it's interesting to see, as you work your way further and further into the story, how that tone intensifies, dissipates, or shifts. I was very impressed by Link's stories, though I didn't always like them. They're dreamy. I'm sure that's an overused adjective in relation to her work, but I think it's apt - the writing is light, the logic is smeared, and things almost never feel as if they're tethered to the ground. There are lots of ghosts that live in cellos, beauty pageant contestants that can raise the dead, and men and women who flutter their way through modern-day fairy tales. I think the dream-like quality accounts for the best and worst aspects of Link's work. The sense of imagination and atmosphere can be really affecting and there are a couple of stories in here - \"Vanishing Act,\" \"The Specialist's Hat,\" and \"Travels of the Snow Queen\" in particular - that really leave and impact, and do so with minimal fuss. Link's ideas are simply presented and they stand on their own, and they're usually strong enough that this minimalist presentation only makes them more interesting or affecting. When details or descriptions do pop up, then, they're striking. But at the same time, the dream-like quality of the stories in this collection can often make them seem cold, aloof, and detached. My favorite story, by far, was \"Vanishing Act,\" and it's also the only story told by someone not personally experiencing the magical or the supernatural (instead, she's watching someone else experience it). This tether to reality does wonders for Link's story, because it makes the magical seem more magical, and the whole reality of the story seem more important. The dream logic that permeates the rest of the collection tends to dampen the emotional reality of the people within it so they all seem to be floating around, dream people in a dream world. It's interesting, and its atmospheric, but it can be very hard to be moved by it. I wish there was more spillover between the mundane and the fantastic in the emotional lives of the characters as well, because by the end nearly all of them felt like symbols more than people. And that's not the worst thing in the world, of course. Most of the stories are not aiming for that, and it's probably unfair of me to criticize them for failing to do something they were never aiming for in the first place. Read in isolation, I think nearly all of these stories would be very interesting and enjoyable. But altogether in a collection they can become a little tiring and same-y, and it sometimes feels like other important storytelling aspects as sacrificed for the sake of atmosphere. ...more Stranger Things Happen is an eerie, ghostly collection of stories by Kelly Link. The stories range from magical realism to the other wordly. My favourite stories from this collection are Travels With The Snow Queen, Vanishing Act, Water Off A Black Dog's Back, The Girl Detective and Survivor's Ball.

I've always imagined if my pets could talk they would call me out and speak awful truths. I loved the letter she penned to her ex boyfriend about why he dumped her. Water Off a Black Dog's back was desolate with the question of choosing water or love. I love how she wove that question throughout the story. I feel Rachel's mother was causing her bad luck in the end to push poor Carroll away. The box with the dogs painted on them with red teeth was quite vivid imagery and when they ate his finger off. Most of My Friend's Are Two-Thirds Water crept under my skin due to Jak's obession with blondes that resemble Sandy Duncan. My mother never dicussed my father very often but I did know he loathed Sandy Duncan. I felt a bit of a connection with him due to my shared dislike of that actress. I had to sit through her godawful performance of Peter Pan as a child and loathed ever since. I adore Peter Pan but not Sandy Duncan. Vanishing Act was adorable and made magical realism work in a way Paul Auster could never quite manage for me. It reminded me of an old episode of Nickelodeon's \"Are You Afraid of the Dark?\" where the dorky cousin is forced to stay with the 90s-cool but so awkwardly dorky by today's standard bully but turned on its head. We only think we know where this story was headed. I felt alternating disgust and pity for poor Jennie Rose just as Hildy did. Her older brother James plight of not wanting to draft and smoking pot was pathetic and sad. He was such a teenager the way young kids view their siblings. Kelly Link always gets each character so right. ...more<---C>Kelly Link</---C>", "Title": "Stranger Things Happen"},
