OK, I admit that I am grossly trivialising a tremendous story, which is really about Marcus Attilius Primus, the aquarius, or chief water engineer, who is sent to the Bay of Naples to manage the water supply to all of the towns in the area. The main artery of the supply is the aqueduct, Aqua Augusta, which Attilius's grandfather may have had a hand in building under the supervision of the great Agrippa. Water engineering has been the career path of Atillius's family back through at least four generations. From the off, Attilius is up against it. His predecessor disappeared mysteriously, and neither his team of engineers and slaves nor those masters who govern Naples and the surrounding area, are inclined to trust the new aquarius. The first chapter opens with the horrendous execution of a slave who has been held responsible for the deaths of one of the local lord's prize fish. The lord's daughter, accompanied by the unfortunate slave's mother, urgently seek the help of Attilius, who quickly discovers that it is something in the water which has killer the precious fish. But they are too late to save the wretched slave. Events unfold and develop during the two days leading up to the famous eruption which buried <+++>Pompeii</+++>. This is a rivetting read, if ever there was one. As you would expect, there are many dangers to overcome, and, as you read, you will be wondering who will survive and who will not. This does not become clear until the final pages. I have to confess that I was wishing for the demise of certain characters, whilst hoping for the survival of others. That is a sign of how well <---A>Robert</---A> Harris engages the reader with the actors in this story.<---F> Definitely merits five stars</---F>. ...more Geology meets Volcanology meets All Round Mr Nice Guy.

Many authors try to be story tellers, but they over write or have not the skill and under write, or get caught up in too many tangents, thinking that everything they do has to be with the single intent of delivering the next great International Epic Bestseller. <+++>Pompeii</+++> certainly became an International Bestseller, but it was not really an epic. It was a story of a man - an Aquarius - and was melded with a intriguing blend of geology, volcanology and precise Roman history. Very well done, in my opinion, but no epic. I do not know if the geological and volcanological elements would put others off, whether others may prefer a story about people only, but I happened to find them extraordinarily fascinating. I have a feeling the book was not what some may expect. Where you may have expected a Wilbur Smith type epic - multiple characters and their lives in the lead up to the Mt Vesuvius explosion - that is not what you got. Robert Harris gave you instead, Attilius (<---B>the all round Mr Nice Guy</---B>), an Aquarius who came to the Bay of Naples as a result of the mysterious disappearance of the former Aquarius, Exomnius, and took over the running of the Aqueducts. And for the most part, this is Attilius' story as he finds the water supply in disarray and bit by bit, clue by clue, he starts to unravel the causes. Will it be in time though? Obviously, since everyone knows what happened to Pompeii and Herculaneum, everyone will realise he cannot be in time to do anything about those disasters, but can he be in time to avert others? I found the final third of the book to be the most compelling. The eruption and the various stages of the eruption and how it might be experienced from different places in the surrounding area. In the towns, at the base of the volcano, on the water, in the Bay. I was mesmerised by it all. There was a moment where I thought the book perhaps could have finished and yet it went on. And there was a scene or two that seemed inserted to make the book longer as those scenes kind of tripped up the urgent momentum of the book during the eruption. But I had to give the book 5 stars. It deserved it in my opinion. For despite its flaws, it had me at ave . *nb: ave is a Roman hello. ...more I have been a bit fascinated with the idea of Pompeii since I was a girl and the National Geographic ran photos of the people frozen in mid-flight trying to escape the horrors of the eruption of Vesuvius.

Before the eruption, before the horror, there is a problem with the flow of the water. Attilius seeks to repair the breach in the aqueduct and this leads him to be in Pompeii at exactly the wrong time. I did enjoy reading the story. There was the tension of knowing what was to come and the wish to see Attilius survive the inevitable. I can imagine that much of what people felt and the reactions that came too late were exactly as Harris depicted. However, I could never become truly invested in his characters and I therefore felt very little for their plight. It seemed a bit trite, like a 1970s disaster movie (think Poseidon Adventure), although I do not know what I could have expected him to do with this foregone scenario. Not a bad tale, just not a great one. I would still like to go and see the ruins of Pompeii for myself. It is easy to form a tightness in the chest when one thinks about how horrible this must have been for the actual people who lived there. How hopeless it was in those moments before the cloud of fiery gas spewed down the side of the mountain and froze them in time forever. ...more It should be a Two-For-One: A suspense novel to take to the beach; and some insight into life in the Roman Empire and the eruption of Mt.

He investigates the mysterious failure of the water supply and along the way, discovers that his predecessor was corrupt. He falls in love and is stalked by bad guys who want to shut him off permanently. Meanwhile, Vesuvius prepares to make it all moot. But the characters are caricatures. The hero is REALLY, REALLY NOBLE, the villain is AWFULLY, AWFULLY EVIL, and the love interest is darned good looking. Life in the Empire is similarly exaggerated with lingering attention to the grotesque and decadent but almost nothing about how most people lived. I was relieved when Vesuvius erupted. ...more One knows the end\u2026then you start to read the beginning\u2026.

Attilius is the aquarius \u2013 the water engineer, as his father and grandfather had been before him, for the region surrounding the Bay of Naples, including the thriving city of Pompeii. A straight-up, earnest young man, his moral compass is steadfast and his devotion to his career unwavering. When the Aqua Augusta mysteriously runs dry, an ominous signal that the entire water system might be in jeopardy, he sets about doing what every engineer would do \u2013 methodically investigating the unexplained cause. For not only is there urgency in fixing the problem, there is also the ominous thread of Attilius\u2019 life being at stake. Harris has created a vibrant political, cultural and social setting against which the story is set paving the way for a rich historical fiction that literally runs alongside the geological events, which Attilius starts assessing two days before the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. The other character I really enjoyed was Pliny \u2013 the astute and strategic naval and army commander who was also a scholar, author and philosopher \u2013 what a great mind. Harris\u2019 research is impressive and his writing absorbing. To successfully write an historical fiction about the eruption of a volcano a couple of thousand years ago and make it interesting, exciting and educational, well, that\u2019s quite a feat! A highly recommended read. ...more I recently read classicist Mary Beard's fascinating non-fiction book on Pompeii. This novel by Robert Harris is in many ways a nice complement to that, especially since it is narrated by a Roman engineer responsible for the aqueduct that supplied water to the coastal towns on the Bay of Naples, Pompeii among them.

This novel by Robert Harris is in many ways a nice complement to that, especially since it is narrated by a Roman engineer responsible for the aqueduct that supplied water to the coastal towns on the Bay of Naples, Pompeii among them. We think of the Romans as conquerors, of building a civilization based upon conquest. But Roman engineering was as much, if not more, of a driving force, and the Romans' ability to harness and move water around was one of their special talents. Marcus Atillius sets out from Miseneum, the terminus of the great Aqua Augusta, to find out what has caused the water to become sulfurous, then to stop flowing altogether, in the towns that rely on the aqueduct. He eventually works his way to the source of the problem in the foothills of Mt. Vesuvius. Along the way he encounters a cross-section of Roman characters - senators, slaves, freedmen, citizens, businessmen, even an ex-gladiator. My favorite character is the historical figure, Pliny, the great ancient Roman naturalist and scholar. He had himself rowed out from Miseneum, where he could have observed the disaster in comparative safety, as close as possible to witness and record events as the mountain exploded, drawn by curiosity and a kind of amazing fearlessness. He became trapped and died along the shores of Stabiae and was buried beneath the falling ash and pumice. Like with Pliny's death, we know what will happen next in this book, but Harris still makes it suspenseful. ...more After a day in Pompeii -- my mother claims I walked through every single house: not true, some are inaccessible -- I heard people on the platform of the Circumvesuviana local train talking about this book.

I was being fussy about everything else I was reading, so I grabbed this on the Kindle store and kicked back with it (once we eventually got back to Rome, anyway; I read The Map of Time on the Eurostar). It's a quick read, and reasonably accurate to the interpretations of what happened in Pompeii. Obviously, it invents things, and I don't know nearly enough detail to know exactly what, but what I do know, for example the appearance of the explosion and the details about Pliny, seemed accurate. Obviously, as other people have observed, there can be no suspense about whether Vesuvius will erupt or not -- spoiler: it did, and Pompeii was destroyed; that's just historical fact, like the sinking of the Titanic. But there can be atmosphere, and there are several subplots -- a romance, civic corruption, the work of the engineers on the aqueducts... These are mostly well handled, though I couldn't believe in the love story -- mostly, I felt it was spoilt by the ending, which was a bit too... easy. Still, it's enjoyable and a fast read, and not even too fluffy. The detail and research is there. ...more Think you have pressure at work? Consider Marcus Attilius Primus.

Of course, he does have a very beautiful daughter who appeals to Attilius for help. There\u2019s trouble bubbling up for our hero, and it\u2019s not just political corruption, bribes, missing persons, and bad plumbing. There\u2019s something very strange about the high, flat-topped mountain close to the aqueduct. Odd rumblings, strange gases, and earth tremors have been coming from Vesuvius in the past few days. This is a disaster thriller that will keep you flipping the pages late into the night. Will the hero be able to save the heroine, or will she need to save him, or is everyone going to end up toast in the explosive conclusion? ...more 3  stars I have wanted to read this book for a decade I\u2019ve loved science, and particularly geology, from a very early age, and chose a science class in 5th grade that focused on volcanoes, so my interest is long standing.

I got used the fictional story and it did provide a fairly good backdrop for the setting and happenings in that time and place. There is a very long build up though. At times the story had me rolling my eyes and laughing in places where I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t meant for the reader to laugh, which surprised me given the author. It read very much like a cheesy soap opera at times. Particularly at the end there were things I both loved and hated in the historical fiction story. I was left conflicted about whether to give this book 3 or 4 stars. I suspect that I might be upping it a star because I\u2019m so fascinated with the events, and perhaps it should be the other way around and I should downgrade it. I did like the characters and events that seemed to be based on history, and was touched a few parts at the end, but overall the whole narrative seemed like something I had to get through to find out exactly what happened at Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. I\u2019d already read some accounts so I had an idea of what to expect. For me the story did drag at times, and that shouldn\u2019t happen with this subject matter! For all my complaints, the fictional story was a good vehicle to tell the geological story and its toll on the area and its inhabitants. I was impressed by the Romans\u2019 accomplishments, and learned quite a bit about their culture. Of course, I loved the map (I frequently referred to it) and the description/names of time keeping and calendar in that era Rome, and really appreciated the informative quotes from non-fiction books that are at the beginning of every chapter. I was dismayed that in the last few pages the author\u2019s words/musings has me suspecting that he might be a denier of human caused climate change. I am still eager to read his book Fatherland . ...more Explosive!!! In a little over seven hours, one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-six years ago Mt.

The water engineer heads out amid widespread corruption in Pompeii, thwarts a murder plot, finds out what happened to his predecessor, falls in love, and investigates the ominous rumbling from the nearby Vesuvius. Sounds good no? Harris is good at building up the air of menace in the days preceding the eruption. Every action can be looked at as minor compared to the devastation coming and he really does a great job of creating an atmosphere of anticipation in the reader. He's also done a great job at recreating the feel of living in Roman times, as well as supplying a lot of information on Roman aqueducts giving you a sense of awe and genius for the Roman Empire. Where he falls down though is in the characterisation. Attilius, the engineer, is the hero. He's a stoic, good looking gent who sends his pay home to his mother and sister in Rome. He doesn't take bribes, he's hardworking, and is disliked for his strict attention to detail (all for the good of Rome naturally). He's so perfect in fact that he's boring. But he's not alone. A equally dreary love interest is introduced who meets the engineer no more than 3 times briefly but over the course of those 3 encounters the reader is supposed to buy that they have fallen madly in love and would die for each other. The whole reason for the engineer to rush back to Pompeii after escaping it is because of this love interest and as such everything feels very contrived. It's this lack of convincing that stops the reader in their tracks because there's no real reason, once the eruptions start, to care what the engineer's motivations are. He's a paper thin cardboard cut out and so is his love interest. So what? The third act also falls down. Harris does a great job of setting the scene but once Vesuvius erupts he somehow manages to make it boring. For a thriller to fail in the third act is not a good sign and I could quite easily put the book down and do anything else. It's not a bad novel by any means it just seems trite at times which spoils the overall effect. Harris has obviously done his research, it's just a shame the same effort didn't go into making an interesting enough scenario to take place during this immense natural disaster or characters worth caring about. ...more 4.5 stars.

This is a fascinating account of the build up to the eruption, with each chapter headed by a quote from a scientific journal explaining what was happening inside the mountain. By the final chapters, we were caught in the showers of rock and pumice battering and burying the population. It then took half a minute or less for those who had survived the rock showers to be choked by a cloud of gas and ash that came rolling off the mountain which is why their bodies were entombed in positions of flight and fear.

Just imagine a fountain of rock and ashes that is shot into the sky and several miles high!!!! The (for the most part) fictional story is interesting, imaginable und enthralling to some extend. It's also informative. And of course I had to look up Pompeii on the Internet and my big History Chronicle Book. I wondered why no one (or almost no one) noticed the warnings of Vesus, the reams of little tremors of the earth that happened before the eruption for example... I mean, they did notice the tremors, they just didn't think much about it because they've never seen a volcanic eruption before. Vesuv's last activity had been almost 2000 years before this disaster in 79 A.D., so they simply didn't know what it's like and didn't know that Vesuv actually IS a volcano. But thanks to Plinius (a scientist of that time) we all know today what happened in Pompeii on this hot day in August and what a volcanic eruption can be like. He didn't survive, but his record did and therefore he provided the first account of a natural disaster ever (if we don't count the ones described in the bible). ...more A tremendous book, one of my reads of the year (a difficult thing, considering how many good books I've encountered recently) and one of the finest historicals I've ever read.

Harris turns out to be an eminently readable author who has a way of making dry facts and figures interesting, as the text is interspersed with engaging descriptions that do nothing to slow the breakneck narrative down. The reason that POMPEII is such a good read is that it works without the volcanic eruption - take out Vesuvius entirely and I'd still be thoroughly hooked by the mystery plot. The setting is very well realised - you can smell the heat and taste the decadence of Rome - and the characters, while occupying well-established types, are well drawn. By the time the book gets around to the eruption, I was so gripped that I read the rest in a single sitting - a rare occurrence, as I prefer to savour the stories I particularly enjoy. They're currently producing a miniseries of this, and if it comes close to the quality of the book then it's sure to be a winner. ...more Harris has given us a wonderful version of what it would have been like to go through the eruption of Vesuvius. His main character is an engineer, a water engineer. The engineer is an unassuming character dedicated to his work. We experience the eruption through the eyes of this engineer and because of this point of view, the story takes on more meaning and immediacy. It is this point of view that really makes the story for me. It's obvious that Harris has done his research.

But it is now a city that is much more alive for me than ever before. I would definitely recommend this book to those who love historical fiction and also to those who love a good story. ...more Ever since I did an essay on Pompeii last year for uni and enjoyed a YA novel called Curses and Smoke, I've been wanting to read more novels about Pompeii. I thought this would be a great one and maybe it is, but I just don't care for it. If anything, it was sending me to sleep. Oh well! I only paid a few dollars for my copy.

Dennoch geht Harris einen sehr interessanten Weg und l\u00e4sst eine Handlung entstehen, in der zun\u00e4chst der Ausbruch des Vulkans nur in Vorzeichen angedeutet wird.

An Nebenschaupl\u00e4tzen werden die Lebensgewohnheiten der damaligen Zeit hervorragend dargestellt - Harris l\u00e4sst das erste nachchristliche Jahrhundert wieder auferstehen. Und nat\u00fcrlich kommt auch eine Liebesgeschichte nicht zu kurz. Sehr sch\u00f6n fand ich auch den Schluss, der sich die bef\u00fcrchtete Kitschszene ersparte. Auch sprachlich ist Harris ein wirklich hervorstechendes Werk gelungen, seine S\u00e4tze haben die Kraft des ausbrechenden Vulkans. Ebenso ist das Werk stilistisch sehr gut gearbeitet, so setzt Harris Vor- und R\u00fcckblenden sehr geschickt ein um der Geschichte den n\u00f6tigen Pepp zu verleihen. Nebenbei spinnt er auch noch eine Geschichte um das Thema Korruption ein, die f\u00fcr Spannung sorgt. Interessant sind die vor jedem Kapitel angef\u00fchrten Fakten und Zitate zu Vulkanen, die dem ganzen Werk eine weitere Aufwertung geben, denn um dem Genre des historischen Romans treu zu bleiben erlaubt sich Harris keine Anachronismen, und so muss er moderne Beschreibungen vom Text abtrennen. Die Charaktere sind sehr gut beschrieben und glaubw\u00fcrdig dargestellt. Trotz des zwangsl\u00e4ufig am \u00e4u\u00dferen Geschehen orientierten Handlungsverlaufes, macht sich Harris die M\u00fche seinen Personen Charakter, Tiefe und Glaubw\u00fcrdigkeit zu verleihen, eine zweifellos wertvolle Herangehensweise an das Thema. Es gibt keine nennenswerten Ausrutscher oder Schw\u00e4chen, weshalb man das Buch nur uneingeschr\u00e4nkt empfehlen kann - vorausgesetzt der geneigte Leser erwartet sich nicht Action pur. ...more My girlfriend's drunken \"aunt\" insisted I read this book, and apparently she has good taste.

It's an interesting mix of pulp, disaster, apocalyptic and historical fiction. The writing is clear, the pacing brisk and the characters are immediately identifiable as separate individuals despite their unwieldy name-chains. The excerpts from modern scientific discourses on vulcanology which open each chapter, coupled with the quotations from classical authors in the body of the text, help ground the narrative in reality and contextualize everything that happens in the narrative. The author deserves a special literary award for the way in which he presents various characters' attempts to understand the natural phenomena which are occurring around them -- he clearly understands that people in the past were not idiots and that our modern scientific knowledge is the product of millennia of individual and cultural contributions. Thus, when Pliny (yes, THAT Pliny) suggests that the earthquakes they are experiencing are the result of the celestial spheres vibrating in disharmony, he is not presented as a superstitious, ignorant clod for modern readers to chuckle over. Harris does not make the beliefs and \"science\" of the era seem absurd nor does he make the characters who hold to them seem excessively credulous (an all-too-common feature of historical fiction), and he does not make his protagonists characters with an absurdly modern perspective on science and society (another all-too-common feature of the genre). Harris also does an excellent job of presenting a world already in motion, rife with plots and schemes and lives which would have been absolutely fascinating in their own right even if they hadn't been interrupted by the eruption of Vesuvius. ...more An excellent read!

The volcano seemed to catch the citizens of Pompeii and other bay cities unaware., which is hard for me to understand. In every account I have read about the 79 A.D. eruption, the extreme heat has been noted. Whether that extreme heat was normal summer weather or was a phenomenon of the quakes and the volcano, I am not certain. I do like the way the author connected the duct water insufficiency, the mangled duct work, and other anomalies with the volcanic activity. Perhaps the people were caught unaware because their immediate worry was the lack of water in the sweltering heat. We know that Pliny the Elder died in the eruption but not before scientifically documenting activities relative to the quakes and the volcano. He died doing what he did best and doing that which he required of himself. I recommend the book readers of all genres. Thank you, Mr. Harris, for a Good Read. ...more I gave this book 4 stars because the protagonist (Marcus Attilius Primus) and I share the same profession - that of being a civil engineer.

Not much depth to set the characters in this tale apart from those in any other novel about the time period: an overbearing father, a defiant daughter, a submissive wife, etc. Having previously read Harris's Imperium and Conspirata I was expecting Pompeii to be more on par with those works, but it wasn't quite there. Still, it was an enjoyable read. Bettie's Books One cataclysmic disaster can ruin your whole day, but at least it has the advantage of surprise.

Who honestly didn't feel the urge to push a few heads under water to speed up James Cameron's interminable \"Titanic\"? We endure documentaries about German aerodynamics because we want to see the Hindenburg in flames. \"Oh, the banality!\" Robert Harris confronts this very problem in his new novel about the explosion of Vesuvius, called simply \"Pompeii.\" When the story opens on Aug. 22, AD 79, we know that by the end of the week, none of these characters will be shouting \"TGIF.\" But how to fill the pages till that moment when the mountain erupts with a force 100,000 times as strong as the Hiroshima atomic bomb, shooting magma at a speed of Mach 1? Harris admits that he just barely avoided disaster himself. After observing the United States for more than a year, he had intended to write a novel set in the near future. \"The story I had in mind,\" he says, \"might loosely be described as 'The Walt Disney Company takes over the world': a thriller about a utopia going horribly wrong,\" but \"the characters stubbornly refused to come alive and the subject remained as flimsy as smoke.\" Or, perhaps he realized that Julian Barnes had already written that novel brilliantly just three years ago in \" England, England .\" But for whatever reason, we've been spared another Brit's satire of America (\" Vernon God Little \" is enough to endure for this season), and given this terrifically engaging novel instead. The key to Harris's success is his concentration on a crisis that preceded the volcano's eruption by two days. Back in 33 BC, the Romans had constructed a 60-mile aqueduct that eventually served towns all along the Bay of Naples, giving rise to a culture and an economy that floated high on the presumption of dependable, clean water. When a break in the main line begins shutting off one town after another, only Marcus Attilius Primus knows how to save the day. Attilius, as he's called, is a young widower, a water engineer from a long line of water engineers, who's just been appointed to Misenum, home to a Roman fleet. His early weeks on the job have been rough: His predecessor has vanished mysteriously, his staff mocks his authority, and now the water has stopped flowing for the first time in 100 years, threatening to plunge a quarter of a million people into dry chaos. Piecing together reports from travelers about the status of other towns along the coast, Attilius quickly deduces that the break must be some- where near Pompeii. As the reservoir drains in Misenum, he secures permission from Pliny the Elder (wonderfully brought back to life here) and heads out with a small, reluctant crew. The passage of 2,000 years has not diminished the technical dimensions of this task - nor the social risks of failure. Harris conveys the modern elements of this ancient life with startling effect. One can't help considering the two crumbling tunnels that supply New York City with all of its water. Let's hope there are many Attiliuses toiling away on Tunnel No. 3, to be completed in 2020. (Sip slowly, New Yorkers.) In fact, what's even more interesting than the mechanical aspects of this ancient system are the moral developments that Harris traces through these characters. First-century Romans enjoyed the benefits of a remarkably advanced system of commerce, science, and art, but their society was dogged by that familiar triumvirate of corruption, cruelty, and sloth. Attilius emerges as a timeless hero, a man driven by duty but animated by compassion, courageous enough to fight nature, but wise enough to fear its fury. His struggle to solve this engineering crisis, fend off his mutinying workers, and resist the grief that always threatens to wash back over him makes him an utterly fascinating and sympathetic character. And though he's far removed from the sophisticated economy humming around him, he demonstrates that essential requirement for a successful market economy: integrity. But in the literary tradition of all great struggles, the flashier part goes to the villain. Numerius Popidius Ampliatus rose from slave to master the modern way: insider trading. Cruel and clever, he's both Caligula and Ken Lay. We meet him on the afternoon he's trying to generate a little entertainment by feeding a servant to the eels. Attilius interferes, earning Ampliatus's rage and his daughter's heart. But this self-made crook owns a heavily mortgaged empire of bathhouses that need cheap water so he pretends to support Attilius's emergency efforts - at least until he can kill him. Of course, while our hero races against the clock to stave off a collapse of the aqueduct and avoid being murdered, we know that his clock is about to be blasted away by one of history's most spectacular natural disasters. Harris marks the passing hours and minutes with fanciful precision at the beginning of each chapter, along with pithy quotations from volcano experts ancient and modern. If the present-day dialogue sounds a bit incongruous in togas and the romance a bit forced, such minor objections are quickly blasted away. When the moment finally arrives - a column of magma shooting miles into the sky - the story rises spectacularly to convey the surreal conditions that tortured these people for days: the sea filled with pumice, the ground rolling in waves, whole towns flash-burned, asphyxiated, and then sealed beneath tons of ash. But Harris hasn't brought those haunting, calcified forms to life just for the sport of entombing them again 2,000 years later. The light he shines on that awesome crisis, and the way good and bad people responded, illuminates our continued dependence on the most fundamental elements - a stable earth and a righteous man. http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1118/p1... ...more", "Title": "Pompeii"},
