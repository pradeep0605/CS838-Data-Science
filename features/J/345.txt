I can't even really discuss what characters feature in this story because that, too, would be a spoiler. This review has absolutely no spoilers in the main part. Down below, if you scroll to the very bottom of the page, you will see some comments and thoughts of mine that contain spoilers but they are well marked and easily avoided. My best chance for providing a spoiler-free review for you is to just describe my general feel of the book. This is really the easiest way for me to do that. Reading this book was like that scene out of Napoleon Dynamite where Pedro promises his class that if they vote for him, all their dreams will come true.<---F> Shadowfever was a little like that</---F>. In the first four books, KMM promised that if I just picked this one up, ALL MY DREAMS WOULD COME TRUE. And you know what? KMM wasn't fucking around. Pictured: Not Fucking Around She did everything I believed was absolutely impossible. She did it with class, she did it with style and she actually made me happy that I put my faith in this series. That's a pretty big order to fill. As promised, the Shadowfever delivered WITH fireworks. Part of it was that Mac was such a singularly self-introspective character. Every thought,<---M> every action</---M>, every word or omission was examined with cruel, objective efficiency. And even when she lied to herself, she always came back later with a big hammer of truth and shattered those illusions until those illusions were SORRY and promised to never illude (<---B>made up word alert</---B>) again. She defied a mainstay of western literature in her savagery and need for vengeance. Most (Disclaimer: Not all) literature idealizes woman as the forgiving creature who prefers to get on with her life as opposed to wasting it on vengeance. Probably so that she can get down to the baby making that is so important. This is a particular problem in the romance genre where KMM first made her big break. Women do not traditionally want to hold the cooling body of their enemy while blood drips to the floor and their hand twists the weapon that has brought an end to their vengeance. Usually, that's a man thing. But, you see, Mac takes responsibility for her own vengeance. She takes responsibility for the world - despite how much she doesn't want to. We see repeatedly in the first four books that as much as she wants to shift the burden, she doesn't. That takes a special kind of strength. All the while reading this series, I was only glad it was Mac's story and not mine. Kat's story would have ended with shagging V'lane ruthlessly because Kat couldn't keep it in her pants when sexy came calling. The end. I just would have trusted my gut and hoped that Barrons, Rowena or V'lane of the MacKeltars knew better. Who was I to decide the fate of the world? Shadowfever sorely tests that aspect of Mac, that strength to not rely on others to solve her problems. I cannot sing KMM's praises enough for this. Princesses who sit in castles waiting for the noble prince to find them, romance heroine's whose honourable, rich lover turns up to rescue them... Their stories pale in comparison to a lead character who rolls with the punches that life gives her and does everything in her power to punch back. The single problem that I have with this book is its inability to let go of other western (and other cultures are to blame too) ideals that we place on our female leads. The concept of action for selfish reasons is briefly addressed in this book and I felt that KMM was handling it so well. I felt that Mac's selfishness and desire to use power for her own means were actually so well justified by the past text that maybe she SHOULD be allowed to use the ultimate power to achieve her means. This concept was later twisted and garbled though and, without going into detail, was the only small botherance I really had with what was other a fantastic novel and a spectacular end to this amazing series. SPOILERS BELOW *************** **Spoilers Commencing:** There is actually more of a reason that I didn't give this book more than four stars and why I might decide to bump it down to three. Reading up to this book several fans, including myself, picked apart the other four looking for clues. We were so sure that Barron's identity, Mac's mysterious past, the Unseelie King, the purpose of the book... we were so sure that the answers were staring us right in the face and that we just needed to find the right set of evidence to figure it out. But now I know that for the lie it was. Some things were cleverly concealed, like the identity of Alanna's killer and the holder of her journal. However, all of the rest, I feel, were kept from us. You can't deduce what Barrons is from the pitiful amount of information provided in the first four books and nothing will prepare you for the rather annoying truth. He's something never before seen. Never before heard of. There's no myth, no legend. It was never something we COULD guess. Same with Mac's origins. How could you actually know that the book was capable of absorbing itself into a fetus? You can't. You never have enough information that you could have deduced that. So whilst I really enjoyed Shadowfever, I felt a bit cheated that KMM wasn't the brilliant creator, cleverly concealing the truth so that the truly observant amongst her readership could arrive at the right conclusions. She just didn't give us enough information. Maybe that sounds like whining. Maybe it sounds like a petulant child, stamping its foot and saying, \"It's not fair!\" Well, truthfully, if a mystery writer finished a novel and the hero came out and said, \"It was the Maid in the poolroom with the candlestick but you wouldn't have been able to guess that because I'm only now presenting the information necessary to come to that conclusion!\" Well, in that case you'd think the mystery writer was cracked. Half the fun is in trying to be smarter than the protagonist. In this case, none of us really had a chance. Also, Mac's a big whimpy coward who should have told Barrons right from the getgo that she loved him. My other problem with this entire series is the nature of women and men portrayed. Mac and Dani are the only good, powerful women portrayed and Dani is just a child. The Fae are supposed to be matriarchal yet they are effectively led by V'lane. The women don't really have any power. The so-called queen is weak, ineffectual and needs to be protected by a Prince who also does all the work for her. In the confrontation between Seelie and Unseelie we see that the female fae have no voice or authority over the men and their opinions are easily discarded. All the big players in this book are men with the sole exception of Rowena, who is not only a total bitch but also weak and obviously a very poor leader with bad judgement. Women who gain power in this series, with the sole exception of Mac, become bad. The Seelie Queen is depicted as cruel, jealous and ultimately defeated by her more powerful husband. Might makes right for Barrons and his men whose views on women make cavemen look fair and reasonable. The MacKeltars are just as bad and reading this book gives the distinct impression that Mac's vagina (and who gets it) is just as important as Mac's abilities. Barrons becomes furious with Mac in Dreamfever for withholding information about the Book because apparently this is the one thing he's after. YET, he knows that Mac's search for her sister's killer is the one thing she's after and he is all too happy to keep information about that to himself. Fiona gains some power by eating unseelie flesh in these novels yet she is ultimately a doormat to her petty emotions for Barrons. Not a single one of the major book players (McCabe, Malluce, O'Bannion) are female. Women simply don't have power in the Fever world. Even if they're supposed to. ...more I read this book back in early March. March . And I left one of those little notes saying that I was going to compile my thoughts and would be back soon to write a review. Well, um, it seems it took me a bit longer than I thought possible to get over everything I experienced with this series. Truth be told, I'm still reeling from it. Unlike a good few other readers, I didn't nab each book as it came out and it wasn't until around the time that Shadowfever was being released that I actually picked I read this book back in early March.

Well, um, it seems it took me a bit longer than I thought possible to get over everything I experienced with this series. Truth be told, I'm still reeling from it. Unlike a good few other readers, I didn't nab each book as it came out and it wasn't until around the time that Shadowfever was being released that I actually picked up the first book - Darkfever . But I read them all in the space of a week. I honestly don't know how I would have survived if I'd read each book as they were released and I'm just thankful that I didn't have to wait between that dreaded cliffhanger at the end of Dreamfever and the final book. How did some of you cope? This series is an addiction in every way. The last time I became so addicted to a story and its characters was back when I was watching Buffy . This is a book and a series that I feel very strongly about and, because of that, I want to say what needs to be said to get everyone to read it. What can I tell you? Well... there's a heroine who both kicks ass and paints her nails Barbie pink, Mac is the perfect mix of strong and feminine. Don't let Kristin Cashore kid you that those two don't mix, Mac will prove you wrong. If it weren't for Barrons I'd probably have developed a literary crush on Mac instead. Ah, but Barrons... Apparently a few women don't like Barrons and I suppose everyone's entitled to their own opinion but... SERIOUSLY WTF? YOU DON'T LIKE BARRONS?? I'm joking. Sort of. Maybe. Anyway, I happen to think Barrons is one of the sexiest characters in any book I've ever read. He takes crap from no one, he seems serious most of the time but he's got a wicked sexy grin when he wants to. I like how KMM didn't make him into some hero, she never tried to redeem him and made it clear that Barrons has no time or need for redemption. He's the biggest, baddest alpha and he loves it... and you know you do too! But I'm going to sell this series all wrong if I'm not careful. This isn't a paranormal romance, it's an urban fantasy. The key difference being the quality of the story and mythology. Don't go thinking that it was just these awesome characters that kept me mesmerised for the full five books. There's mystery and supernatural creatures (yes, they're fairies but DO NOT let that put you off), there's murder and the dredging up of past secrets... it has everything. This series is one of my all time favourites. It can make you laugh and make you cry. There's smut (woo!) without making it a book all about sex and there's well thought out mythology that is never boring. What else can I say? Read it. ...more Update 12/22/2014 I still think it's agreat story and I still think the first part needed some trimming - too much recapping and too much horny angst.

So much depended on the quality of this last installment and, thank goodness, Moning didn't disappoint. Shadowfever is not one of those series finales that you want to forget ever reading. Quite the opposite. There is a lot to be said about benefits of series' outlining. I strongly believe that a series with no pre-planning has almost no chance of succeeding. We are lucky Moning knows her stuff. This last installment is a twisty tale, with so many revelations and surprises, your head will spin. After speculating for months who was who or what and what everyone's motives were, I have to admit, I guessed correctly almost none of it. It takes talent to write an ending that is so satisfying and with the outcome we all wanted, and make it so exciting and unpredictable until the very last page. Shadowfever is not a flawless book. Some vital revelations were not foreshadowed properly. I also found the 1st part of the book a little hard to connect with. It gave me painful flashbacks of being in Katniss' head in Mockingjay (I love that book by the way). But the moment the 2nd part begins, oh my, there is no stopping that train! I ended up staying up most of last night telling myself - just one more chapter... And the flaws? Well, even though there is plenty of them, the final result is still deliciously satisfying. I feel exhilarated and uplifted after finishing Shadowfever . Do not worry, it ends well, even though the path to HEA is a thorny and angsty one. Yes, the series became darker and darker over time, but Moning wasn't lying assuring us that Fever series was about light and not darkness. Indeed it is. Shadowfever is about light, about survival and, of course, love. Love makes appearance in many unexpected forms in this novel. I also have to give Moning a special credit the fae world she had created. It is by far the most creative, complex and convoluted (in a good way) take on fae mythology I have ever encountered. And of course there is that VERY IMPORTANT part of the series we all can't get enough of. I don't think there are many fantasy hunks out there who could rival Jericho Barrons. He is the one very-very bad guy who you simultaneously want to run away from and do bad-bad things to him behind the bookshelves in BB&B... Goodness, I feel hot flashes just thinking about him! I look forward to reading Fever books again and again in all their sexy, violent, intriguing glory. And there are more Fever universe books on the way.

I don't think it's any big spoiler to say that by the end of this book, the Unseelie are mostly wiped out of Dublin. Most people probably assumed that would happen or at least hoped. As I sit here wearing my \"Dublin rocks\" t-shirt (I'm not exaggerating), pondering and daydreaming, I have come across a great revelation. I am ruined. I am ruined for every single other urban fantasy. I am ruined for every other paranormal romance. Hell, I'm ruined for every other book EVER. How could I go back to YA after this? How can I go on in urban fantasy when I started at the top? How can I ever read another book again?!?! Of course, I'm being melodramatic but somewhere inside, I feel it's true. I know I'll get over it. Eventually. While I loved it, I had quite a few issues with this book, so here we go: 1. The Dani Perspective - Dani is a relentless spitfire. Unfortunately that means what often spews forth from her is fire and it's painful. It burns my eyes and my brain. I love Dani but enough with the rambling, woman! I felt like every time we were dumped into Dani's head, it was tedious and unnessecary. A technique that is used by writers of lesser talent to rachett up the tension between the scenes that you actually want to be in. KMM is better than that. She doesn't need to use this ploy. Not to mention, it's annoying as feck inside Dani's head. 2. The Gimmicks - The Dani Daily, the quotes and song lyrics before every \"part\", the conversations with the Sinsar Dubh, switching of perspectives. Once again, KMM is better than this. And if all these things are so important to the mythology of the series, where were they in all the previous books? Why fling these on us now? We didn't need them. All it did was take away from time I'd rather be spending with our main characters. 3. The info dumps and recaps - By the halfway point, I felt like almost nothing had happened. So much time was spent rehashing past events and reintroducing red herrings and 'clues'. This was happening much more often than was necessary. Along with tons of internal dialogue and speculation. Am I this? Am I that? Is he this or that? Blah blah blah. Just get to the action. 5. Lovetastic Endless Forever Love - Yes, its what we've always wished for! But as soon as Barrons and Mac got together and (sort of) declared their love, I was bored. I know that's childish of me but I wanted hate sex! Not loooooove sex. Boring! I know that once again I'm being melodramatic but KMM basically turned us into Pavlov's dogs, training us to drool every time Barrons acted animalistic. And she did it with good reason. I felt the scenes thereafter were a little too cheesealicious. And apparently, (view spoiler) [Barrons has a magic wingding! (hide spoiler) ] Oh damn, I'm drooling again... MEEEEEE-YOW! 4. And the thing that pisses me off the most - I still don't know what the feck Barrons is! I mean, I know \"what\" he is, but I don't know why or what the hell it has to do with the rest of the story. It's like she took two completely unrelated stories and mythologies and meshed them together. It frustrates me quite a bit. But do I care? A little. Would I take any of it back? Hell no. The way I see it is: it's about the journey not the destination. Much the way I felt at the end of Lost - What the faaaaaa? What the batman was the smoke monster? Maybe it was Batman! The effing writers don't even know!! And Battlestar Galactica - Why the frak? I still don't know what the bejesus Starbuck was? Was she Jesus?? Hell if I know! Hell if she knows! Sure, I was disappointed that I didn't get the exact answers that I wanted. I'm not always sure if I got ANY answers (mainly with Lost). But regardless - the journey was incredible, intense, and inspiring. If I had been hung up on the answers, I never would have been able to feel the full range of the emotions of the characters. I wouldn't have been able to vicariously live out adventures through the people in the book or on the screen. If I only focused on the logic and found myself unable to suspend my disbelief, I'd have the emotional range of a robot (well, these days that might be becoming less and less limited but you get what I'm saying, I hope.) Maybe life isn't always about the answers, maybe it's about the search. I love it when you get inside a book. You become the book - flowing out of and into it like some sort of monster, helplessly attached. KMM's books are the Sinsar Dubh and I am the Beast. Overall, I was consumed by these books. I loved the series, the story arch and the characters. What an amazing journey! I feel like dancing around throwing confetti , riding a magic carpet through the sky while singing , and slathering my face with birthday cake !! DOUBLE DREAM HANDS EXTREEEEEEEEME!!! I don't know what to do with myself now. I'm going to have to revert to the hermit version of myself, who can only be consoled by eating peanut butter and apple slices while watching Buffy or Battlestar reruns and is only truly happy while watching and singing along to the Buffy Musical \"Once More with Feeling.\" We've all talked before about who should play the characters in a movie, but I've changed my mind -- I don't want a movie. I WANT A FECKIN TV SHOW!!!! I want to see Barrons every damn week. Not just two hours of glorious hotness and beauty in one year. I want twenty-two hours!! For years to come. Don't you want to see someone who looks similar to this on TV? Seriously. With the mega success of shows like the Vampire Dairies and True Blood, why hasn't someone come up with something to compete or stand on the same level but from a different mythology. With the right people at the helm, this could . This could surpass it. Not to mention, I would love to see Kristen Bell on a series again and she's perfect for Mac. God knows it would be difficult to find a man hot enough to play Barrons, but it would be so worth it when they did. I'm actually getting goosebumps talking about seeing him on my TV every week . Really, only in a TV show , could the characters fully be explored and fleshed out. Only then could we really experience their changes. Shadowfever was the #1 NYT Bestseller. That HAS to speak for the power of it's reach and it's fans. I know nothing about websites or blogs but pleeeeeeease - if there is anyone reading who does, start some sort or petition for a TV show based on the Fever series.

Shadowfever did NOT need to be the length that it was, that it was stretched out entirely too long with unnecessary emo verse and Mac Version 200 Questions made me want to stab someone. Here are just 2 of endless examples in which a paragraph of questions are used to tell the story: \u201cWhat would happen when we finally had the Book under lock and key? How did Barrons think he was going to use it once it was contained? Did he know the First Language? Was he that old? Had he learned it over time, or been taught? Did he plan to let us re-inter it at the abbey again, then sit down and read it? And do what with the knowledge?\u201d pg 372 \u201cWas she bad because she\u2019d loved him? Was he evil because he\u2019d wanted to reclaim what had been taken from him? Hadn\u2019t the same motives driven the Unseelie King and his concubine? Didn\u2019t the same motives drive humans every day? Why hadn\u2019t the queen just let the king have the woman he loved? Why couldn\u2019t the king be happy with one lifetime? What might have happened to the Unseelie if they\u2019d never been imprisoned? Might they have turned out like the Seelie court? And what about my sister and me? Would we really doom the world? Nurture or nature: What were we?\u201d pg 452 That is just crappy storytelling, for me. The equivalent to pages and pages of paragraph questions like this throughout the book is not endearing to me. I know that KMM has used this style of writing in previous books, but it was too excessive for me to forgive. Should I go on with the things that really bothered me? She is looking through a photo album of Alina\u2019s, and she opens up to a picture Alina took of her and Darroc having sex and the shot is him as he\u2019s coming. Wait. What? Let me get this straight. Alina took a picture of Darroc right when he is orgasming inside of her, had it developed, and then put it in to her photo album along with photos of her birthday parties and shit? Are you serious? /INSERT ME GAGGING HERE/: \u201cFrom the look on his face, I knew he was coming when she took it. And I could see it in his eyes. He\u2019d loved her, too.\u201d That just ain\u2019t right! By the middle of the book I was channeling Dave Chappelle chanting \u201cWrap. It. Up!\u201d She\u2019s the concubine. No, she\u2019s the Unseelie King, no wait, she\u2019s only one of many parts of him, she\u2019s becoming Fae, she\u2019s here, she\u2019s there, what is he, where is he, it just became ridiculous. By the time she takes Barrons by the hand and kills him AGAIN by trying to get him through the Unseelie King\u2019s silver in his boudoir, I threw in the towel. Again she kills him? Again she says \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Overkill. Enough! Tell us what the BLEEP is going on, already! Then, what is ultimately revealed about who Mac is, is just silly. She was \u201ctouched\u201d in the womb by the Sinshar Du and that\u2019s how she and it are connected? How she has all these memories? I\u2019ve waited over a year for this? And Christian. What was the point of Christian\u2019s evolution from Druid to Unseelie Prince? Huh? I did like several parts of the book. I enjoyed the world building. I felt like I could really see the White Mansion, and the Unseelie Prison. I also loved when Darroc was decapitated, and all Mac was concerned about was putting his head back on and torturing information out of him. That was AWESOME! I think this was my favorite quote from the book: \u201cDarroc is no longer about to kiss me, because his head is gone\u2014just gone\u2014and you\u2019re never ready for that, no matter how cold and hard and dead you think you are inside. Being sprayed by the blood of a headless corpse\u2014especially someone you know, whether you like him or not\u2014gets you on a visceral level. Doubly so when you were about to kiss that person. But even more upsetting is that I don\u2019t know how to merge with the Book. All I can think is: His head is gone and I don\u2019t know how to merge with the Book. He eats Unseelie. Can I put his head back on? If I do, can he talk? Maybe I can patch him up and torture it out of him.\u201d pg 149 Another part that highly amused me, even if it was not totally buyable, was that V\u2019lane this entire time was Cruce, the last Unseelie Prince. I honestly did not see V\u2019lane\u2019s deception coming at all. I did like the plot twist of Dani leading Alina to her demise, too. I loved of course that she and Barrons AFTER 4 BOOKS and 450 PAGES OF THIS BOOK finally gave in to one another, but by the time it happened, for me it was too little too late. I was really passed the point where I could take their anger/stress/sexual tension any longer and I was sick of them both by part 4. And then, after all these millennia of Barrons searching for the Sinshar Du at all costs to end his son\u2019s suffering, that part of the story is resolved in the last 2 pages and it is something so ridiculously simple? All the things he has done to track the book, the people he has hurt and killed, and his problem is solved, wrapped up in a nice little bow at the very end? And we never learn what Barrons really is other than \u201ca Beast\u201d. What are he and his 8 really? She couldn\u2019t give that to her readers? Who was the mother of his child? And how did Fiona know all of this about his inability to die and more, more than Mac did? How did Fiona initially fit in to all this? Hey!

The many ladies who hang out at the Fever Water Cooler are constantly gushing over the unparalleled hotness of a one Jericho Barrons. They claim he is THE most delicious thing to have ever graced our bookshelves. Let me be the one to tell you: THEY WERE NOT KIDDING I have done nothing, NOTHING at all for the past four days except drink coffee, pee when necessary, and swoon over Jericho Barrons. And now it's over. *Cue my husbands' giant sigh of relief* So here's a question for you Karen Marie.

Och) and the heroines who think they\u2019re lacking in redeeming qualities, but are adored and thought to be perfect by these lusty gimme an Och burly heroes that any women would tear off their kilts to get a taste of what they don\u2019t wear underneath them. When I heard Karen was going to start a new series that wasn\u2019t a romance, but more along the lines of a paranormal mystery about a young woman who goes in search of her sister\u2019s killer, I wasn\u2019t interested in reading. When Darkfever came out, I didn\u2019t pay much mind. But then as more books were published and the ultimate cliffhanger with Faefever and the electric Chapter 4 in Dreamfever, including the elusive, mysterious and cocky character of Barrons, that\u2019s when I started to change my mind. When so many are so far gone over a series of books and the word \u201ccrack\u201d is used, I think of JR Ward\u2019s BDB series, which is my crack. So, two weeks before Shadowfever was published I started reading the first four books so by the time Shadowfever came out I\u2019d be caught up on everything. I\u2019m warning all the Fever and Barrons fans that this post isn\u2019t going to praise these books. So, if you are a hardcore lover of these books, you may want to stop reading here and move onto another blog that has big accolades of the Fever series. I\u2019m in the minority because on a whole the Fever series was a big disappointment for me. *waits as Bieber Fever girls.. oops I mean Barrons Fever girls leave to sigh over le Douche\u2026* Yes, that\u2019s right, my nickname for Jericho Barrons is le Douche. When did I come to the conclusion that Barrons is a douche? Pretty much by the second book. But before I go on with my rant about Barrons le Douche, let\u2019s start at the beginning with <---C>MacKayla Lane</---C>. MacKayla, who everyone calls Mac, lives in Ashford, Georgia with her parents. The twenty-two year old spends her days bartending, tanning hanging out with friends and is a proud girly-girl who has a pink fetish, loves doing her hair and nails and has no qualms that she\u2019s beautiful. Her older sister Alina is in Dublin, Ireland studying at Trinity College. Mac\u2019s entire world is about to go to hell in a hand basket one hot summer day when she finds out Alina has been killed. No one knows why Alina was murdered, and the authorities in Dublin pretty much close the case even before they can start to investigate. Mac refuses to let this be, especially since Alina left a frightened message on her cell phone a few hours before she was killed. Mac takes it upon herself to go over to Dublin and get answers. She owes it to Alina and herself to find out what happened. Mac goes to Dublin without any real plan. The police can\u2019t or won\u2019t answers her questions and Alina\u2019s teachers and fellow students have no clue about her whereabouts or who she hung out with because she began to cut class and became secretive. Alina had a lover named Darroc who has the power of the persuasive voice behind him. Mac believes Darroc (A character who has appeared in Moning's Highlander series) knows what may have happened to Alina, or he kiled her, but doesn\u2019t want to be found. Mac is basically backed into a corner and it looks like Alina\u2019s murder will never get solved. But then Mac starts seeing things that are not normal. Very freaky OMGWTFBBQ things. Cutting to the chase here- Mac has the ability to see the Fae because she\u2019s a sidhe-seer, from an ancient Celtic blood-line who can see the Fae. The Fae uses illusions, and there are different types, a cast system or sorts from the Seelie to the Unseelie and a whole bunch more that would take an entire semester of history class to understand. The wall between Man and Faery is coming down and Mac will be the one to stop it as she continues to find her sister\u2019s killer and hunt a book called the Sinsar Dubh, a Fae relic that can possess humans. Mac meets Jericho Barrons, who runs Barrons Books and Baubles. Barrons doesn\u2019t like Mac at all and keeps it just business between them by calling her Ms. Lane while she calls him Barrons. I call him Le Douche. Douche needs Mac because she\u2019s the only one who can locate the Sinsar Dubh. Most of the action are these two searching for the demon book and Mac opening her eyes to the Fae around her, such as V\u2019lane the prince of the Tuath De\u2019 Danaan, a fine specimen of Fae who can literally kill you through too many orgasms during sex. Mac and V\u2019lane become friends in a strange way while Barrons is always there taunting Mac and NEVER ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS SHE HAS. Mac gets frustrated by Barrons\u2019s aloofness and cruel demeanor while she fantasizes about his body, tattoos and his fast cars and bookstore she lusts after as much as she lust after him, but doesn't want the scary thing hiding under his garage that Barrons won\u2019t say what it is because BARRONS DOESN\u2019T ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS MAC ASKS HIM. Slowly\u2026 oh so very slowly, Mac gets closer to the truth as she goes from cutesy Barbie doll Legally Blonde Elle Woods to black wearing, I\u2019m going to kick some ass ala Linda Hamilton from Terminator 2. All the while she lusts after Barrons, who acts like Batman, appearing for short amounts of time to act snarky and rude to Mac knowing she\u2019s practically in heat for him. I guess his snappish insults are like foreplay for them both. I have three big issues why the Fever series didn\u2019t work. The fact that Barrons le Douche refuses to answer any questions thrown his way by Mac is a poor attempt to keep the tension alive. It\u2019s a throwback plot device that doesn\u2019t work and is a weakness on the part of the author to keep the reader invested in finding the answers. Having Barrons act like a petulant spoiled boy, much like a douche, by refusing to give up anything is almost insulting. Also the screen time with Barrons is very minimal if you think of it. He comes and goes with no real purpose and I wonder if Karen\u2019s original plans for Barrons wasn\u2019t as important to the overall story arc who was transformed into a more important role based on readers\u2019 reactions. I had a big issue with Mac\u2019s constant internalization. Shadowfever is very guilty of this. Mac is a wonderful character who grows in every single book even with the long winded inner monologues, while Barrons is stagnant. The excuse could be is because Barrons is thousands upon thousands of years old, but you think he\u2019d have some therapeutic change based on Mac being in his life. I was waiting for that moment where Barrons does have that light bulb moment with Mac. Sorry, by him accepting Mac as his lover and showing through hot sex that she\u2019s the one for him, is not good enough for me. Finally, The Fever series as a whole is very watered down. I can appreciate the mythology of it all, but at times I felt this was very surface type reading. It may just be me, but I like more descriptive explanations and much of the action was glossed over. I had problems trying to get a handle on things and what was going on. I also felt poor Mac was being thrown in every which direction for no purpose (this happens a great deal in Shadowfever). And destroying a character\u2019s psyche and spirit by constantly throwing horrible things at them such as a death of a loved one, being threatened, brutally raped and then being insulted left and right, is not a good enough or valid reason to show how your main character, such as Mac, can walk though the fires, be burned to a crisp and come out stronger than ever. The Fever series just didn\u2019t work for me. I could continue to go on with other reasons, including why I think Barrons is the perfect example of an abusive, manipulative emotionally stunted jerk, but that would take a whole other post. For what it\u2019s worth, I do have to mention how the tone of Feminism is very strong in this series. At no point does Mac rely on a man to save her. Barrons doesn\u2019t really come to her rescue at any point, unless you count the one time when he helps her bring her out of her Py\u2019ra, the almost death by Fae sex (Which I kept thinking of She-Ra). But the again, it wasn\u2019t a totally unselfish move on Barrons part either. Karen does make a great case for \u201cGirl Power\u201d in the form of Mac and the thirteen year old Dani who becomes Mac\u2019s backup and her new found sister and sidhe warrior in arms. How I wished I could have enjoyed these books, but they fell so flat for me. Also, this could have worked better as a trilogy than over five books. Bloodfever, book #2, doesn\u2019t bring anything worthwhile to the series. I will say this, Karen does sure know how to write some great one-liners and dialogue. What may be the most effective line from all these books still sticks with me. It was first mentioned by Barrons in Dreamfever and brought up by Mac again toward the end of Shadowfever where Mac and Barrons finally are completely honest with one another. Barrons tells Mac she\u2019ll find a man who will kiss her until she can\u2019t breathe, where she\u2019ll realize she doesn\u2019t need air. Mac has found that with Barrons, and since the Fever series isn\u2019t technically a romance, their HEA is the least likely normal one that should be expected, even if their road to their HEA was less than ideal for me. For this reader, I very much had my breath the entire time while reading the Fever series and didn\u2019t lose my breath once because of the overall lacking enjoyment I found as I read. ...more \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 5+ EPIC, ONE OF A KIND, MIND-BLOWING STARS. \"Evil is bad that believes it's good.\" Exciting, exhilirating, intense, powerful, highly unique, nerve-wracking, unputdownable, emotional and unforgettable.

This series is an absolute must read! \"The good guys and bad guys aren't as easy to tell apart as I used to think they were. You can't look at someone with your eyes and take their measure. You have to look with the heart.\" In this final installment of the intoxicating and mind-boggling Fever-series by Karen Marie Moning, MacKayla Lane will have to fight the final battle. Everything and everyone will come together in a final attempt to hunt and catch the Sinsar Dubh and save the world from being destroyed with evil and darkness. Good and evil are even more difficult to tell part this time around. Mac discovers that nothing is as it seems and that she has to rely on no one but herself to overcome the ultimate evil, hiding in the deepest and darkest shadows of Dublin. \"Some things are sacred. Until you act like they're not. Then you lose them.\" Shadowfever started out with an unexpected event that left Mac (and me) heartbroken. Overcome with grief, she's even willing to (temporarily) switch sides and team up with her allegedly number one enemy, Barroc. But then, new secrets and proficies are revealed that once again, turn her entire world upside down. Mac has no idea who or what she is anymore and no-one seems to be able to provide her with an answer. But the battle must go on and together with allies she's determined to make the world a better place once again. Mac Lane is by far one of the strongest, most heroic female leads I've ever come across. Time and again, she gets knocked down by the ones she hates, sometimes by the one's she moves and trusted and mostly by life itself. Bureauchef time, she gets back up and is determined to fitgh until the bitter end. The transformation she's undergone since the first time she sat foot in Dublin, is starting and impressive. She's gone from Rainbow Girl to OOP detector and sidhe-seer to a grown-up, mature woman willing to fight for the one's she moves. All of this, of course, she wouldn't have been able to achieve without the help of everpresent, charismatic force that is Jericho Barrons . He's the ultimate alpha male and my new favorite book boyfriend. Seriously. That man is indestrutable. He's a force of nature, overcome by animalistic strength and confidence. He's the one that \"will never let her die\" . And when he gives his word, he always makes sure to keep it. In this final part we finally discover what he's been hiding about himself all this time and what him become the person he is today, all of which made me love him even more than I already did. \"Fire to his chill. Ice to her flame.\" All in all, this series turned out to be one of the best series I've read this year/ever. Going through Mac's eventful, action-filled, utterly fascinating journey was an amazing reading experience that will definitely stay with me for a very long time. I loved all the fantastic characters, but of course Mac and Barrons were my favorite ones. They've been through so much to get where they are now and in my opinion, they couldn't have gotten a better HEA (for now) than the one they now have. KMM is a brilliant and very talented writer and I can't wait to continue with the rest of this series (with hopefully much more of these characters and their crazy adventures!). \"You're Mac,\" he says. \"and I'm Jericho. And nothing else matters. Never will. You exist in a place that is beyond all rules for me. Do you understand that?\" I do. Jericho Barrons just told me he loves me. ...more First reread with my girl Tanya , January 2015. Think you'll be getting another review from me after this reread? Nope. Why? Burned . Tomorrow.

I loved dark Mac 5.0 and her ugly struggle with herself and with learning to trust Barrons. This book made me cry and maybe I'm just feeling emotional right now, but it all worked so much more this time. I had totally forgotten just HOW much happens in this book. SO many questions are answered. It's very satisfying. Very. If you haven't gotten into the series by now, this is not going to convert you because it's written in the same way. It's not a perfect book, and there are a few spots where it seem \"long,\" but it wraps up the whole arc from books 1-4, and leaves you wanting more. Karen Marie Moning writes very good in an emotionally-charged manner. I really felt for Mac and her and Barrons are just so fucking epic together. Sigh. I lurv them. Buddy Re-read with the MacHalo group , officially starting Monday, December 21, 2015, but some of us are starting early because that's the way we roll. New thoughts for second read: Now I remember why I couldn't give this book 5 stars... the hot-cold interactions with Barrons and Mac got too infuriating for me. I mean, we're at book 5 now right, and at times, it seemed like we had an intense scene where things were going to change with them and then we went straight back to where we were in book 1. That starts to feel like the author is just using certain tactics to play with reader emotions. There is *no* doubt the last part of this book is un-put-downable. It's explosive and amazing. But for such a long book, it just meandered too much and Mac's inner ramblings became tedious. Readers want Barrons - and of COURSE we do. He is the best part of the series, basically. But it begins to feel like the author is being stingy about him for most of this book. Yes, we got many answers and the scenes Barrons WAS in were the best ones. For book 5, it just felt like we were still getting too much angst and drama in their relationship. Original review So, that was pretty epic. This was a really long book that kind of felt overwhelming. The pacing was a little off at times and it meandered in ways that I found distracted me. But that was mainly ok overall. *Everything* is answered in this one, and I don't think I've ever read a book in a series that was so dense with vital information. Everyone's motivation, backstory, histories, reveals, etc. It's all here. I'm still not sure how I feel. Hold on, I need a drink. (view spoiler) [ I am happy with how things end with Mac and Barrons. Very happy. The earlier angst between them was starting to get to me so I am very happy all that is behind us. Not sure how I feel about V'lane being the big bad. He was always sketchy, but I kind of liked him. Now that I know he was never actually V'lane, and was in fact the evil Unseelie Prince, Cruce (and is a rapist), I can never like him in the earlier books during re-reads. I am very happy Rowena and Fiona got what was coming to them. Barron's son = mindblown. (hide spoiler) ] I'll probably add to this review later. There was just too much to process in one read.

You know, when I originally read this, I'd mostly just drooled all over the book in my haste to find out if any of my theories were right. I'd also not been exposed to Iced , so I didn't know that Moning was capable of writing a total turd. There were three main things that stood out to me this time around, that I overlooked hadn't noticed the first time. One , the pace was a bit too frenetic. I almost can't tell you what happened in the book, because Too Much Happened. This would have almost been better off as two books. Does that make sense? Not a deal-breaker for me, though. So... Two , Dani is a HORRIBLE character with no redeeming qualities. Yeah, I know she got on my nerves when I originally read the story, but that was before Iced , so I had no idea that Moning had such a gaping blind-spot where she was concerned. Every time I had to read that STUPID Dani Daily report, it was like someone raking their nails down a chalkboard. KILL HER! KILL HER WITH FIRE!!!!! Third thing that brought the rating down was the annoyingly juvenile OVER -use of acronyms. Sure, I get that Mac loves to give things goofy acronyms. OOPS, IFP, etc.. It's sort of her thing , and I didn't have a serious problem with her doing it occasionally. Occasionally. But. Eventually, my nerves wore thin. I think I finally snapped when Mac called the 'Dreamy Eyed Guy' DEG , and he called her BG ...which stands for Beautiful Girl . What?! Nobody does that! Nobody! That is so stupid, I don't even have words for it... FAIL! Still, this was an awesome ending to the original Fever series, and I'd recommend these to anyone who loves a good urban fantasy. Besides, you know this had to be good, if even Dani can't kill my love for it! Original (long-winded and spoilery) 5 star review: 2011 (view spoiler) [I read this a couple of days ago, but I was mentally waffling on the rating, so I decided to let my review ride until I could decide. Well, I've finally come to a decision (I know you all were just dying to find out how I felt...don't even try to deny it), so here comes the review. After I first finished it, I wasn't sure exactly how I felt (I already said that, didn't I?). Toward the end of the book it seemed like I was getting whiplash from all of the twists and turns the plot was taking. Red herrings were everywhere ! Too much! Too much! So, in my infinite wisdom, I wondered if I shouldn't knock off a star just because Ms. Moning annoyed me a teeny bit with all of her wacky antics. However, after I thought about it, I realized something. I am an idiot, and any infinite wisdom that may be floating around out there certainly doesn't belong to me! This book was the most fun I've had reading in ages! Ages! Was I really considering knocking a star off just because it was too exciting? I disgust myself. So, 5 stars for Shadowfever! Now let's get on with the spoilers! Dani, Dani, Dani. Did Dani's POV get on my feckin nerves? Uh, yeah. Let's hope if Ms. Moning continues in this world with Dani's story, it happens once she is older. Much older. As in, less feckin' young . Feckin' feckers. Feck. Second verse, same as the first ! Feckity-feck! Ugh. (In case you haven't read the book yet, Dani uses the word feck ...occasionally.) Alright, enough picking on Dani. Bring on the Barrons! * You may each take a minute here to reflect and drool on the great Jericho Barrons * Was that whole skin rippling during sex thing kinda icky? Absolutely. I thought Barrons bordered on disturbing for the entire book. Do I still love him? Oh, yeah! Bring your ripply monster-self over this way, honey! Grrrowr! So, he's got freaky horns and pisses circles around you to show you that he cares? I can deal with that. Why? 'Cause it's Barrons , that's why! Does it bother me that (after all of this time) we don't get to find out what Barrons is? Noooo. I, for one, am not the least bit disappointed. Really. *sigh* Ok. Maybe just a little bit. Or a lot. But, after I thought about it, I realised that one of the things that makes Barrons so darn sexy is that he's mysterious . I think Ms. Moning was right not to ruin the mystery...but that doesn't mean I have to like it! And what about that creepy feral kid of his? Holy Guacamole! I did not see that one coming! All this time I've been wondering what the hell was in his basement, and never once did the words rabid child run through my mind. Never . I was glad at the end that they were able to put him down...I mean, lay him to rest . Vlane, you skeevy bastard, I never liked you! And to think that I was actually feeling sorry for him after he asked Mac to choose between Barrons and himself! Gah! I always thought of Vlane as some idiot fairy prince who was just kind of thrown in there to give the plot a love triangle. Who woulda thunk it?! I felt like Karen (after 5 books, I can call her Karen, right?) jumped out at me at the end of this book and yelled, \"Gotcha, bitch!\". I guess anybody who bought a Team Vlane t-shirt is feeling a teensy bit silly, eh? Darroc's demise was another Whoa! moment for me. I mean, one minute he's there, and I'm all worried about whether or not Mac can outwit him, and the next minute... He has no head ! Mwhahahaha! Pure awesomeness! Now Rowena's death? Meh. I'm glad Mac got to be the one to run her skanky old ass through, but, honestly, I wanted her to suffer more. Really suffer . After all, she was the whole reason that Dani was involved in Alina's death! Poor Dani. Poor annoying Dani. Love that we got to find out who the Dreamy Eyed Guy was! Also, nice to see Christian again. One of the best parts of the book was when Barrons had a mini-stroke, because Mac couldn't take her eyes off of Christian's giant man-muscle! That was classic! Move over Jane Austin! Kidding. *whispers* You know nobody can ever replace you, Mr. Darcy. I was happy (and yet, surprised) to see the Unseelie King and his concubine get their Happily Ever After, too! He turned out to be quite the lovable character, didn't he? Last, but certainly not least, Mac. We finally get to find out what makes her so darn special ! Again, the truth in no way even slightly resembled anything that I had come up with. And, believe me, I had come up with some wacky shit over the past year. Why, you ask, could I not figure it out? Because Karen likes to give out Agatha Christie-like clues! Clues, that nobody besides the amazing Miss Marple, could piece together! Come on, be honest, did anyone out there figure this out? Anybody? Anybody? On a sad note, I can't believe it's over. *sob* So, if anyone has any recommendation on what to read next, please send them my way!

Last book has ended with a cruel cliffhanger and this one picks up from there. It all goes great, high strung emotions with good writing. The moment hope blossoms, Moning kills it and then starts pissing on it. We wade trough pages after pages of Mac's inner monologue and \"special moments\" from the first 4 book. I don't hate flashbacks or remembering important moments, but if you have to do it, give us something new besides it, make it original and keep it short for fucks sake. Don't try to boost the volume of your book -which is already too long- with fuckload of rehashing. I said bye felicia to my hopes and kept reading. Then finally came the moment I've been waiting for 4 fucking long books! Mac called herself on her denials, made decisions *even if they were prompted with death cliche, I overlooked that shitty plot liner completely*. She found a second chance, gathered her lady balls and at last we are about to get our Barrons and Mac coupling... What do you think happened? She realized her balls and spine are actually an illusion and pulled a Joffrey. At that point I carefully lowered my tablet -least I break it and screamed inside! I seriously considered DNFing right there, but I had gotten this far and at least wanted to have some questions answered. After everything happened, Mac reverted her cunty little pissant self. Again we got pages upon pages her whiny inner monologue. As if that wasn't enough we got to hear Dani's emo teenager inner monologue. Mac found out an information about herself so we had to hear it in circles. Same shit argued, monologued, written into the dairy and after more pages yet again same information... Denied, considered. And old shit heated up and fed to us. get to the point already rainbow girl! *that's how I picture Mac* If I had the paperback copy of this book, I would have torn off the unnecessary pages as I went to see how many essential ones I'm left with at the end. This drag assed book is 608 pages and if she had a decent editor, it would be 250 pages at most. And that's me being bloody generous! While the way she tied up the story could have been enjoyable, all I was feeling was a deep seated anger so I'm giving only 1 star for the story. The other star is for Barrons. By some miracle, she didn't fuck him up as I feared. He did not turn into sappy git. He was a beast and kept his assholishness till the bitter end. It just became woven with his love/madness. Even tough, I am done with this series due to anger issues, I don't regret reading it. Because Barrons is and probably will be my favourite hot jerk of all time. As for Mac... ...more She warms his frost. He cools her fever. That\u2019s me every time I read the Fever series. Every. Fucking. Time.

The first time I\u2019ve read Shadowfever, I thought it was the end of the series. I was expecting a shitload of answers and a decent conclusion to the series. Then something awesome and terrifying happened. Karen Marie Moning announced two more books. TWO BOOKS! I mean. What? My world just fell off its axis. I am so happy and yet I\u2019m so scared. What if they are worse than the other Fever books? What if Mac and Barrons\u2019 romance gets shitty? What if the story goes to hell? So many what-ifs. Too many. I\u2019m anxiously waiting and biting my nails while at it. Dani\u2019s Iced is going to be out on October 30th, 2012. Patiently waiting. Or at least I\u2019m trying to. Back to Shadowfever . It\u2019s been a while since I stressed myself as much as I did with this book. I had so many questions, so many theories. And they went to hell in a handcart with every chapter. Karen Marie Moning shamelessly played with my mind all along and I could not beat her until, say, 75% along the way. Very frustrating, but in the best of way. At least I was entertained. And shame on me, I forgot most of the stuff that happened. When I was reading Shadowfever for the second time, I couldn\u2019t remember much. Except for Mac and Barrons\u2019 hot scenes. Oh, brain, you have such a way of selecting relevant information. I loved how the story evolved. Now that the future two Fever books are set in stone, I\u2019m not so bothered by the ending anymore. At least I\u2019m hoping that my questions will be answered. Mac was great, even though she became a bit too suicidal for my taste. Yes, I do see her \u201cfuck you I\u2019m badass\u201d attitude as suicidal. She had a death wish, that\u2019s for sure. Barrons was an ass 80% of the time and pissed me off constantly. He did make up for it at the end. Kind of. I used to have more positive feelings for him. The second time I went through the series they significantly decreased. I still admire the sonovabitch though. V\u2019lane. Haha. V\u2019lane. How to put it nicely? I FUCKING TOLD YOU SO! Did you listen? No, of course you didn\u2019t. The Dreamy Eyed Guy (DEG) was one of my favorites. I had a suspicion that he was (view spoiler) [[part of]The Unseelie King (hide spoiler) ] but I wasn\u2019t expecting him to be so \u2013 what\u2019s the word? \u2013 pleasant. I\u2019m curious to see if he\u2019ll appear in the future books. I sure hope so. Christian was also great. I hope he ends up hooking up with Dani. I really see this happening. But first, let Dani get a bit older. It\u2019s kind of disturbing right now, when she\u2019s so young. Rowena got what she deserved. Ryodan was weird. Oh, and I also loved K\u2019Vruck.

He cools her fever.\" I've been asked many times what my favorite book is, but I don't think I've ever answered that question adequately enough. After reading this book, though, I think I finally have my answer: Shadowfever is the best book I've ever read. The book starts off exactly where the previous one left off, with Mac stunned after killing the beast. The first 5 or so chapters are heart-wrenching to read because KMM is such an awesome writer. I love how tangible Mac's pain is, it almost made me cry myself. But among the bleakness comes a certain chapter from a certain other character, and I swear, my heart sang , I was so happy. After that, no situation was enough to get me down for the rest of the book. About the characters: Mac is freakin' amazing! I can't believe how well she dealt with whatever was thrown her way, when I know I would have committed suicide just a few chapters in. But she kept at it, and eventually developed into the second-strongest heroine I've ever come across in my novels. Dani is also pretty awesome in her own right. I see lots of potential in her, and I loved the chapters from her perspective. A huge twist regarding her, but I have my fingers crossed for a spin-off series featuring her and Christian. And Barrons...*sigh*, where to start? There's way too much to say about this complex man, but suffice it to say that after reading about him, all other heroes fall miserable short of accomplishing the \"Tall, Dark, and Handsome\" persona. \"Dying is overrated. Human sentimentality has twisted it into the ultimate act of love. Biggest load of bullshit in the world. Dying for someone isn\u2019t the hard thing. The man that dies escapes. Plain and simple. Game over. End of pain. Alina was the lucky one. Try living for someone. Through it all\u2014good, bad, thick, thin, joy, suffering. That\u2019s the hard thing.\" The plot was epic . I think in the ten-or-so plot twists in this book, I only foresaw about one. Which is HUGE and half the reason I love this series so much. The ending left me speechless, ecstatic, and about a million types of happy. It was an open ending, the kind that wraps up the plot but still leaves lots of stuff for us imaginative types to go on. For all of you who have read the previous books in the series and can't imagine a HEA ending whatsoever: it's true what Mac said in the beginning, she does hold a lot of joy by the end. So keep reading, because it's worth every second!

I have read so many books, specially paranormal and UF! And this is still my fav of them all. I have adored this series since book 1. I'm ashamed to admit I was terrified I wouldn't like this book for several reasons, specially because Barrons could not be much in it.I don't wanna write any spoilers so all I can say is that this book was everything I wanted it to be, but what I liked the most was that it kept real to what the other books had been. There was not a freaking lame ending, things ended just exactly how they had to. What I adored the most about this series was the way the books were written, KMM has such an amazing and unique style and you just can't help to love it. Now that I am finally done with the series I can say it is still my top fav and I adored every page in every book. For all of those who have been waiting for book 5 to get released before starting the series, start right away because you're gonna adore it. Am I sad because it's over? Hell yeah, but at the same time I love an author who knows when to finish a series. I hate when series go on and on and you know they should have finished so many books ago. This was the perfect ending and KMM did it with style, she created a piece of art. This series is just too good to be true, she created a new world because it's so much more than books! ...more First Re-read: December 2014 Actual Rating: All the Bloody Stars Intensely Masculine Fucking Cataclysm Constant Jackass Tireless Lover Without Limit Stormy Night Absolute Jericho Sexual Winter Carnal JZB He exists in a place that is beyond all rules for me.

Somewhere along book #2 or #3 you stop being a serious, respectable and admirable woman. You give yourself to the biggest jackass in the history of UF and you enjoy very single second of it. What can I say to convince you to read this book I haven't already said? In my first read, I was so obsessed by the question what is Barrons? I couldn't properly appreciate the compelling writing, the amazing world-building and KMM's great execution. This time, I relaxed and enjoyed the view. And by view, I mean Barrons. The best part of this Re-read, and I completely mean it, is the Best Fever Buddy Read in the history and an amazing bunch of new friends I found there. Things got pretty crazy over there. One minute we were discussing the how's and why's and then BAM! the next thing you know we've got a whole thread reserved for Barron's hotness only ^^ We're reading Iced on Dec 22. I'm ready for some Dani and Ryodan! ______________________________________ First Read: November 2013 *Spoiler Free* This is a note for everybody out there who hasn't read this series yet: First of all, how dare you? You know, there's a moment in life when you find the best series you've read so far. And you can't let it go without freaking out, big time. You find people as crazy as you, you look for more reading material and even faint with the news of TWO more books. I should know, it happened to me. I've just found THE BEST FREAKING UF SERIES I'VE EVER READ and for that I'll always worship KMM. I will because reasons. And no, the reason is not Barrons. I won't lose the respect I've earn among GR's friends just saying that Barrons' body (view spoiler) [and #literalmagicpenis (hide spoiler) ] is the reason for 5 stars. I won't even mention that since I started this series I've been having this crazy dreams that always begins with Barrons saying \"Hello, Miss Liz. Who am I?\". Stop thinking I've been googling my personal Barrons in the web frustrated because they are not dark enough, intense enough, flawless enough. And if by some chance I'd have finally found my Barrons I wouldn't admit anything about my mobile's wallpaper. I guess I'm trying to say that there are more than just one reason this series is so epic. And that's KMM. She is a freaking genius that planned the whole series before she even began to write it, unlike some others writers. You can tell they were just improvising there. \"Hell, let's kill the MC in the most anticlimactic way ever just to see what happens! The plot? ...right, I'll figure it out later!\" \"I wrote a fanfic a while ago. Fuck it, I'm using it for an ENDLESS series. There could be a prequel, a sequel and a sequel's prequel!\" While reading this series I knew I'd have to re-read it as soon as possible because obviously KMM was a teaser, an evil woman who enjoyed watching me in pain and when all hope was lost, when all the lights had faded she gave me +500 pages of delicious ambrosia and I loved every. Single. Moment. Of it. (view spoiler) [Barrons and a barbecue? Guys, my love life is screwed for ever. I won't ever be happy so I'll just accept it and move on.

Totally mindblown. This is me right now. A thrilling, huge, conclusion to this series. So many questions were finally answered from the beginning of the series that I loved discovering everything as things were slowly making sense and the twists were amazing, and I'm so happy I read this series this month. It was exactly what I wanted to read when I didn't know what to read. Wow. Epic. I am going to make this spoiler free so it may be vague and it may not be very insightful. Also, I'll probably come back later on and write a better review so I won't feel bad adding spoilers then. But now, it's just too new for me to spoil it. Whew. I think that this was a great book. It took me through Mac's highs and lows, it pushed me and pulled me in so many different directions I began to feel like the Sinsar Dubh was this book and it has not only been stalking me, but my friends Wow. Epic. I am going to make this spoiler free so it may be vague and it may not be very insightful. Also, I'll probably come back later on and write a better review so I won't feel bad adding spoilers then. But now, it's just too new for me to spoil it. Whew. I think that this was a great book. It took me through Mac's highs and lows, it pushed me and pulled me in so many different directions I began to feel like the Sinsar Dubh was this book and it has not only been stalking me, but my friends as well, for the past year. I also want to mention that Barrons said \"not to believe anything was dead until I'd burned it, poked around in its ashes, then waited a day or two to see if anything rose from them.\" The only thing I didn't like was Mac's over-analyzing herself to no end. Literally it started when the Beast died and didn't end until the book did. That wouldn't bother me except Mac would say that she was done labeling herself, didn't need a label for others...and then she'd start wondering who she was. Again. And she'd figure herself out, for a while, and go back to trying to figure out who/what she was. The only thing that made it work, is that Mac was conscious of doing it. But back to the actual book. Wow. I had several WTF?! moments. And OMG moments, and I think a lot of questions were answered...But a lot of questions were brought up as well. I know 2 things: 1) The next series will be set in the Fever world...the NEW Fever world. 2) the title of that series was in Shadowfever. I don't know who (I thought it was Christian MacKeltar) and I never saw anything that jumped out and screamed \"title\" at me. If anyone knows, PLEASE tell me! The ending was a good ending for Mac...and a bit of a non-ending for the Fever world. I'm assuming that it will lead into the next series for the unknown main character (who I still think is Christian-there were just too many unknowns with him). V'Lane- ummm...never saw that coming. Barrons- saw that coming Mac- WTF moment! That's what she is?! I had NO CLUE!!! Dani- Wow...that, well, wow. didn't see that coming either. Mini spoiler: Adam Black, Daegus, Drustan, Cian and Christopher MacKeltar are in this one. Adam Black...sigh... expected more from him though And I'll leave you with this: Instead of THE END typed at the bottom of the last page, it says: The End... and the next page says ...for now... ETA: this is from KMM's website: ... I may find myself at some point in the future, dying to re-visit the Highlands again and totally in the mood to lose myself in love for no other purpose than love's sake. I guess the answer is: no plans to write a straightforward Highlander romance right now but I never say never. Remember, the Keltars figure prominently in the Fever series, and Christian will be getting his own play--just not the way I did it in my Highlander series. I need a little more nitty, gritty reality in his tale. He's becomes quite the complex man. http://www.demonloversbooksandmore.co... ...more Everything comes down to this and KMM made this so epic, so unbelievably good that I knew I had to take my time reading this.

MacKayla Lane is one of my favourites UF heroines! Her narration is so unique and distinctly hers that I find any other changes in the POV to be annoying (No offence, Dani). I just get so into Mac\u2019s head that reading from another POV throws me off. I adore her courage and her resiliency. Despite the fact that who she thought she was in the past was all wrong, she still stays true to herself in the most important ways. And I couldn\u2019t ask for more in a heroine. Mac kicks ass! Barrons , you infuriating man! Sometimes I just want to maul him for being so incredibly secretive, but then later I always find myself giving in and loving him despite his mysterious ways. His beast explains his animal magnetism and makes him that much more irresistible. How Mac can keep her hands off him is a mystery to me! And his secret? I didn\u2019t see that coming AT ALL. It\u2019s no wonder he kept it all under wraps this entire time! And my girl Dani ! I fecking lost it when I found out that she was Alina\u2019s murderer! What the hell. A murderer. At thirteen. All because of that stupid bitch, Rowena. I\u2019ve always hated this old hag. Manipulating Dani was the last straw for me. Die, bitch Die! What KMM does is crazy! You think Mac is talking to Isla, her \"MOTHER\" but no, she\u2019s Ro \u2013 ha! Gotcha! It\u2019s the Sinsar Dubh! My head is still reeling from all this. I couldn\u2019t possibly understand this world even if I wanted to. Then all this time I hated LM for all the shit that he caused. For Mac\u2019s rape, for supposedly killing Alina. But he really did love Alina, didn\u2019t he? That was another thing I loved about this book. There was heart and hope even through all the dark times. Mac\u2019s grief in the beginning is enough to bring on the tears. Then there\u2019s V\u2019lane /Cruce - *rubs temples* And Christian - I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see him again in the new series. Please let it be about him! PLEASE! Lots of unanswered questions with him... But most of all, the Fever world is what captivated me from the beginning. So intensely mysterious and alluring, I found myself mesmerized by KMM\u2019s worldbuilding. I would say I\u2019d love to live in this world, but I really don\u2019t. I\u2019m way too chickenshit to live a second in Mac\u2019s shoes. Nevertheless, I\u2019m saddened to have Mac\u2019s journey end...for now. But I will definitely be picking up this series again and again! STAY TO THE LIGHTS! ...more I must apologize in advance, because you\u2019re about to read mostly gushing and my experience reading this more than a summary of this story.

I\u2019m one of the obsessed now. This review is for the unabridged audio version, which I highly recommend! I had been listening to Dreamfever (book 4) on the way to work and finished. What an ending! But it wasn\u2019t until I popped in the first CD of Shadowfever that I realized what had actually happened at the end of Dreamfever and I almost had a heart attack! I had to go into work and as I was walking in, I purchased the Kindle version on my phone so I could sneak peeks during breaks, because I was so tortured! When I got home I speed read/skimmed the rest of the book just to make sure everything was going to turn out okay. Once I climbed off the ledge, I was able to relax and then listen to the rest without worries. Shadowfever is a LONG book. Approximately 688 pages, but I loved each and every one of them. I loved feisty and self-confident Mac, and with each book we make new discoveries about her identity and her powers. We see her grow from Mac 1.0: innocent, sheltered, lover of all things pink and glittery, to Mac 2.0: strong, powerful, and ready to take on any challenge. Jericho Barrons was larger than life and everything you could want in an oh-so-delicious, dark hero. Their relationship is, of course, my favorite part of this series, and it starts off on shaky ground when Shadowfever begins. They repair, bit by bit, opening up, and pulling each other in closer and closer with every interaction. They have off-the-charts chemistry: The moment I laid eyes on you, I knew you were trouble.\" \"Ditto.\" \"I wanted to drag you between the shelves, f%&k you senseless, and send you home.\" \"If you'd done that, I never would have left.\" \"You're still here anyway.\" \"You don't have to sound so sour about it.\" \"You're upsetting my entire existence.\" \"Fine, I'll leave.\" \"Try and I'll chain you up.\u201d There were gripping plot twists that surprised, saddened, and enraged me. We finally find out who killed Alina, and it was a shocker. We get answers about the book, who originally let it out, why Barrons wants it, what he is, and who the Unseelie King is. I was happy with the way things ended and tied up, but apparently after three books revolving around Dani, we get more with Mac and Barrons. Like I said before, I listened to this on audio CDs while I commuted back and forth to work. I had to try and restrict myself to just listening to it then, but when the holiday came, I could no longer resist and finished Shadowfever on my computer while following along on my Kindle. I feel like the audio increased my pleasure immensely. The narrator switched mid series, and at first there was a woman doing all of the voices. The last two books are narrated by a male and female and while it took me a bit to get used to the switch in Mac\u2019s voice, Jericho\u2019s voice was amazing, deep, sexy, and oh-so-perfect! See, I told you pretty much just gushing. All I can say is, if you haven\u2019t read this series, go now! Favorite Quote: \u201cHe pulls me around and kisses me.\"You're Mac,\" he says. \"And I'm Jericho. And nothing else matters. Never will. You exist in a place that is beyond all rules for me. Do you understand that?\" I do. Jericho Barrons just told me he loves me.\u201d You can read this review and more at The Readers Den. ...more 5 WHY-IS-IT-OVER?!

STARS Book Love; as defined by The Vampire Ninja: To fall into the pages of a book so entirely that your whole body weeps and soars with the characters moods, to entirely forget that you have a life of your own outside of its pages. Dear Diary, I just read the MOST amazing story!! I haven\u2019t felt this sort of eclipsing joy over a series since I was 19 and I first read L.J. Smith\u2019s Dark Visions trilogy. And as with that story, which just connected with all the emotions vying for supremacy in my young mind \u2013 a mind newly embracing herself as the woman she had become despite horrific history, this book has settled itself into my heart and I have no intention of yarding it back out. I think we all fall in love with books because they were exactly what we needed to read at the time. The FEVER series was exactly what I needed to read right now. This is series all about shades of gray. About being what you NEED to be to survive, not just exist but TRULY survive, a life that is entirely different than the one you thought you would be living. It is a series that is so interwoven that the moments in this book reach back and claim the moments experienced in previous books. To the many Jericho Barrons fangirls I must say that I am not one of you, I am firmly of the mindset that we would never work out together. However, I did LOVE him for Mac. Speaking of which, Mac is now \u2013 and will liking always be \u2013 my homegirl. I love that girl, and her growth over these five books was amazing and heart-wrenching to experience. These books were just what I needed. The frenzy, the mania, that kept me turning page after page, being bombarded with emotion after emotion, is something I won\u2019t soon forget. I love how this final book in MacKayla\u2019s story wove all the pieces from all four previous books together and left a gorgeous tapestry of love and misery, pain and impossibility. This story reminded me of why I first fell in love with reading. I\u2019m sure The Beast will be happy to have me back in the land of the living, where he doesn\u2019t have to shove a fork in my hand and food in front of my face to make sure I still eat. I must say that I will miss it, though. Goodbye, Mac\u2026. Until we meet again! I suppose it\u2019s past time to do some laundry and clean the suite. A big thank you to all you FEVER FREAKS for bombarding my page with likes and comments, and a special thank you to Cory for convincing me to give this poorly-shelved-in-my-bookstore series a chance! \u2665 ...more", "Title": "Shadowfever"},
