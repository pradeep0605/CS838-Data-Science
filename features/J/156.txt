Whatever they call it, it leaps over anything, takes the biggest chair, the largest slice, rules the ground wherever it walks, from a mansion to a swamp, and its selfishness is its beauty.\u201d \u2013 Toni Morrison, <+++>Love</+++> It\u2019s almost September and I\u2019ve managed to keep my Morrison-a-month reading streak alive. Eight Morrison\u2019s later and she never fails to surprise me, even though these are rereads. I enjoyed Love , a well-written book with a lot of fodder for discussion. The strange thing is I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard anyone mention it. I wonder why it doesn\u2019t have the same appeal as some of her other books? Love begins with our narrator introducing us to the coast community the book is set in; she talks about the past in nostalgic tones, how things have changed, and how things haven\u2019t changed. The main story itself is centered around the legend Bill Cosey, a black entrepreneur, and the women in his life who fight for his attention: his (very) young wife, daughter-in-law, grand-daughter and a few others. Even though Cosey has been deceased for a couple of decades, he is still a very strong, disturbing presence in the lives of these women. This is a sad story of misunderstandings, bitterness, cruelty, hurt and anger. The three women share a house and we aren\u2019t sure why there is so much hatred between them. Morrison reveals things slowly and in a non-linear manner, and I\u2019m left wondering how on earth women\u2019s lives can be fulfilling if they are centred solely around men, especially when this competition is encouraged, which, in this book, resulted in very strong feelings: \u201cHate does that. Burns off everything but itself, so whatever your grievance is, your face looks just like your enemy\u2019s.\u201d \u201cFinally they stopped, moved into acid silence, and invented other ways to underscore bitterness\u2026.Like friendship, hatred needed more thank physical intimacy; it wanted creativity and hard work to sustain itself.\u201d When it comes to Morrison\u2019s writing, what stands out to me most are her descriptions of things, in particular how she uses colour; it\u2019s often a short poetic respite from the tough subject matter she writes: \u201cJade and sapphire waves fight each other, kicking up enough foam to wash sheets in. An evening sky behaves as though it\u2019s from another planet\u2013 one without rules, where the sun can be plum purple if it wants to and clouds can be red as poppies.\u201d This was an emotional whirlwind of a book and Morrison takes us in so many different directions, down many paths of discoveries. There is plenty of food for thought in this one: families, their secrets and their hurts. \u201cThe problem for those left alive is what to do about revenge\u2013how to escape the sweetness of its rot. So you can see why families make the best enemies. They have time and convenience to honey-butter the wickedness they prefer.<---F> Shortsighted, though</---F>.\u201d ...more Women clawing at and after the same man is a horrific thing to see, but hella fun to read!

Maybe \"fun\" isn't the perfect word to describe Toni Morrison's Love .* This is Faulknerian, not only in its language and flow, but its molasses-thick-and-dark emotional resonance. Love is like seeing a feminine take on Absalom! Absalom! : a beautifully shadowy Southern power; a corrupting energy that devours good souls. An aloof man of substantial means in a Floridian coastal town of decades past is the sun around which competing planets revolve. These planets are women of various backgrounds all with some claim upon the man's radiant energy. Their world turns toxic as the reader witnesses the evils of too much radiation. These off-tilt and colliding friends are ripped apart, scorched whenever they come in contact with their beloved sun. Morrison is a master at her craft, an absolute pleasure to read for those who can stomach a non-linear storytelling style. She will come at her topic at multiple angles. You must put the pieces together. Never fear, by the end this amoebic puzzle will come together in a portrait that is gorgeous, enlightening and heartbreaking. Love is life confirming, even if life can feel like one long, extended death. * Perhaps it's not a good way to describe ANY of her books! I could be wrong, I haven't read them all, but jeez louise the woman writes some deep, depressing stuff! ...more Ovo je fenomenalno i briljantno napisana knjiga...

No, stil pisanja je toliko prekrasan i ne znam s kojim bih ga sad mogla usporediti. Osjecaj je kao da sam procitala knjigu poezije i sad mi je bice na miru neko vrijeme. Najveci paradoks u cijeloj prici je sto se ona sastoji od uzasnih dijelova i ostavlja bas gorak okus. To mi se dogadalo i s Cestom, knjiga koja izaziva tjeskobu i uzas, a u isto vrijeme, ima li ista ljepse? Okosnica radnje je Bill Cosey, vlasnik ljetovalista i pripadnih postratne afroamericke srednje klase, koji je unatoc tome sto je mrtav vec 25 godina i dalje glavni pokretac radnje i svih gotickih, poremecenih odnosa medu likovima...

To malo prijateljstvo pretvara se u dozivotnu, patolosku mrznju... Nakon smrti ostavlja hotel koji se iz luksuznog mjesta pretvara u gotovo kazalisnu rusevinu i podlogu scenama kakvih se ni Henry James ne bi posramio. Ostali likovi sluze kako bi oslikali prilike u kojima se afroamericko stanovnistvo nalazilo, a posebno mjesto zauzima lik Mlade koja se pojavljuje u nekoj verziji sluskinje (kao sto u svim juznjackim romanima, sluskinja obicno i jest centralni lik koja je naratorica obiteljske povijesti), a ovdje je simbolom neceg demonskog i izravan medij i poveznica mrtvog Coseya sa svijetom zivih.

I often found myself going back and rereading passages to figure out relationhips amongst the characters. It wasn't until I reached page 107 or so that the book either started to flow, or my mind was clear enough to understand. That \"aha\" moment was like a breath of fresh air and redeemed Ms. Morrison as one of my all time favorite authors. Love can mean different things to different people based on their relationship with the person or thing they are in love with. The premise of this book is the love between two childhood friends who are made to hate one another by the very adults whose guidance and affection they needed to survive. As most of us know, in order to hate, you must first love, and love conquers all, even hate. The problem is, hate consumes so much of us in terms of time, and energy. So here we have two childhood friends, taught to hate, and wasted lives that find them in a quandry some 50 years later, realizing that thier love for each other is stronger than their hate. Unfortunately, this realization comes too late (well not really in terms of forgiveness). Ms. Morrison's tale also deals with other social issues that probably unsettled many readers, but that is her writing style. Slavery, oppression, child molestation, self-hatred, it is all there, even the narration of a kindred spirit. The ending left me wanting more closure and June Viviane having some form of blood ties to Bill Cosey, her Good Man. Tracy L.

That moment may never come, so now I'm launching in and will come back to add more later. It wasn't until the end of the book that I began to understand the title in all its complexity. It feels as though Morrison is exploring ways in which love may be warped, corrupted, twisted; here ending mostly in hurt and hatred. The only exception to this is the tiny family unit of grandparents and grandson Romen, who are kind and decent people, offered perhaps as a small pool of light in what is a very dark tale. Interesting that I should need to use 'light' and dark' here as descriptors, tied as they are so often to skin colour, race and racism. The emotional territory of this book was so terrible that I struggled to read it, kept having to put it down and go away. It was a Book Club read, so I knew I needed to keep going, and I wanted to understand more about why Morrison had written it. A quick bit of research in the University Library catalogue took me to a string of titles like these: (and here I will now have to find my notes) ...more ?? I'm not too sure I know what I read.

Thankfully, the author didn't go into detail regarding the relationship between the old man and the 11 year old or I would not have finished reading the book. Well, the old man dies and leaves the resort to an unnamed girl, whom each woman in his life assumes it's themselves who is the benefactor. Thus the plot ensues. What I found quite difficult with Love is that it read much like a riddle and I often found myself re-reading paragraphs, if not whole chapters, trying to figure out who the author is talking about, where it fits in the story and why. Very frustrating. However, now that the story is done, it's actually an interesting story. I just wish it was easier to read. ...more The worlds of Toni Morrison are rarely beautiful places.

And when I put one of her books down for the first time, it calls me back into in immediately. I can't wait to re-read Love . And like all Morrison novels, it actually requires re-reading. In the lively spirit of William Faulkner, Morrison entangles readers in a web of characters and events, leading them through the side door, back door, upstairs window, the cracks in the floorboard of every plotline, and ultimately leaves us all dizzy. Love certainly requires the patient reader, but it rewards us with a story that echoes like dream, resonates like myth. I don't think there is a better author alive today who can capture the profundity of human experience. She, like no other, can leave readers believing that our lives are so much bigger than we could ever know. The characters' pain, their grief, their relationships, their families, their mistakes, their love are so profound they practically walk in the flesh amongst the characters themselves. And that's the power of Love , a large, profound story told in just over 200 pages, with its ability to puzzle and haunt and leave us breathless. Amid the wounds that have broken and sometimes perverted these characters, Morrison proves that genuine love is above all the most extraordinary aspect of our human experience: the love between friends (Christine/Heed) and the love given unasked from gentle warriors--the book's \"heroes,\" one man [Romen:] and one woman [L:]. And that love, when lost, when misplaced, when misdirected, when perverted, can damage irrevocably--as embodied by the symbolic end of the Cosey family tree itself. ...more There are so many quotes in this book that I want to write down and remember forever.

Every character's story is told from various perspectives, not always in order. while this makes the book a little confusing and hard to follow at times, it's worth sticking with, as all becomes clear by the end of this beautifully written jewel box of a novel. Just when you are ready to judge a character's actions, or form an opinion about their character, you see them from another angle, told in a different character's voice, which given you an entirely different insight into their motives and character. It's a story that requires patience; that doesn't judge, but rather asks you to watch, wait, and learn empathy by understanding the history of each character. Now that I am finished with the book, I plan to read it again, as the story has so many layers, and insights, that I think it would get better with each read. ...more Holy hell.

After it fills the cemetery, it strengthens whoever survives; helps them to know the difference between a strong mind and a healthy one; between the righteous and the right--which is, after all, progress. The problem for those left alive is what to do about revenge--how to escape the sweetness of its rot. So you can see why families make the best enemies. Not many authors could live up to that. But Toni does. Love explores a history of a neighborhood, a country, a race, a family, several lives, all bound to one another\u2019s selves and histories with an an intensity that is born of love and nourished by hatred. Heed (full name Heed the Night) and Christine are old ladies in a house inherited from a common patriarch. Which one of them is the true heir is ambiguous, but neither will let go either of the house or of the bitterness, either about their situation or toward one another. Into the scene comes one of those characters--girls--that Morrison loves. Junior Viviane (\u201cWith and \u201ce.\u201d Are you loving the names?)--she won\u2019t let anyone call her June--drops seemingly out of nowhere, in the scene she is, but not of it, outside any human or natural law, and born to sow turmoil wherever she lands. Now, again, this is Morrison, so we know to expect the supernatural, or spiritual voices. And we get them. Truth? I\u2019m not sure who one or two of them are. But the voices are haunting and truthful and guide us through the vortex of time and emotion back to the beginning of all this period that the book covers. Little by little, of course. We learn nothing all at once. it wouldn\u2019t be good for us, like looking on the face of God. When our two hundred page journey is done, and this portion of the story is played out as much as it\u2019s going to be this time around, we\u2019re left with that Morrison feeling that we\u2019re walking out of a fantasy into some foreign place--call it daylight--where the edges are sharp, things are what they seem, and facts are solid as stone. During the journey, however, nothing has quite made sense and, yet, everything did. It was awful for a fifty-plus man to marry himself off to an eleven-year-old girl. But you understood it. It wasn\u2019t right, but you understood it. No way out here in the sunlight it can be contemplated, let alone forgiven. You had to be there. Same with half the stuff Junior does. We\u2019re glad to find a steadying influence like Sandler in the neighborhood, but too much of him would get in the way of the story, and it\u2019s the story that matters as much as the living. And that may be the Morrison Nobel point. The story, the myth, the tale, is as important as the living of it, may even determine the living, and in turn the telling, of it. And like the line about not knowing the dancer from the dance, you in the end may not know the person from his story, or one from the other.

I kept picturing the absent figure sitting at a table lecturing everybody about their sorry behavior. Some of Morrison's familiar (and worth chewing over for many books, I mean) themes appear, like the taming of wild women, obsession/misogyny in female friendships, people who see but don't say, the price and benefits of respectability. The answer-to-the-riddle character comes up way too late, in my read, and the story sits halfway between resolved closure whodunit style (which is one kind of stance on the title), and melancholia (which is another), and I also couldn't figure out whether it was the story of a utopia (the seaside resort where African American bohemians could go to cut loose), or the story of a failed bohemia (ditto, but with some personal unravelling and pathology as well). So, in the end, I wasn't sure how she was trying to arrange personal and political, or whether they were meant to be arranged, or merely regarded. She does hunger, of all kinds, well, as usual. And the description of spaces, and the multiple times in which people inhabit them (including the space of one's head). The switchbacks of narration and alignments, personal, financial and familial, I found compelling, but it all did seem like a lot of fuss about a very uncompelling \"empty center.\" ...more This is a meticulously structured, very well-written book.

I've had this sitting on my book shelf for years but it never grabbed me every time I tried to read it. But, I finally did and it was quite an interesting tale. Not my favorite but how the book showed three different generations of women experiencing love was very intriguing. Read for a group read. Not my usual genre. Past and present are interwoven into the narrative. I found it a bit confusing at times to follow who was narrating and found the ending a bit unbelievable. It did leave me yearning for a classic!

Stretch out your hands. Grab the palms of Toni Morrison. She takes you to Silk, to the \u2018Cosey Hotel\u2019. The scent of cinnamons. Something citrus. You\u2019ve been here before. But the company is definitely more interesting this time. Set in the 1990s,\u2019Love\u2019 is the story of the Late Bill Cosey, owner of \u2018The Cosey Resort\u2019, who is hemmed into the lives of the women around him, through love, or rather its betrayal. Cosey is dead by the time the novel opens, but Morrison dexterously resurrects him through 5 Black women, who serve more or less as sifting agents. I say \u2018sifting\u2019 because we distil out Bill Cosey\u2019s image through them. The five Cosey women, his daughter-in-law May, a bit looney, convinced that the abolitionists are out to burn down the resort, Cosey\u2019s granddaughter Christine, his widow and Christine\u2019s playmate Heed, suffering from arthritis in old age, confident that Christine is out to rob her future just like she ripped her past , the girl with merged toes -Junior, newly out of Correctional and Heed\u2019s aid-of-sorts, and L, cook, Cosey\u2019s friend, and the primary narrator. Bill Cosey, the son of a court-house informer, owns the \u2018Cosey resort\u2019, a haven of sorts for the Black bourgeoisie. After his wife\u2019s death, he marries 11-years-old Heed, his granddaughter\u2019s friend. The pedophilia is excused by the Silk community for marriage makes it socially acceptable, and surprisingly to some extent understood by the reader. The marriage destroys Heed and Christine\u2019s friendship, an animosity sets in. With time, the business goes downhill, Bill Cosey dies, leaving behind all his possessions to \u201cmy sweet Cosey child\u201d- ranting of a whiskey-whipped mind. The problem I guess becomes that there\u2019s too much of space in the lives of 11-year-olds. Perhaps if there wasn\u2019t, Bill Cosey wouldn\u2019t have taken so much room. It feels like a loop, really. The two vie for Cosey\u2019s attention before his death, and after his death, they struggle to prove themselves as the \u201cCosey child\u201d - battling on, \u201cas though they were champions instead of sacrifices\u201d. At the heart of all relationship problems, not just romantic, lies the inability to articulate. At the age of 12, Christine sees her grandfather masturbating to her 11-year-old friend. That\u2019s a profoundly disturbing image for us to live with, let alone a 12-year-old. It\u2019 like something deep inside you lets go of its anchor. An expensive lifestyle cannot atone for such a stigma. And perhaps the most poignant thing about the story is this- the friendship that is lost because of their inability to convey to each other the trauma of that experience. It becomes a relationship punctuated by ellipses. Reading Toni Morrison is an extremely exhilarating experience. She demands participation from the reader, and though it\u2019s highly rewarding, she loses out on narrative coherence at times. She wants you to be constantly alert to every belch and groan, which makes it feel like she\u2019s tantalizing the reader. Just flipping through the pages is not an alternative here. Morrison takes her characters, chops their stories into pieces, and scatters the fragments all through the novel, slowly revealing them through a variety of sources. You can never be assured of the accuracy of the impressions you make of the characters. The reader is left to constantly revise his theories. I\u2019m not saying that her characters are unrealistic. It\u2019s just that their reality is so distressing, that you don\u2019t want to imagine it. Morrison reduces the whole novel to a single tone. That of agony. If shame could be fleshed, and clothed in vice, it would be called Bill Cosey. Along with the hotel, he inherits the guilt of betraying his community from his father. I don\u2019t want to call him the central character, because Bill Cosey is not a mere speck around whom the novel is drawn. He is the circle himself. I would have never thought I\u2019d sympathise him, but I did. The lack of villains is actually a bit troubling. They are all victims. You keep on arduously looking for someone to blame. In this respect, the novel can also be looked at as a critic of the individual success of Blacks at the expense of their ancestry. Of the lot though, 16-years-old Romen, the Coseys\u2019 errand-guy, appealed to me the most. We come across him for the first time recovering from a fight with his chums over his having helped a gang-rape victim escape. I wouldn\u2019t say that he\u2019s a saint. He\u2019s not delivering a sermon, but he\u2019s not exactly sneering either. In a novel which moves from darkness to darkness, you hold on to him for all that is pure about the world. He is like Dostoyevsky\u2019s Aloysha. He is hope. He\u2019s pure. He trembles on the edge of priggishness, but is mercifully saved from tumbling right over. If we are defined by what we seek, then Morrison\u2019s characters are not very different from us. They look for love, in the wrong places though. 250 pages later I ended up thinking that perhaps life would be all rosy if love could be sought with a conscious desire for it. \u201cTo love, softly, gently, without props.\u201d ...more Toni Morrison's \"Love\" seems like a misnomer when considered against the ghastly concerns of the slim novel.

Christine's mother, May, is also a force to be contended with, as she joins in (and instigates) the fray. Add to the mix a young stranger with a shady past and dubious intentions, Junior (or June for short), and we have an inter-generational cast of women who fall under the spell of Bill Cosey, within and after his lifetime. Conventional enough. But as Morrison leads the reader into the narrative, little morsels are served and our views about the characters are constantly challenged and we reevaluate them. That Cosey is not just a black man but a rich owner of Cosey's Resort in depression-era Atlanta reveals an interesting take on power and race issues. That his bride Heed was his granddaughter's best friend and that he had practically yanked an 11 year-old into an illicit marriage raises concerns about child rape and the perversity of Bill Cosey. But the novel is not about him; it is about the women who deal with their relationships with him and how that informs their relationships with each other. Morrison's novels are never easy to read (at least for this reader) and the density of her prose and deeply incisive writing bears re-reading to harvest the wealth of all she is saying. There is an orality to her writing that invites you to actually hear (and see) the characters as they speak, especially in L's narrative, which takes on the blend of folklore surrounding \"Policeheads\" that drown immoral and errant women off the beach and the history about the women and the Resort, which blur into one another, and in the end offers up more questions than answers to the narrative. ...more I've been a fan of Toni Morrison for a while so I don't know why I expected a typical story of women fighting for the love and property of a man but I did and, of course, that is not what I got.

I also got a study in rape culture and how it divides families, friends, communities, and movements. Love also explores the class and ideological tensions within the Black community. Somehow Morrison also finds time in this short novel to examine the idea of the hyper masculinity that stifles the growth of young Black men as they try to reconcile what's expected of them in terms of manhood and the humanity and sensitivity that lies beneath the posturing. Reading Morrison's novels is always a visceral experience for me because she is so great at painting pictures of all the ugly parts of being a human and having to deal with the damage other humans wreak. I often find her work to be quite creepy and I have to be in a certain mood to read her because she's exceptional at taking you into the hearts of her characters and the terror/trauma of their experiences. Major trigger warning for child abuse and rape though. Because of her ability to put you in the room with her characters I can see this being a trauma inducing read for some. It could also be a cathartic read for others as the ending brings closure for the characters and for the readers. ...more This review is being written after my first read...I am a Toni Morrison Fan that rereads her books at least twice.

Just a brilliant examination of how women are forced into situations by men who want to control them and take away their agency and autonomy. I really loved the story the second time through. It's such a tragic, bittersweet, disturbing story about their desperate love for a man, and his dismissal of them, when they really only needed each other.
