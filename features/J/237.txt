(Thanks Michelle for telling me the name of this hot dude) Re-read: Amazon sent me a letter to update the book. Love it EVEN more the second time. First and foremost. I DON'T WANT IT TO END! I WANT MORE PLEASE!!!!! Thank you Mya Roberts for writing this beautiful, epic LOVE STORY. Now the theme itself is so HORRIFYING that for a while I debated whether I wanted to read the book or not. Usually rape is not something I want to read. In fact I read the reviews of the V girl first before reading and most of them were accurate, rape is not something that we get to see graphically . I can't stand rape. I just can't. But the INTELLIGENT, MATURE, ALMOST POETIC approach the author used to tackle this difficult topic was brilliant. There's rape, the blurb says as much but it's more than a menace, a threat to the people who live in this world. 90% of the book the story is more about the Heroine's fight,<---M> about her feelings</---M>, not about rape for the sake of bringing drama. Nothing like game of thrones style. It's sad to think that The V girl society is very realistic. I think our own society has come to accept rape and abuse as something that can't be avoided. From where we stand as society where rape culture is fed on us daily to the moment a society like this becomes a reality...i'm sad to think about it but it may happen. it seems like whenever there's war there's crime. Looting, Murder, torture, rape, slavery. Honestly just see what Hitler did. I'm sure his high comanders had green card to do whatever they wanted to the people they oppressed. Countless of TV shows, movies and books talk about torture and murder during war. They never talk about rape and that's sadly the reality every women of every country that has been invaded has to live. For them or for someone they know. There's PLOT YOU HEAR ME PLOT and subplots too. There's a good story here that made me cry, laugh, throw my kindle to the garbage (literally) swoon REPEATEDLY. Swoon? why? Because ALEKSEY FURST! A SOLDIER WHO DOES WHAT'S RIGHT! what the other soldiers should do. PROTECT PEOPLE and he wasn't expecting to fall in love with Lila but he did. It's a very difficult situation for this couple. On the one hand she FOR OBVIOUS REASONS hates soldiers. On the other hand IT'S PROHIBITED TO HAVE A FOREIGN AND AN AMERICAN getting married and the punishement is torture. (rape? no problem. Love? heaven forbid! how come?) But aleksey fights his way to get Lila's heart, he changes for her, he risks everything for her, and little by little she'll find that Aleksey is not her enemy. He's there to LOVE HER not to take advantage of the situation. Would he gain her heart and have the honor to be the one who deflowers the heroine? There's plenty of sex. yes but it's portrayed in a way that fits the plot perfectly. And when you reach the 85% mark you'll be ready to cry and soak your kindle. Its that dramatic. And what comes next is horrifying. But thanks god there's something that Roberts had in store for us that we weren't expecting. (view spoiler) [A HEA (hide spoiler) ] just when things looked to be going for the worst, just when I thought happiness wasn't possible, I learned that there's hope and I ended up smiling. It was so beautiful. Now a warning. The book is BRUTAL, HORRIFYING AND NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. It's super dark and for your sake if you're squimish I suggest you skim or even avoid chapters 53 and 54. I'll repeat AVOID CHAPTERS 53 AND 54 if you're squimish. They're brilliant but not for the faint of heart. Even so I think Roberts did a great job in presenting a scene like that only when was needed. She didn't overuse the horror of the situation to bring more drama. I think it was beautifully handled. I'm a fan and I'm recommending this book to everyone on my list.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more \u201cYou usually can\u2019t recall all the people you\u2019ve shared laughs with.

I\u2019ve shamelessly read this book twice, as well as my favorite parts a gazillion times, and each read felt as if it was the first. I don\u2019t know what it was about this book. Maybe the fact that it was simply different which gave it a fresh taste that tasted bitter at times. The events in the book had me pausing with disgust, horror, but it was balanced out with the action, love, intimacy \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t not love this read, even when at times I hated it. Set in an alternative world where rape is legal, expected and enjoyed we get the pleasure of meeting Lila whose on an emergency mission that needs to happen before recruitment. To be a virgin is like having AIDs \u2013 it\u2019s like a nuisance, and all Lila wants to do is get rid of that name people calls her: \u201cV-Girl\u201d . She\u2019s got a plan, which involves her, her best friend, someplace secluded with them butt naked. But even that proves to be more difficult than one would expect. You\u2019d think the hardest thing for a girl is to keep her virginity, but in Lila\u2019s case, it\u2019s the complete opposite and given the circumstances and the fucked up world she lives in? That\u2019s not a good thing at all. I really enjoyed the pace of this book. The way the author gives you a chance to get to know the characters, to identify who they were the same way they were figuring it out for themselves. I didn\u2019t feel like I was simply reading words put together. It was more like I was a fly on the wall, or the character\u2019s shadow. Like a shadow I had no choice but to follow, and like a fly on that wall, I pried and invaded their thoughts and actions. Everything was set perfectly, and with patience you\u2019d be greatly rewarded. ;) I really grew to love and respect Lila. The only thing that pissed me off was how fickle she was with her feelings at time. But on the other hand I understood her because the reality of the situation was acceptable. Her fear of being taken clouded everything else, and even though it may hurt my man in the process she was adamant in her decision. After witnessing such a disgusting act at such a young age, she\u2019d fight with nail and teeth to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen to her. And in a twisted way I kind of respected her for that. \"I\u2019m a natural born pessimist\" Lila would always think the worst, prep for it and deal with whatever outcome may arise. In that way she reminded me of me lol. Not to mention, again, that fucked up world she was in, forced to be the provider of the family \u2013 always putting them first without thinking about herself? That girl was far beyond her age and the struggles she went through, her confused heart, her sense of defeat and questioning her decisions? She never blamed them on anyone or whined about the circumstances. There were times when she and her 'too mature for her age' sister would be talking and the shit that little girl would say honestly fucking pissed me off and I was forced to give all my brownies to Lila because I\u2019d have snapped more times than need be :P **I forgot to mention that Lila's sister, no matter how old she may act. There was something that happened to her that completely shred her. The \"adult\" cape crumbled and she was that fragile girl beneath. But after being saved the chips slowly puzzled their way back together. That whole scene, as bad at it was it was tragically beautiful all the same. But I\u2019m rambling. I\u2019m trying to sound all coherent and fuck when really as I type I\u2019m drifting off to memories that I share with the awesome book :D Her first meeting with Aleksey who I might add is fucking sexy. In my mind\u2026that man? That fucking god sent man? Beautiful isn\u2019t he? He was a sexual force, all man and domination encompassed in a powerful, strikingly beautiful body *_* \u201cIf as we see nightfall, we become capable of accepting love, let\u2019s celebrate an alliance with our unbroken delusions. Who ever knew we would say goodbye to oblivion? Who ever knew we would accept hope?\u201d Dear author? If you publish Aleksey\u2019s journal, I\u2019d read it. Honestly\u2026I would o.o Aleksey? A poet? Gosh dammit. He\u2019s brooding, mysterious, always got a scowl on his face that I just wanna kiss away. His awesomeness doesn\u2019t end there. Not only does he have a filthy mouth that I love, he plays bass, he\u2019s also good with his tongue (and no \u2013 I mean other than his dirty talking ;3) I was intrigued from the moment I met him, and dear Lila was as well. :D I was thirsting for their interaction between each other, and as the fire slowly burn into a blazing flame I was right next to that fucking flame *_* I wanted them to happen from the moment they met. I\u2019m a forbidden whore and I knew they shouldn\u2019t be together but they NEEDED TO BE. Aleksey had this dominant way about him that made me puddle where I sat. I dreamed about that man for DAYS and I still do! The relationship like everything else flowed and built at a perfect pace. Their fight to deny each other \u2013 Aleksey\u2019s fight for accepting what he feels it\u2019s all he\u2019s able to accept. Man, what he went through broke my heart, but he didn\u2019t break. He was still strong and he was content. But Lila made him hope. I didn\u2019t like how she treated him at times, honestly I just wanted to hug him forever and play a little CN with him. *Le chuckles* \u201cHe doesn\u2019t make me feel like he\u2019s kissing me. He makes me feel like he owns me.\u201d Indeed he did. The first kiss \u2013 FINALLY \u2013 the long awaited kiss was like no other. Like damn \u2013 the author doesn\u2019t just write words \u2013 she writes spells that hypnotizes the reader and then the fucking feelings . I\u2019m becoming repetitive! Everything they encountered, by themselves or together \u2013 with others\u2026 It was just mind blowing. The dangers Lila got into, the way Aleksey is always there \u2013so aware\u2026I loved it all. When they finally became one\u2026 I was envious of Lila. That I was lol The sex: This book was well crafted. You got to know the minors and the not so minors as well. Everyone had the right amount of page time and it was enough to make this book magical. Even those that I hated got some love from me. The good guys weren\u2019t spared fuckery and I got teary eyed a couple times. The sacrifice at recruitment made me tsk in annoyance as I read on. Like, this book isn\u2019t no walk in the park, it\u2019s not simple bed of roses. The park is bumpy and full of unwanted obstacles, those bed of roses aren\u2019t red from natural colors. But believe me when I tell you that at the end of the road, you\u2019d be satisfied. Don\u2019t look at this as something that\u2019s supposed to be unrealistically\u2026.realistic. It gets to you, and with an open mind and a thirst for more, this read would be at the top of your fav list. The end of the journey - Lila accept the V reference, but it wasn't for being a virgin. It was for something far more fitting for who she was now. And right beside her was the man she fell unexpectedly in love with... the one who deserves her and deserves happiness on a whole. I honestly love how they were portrayed. I could literally see their actions playing out before me. This book was a moving slide show. :D I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m content. And with that knowledge.

Nothing of that \u2018use and discard\u2019 nonsense. And the boundaries should be well drawn beforehand. What is acceptable and what is not.\u201d ~ Lila To find the right partner, Lila embarks on an odyssey of sexual observation, introspection, and exploration. She examines and evaluates every nuance of her own sexuality, as well as that of others. The end result being: A vibrantly beautiful sexual awakening that changes her life in a spectacular way. Lila is a remarkable heroine: she isn\u2019t ruled by social norms, emotions, or hormones; she fights to control her own destiny; and, she refuses to let gender or sexuality determine her self-worth. She is, as her father puts it: \u201cHer own best-friend.\u201d ~ Dr. Baron Velez But the person most deserving of notice is Mya Robarts herself. In a time when most authors mass produce poorly written romances about virginal heroines who lose their hearts (and panties) to emotionally stunted manwhores with borderline personality disorders and multi-orgasmic (albeit robotic) sexual techniques; Robarts produced a ground-breaking commentary on the polychromatic nature of sexuality, and a heroine who not only knows where the consensual prism stops and the non-consensual mean-reds begin, but intellectualizes the physical, emotional, and psychological ramifications of both schematics. In short, Mya Robarts is purple. If you don\u2019t notice her, God will be pissed! Blue may indeed be sneaky , but The V-Girl is sneakier: It\u2019s genuineness is there , until it\u2019s not . While Lila Velez is very \u201cHerself\u201d, Aleksey F\u00fcrst is very \u201cChristian Gray\u201d. He\u2019s dominant, aloof, secretive, kinky; and, he changes for the first woman who says \u201cNo\u201d: \u201c \u2018I wish you weren\u2019t afraid of me.\u2019 \u2018But I am. That\u2019s the reason I can\u2019t accept your training proposition.\u2019 His grave expression speaks louder than words. Aleksey isn\u2019t used to the word no. \u2018I think it\u2019d feel better with my friend. I know him well, trust him, and it wouldn\u2019t be a one-night stand. Nothing against casual sex, but I have expectations, and I won\u2019t settle for less.\u2019 \u2018Fine,\u2019 he says curtly. \u2018Tell me what your expectations are and I\u2019ll adapt.\u2019 \" ~ Aleksey & Lila The fact that too much time is spent on Lila\u2019s growth and not enough on Aleksey\u2019s render the FSOG similarities extraneous. Not until the very end are his secrets revealed. Thus, Aleksey\u2019s development feels insubstantial, his \u201ckinks\u201d inorganic, and his behavior erratic. The couple\u2019s HEA is also problematic, as Lila\u2019s \"recruitment\u201d gives Aleksey too much control over her future. Considering her independent nature and pro-choice stance, her happiness with the arrangement rings false. Despite the story's imperfections , there are many moments of great linguistic lyricism and beauty: \u201cMost girls prefer flowers over trees. Flowers blossom quickly. They speak of passion. Of beauty. But they wither so easily. A tree doesn\u2019t speak of passion but sturdiness. It grows higher. Lasts longer. Some trees have been here before I was born and they\u2019ll be here when I\u2019m gone. Real love ought to be more like a tree and less like a flower.\u201d ~ Lila Ultimately, it\u2019s Mya Robarts\u2019 eloquence, creativity, and unique philosophy that make The V-Girl as compelling as a sea green abyss. Were I you, I would not be afraid to succumb to it. To Veronica, who recommended this book to me: For information about my rating system, see my profile page.

Behold the handsomeness and fierceness of Aleksey F\u00dcrst. Meet Lila, a heroine you might love or hate depending in how you feel you'd act if facing her problems Is it acceptable that a girl takes matter in her own hands to avoid a life of slavery? Should she try with different guys or should she accept Aleksey\u2019s proposal and his \u201cquirks\u201d? Justify your answer. What would you do if it was you the one in danger of being taken by the soldiers if you don\u2019t lose your virginity first? That\u2019s the basic premise. Lila is 18 and wants to lose her virginity and feel at least for once, that she\u2019s safe in the sexual department. There are a lot of events, some violent, some funny, some sweet that all revolve around Lila\u2019s basic need of connecting to another person through sex. This will save her from recruitment a.k.a rape. I love the romance, the messages, the poems between chapters, the world building. I can explain the Second civil war as well as I can explain the first one. I stayed up late last night to finish this book and I\u2019m captivated. Perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019ve had my own story with the theme of this book, but I love it. I think that only a few of new adult authors can handle the topic well and make it heart-wrenching, romantic, entertaining and thought provoking without making it preachy nor boring. Mya Robarts is one of those authors. She delivers a story that keeps the reader laughing, raging, hating, loving, thinking, cringing applauding, and when it ends you are free to take the messages with you as food for thought, or think about this book as a love story. A brutal love story but romantic nonetheless. The V Girl contains graphic scenes that might shock some readers, but let me assure you that the graphicness is reserved to consensual acts of sex and a horrible depiction of what torture really is. Although rape is a reality in this world we don\u2019t get to witness it. We know it more from backstory and the way the author showed us the feelings of the characters. Lila\u2019s fears became mine as I was reading and that\u2019s to the credit of the world-building and writing. The prose is simple, unadorned, straight to the point, and that makes the situations believable. Even the romance. As far as the dystopian genre goes, this isn\u2019t the typical story where the circumstances are tweaked to make the protagonist the leader. No rebels, no special powers, no arms are handled to the protagonist in a silver plate so she\u2019ll lead the rebel forces against the oppressive government. Lila will find that if she has to lead a rebellion she\u2019ll have to: 1) learn how to drive in a place where this is forbidden for her people 2) stir her gang to become stronger, because they suck. 3) Learn to fight with her own hands because The guns of the resistance gang are primitive. 4) Become a leader herself when she would prefer not. But the current leader of the rebellion sucks at it. This is refreshing. Not every YA dystopia (or more like NA dystopia) character has to be Katniss or Tris. Katniss struggled to become a leader, but still she got people eager to make her a symbol and Tris didn\u2019t seem to have any difficulty getting guns. Lila will have to learn how to use everyday objects as guns and will have to do what she can to become stronger. I admire her so much because of this. If it were me I wouldn\u2019t want to go out of my house ever. I'd live in hiding. Aleksy is fantastic... I could predict from the first chapter that he\u2019d be a love interest, but other than that I couldn\u2019t see where the relationship would go. You'll find what I'd call an I-want-to-use-you triangle here. Lila wants to use her best friend but she doesn\u2019t want a relationship with him, or anyone. Best friend wants to save Lila \u201cfrom sin\u201d but he wants to be in love with his dead ex-fianc\u00e9 forever, and Aleksey wants to deflower Lila, but he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s capable of love and he knows he won\u2019t be around for her. Aleksey doesn\u2019t want to fall in love but he will and that is one of my favorite parts of this book. In terms of steamy scenes, I think that they were well written and sexy. Some are rough, some are sweet, some are graphic but all are realistic and vital to the plot or the overall message of the book. I enjoyed them all! For example this quote Why does it have to hurt only me? It\u2019s true! Why sexuality is always more difficult for women than for men. Not fair. But as I said the messages are there hidden between the characters actions if you want to see them, but if you don\u2019t this is still a very compelling story of fighting for love and against love. I want to recommend this book to 18 plus readers, because some topics here are disturbing, but any reader that can handle the heavy subject will enjoy the book. Read this if you want something different. ...more Thank you, Mya for the e-book copy in exchange for an honest review! I fucking loved it!! The V Girl by Mya Robarts.

Thank you, Mya for the e-book copy in exchange for an honest review! I fucking loved it!! The V Girl by Mya Robarts. Has a gif ever been more accurate? 'The V Girl' by Mya Robarts is Brutal yet Brilliant. Set in post apocalyptic America, The V Girl illustrates a society where rape is not only legal, but excepted. In her awesome debut, Mya Robarts crafts a unique story with unforgettable characters and tackles heavy topics effortlessly and with maturity. At times, 'The V Girl' is difficult to read. Not because there are graphic scenes (which there are...so, beware) but because of the world these characters that you come to know and love live in such a brutal society where consent is something of the past. And always in the back of my head as I was reading this is that this , this life is the norm for these people. There is something disillusioning about that and frankly terrifying. We follow Lila, our heroine, who is a: as she is racing against the proverbial clock to lose her virginity before the Recruitment Ceremony-a legal ceremony where soldiers can come and terrorize towns-where she will be forced to give it up without her consent in what will be a violent filled and humiliating experience. Lila is a extremely unique character. A Gem in fact. She is complex and made mature for her age by circumstance. She literally has no choice but to grow up and be an adult. (We see this especially in her younger sister, Azzy, who is a child but mental is most definitely not a child) Lila is not the innocent heroine I was expecting, at all. She goes far and beyond all my expectations. One of my favorite aspects of Lila is that (view spoiler) [she is a Voyeur. Though she is not sexually active prior to her attempts throughout the book, She watches other people having sex (with their consent, she isn't a creep.) (hide spoiler) ] Lila sees and goes through a lot of things that I don't think I could have handled. She's a strong heroine who literally fights her way through life. Throughout the book, Lila attempts to lose her virginity leading to awkward and sometimes funny situations where you honestly feel for the girl cause C'mon!I can totally understand her desperation and I found myself stressing for her for most of the book because the soldiers believe that if they 'bed' a virgin all their sexually transmitted diseases etc with be vanquished. Thus on the night of recruitment, if you are a virgin you will be on high demand.(as if it wasn't horrifying enough) Then Lila's world is turned up side down when she meets, Alexsey (YAS!), an ex-solider who turns her for a loop, defying everything she thought soldiers were. He tempts her like no one has before making her want someone she really shouldn't want. Alexsey is perfect. Long blonde hair, intense blue eyes, he is sexy, adorable and brooding. What else could a girl ask for? Honestly, Alexsey is also thrown for a loop when he meets Lila and finds himself, unexpectedly/unbelievable in love. Once again, Mya wrote a really unique character that exudes magnetism. 'The V Girl' has so many twists and turns and they had me going crazy and threatening Armageddon. I was basically a mess a certain parts. It was a whip lash of emotions, I shit thee not: Then finally: Lila's 'emergency deflowering' is not the only aspect of this book. 'The V Girl' has many different aspects to it: War, fighting for your freedom, love, the society of the world. It's utterly addictive and I want more. 'The V Girl' is about changing your own destiny, fighting for your rights, falling in love in such desperate times and what it means to be human. It's dark, unique and addictive. I demand more, Mya!

I decided to give this story another chance because it had a lot of potential to be great... and it is! Whereas before, I was so distracted by all the grammatical errors that I just couldn't fully get into the story, now I was completely immersed in Lila's world. Even though I read this book a while back, and ultimately knew what happened, I found myself staying up late in the night to finish it. I finished this book within 24 hours! While I still wholeheartedly agree with my review below, I'm still in love with Aleksey's character and still found Lila to be way too immature for her age and the environment she grew up in, I found that my response to the newly revised edition was greater than when I initially read it. And again, I already knew what was going to happen! Which is why I'm going to be changing my 3 star rating to a 5 star rating. Not only was I unable to put down the book, but I wanted to backtrack just to keep the story alive a little longer. Original review... Lila lives in a cruel world. A world where recruitment isn't just for military but rather for the military's sexual services. The soldiers go from town to town and recruit young men and women to be their own personal sex slaves. That's not the worst part, during the recruitment process, the soldiers can choose anyone to rape on a ceremonial stone. The soldiers will be coming to Lila's town next and she's of age to be recruited. She refuses to have her first time be against her will. So, she tries to get her best-friend to sleep with her. However, she wasn't expecting the protection and love of a certain neutral cop. This story reminded me a lot of The Bronze Horseman . You have Lila who is in a place of need. Her father and brother have medical conditions that make her family the town pariahs. Lila is a very inexperienced girl when it comes to love, relationships, and sex. So, when Aleksey shows up and takes a sudden interest in her by offering her family protection, giving them his food rations, and ultimately taking care of them as best as he can without raising suspicion among the other cops. So many things reminded me of The Bronze Horseman but at the same time, the author added so many new elements to it that I didn't feel like I was reading the same story. My one major complaint about the book was the fact that it felt like the book had never graced the desk of an editor. There were words missing, sentences that were jumbled up, and sometimes it took me a few tries to figure out what the author meant. I generally tend to overlook them as long as they don't interfere with the flow of the story but there were so many of them that it became a big problem for me. I think once this goes through the editorial wringer it will be great. Aside from that though I though the story was great. I fell for Aleksey immediately. I mean, here he is, new to the area and all of a sudden he's saving Lila's family left and right. Once during an air raid when the person at the bunker entrance wouldn't let them enter because of her father and brother's disabilities. Aleksey could have just turned a blind eye and let them continue on their way to a new hiding spot but instead he marches up to that bunker and rains hell and fire down on the guy who didn't let them in. He doesn't stop there though, when their home is destroyed in the air raid, no one is willing to take them in even though they've been ordered to take in those who need a place to stay. Again, he could have just let the towns people figure it out on their own, but not Aleksey. Nope. He shames them all for their behavior and then takes Lila's family to the building where he tends to injured soldiers since his position is sort of like a doctor. There were just so many sweet things he did for Lila that really melted my heart. \"I've put my life at risk for others ever since I joined the Army. It'd be a nice change to risk my life for something I want for me . I crave you.\" While I loved Aleksey, I couldn't stand Lila. She was supposed to be eighteen years old but the way she behaved made me think she was closer to fourteen. I mean, she keep trying to sleep with her friend who doesn't want to sleep with her. Meanwhile, there's Aleksey who's taken care of her from the day he arrived and has offered his services to her but she refuses him. Not only that but knowing about the dangers leading up to the recruitment, she does stupid things like leave her house at night to try to seduce her friend. Mind you, there are patrols going on with soldiers and cops around who wouldn't hesitate to take privileges with a teenage girl who's out at night. Heck, one guy had already assaulted her already in broad daylight with people around. Those people just turned a blind eye. So tell me why, why would you go out at night knowing the dangers?! She really frustrated me. The V Girl was nothing like I expected. It was dark, gritty, but at the same time very romantic. I know those things shouldn't go together but they did. I think the sweet romance between Aleksey and Lila helped balance out all of the darkness. I enjoyed reading this story and look forward to what the author has in store for readers next.

A wild ride, yes, but an incredible story. I wish there was more. More to read. Not because I was left unsatisfied, on the contrary, but because I fell in love with both Aleksey and Lila. So much so, that I wish there was a second book, so I could get more of them. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not the case. I need to point out that if you\u2019re highly uncomfortable with subjects like rape, violence, and injustice, you probably shouldn't read this book. It's really not for you. There aren\u2019t any explicit rape scenes, but I would still describe it as a major part of the story. It\u2019s definitely a book intended for adults. This novel is what we call a \u201ccoming of age\u201d story. It means one or both protagonists go through some major character development, and most of the time grow up through the course of the story. And that\u2019s exactly what Lila went through. She started out as this frightened and na\u00efve girl and grew to become an incredibly strong-willed, independent and courageous woman. She truly amazed me. Her determination and perseverance when it came to respecting herself, her body and her values were truly astonishing. It can be rare -- sometimes -- in romance novels to find a female protagonist that isn\u2019t going through extensive changes in order to accommodate the man in the story. Lila wasn\u2019t that girl. She was going through some changes, but that wasn\u2019t because of a man, it was because she didn\u2019t want to be the fearful girl she used to be anymore. She did it for herself. It was an empowering experience for Lila, but also for us, as readers. As a woman, Lila was extremely relatable, and she made me feel more confident about myself. Characters like that are precious. As for Aleksey? It\u2019s rare that I don\u2019t really talk about the male protagonist in a story, but I won\u2019t talk about him very much in this review. I'll say this, though: Aleksey was a beautiful character. Yes physically, but I meant more psychologically. He had secrets of his own, he was a very solitary man and he was far from being perfect. However, for some reason, he did feel perfect to me. He was supportive, understanding, and always ready to help Lila in any way she needed. But he also knew when to leave her to deal with her own battles alone. That's a rare thing in romance, unfortunately. Also, he was a very sexy character but in a slightly weird way. He wasn\u2019t really a dirty talker -- he wasn\u2019t much of a talker at all, actually -- but oddly enough, when he did speak, it always felt very seductive and personal. I don\u2019t know how to explain it, his imperfections made him perfect and I couldn\u2019t help but fall for him. Real hard. The story in itself was remarkable. It was like nothing I\u2019ve read before. There were so many details, so many different aspects and together they created a world that felt real. Plausible. It felt like a spectacular combination of our world's past and its future. A true work of art that has been well researched and well thought of. Mya Robarts kept surprising me, whether it was with new concepts, new ideas or new theories, I felt overwhelmed with the genius of this story. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, there\u2019s nothing likable in the world Lila and Aleksey are living in, but that doesn\u2019t mean as a reader you can\u2019t enjoy the beauty of one's imagination. It IS a post-apocalyptic world, so of course, it\u2019s going to be just that; apocalyptic, but it's also marvelously fascinating. The plot, the story line and the writing, all of them had me completely entranced. I gave this book 4.5/5 stars instead of 5/5 stars and that is because of how the story started. It was very rocky at first. What I mean is; it was very complex, very difficult to understand, a lot of information was thrown at you left, right and center and it was quite hard to get used to. It took some adaptation on my part. That\u2019s for sure. I have to point out that I almost gave up after chapter four. I didn\u2019t understand why tons and tons of information about this weird post-apocalyptic world were thrown at me. Plus, Mya Robarts writing style felt very unconventional at first. Different. However, I kept my hopes up and continued reading the book. And I couldn\u2019t be any happier that I did. I now understand why so many details and world building was being hurled at me in the first few chapters, and that's because the author wanted to make sure we knew exactly what this world was all about before she actually started the story. Truth be told, right after these first four chapters, when the story actually picked up, I was immediately sucked in. The pages were turning on their own, and time was flying by, but the only thing I seemed to care about was what was going to happen next in the story. If life hadn\u2019t got in my way, I would have read this book in a matter of hours. If you\u2019re looking for something different, something that might get you out of your comfort zone, something that will make you think about issues like rape and violence, this book is perfect for you. It was an intense, fast-paced, unique ride. One I\u2019m not going to forget anytime soon. I\u2019ll also add that this book comes with a playlist. So, for the music lovers out there like myself, this book is just that much more complete and exciting. ...more The V Girl by Mya Robarts was a book that took me completely by surprise. I\u2019d read reviews of the book before. I knew what it was going to be about. But I wasn\u2019t quite prepared for the avalanche of emotions and strong opinions that were going to hit me. And by strong opinions, I don\u2019t mean the right or wrong opinion of the author. But the author explores the ideas of sex and rape in positive and negative ways alike.

And by strong opinions, I don\u2019t mean the right or wrong opinion of the author. But the author explores the ideas of sex and rape in positive and negative ways alike. You can tell that this book is set in the future, but it shares some relations to the world we know as well. This combination makes it possible for us to really understand the situation, but the author also includes some ideas that are entirely foreign to us as well. All of it is well described so that it was easy to understand without it becoming info-dumpy in the process. I really liked the main character, Lila. I might not have agreed with everything she was doing, but I could see things from her point of view and understood her reasoning. Which was all that mattered, really. Lila is a character who is strong, independent and sassy sometimes. She wants to find love, but at the same time she wants to be safe and doesn\u2019t want to compromise one for the other. Besides her goals in life, it\u2019s also evident that she truly values her family. She is always watching out for her cynical younger sister, Azzy, and her younger brother Olmo who has fibrosis. On top of all that, her father is disabled as his legs have been crushed through abuse. She really takes on the role as the head of the family. The book is incredibly graphic when it comes to descriptions of torture, rape and also any violence people have to experience in this book. The author writes in the synopsis that this is one for eighteen year old readers and above, and I have to agree. It clearly shows the true horrors behind the violation of rape and the abuse that some people experience just for being born the way they were. Other themes such as racism, friendship and also religious viewpoints are discussed in this book. Despite this one being so heavily focused on the idea of civil war and rape, there is also making love in a positive matter mentioned too. That\u2019s the kind of thing Lila is looking for in this novel, with the right person. She has two main options open for her \u2013 so yes, there is a little bit of a love triangle in this one. Both men are stark opposites of the spectrum and because it isn\u2019t Lila trying to lead them on \u2013 she clearly states what she wants from both and gives them the chance to give it to her \u2013 I didn\u2019t mind it too much. A little bit at the end I did, but otherwise I was fine with the love triangle. And let me just say \u2013 when making love was mentioned or described in a positive manner, the tension between the couple was palpable. It was incredibly steamy >.> That\u2019s all I am going to say about that :D There was a little bit of banter between Alesky and her (one of the love interests) and this novel \u2013 despite covering all those themes \u2013 is really about coming of age. Virginity can be related to that, but this novel also really relates it to her personal growth as a person, as she realises when she cares about and what she is willing to risk her life for. The novel is also centered on the human touch. In a world where rape is legal and everyone is poverty stricken, is there such a thing as human love and kindness anymore? The author cleverly poses this question and we see the theme develop and unfold throughout the novel. I really enjoyed reading this. It was a bit much to center an entire novel on, but I raced through it in the matter of a few days. I appreciated the way the author slowly revealed the main themes of this novel and more and more about the situations in the story as well. Well written!

This book is the most devastating, sexually frustrating, most arousing, absolutely horrifically beautiful book I've read in forever- or maybe just ever. I did not think I would like this book. I have my own tragedy from childhood so the mention of abuse and rape tend to steer me running in the opposite direction.

This book is the most devastating, sexually frustrating, most arousing, absolutely horrifically beautiful book I've read in forever- or maybe just ever. I did not think I would like this book. I have my own tragedy from childhood so the mention of abuse and rape tend to steer me running in the opposite direction. Boy would I have regretted every word I didn't read of this book of I had passed on it. Now it's not light, short, or hollow. It's complex, terrible, haunting, tragic, and yet beautiful, loving, and magical all in one. This is a dystopian- but not a fantasy. That was my other doubt, as I strictly review paranormal/fantasy books. Let me make this clear before I go any further-- DO NOT PASS ON THIS BOOK!!!!! One more time- do not mistake a vague small blurb that you think you understand have you thinking that this book is not something completely magnificent. I did not think one should care so much about being a virgin, and thought I knew what was going to happen- no I was wrong. And I am both completely heartbroken and brilliantly captivated by the beauty of this book. Now- I will talk as much as I can about this book without spoilers because I think everyone should go into this book like I did- I never read a review for it on purpose- though I usually read a few before hand. I read the synopsis and went straight in and I was not only surprised, I was completely committed to every single word. I had a very surprising amount of conflicting emotions throughout this whole book. I laughed, I cried, I loved, I hated, I raged, and I completely broke down because it's inevitable if you even read a few pages. I am not sure I can express things without saying something that will ruin something else but I'm gunna try really hard. With the US bit longer that- it's split in two- with each side warring each other- some of the rules have changed. Rape is legal and condoned and completely almost celebrated with ceremonies- dear God I said some prayers while reading this book. Because of this- recruitment is a ceremony where the soldiers will take what they want, how they want, with whom they want. And no one- nothing- can stop them nor can they run from it. Lila is set to have her recruitment ceremony soon- she's that age- and if she's a Virgin, she'll be forced to do things I never thought I could imagine. They call her V-girl like a derogatory name and she's desperate to make sure this first time, she has choices. So she is set to make her best friend sleep with her. But things don't always work out like we want- or even hope. Here and now- we want every girl to KEEP her v card for as long as possible. Lila lives in a world that if you possess that v card, it's a death sentence or pretty damn close to it. I will not explain this any more because you need to understand it from Lila. I think reading how she felt and what she thinks makes the world of a difference to get the full effect. But I will talk about Lila. She's 18, she's pretty but everyone thinks she's strange so they avoid her and her family. Her dad is a doctor but it's a complicated thing in this time. Her was gravely injured in trying to protect Lila's mother, and that's a whole different category I can't explain. She has twin siblings whom I completely adored and fell in love with. Her best friend Rey is almost her saving grace, but he's her best friend, and they struggle through a whole heap of things throughout the whole story. I liked Rey, I wanted to cheer for him, but come on- Aleksy just stole the damn show from the moment Lila laid terrified eyes on him. He's a beautiful disaster and one that was so welcome. And sometimes- Lila needed a swift kick in the ass because when it came to those two in her life- she was so damn see-sawed with her feelings! Lawd I almost slapped her lol. But it's hard to judge someone when what they have over their hang is a life or death decision and can directly effect every single person connected to you. When something so profoundly devastating happens to you- there's a lot of confusing things that will happen to you and your judgement too. And Lila won't be the only one who will have to deal with devastation in here. Now with the amount of frustrations here, there's only one real romantic sex scene. Notice I said romantic. Do not mistake this for a swoon worthy sweet romance. It's a romance but I will repeat tragic and disastrous and hauntingly beautifully brilliant. I have never been so heartbroken for so many different people. And if I can say one thing- do not so drugs- yes this means a whole lot if you read the book. But back on topic- when that romantic sex scene finally happened-I swear I was at a football game- hooting and hollering and crying like I won the game... I'm from the south ok- football is almost a religion lol along with food lol!! But let me say that I pretty much feared every other sex scene for good reason. This author does not leave one soul untouched! I am completely dumbfounded at how this author weaved her words to take something horrible and turn it to what it became. And through it all- there was hope that hung on by a thread. And love that blossomed in the most hateful place of all. I freaking loved that part!!!!!! And most of all... Lila keeps her VGirl name- but virgin is not what it means, and I couldn't agree with her more! One small thing... I have to say this, I just can't not... There's some memorable moments that though I will completely befuddle your brain with, I must talk about them. They almost times... There are several and I swear I almost hyperventilated. The almost love of a best friend- though it turns to love but changes. The almost downfall of her sister and the true downfall of her other great friend. The love shared by that other couple- yeah I cheered for them. The right hand man and best friend if Aleksy and his complete tragic sacrifice for Lila- Tristan- if I could I would scoop you up, though there's multiple reasons you can't. The first kiss... Yeah I can't not mention that because it about blew my mind!! Ok enough- I think This may be the longest review I've ever written but I could go on- seriously-I have several more things I'd love to talk about. If you haven't noticed- the author has left an extreme imprint on me. That should say a lot to you about her skills of writing. I'm awed and amazed if you need a description. I don't know what else to say except read this. If only to show you that sometimes all you have is hope and you should hang on to it with every single piece of you that you have. And never let it go. Ever. And I will leave you with my 5 PAWs because this book should win awards- a lot of them. ...more You can see this and other reviews on my blog: Book Nerd Paradise At first, I was very cautious to try out The V Girl.

The blurb isn't very clear as to how explicit the book is, or if it's more along the lines of bdsm/erotica. In the end, I took a chance, figuring that I could just set it aside if it made me too uncomfortable. After I closed the final chapter, I took a few moments to gather my thoughts and feelings. This book is very different that what I normally read and the conclusion I came to boils down to one word: thought-provoking. Not only does The V Girl have the typical elements of a traditional novel - there's a story line, character building, world building, romance - but it also takes a look serious subjects and makes the reader think about them. What happens to society when rape is legal and everyone has been affected by it in one way or another? There's a scene in the book where our MC, Lila, talks about how it's best to dress so as not to attract the attention of men. This really got me thinking about how relevant this is to society today. Girl are sent home from school because their outfits are a distraction to their male counterparts. Instead of teaching boys to respect a woman's body and that no really does mean no, we're putting the blame solely on girls dressing too provocatively. It's the old ignorant argument of \"she deserves it if she dresses like that.\" It also takes a look at the line between consensual and non-consensual. Is it really consensual if your only other option is to be raped in front of an audience? What do you do when the world is so messed up, it's almost beyond repair? These are the kinds of deep thoughts I had while reading The V Girl. But on top of all that, The V Girl is the story of one girl's survival and journey to love in this dark and sinister world. It's exceptionally written; all of Lila's thoughts and fears became mine as I was reading. I was rooting for her and Aleksey the whole time as they fought to find a solution. Lastly, for those who might be uncomfortable with this topic, while there are instances of rape in this book, they are not explicitly graphic. ** I was provided a copy of this book through NetGalley in return for an honest review ...more Updated: Finally I updated my kindle and got to read the ending of this awesome book.

I can't wait to read more of this author. The action takes place in the year 21st after the civil war. Lila Velez lives in Starville, a futuristic city that is about to lose the war against the Patriot states of America. The Patriot Government spoils its Army to the point that they let them \"recruit\" girls and boys in any way they want a.k.a. as their b.i.t.c.h@.s. For that they invented the recruitment ceremony and Lila is eligible for the first time. The book starts when Lila goes to a river to take a bath and shave her legs to have a big night with her friend Rey Diaz. In the river (view spoiler) [she has a terrifying encounter with a soldier. (hide spoiler) ] The soldiers are genetically engineered men who take drugs to become super strong and invincible. And she finds herself alone and naked with one of them. Very early in the book we get to meet Aleksey F\u00fcrst (YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY, AND SUPERYUMMY) He is a General and a doctor from an army called the Acord Unit cops. In theory they\u2019re there to prevent that Patriots recruit underage kids or married woman or abuse the population. They're supposed to do so, but it's not even the first half of the book when someone gets VICIOUSLY attacked (\u201coff camera\u201d, I guess the author didn't want to push censorship) and the Accord cops can do nothing because it's legal. Aleksey remains mysterious for a good part of the book and although he seems to be sexually attracted to Lila I found myself distrusting and loving the guy as much as Lila did. He\u2019s older, sexual experienced and too big for a virgin girl. Literally. (view spoiler) [So like Lila I preferred the guy with a little less experience. (hide spoiler) ] The problem is that Lila is a very complicated girl. Seriously I was all the time like: \"C\u2019mon on girl, force that prude to have sex with you.\" And then I realized what I was doing. I was somehow rooting for her to \u201crape\u201d Rey! We are always so eager to discuss when men abuse women and not so eager to discuss when we as women put too much pressure into guys to have sex. Lila always questions whether she's pushing Rey too much. Because if you think this book is about female rape, then you're wrong. In this book it doesn't matter if you're a girl or a boy. The soldiers find people in a lonely place and bam! Abuse is a sure thing. Even if the book loses steam a couple of times there are a couple of twists that I didn\u2019t see coming that kept me Reading, mostly because as bleak as the topic is the Velez family has a tendency to discuss sexual topics aloud. I found Azzy, Lila\u2019s eleven year old sister, very creepy, but in a funny way, because she\u2019s very precocious. The best part of the book was Lila. She wasn\u2019t whiny, she was innocent but never acted like a stupid virgin who doesn\u2019t even know how to read an e-mail and she didn\u2019t make me mad a single time (update: she pissed me off almost at the end, but later she redeemed herself). She is as Aleksey describes her a fighter. She\u2019s part of The Comanche resistance and she's a good fighter who tries to get better every day. Another thing I like about this book is that there\u2019s a sense of a religion. When I read dystopias I always wonder how religion works in the future, but authors never mention this. There\u2019s this little detail that I love. Patriots don\u2019t allow Nats to have books EXCEPT religious book. They are very oppressive ,but THEY ALLOW A RELIGIOUS FESTIVITY. The few soldiers that aren\u2019t rapists HAVE RELIGIOUS MOTIVATIONS. And they give a religious tone to their executions. It sounds to me like the Patriots leaders will take control of the Nats and their troops through superstition and religion. Very interesting and very thought provoking There\u2019s a lot of building up of the relationship between Lila, Aleksey and Rey before anything sexual occurs, this is not the kind of book where you can dive directly into the sex scenes. If that\u2019s what you like you\u2019ll find the book slow. I myself was intrigued with the world. How come the USA became a place like that? Starvillers have a ban on technology and live in the worst conditions while the patriots live in beautiful cities. I couldn\u2019t turn the pages fast enough. That doesn\u2019t mean that the book doesn\u2019t have a couple of steamy scenes early in the book, but they\u2019re not graphic. (update, sex scenes are extremely graphic, so beware) But a very descriptive scene takes place around the 60% mark. Overall a 4.5. I want more of Aleksey, Lila and Azzy. Update 2: Ms. Roberts I don't want to read about Rey or any other of that family, what a group of backstabbing jerks. I liked Rey at first, but now I hate him.Just write more about Aleksey please. Update 4: The book at the end leaned more towards the romance, so if romance is not your thing, avoid the book. ...more Will give full review soon\u2026 I need to let this one sit with me for a bit before I divulge.

So apparently, I was thinking so much about this book long after finishing it, that I forgot to give my review! So, without further ado. This book was amazing. I stumbled upon this while looking for something different and new to read. I had been in a bit of a reading rut and needed something that would really catch my attention. After reading the synopsis and many rave reviews about \"V Girl\" I had to read it. I was disappointed to learn a print copy was not available since that is really only what I read. I tend to have a terrible time reading anything on an e-reader due to migraine headaches. Woe be me. I usually just skip anything that is exclusively e-reader for that very reason. Glad I didn't with this one. I broke down and bought the e-reader version of this and if work and life wasn't an irruption\u2026 I would have read it in a day. In-between the times the book had to be put aside for work and such, I couldn't stop thinking about it. You know a book is good when you can not wait to get home and finish it. Before I continue on with what I loved about the book, I do want to share this bit of information. Since I loved the book so much, I wanted to know if a hardcopy was going to eventually be available because 1.) I want to re-read it again sometime soon and 2.) it definitely deserves a spot on the bookshelf. A book this good can not sit it digital format alone. Anyways. I contacted the author and this is the reply I was given by her: http://myarobarts.tumblr.com/post/129... Back to the review. You know when you pick up a romance, dystopia novel and you like the idea of the story, the characters, the setting, etc\u2026 but the writing stinks? Well, fear not my fellow booklovers\u2026 this is not one of those books that leaves you wanting more for all the wrong reasons. Mya is actually a really good writer and let me tell you\u2026 there are some great quotes from this book. There was multiple times I stopped and really reflected on what she wrote and went back and re-read it. It's that good. Yes, this book is heavy on the sex scenes, but as mentioned above\u2026 it's not just the sexy scenes that make you pause to really soak them in. The scenes in-between the love scenes are just so well written. You are not just getting smut here. Which I love! I love my awesomely written sex scenes, but I also love a good plot and character development. Which is exactly what you get. Lila, the main character just wants to hold on to one of the few things that she can actually call her own in a world where women are regarded as objects that are meant to satisfy men. All Lila wants is to lose her virginity to someone she can at least call a friend that she trusts. She will sacrifice love as along as she can be the one that decides whom she loses her virginity too before she comes of age when the soldiers patrolling the city she lives in takes it from her in whatever regard they want to. Her closest male friend just isn't willing to help out right away which complicates matters for Lila. After running in to solider Aleksey Furst in what can be described as anything more then awkward things start to get complicated when she starts having feelings for him and visa versa. I will only give that much to you in this review because this is one of those books that you really need to experience for yourself firsthand to really love it as much as myself and all the other readers. All I can say is if you want a good romance with some great sex scenes that are not cheesy and actually give you a good rush, then this book is definitely for you. I would like all those reading this review to understand that I do not typically seek out story plots that come with strong ratings that mention that rape and sexual abuse are strong themes. I thought when first stumbling upon this book that such themes were leaning more towards being a fetish, but I can assure you that is not the case. This book is still not for a reader under 17 though. I do warn that triggers can be caused by this book so precede with caution if that is something that bothers you. ...more You can find this review on my blog: https://makingdaysbetter.wordpress.co...

Rey was selfish a lot of times and Aleksey was really scary, I fear him I think the entire book, I wouldn't be with him :/ But I have to say no matter what, Aleksey was my favorite :P I enjoy this book a lot! :D It made me felt pity and sadness a lot of times because of the bad things that were happening but also curiosity and happiness from time to time, especially when her sister and brother fought or her sister being mature (So cute, I loove her) <3 The best part was when Lila discovered a secret from Aleksey! I was in shock! I couldn't make a reasonable thought. I was so scary and I couldn't believe it. I remember it now and I start babbling. You should totally read this book because of that secret. Mya wrote about something I'd never heard before and is really cool. But the bad thing is that they didn't talk about that anymore, and I was curious :P The strange thing was that a lot of times I felt like there were all against Lila or it was just one of her dreams. I thought \"She has something going on\" or \"I bet that is a trap\". But it weren't so I guess I was paranoid at that moment :P I don't know if that feeling is something good or bad :/ I'll guess is good because it made me want to keep reading :) The issues I had with this book were that there's the \"Alpha\" man I don't like and the end wasn't realistic for me, I would prefer a more dramatic one :/ . Also I was expecting a little more deep book, showing a sad and autodestructive society but I didn't get that sensation. However, there's a scene that Mya narrated really explicit how the soldiers killed people :/ And it was horrible, which is a good thing because it felt more real... However, The V Girl book was really entertaining, fast reading and it sucks you in (At least that did to me :P ).

It was almost one of those speechless moments where you are pleasantly surprised by how good a book was. I normally read dystopia books or romance books that are light reads and can easily be read quickly so I can then move onto the next book. However, I was unable to do so with this book. This author has serious talent in making a world so realistic that I feared for Lila as if I was one of her close friends in the book. The author explores the topic of rape in a world where people accept it as part of their daily lives. However, Lila refuses to allow herself to be raped by the soldiers when/if they come while she is still a \"V Girl.\" This sets the scene for a book where a young girl tries to figure out what qualifies for love and how to protect both herself and her family in such a cruel world. Now, normally I do not like books that deal with rape, especially books that have this topic as one of the focal points. However, this book was different. The author was almost poetic in her descriptions and I never had a point where I thought she went too far. There were not as many sexual scenes as I thought there would be since the majority of the time is spent following Lila on her journey of discovery in this environment. I was highly impressed by the author's ability to discuss such an adult topic yet calm it down enough so that it was appropriate for 17 or 18+. There were so many ways this book could go wrong and yet everything flowed without error. In addition the Lila the author developed Lila's friends Rey and Aleksey. Well, Alekesy is not really a friend but I am just going to describe him as such since he is such a complex character. The author made sure that the reader connected with not only the heroine but all of the characters. I did not want this book to end since I wanted to see Lila succeed in such a cruel world. Another thing I appreciated about this book is that the main character mainly thinks only to protect herself and her family. It made the book seem more realistic as she was not trying to be a hero yet her characteristics made her a hero anyway. I would 100% recommend this book to anyone who thinks they will enjoy this book. I will admit that this book may not be for the faint of heart but it was SO good. I will definitely be looking out for other books by this author. ...more Wow, The V-Girl is one hell of a book. What a punch it throws to the heart and soul!

I might go back someday to better elaborate and all the specifics that made me go \u201cYes! Yes! Fuck yes!\u201d This is a powerful story that tells the story of an 18 year old girl working hard to keep living from day to day who is exploring her sexuality and herself in a world where there\u2019s war and the recruitment (which is a showy ceremony of legalized rape) looming above her. She suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder after witnessing many horrible things\u2014and has likely developed her voyeurism kink from the trauma\u2014yet still yearns to be loved and have a consensual, trusting sexual relationship, especially since recruitment is fast approaching and Lila cannot bear the idea of being raped by soldiers like her mother was and experiencing sex for the first time under such horrible circumstances. She wants to lose her virginity to protect herself and to have a bit of control over her body in a world that doesn\u2019t think anyone has that right\u2014the right of autonomy. It\u2019s very easy to relate to Lila; her fears, her wants, her hopes, her turmoil. She\u2019s everything an 18 year girl is\u2014full of complex feelings and desires, a blend of childishness and maturity that is on the cusp of true confidence and ownership of self\u2014but she is also so much more: a survivor, a fighter, a dreamer, someone who expects the worst but deep down wishes and hopes for the best. I loved Lila. Not once did I feel unsatisfied with her character; I could understand her very well and thought she was a great choice of a heroine. This is where Aleksey comes in; he\u2019s actually super well written too. He embodies the \u201calpha male\u201d archetype, but in a way that removes him entirely from being abusive. He heavily values consent, is open and forthcoming about his wants with Lila and the constructs of their relationship as it progresses from sexual connection to deep romantic love (so, for example, he doesn\u2019t lie to her about wanting a romantic relationship with her at first and is honest about wanting to be just about a sexual connection and human touch), doesn\u2019t blame Lila for her PTSD or try to force or coerce her into doing something she doesn\u2019t want to, is willing to fulfill the things Lila needs in order to have with him (like consent, trust, and understanding), and always has a firm control over himself with Lila so he doesn\u2019t hurt her\u2014even accidentally. He\u2019s not perfect, of course, he\u2019s suffering from a kind of emotional ignorance and detachment from his hard life, but he slowly learns with Lila and becomes better and better with how to love her and express it, just like how Lila slowly becomes better at trusting and being comfortable with sexual intimacy after her ordeals and fears. Although, one thing I want to address is that Aleksey\u2019s kink is rape roleplay or as the book calls it \u201cconsensual non-consent\u201d; which while, like Lila, that makes me personally a little uncomfortable just because the nature of this is a little complex to define in terms of morality and when it goes to far or is no longer safe/healthy, I think the author handles this in a good way by having Aleksey understand the boundaries of it and that he has to be aware of his partner\u2019s feelings and be sensitive to when consent is withdrawn or a line is drawn. If this was just your average story, I\u2019d say it was unnecessary to add in, but usually the people who have this kink and who are very clear about the boundaries of it either exist in a society that warps sex or they have had a traumatic experience with sexual assault; for example, survivors of rape often engage in rape roleplaying because it\u2019s a way for them to regain a sense of control over their bodies and cope with their trauma (though it can manifest in other people for other reasons). While we\u2019re not given a backstory of how Aleksey got this kink, I\u2019d say it\u2019s safe to assume it manifested from the world he\u2019s in and the things he\u2019s seen, much like how Lila\u2019s voyeurism developed as a result of seeing others get raped and is her coping mechanism. Also, there\u2019s a seven year age gap between our leads, but since we\u2019re in a situation where Lila wasn\u2019t really allowed to be like your average teenager and mature at her own pace, she is presented as a much more mature and competent person than what we see in your average contemporary novel, I\u2019m not being as harsh as I\u2019d usually be. Yes, she\u2019s 18, but generally a 25 year old is a lot more mature and experienced so this creates a power imbalance which is a problem. In this case, even though Aleksey is more experienced and mature, he doesn\u2019t present anything in his behavior that speaks that he would abuse this gap in power and Lila is intelligent and experienced enough to not easily fall prey to being in that situation or be the kind of person someone would target if they had such power-abusing tendencies in mind. We get to watch their relationship develop slowly, understand their individual feelings, their turmoil, and we see how them opening up to each other deepens and intensifies their connection with one another as it grows from one thing into another, so you get a feel that this relationship is real and legitimate, making it quite a realist romance that speaks to readers on deep levels, all while the story somehow makes time to be a platform for discussion and thought regarding the morals of relationships and sex and autonomy at the same time as this epic story of dealing with emotions and sexual desire between two people not quite sure how to merge the two work to find the answers together one clumsy step at a time. As for the writing, the author does a superb job. The style was simple, yet heartfelt and appropriate to the setting. The messages are coherently conveyed, the story soundly weaved, the characters very well fleshed out, and outside of a few errors in my Kindle edition I could find no grievous flaw to the prose. Thumbs up from me! All in all, if you aren\u2019t very sensitive to the topics surrounding rape and aren\u2019t triggered by the topic easily, this is a great read that\u2019s as equally moving for the heart as it thought provoking for the intellect. Though since the book contains a lot of mature subject matter and a few detailed sex scenes, I would definitely say this is new adult, though I think perhaps it\u2019d be worthwhile to have a mature 16 or 17 year old read it because it has such a healthy romance/relationship and offers very sound, good messages regarding some very sensitive issues that are paramount to your average young person and young women especially. (I wrote this kind of fast right before heading out somewhere so I\u2019ll likely return to it at a later date to proofread and maybe add some more stuff! All in all, five star book!

On those occasions, I enjoy the show and feel no guilt about it. The glade where Divine and Joey always make a show out of their love is an almost perfect circle of old trees surrounding grass and orange flowers.

Also, she is incredibly stupid. The razors serve the double purpose of defense and shaving instruments. I hesitate over whether or not to shave my pubic area. What would Rey prefer?

I haven\u2019t lost hope of losing my V, so I exercise my inner muscles through Kegel exercises. I\u2019ll clasp my partner\u2019s penis so tightly that he won\u2019t ever forget me. I just hope I won\u2019t get raped before getting a partner. You see, in this world soldiers rape virgins, because there is a minimum risk of taking illness from an inexperienced partner. But heck, is it written on every girls' forehead that she is a virgin? And what about contraception? Did they forget how to make ol' good condoms? I just don't believe in this V-crap.

First, she had sex with bulky Alexey. No. It turned out she didn't and still has her V. Then she had sex with Rey. Nope. It was also her fantasy. Crap girl, I am tired of this shit. Love interests - hello fucking love triangle - are just as sane as Lila, which means they are not sane at all. I read 5% of the book and was so tired, I don't know why I waited to DNF it till 13%?

The writing was terrible , the thoughts and actions are skittered; there's no order, no logic, just sick sexual fantasies. Why write a book about apocalypse when you could've just written an erotic novel instead? I expected to read about the world of death, slavery, starvation, sexual abuse and the danger of losing the people a person loves the most. I wanted dark, sad, desperate reading with mature, reasonable characters. The annotation promised me all of it. Now I am just frustrated and angry and want to tear this book apart (um, well, I might've done this already) and throw it away to never remember about it again.

Ellos pasan de mirarse de reojo, a saludarse casi a la fuerza, a tener conversaciones de dos frases, a espiar a parejas juntos *raro*, a tener charlas extra\u00f1as, a tratar temas m\u00e1s \u00edntimos, a convertirse en amigos, pero Aleksey conoce la situaci\u00f3n de Lily y su plan para dejar de ser virgen as\u00ed que ofrece su \"ayuda\" en una especie de trato, si bien \u00e9l es experimentado nunca conoci\u00f3 el afecto y eso es lo que pide a cambio. Lily todav\u00eda no conf\u00eda plenamente en \u00e9l as\u00ed que se toma su tiempo en decidirse pero no puede negar que la atracci\u00f3n entre ellos es algo que nunca conoci\u00f3 antes y que no se compara a lo que tiene con su amigo Rey, as\u00ed que ahora debe pensar si se va a arriesgar con Aleksey o tomar\u00e1 el camino m\u00e1s seguro con Rey. Algo que me gust\u00f3 es que al final de cada cap\u00edtulo encontramos poemas, o cartas, o art\u00edculos sobre la guerra, o leyes, y la escritura me sorprendi\u00f3, est\u00e1 muy bien escrito. Es imposible dejar de leer una vez que empez\u00e1s, es excelente, la autora utiliza unos recursos geniales para hacerte creer lo que sucede e incluso hay una escena en particular que me cre\u00ed que estaba pasando en realidad y no lo pod\u00eda creer y despues \u00a1Bam! error, no era as\u00ed. La verdad que me encant\u00f3, me estaba cansando de leer lo mismo siempre (incluso me volv\u00ed exigente con los NA) y este libro fue algo totalmente diferente. \u00a1El romance chicos! es EL ROMANCE. Casi mor\u00ed... de verdad, es taaaaaaaaaaaaaaan lindo que no puedo describirlo. Yo cre\u00ed que hab\u00eda le\u00eddo escenas rom\u00e1nticas (y calientes) bien escritas antes, I WAS WRONG. Y si ustedes creen que leyeron esas escenas bien escritas lean esto o... \u00bfEs una historia fuerte? SI. Pero vale totalmente la pena, el tema de los abusos est\u00e1 bien tratado, es gr\u00e1fico pero no tanto como para darte pesadillas y querer revolear el libro \u00bfentienden?, no llega a tanto y generalmente tampoco es algo que se nos relate literalmente sino que lo sabemos por lo que los personajes dicen o por recuerdos. Los protagonistas son complejos e interesantes, conocerlos lleva su tiempo, no se nos cuenta todo en la primer p\u00e1gina es m\u00e1s hay cosas que no nos enteramos hasta los \u00faltimos 2 o 3 cap\u00edtulos, incluso los secundarios son particulares. Al ser una distop\u00eda hay bastante acci\u00f3n, Lily incluso es parte de un grupo de resistencia contra lo que sucede en la ciudad, no aburre en ning\u00fan momento. En fin, esta historia tiene todo. 4.5 estrellas.

Rather than summarize the plot as some reviews have already done nicely, I want to note a few things. Punto numero uno. The world Miss Robarts created is haunting and a bit scary at times, but it's filled with adventure, and most of all it's original. Next pointer. I love how strong and capable Lila is both physically and mentally. Despite her preconceived notions of others (namely a certain someone whom she catches the eye of), a result of the tragedies she grows up with, she never annoyed me, which is a huge plus in my book. Sure, there were times I wanted to yell at her: JUST GET TOGETHER ALREADY, but for what I got in the end, I wouldn't trade all that waiting for anything. Need I remind you: Which of course brings me to...ALEKSEY! Absolutely gorgeous man. In every way. I would read any book that he's in granted that Miss Robarts writes it! She is able to capture his self confliction, passion, and generous heart (even though he isn't much of a talker (view spoiler) [That is until Lila gives him reason to open up to her! (hide spoiler) ] ) through glances and gestures. In fact, it seems as though all the words she has chosen serve a purpose, whether that is to unfold the plot or shed light on a character. I love this book so much I re-read it a second time the next day and it had me grinning like a fool. Disclaimer! This book is NOT like Pride and Prejudice! I simply related it to this book due to emotional similarities because Aleksey has the ability to make me both die and smile uncontrollably.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more The V Girl takes place in a post-apocalyptic version of North America where war has taken over and the soldiers are given drugs to make them stronger.

When she meets Aleksey she doesn't trust him and somewhat fears him but soon finds herself falling for him no matter how hard she tries to stay away. This book is a coming of age story set in such a horrible environment that most of us couldn't possibly imagine. The idea that it's legal for men to just take whatever they want would certainly put fear into any woman let alone a teenage girl. A completely different world from what we know for the main character to navigate made this an engaging read. Lila is mature beyond her years because of the society she lives in. She knows about sex and has even watched others but the idea of her actually doing it herself is still a scary thing. She's seen rape and fears above anything else that it will happen to her which is touching to imagine what that would be like. She's still a girl to an extant but blossoming upon becoming a woman and trying to find herself all throughout the story. Overall, a well written emotional tale in a horrific environment about a young girl trying to find herself and love. Warning of some graphic content that may bother some on this one.

Not so consuming and more everlasting.\u201d Lila believes in eternal love. She is a fighter; the trait I love the most about her. But very stubborn (no wonder Aleksey calls her brat). She's very desperate on losing her virginity because of awful stuffs occur during recruitment. A voyeur mostly because she wants to erase the memory of her mother being raped. Lol. I think she's a naughty girl sometimes. Overall, this story is about unrequited love. How love can survive during wars. How life makes people the way they are. Family. Friendship. I love Lila's view of love. But I don't think Aleksey's wrong either. He might feel lust at first but they live together.

At first, I was afraid I wouldn\u2019t like this book but when I finally got into it, It was hard for me to put this down. The story was really captivating and it held my attention through out. Lila and Aleksey are wonderful main characters and I find their relationship quite intriguing. This is actually the first book from Mya Roberts and I\u2019m quite impressed with her writing ability and narrating skill. I would definitely look forward to more books from her. Lila Valez is a eighteen year old girl who lives in a cruel world where rape and sexual slavery are legal. In her world, being a virgin is a burden that brings a fate far worse than death so she desperately wants to get rid of it before it was taken by force by the military troops who are yet to arrive for the recruitment. To avoid such horrifying fate, Lila plans to seduce her best friend Rey, the most attractive man in her town. She doesn\u2019t love Rey but besides her father, he\u2019s only man who she\u2019s most affectionate to. Unfortunately, things doesn\u2019t go as she planned because her plan of seduction fails and she has to look for an other way to lose her V card. And then she meets Aleksey, a broody ex-soldier and now an accord cop who protects civilians. Lila hates soldiers after witnessing the horrifying incident of her mother\u2019s rape but something in Aleksey captivates her. She gets irritated with Aleksey who thinks her plans are quite ridiculous and he wants to make a deal with her in exchange for an alternative to her plans. Lila is both tempted and terrified by the offer but it might be her last hope and hence begins their strange relationship which eventually leads to something more. Lila is both innocent and strong character who never gives up hope even if the odds are against her. She\u2019s sweet, caring and very protective of her family. This book has a major character development of Lila who goes through a lots of hard situations that finally make her into a strong woman . Aleksey is broody and mysterious character who has his own secrets to hide. He is so intimidating and I was quite intrigued when I met him for the first time. Lila and Aleksey first meet was hilariously awkward and I can\u2019t say how much I enjoyed it. The romance is super hot and there\u2019s lots of sexual tension between them that has made me fanning myself. Rey is a nice guy but he didn\u2019t stand a chance against the alluring Aleksey. I also liked Lila\u2019s family members especially Lila\u2019s 11 year old cute sister Azzy who is quite witty and doesn\u2019t act her age. I loved the plot! It was well written and never failed to surprise me through out the end. The story moved in a great pace and the surprising twists in the plot along with the suspense has literally made me go crazy. Seriously, I had lots of feels while reading this book and I wish this book wasn\u2019t a stand-alone. The world that the author has created is so fucked up and brutal. I don\u2019t want to imagine myself living in such a violent world where rape and sexual slavery is legal. In this world, the woman are not only the victims for rape but men too. The writing is perfect and the book was told in Lila\u2019s Pov. The main characters as well as supporting characters are well built and well developed. This book brings you not only romance but so much more. Overall, it was disturbingly intriguing and compelling. As I already said this book is for mature readers only and not suitable for everyone, if you\u2019re uncomfortable with rape, sex, slavery, abuse and violence then please avoid this book.

Tackling hard issues such as war, abuse, rape, with a heavy mix of growing up and figuring out your own sexuality, Robarts told a story I am a little frightened to say I loved. Narrated by Lila, an 18-year-old girl in the fractured former United States, I was swept into a well-crafted, difficult and uncertain world that I believed existed entirely. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to squirm and hate and love and rage and scream within a few hundred pages. Quote images kindly provided by the author :) Best and worst The best thing about this book: It both scared me and completely sucked me in. The worst thing about this book: Sometimes it was a little too cryptic, but really I can't think of anything terrible that wasn't intentionally so. First impressions I don't know about you, but I think the cover is gorgeous in a dreamy sort of way. However, it doesn't entirely make sense until you start reading the book and find out what Lila considers the V to mean. But the cover isn't the only reason I decided to read the book. I'm going to chalk that up to the synopsis, which appealed to the dark and twisty part of my brain. The synopsis scared me a little, and it promised a lot of emotion, including\u00a0rage, disgust, fear and...love??? Yup, I had to read the book. Why is it that we seek out books that can make us feel such unpleasant emotions? (Not including the love, that is. Though I do seek out books that will make me giddy and swoon, too.) Plot Mounting danger and the surprises of war made this an exciting book to read, and I was hooked from the first page. The book opens with Lila plotting to seduce her best friend into taking her virginity, as she doesn't want to lose it to a violent, genetically modified, doped up soldier when they come to town for Recruitment. What a way to start off, right? However, when things don't exactly go as planned and certain events shake up her already shaken town, she is saved by a member of the neutral Accords, cops sent by the United Neutral Nations Organisation (UNNO) to ensure civilians are not denied their human rights during America's second civil war. She and Aleksey start to form a tentative and strange relationship based on a shared secret and a set of agreements, but Lila is reminded again and again just how dangerous their relationship is. And Aleksey, stern and intimidating as he is, is not the scariest man in town. Robarts kept the mystery going by introducing terminology, events and exchanges without giving the full details, keeping the reader in suspense until said details were revealed. For example, Lila and Aleksey each made a proposition to the other, but it took several chapters for Robarts to share what terms of the deal were. Ultimately, this was\u00a0a romance novel, so while there was a side plot of rebel activity and sabotage, the main plot focused on Lila and Aleksy. Their growing attraction helped to pull me through the harsher parts of the book. Sure, the ending was almost a little too convenient compared to the rest of the book, but taking the genre into consideration, this was probably the most intense, crazy, scary and, in the end, redeeming romance novel I've come across , so I'm giving it bonus points for that! World-building I was completely absorbed into the war-torn American town and the lives and attitudes of the people who live there. What used to be the United States of America was\u00a0split between the Patriots and the Nationalists, and the war was in its 21st year when Lila turned 18. Robarts built a world of turmoil, fear, bigotry, sadism and religion that I could believe and buy into without any qualms. I was there, and I didn't want to be . I did not want to experience Lila's life as much as I did, as it was infuriating and made me want to wash myself over and over. Excerpts\u00a0from speeches, passages from official documents\u00a0and\u00a0quotes from people within the story at the start of chapters added extra dimensions to the world, indirectly demonstrating the kind of life Lila's family had to live. For example: \"Sexual intercourse with dubious mutual consent is frequent among other animal species. Why deprive the soldiers of a natural inclination?\" Barnabus Kim. Co-Creator of the Patriot DNA Modification Program The one thing I would have liked is more clarity as to who the Nationalists and Patriots were in today's world, or at the very least, what they stood for. However, I imagine that wouldn't have made a difference. In fact, it may have distracted from the story or swayed me to sympathise with one party or another, when the message of the book was\u00a0that, in war, everyone was\u00a0capable of unspeakable acts. Characters and relationships I completely understood Lila. She loved her family fiercely and would do anything for them. She hated and feared soldiers completely and would do anything to avoid them. She had a \"kink\", an act that she repeatedly did, that initially stunned me but was then explained in such a way that I could understand her. Her belief\u00a0about sex\u00a0\u2013that it should be between two people who love each other\u2013 was so at odds with the reality she lived in. Her obsession with\u00a0losing her virginity consensually was something I probably would have had as well if I were in the same situation. Robarts could have made her flat and single-minded, but instead, Lila was so human, uncertain of what to do and going through phases of confidence and fear that really drove her narrative forward. Aleksey scared the hell out of me. He was also seriously alluring. I'm not usually into really big, muscular, brutish men, but Robarts did a hell of a job selling this guy to me while also freaking me out big time. As Lila was drawn to him, so was I. He was just so interesting , a complex character that I never felt like I could truly understand like I could Lila. The mystery surrounding him only added to the desire both Lila and I felt for him. Also, I'm\u00a0pretty sure Robarts used Thor as a base for his character! There was a strange sort of relationship triangle in this book that I hesitate to call a love triangle. Lila tried to seduce her best friend Rey, and this complicated their friendship, leading to a strange dance between them. Aleksey came in as a third dancer, and Lila had to make choices that I don't think she anticipated at all. Robarts walked\u00a0the line between consensual and non-consensual\u00a0acts, illustrating just how scarily blurred those lines can be every day. This is not a simple love story; instead, all three must struggle with what they want and what the world will do to them because of what they want. Lila's family was completely lovable, especially her little sister Azzy. Azzy was so insightful for an 11-year-old, and so blunt, I couldn't help but wish she were my sister. I laughed at a lot of the things she said, as she was quite a witty thing. Despite some of the more adult things she says, I still believed she was 11, simply a clever girl in a world where you have to grow up quickly. Writing The story was told from the first person perspective of Lila. It was well\u00a0written, with Lila's personality shining through and prose flowing smoothly. (Ok, fine, yes, I did find some typos and missing words, but, damnit, I was too absorbed to note them down.) Robarts took no prisoners with this book. She wrote to challenge people's thinking and emotions.\u00a0Through writing about an extreme situation, Robarts highlighted certain things that aren't all that uncommon in our current existence. Firstly, she\u00a0chose\u00a0to set the tale in what used to be the United States. By setting the civil war and associated atrocities there, she brought\u00a0current events to the doorstep of the common American (and other Western nationals). Suddenly, something that was\u00a0happening \"over there\" (e.g. Syria, Sudan, etc.) couldn't\u00a0be dismissed. It was no longer a foreign problem but a local one. The way the Accords acted to \"protect\" civilians made me wonder how so-called protectors and neutral parties are behaving in conflict areas in the real world. Secondly, she spotlighted acts that happen already: Male rape\u00a0(and the devastating effects it can have, especially if it's particularly violent) Rape and murder of women by soldiers when invading a new area Objectification of both men and women by both men and women Bullying I think Robarts did a phenomenal job with The V Girl , as I have never been so desperate to keep reading something that made me feel so many variations of discomfort, rage and, most uncomfortable to admit, desire. Overall Look, this book mentions brutality. Rape. Murder. Actually, not just mentions \u2013 it describes these acts in detail. In between the violence is Lila's desperation for emotional connection and growing sexuality. It's an unnerving combination, and if you feel you can handle it, I strongly recommend reading this book . I am hesitant to say I loved the book, not because I didn't thoroughly enjoy it in a weird way, but because it seems iffy to say you love and enjoy a book that addresses the topics that it does. I'm still trying to process everything I've read! ...more *** I would like to thank Netgalley, Xpresso Book Tours, and the author Mya Robarts, for a free digital copy of this book in exchange for my honest opinion. *** If you are uncomfortable with the subjects of rape, and violence, this book is probably not for you.

It's for mature readers. Imagine living in a world where rape is legal, the sad and scary part is that there are countries that do allow that and nothing is done about it. In The V girl there was another civil war in the United States between the Nationalist and the Patriots somewhere in the future, where rape or Recruitment as the annual event was called, is legal and you can't do much about it or risk being killed or having your family punished. In The V Girl , Lila our protagonist was desperate to lose her innocence. In a different world she would've preferred finding someone to love, getting married and starting a family. But she doesn't get a chance to choose. Its getting closer to the Recruitment day , and finding someone she can trust to lose her innocence to is all she can think off. Her good friend Rey was her first choice, she's known him for most of her life, she trust and cares for him, but Rey doesn't feel like he can do it. She awkwardly meets Aleksey, an ex soldier who is now an Accord cop, watching and protecting civilians. Many cops look the other way when a person is being attacked, they look away or they're taking part in it. Disgusting. In the V Girl there is a lot of sexual and physical abuse, our characters go through a lot of trauma that is considered normal in that world. Lila would do anything to protect her family and to try and stop the recruitments from happening. Lila wants to lose her innocence on her own terms not by force, that way when its time for the recruitment, she feels maybe she'll be ready, I don't think anyone would be ready for that. When we meet Lila , she is on her way to convince Rey to be the One. But she runs into or to be correct falls on Alekseys face. OMG that was hilariously awkward. Her naked butt hits a naked Aleksey in the face. Aaawkwarrrdddd!!!! What a way to start a book. Okay, all jokes aside, Lila was a very mature girl for her age, she's 18 and has to take care of her widowed dad, and her 11 year old twin siblings, Azzy and Olmo. Azzy is also mature for her age, she understands what's going on. Olmo is sick and still acts like an 11 year old boy. Lila has to be strong for her family and for herself, there isn't many people who she can depend on. Surprisingly the scary and intimidating Aleksey is one of those she can. At first I didn't know how I felt about Aleksey . He was intimidating and serious. Usually I like my guy characters like that but those guys are not the same guys from The V Girl. In this book the cops and the soldiers are dark and disturbing, and Aleksey being an ex soldier makes you wonder what he's done in his past. And that's what kept Lila away from him. I noticed that he would always show up where she was. It seemed like he was stalking her, yeah he found her intriguing but sometimes I thought it was creepy. But in the end I did grow to like Aleksey, he isn't like those soldiers, he has a heart and just wanted to do the right thing. There was also Rey . But I think he was always going to be in the friend zone. Lila from the start just didn't want anything more with him. I think he just wanted to be with her once he saw Aleksey was interested in Lila. I feel like Rey was being jealous and territorial. Would he have been a good boyfriend and husband? I think he could, but he would never really love her :-( and that's what Lila needed, security, trust and love. The V Girl was a disturbingly interesting read. I knew that going into this book was going to be difficult but I wanted to know what was going to happen. If things were going to work for the better. I really enjoyed reading this because it was different to what I usually read, it's more realistic. I'm interested in reading more from Mya Robarts, I'm looking forward to that. I recommend this book to mature readers. If your looking to read about a strong, determined, character, stuck in a civil war, with violence and loss and possibly love. I think you should check it out. :-) *** ...more This was a book recommendation and I took it. This is a so called coming of age story in a pre-apocalyptic era.

This is a Out of the box story when two individuals find each other and both fight the attraction. I enjoyed the way the Author gives us moments when they almost do it then stop. The forplay is hot and sexy. Be warned this can be a trigger for some about rape. The Author doesn't go in to too much detail but you know it's happened. I love the other characters as well. They are very well developed and believable. I will definitely read more from this author. ...more This is my first dystopian read in a long time. And it's NA, so pretty unusual, huh?

Why don't you exist, my lovely beast? ...more HOLY SHIT! SOOOO THAT JUST HAPPENED! I don't think that I have ever -in the history of reading books- came across something like this.
