There are too many unexplored and only partially explained things happening. Reading this left me feeling like I went to class but still only earned an 'Incomplete' on my transcript even though I did all the work! Nice beginning, sorta, but is there a completed novel anywhere? :-) ...more This book could have been longer, but it was a fun read. I liken it to an episode of Star Trek: Next Gen. Fast paced,<---M> imminent threats</---M>, hilariously overblown sexism, and a mystery to solve. It wraps up pretty quick (<---B>which I could see how some readers wouldn't like</---B>), but I thought it was great. Would have been five stars if about 2x longer Fun story if a bit outlandish, set up for some great mystery and investigation into an origin story and then felt like the author just gave up and finished up the story. OK but a bit weak in places and with a few plot gaps. There were some interesting ideas but they weren't really explored as the story was over so quickly. Maybe should be re-shelved in the fantasy/magic section rather than sci fi - a little too much on the convenient miracle front. Good Sci-Fi, fast moving and creative.<---A>Scott McElhaney</---A><---C>Scott McElhaney</---C><+++>Vestige</+++>", "Title": "Vestige"},
