Some people will shriek \"No!\" at this, but I really think it's time for Mr Riordan to move on from these stories about young heroes and heroines and Greek/Roman/Egyptian/Norse Gods. At this point, the stories are all starting to blend into one and it feels like his well of ideas has run dry. It's incredibly hard to distinguish Magnus's voice from that of Percy Jackson . It's pretty much the same kid again, with the same wit and snark, he's just been given a different name. Instead of being the son of a Greek god, though, Magnus is the son of a Norse god - a difference that doesn't make the story different enough, but does provide some major info-dumpy moments. Don't get me wrong, Riordan's writing is still easy to read and quite funny. Magnus makes lots of snarky comments to ensure that the book never becomes too serious. But is it enough? Sadly, I don't think so. I guess Riordan has a tried and tested formula that he applies to all his books, but it's starting to show. The Sword of Summer was predictable and none of the characters really stood out - I honestly doubt I will remember their names in a few days time. As much as it will hurt the author's loyal fans, there comes a time when every author must move onto something new. For Riordan, I think it should be now. ALSO: Completely unrelated to the book's content, but that guy on the cover does not look a teenager. In fact, he looks just like Kurt Cobain.

It was amusing, but I didn't particularly care about the characters, and I was bored through most of its 500 pages.

Pre-review: I've heard rumors about a Norse mythology book by Riordan, but only now has it popped up on Goodreads. I'm super excited! It better be as good as Percy Jackson. I hope it has some of this: Actually, I hope this series is better than Percy Jackson, because this time, Riordan has the opportunity to put Loki in it. [image error] [image error] [image error] Yep, I'm having a good time here. No, I'm not going to stop. [image error] [image error] I can't say I'd be disappointed if Captain America happened to show up. Though I don't know why that would ever happen, but I can always hope. [image error] In all seriousness, there's some complex emotional stuff going on with Loki and Riordan will be missing a golden opportunity if he doesn't take advantage of it. [image error] (Yep, this review keeps getting bigger and bigger.) I leave you with this GIF of Loki. Loki everywhere. I don't know what just happened. Exscuse my Lokifest. Edit 9/23/14: IT HAS A TITLE. YAY. ...more This was so much fun! I'm glad this series is in 1st person because Magnus is HILARIOUS and his narration had me laughing throughout. I love the take on Norse mythology, the new cast of characters is fantastic, and I was pleasantly surprised by the direction the story went a few times! Definitely my new favorite first book in a Riordan series. I can't wait to continue the adventure! I'll give Riordan credit for his mythological research, but his writing and characterizations need a lot of work still. Not only does Magnus have the exact same voice and personality as Percy Jackson and Jason Grace , but they all have a weird combination of forced snark and dad jokes that makes them sound more cartoonish than believable--and you need something to ground characters in reality when you have all this magical stuff happening.

While it's great that he's trying to include more diversity with his cast, the fact that the Muslim girl has a shape-shifting hijab seems just as ham-fisted and clueless as when he degraded Nico into a stereotype in the last book . Wait, is this a hint at Riordan's Da Vinci Code -inspired mashup with Dan Brown?! In all seriousness, we do have a new series coming our way and the next book has been announced as well. Those looking for more of a connection to previous books than just <---C>Annabeth Chase</---C> showing up will be disappointed, as it doesn't seem like this series will interconnect the same way that Heroes of Olympus did with Percy Jackson and the Olympians .

Percy Jackson , Heroes of Olympus , Kane Chronicles , and now you can add Magnus Chase to that list of awesome. Why? BECAUSE THE SWORD OF SUMMER WAS FANTABULOUS. In fact, I loved this book so much that I bookmarked all the funny bits + my favourite parts\u2026 which was basically the whole book . Whoops . Just a note: The Sword of Summer is perfectly readable and spoiler free if you have not read any Percy Jackson book . But, it would certainly add to the enjoyment of the novel if you did because in usual Riordan style, there\u2019s some inside jokes here and there. CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE GET ANNABETH CAMEOS ?!?!? She doesn\u2019t have a role in the main plotline of the story but she\u2019s there and as fabulous as she is and I totally flailed each time she popped up. The Percy Jackson and Magnus Chase books do have parallels and similarities , but it didn\u2019t feel like I was just reading the same book with different names. While both books have gods and goddesses and demigods and monsters and badass characters and truck loads of humour\u2026 yet the characters themselves were all very much unique as well as the plotline and world building etc. Talking about Riordan\u2019s out-of-this-world sense of humour, can we just admire it for a while? \u201cCould you do a glamour and turn into something smaller?\u201d I asked it. \u201cPreferably not a chain, since it\u2019s no longer the 1990s?\u201d The sword didn\u2019t reply (duh), but I imagined it was humming at a more interrogative pitch, like, Such as what? \u201cI dunno. Something pocket-size and innocuous. A pen, maybe? The sword pulsed, almost like it was laughing. I imagined it saying, A pen sword. That is the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. EXCUST ME MY HEART JUST STOPPED. RICK RIORDAN, YOU ARE SNEAAAAAKY. \u201cThis is an important battle \u2013 the fire lord Surt, Fenris Wolf. Surely that\u2019s worthy of your attention.\u201d Thor\u2019s right eye twitched. \u201cThat\u2019s a fine offer. Really. I\u2019d love to, but I have another pressing appointment \u2013 \u201d \u201c Game of Thrones ,\u201d Marvin explained. \u201cShut up!\u201d And let\u2019s not forget chapter titles like this: \u201c The Man with the Metal Bra \u201d, \u201c You Had One Job \u201d, \u201c Hearthstone Passes Out Even More than Jason Grace (Though I Have No Idea Who That Is) \u201d (!!!!!) and \u201c How to Kill Giants Politely \u201d. Other than his funny dialogue, one of the strongest aspects of The Sword of Summer is in its diverse set of characters . Samirah al-Abbas, who is Magnus\u2019 Valkyrie, is a young Muslim girl and wears a hijab. She\u2019s in an arranged marriage that she\u2019s happy is happening (she\u2019s in luuuuurve ) and has big dreams for her future. There\u2019s also Blitz (a dwarf) and Hearth (an elf, who also happens to be deaf), and they just bring another level of hilarity to the novel. They pretend to be homeless dudes when they were undercover, looking after Magnus before he was introduced to the whole world of Vikings and monsters and magic. I will say there is ZERO romance in this book, which I did quite like because dammit, not EVERY romance just happens to begin at the start of a series. Thanks for keeping it realistic, Riordan. I do hope there is a romance in the future books, and I can sorta see one (but maybe that\u2019s my crazy fangirl mind speaking) \u2013 we shall see! So why not a full 5 stars? 1. I feel like Magnus character could use some more brushing up and development. I love his goofy snarkiness, but feel as if I don\u2019t know him all that well other than his funny side of his personality. 2. I feel like the last 1/4 to 1/5 was less enjoyable than rest of the book. I felt a little bored, and you can even tell from my bookmarks because there is less in that area. BUT that being said, The Sword of Summer lived up to my expectations and I loved this book through and through. Diverse and lovable characters, complex world-building, hilarious dialogue (in usual Riordan fashion)\u2026 hands down one of my favourite books of 2015. BRING ON BOOK 2. ---- Edit: 31/07/15 GUYS. LOOK. WHAT. I. HAVE. GOODBYE INTERNET. SEE YOU IN A FEW HOURS. Edit: 09/10/14 GUYS WE HAVE A SYNOPSIS: Magnus Chase has always been a troubled kid. Since his mother's mysterious death, he's lived alone on the streets of Boston, surviving by his wits, keeping one step ahead of the police and the truant officers. One day, he's tracked down by an uncle he's never met\u2014a man his mother claimed was dangerous. His uncle tells him an impossible secret: Magnus is the son of a Norse god. The Viking myths are true. The gods of Asgard are preparing for war. Trolls, giants and worse monsters are stirring for doomsday. To prevent Ragnarok, Magnus must search the Nine Worlds for a weapon that has been lost for thousands of years. When an attack by fire giants forces him to choose between his own safety and the lives of hundreds of innocents, Magnus makes a fatal decision. Sometimes, the only way to start a new life is to die... SO MUCH EXCITEMENT. SO IT WAS THE COUSIN. Edit: 07/10/14 My thoughts: Magnus needs to be some close relative of Annabeth's. I highly doubt he'd make Magnus Annabeth and Percy's son, because that would be TOTALLY weird seeing Percabeth all grown up and I'd honestly hate that. So no, let's hope that doesn't happen. We can't forget Annabeth has step-brothers...However, SPOILER FOR THE BLOOD OF OLYMPUS: In the book, Annabeth mentions she has an uncle and cousin in Boston but she doesn't really know them because her dad and uncle don't get along well. WAIT WHAT NOW. The only reason I can see for Rick Riordan to include that is to give us a little hint towards who this Magnus Chase guy is. END SPOILER But regardless, there will have to be Percabeth cameos, right? THERE HAS TO BE. THERE MUST. *nods quickly* Edit: 07/10/14 MAGNUS CHASE.

Okay, fine, I sort of hated The Blood of Olympus , but The Sword of Summer was supposed to be a fresh start-- it was supposed to be the book that would put Riordan back up on my mental pedestal . Well, I've been fucking let down, Rick. I'm sorry (and sad) to have said that, but it's true . This book was just nowhere near the level of epicness I was expecting . Maybe it's Guess who's a very grumpy camper? *points to self* In my own little world, I've always told myself that Rick Riordan can do no wrong. Okay, fine, I sort of hated The Blood of Olympus , but The Sword of Summer was supposed to be a fresh start-- it was supposed to be the book that would put Riordan back up on my mental pedestal . Well, I've been fucking let down, Rick. I'm sorry (and sad) to have said that, but it's true . This book was just nowhere near the level of epicness I was expecting . Maybe it's because, after ten (eleven if you count Greek Gods ) books of kick-butt Greek and Roman mythology, maybe I was just expecting too much. The main thing that made it unenjoyable, at least for me, was its similarity to the original Percy Jackson and the Olympians books, maybe with a little bit of Harry Potter mixed in as well. Let's break it down, shall we? \"I did not want to be the harbinger of the wolf. I wanted to be the harbinger of ice cream, or falafel.\" 1.) Magnus's voice sounded exactly like Percy's . I mean, if you asked me to guess which lines were whose, I wouldn't be able to answer. I might've been okay with it if the sarcastic humor worked with the story, but somehow it didn't. There was just something a bit more... juvenile about the writing style, and it worked with 12 year-old Percy, but not 100% with 16 year-old Magnus . 2.) All the other characters were just so predictable . As with PJO, in The Sword of Summer , we're given a hot-headed female who's clearly the most mature in the group, some really quirky sidekick s and sassy villain s . Notice that I said sidekicks and villains as plural nouns--that's because there're more than one of each, and they all have the same psyche . 3.) The plot was your typical Rick Riordan storyline . See, other than his mid-series cliffhangers, Rick's books mostly do just follow a formula plot. It hurts me to admit that, but yes, it does seem to be the case. You can practically guess the ending without even starting the book. 4.) The mythology twists? I call bullshit at the word \"twists\" --I wasn't surprised at all. We've got really obvious villains, which sucks because they were actually unexpected in the original PJO series. But with this? It's basically spoon-fed to us. SPOON-FED. 5.) This book felt horribly info-dumpy . I NEVER FELT THIS WAY ABOUT THE ORIGINAL PJO SERIES. I'm not even sure why I felt that way with this book... Maybe it's because most of the Norse mythology facts were just inserted (forcefully) into awkward dialogues in huge chunks , and I honestly had trouble following along. I CAN'T REMEMBER A THING, AND IT'S ONLY BEEN A DAY. Phew. So glad I finally got that off my chest. Anyway, despite my ranting, this book wasn't horrible-- there were still some quotes that made me chuckle (especially those lovely chapter headings that we all know and love), parts that made me immensely sad, and parts that made me root for the main characters. And, as usual, Rick's books are just so easy to read. Oh, and bonus points for diversity ! We have a Muslim demigod as our main heroine (I still don't understand how she's both a Muslim yet a server of the Norse gods), as well as an adorable deaf elf as one of Magnus's sidekicks. And with this, I conclude that I did not love The Sword of Summer, but am hoping for a 200% energy boost for the sequel when it comes out. Please make it ten times better.

Upon learning that Rick would be writing this series, I actually went on Wikipedia and proceeded to research all good old Wiki had to offer about Norse gods, from which I learned that Thor cheated on his wife and had a kids with some other goddess, Valkyries are fucking scary creatures with lots of power to blast your ass, and other interesting tidbits like that. Of course, I haven't read that article in a while, so feel free to correct me. Sadly, I think we might be missing out on some of the family drama because this is a children's book, not one of those adult novels that Carl Hiassen writes, and Rick writes too, but I don't think I have those. Ooh, and before we go, I have four more things: 1) Has anyone noticed how many names of gods Rick misspelled in his other series'? I mean, really, it's not like it retracts from the story (because that's still pretty good), but could you bother to spell it right? 2) Rick Riordan lives in Texas and he's writing about NYC. And he frequently gets his geography wrong. But that's okay. I just thought you should know. 3) I would be SUPER EXCITED if he did Japanese mythology too. 4) Does anyone know if he's doing a followup series to Kane Chronicles? Virtual cake to whoever answers the last one. ...more [4.5 Stars] Short Review: I went into this with kinda mixed expectations\u2013\u2013it sounds like Percy Jackson 2.0 (and well ... it kind of is), plus a bunch of my friends were disappointed by it.

I love so many things about this book - the characters, the REPRESENTATION (so many props), the world building, the plot, just everything. It took a little bit to get going and moving, but beyond that was everything I ever want from a Riordan book - humorous, heart-felt, and fun. I can't wait for later books and I really hope we are going to get into more of the 9 realms because YES. OMG, I loved so much the last chapter! Of course Magnus would lose that bet! He needs at least 9 more books to surpass Annabeth, hahaha. Either my sense of fun and humour has wilted into nothingness or Rick Riordan has started to bore me with his repeating usage of storylines and familiar jokes. I opt for the latter. I like to think that I have a good sense of humour - I like to laugh at every single tiny jokes and it takes a lot to snuff out that side of me.

Okay fine, to its credit Magnus Chase and The Sword of Summer is funny (it certainly does has its stupid, ri-donkey-lous moments), but the humour instilled here did not succeed in impressing me - much less made me laugh. Usually when I go into a book written by Rick Riordan, I'd be anticipating for the belly laughter and the blissful fun that comes with it. But instead I end up rolling my eyes to high heavens like where have I heard this joke before? I suppose when you have read more than 10+ books with the same story arcs by THE SAME AUTHOR -\u00a0 one way or another you're going to outgrow them. I turn out to be one of those people and it sucked BIG TIME because I ended up: a) being poker-faced in the entire story. I had no reactions to the jokes (which consists of snarks, witty comebacks and lots of modern pop culture) or the big answer reveals - none. Everything just feel too goddamn repeated. Formulaic and methodical even. b) feeling underwhelmed by the overused plotlines/story arcs. In this book, a prophecy forewarned Ragnarok (end of days) and that a hero will walk into the picture and prevent/postpone that from happpening. So its a cycle, heroes must fight back wrathful gods/monsters who try to destroy them and take over the whole wide world. Yada, yada, yada. You know the drill. Nothing is fucking new here. Moving on. c) feeling annoyed AND bored ... by the overused 'The Chosen Special Snowflake' trope and 1000x other tropes. Gods, Riordan, if only you'd stop with the repetitions! It's getting real old. d) feeling detached from MANY characters here. Something that's never happened to me when it comes to Riordan's books. So the fact that I'm 'not feeling it' really, really blows. Don't get me wrong, each one of the characters here are actually all wonderfully fleshed out well with their own quirks and personalities (I have a HUGE adoration for both elf and dwarf: Hearthstone & Blitz) but they don't feel so fully developed. I hate to compare this to Percy Jackson/Kane Chronicles/The Heroes of Olympus but everything here reads to me like they're all remolded from the previous series only half-heartedly. e) Getting real pissy at the 'question evading' move. QUESTIONS ARE EVADED A LOT HERE. Which is something I notice Riordan has a habit of doing in all his written works. Look, if you want to ground my attention to a story, make sure you don't try to keep frustrating me with the obvious lack of answers . That's what this book does a lot. Whenever Magnus Chase questions something/someone, other people would be on the verge of answering him then suddenly, something else happens and the book will be all... \"Sorry. Your question will have to wait! You'll get your answers soon - just keep reading!\" Talk about getting exasperated, man. f) feeling baffled and unimpressed with the depictions of the Norse gods and goddesses. All myths and legends are laced with grimness and bloodshed but it was never that way here. Everything that's dark and grimy are watered down into a sillier, lighter version. A part of me liked that Thor is a farting, TV show addict but another part of me longed for that kickass, majestic hammer wielding Norse god he was portrayed to be. I truly was expecting something more serious here. I wanted the portrayal of the gods & godesses to be legit. Can't everything and everyone not be made into a laughingstock for once? This is Young Adult, the audiences can handle a bit of seriousness. Let there be more bloodshed! * * * I can never ever come close to hate anything Riordan writes but I can be underwhelmed and let down. Maybe even bored.\u00a0Bummer. However, despite its many not-so-redeeming qualities, there are still a ton of stuffs that I can praise. \u2022 This book deals with DIVERSITY & EQUALITY (in the most unique way possible). Here, we have a muslim female sidekick, Samirah Al-Abbas, who wears a magical(!) hijab and wields some serious axe-slashing skill. Oh, and she's also in an arranged marriage with her twice-removed cousin. Surprise, surprise! Seriously, that don't happen often in many YA books. Eventhough Riordan glossed over the subject, I find it a pleasant thing that he brought it up for his readers. God knows how most of us are almost completely ignorant on that subject. When someone mentions human equality in races - that's seriously great. But here, it's like the author himself has decided to humanize elves, giants and dwarves and that as much as us normal human beings, they deserve not to be excluded out or be stereotyped too. (You'll get what I mean when you read the book) \u2022 The adventures never seem to s-t-o-p. They won't even let you have the liberty to pause and catch your breath because in every chapters, there will always, always be some quest going on despite the fact that Ragnarok is looming around the corner. What makes it most interesting is that these quests are often enlightening. You'll learn a LOT of Norse myths along the way. \u2022 The awesome and ACCURATE imitation of a teenager's lifestyle and voice. We all know Mr Riordan isn't a teenager but I swear, I think he may still be one because he realistically captured how a teenager would sound, behave and act like. The narration that comes from Magnus, a 16 year old, never felt so forced and it was easy for me to be able to just click with him. Also, brace yourself for MANY mentions of modern pop cultures. (Featuring... Taylor Swift) Oh... and TV shows, too. \u2022 The HILARIOUS titles are back in the picture and they're most probably going to make you bend over chortling .To the readers who have loyally followed Riordan's trails for years now will know what I'm talking about. This author is the MAN when it comes to chapter titles. To wrap it up, this book was just fun and silly to read. I'd say educational, too. But other than that, a part of me has decided that it's probably time I outgrow Riordan's books (Hello, maturity!) and move on to a more serious myth-related stories. I will still read Magnus Chase's further adventures but something tells me that the magic and the fun I'd be feeling will not be so much anymore. I'm totally not emotional right now.

Similarity #1 The protagonist is a male sass master that can't be tamed. Similarity #2 Who is motherless because of Norse god-related reasons. She is a lovely lady, and he never knew his father. Similarity #3 His female companion is experienced in the world of Norse mythology and doesn't like our dashing male lead at first. Similarity #4 He travels with two comic relief characters, who are native magical characters a la Grover. Similarity #5 They go on a quest to find a lost, very powerful magical item.

That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.\" PJ reference #3 Jason Grace's name appears in a chapter title. PJ reference #4 The series name: Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard/Percy Jackson & the Olympians. Alright, let's get serious. I may bitch and moan about The Sword of Summer, but the truth is, I really liked it. Sam (Magnus's female questing companion) is a badass Muslim with a hajib and although I'm sure Riordan penned this before the Paris attacks, I'm glad she exists as a positive role model in a climate of Islamphobia. Arranged marriages aren't portrayed as a contract with the devil. These days, most require enthusiastic consent from the bride and groom themselves. It's more like a blind date, except it's your parents talking up his job and house. Annabeth's appearances are kept to a minimum, which is a relief. I laughed out loud on more than one occasion and enjoyed learning about Norse mythology. Reading Riordan's stuff is like slipping on a pair of comfy old sneakers. Am I proud of it? No. Riordan is capable of so much more than a formula of random mythology, juvenile humor, and contemporary references. (Btw, love the nod to Taylor Swift. What? I'm a huge fan) I want him to do something totally different. I want to stop writing Percy Jackson books, dammit, and set a new story in a new universe. But I guess I'm destined to be a hypocrite because I can't wait to get my hands on The Hammer of Thor . Blurb reveal : Is it just me or does this sound a hell lot like Percy Jackson? Troubled kid, son of a god, ancient enemies are stirring, must find a magical object or the world will end... Still gonna read it (duh), but it makes a girl wonder. Pre-review: Hmm... I was hoping for a girl narrator, but I have a feeling we'll be seeing Annabeth and Percy. Oh, God, give me the boy. later on, so that's forgiven. Hopefully, Magnus can redeem his name from another fictional character from a series I'm not very fond of. And some of this would be lovely: ...more *I received this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review* 4.5 stars I knew he was planning on making a Norse series but here it is! Or, rather, the vague idea roaming around on Goodreads that sometime in 2015 there might be a book about Norse mythology by Riordan. Or maybe in a few years after that....Well, Just hope it's more like the Percy Jackson than the Kane Chronicles. But I really hope that Loki, if he is brought up and we all know he will be, is not a generic villain. Please? He (and Thor) BETTER NOT be teenagers. Hell, no.

I mean, it's Rick Riordan, right?! So you expect that...but I think this is one of his most goldenest books for humour ever (although granted I haven't read The Kane Chronicles yet, so we'll see how they match up!). Basically I'm endlessly pleased with this hilarious novel of Magnus Chase. It felt different from Percy Jackson, but still had the same vibe and hilarity (!!) and also ANNABETH HAS A CAMEO. Magnus Chase is Annabeth's cousin. Sh That was HILARIOUS. Like incredibly, marvellously FUNNY. I mean, it's Rick Riordan, right?!

Basically I'm endlessly pleased with this hilarious novel of Magnus Chase. It felt different from Percy Jackson, but still had the same vibe and hilarity (!!) and also ANNABETH HAS A CAMEO. Magnus Chase is Annabeth's cousin. She hasn't got a big part, nope, but she's there and it's makes me pleased. Ohhh, but WHERE TO START!! All I want to do is fangirl basically. But let me be logical here. I CAN DO THIS. How about a list?! THAT SHOULD HELP. THE REASONS WHY THIS BOOK IS JUST DOWNRIGHT FABULOUS: + Magnus Chase. He's a dork. He's really dramatic and funny and so so sarcastic. He has a sarcastic comeback for everything and it's just so fun to read. He's also really laid back. So yeah, he's dead -- okay dude, let's deal. Oh and now he has some cool powers -- got this. And let's just add in a going to a crazy Norse afterlife -- chillin'. + THE CHAPTER TITLES. I loved them. They're ridiculously funny. Like \"I Do Combat with Eggs\" and \"We Are Falafel-Jacked By An Eagle\" and \"We Have a Pre-Decapitation Party, with Egg Rolls\" and \"Don't Be a No-bro, Bro\". Excuse me, I must giggle. + The gods are equally quirky and insane and kooky as in the PJO books. Thor is a TV addict. He bypasses crushing an enemy to catch up with Game of Thrones, basically. And Odin sucks at giving speeches. One of the villainous monsters is a weird bag-lady. + And there's actually no romance. NONE, PEOPLES. NOT A SCRAP. Which is just...weird. I was really, really surprised... Of course Magnus' buddy is Samirah al-Abbas, but she's in love with someone else! SO YEAH. How's that?!? + But we gotta speak about the CHARACTERS! Of course! So Magnus' dorky sass is complimented by Samirah al-Abbas' seriousness and dedication to her job. She's a Valkyrie, so she guides heroes into the afterlife (I think is the jist of things) except it's so dubious whether Magnus is actually a hero or not that...she kinda gets in trouble. bUT ENOUGH OF THAT. Sam is epic! She's a daughter of Loki, so she's got heaps of abilities, but she swears never to be beguiling like her dad. She's also prone to punching Magnus. Also she's Muslim and wears a hijab sometimes, which is also magical. + And Magnus has these two buddies, homeless dudes, who are just HILARIOUS. Like they're not really homeless dudes, of course, but a dwarf/elf in disguise who protect Magnus. Um, kind of protect? They slapped a monster in the face a sign about ducks?? So kinda helpful? ANYWAY. One of them loves designing clothes and the other is deaf. SO THAT'S COOL. (Except, I have to admit, the deaf guy isn't at all realistic, because he gets everything everyone is saying. He signs, but no one else does. Dude, I'm sorry, but reading lips is woefully inaccurate and hard. SURE he's a magical being, but it's not realistic.) So, it kind of has similarities with Percy Jackson? But I didn't even mind! Just there's a battle girl (daughter of Odin) who is so like Clarisse, and then Sam was a little like Annabeth (though I thought Magnus was pretty different from Percy!) OH OH and of course the plot is: here is a quest, go meet monsters, go fulfil it. But I laughed so much and enjoyed it a lot I didn't even mind! My only quibble is: it's too long. I really HONESTLY think there are too many plot detours that, while they might be entertaining, they're not actually adding to the plot. I did get a bit bored in the last 1/3. I like concise books, is all. ANOTHER SOLIDLY FANTASTIC RIORDAN BOOK! This brings my Riordan eating-ness up to 11 books! I'm quite addicted. And while this is YA (Magnus is 16) I totally think it still suits a younger audience too. It's funny and exciting and really creative and I learnt SO MUCH about Norse mythology! (Apparently Loki isn't brothers with Thor?! And I didn't even KNOW a god called Frey existed, so yeah. Fabulous.) I CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE. And it doesn't have a horrific cliffhanger, so I feel quite calm to wait for the next book. HUZZAH, THANK YOU FOR SPARING MY DELICATE FEELS, RICK RIORDAN. *** QUOTES OF AWESOMENESS*** ...beware, these are from an ARC copy so may not be finalised versions... \"Give me one answer,\" I said. \"One clear answer, without the rambling and the history lectures. You said you knew my dad. Who is he?\" Randolph placed his hand over mine... \"On my life, Magnus, I swear this is the truth: your father is a Norse god. Now, hurry. We're in a twenty-minute parking spot.\" \"Then why don't you just say A.D.?\" \"Because Anno Domini, in the Year of our Lord , is fine for Christians, but Thor gets a little upset. He still holds a grudge that Jesus never showed for the duel he challenged him to.\" \"Say what now?\" \"could you do a glamour and turn into something smaller?\" I asked it. \"Preferably not a chain, since it's no longer the 1990s?\" The sword didn't reply (duh), but I imagined it was humming at a more interrogative pitch, like, Such as what? \"I dunno. Something pocket-sized and innocuous. A pen, maybe?\" The sword pulsed, almost like it was laughing. I imagined it saying, A pen sword. That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. HA I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE RICK RIORDAN. \"Back up,\" I said. \"What did Sam mean by again ? You've lost your hammer before?\" \"Once,\" Thor said. \"Okay, twice. Three times if you count this time, which you shouldn't, because I am not admitting that the hammer is missing.\" \"I, at least, will make sure you get a proper trial before the thanes cast your soul into Ginnungagap!\" Samirah and I exchanged glances. We didn't have time to be captured and sent back to Asgard. I definitely didn't have time to get my soul cast into a place I couldn't even pronounce. ...more Rick can't do wrong. Another adventure of epic proportions lead by the incredibly sarcastic Magnus is not \"just another\" Percy Jackson, but a distinctive and a little bit more grown-up journey featuring dwarves, elves, Valkyries and of course, the master of mischief Loki and his many godly opponents.

It's a fun story really, almost perfectly summed up by the ending as; \u2018I considered everything I\u2019d been through \u2013 death and resurrection, fishing for the World Serpent, fighting with giants, running from monster squirrels, binding a wolf on a disappearing island\u2019 BUT -with a quick look at all the other reviews, Goodreads clearly must add the Half Star to the ratings.- My rating is just 3.5, -to give it 4 is too much for my overall liking- It's 2.5 Story , 3.5 Characters , 4.5 insightful look into the Norse Myths and Gods. -which was better than the Marvel Movies insight in a way.- But again that isn't fair putting it that way, the story has some good points, and many weak ones.. So does the characters, some are strongly written and some just normal. And here ,and so later, I must say drawing a Muslim Girl in this kind of fantasy is extraordinary perfectly written ,one of the points that made me love the series more.. This amazing drowning can be found in this lovely blog So let's see why it was a real \u2018Roller Coaster\u2019 as I said in the beginning of this review, let's see What was Up and what was Down\u2026 DOWN **Meet Magnus ,& his street friends ,but Mind all the sarcasm. reminded me strongly of Percy Jackson in the first few pages I have read for him..,I may used to his sarcasm later, may found some of it funny later..but that wasn't that good starting. So from now on...I'll try to Review it as Magnus.. UP **Oh, he's a Demigod -Perrrrcyyyy- Thanks to his Uncle's insightful speech of the Norse Gods. The speech and the theory of the Viking discovered North America first is interesting, and the Boston history, I just love it. -specially I've read this theory in a Donald Duck comic adventure by Carl Barks back in the 50s. \u201cMyths are simply stories about truths we've forgotten.\u201d DOWN **That's how to get a 2000 years lost Sword??? **A Catastrophic Fire Giant Fight in the middle of real world???? **Oh, and the Agony Death to complete the day !, just as promised. UP **Welcome to the Hotel Valhalla , Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place), Such a lovely faaaaceee. Though it wasn't my cup of coffee to read a dead character story ,but hey it's ancient Gods story , so suck it.. **A Tour in the Norse Heaven\u2026 I loved how Uncle Rick made it so vivid. **The Valkariy Samirah al-Abbas and the disastrous dinner. Sorting Hat anyone? Still UP **Plenty of room at the Hotel Valhalla, Any time of year (Any time of year),You can find it here. I just loved the Norse myth and how Rick Riordan take us there professionally , Yet I have this unsettling feeling.. \"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell\" But still , I just like the variety of the company, also liked that you can always break the rules and leaving the Hotel\u2026 got too much potential but alas, it didn't put in use just 2,3 chapters later.. And she said \"We are all just prisoners here, of our own device\" **Oh ,and here comes Loki. DOWN **Escaping Hotel California, sorry, Valhalla.. **The Truth of Magnus\u2019 Friends, the Elf and the Dwarf. I just used the characters of the hotel, you know, the crazy half naked Viking ,and the smart sarcastic a bit girl\u2026 well\u2026 at least Samirah will be there. **Attending the funeral..of himself. UP **The Quest; Magnus, you must find the Sword, God knows where now,and you must Stop the Norse Armagadone ,by restraining a Wolf God knows how, in an Island that only appear in , whatever he got only Nine Days, God knows where.. And remember...every one tell you any lead you must pay certain cost, Gods Knows How.. sometimes they themselves who ask for that DOWN **...said a severed head, sorry, a God ! **A Giant Eagle in a Food Court, Kidnapping Magnus. Too much weird fantasy in real world...I love things more like, Ministry of Magic secure if you know what I mean.. UP **I -Me ,really- love Samirah al-Abbas. The author really wrote it very well and very respectfully to the real moderated Muslim's lifestyle. Total respect. 2 of my best friends here -real YA, Big RR fans- told me the author researched deeply in the Muslim books to get understanding terms for Samirah , and I gotta say that though the flying Hijab was a bit too much, but otherwise I just can't appreciate the author enough.. PS: A novel later, Ink and Bone, has also a Muslim girl, smart and good and all...but just not as real as here. **oh , and Hearthstone is quite fine too. Still UP **Go Fisihing the World Serpent. **Meet a freaky geeky collector Goddess. Magnus was really smart here. **The Tree of Learadr DOWN **Hello, MILF, sorry, Aunt. Who also my best friend\u2019s Mom. **The Dwarfs contests and Rules are the most ridiculous thing ,ever. Blitz can be my least favorite character , his obsession about fashion so overused. **And again, more enemies for live.. **A Talking Sword, A Talking Sword... UP **Loki again, in the most disgusting set. I honestly love the information about the Norse ancient myths. **And meet The Funniest Talking Goat ever.. Creepy, funny, depressed goat ever...just kill it, sorry ,like it. , reminded me a bit with Shrek's Donkey. & **Have you met Thor? DOWN **Okay ,Thor is not the movies\u2019 handsome macho hot guy...we get it, but you don't need to keep fart it. Really horrible. **KILLING GIANTS SISTERS AT THEIR HOME. No matter what happened, no matter what their other sister did, no matter a damn thing that was stupid and brutal and not Good Middle Grade or even YA read. **GUESS WHAT, TALKING SWORDS CAN'T SEE A JACK. Still DOWN ** MORE Giants Killing. No seriously, at least George R.R. Martian has a point writing the Red Wedding @ A Storm of Swords.. I have to admit, through all the ups and downs ,the part of the giants is the thing that really really stopped me rate it more than 3. I Understand killing a Giant trying to drown a God!!!! , but plotting an escape by killing a whole family in their home is just the ridiculous of all. UP **The Hummer of Thor is...spoiler. and A NETFLEX. Thor is so fun , I strangely find I just like him in some things.. \u2018Won\u2019t you come with us? This is an important battle \u2013 the fire lord Surt, Fenris Wolf. Surely that\u2019s worthy of your attention.\u2019 Thor\u2019s right eye twitched. \u2018That\u2019s a fine offer. Really. I\u2019d love to, but I have another pressing appointment \u2013\u2019 \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019 Marvin explained. \u2018Shut up!\u2019 Thor raised his staff over our heads. Oh, Marvin is the Goat I told you about. UPs & DOWNs , Right & Left ** The Climax, the Wolf, The back of the hall mates, The Dome theory , the prolong anti-climax\u2026 and Who's the Hell is Annabeth ,and why should he lose the bet? Did she a fan of Game of Thrones too and watched \u2018em all? Okay ,yes after I finish it I got it that Annabeth is a Percy Jackson character , so I lose a bet. The ending is sure mostly Up more than Down\u2026 but wasn't high enough due to some of the very down hell. Finally ----- Even if I didn't appreciate some of the over-doused fantasy here -Oh no, I may be really getting older :(- I still loved the insightful look into the Myths of the Norse.. And I have to thank my dearest friends here Malak and Raoofa for encouraging me to this world ,Worlds, of Rick Riordan...the all ancient Gods Master.. And one final small thing\u2026 wasn't cool at all bringing Jesus to the Gods of Asgard\u2026 I mean just why? , why not one of the Greek Gods, Egyptian ones or whatever. \u201cBecause Anno Domini, in the Year of Our Lord, is fine for Christians, but Thor gets a little upset. He still holds a grudge that Jesus never showed up for that duel he challenged him to.\u201d \u201cSay what now?\u201d Anyway, As I said at the beginning, it was A Breakneck, Jam-Packed Roller Coaster of an Adventure.. Comes Complete with a variety of characters, some are awesome written, some are good enough and some are, just Jack. And I am really waiting for book Two...and wishing the Roller Coaster takes me Up and Down more, but just Keeps me feel Higher all the time.

In truth, there are very few thing you need to know about The Sword of Summer . I'll try to recap them for you as briefly and clearly as possible: 1) Does Riordan use and reuse all the schemes he already used in Percy Jackson and the Olympians , The Heroes of Olympus and the Kane Chronicles ? Yes, and you all already knew that, so no need for me to linger on the topic. 2) Does Magnus Chase resemble, for attitude and personality, Percy Jackson? Ok, really, who actually gave himself an answer to this question different from 'yes'? 3) Did I hopelessly fall -again- for his sense of humor just as I fell for Percy's? Hell (lol) yes! 4) Do I give a darn about Mr Riordan's repetitiveness as long as he manage to make me double up with laughter? Absolutely no! If you are looking for something different , people, don't pick up this book. But if you're looking for an intelligent , well-written , impossibly funny and hilarious middle-grade book, with characters so realistic, complex (clearly, as much as a character can be in a book meant primarly for children) and easy to connect with, and so fast-paced as to not give you time to catch you breath, then this (or any other Riordan's book, for that matter) is your best choice. The only thing that bothered me a little concerns the characters: there are really many, and maybe that's the reason why I struggled to make myself care for those who appear the least, who coincidentally where also the ones I was most curious about, namely the Valhalla Hotel gang , as I call them: TJ, Mallory, Halfborn and X -and do we want to talk about that plot twist? X, seriously? It hadn't crossed my mind not even by mistake. I hope to find them again and more in the next books. I completely loved, instead, the components of the group that follow Magnus in his quest; they were kind of fresh in Riordan's inventory, and each of them came with a solid background story, so I have nothing to hold against them. Of these, Sam was not exceptional in terms of characterisation, but Hearth and Blitz , the elf and the dwarf, are marvellous. It broke me that they probably won't be in the next instalments, or at least not as much as they were in this one. I still hope Riordan decides to give them an adequate space. And the villains! I swear I will kill someone if The Hammer of Thor does not bring me more Loki . We want Loki . Loki is my king. And yes, he's so cool that from now on every time I write his name I'll write it in bold. Like, Loki . And to go out with a bang, another little pearl. It's not properly a quote, but a chapter title. If you never read Riordan, really, people, you can't even imagine what this man can do with a pen in his hand and a chapter without a title. He redefines the concept of chapter title. Like the masterpiece we see at the beginning of chapter forty-eight: \"Hearthstone Passes Out Even More than Jason Grace (Though I Have No Idea Who That Is)\" ...more jam! it did take a bit for me to actually get into the story and i don't think anyone can say that riordan's novels aren't at least a little formulaic, but the cast of characters is refreshing and the plot is non-stop (*sings hamilton in my head*). i think the book gets better the more you read and by the end, i was sad to see it was over. also, i cried at the last handful of chapters. i'm a huge mess sorry. \u201cMy name is Magnus Chase. I\u2019m sixteen years old. This is the story of how my life went downhill after I got myself killed.\u201d So I think The Sword of Summer is the revised edition of Percy Jackson. Everything feels the same way, Magnus reminds me of Percy and Valhara as Half blood camp. I couldn't stop comparing these two books while I was reading though, it gave me my first impression when I first read Percy Jackson. It's hilarious, delightful and engaging a lot I can't peel my eyes of the book \u201cMy name is Magnus Chase. I\u2019m sixteen years old.

It fascinates me to no end to be gradually pulled into this world. Yet Rick doesn't stop at throwing many things to my face and let those characters do their quests, he has a trick up his sleeve and he put the layers into his book. Every characters is endearing. Every quest keeps me wondering what will happen next or what if he fails ? My mood was up and down all the time I spent reading. It surpassed all of my expectation since the first chapter and I wouldn't give it less than 4 stars because it's so good and seemingly wonderful. I dare say this book is special. Rick Riordan knows what he has to do to impress his fans. If you are a die hard fan of him, read it ! But if it's your first book of RR, give it a chance and it won't let you down.

Vale, est\u00e1 muy interesante que Magnus sea hijo de un dios, que no lo sepa y se encuentre en un mundo desconocido donde resulta que es importante, tiene poderes extraordinarios que a\u00fan no sabe utilizar y se ve metido en todo tipo de problemas (wow, sorpresa, Rick Riordan NUNCA HA HECHO UNA HISTORIA PARECIDA). Pero alej\u00e1ndonos de eso, este libro carece de trama. Digamos que el libro se divide en secciones. 50 p\u00e1ginas para buscar X objeto en la guarida de X criatura, 25 p\u00e1ginas para decidir qu\u00e9 hacer respecto a X objeto, 2 cap\u00edtulos para que X personaje muestre X cosa... Es decir, no es algo fluido y se diferencian perfectamente las escenas . El problema es que si quitas la mitad de ellas, la novela sigue teniendo fuerza y sentido. No es que tengan que visitar a Pepito para que les d\u00e9 un objeto importante que les revelar\u00e1 un misterio importante. No. Tienen que visitar a Pepito con un motivo absurdo de f\u00e1cil soluci\u00f3n, pero OH, Pepito les ordena hacer otra cosa. Hacen otra cosa (rellenamos unos cuantos cap\u00edtulos), le comunican a Pepito que lo han hecho, y Pepito les dice: uf, ahora ten\u00e9is que ver a Juan. Y van a ver a Juan. Y volvemos a repetir la estructura. Es decir: no hay algo que una todo. Lo hay pero es un motivo tan vano y encima cambiante que sinceramente no entiendo cu\u00e1l es la meta de los personajes. Durante la primera mitad de la novela lo soportas, m\u00e1s que nada porque el protagonista est\u00e1 entrando al mundo, tiene una especie de rutina donde va aprendiendo sus poderes, entrena, vamos conociendo personajes... Toda la parte del hotel es sublime y rebosa originalidad. Pero una vez salimos de ese espacio realmente interesante, la estructura se repite y repite sin parar. Y al final ha llegado un momento donde me he cansado y se me ha hecho cuesta arriba. \u00bfDe verdad era necesario que Thor comentase series como Juego de Tronos? No lo creo, y de nuevo, rellenamos un cap\u00edtulo. En l\u00edneas generales he disfrutado mucho del libro. Me ha gustado la inmersi\u00f3n al mundo aunque no presente nada nuevo ni en historia ni en estructura, es decir, que Riordan NO arriesga y juega en terreno conocido. Los dioses n\u00f3rdicos son interesantes aunque hab\u00eda demasiadas incongruencias (los dioses menos importantes eran m\u00e1s fuertes que los importantes, etc). El personaje de Magnus me ha gustado aunque se ha visto eclipsado por los secundarios como Sam, Blitz o Hearth. La din\u00e1mica de grupo me gustaba aunque al final me agobiaba estar pendiente de tantas acciones y conversaciones. Continuar\u00e9 con la saga aunque termino con otra sensaci\u00f3n distinta a la que esperaba tener al empezarlo. Tras pasar el ecuador la cosa se puso un poco complicada, y aunque lo le\u00eda con las mismas ganas, ya estaba algo cansado. No s\u00e9. Espero que la segunda parte mejore esa estructura, porque de verdad que me pon\u00eda nervioso. ...more I gave up at the point where the homeless kids shot some giant fire destruction daemon type thing with a plastic cupid bow and arrow. I mean, seriously? That actually happened? That ruined it for me. I\u2019m all up for humour in books, but when the humour seeps into what I consider a serious situation of life and death, it becomes a little bit too stupid. It just didn\u2019t feel real. Bare with me a moment here. There is a giant fire daemon that has emerged in an otherwise normal world, there\u2019s nothing I gave up at the point where the homeless kids shot some giant fire destruction daemon type thing with a plastic cupid bow and arrow. I mean, seriously? That actually happened? That ruined it for me. I\u2019m all up for humour in books, but when the humour seeps into what I consider a serious situation of life and death, it becomes a little bit too stupid. It just didn\u2019t feel real. Bare with me a moment here. There is a giant fire daemon that has emerged in an otherwise normal world, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but the danger didn\u2019t feel real. Okay, so the protagonist may die in the encounter, though it wasn\u2019t a real death. It was more of a case of \u2018Oh, I\u2019m dead. This is cool. Let\u2019s see what happens next. It might me fun. I\u2019m a stupid teenager btw. I\u2019m like, totally, self-absorbed. I\u2019m that awesome that I don\u2019t even care that I\u2019m dead. Screw you world. \u2019 There wasn\u2019t really any sense of seriousness about it. If I was fighting some evil hell type spawn, I would like to think I wouldn\u2019t act with a high degree of nonchalance. It\u2019s like the protagonist shrugs his shoulders and doesn\u2019t give a fuck about his imminent death. It made the situation a little bizarre. Magnus is your typical sarcastic teenager. He\u2019s the type that has nothing but shitty comments up his sleeve and stupid innuendos. We all know the kind of guy I mean, and on a personal level, I find this type of personality rather annoying. I certainly don\u2019t want to read an entire book where this douche bag is the narrator. No thank you. So I gave up. I wasn\u2019t going to waste my time finishing a book I knew I\u2019d dislike. The writing isn\u2019t bad. It is heavily character driven. But, when you don\u2019t like the said character then you know this isn\u2019t going to work for you. It\u2019s only going to get worse as time goes on. I also found the idea of Magnus being the decedent of some ancient Norse God a little bit crappy. It\u2019s the type of idea I\u2019d expect to see in some lame-ass b movie on the science fiction channel. The blending of ancient history with a modern world has always seemed a little bit forced to me, and, well, a little bit cheesy . There are few things I\u2019d like to read less than a story about a moronic teenager being gifted with random ancient powers that he doesn\u2019t understand or deserve. I like my history in the past. And I like my characters with redeeming personalities, not flat in their singular defensive attitude. Gosh\u2026..I hate teenagers like this. This author is sooooooooooooooooo not for me . Judging by the blurbs of his other books, and comparisons by other reviewers with his previous books, all his stories are pretty much based on this single idea. I won\u2019t be reading anything else by Rick Riorden in the future because I know I will dislike it. Never again will I try his books, I\u2019ve got better things to read. ...more OMG no puedo esperar para el siguiente libro, solo porque quiero ver esa conversaci\u00f3n entre Annabeth y Magnus.
