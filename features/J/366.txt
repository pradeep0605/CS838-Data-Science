Imagine a large room, books stacked floor to ceiling - everything you've read. Now imagine outside of that room all of the books that you will never read - they line the halls, choke the doorway and cascade down the front steps to a sea of tomes that looks endless down the street. As a reader, those books are as good as having never been writ. You can know of them, but without sampling between the covers you can't really know them.<---F> Now imagine the Alexandria library</---F>. Before Caesar puts the torch to it. All those books,<---M> all that knowledge</---M>, those stories. And then it is gone. We can mourn the loss of those books, but what do we really long for? The potential? We don't know what they contained. We just want to make that loss personal. Like all those books we won't ever read. I've resigned myself to the fact that I probably will never read all of Dickens, and to me, they may as well have been in that Alexandrian blaze. Reading is an adventure in solipsism, a personal quest that we can occasionally run parallel with others, but in the end what we decide to read - and how we receive it - is uniquely our own. If you are with me so far, then you are in the No, and you are aware that your reading life isn't just everything you have read, it's everything you won't read - whether by conscious decision or by running out of time. In his brilliant un-novel, Vila-Matas wants to add to the \"legion of No\" those authors, like Bartleby, that Preferred Not To. Some wrote a novel, or two or three, and then stopped writing for a long time, some of them forever. Others are novelists that never wrote. Is that such a thing? Does an author need a book to become as such? Vila-Matas's hunchbacked narrator shares with the reader his footnoted Bartlebyan thesis of the No, and when you read this book, you just might come away with re-definitions, new filters. I know I did. ...more 5 stars for the idea. 5 stars for the execution. 5 stars for the lasting consideration that will haunt my reading. 5 stars for the ones many of you won\u2019t (<---B>and, perhaps, shouldn\u2019t</---B>) give it yourself.

The answer, the only answer that occurs to me just now, is that it\u2019s something else, something that might be a blend of all the preceding options, and we might have before us a twenty-first-century novel, by which I mean a hybrid novel, a gathering together of the best of fiction and journalism and history and memoir. I\u2019d be surprised if I was the only reader who speculated , while reading, on whether or not this was a novel (it is; it clearly is). That said, I found and continue to believe, future editions of B&Co. would serve readers well with the inclusion of a bibliography and index.

I agree. But I would like him to wait and read this 2000 first published book by a Spanish author, Enrique Vila-Matas, Bartleby & Co. Why? Because it is all footnotes! This is a book of footnotes so there are no chapter numbers or headers but only numbers at the beginning of each sub-story. Each sub-story is about a writer he claims to be a \"Bartleby\". A Bartleby writer is one that has written a brilliant book and then either does not write again or rests for a long long time. A Bartleby can also be a person who everybody knows can write beautifully but, for a reason only known to him or her, chooses not to. People would ask a Bartleby writer these kind of questions: \"Why are you not writing?\" (full of concern), \"When will we finally see your next book\" (full of eagerness), or saying something like: \"You know, you should write a book!\" (full of encouragement). It covers most of my favorite authors. Thank God I've read some of them so I was able to relate to this book. However, most of them are non-Americans so Harper Lee is not included but Vila-Matas did not forget to include J.D.Salinger. In fact, his footnotes are 2 or 3 and it was towards the end and so I waited and waited and I was, luckily, not disappointed since those footnotes are very moving. Marguerite Duras is there and she says it all with this line: \"To write is also not to speak. It is to keep silent. It is to howl noiselessly.\" Beautiful. Richard Brautigan is there before he shoots himself of course. Anthony Burgess. Juan Rulfo and his Pedro Paramo . Franz Kafka, discussed in length. The book also made me want to read Robert Musil soon. I would also like to share a passage in this book. This one is the footnote about Schopenhauer Derain: \"Bad books are an intellectual poison that destroys the spirit. And since most people, instead of reading the best to have come out from different periods, limit themselves to reading the latest novelties , writers limit themselves to the current narrow circle of ideas, and the public sink ever deeper into their own mire.\" But my favorite is the one from the footnote for Oscar Wilde who says: \"When I did not know life, I wrote; now that I know its meaning, I have nothing more to write.\" There are just too many of these mind-boggling passages. Bottomline, a very innovative approach in storytelling. A must read if you like style in what you read. Interesting stories about your favorite literary authors too. Just make sure that you know some of those obscure Latin American ones because they tend to be unfamiliar to me since I do not know their language. Thank God for the translators. ...more According to Enrique Vila-Matas there's a Literature of the No which doesn't exist but is still very important.

Always harboured the suspicion, which turned into conviction, that there is a series of books which form part of the history of the No, though they may not exist. These phantom books, invisible texts, are the ones that knock at our door one day and, when we go to receive them, for what is often a trivial reason*, they disappear; we open the door and they are no longer there, they have gone. (*perhaps to borrow a cup of sugar) This book is a straight-up wannabeBorges, and I can appreciate that because Borges is a great writer, so who wouldn't, if they have something of the total book geek about them, wish to emulate the old omniscience. This book even starts from a good place, because I'm a great fan of Herman Melville's great story Bartleby. But the idea of the Literature of the No just falls apart like a badly stitched Frankenstein experiment. These writers who declined to write \u2013 most of the time it wasn't because of some grand philosophical gesture : \"I could write, but writing, it is now impossible, in this modern world, after [atrocity of your choice]\", not some dramatic Duchampian abandonment of art for chess or revolution. It was because they took to drink or had a brain injury or discovered sex or went round the twist and were shut up in asylums or disappeared in Mexican water or Guinean jungles or they had a career change and became full time acrobats or chemical plant executives. Or ran out of inspiration. So, you know, who cares about these mopes?

Dick Stephan Zweig, Mija\u00edl Bulg\u00e1kov y John Williams, entre otros, a quienes no hab\u00eda le\u00eddo por desconocimiento, falta de tiempo o por terminar de leer la obra de mis preferidos como Dostoievski o Kafka. Hay libros que me llevar\u00e9 en el coraz\u00f3n cuando este 2016 termine. Algunos de ellos, Ulises (mi mayor desaf\u00edo como lector), El Caballero que cay\u00f3 al Mar, Niebla, Novela de Ajedrez, Stoner, Ubik, 1984, Jane Eyre, Almas Muertas, Los Hermanos Karamazov, El Maestro y Margarita (el mejor que le\u00ed este a\u00f1o) y \u00e9ste libro de Enrique Vila-Matas. Lo de Vila-Matas es genial. En este libro escrito como una mezcla entre la novela, el diario y el ensayo he podido repasar a tantos autores (y personajes) que encajan dentro del s\u00edndrome de Bartleby, el famoso personaje de Herman Melville, quien formara parte de una extensa listas de escritores del No. \u00bfA qu\u00e9 se refiere el autor cuando los denomina de esa manera? Bueno, siguiendo la famosa frase del copista de Melville, \"Preferir\u00eda no hacerlo\", Vila-Matas enumera una gran cantidad de autores que por alguna raz\u00f3n abandonaron la literatura de diversas maneras. Para ellos se vale de un gran estudio e investigaci\u00f3n ahondando en la historia de la literatura y lo demuestra con gran maestr\u00eda. Por su libro, compuesto de distintas entradas de un diario ficticio o notas al pie de un libro inexistente, el autor nos enumera una lista muy variada, comenzando por los mas famosos, como Juan Rulfo y su falta de inspiraci\u00f3n a causa de la muerte de su \"t\u00edo Celerino\", pasando por J.D. Salinger y su reclusi\u00f3n de treinta y dos a\u00f1os, Arthur Rimbaud, quien abandonara todo desde muy joven para dedicarse a cualquier cosa menos escribir, la lista se extiende a Robert Walser y su desmoralizaci\u00f3n kafkiana, al mism\u00edsimo Franz Kafka, quien siempre se mantuvo al borde del parate total y desvar\u00edo por sus contradicciones literatura versus oficina versus matrimonio versus existencia, hasta autores menos conocidos. Todos ellos abandonaron la literatura por ocio, falta de inspiraci\u00f3n, prisi\u00f3n, locura, b\u00fasquedas m\u00edsticas, ayunos interminables y mil motivos m\u00e1s. Pero tambi\u00e9n extiende Vila-Matas esta lista a personajes que siguieron la l\u00ednea de Bartleby, como lo fueron el curioso y (kafkiano tambi\u00e9n) personaje de Nathaniel Hawthorne \"Wakefield\", o el conocido Gregor Samsa. Hay despedidas de autores que renunciaron casi al final de sus vidas como Oscar Wilde, Miguel de Cervantes y su despedida escrita en su \u00faltimo libro \"Persiles\" a horas de su muerte o la \u00faltima frase del diario de Le\u00f3n Tolstoi antes de huir para morir en una estaci\u00f3n de tren. Vila-Matas nos cuenta de libros que no existieron, que nunca se escribieron, cuentos que no se terminan como las \"Narraciones incompletas \" de Felisberto Hern\u00e1ndez, de frases para el recuerdo, de personajes tristemente c\u00e9lebres y del mism\u00edsimo Herman Melville sucumbiendo al embrujo de su propio personaje para terminar aislado de todo y fracasado en la literatura mientras trabaja su aburrimiento en un triste despacho de aduana. Enrique Vila-Matas logra escribir una gran libro, de menos de doscientas p\u00e1ginas, pero repleto de abundante informaci\u00f3n de todos estos autores, libros y personajes bartlebianos, narrado de manera amena, muy entretenido, casi como si el lector fuera un amigo que lo escucha durante una tarde de inspirada charla. Su lectura me mantuvo atento puesto que soy un gran fan de todo aquello que involucre lo biogr\u00e1fico como lo hist\u00f3rico en la literatura. Mas all\u00e1 de que creo que olvid\u00f3 agregar a Harper Lee, quien luego del \u00e9xito de \"Matar a un ruise\u00f1or\", se retir\u00f3 de la literatura para no escribir m\u00e1s, le digo gracias, don Vila-Matas. M\u00e1s no puedo pedir este a\u00f1o tan, pero tan intenso. Intensidad y alegr\u00eda es algo que s\u00f3lo la literatura me puede dar. ...more Footnotes to a book that doesn't exist about writers who stopped writing (\"those in the No\") by a solitudinous Spanish hunchback.

Scritte come note a un testo fantasma, le storie di questo ricercato viandante del possibile letterario sono aneddoti fatali e umoristici, invenzioni e illuminazioni multiformi, un'enciclopedia di biografie liminari, un labirinto di scelte illogiche e irrazionali dei pi\u00f9 oscuri e segreti scrittori della contemporaneit\u00e0. Autori che hanno ospitato dentro di s\u00e9 una profonda negazione del mondo, vivendo alle prese con un male profondo e un destino feroce e inclemente, quello di sentire se stessi legittimati e realizzati solo dentro i confini di un mondo irreale, quello del racconto e della scrittura, e insieme di comprenderne interiormente la radicale e irriducibile impossibilit\u00e0. In qualche modo, l'inclinazione a essere essenzialmente sensibili all'idea della necessit\u00e0 e della fatalit\u00e0, che nella letteratura trova una tragica e dolorosa collocazione. Lo scrittore catalano ci presenta una successione di avventure dell'immaginazione, con Rulfo, Walser, Kafka, Beckett, Pessoa, gli scrittori del no e del rifiuto, Gadda e Borges, Rimbaud e Keats, ma anche Gracq e Pep\u00ecn Bello, i poeti del silenzio, della letteratura come dannazione e maledizione, della vita biologica e concreta come esilio esistenziale. Con queste figure antinomiche che come fantasmi o reperti ci tengono sotto scacco, queste voci perdute e eroiche che aspiravano all'eternit\u00e0, Vila Matas ci testimonia un'eredit\u00e0 preziosa, lascito di una partita giocata dalla letteratura tra sfida e resa a quel labirinto che \u00e8 la realt\u00e0: le loro parole di fronte all'assenza, al fallimento, all'illusione e alla follia; parole e intuizioni che hanno saputo trasformare la catastrofe in una danza, con un'anima coraggiosa e una coscienza idealista, che pensano e descrivono il mistero della letteratura, in opposizione al cinismo, all'egoismo e all'indifferenza che contraddistinguono il mondo. Una verit\u00e0 cos\u00ec oscura, che non sappiamo se sono gli scrittori ad abbandonare le parole o le parole stesse ad abbandonare loro. \"Uno scrittore che non scrive \u00e8 un mostro che incita alla follia\".

They're both collections of little tidbits about authors, although Vila-Matas' tidbits all fall under the theme of \"literature of the No\": masterpieces left unwritten, epic cases of writer's block, writerly suicides, literature that constitutes denial of the significance of literature. Bartleby and Co. mostly fails for me, though, because Vanishing Point's anecdotes tell a real story, albeit a hidden one.

Bartleby and Co. mostly fails for me, though, because Vanishing Point's anecdotes tell a real story, albeit a hidden one. You don't see the \"editor\" very often, but when you do, there's something meaningful being said about him. With Bartleby and Co., there professes to be an overarching story, that of a hunchbacked, reclusive author-of-the-No. But he's more or less static, so why should I care about him? Here's another problem: Vanishing Point 's anecdotes center around English-language literature, much of which I'm familiar with. Bartleby and Co. focuses mostly on French- and Spanish-language literature, about which I know almost nothing. Also, the authors he picks are necessarily a bit under the radar for the most part, or they're not prolific. This is huge, and it's more a failure on my part than Vila-Matas'. But I'm just callin' it like I see it. On the other hand, a few little anecdotes do partially redeem it. There's one wherein the narrator encounters Salinger on a bus, and debates whether to approach him or not. In another one, the narrator recounts an old schoolboy friendship that ends in a very unexpected way. There's a nice little one-liner cameo from Thomas Pynchon. And at one point, the narrator summarizes a book I'd really like to read, but I can't remember the name and I can't find it in the book, unfortunately, so I can't say what it is at the moment. Edit: you know what else was good? The mention of the Brautigan Library in Burlington, the home for unpublished manuscripts. This is apparently a real place, and I intend to visit it if at all possible. Ultimately, if you care about obscure French and Spanish authors, there'll be a lot of interesting stuff in here. If not...read Vanishing Point instead. ...more As usual, Mike Puma is right and Paul Bryant is wrong. The Spanish David Markson. All wrapped up in books. For lovers of anti-novels and trivia.

The \"Writers of the No\" are a wide variety ranging from those who wrote only one book, stopped inexplicably, then after a long life dies; those who wrote one or two, stopped for decades, then wrote one more again before dying (like Henry Roth); those who wrote but did not publish what they've written; those who killed themselves rather than continue writing or dreaming to write again, etc. What the heck, Vila-Matas even theorizes that anyone (you and I!) may belong to the \"Writers of the No\" at least for as long as once in his life he felt the urge to write, or had a glimpse of an idea of a book yet never got to actually writing it. \"52.

These phantom books, invisible texts, are the ones that knock at our door one day and, when we go receive them, for what is often a trivial reason, they disappear; we open the door and they are no longer there, they have gone. It was undoubtedly a great book, the great book that was inside us, the one we were really destined to write, OUR book, the very book we shall never be able to write or read now. But that book, let it be clear, exists, it is hel in suspension in the history of the art of the No. \"'Reading Cervantes recently.' writes Ribeyro in 'The Temptation of Failure,' I experienced a light sensation that unfortunately I wasn't in time to capture (why? someone interrupted me, the phone rang, I don't know), but I remember I felt driven to start something....Then everything faded. We all have a book, possibly a great book, but in the tumult of our inner lives it rarely emerges or is so fleeting that we don't have time to pin it down.\" Inside your head right now, unwritten, and perhaps will never be written, is another masterpiece of world literature.

Sono quegli esseri che ospitano dentro di s\u00e9 una profonda negazione del mondo. Prendono il nome dallo scrivano Bartleby, l'impiegato di un racconto di Herman Melville che non \u00e8 stato mai visto leggere nemmeno un giornale e che, per lunghi intervalli di tempo, se ne resta in piedi a guardare fuori dalla pallida finestra che c'\u00e8 dietro un paravento, rivolto verso un muro di mattoni di Wall Street. Bartleby non beve mai birra, t\u00e8 o caff\u00e8 come gli altri; non \u00e8 mai andato da nessuna parte, giacch\u00e9 abita nell'ufficio, dove trascorre persino le domeniche; non ha mai detto chi \u00e8, n\u00e9 da dove viene, n\u00e9 se ha dei familiari a questo mondo; quando gli si domanda dove \u00e8 nato o gli si affida un lavoro o gli si chiede che racconti qualcosa di s\u00e9, risponde invariabilmente: \"Preferirei non farlo\". Ecco chi sono i \u201cbartleby\u201d. Sono persone che, a un certo punto della loro vita, dicono \u201cno\u201d, per scelta o per un qualche tipo di necessit\u00e0/fatalit\u00e0. L\u2019estensore stesso delle note lo \u00e8. Un \u201cbartleby\u201d, intendo. E, incredibilmente, da questo insieme di annotazioni eterogenee nasce uno scritto appassionante, coinvolgente e interessante come pochi. Una narrazione che va avanti e indietro nel tempo, ritorna a volte su temi e personaggi gi\u00e0 citati o si perde in rivoli inaspettati e sorprendenti prima di tornare pi\u00f9 o meno in carreggiata. Si parla soprattutto di scrittori, ma non solo. C\u2019\u00e8 spazio anche per qualche altro tipo di artista. Ed \u00e8 quasi tutto vero quel ci viene raccontato, ma non proprio sempre. Eh s\u00ec, perch\u00e9 Vila-Matas, ogni tanto, ci infila un ritrattino delizioso, ma maliziosamente e perfidamente falso. Solo che, a meno di non avere una cultura enciclopedica come la sua, il lettore non \u00e8 mai del tutto sicuro di non essere stato preso per i fondelli, a meno di non \u201cgoogolare\u201d alla grande.

Se molti scrittori hanno inventato \"zii Celerini\" di ogni genere per riflettere sui propri silenzi, il caso di Carlo Emilio Gadda non potrebbe essere pi\u00f9 opposto al loro, giacch\u00e9 dedic\u00f2 tutta la vita a praticare, con notevole entusiasmo, quella che Italo Calvino defin\u00ec \"arte della molteplicit\u00e0\", cio\u00e8 l'arte di scrivere una narrazione interminabile, quel racconto infinito che molto tempo prima aveva scoperto Laurence Sterne nel suo Tristram Shandy, dove ci dice che in una narrazione lo scrittore non pu\u00f2 condurre la sua storia come il mulattiere conduce il mulo - in linea retta e sempre in avanti -, poich\u00e9 se \u00e8 dotato di un minimo di intelligenza si trover\u00e0 obbligato, lungo il suo cammino, a deviare cinquanta volte dalla linea retta per unirsi a questo o a quel gruppo, e non lo potr\u00e0 evitare in nessun modo: \u201cGli si presenteranno viste e prospettive che reclameranno continuamente la sua attenzione; e gli sar\u00e0 tanto impossibile non fermarsi a guardarle quanto volare\u201d. Vabb\u00e8, mi cospargo il capo di cenere e parto seduta stante per Canossa. Ma sono contenta lo stesso, perch\u00e9 valeva pena essere definita \u201ccretina\u201d pur di avere il piacere di leggere questo libro. :-) Per\u00f2, adesso che ci penso, forse anche Anna Karenina stessa \u00e8 una \u201cbartleby\u201d.

I've read it twice and still can barely remember it. Is its own non-entityism intentional? I don't think so, but it's a great intro to some fascinating writers, some of which I had never heard of before. It's a book whose modest place is to lead its readers to other books.

As a result of a personal trauma and the reaction of his surrounding to the publication of the book, he has become silent as an author, a modern Bartleby that spends most of his uneventful life in an office. A misheard remark of a colleague (\"Mr. Bartleby is in a meeting\".) triggers in him again an urge to write - a novel in the form of footnotes on the representatives of what he calls \"the Literature of the No\", a collection of aphorisms, short musings and essays, glimpses of personal memories, quotations from phone conversations with a friend or from letters of a writer, and recollections of meetings with other authors. The 86 footnotes that form the biggest part of the text circle around those authors who at a certain moment in their lives \"preferred not to\" write any longer, and whom the narrator considers as brothers (although also a female author plays an important role, the \"Bartleby syndrome\" seems to be by far more widespread among male writers.). The dull and uneventful life of the narrator, together with his tendency to bath sometimes in self-pity are frequently contrasted by remarks that made me smile. A good example which is typical for the \"sound\" of the book are the opening lines: \"I never had much luck with women. I have a pitiful hump, which I am resigned to. All my closest relatives are dead. I am a poor recluse working in a ghastly office. Apart from that, I am happy.\" The modern \"Literature of the No\" dates back to the 19th century when the two American writers (and friends) Melville and Hawthorne created their stories Bartleby the Scrivener and Wakefield, two stories about a rejection that in many ways foreshadowed \"future phantom books and other refusals to write that would soon flood the literary stage.\" In his footnotes, the narrator explores famous examples of the \"Literature of the No\", such as Robert Walser or Kafka; and while suicide or mental insanity seem to be among the most popular \"strategies\" for the Bartlebys among the authors, they are not held in particular high esteem by the narrator. He is definitely more interested in those cases where an author, while still alive simply disappeared from literature. One of the most interesting things about the book is the abundance of examples of authors that are introduced to us readers; while I read many of them and know a few others by name, I discovered also plenty of seemingly extremely interesting writers particularly from the Spanish-speaking literature (mea culpa that I am not so well read in Spanish literature as I should considering the richness of this literary continent) who have fell silent at a certain moment in their lives. Felisberto Hernandez for example was not an author I had on my radar until now, but I will definitely look up what I can find about him. Another interesting author \"without a work\" is the Italian (non-)author Bobi Bazlen, whose name I came across once in Claudio Magris' books about Trieste. I can imagine that one of the most annoying questions for an author must be the following: \"What are you writing right now? On what are you working?\"; or to an author who hasn't published anything since a long time: \"Why don't you write again? What is the reason for your silence?\" One of the best answers for me to the latter question is that of Juan Rulfo, an author for whose slender work I have the highest admiration: \"Well, my Uncle Celerino died and it was he who told me the stories.\" Not that this Uncle Celerino was an invention, he had really existed and was known as a big storyteller - but there must have been something else behind the silence of Rulfo, something about which he rather preferred not to speak. Our narrator gives us also some examples of his own experience and research that includes a chance meeting with J.D. Salinger in New York, a visit at Julien Gracq's home, but also personal memories about his childhood friendship with Luis Felipe Pineda, or his infatuation with Maria Lima Mendes, a very impressive example of a female representative of the \"Literature of the No\" (and possibly made up by Vila-Matas). H\u00f6lderlin, Chamfort, Rimbaud, Larbaud, Hofmannsthal, Fernando Pessoa, Juan Ramon Jimenez, and many others make an appearance in these footnotes. And although as a reader we will not resolve in a single case the true reason for the silence of an author, we will have experienced an abundance of witty, comical, tragic, interesting anecdotes, stories, musings when we have finished this - obviously well-translated - book. The narrator of this book (and its author) deserve a place at the Olympus of writers and non-writers of books. Who is able to write wonderful ironic passages like this one: \"I've worked well, I can be pleased with what I've done. I put down my pen, because it's evening. Twilight imaginings. My wife and kids are in the next room, full of life. I have good health and enough money. God, I'm unhappy! But what am I saying? I'm not unhappy, I haven't put down the pen, I don't have a wife and kids, or a next room, I don't have enough money, it isn't evening.\" and who is granting his happy-unhappy and rather unreliable narrator the equally ironic luck to complete this wonderful book about authors who fell silent, must be a great author himself. My first book my Vila-Matas, and for sure not my last. P.S. And what about those who wrote, but were rejected by too many publishers, and who therefore gave up on being published? Also here, our narrator is helpful. Send your rejected manuscript to the Brautigan Library, the brainchild of underground author Richard Brautigan, nowadays hosted at the Washington State University Vancouver. \"The Brautigan Library accepts exclusively manuscripts that, having been rejected by the publishers who were sent them, were never published. This library holds only aborted books. Anyone with such a manuscript, wishing to submit it to the Brautigan Library or Library of the No, need only pop it in the post ... I have it on good authority - though there they are only interested in bad authority - that no manuscript is ever rejected; on the contrary, there they are looked after and exhibited with the greatest pleasure and respect.\" ...more Enrique Vila-Matas came to me via Roberto Bola\u00f1o's book Between Parentheses: Essays, Articles, and Speeches, 1998-2003 where Bola\u00f1o championed the work of Vila-Matas. I immediately ordered the Vila-Matas Bartleby & Company novel that was nothing less than charming and gave me options aplenty for new and interesting Spanish-speaking writers to discover as well as an education regarding the preference of certain writers to decide not to do anything rather than write or publish their work. Fascinating catalog of authors who preferred not to write organized in the style of a freewheeling novel. An extra star for its invaluable reading recommendations.

Though promoted as a \"novel,\" I increasingly found passages of narrator describing his own life perfunctory, even distracting and annoying, as if author was reminding himself every now and then that he should remind us there was some fictional persona making these observations. The book is better read as a collection of essays, and though \"chapters\" (footnotes, actually) are numbered, I didn't discover any compelling reason to read them in order, primarily because they started getting pretty repetitive about half way through. The book never went anywhere, just circled around the same motif of \"no.\" Not that I was expecting any clear argument or \"point\" or judgement, but some sense of deepening insight that never arrived. And that was a shame, because the book started out with great promise, and I found individual \"notes\" fascinating, but then it gradually got monotonous. No surprises. I got so bored after a while that I didn't even finish it -- so maybe there is some larger insight I missed at the end, but I gather from reading other reviews here that was not the case. I would recommend jumping around and reading individual pieces as they grab you. Although EV-M does reference some previously mentioned works throughout, I think the only piece required for appreciating his project would be Melville's short story \"Bartleby the Scrivener,\" one of the greatest stories ever penned. ...more<---C>Enrique Vila-Matas</---C>", "Title": "Bartleby & Co."},
