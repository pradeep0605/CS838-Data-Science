I love the characters, and particularly Adelia. I love the pacing, the mysteries, the historical setting. I love Henry II, even though he drives me batty sometimes. What I really don't love is Rowley. In previous books, I sort of managed to put up with him - he manages to be less annoying as the plot thickens, and he generally isn't around much before then. The reason I dislike Rowley is this: he doesn't love Adelia. Not really. He hates all the parts of her that she cherishes. He hates that she is a doctor. He hates that she is educated. He hates that she is driven to seek out truth. He wants her to be a typical fainting lady. He expected her to give up her whole life to marry him and while away her life in his manor somewhere, sheltered and bored. And he will never forgive her for saying no. Why does he think he loves her? He hates everything that makes her who she is. And even worse, why does Adelia - wonderful, brilliant, just warrior that she is - think she loves him? She deserves better. Because in the end, that's what it boils down to for me: Rowley doesn't deserve her. Not by a mile. I'd frankly rather see her with Henry. At least Henry appreciates her. Realizes how incredible she is, what a gift she has. Recognizes that it can't be, SHOULDN'T be, cast away. Of course, Henry II and Adelia will never end up together - that would cross too many lines in historical fiction, something that Franklin works hard not to do in this series. But regardless, Henry would be better for her than Rowley, stupid Rowley who can't appreciate her, and just wants to make her something that she isn't. And this book made me angry, in the end, because Adelia changed her mind and agreed to try to be something she isn't, for HIM. Stupid, condescending, ignorant, pompous Rowley. I hope it doesn't ruin the series for me. *sigh* ...more First Sentence: \u201cAnd God was angry with His people of Somerset so that, in the year of Our Lord 1154. pm the day after the feast of Saint Stephen, He caused an earthquake that it might punish them for their sins\u2026\u201d Thus wrote Brother Caradoc in Saint Michael\u2019s chapel in top of Glastonbury Tor, to which he\u2019d scrambled, gasping and sobbing, so as to escape the devastation that God with his earthquake had wrought on everything below it.

Franklin is an author from whom I know I shall get a wonderful story. This book was no exception. With historical mysteries, I always start by reading the Author\u2019s Notes. I like knowing what is historically accurate and what liberties have been taken. In this case; there were not many. The depth of research is evident and educational. Herbs, weapons, law, forensic science, and medicine during this period are masterfully woven into the story. Franklin\u2019s writing is so visual; it is as if watching a film. The descriptions are rich and, even when the scenes are unpleasant, so well done. I liked the use of lucid dreams, the inclusion of Excalibur and a very nasty version of Robin Hood and his men. The characters are wonderful. Adelia is smart, strong and caring. Although focused on her task at hand, she is even more concerned about her friend, Emma, who, along with her son and staff, has disappeared. All the characters are three dimensional and believable, although I shall always hear Henry II as having Peter O\u2019Toole\u2019s voice. The dialogue is often funny providing laughter amidst the drama, as is true in life. Is this a perfect book? No, as there are a few too many coincidences. Is it a great read?

Set in Glastonbury and wrapped in the mists of Avalon, the work is a must for anyone besotted with the Matter of Britain. Adelia, the mistress of the art of death (a kind of medieval forensic pathologist trained at Salerno), is a worthy successor to the Brother Cadfael of Ellis Peters, who pursued his forensic investigations earlier in the 12th century during the wars of King Stephen and the Empress Maud. Adelia works in the time of Henry II and at his command. Like Elizabeth Peters in her Amelia Peabody series (at least in the earlier and better of those), Ariana Franklin is not afraid of humor. Suspense, humor, romance, and interesting historical interpretations -- not a bad combination. I eagerly await Relics of the Dead , the next of Adelia's adventures. Can a PBS miniseries be far behind? ...more <+++>Grave Goods</+++> 3.5 Stars The historical background is fascinating despite one or two glaring inconsistencies (that are ultimately explained in the author's note), but the investigation into the corpses believed to be those of Arthur and Guinevere is not as engrossing as in the previous books.

There are a number of mysteries interspersed throughout the book: Who are the unidentified corpses in the Glastonbury graveyard? Who set fire to the abbey? What happened to Adelia's friend Emma and her child? Everything is ultimately resolved but it is all very anti-climactic. There is also very little character development in this one. Adelia and Rowley come to terms with their on again, off again romance but other than that the characters are extremely one dimensional, although Henry II does have his moments. All in all, not a bad mystery and the book is worth reading for the history and for the insight into Arthurian legend. ...more This book horrified and offended me.

In all honesty and fairness, you should know I'm writing this while waiting for lasagna to finish heating. Hunger may make me a more biting reviewer than usual. There's lots of good in Ariana Franklin's writing. I so enjoyed \"The Siege Winter\" due to her vivid descriptions of medieval life, specifically of the castle siege, and the endearing cast of characters she created. That book suffered from the same faults as \"Grave Goods,\" but I felt like I was being hit over the head with the problems in this book. The problems? My old history prof called it \"presentism,\" which is the fault of looking at history only through modern eyes. It killed this book. The characters are wooden--really, they are more stereotypes than characters. The main protagonist, Ms. Aguilar, is truly a modern woman somehow, inexplicably in a medieval setting. She doesn't have much personality (and isn't all that charming either), except for feeling indignant at all the things a modern person might find reprehensible about the Middle Ages. She doesn't seem to believe that religion is anything other than a salve for emotionally weak people, or a tool for power-hungry despots. In short, she thinks like a modern secular feminist, and it's not believable given the setting. It's one thing to write a forward-thinking character; it's altogether another to build an entire \"personality\" based on personal indignation at everyone around her and portray her as a thoroughly modern woman. This is highlighted by the side-characters: The Catholic priests are either naive or sinister, and the Catholic church is merely a overbearing social construct, rather than, you know, a religion. Mansur, a Muslim, is described in a way that hearkens back to British colonial descriptions of the \"exotic.\" His religion is respected (unlike the Catholics') as mystical, but largely not based in reality. He's vaguely wise and guru-like, but without any dimension or complexity. One big plot point that felt like a caricature of the Middle Ages (tiny spoiler): Ms. Aguilar, in a previous book, decides not to marry the guy she loves because she believes marriage will interfere with her work. It's all very feminist and high-minded, right? Except that the man who wants to marry her is a noble, and historically, the responsibility of the \"woman of the manor\" was to learn medicine. They were expected to be trained (as well as they could in that day) on herbs and remedies. Ms. Aguilar is a doctor, so marriage to a noble lord would not have been the death-knell of her work; it would have likely given her a greater opportunity to do it. I so wanted to enjoy this book. But it felt more like an exhausting parade through stereotypes than a good story with strong characters. ...more An enjoyable medieval mystery, the third in this series.

Her character is strong but vulnerable and even throws up a heartfelt prayer here and there. She does not discount religion despite a few bad experiences. She has regrets, she learns to cope with new situations, she lets herself love, and fights tooth and nail for what she believes in. Much of the action is unexpected and gripping. There were multiple parts to the plot that, happily, I did not pick up from the back cover description. I love surprises like this, and the plots just kept twisting and turning. I did guess the Arturus plot thread right away, but the rest of the revelations were surprises. The dialogue and settings were so strong that I really felt history come alive as I read. While at times it was hard to decipher what the less-educated characters were saying, it felt so authentic and fit right in with what I was reading (even though the author did modernize the language for us modern readers), so it really did not distract me from the overall plot development. There is so much detail to the characters as well as the social setting. From the classes (from tithings to lords and ladies), rituals about life and death, living qualities, court proceedings and laws, weaponry, medicines, etc., all this was amazingly ripe with historical fact. I loved how immersed I was in 12th century England time and place as well as the action. The only thing that threw me out of the setting was the use of the word \u201cforensics.\u201d It just feels too modern a term, but I cannot say when the word itself started being used. As the rest of the story was so richly authentic, I will trust Franklin\u2019s call in including it. Franklin adds a little bit of everything: Suspense, romance, historical facts, and humor! Franklin knows how to stir up the pot on previous historical confines yet create something sensational. Some authors tend to dehumanize historical characters by making them about as warm as a tomb wall painting. Franklin knows how to take a character and look beyond the exterior wall. She understands that throughout history, people have always joked, laughed, and cursed at their circumstances. Many books of this time period are very hard on the church of the time. While this book does show some less than desirable qualities to the medieval times church goings, most of the characters are caring, forgiving, and understanding that people make mistakes and that God is not as harsh as some rulers would make you believe. I appreciated that the author did not grate heavily against the religious practices and beliefs. The church does have its black spots, but this book offered something fresh by highlighting more redeeming characters. I was very impressed with this book. I will be looking for other books of this series to dive into. Such historical depth and quality of character make this a very satisfying read. ...more 4 Stars Book Blurb England, 1176.

We have Adelia dealing with those mysterious bones, to the mystery of her friend, Emma\u2019s disappearance; and how in the heck Glastonbury Abbey is burned to the ground. This novel is filled with scheming villains, prejudice, unwarranted hatred, distorted loyalties, buried secrets and only a tadbit of feisty Glytha (I like her!).

Henry wants to take advantage of a recent discovery at Glastonbury, site of the ancient Avalon, final resting place of Arthur according to legend. Two skeletons have been unearthed there; are they or are they not those of Arthur and his queen, Guinevere? Either way, Henry plans on taking advantage of the information; what he needs from Adelia, his clandestine forensic pathologist, is certainty, one way or the other. Adelia protests with the usual result. Adelia, Mansour, Allie and Gyltha set off for Glastonbury armed with Henry s protection and, for once, some of that miser s money.[return][return]That s the start of an exciting pulse-pounding page-turning thriller that is the best yet in this series, surpassing Mistress of the Art of Death which is outstanding. Franklin has really outdone herself in plotting, with twists at every turn. She is adept at putting Adelia in credible life-threatening situations; this one is superb, so scary that I had to put the book down for a few minutes in order to break the tension. Franklin s writing is outstanding. In her Author s Note, she says she deliberately uses modern English because the characters would have sounded contemporaneous to one another--she acheives the same effect with modern, fairly formal English. The only exception is Gyltha, to whom she gives a Fenland accent. It all works perfectly.[return][return]Franklin even throws in sly humor, as in the passage where Adelia rails against ever arriving in England and discovering emotion, which she considers treacherous; the English, she says, bitterly, are too overwrought with emotion and she, Adelia, had been better off in rational, unemotional Sicily! Franklin, of course, is British, and her gentle dig brought to mind the Aubrey/Maturin books set during the Napoleonic Wars in which Stephen Maturin, an Irishman, notes disapprovingly time and again that the English are so prone to emotionalism, crying even forsooth![return][return]The denouement is excellent, although part of it I suspected early on, but it doesn t matter--the way Franklin arrives at her resolution is truly outstanding.[return][return]But unusually for Franklin, who surely knows how to write, the story carries on for a while, seeming to violate that edict that, after the climax, a writer should wrap up quickly. [return][return]Oh, don t worry. There s a reason.[return][return]Absolutely a must read for those who love to mix historical fiction with medieval mystery. I can not recommend this book highly enough. ...more Despite Dr. Vesuvia Adelia Rachel Ortese Aguilar's more annoying traits of having a very short fuse and seldom seeing the forest for the trees, she makes for a fascinating and unique heroine.

It's not as if the characters here say \"back in the day\" and \"epic fail\" and whatnot in Franklin's contemporary British English. Her language and history feel right for a literary mystery novel. The character of Henry II as lawgiver and modernizer is particularly compelling. This story takes Adelia and friends to Glastonbury to verify recently discovered bones thought to be those of Arthur and Guinevere. The king has been fighting the rebellious Welsh, who have a special \"historical\" claim to the legendary Arthur, and he would like nothing better than to prove by medical science that Arthur is dead. Not, you know, lying in a state of suspended animation in a crystal cave or something in Avalon, the once and future king who will return to England in its time of greatest need. ...more Forced into flight from her beloved fens, Arelia, the forensic physician, is ordered by Henry II to discover if remains recently uncovered at Glastonbury are those of Arthur and Guenevere.

She and her Saracen manservant Mansur, who masquerades as the true doctor since the time and place forbid a woman to practice, discover that the fire is being blamed on an innocent man, that a vicious robber is plying the woods around the holy town, that someone does not want them to work out the identity of the skeletons (the female of which has been mutilated between waist and thigh), and that there is another mystery in a cave in the forest. Time after time Arelia finds herself and her friends in danger of their lives from terrified men, the mad, and those who want their secrets drowned by the advancing sea. I love these books; I love this character. Her struggles against the constrictions placed on her as an educated woman and on her concealing Saracen manservant, Mansur, are all too believable, making me want to smack her sometimes-lover, Bishop Rowley, and Henry II. Franklin's portrayal of Henry II is pretty wonderful, too. ...more Wow.

As for the world she created - it matches my idea of this era almost perfectly. The characters had a strange way of seeping under my skin at times that I haven't found in a while - usually I don't get emotionally involved with my books unless it is to think the lead male should exist as he would be ridiculously hot (ha). I never thought I'd like historical novels but the Arthurian legend aspect intreguied and convinced me. Oh, and may I congratulate the makers of this beautiful cover. It is rare these days to find something like this. Sometimes the characters were annoying and some of the hints about what happened in previous books have placed doubt in my mind about whether they'll live up to expectations, which is why this has 4 instead of 5 stars, but all in all I enjoyed this book and would recommend it. ...more This book, third in the series of historical mysteries about a woman physician/forensic pathologist in Henry II's England (yes! really!), was a perfectly fine entry in the series but just didn't blow me away.

Glastonbury Abbey has burned down and the monks claim to have found a coffin which may contain the remains of Arthur and Guinevere. Since the Celts cling to a belief that Arthur is only sleeping and will return to save them, Henry thinks proof of their deaths would be a Good Thing. Adelia (the physician) is sent to Glastonbury in hopes she can \"prove\" the death. There are a number of subplots as well. I enjoyed the discussions of medieval medicine and herbalism and the ingenious way Adelia treats a torn Achilles tendon. Her relationship with the Bishop of St. Albans grows ever more complicated. The book seemed to drag a bit at the end. I'll probably read more of the series, but I may not be quite as eager as before. ...more This was a great little mystery/historical fiction.

Throw in some murders, feudal laws, Plantagenet progression, a Welsh bard, some innocent and some not-so-innocent men of the cloth... it was great. I thought some of the language was far too modern, but in reading the author's note at the end I understand why she wrote this way and I can forgive her of it. It actually added to the charm, honestly. And while many of the events in the novel (such as the huge earthquake, finding Excalibur, and the supposed Arthur and Guinevere skeletons) are real events, I liked that the author freely admits to changing around some of the timing issues to better fit her novel. It seems like it should all be fiction, but so much of it is not. That's what makes good historical fiction. I think I need to find the first two books of this series and then continue on. ...more Again, really enjoyed this book, it's one of my fave historical series!

I loved the sense of unease and threat that encompassed this book, you knew bad stuff was gonna go down, but didn't know from where. I thought the plotting was really well done. I have one complaint though (that bleeds into my utter dislike of the next book in the series). SPOILER: I like mystery series because they are somewhat stand alone. I can pick one up 6 months after reading the previous and not be lost. To introduce a character that bleeds over into the next book in a big way was super annoying to me, partially because he was set up as a bad guy loose-end that needed to be dealt with through the last 1/3rd of the book. I kept waiting and I can't tell you how annoyed I was to see the dude in the last page being ominous. UUUUGH. Well whatever, still a great book, highly recommended. ...more I truly enjoy the characters in this series and while the first couple were so interesting as I progressed I found myself classifying succeeding volumes as cozy medieval mysteries.

I quite enjoy the conversations with the king even though as one of my gr friends pointed out highly unlikely. The plot of this one finds Adelia ordered to identify the bones of two skeletons found in a coffin in the graveyard at Glastonbury. The locals claim they are the bones of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere and King Henry hopes they are because the rebellious groups he is dealing with are sure King Arthur will ride again and lead them to victory. But Adelia finds more tasks when she is kidnapped by a local group of men, one of whose members is accused of setting fire to Glastonbury. Adding to her woes is the disappearance of her friend, Lady Emma, her son and her knight champion. Can she complete all these tasks? ...more Relics of the Dead: Mistress of the Art of Death 3 is a story about King Arthur, Glastonbury and the west country.

Could they be the remains of King Arthur and Guinevere? King Henry II summons his Wise Woman (but she has to be careful as heresy and witchcraft are everywhere)\u00a0to examine the remains and give her assessment. She has to overcome those who want the remains to stay unidentified; there are many who believe that Arthur still lives and will return to lead the Welsh once again to challenge Henry\u2019s rule. The descriptive writing is excellent and those who like these historical novels, loosely based on legends and history, will really love it. It also has a very modern twist where the Wise Woman has to make her judgements through a male intermediary as women were not taken seriously. Also, another interesting theme is how the legal system actively changes during the progress of the novel as Henry tries to modernise ways of judgement. ...more Grave Goods by Arianna Franklin- It was EXCELLENT!

She\u2019s supposed to verify that the skeletons are indeed Arthur and Guinevere so the Welsh will stop fighting. Turns out that the skeleton\u2019s aren\u2019t but through a series of obstacles and plot twists the Doctor figures out what really happened. The book moved quickly, the plot twists were nice (even though a little predictable). The only issue I had with this book was the fact that it kept climaxing, and after the first two climaxes, it started getting anti-climatic. Overall though it was a fun read, I mean c\u2019mon, how can you not like King Arthur, The Plantagenet\u2019s and forensics all in one book? ...more I do so very much enjoy this series. The stories are well-written; I like the main characters and the plot is always interesting and a page - turner. I enjoy a historical mystery and also like mysteries set in the UK for some reason.

This story revolves around Henry II's task to Adelia to ascertain if the bones discovered after the fire at the Abbey at Glastonbury are those of Alfred and Guinnevere. Adelia and her friends journey to Glastonbury to follow Henry's orders. Along the way, of course, other mysteries also intrude on the initial mission. The people that Adelia meets during this adventure/ mystery are interesting and make the story that much better. I especially liked the Tithing (I think I've got that right), poor men, forced into petty theft, but with honour and morals. I won't write more as I don't want to ruin the story for others, but Grave Goods lives up to the first two books in the Mistress of Death series and kept me interested throughout. Highly recommended. ...more Really 1.5 stars, but not worth rounding up. I listened to the WHOLE THING in my car on audiobook. Why did I listen to the whole thing? Good question.

There was not one character that I cared about and I even cheered the couple of times that the main character was in danger. I was hoping for her demise so that the book would end!

Henry II was the greatest king of his time, unfortunately just way ahead of his time in some aspects, especially where the church was concerned and their almost malignant presence is felt throughout the book. ...more I was just looking for an audiobook to tide me over a trip, and I ran across this one.

Kate Reading does a great job with the voices, especially the Welsh and country folk accents. Not my favorite of the three. I guessed some major plot points early on but it was still good. I did enjoy the whole King Arthur's grave aspect as one of my favorite books from childhood was about that find (Hidden Treasure of Glaston by Eleanor Jewett). The ending sets us up for a truly threatening turn of events in the next book. Can't wait. I love medievals, so was delighted when my book club chose this, but it's not my kind of book. I did finish it, though, because the writing was good. It seemed contrived and I had trouble suspending disbelief, but I'm convinced it's just the genre I don't enjoy. Characters were well-developed, though, and I loved the setting. I found the heroine's casual relationship with K Henry a bit of a stretch. Incredible. Maybe the best of the three so far. I adore Adelia, and I love the way Ariana Franklin writes - her books are funny, informative, and articulate. And her Henry II makes me proud to be English (even though he wasn't) in a way that recent history doesn't. I read this in one sitting - I can't wait for the next Adelia book. Just watch half a season of any forensics-heavy procedural with a sassy female scientist lead dealing with heaps of modern problems while maintaining her professional integrity. Then set it in 12th century England. Done. The plot was intriguing enough to drag me across the finish line, but the line could have been 50 pages earlier.
