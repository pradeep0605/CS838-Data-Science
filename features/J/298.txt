I really wanted a psychological thriller that would keep me guessing. And did it deliver? Well, let's just say I was up until 2am, partly because this book is unputdownable, and partly because it's a little hard to turn the light off and go to sleep afterwards. <+++>Before I Go to Sleep</+++> is about a woman called Christine who wakes up every morning with no memory of who she is. Through labeled pictures and the help of her husband, every day she pieces together her life and learns of the accident that made her this way. But then a visit from a mysterious doctor leads her towards the private journal she has been writing to herself - a journal that tells her things might not be as they seem and the one person she should be able to trust could be lying. Personally, I found this book so thrilling .<---F> I loved almost everything about it</---F>. Christine was a complex and interesting character - I was pulled so far inside her mind that the novel's events literally made my heart pound. I love how creepy the novel is and I very much enjoyed almost but not quite figuring out the reveals at the end. For me, the best kind of thrillers are those where the story is strong enough that it isn't ruined by an astute reader. In other words - if you guess what is going to happen, it doesn't really matter. And I think this is one of those books. Towards the end, I started to figure things out, but rather than being disappointed, it made me hang on the author's every word in anticipation and horror. Also, the reveals are multi-layered. So there is not just one big twist/reveal, but many things to discover over the course of the book. I like this much more. The biggest complaints from people who didn't like this book are a) it is as realistic as The Time Traveler's Wife and b) it gets a little repetitive around the middle. Both are true, but neither bothered me. I'll tell you why. The book gets a little repetitive when Christine must first read her journal every day to understand everything. The book obviously doesn't go into details each time, but I can understand why people didn't like it. I, on the other hand, didn't mind. In fact, I thought it dragged out the suspense even more and had me mentally freaking out over what would come next. I was never bored for a second . As for being realistic, the author manufactures a fictional type of amnesia in order for the story to work - an amnesia in which Christine remembers almost nothing of her short term memory, but is able to retain her short term memory for the length of her waking hours. It is reset overnight. But, to be honest, I absolutely love reading about weird rare illnesses, particularly psychological ones. And there are so many strange, unbelievable illnesses out there that it wasn't difficult for me to suspend disbelief and imagine that a rare amnesia of this sort could exist. If you think, like me, you could overlook the issues above, I don't see why you wouldn't like this. Very different, very unsettling, and very enjoyable.

It barely has to earn anything; it just has to hold on to what it started with. But wow, this book fell off a cliff or something! What the hell happened?? First let\u2019s back the truck out of these plot holes and start from the beginning. The premise of this psychological thriller is fairly straightforward. The first person narrator has amnesia. More specifically, she has a mythical combination of several different forms of amnesia which happen to co-exist simultaneously at the exact same time . Maybe that should have been my first clue. She has retrograde amnesia as a result of a mysterious traumatic episode that occurred years earlier, and on top of this she has anterograde amnesia which affects her episodic memory: she cannot retain anything new. My second clue that this book would be an eye roller is that she has a short-term memory capacity of many hours\u2014essentially an entire day\u2019s worth\u2014and it is erased only when she falls asleep, which flagrantly stretches the definition of anterograde amnesia by a large margin.\u00b9 So this unreliable narrator with her unreliable memory is trying to piece together the details of her life while basically having to start from scratch every day. I love the idea of this. I love the idea that without memory retention, one cannot build experiences and without experiences, he cannot forge interpersonal bonds with others, which means he cannot develop relationships or attain any kind of emotional maturity or love. He cannot even experience the feeling of anticipation because it would require a preexisting sense of future combined with a knowledge of the past, both of which are conspicuously absent when you have to be reminded every morning that you have amnesia to begin with. There is no future, there is no past, there is no anticipation of anything. It is only the here and now. Because of my interest in this I was able to suspend my beliefs a bit regarding the nuances of the narrator\u2019s form of amnesia. Still, Watson manages to muck it all up. The narrator\u2019s sense of mistrust, confusion, and paranoia are there, but the frustration of her existence is glossed over at each subsequent sunrise for the sake of plot progression. And the ending, OH GOD THE ENDING. It devolves so quickly to predictable Sleeping with the Enemy \u2013style fare that all enthusiasm for the psychological part of the story is lost. Truly, I think this could have been a decent novel, I really do. Watson\u2019s clich\u00e9d structure, though, leaves too much to be desired and the book simply does not live up to its potential. \u00b9After writing this review, I came across a blog post by the author who sort of corroborates my assertion that the narrator\u2019s form of anterograde amnesia is somewhat of a fabrication.

I need to write this in my oh so important journal otherwise I will run through the same routine again and not recollect her or the egg. Oh yes that book before I forget this book has inspired me to write more into this journal as the female protagonist is in same situation as me. Her story is ever so more gripping, its tense I am almost glued to the pages her quest is heart warming and heartbreaking I felt tears of joy and sadness on the completion of her story. The story is in the first-person narrative and flows in a visceral fashion. They say it can be cured what we have if we piece together our past and write, I hope so. The story was something fresh and different well worth the read. When I wake up tomorrow I must remember on reading this journal that I have to share these thoughts and write a review.

The concept, while not strictly novel (I can recall maybe half a dozen stories where amnesia like this features prominently) is utilized to great effect. The mystery is initially built quite satisfactorily, and you're drawn in as a reader. Fairly soon, however, the concept frays a bit and you have to suspend a little bit of disbelief to get through the book. There were holes that I saw - not insurmountable ones, but still distracting. I saw the ending (I won't ruin it) coming from a mile away, only because you know with a book like this it *needs* a twist of some sort, and there was only one particular twist that made sense. Even so, the ending was a let down, because what should have been something emotionally laden was handled like an afterthought. With a bit of editing and some revision, this could have been a much more engaging book. The first half works really well, and then it sort of deflates for me. Too bad it didn't finish as strong. ...more Omg! I am totally speechless. This book was amazing. It had a great plot about a woman who has amnesia and cannot remember her memories from day to day.

So, the book and I were off to a good start when, on the page one, Christine wakes up confused in a strange room. Unfortunately for her, it is not as simple as seeing the room in reverse. Every day she has to reacquaint herself with her husband, her house, the person in the mirror. Christine has a form of amnesia wherein, after an accident, she lost the ability retain memories past a day. As Christine starts keeping a journal to help her remember, she discovers some unsettling discrepancies between what her husband tells her, what her doctor knows of her history, and her own reemerging memories. I bought this book at a favorite indie bookstore, Murder by the Book, where the staff is super knowledgeable and enthusiastic. No matter what book I carry to the cashier, two or three people behind the counter will share their favorite aspect of the book and start rattling off other books in the genre that I have to read. You don\u2019t even have to ask them. They just start talking. When I bought this one to the check-out, there was a dead silence. \u201cWhat? Does it suck?\u201d They started grinning. \u201cIs it so bad it\u2019s good?\u201d Crickets. \u201cTalk to me!\u201d Finally, someone took pity on me. He explained the ending is so amazing and unexpected that they all agreed to keep their mouths shut and not spoil it for anyone. What a jerk. If you read the book expecting a mind-blowing ending, you might be disappointed. The whole time I was reading, my mind was running on all cylinders trying to solve the mystery. I was coming up with crazy ideas \u2013 I mean really outlandish ideas. The aliens wiped her memory after she stumbled on a plot to steal all the antelopes in Uganda. Then they disguised one of their own as her husband to spy on her next door neighbor! Stop looking at me like that. The guy at the store said it would be totally unexpected. When I finally got to the end, I was let down by how simultaneously unrealistic and ordinary it was. Honestly, it reminded me of another book, (view spoiler) [ The Guardian (hide spoiler) ] . My recommendation: read with more tempered expectations for the conclusion. Even if it was not the best ending of my life, it wasn\u2019t horrible either. I just ruined it for myself with the hype. Having written all that, I enjoyed this book! I suggest you focus Christine\u2019s journey throughout the book. I was in sync with her as she vacillates between trust and suspicion toward every character \u2013 including herself. Plus my husband was out of town. Even if a book is only remotely creepy, there is something about reading it in an empty house that makes it seem like the scariest thing ever (see The Little Stranger ). I also didn\u2019t have any plans that weekend, which meant I could read this book in two long sessions and get wrapped up in everything. If I had read the book without those two conditions, the rating may have dropped to three stars. You know what is coming next: my report from an event with the author! Right off the bat, Watson admitted he had not done many of these events. He advised us that if we heard a tremor in his voice, it was not his British accent \u2013 it was jet lag mixed with terror. Aww! I loved him already. Watson talked about how he had a \u201creal\u201d job testing children\u2019s hearing. When he decided to focus more on his writing, he took step backwards in his health services career by taking a more junior job and cutting back his hours. What a bold move! He was inspired to write this book after reading an obituary about man who, after a surgery to cure his epilepsy, lost the ability to make memories. One of the audience members put him on the spot and asked about comparisons to the movies, Memento and 50 First Dates. The lady was very nice, but everyone knew the underlying bite: did Watson rip them off? I thought he handled himself well. He admitted seeing Memento years and years ago. And he learned of and watched 50 First Dates only after hearing it mentioned so much when his book was published. He pointed out a key difference between Christine and Drew Barrymore character\u2019s predicaments: Drew\u2019s story was set fairly soon after the accident. Her loved ones could pretend everything was normal, because she was still young. Christine had aged a couple decades. It wasn't possible to keep up such a charade with all the wrinkles on her face. He also spoke of how he intentionally avoided all amnesia-related stories as he wrote. Let\u2019s review. Set aside time and read it alone. Savor Christine\u2019s psychological roller coaster. Don\u2019t stress too much about solving the mystery. Voila! You\u2019re in for a sweet summer thriller. ...more I think I tend to judge books more harshly when I listen to them because I can't skim the text or skip parts that bore me. BUT I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THAT'S JUST MORE HONEST. Before I Go to Sleep is a highly improbable novel that's practically a fantasy. A very slow, drawn-out, horribly written fantasy. Christine, the protagonist, wakes up in a strange bed with a strange man. He tells her he's her husband, <---C>Ben</---C>, and she has amnesia -- she cannot form short-term memories. Think Memento. Hey, in fact, I think I tend to judge books more harshly when I listen to them because I can't skim the text or skip parts that bore me. BUT I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THAT'S JUST MORE HONEST. Before I Go to Sleep is a highly improbable novel that's practically a fantasy. A very slow, drawn-out, horribly written fantasy. Christine, the protagonist, wakes up in a strange bed with a strange man. He tells her he's her husband, Ben, and she has amnesia -- she cannot form short-term memories. Think Memento. Hey, in fact, this book is just like that movie! Determined to figure out the mystery of her past, Christine sees a doctor in secret and keeps a day-to-day journal. That's pretty much all you need to know. The bulk of the book is Christine rereading her journal. Which is just ENDLESS accounts about how confusing and terrifying things are. Ugh, we get the point. Perhaps that would be realistic, but it's hardly INTERESTING for the reader. Throughout the book, one finds out (as Christine does) that her husband is lying to her about how she got amnesia (she was attacked; he tells her it's a car accident), her son (he says they have no kids; they had a son), her best friend moving away (nope), etc etc. Obviously something is creepily wrong, and yet Christine is like, \"Hmmm. GUESS I'LL JUST STAY HERE WITH THIS CREEPY LYING DUDE.\" We also discover that Christine was having an affair when she was attacked. WHICH IS ALSO WHEN I CALLED IT THAT BEN WAS ACTUALLY THE DUDE SHE WAS SLEEPING WITH. I didn't quite know how that was going to work, but when Claire (her best friend) was all, \"GIRL THAT AIN'T BEN\", I was like, \"WHAT REALLY YOU WENT THERE, YOU FUCKER????\" BASICALLY, the dude Christine was having her affair with was super obsessed with her to the point of LUNATIC CRAZY and when she tried to break the whole thing off, he went BATSHIT and TRIED TO DROWN HER IN A HOTEL BATHROOM. Then, because her memory was so shoddy and awful, her loving husband Ben (apparently in this world \"loving\" means that he's a handsome successful vegan architect) is all like, \"I CAN'T HANDLE THIS. I MUST LEAVE BECAUSE I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH AND THIS I AM CAUSING YOU SO MUCH DISTRESS. I'M GOING TO TAKE OUR SON AND LEAVE YOU IN THIS REHABILITATION CENTER.\" So then Crazy Dude, who's been staring at her through windows and shit this whole time, swoops in and...manages to convince the staff that HE's Ben (?????????????) and is all, \"YUP I'M TOTES BEN. I'M GOING TO TAKE MY WIFE HOME NOW.\" So she's been living with CRAZY UNHINGED DUDE this WHOLE TIME and he's been masquerading as her husband! I can't really go into how much I thought the plot sucked (it did; a lot, in case you were wondering) because my brain might implode. But one thing I do want to vent about is: HOW IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TO GET SOMEONE OUT OF A REHAB CENTER BY PRETENDING TO BE THEIR HUSBAND???? DO PEOPLE NOT CHECK RECORDS ANYMORE???? WHAT IS THIS SHIT??? DO REHAB CENTERS JUST LET ANYONE WALTZ OFF WITH CRITICAL AMNESIACS???? WTF???? That aside, MAN, this writing was AWFUL. The audiobook narrator did not help. She had this grating voice and whenever she read Claire, I wanted to throw my iPod out my car window. Christine is a HORRIBLE character. I mean, I was SO SHOCKED that the author was a man (haha, jk, not at all)! Once again, we have a female protagonist with no autonomy. And this time it's because her horrible cheating made it so! Ladies, no sex for you outside marriage even though dudes do it all the time, because your lover will probably try to asphyxiate you on a tile floor and then stalk you for years and years only to kidnap you and keep you hostage with him in his love shack. ISN'T THAT ALWAYS THE CASE? Also, everything was SO SLOW. The fight scene at the end when she's trying to escape from Ben/Mike and she's all like, \"I should've probably hit him again...\" when she FINALLY manages to wrench herself free from his violent attack and you're like, \"NO SHIT SHERLOCK\" and then he GRABS HER AGAIN AND THROWS HER TO THE FLOOR. COULD'VE JUST BEAMED HIM IN THE HEAD AGAIN WITH THAT STOOL AND SAVED US ALL A LOT OF TIME, YOU WORTHLESS EXCUSE FOR A CHARACTER. Oh, this is a good segue into the gratuitous violence of the book. All the scenes with violence in them (few, but they are pretty intense) are UGGGGGGH. It was like, \"and then I cracked my head against the radiator!\" \"and then he shoved me to the floor and my arm twisted behind my back!\" \"and then his hands were around my throat and I couldn't breathe!\" I was SQUIRMING on the train. I CANNOT DEAL. And, I know why this book had to be narrated in first-person present, but IT WAS SO AWFUL I CANNOT EVEN. Bee tee dubs, the character of Claire makes NO SENSE to me at all. She's supposed to be Christine's BFF and she just doesn't talk to or try to see her anymore? WOULDN'T THAT BE A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS????? If my best friend got AMNESIA and couldn't remember anything, I WOULD BE THERE EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY. EVEN if I slept with her stupid husband, I would NEVER lose contact with her. CLAIRE, YOU ARE OFFICIALLY THE WORST FRIEND EVER. CONGRATULATIONS. Dear Adam -- you suck as a son. Dear Ben -- you suck at still being in love with Christine and letting some dude pretend to be you to steal her out of the clinic. This book is really just a presentation of THE WORST PEOPLE TO HAVE IN YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR MEMORY. Congrats, SJ Watson. I'm so glad your first book is a PILE OF SHIT. ...more \u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f \u0625\u0646\u0643 \u0628\u0633\u0647\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0633\u062a\u062a\u062e\u0644\u0635

Every day is the same awakening until with the advice of a therapist, she starts to keep a journal and then incrementally adds various things she learns so that she doesn't have to totally re-learn her life every day. There is huge genius and likability in this book on many levels, from her innocent and blank feelings about her husband's silly body parts, his need for sex, her duties as his wife, memories of lust from her past, her normal and somewhat randy behavior along side of her long time best girlfriend in college, to the normal things in the average life of an average couple cooking fish and peas for dinner. Just because you're an amnesiac, it doesn't mean that you aren't intelligent and don't have instincts and feelings about the way you are being treated and cared for. As I moved along the story-line, there were many subtle clues about the real world that started to scare me, wondering what in the hell is going on, what the husband is doing, why is he so loving and patient, why does he give her slightly different answers to the same questions, what motivates him to be with her, to love her, his sexual relationship with her, etc. I don't want to give the plot away, but the book moves fairly quickly from nervousness and wondering, to extreme stress and fear. This is an excellent and unique book with many different levels of thought about life, relationships, roles, friendship, daily existence, etc. And, it gave me a little bit more insight into female thinking (or at least I once thought). I loved it. Note after the review: One of my friends told me the author is male. Dang, but I don't like the book quite as much now. LOL I'll leave the five stars but I feel a little wronged somehow. ...more I was recommending this book by one of my trusty Goodreads friends and while I wasn\u2019t too sure about it I decided to give it a go.

Her memories are not really all gone; her brain just can\u2019t piece the images together. This book is chilling; watching Christine write in her journal trying to piece together, everything she has missed in her life. The pieces don\u2019t fix and she comes to realise that her life is a lot different that she thinks it is. Making this a gripping read with unexpected twists and turns to keep you reading into the early mornings. I\u2019m really impressed that this is SJ Watson\u2019s first novel; Before I Go to Sleep is an addictive read and masterfully written. I would recommend this book to everyone one; it is a beautifully crafted book that takes you on a thrilling journey; fully of twists and turns. As far as a book is concerned, this one has it all; suspense, mystery, intrigue, sex, violence and romance. As was really impressed by this book and while have to listen to my friend in the future when it comes to book recommendations. Go out and read this book as soon as you can; it sits in my top 5 read books of the read and probably in the top 2 for best books of 2011. ...more Has anyone seen 50 First Dates ?

Can you really trust what you are being told about your life? \"There are two of me, now, in the same body: one is a forty-seven-year-old woman, calm, polite, aware of what kind of behaviour is appropriate and what is not- and the other is in her twenties, and screaming. I can't decide which is me.\" What would it be like to suddenly get up one fine day and know that you are no more in your twenties but life has passed you by and you are now in your late forties. What would it be like to feel this every day? \"I will wake up tomorrow as I did this morning. Thinking I am still a child. Thinking I still have a whole lifetime of choice ahead of me. And then I will find out, again, that I am wrong. My choices have already been made. Half my life is behind me.\" So Christine starts keeping a diary and things start taking a darker turn. Can she really trust her husband or is she really going crazy? \"My memory is not working. Things are not coming back to me. I am not getting better at all, but going mad.\" The story did keep me guessing for the most part but I was able to guess the ending at around 75% of the book. There are clues out there if you really pay attention. The ending was a bit dragged and fell into the world of clich\u00e9.

One thing that annoyed me was a fairly big thing, though. (view spoiler) [The antagonist is a total clich\u00e9. The minute he starts talking about her being in a coffee shop, and how he scrutinised what she was eating and tried to figure out the \"rules\", the ending was obvious. It's every media stereotype. And seriously, I promise you. If you went out today, you passed a mentally ill person. Driving past you, walking along the pavement behind you, in front of you... And you were in no danger. They don't care about whether you eat your snack before or after 2pm. They're not going to rape you and try to kill you, then steal you from your care home and lie to you. They're just going to buy some bread and milk, maybe some things for dinner. They've got a meeting later. Whatever. Most mentally ill people are perfectly normal people. And even the ones that you don't understand, the ones that try to figure out weird \"rules\", they're probably harmless too. It's not that there aren't people who are dangerous and mentally ill, but mentally ill people are not automatically dangerous. In fact, mentally ill people are at a higher risk of being victims of violence, not perpetrators.

I missed my stop, I forgot to pay my bill at the caf\u00e9 (I did return today to settle it and said I suffer from temporary memory loss), I bumped into things while read-walking. It\u2019s no wonder this book sold five hundred gabizzillion copies and translation rights everywhere including Atlantis and Mars, as it is fantastic and all it asks from you in return is to suspend your disbelief for about 300 pages. Seems like a small price to pay. If you have been in a coma this past year and have no idea what \u2018Before I Go To Sleep\u2019 is about, let me recap it for you: Just like in Memento, the main character suffers from anterograde amnesia but to spice things up she also has regular amnesia. Every day Christine wakes up not knowing where she is, how she got there, and why she seems to have a body of a middle aged woman, when she vaguely remembers being in her early twenties before she went to bed. The past twenty years of her life are completely gone from her memory and everything before also seems hazy. Yes, S.J. Watson is pushing it a little but you won\u2019t have much time to meditate over the probability of the premise because the ride begins on page one and doesn\u2019t stop until you close the book. It\u2019s easy to open your novel with a character waking up with no recollection of who they are or how they got where they are, it guarantees to get everyone hooked, but the trick then is to keep the tension and even pace. This is where \u2018Before I Go To Sleep\u2019 is most successful. The biggest part of the book is made of Christine\u2019s journal, which she keeps to remind herself every morning who she is and what has happened to her before. I could be nit-picky and say that if I suffered from anterograde amnesia and had to read my whole bloody diary every morning and then write what has happened before going to bed, I\u2019d try to be succinct. Otherwise I\u2019d soon end up spending all my days reading about my past and what I had for dinner, and what the weather was like and what I was wearing. But, of course it\u2019s a book , I didn\u2019t actually want to read bullet points, I wanted a narrative. Additionally, Christine is a writer by vocation, so I can forgive her for getting carried away, describing the wind and sand texture. Memory is an extraordinary thing and I almost broke my brain imagining not having it. As I was reading the book I was adding new facts to those I already knew. I was building up the story in my head and I was making progress. To poor Christine every chapter was the first chapter. Every ten to twenty pages she was back to square one and I\u2019d like congratulate Watson on doing repetitions without sounding repetitive. I\u2019m also glad that he at least made an attempt to address the psychological impact such a condition might have on a person. Waking up in a body that\u2019s decades older than you remember your body to be is pretty much waking up in somebody else\u2019s body \u2013 having that happen to you once might undo you, I can\u2019t even imagine having that happen every single day. Remember that romantic comedy \u2013 50 First Dates? It was neither romantic, nor funny. It was plain scary. She managed to have two children (or one, or three, I don\u2019t remember)! Why would you do to someone who can\u2019t remember what happened to them for the past decade? If I woke up one day, suddenly nine months pregnant, and some dude was telling me we were married and in love and that\u2019s our baby, I\u2019d say: hell no, perv! When I went to bed I was not pregnant. The aliens must\u2019ve abducted me and impregnated me with their alien baby. I\u2019d probably have a major freak-out and a miscarriage to boot. Also, think about it. Picture yourself waking up in a stranger\u2019s body in a stranger\u2019s house. That would be pretty stressful, even if someone explained everything to you, it\u2019s safe to say you\u2019d be on the edge the whole day, your heart beating fast, diarrhea, cramps, chest pain. And now imagine that happening every day. You might not remember it but your body would, you\u2019d be a wreck before you turn 40. I thought all that while I was reading and then I thought: but after all, we are all amnesiacs. We don\u2019t remember much from before the age of 3 (not that much afterwards). We look at our early photos and have no recollection of those photos being taken. We are told what we liked and how we behaved and we have no way of verifying that information. Even all those events from our life \u2013 how many of the thousands of days we lived we truly remember? We remember mostly the things we often talk about, the thing we wrote down in our journals or blogs and then reread. But the truth is we don\u2019t remember the actual events, we remember just our descriptions of them, some story we told and retold our brain until we arrived at the version we were satisfied with. So let\u2019s not fool ourselves that, we, unlike Christine, can actually rely on our memories. ...more I had high hopes for this book to be a real nail-biter, edge-of-the-seat kind of thriller, that's what the testimonials and the promotional materials bill it as.

However, what makes this story work is Watson's manipulation of reality in order to prolong the suspense. If the story had been more well grounded and believable I would have given it higher marks. There were just too many things that had to conveniently fall into place in order to make this story work up to the climax and then the ending was far too neat for reality. There are a handful of things that feel like puzzle pieces forced to fit in order to make this story work and in the end it just wasn't that clever or well thought out. If you are looking for a clever nail-biter, edge of your seat type of book I recommend Lisa Unger's 'Beautiful Lies' and the follow up story 'Sliver of Truth'. ...more The mind is an intricate thing, fragile, open to suggestion.

This book was like groundhog day - without the humour and without Bill Murray. The book received 2 stars based on the fact that this was a debut novel, it was in fact very well written and I read it all the way to the end. Unfortunately, I was quite bored and often wished I was the main character and would awake the next morning and forget I was reading the book. Plot Summary The plot revolves around a character who suffers from short term amnesia. The result being she is unable to form new memories while forgetting much of her past life. Once she sleeps and awakens the next morning, she forgets what happened the previous day, previous month and previous decades. In an effort to build a narrative of her life, she begins to write a journal detailing the day, her relationship with her husband, her previous life and the events that led to her current condition. In order to remember this book, she is daily contacted, in secret, by a doctor who tells her where to find the book. Given that she can only rely on what she had previously written, she is an unreliable narrator. Unfortunately for her, not everything is as it seems and she is left to wondering if she can trust herself or anyone around her. My Take To be honest, the premise is quite good. I loved the idea. It was like a written version of Memento -- only less awesome. Although I was taken by the premise, the first 2/3 of the book became painfully repetitive and began to stretch believability. While I like the idea of an amnesiac trying to secretly piece her life back together, I just could not believe her methods would be successful or secret. Almost from the beginning, I assumed the book would have one of two endings. *sighs* Unfortunately, I was right and I had a very hard time accepting what had happened. The setup of the story did not make it believable to me. Sure, the narrator was unreliable but I think it was used as a gimmick to stretch believability. Maybe I am being unduly harsh. I recently gave Gone Girl and Rebecca 5 star ratings and they both employed unreliable narrators. To me, the difference in these books is that the unreliable nature of the narration was not used to explain away plot weakness but was instead used to highlight the nature of the characters. In this book, I did not feel this plot device was handled well. That said, this book has many accolades. I can appreciate how some readers will find this to be thrilling and enchanting. It was well written and the plot was decent. It had a nice twisty ending and it (attempted) to explain itself in the end. Some readers will take my side and see this book as one trick pony. I found the trick to be transparent and none too exciting. Final Thoughts I am not trying to scare anyone away from reading this. I don't think it is rubbish but was simply not to my liking. If the things I listed would also bother you, you might not enjoy it. If you don't care about characterization and simply want to go for a ride, you might enjoy the trip. I generally have a high tolerance for boring books but without great characterization, I could barely hang on. Too bad. ...more If you lose your memory about people and events, then you lose yourself and you become the dupe for any and every scurrilous schemer because how can you tell who your friends are if you don't even remember them?

Imagine reading hundreds of pages written in a dull prose style with little variation to the story. Reading SJ Watson\u2019s Before I Go To Sleep is a maddening experience. For about 85% of the book (I know because I read this on a Kindle), NOTHING HAPPENS. Christine wakes up, she reads her journal (which is the novel we are reading) and relearns things about her life. I can\u2019t tell you how completely boring a reading experience this book was. The fact that it\u2019s labelled \u201cthriller\u201d is a joke \u2013 there isn\u2019t a single thrilling aspect to this story. Some readers have complained about the conceit that this novel is Christine\u2019s journal \u2013 that she constantly has to reference the fact that she\u2019s run off to write in her journal while its fresh in her mind - and how this is unrealistic, especially as its written in a very deliberate novelistic style, etc. I get that, but I\u2019ll forgive the novel that because that\u2019s just the format of the tale. But I was often reminded of HP Lovecraft\u2019s narrators who are always scribbling in their notebooks while the terror is right at their door\u2026 woooo, beware the corniness! Hang on - maybe the ending saves it? Nope. The ending is arguably what breaks this novel beyond repair. I guessed the twist ending long before it was revealed. Of course her husband \u201cBen\u201d doesn\u2019t turn out to be her real husband Ben but a crazy stalker impersonator. Except we\u2019re meant to believe that this imposter was able to discharge Christine from a mental hospital without anyone asking for ID to prove he was who he said he was. Furthermore, we\u2019re supposed to believe that Christine \u2013 a person with massive mental problems that has left her hospitalised for significant lengths of time \u2013 would receive no follow-up visits from a nurse, psychologist or care-giver. See, in Britain we have the NHS, so most people have free healthcare. It doesn\u2019t work exactly like that but I won\u2019t get into the intricacies of it here. I\u2019ll just say that someone like Christine would easily qualify for the kind of services that would send a professional to her home on a weekly, fortnightly, or monthly basis. The fact that we\u2019re supposed to believe that a complete stranger could take a severely ill patient out of an institution and then keep them hostage for months on end without a healthcare professional doing a follow-up visit, or that her son or friends wouldn\u2019t call or find out why they haven\u2019t heard from her for months, is asking too much of this reader. It\u2019s frankly insulting to think anyone would be so stupid as to swallow Watson\u2019s scenario whole. And in the author\u2019s bio it says he worked in the NHS for \u201cmany years\u201d \u2013 how does he not know things like this?! And Dr Nash \u2013 is he the world\u2019s worst doctor? How did he not pick up on any of this in his multiple sessions with her? Also, instead of helping her, he ends up flirting with her! He\u2019s an appalling medical \u201cprofessional\u201d! Then at the end Christine conveniently gets her memory back! Everything about the plot is hopelessly contrived. You can only suspend disbelief so far. I can\u2019t think of a single positive thing to say about this book. The characters are dull. The story is comatose until the last 15% of the book and then it\u2019s a gibbering mess of nonsense. Watson\u2019s writing is repetitious, flat and lifeless. The bulk of the novel is beyond boring and the ending beggars belief, it\u2019s so bad. I cannot believe a single person would enjoy this dreck and yet there are literally thousands of people who have. I am stunned. Dennis Lehane\u2019s Shutter Island is a masterpiece and a genuine thriller along similar lines to Before I Go To Sleep and I recommend reading that instead. I\u2019m now going to do my best to forget this drivel but not the name of this writer, so I never have to suffer through another of his novels again! ...more \"Before I Go To Sleep\" by S. J.

Chrissy can remember everything that happens to her during the day but as soon as she goes into a deep sleep, her brain erases all her adult memory; resulting in Christine waking up next to a stranger-her husband Ben?

Even though this is not what the Christine Lucas character struggles with in the book-she has Anterograde amnesia -there are enough similarities- that my mind would wander into my own life instead of reading what was on the page. This, however is not the reason for my three star rating. I would have given it four stars if it wasn't for the ending.

(view spoiler) [Christine suddenly has her memory back or large chunks of it at least, because the supposed traumatic event is over, and Mike has been expunged from existence. It seemed a tad convenient for me. S.J. Watson may, or may not, have consumed an illegal substance during this period, and there\u2019s a decent chance he may have inhaled.

It had a different feel to it, and I was turned on enough to want to know what happened, but I did have a sinking suspicion I had the ending figured out before it arrived. For those of you who don\u2019t like tangents, you\u2019ll probably want to skip right on over this part. Let\u2019s get one thing straight: There are no original plotlines. The well of lost plots has been used up, drying faster than the Nevada desert. Sure, it\u2019s easy enough to make the argument that this story is similar to Memento , but so what? We might as well take every romance and mystery off the shelves\u2026and sit around and wait for someone to come up with something \u201coriginal.\u201d I\u2019ll save you the suspense: You probably have a better chance of meeting a little green alien, having him tickle your forehead, and then receiving a wet smack to the lips. Guess what? The Fast & The Furious is essentially the same as Point Break , only there\u2019re cars and car racing instead of surfing. And the director of The Fast & The Furious is in preproduction on a remake of Point Break . You\u2019re welcome. But let\u2019s get to the good news: Even without an endless number of plots, there are an endless number of ideas and experiences and opportunities and characters that writers can bring to the table, bringing an essential \u201cuniqueness\u201d to the creative drawing board. The Fast & The Furious feels different from Point Break because the characters are different. End tangent.
