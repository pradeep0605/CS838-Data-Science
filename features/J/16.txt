Years and years and years have passed while I have worked in a bookstore and every single year is the same, some kind of cool hipster guy or girl will come in and ask for anything by Chuck Palahniuk, bestowing praises upon his writing. Okay, I get it. The hipsters love him. Brad Pitt was in a movie based on a Palahnuik book, which was about crazy wacky anarchy, which the young hipsters love. So, I finally sat myself down and cracked open this lovely bird of a book. I wanted to like it. I really did. I wanted to be part of that faction... the I love Chuck Palahnuik, I smoke Camels, I roll the cuffs of my jeans and wear studded belts, but only on occasion, cause really I wear AE gear, but not AE gear bought from an actual AE store, but from a thrift shop, where it costs roughly the same amount of money if I were to buy it new, but I didn't, someone else, a stranger in fact, wore this shirt before me, thus I am cooler than you cause I bought this shirt at a thrift shop, and I have a tattoo... maybe I have two... you'll never know cause I'm mysterious, and I play the guitar, but not really, I can only play three cords, but really that's enough to make it seem like I know what I'm doing, have you ever read Vonnegut? I didn't like this book. I didn't hate it. I just didn't like it. A poem (lullaby) that has the ability to kill people when read aloud? I thought those were called Mattie Stepanek poems. ZING! Sorry Mattie fans. I know the kid got dealt a bad card(s), but seriously? Have you read his stuff? ...more To most people a lullaby is a soothing song meant to help coax a child to sleep, but in Chuck Palahniuk\u2019s hands it becomes a death spell that can kill anyone. Of course, that\u2019s not twisted enough for Chuckie P. so he had to throw in some witchcraft, necrophilia and dead babies to really make it a party. <---C>Carl Streator</---C> is a newspaper reporter working on a feature about infant crib deaths, and he has his own tragic experience in that area.

Of course, that\u2019s not twisted enough for Chuckie P. so he had to throw in some witchcraft, necrophilia and dead babies to really make it a party. Carl Streator is a newspaper reporter working on a feature about infant crib deaths, and he has his own tragic experience in that area. When Streator sees a book containing an African chant at several homes where the baby died, he does more digging and discovers that it\u2018s a culling song that can be used to kill just by thinking it. Since Carl has a few anger problems, this leads to a lot of deaths of people who annoy him as he tries to get control. Streator seeks help from Helen Hoover Boyle a realtor who specializes in flipping haunted houses and who also knows the culling song. He convinces her that they should take a road trip to destroy all the copies of the book, but her secretary Mona, a witch wannabe, and her animal rights activist and all around asshole of a boyfriend Oyster end up coming along for the ride. Mona also convinces them that the culling song probably came from a powerful spell book they should try to locate. The culling song is a nifty hook for the story and Streator\u2019s tendency to off anyone who\u2019s pissing him off provides some dark hilarity. My biggest problem with this one is that Streator is a complete moron. He instantly realizes the chaos that would occur if anyone else figured out the culling song and how to use it, but then he promptly blabs about it to Mona and a disgusting EMT with a penchant for corpse sex. He often can't control himself with the culling song and kills people for offenses like having their TV\u2019s too loud or bumping into him on the street, yet somehow he manages not to whack the ultra-annoying Oyster. Then he invites Oyster and Mona on the road to destroy the book. So you\u2019re trying to destroy a dangerous spell that can kill people and you bring along a guy who spends every waking moment telling you all the crimes people have committed against animals. Guess how well that turns out? ...more Chuck has never been a very good writer. He comes up with interesting ideas, uses them as a vehicle for a shitty novel, then I read it, and am disappointed every time. I have since stopped reading his books but my girlfriend says they still suck. Eudora Welty once said something to the effect that Southern gothic works because people in the South can still recognize grotesque. Chuck Palahniuk may be the vanguard of the post-modern gothic literary group as he can definitely recognize what is grotesque in our culture. \u201cSticks and stones can break my bones, but words can never hurt me\u201d is an old saying that Palahniuk dissects and violates with an impish joy usually only seen in 8th grade biology.

Centered around the unfortunate discovery of an old African culling song that can kill when read (or thought) Palahniuk creates a loose allegory that examines how our saturation with noise and our hyper addiction to media has created a blunted, spiritually lethal society. Like reading Christopher Moore I cringe when I read Palahniuk\u2019s work, feeling guilty for laughing, but buried amidst the bizarre scenarios and the locker room humor are social and cultural insights that are worth the effort. This is more like Invisible Monsters than Fight Club , but as entertaining as either in its own weird Kafkaesque way and demonstrating a common misanthropic thread that may connect all of his work. ...more When you pick up a Chuck Palahniuk book you know that you are going to plunge ever-so-briefly into a raging torrent of absurdity, horror so whimsical that you laugh even as you cringe, and insightful looks at contemporary living. It seems a cheap shot to call his work formulaic, but once you've read through 6 or 7 of his books, the pattern emerges and you have a vague idea of what to expect.

It was <+++>Lullaby</+++> that finally brought this realization home to me. You have the protagonist, a man who seems like the picture of upstanding normality at first glance but who is eventually revealed to have a dark secret hidden in his past. You have the more experienced secondary character who helps to drive the story forward by slowly revealing some answers to the mystery. Then you have the comical minor characters, the latter-day Rosencratz and Guildenstern (or the R2D2 and C3PO if you want to take it that far) if you will, who play an important roll in the advancement of events but who also provide the brilliant moments of macabre hilarity. At some point they will all go on a roadtrip and Palahniuk will ruminate on the state of human existence at the turn of the 21st Century. And so it goes for Lullaby. Features reporter Carl Streator is assigned to report on crib death for a mid-size Portland newspaper. As he visits site after site of these tragic deaths, he notices the constant appearance of a book of children's poems all laying open to Page 27. It appears that prior to dying the infants had all been read this particular poem. Being the thorough investigative reporter that he is, Streator traces crib deaths in his area back over 20 years until he comes across Helen Hoover Boyle, a Realtor who specializes in selling (and reselling and reselling again) haunted houses to unsuspecting clients, who may know the reason why this particular poem seems to kill. It's not long before Streator, Helen, her assistant Mona (known as Mulberry in the Wiccan circles in which she travels) and Mona's boyfriend Oyster embark on a roadtrip across the country to track down every copy of this culling poem to protect the sleeping infants of the world from inadvertent death. Like I said it's formulaic, but this just makes it easier to focus on the odd details that Palahniuk likes to toss into the mix. Oyster's long narrations about the history of invasive foreign plants and how this can be used as a means to understand the cannibalistic psyche of modern man, an EMT who learns the culling poem so that he can kill fashion models and then have sex with their dead bodies, the twisted history of antique furniture- they all add together to form a novel that, while not spectacular, definitely envelops you and reminds you why it is that Palahniuk stands out as one of the best contemporary authors of today. ...more The war of who can crank their radio louder than their neighbor.

The premise of the book is a little hokey but Chuck's writing is so good you forget that magic doesn't exist and fall in love with the ridiculousness of the situation and you generally don't stop laughing long enough to think twice. It might seem to drag a little past the middle but hang with the characters till he gets all the loose ends wrapped up. It's pretty well worth it. ...more Brilliant. That's the word, the only word, that came to mind as I started reading Palahniuk's Lullaby. I struggled to keep reading, as I was too impressed with the prose. As a writer, reading Palahniuk made me feel like a dancing monkey in comparison. By the time I hit the halfway mark, I struggled to keep reading for an altogether different reason. It had become too fragmented, repetitive, and just plain boring. At the beginning, this passage stopped me. Full stop. Absolute. No going further ou Brilliant.

It had become too fragmented, repetitive, and just plain boring. At the beginning, this passage stopped me. Full stop. Absolute. No going further out of awe: \"Helen, she's wearing a white suit and shoes, but not Snow White. It's more the white of downhill skiing in Banff with a private car and driver on call, fourteen pieces of matched luggage, and a suite at the Hotel Lake Louise.\" By the time I had reached page 116, about halfway through, I've read about twenty passages stylistically the same. This color. But not color like this, more like this extended metaphor. Dull. First time, brilliant. First few times, brilliant. Twentieth, dull. Okay. I might be exaggerating with the twenty mark. I didn't count, but it's repetitive enough to make it annoying. Unlike his other \"choruses,\" like \"I know this because Tyler knows this\" or \"these noise-aholics, these peace-aphobics\" (and all the variations on that theme) or the counting to remain calm, it doesn't tie anything together. It doesn't do a thing past a look-at-how-well-I-can-write. Over and over, which defeats its own purpose. It's like those movie scenes so overdone they're obviously this-is-my-Oscar-winning-performance-scene. Again with the ads Oyster, one of the many despicable characters in this novel, takes out to blackmail corporations. Really. Really. Old. I get it. I don't have to be beaten over the head with it. **spoilers** \u00a0-- \u00a0**trigger warnings** Then, on page 177 (Ch 29), after I skipped dozens of pages of the same-ol', same-ol' repetition, where no new character development is revealed nor is the plot projected forward, I came to the part where Streater remembers orally and vaginally raping his dead wife. Of course, he only thought she was unconscious, so it was just rape, not necrophilia. \"It's not rape if they're dead.\" This is where I stopped reading. Not sure which was more disturbing, the fact that Streater calls it \"the best he had\" since before his child was born or that he didn't even bother to check on her after he got off with her unconscious, unresponsive form. I'm utterly disgusted by Palahniuk, and I'm not sure I'll be reading anymore. Darkness is one thing. Disturbing is one thing, and I like things very dark, but something about this is beyond revolting. Thankfully, the protagonist and everyone, really, are all horrific people, so at least the rape isn't brushed off as something acceptable. That's the only thing that might get me to try another book. This is the first Palahniuk book in which I'd gotten this far. I'm partially into Fight Club at the moment, the second time I've tried to read it. The first I found difficult to keep going for the same reason at the beginning: blown away by the prose. That, coupled with the movie playing in my head, made it hard for me to read. I'm trying again, and I hope to get through it this time. Two stars, only because of the brilliant prose. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. ...more Palahniuk makes another social statement(criticism) with Lullaby, but this time with more humor than he's mustered in any of his other books. It definitely helps to be somewhat cynical about the modern world, if you want to enjoy this book (good rule of thumb w/ any C.P books).

But even if you love life, there's much to appreciate in the this book, mainly the fact that it's hysterically funny and the events that occur that are really bizarre. The story revolves around the main character who stumbles across a culling song (poem that is used to euthanize the suffering) and eventually reveals more magic spells that begin to be abused by people for their own benefit. Pretty much everything that happens in this story is totally absurd, which is one of the things that's great about it. If you're someone who likes everything neatly wrapped up in a believable package, you won't like this book at all. But if you're willing to have a little fun and enjoy some really humorous moments then you'll appreciate Lullaby. ...more The only novel by the acclaimed author of Fight Club that I've read, this book is more or less an essay concerning the contaminating effects caused by the constant \"noise\" to which Americans have grown accustomed in their lives.

Be it mass media, advertisements everywhere one turns, or talking heads always telling one what to do and when to do it, this noise is everywhere, and utterly inescapable, the author argues. While I generally agree with the author's displeasure over constant sensory overload, the overt bombardment of social commentary in this book is so over-the-top and unending that it is akin to the \"noise\" which the author proclaims to so disdain. The author's caterwauling is intermittently suspended to give beatification to the libertine nature of the characters' sexuality. In addition, the novel\u2019s main plot device is an epidemic of SIDS sweeping the nation, a distasteful and gratuitous illustration into the morbidly macabre mind of the author. In summary, the author's egotistical perception of himself as a social doyen (which I've been told is a given in any Palahniuk novel) merely turns me off from his argument, causing a desire in me to stand up and scream, \"ENOUGH!\" Yes, silence is one of the rarest and most valuable gifts of nature. And although people are, indeed, regularly exposed to an unavoidable amount of noise throughout their day, it is ultimately up to each person whether or not he decides to get up and turn off the TV. ...more Palahniuk, the Portlander (Oregon, not Maine) who wrote the cult classic Fight Club, has four other novels.

Helen Hoover Boyle and her assistant Mona listen to a police scanner for deaths (and potential sales) and field calls from frightened new homeowners who have bought what Helen calls \"distressed\" (haunted) houses. Helen sells the same homes over and over, creating a niche market with a steady income. Chapter two is from the perspective of an unknown character, whose identity isn't revealed until much later in the book. This narrator is hunting miracles: the Flying Virgin, who appeared in New Mexico and wrote \"STOP HAVING BABYS\" in the sky with a can of Bug-Off brand insect fogger; the Roadkill Jesus Christ/I-84 Messiah, who restores dead animals to their pre-accident conditions; the Judas Cow, at the Stone River Meatpacking plant in Nebraska, who refused to lead a herd of cows into the slaughterhouse, and instead took a seat and spoke at length about giving up meat, taught its audience a Hindi song, and answered questions about the nature of life and death. The third chapter brings us to Carl Streator, a journalist trained to note details. Assigned to do a series of stories on crib death for the Lifestyles section of his newspaper, he visits the parents and homes of recently deceased babies. On his first visit, he notes, among other things, an open library book on a wicker chest in the nursery. This book, Poems and Rhymes from Around the World, is open to page 27. Carl diligently writes down the eight-line traditional African poem - a culling song, a lullaby, the book says - in his notes. This poem shows up at each of the homes he visits; he's found a pattern. In his editor's office, he reads the poem aloud. The next day, the editor doesn't show up for work. Carl has a problem with anger management and soon discovers bodies piling up around him. Mona, the realtor's assistant, is a Wiccan who recognizes Carl's power and the story just gets stranger from there. Carl, Helen, Mona, and Mona's boyfriend Oyster set out on a road trip to track down and destroy every copy of the poem. Palahnuik's writing style is sometimes choppy and repetitive, which took a little to get used to. This story, which might be considered a magical realism murder mystery, is brilliantly conceived. The plot doesn't just twist, it writhes. For a little while, I had no idea what was going on. I became mildly frustrated. But I was already hooked, so I pressed on and finally things started coming together. The trip was worth it. And I think Palahniuk effectively taps into that irritated, misanthropic side of humanity that would never publicly admit that, \"Yeah, once in awhile, I wouldn't mind having a culling song handy...\" ...more Chuck took me on an interesting ride with Lullaby. It\u2019s about a culling poem that will kill people when they hear it. But that\u2019s a very simple way of explaining this book, there\u2019s a lot more to it. It has several themes but it seems to be mostly about how people are never in total control of themselves. We are all possessed by something.

I liked the way he talked about people that have problems with excess (ie. Drinking, eating, gambling, etc\u2026) are actually being possessed by ghosts of people who couldn\u2019t get enough of those things while they were still alive. It does seem like that. Some people can have all sorts of control of their life but yet in certain areas, have no control. There is great deal of humor throughout and I found myself laughing out loud several times. He has a twisted sense of humor that resonates well my twisted sense of humor. Much like Choke and Beautiful You, this book features a character who has a scheme of making money that is dark and twisted. She sell\u2019s houses that are haunted and then gets the owners to keep quiet so she can sell it again within six months. It\u2019s great stuff. I see the pattern in his books now which Fight Club hammered home with such solid force. Chuck writes about a modern world where people are dysphoric and depressed and they want what they think is there\u2019s. Stepping on someone else\u2019s toes is ok if the end justifies the means. Our world of ultra-consumerism has created a society of people going me me me with no end in sight and Chuck paints this picture exceptionally well. ...more Lullaby was my first book to read by Chuck Palahniuk.

In my opinion, the power of Palahniuk's style is in his use of repeated phrases. This book was about the power of words and the power of humans to change the world (good and bad). With words as a central theme in the book, Palahniuk constructs many rhymes and phrases that are mentioned often through the book: \"Sticks and stones can break your bones, but words will kill you...\", \"These noisaholics, these quietophobics...\" They are very well-placed, and really add to the overall meaning of the story. The writing was very raw, enough to make me cringe at times, but I still enjoyed the overall story. ...more \u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d0\u10da\u10d8\u10d0, \u10d7\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8\u10d3\u10d0\u10dc \u10d9\u10e3\u10e1 \u10dc\u10d0\u10d1\u10d8\u10ef\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10d7 \u10db\u10d8\u10d5\u10d1\u10dd\u10d1\u10e6\u10d0\u10d5\u10d3\u10d8, \u10db\u10d0\u10d2\u10e0\u10d0\u10db \u10d1\u10dd\u10da\u10dd\u10e1 \u10d8\u10e1\u10d4\u10d7\u10d8 \u10e1\u10d0\u10d8\u10dc\u10e2\u10d4\u10e0\u10d4\u10e1\u10dd \u10d3\u10d0 \u10e9\u10d0\u10db\u10d7\u10e0\u10d4\u10d5\u10d8 \u10d0\u10e6\u10db\u10dd\u10e9\u10dc\u10d3\u10d0, \u10e1\u10e3\u10da \u10d3\u10d0\u10db\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8\u10ec\u10e7\u10d0 \u10d3\u10d0\u10e1\u10d0\u10ec\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8 \u10e0\u10dd\u10db \u10db\u10d0\u10e5\u10d5\u10e1 1000 \u10e1\u10d8\u10e2\u10e7\u10d5\u10d8\u10d0\u10dc\u10d8 \u10d4\u10e1\u10d4 (\u10d0\u10e0\u10d0\u10d3\u10d0, \u10e9\u10d4\u10db\u10d8 \u10db\u10dd\u10db\u10d0\u10d5\u10d0\u10da\u10d8 \u10d2\u10d0\u10e0\u10d9\u10d5\u10d4\u10e3\u10da\u10ec\u10d8\u10da\u10d0\u10d3 \u10d0\u10db\u10d0\u10d6\u10d4\u10d0 \u10d3\u10d0\u10db\u10dd\u10d9\u10d8\u10d3\u10d4\u10d1\u10e3\u10da\u10d8). \u10f0\u10dd\u10d3\u10d0, \u10d8\u10db\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d7\u10e5\u10db\u10d0 \u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d3\u10dd\u10d3\u10d0, \u10e0\u10dd\u10db \u10db\u10dd\u10db\u10ee\u10d8\u10d1\u10da\u10d4, \u10e9\u10d0\u10d9, \u10eb\u10d0\u10da\u10d8\u10d0\u10dc \u10db\u10dd\u10db\u10ee\u10d8\u10d1\u10da\u10d4.

But just because it's an easy read doesn't mean it's not thought provoking. Palahniuk wrote Fight Club which was made into a movie starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. (If you haven't seen the movie, go see it - it combines the uncertainty of a Sixth Sense or the confusion of a Memento with the light hearted social critique/commentary of Trainspotting or The Big Lebowski.) The movies I choose as metaphors to describe Fight Club probably say something interesting about me, but I'd rather not psychoanalyze myself right now. Anyway, Lullaby is about what it sounds like, a lullaby, but it's also about death, guilt, and the corruptive force of power as it affects a reporter, a real estate agent and a couple of vegan Wiccans. It begins with an unexpected twist, and shortly follows that up with an explanation of what the lullaby is all about. At this point, after only about 20 pages in, you begin to wonder what Palahniuk was thinking when he wrote the book since he seems to have thrown all the good stuff into the beginning. But it continues to mystify, and then reveal those mystifications at odd moment throughout the novel, with the final twist being held off until the last few pages. If you're looking for a quick, easy summer read and something a little edgier than a romance, feel good story, or chick lit, this is a quick and dirty book I would recommend reading, particularly if you liked Fight Club or you're looking for something out of the ordinary. My tolerance for \"ickiness\" seems to be much higher than some of my book club members because the overwhelming response to this book was that there were some really despicable and graphically descriptive parts (despicable characters and a lot more description of dead/damaged bodies than some people cared for). I was the only one who found the main character, Streacher, interesting. Although I couldn't condone the character's behaviour, I could certainly understand it, and I think Palahniuk did a pretty good job getting into the mind of an uptight middle-aged man with an excessively large amount of emotional baggage. So a caveat to my sense of the book would be that if you don't like to hear icky descriptions of the body, don't read this book... though if you've seen Fight Club, you've already seen that kind of icky when Robert gets shot, or when Norton's character pulls out his tooth. ...more It's been a few years since I read this book but I just happened to see it in my recommendations and wanted to nip this in the bud before GoodReads decided to do me anymore favors.

I remember reading this with expectations built on everyone telling me how great and awesome it was. Even though I wasn't into spreading my literary wings at the time, I gave it a go because who doesn't trust their friends? Liars, all of them. Lullaby is like some pretentious, avant-garde art piece that is supposed to say \" hey guys, society is really messed up\" but instead it makes you wonder how you could swindle people into thinking you have talent too. Chuck is a wish-I-was Burroughs and an even more overrated Vonnegut. The best part of this book was the summary that made me eager to read it, however, the story hidden in the pages was boring enough to send a coma into a coma. So over-the-top and ridiculous with such a thin plot; I have no idea what possessed me to finish it, but I did and I put it in a donation box and sent that sucker to Goodwill for some other poor fool with liars for friends to pick up. ...more Divertente e terribilmente reale. Diventa forse un po' troppo confuso alla fine, ma comunque un ottimo libro, indubbiamente superiore a Fight Club. Sublime il personaggio di Helen Hoover Boyle. Attention Readers of Edgy Black Writings, of Chuck Palahniuk If you've read Lullaby and have felt bored you are not alone. OKay, so this is my fourth Palahniuk book and I enjoyed the first three so much (Survivor, Choke, & Invisible Monsters)and I was very excited to read this.

I mean I love the idea of the culling song and having the power to kill by voice even if you just say it in your head but I think the characters and the plot left me not intrested. Carl Streator was an okay character but I think by the end with all these plot twists I just didn't believe the story as much. Maybe is was the witchcraft thing. My favorite part the part with the chili bowl because it added suspense. I pictured the book in a SE7EN type of enviorment but maybe it just needs a second read. Don't get me wrong either I love Chuck, I mean I've read all these books in a row but this missed, sorry. And it's like I got bored of his writing either because I read RANT after this and thought it was great, so I'll try reading a second time and maybe that will help. But by judging my first time, I say read it before his others so you don't compare it with his other books but if it turns you off just realize it gets a hell of alot better than this just try RANT. ...more \u0631\u0628\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0634\u062f \u0645\u0627 \u0642\u0631\u0623\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0642\u062f \u0644\u0644\u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u060c \u062a\u0634\u0627\u0643 \u0628\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0643 \u064a\u0641\u062a\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0647\u064a\u0628\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0637\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0649 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0626\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u062a\u0631\u0636\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0626\u0629\u060c \u0643\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0643\u0644\u0647\u0645. \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0630 \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u060c \u0648\u062a\u0639\u0648\u064a\u0630\u0629 \u0633\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u062d\u0642\u0642 \u0623\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0621 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0627\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0641\u0648\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u0637\u0627\u0644\u060c \u062a\u062d\u0648\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0648\u064a\u0630\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0641 \u0622\u0644\u0647\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0646\u062a\u0647\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0643\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u062a\u064a \u0628\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0643 \u0646\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062a\u0627\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u062c\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u064a\u0631\u060c \u0628\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u062a\u0623\u062a\u064a \u0623\u063a\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u062f \u0628\u0646\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0646\u0635\u0641 \u0645\u0641\u062a\u0648\u062d\u0629\u060c \u062a\u062a\u064a\u062d \u0644\u0646\u0627 -

I The only real knowledge I had about Chuck Palahnuik was though the film Fight Club. (Which a terrific flick and excellently directed and photographed. It\u2019s gotta be in my top 25-50 of all time.) I had never read one of his books before. Until now. I checked Lullaby out of the library as I was browsing around looking for something new and interesting. The librarian who checked me out remarked that he is one of her favorite authors and she owns all of his books. So I was intrigued. And this book? It\u2019s good. Imaginative, bold, and seething with scathing commentary on contemporary American society and its willingness to be governed by consumerist culture, and content in its indifference and ignorance, Lullaby is a richly padded and darkly nihilistic parable about morality and power, with a dash of hopelessness sprinkled in. It may sound like a downer but Chuck Palahnuik\u2018s charm lies in his use of language. He has a gifted hand, aided by a thoughtful mind. Reading it, each word seems deliberate. The book isn\u2019t so much nuanced as it is direct. Carl Streator tells it like it is. How he sees it. How he feels about it. Unusual in its tone and unapologetic in its message, Lullaby is narrative that is strangely pleasurable despite the nightmare it weaves. The novel is also peppered with repeated phrases, slightly altered each time it appears. They begin to take on a sort of sing-song quality in and of themselves. And how appropriate for a story named after a kind of song. \u201cSticks and stones may break your bones but words _____.\u201d \u2014 \u201cThese _____-oholics. These _____-ophobics.\u201d \u2014 \u201cFor whatever reason, I thought of _____.\u201d Another repeated technique is that as Streator describes color\u2013what someone is wearing for instance\u2013he assigns it the color of a fine dining dish. It\u2019s really kind of cool. Since the film Fight Club was about all I knew about Chuck Palahnuik, I must admit that the themes and overt messages of Lullaby are familiar. Like the narrator in Fight Club, Carl Streator rants on about people. Their irritating manners. Their rude behavior. Their sick minds. But it still feels fresh and relevant. You respect the viewpoint because you can understand it. Streator is a lonely man, a bitter man. He does little more than exist until his life is forever-changed by the power a single poem holds. This story is an adventure. There\u2019s a high body count. He can\u2019t control himself. But he wants to. All he has to do is think the poem the person that has inflamed his annoyance drops dead. He practices counting exercises to direct his death wishes away from unknowing victims. \u201cCounting 345, counting 346, counting 347\u2026\u201d Hmm, yet another repeated phrase. The book is a lot of things. Thrilling. Depressing. Satisfying. All at once, and not necessarily in that order. The ending leaves you contemplating the new world order that now exists in the Lullaby world and I found myself thinking, now that would be an interesting television show! This story is filled with a variety of vividly imagined characters, each with their own views on modern life and morality. And they are all chasing the power of magic, hoping to wield it for their own uses. This was a fascinating read. Even a fun one. The words themselves are lyrical and flitter off of the page in a wonderful melody. Sticks and stones may break your bones but these words are quite astounding. ...more My interest in Palahniuk was selfish: since suffering the loss of a loved one, experiencing a mental breakdown at PDX airport and, two days later, being terminated from my hellish job and thrown blindly into unemployment with no health insurance, no savings and a laundry list of neurological pills that needed popping (prescribing, and purchasing, too...)

I was desperate for a distraction. This book is aaaaallllllll about the distraction, the noise, and the general clusterfuck that spins on around us, preventing us from thinking. It's characterized as the good and the bad; honestly, how much do you really want to focus on your life when your life seems so hopeless and backwards? \"Lullaby\" centers around a reporter's discovery and subsequent utilization of a \"culling song,\" or a poem recited to individuals to put them to sleep, put them out of their misery...basically you direct the words to them, and they die. Someone has placed the poem in a book of verses from around the world, and parents are reading it to their babies, and a mysterious surge in SIDS deaths has compelled the reporter to find the connection. The song is the connection: and, now that he knows, he holds the power of life and death over the cacophonous world around him. Call it how you see it: in some ways this book is about a man's moral struggle with the power he finds. In some ways, a road trip, finding copies of the book with cohorts who all want something else from the grimoire from which the poem originated. In others, it's about the choices set before them when the grail (of sorts) is found. Save the world by healing and teaching and making positive changes? Rule the world by killing off your enemies and empowering your allies? Turn everything into ashes and dust, and let the world begin again? Or... I can't recommend it highly enough.

I mean come on, I gave the first, \"Twilight,\" installment a chance. While this is not a good arguement to support ANYTHING it was convincing enough for me to try, \"Chuck P.\" This being said, I really enjoyed the novel, \"Lullaby.\" Serve me some of that kool-aid cause it is tasty! In short, this novel introduces a reader to the concept of a, \"culling song.\" A chant that when spoken is lethal to whoever is listening. The plot revolves around a circle of amusing quirky characters, all fighting for power over this supernatural anomaly. I found the majority of this book to be extremely entertaining. \"Lullaby,\" was the perfect representation of outlandish human behavior, brought on by great supernatural power. What's the line, \"absolute power corrupts absolutely?\" In truth, the only complaint I had regarding, \"Lullaby,\" was I found Chuck Palahniuk's writing a little, \"preachy,\" at times. As you may guess, this book brought up a \"myriad\" of ethical questions. As a reader, I found Chuck Palahniuk repeatedly drilling them into my brain. In my opinion, if a reader is not aware enough to identify these questions for themselves, a Chuck Palahniuk book is probably dangerous in their hands. All this being said, you will most likely find me in the future \"slugging\" down a latte, blasting the latest Interpol album, with a Chuck Palahniuk book in my hand. ...more How words can be so powerful.

How you are never sure whether the life you're having is the life you want or the life you've been trained to want. How you would come to think that your mind is never ever yours alone. How they--from God to tv commercials--control your thoughts for you. To occupy you so you won't be able to have the time to think about things. So you won't have time to actually rebel. Experts in ancient Greek culture say that people back then didn't see their thoughts as belonging to them. When ancient Greeks had a thought, it occurred to them as a god or goddess giving an order. Apollo was telling them to be brave. Athena was telling them to fall in love. Now people hear a commercial for sour cream potato chips and rush out to buy, but now they call this free will. At least the ancient Greeks were being honest. Lullaby , so far in my Chuck reads, is Chuck's most direct attack to the idea of God. And to society wanting to control you. It's also kind of a light read when it comes to Chuck's way of narrating. It isn't spilling too much repetitive sentences. ( Diary on the other hand IS FULL of repetitions). And our hero, Carl Streator, isn't much of a nihilist in the beginning. Big Brother isn\u2019t watching. He\u2019s singing and dancing. He\u2019s pulling rabbits out of a hat. Big Brother\u2019s busy holding your attention every moment you\u2019re awake. He\u2019s making sure you\u2019re always distracted. He\u2019s making sure you\u2019re fully absorbed. ...more Cortita, se lee bien, impactante, como lo que he le\u00eddo/visto de Palahniuk, pero no est\u00e1 a la altura de Fantasmas.

Like all of Palahniuk\u2019s work, Lullaby is a fairly strange, twisted take on society. In this case, the focus is on folklore and the rather corrupt moral compass that seems to drive modern man.

His characters are painted in vivid, near comic terms at times, and their motivations are fairly transparent. The Like all of Palahniuk\u2019s work, Lullaby is a fairly strange, twisted take on society. In this case, the focus is on folklore and the rather corrupt moral compass that seems to drive modern man. For anyone who\u2019s read Palahniuk before, you probably already know what to expect from his writing. He uses a fairly informal tone and relies on short, rapid sentences to keep the action moving. His characters are painted in vivid, near comic terms at times, and their motivations are fairly transparent. The paths of his stories, however, are typically less obvious, and Lullaby is no exception. For this novel, Palahniuk asks the question \u2013 what would you do if you had the power to kill painless, without any violence or noticeable evidence of the crime? It\u2019s a question that naturally came to Palahniuk after his father was killed by the ex-boyfriend of a woman he was dating. The question as asked in the novel is folded into the idea that certain African lullabies \u2014 culling songs \u2013 are infused with the magical ability to kill the people who hear them. When an inquisitive reporter begins to do a feature piece on babies who have died of SIDS, he slowly unearths the cause that links them together. While this sets off the main course of the novel, it also gives Palahniuk the tools he needs to examine the broader question of how our society would actually use this ability. As one would expect, the variety is huge, ranging from social correction to personal gratification to pure impulse killing. Throughout Palahniuk\u2019s exploration, the reader is fairly consistently challenged with characters that are less than moral and yet somehow likable even in their absurdity. And so you never forget who\u2019s writing the story, the details can turn strange or twisted at the drop of a hat. Even though I wouldn\u2019t call it a horror novel, I will say that the premise and structure of Palahniuk\u2019s work is interesting to behold. For fans of Fight Club, you won\u2019t find the same fast paced, surprising revelations in Lullaby, but you will be treated to the same sardonic, black humor. ...more Un romanzo basato su un'idea non nuovissima ma comunque interessante: una filastrocca che uccide all'istante la persona a cui viene recitata, e personaggi sufficientemente folli da sfruttare senza troppi ripensamenti un potere simile.

It is also a poignant look at our modern society the funniest parts of the book are the parts which are also so painfully true. Reading one of his books is truly unlike reading anything else. He has his own unique voice, and such an original style. This is also the kind of book that makes the reader question themselves as to what they would do if they were put in the same situation as the characters. The story revolves around this powerful book of ancient magic which has been discovered, and the cast of eccentric characters who are made of its awareness and each want to use it to reshape the world into their own image, their own ideal of what would make the world a better place, and this both brings them together, and tears them apart. ...more I really need to sort out my feelings with Palahniuk.
