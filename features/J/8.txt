It gave me an 'AHA* moment or two, having clarified the reason behind the WTF moment a bit. Then came Book three. Holy schmoly macaroli! Book three brought every single thing together in a way that had me standing up and cheering. Outstanding! Now we have the fourth book. This one is a wonderful read as well. There are some completely unexpected events that had me grinning & nodding and mouthing the words \"Well played, Joe. Well played.\" The Harbingers may or may not be the final book in this particular series. The ending left it open to go either way, and did so in a very satisfactory manor. I'm happy here, but would also be happy to see some these characters again. That,<---M> my friends</---M>, is the mark of a most excellent writer. I highly recommend The Damnation Chronicles if you are into fantasy-horror with a touch of sci-fi here and there. Loved it! ...more Frightening !!!<---A>Joseph Sweet</---A><---C>Joseph Sweet</---C><+++>The Harbingers (The damnation Chronicles # 4)</+++>", "Title": "The Harbingers (The damnation Chronicles # 4)"},
