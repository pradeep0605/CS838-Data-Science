I thought Faythe would grow as a person, a woman and a werecat and learn some valuable lessons that would lead to making more educated decisions for the <+++>Pride</+++> and for herself. But I can now most definitely predict the outcome and I hate it. Note: I also confirmed my suspicions by glancing at spoilers - not to worry as I won't put myself through finishing this series. Other people's reviews seem to suggest that Faythe is a rather disliked heroine because she's bossy, stubborn and often makes rash decisions. However, these were the main reasons why I got into this series and why,<---M> for me</---M>, it stood out so much from the massive amount of urban fantasy novels available that have a heroine that fits so perfectly into a pre-defined mold. I loved the fact that Faythe had enough about her to stand up to all the men who were fighting for control of her and I hate that the author seems to be going down the route of \"the moral of this story is... don't think for yourself if you're a female werecat\". I wanted the series to be a lesson in how Faythe could stand up and make her own decisions, even if they go against the wishes of her father and/or boyfriend. Though it seems that every time she finally took matters into her own hands, everything went wrong and she was left looking like a stupid girl who didn't do what the big men said. Oh, and honestly, I can't fathom how anyone could see Marc as a decent love interest and the right choice for Faythe. He is nothing but an uptight, violent control-freak. I was taking part in a conversation on one of my group forums about this series and heard Marc described as 'intense'... so apparently his erratic behaviour is what turns people on. I don't know but I do know I could never be with someone who has to make a show of 'dominating' me to prove himself, and I mean in a Pride \"you must obey me\" kinda way and not in a kinky way. His open disregard for what Faythe wants and the way he turns his nose up at her desire for indepedence just makes my blood boil in fury. And I wouldn't even mind if she didn't have a yummy, kind, sexy and funny alternative that would do just about anything for her. You see, I've read reviews where people say they love Marc and hate Jace. Now, how can you hate Jace? He's all kinds of fun. If you haven't read this series and are now forming some opinion that Marc must be the sexy bad boy and Jace must be the nice guy and I'm the kind of girl who has a feminist rant at the dangers of the bad boy stereotpye...<---F> you couldn't be more wrong</---F>. Here's how I see these two candidates for Faythe's heart: Marc - uptight, violent, controlling, \"intense\", plays by the Pride rules. Jace - funny, sexy, actually cares what Faythe wants not what she should do according to werecat rules, a rulebreaker. Anyone here ever watch Buffy (if not, go here now and do nothing else until you've finished it!)? Well, Marc reminds me of a more violent version of Angel and Jace reminds me of Spike *swoons like a fangirl* . I like 'bad boys', those who are wild and disregard the rules... and I like them to be fun too. Marc's a square and the realisation that the author has super, never-ending love planned for him and Faythe is what made me reluctant to read on. Too bad, Faythe and Jace would have been worth over-looking the silly love triangle thing for. ...more I know, I know, a lot of you really don\u2019t like Faythe. After all, she is impulsive, is known to run off at the mouth, and sometimes she does incredibly stupid things. But I like Faythe. I like how her character grows and matures with each subsequent book. Yes, she still is impulsive. Yes, she still lacks a good brain filter. However, she is beginning to understand that her actions have consequences not only to herself, but to her Pride as a whole.

After all, she is impulsive, is known to run off at the mouth, and sometimes she does incredibly stupid things. But I like Faythe. I like how her character grows and matures with each subsequent book. Yes, she still is impulsive. Yes, she still lacks a good brain filter. However, she is beginning to understand that her actions have consequences not only to herself, but to her Pride as a whole. Pride starts off with Faythe facing the consequences of an accidental creation of a stray and his death. She is brought before the council tribunal, a kind of werecat kangaroo court. In werecat law, a defendant is always presumed guilty and must prove their innocence. The tribunal is not going well and Faythe comes to the slow realization that her life hangs in the balance and that the council wants to execute her for her actions should she not prove herself useful to them. The tribunal does not go smoothly. There are many interruptions. The local Bruin Keller barges in to tell the cats to stay off of his territory. The tribunal stops so that the werecats can investigate. They realize that a group of strays are wreaking havoc in the area and attacking humans, a big no-no in the werecat world. Keller also captures and drops off a female cat. Enter the mysterious teenage tabby, Kaci. As the tribunal continues, there are further interruptions. It becomes apparent that the tribunal was just a way for one of the Alphas to jockey for position and to possibly enlarge his Pride. The werecat politicking and maneuvering was especially devious. I did not like some of the tribunal council members at all. And Marc. Oh I felt so sad for him. I\u2019ll leave it at that. I must say that I truly love Faythe\u2019s father Greg. He is one of those gifted politicians and he plays the game very well. He is able to see the big picture. I am very interested to see what transpires in the next book. There was lots of action, lots of injuries, and lots of fur flying in this book. I can\u2019t wait to read the next book. ...more There must be some hidden, golden rule somewhere that I tend to fall more in love with Urban Fantasy series by the third book. I don't know what it is - maybe the writer is in the middle of getting the story even better, or else I've just fallen in love more with the characters? Have no idea, only in this one I do know it's not because I love the main character. I actually loathe her. I was hoping that, by this point in the series, she would have evolved, calmed down, and grew up a little.

Have no idea, only in this one I do know it's not because I love the main character. I actually loathe her. I was hoping that, by this point in the series, she would have evolved, calmed down, and grew up a little. Instead she's still abrasive and makes me cringe at some of what she says and how silly she is in predicaments, but it was toned down a little this time. Marc is more likeable now, although I always liked him a decent bit. The mother and Manx aren't really in this one as the book takes place in a neutral meeting place for the shifter council. They were missed but we get lots of the father, who I always dug, and the brothers, who are fun. I'm not usually into shifter internal politics, but the maneuvering here was actually interesting. There is a big change in the status of two of the main characters, so there is a small cliffhanger with that at the end. There's a lot of talking in this one compared to the action of others, but it works and pacing doesn't lag somehow. <---A>Rachel Vincent</---A> has a creative way with words and dialogue that works. It's easy to envision the characters you're reading about. Their motivations are clear without needing spelled out. She must like the main character herself, and I know some other readers do, but for me she's the only downfall of the story. I'm curious about the next book, as it's clear there's a lot of changes in store and potential dangers to the family, not just Faith herself. ...more Kesin olan bir \u015fey varsa o da \u015fu Rachel her bir kitab\u0131nda giderek daha iyi oluyor.

Add to the mix several attacks to Faythe by the strays while she's trying to help and she doesn't know what to do with Marc after their relationship has changed in the previous book. It's definitely one roller coaster ride after another in this latest installment. These books seem to get progressively better and better.

I already reviewed this properly HERE but I think I'm enjoying it even more the second time around :o) So, far this is actually my favorite in the series! I liked how the plot wasn't all about a mystery/crime, so it had a different feel from the first two books.

I really like Faythe as a heroine, I feel like I can relate to her. The plot was a bit slow in the beginning but as soon as they found Kaci and things started happening, I flew through this. The ending was sad, in spite of me not being a huge Marc lover. I'm really looking forward to starting book 4 next month. Best book in the series yet! Lots of actions! Loved everything that was going on. Faythe is one smart tabby. And now it looks like Kaci will be following in her footsteps. I have a feeling Faythe can figure a way around anything! And maybe Marc and her will finally settle down. ha! Bu di\u011fer iki kitaba g\u00f6re daha derinlemesine ve karakter analizleriyle dolu bir kitapt\u0131.

There was tons of action and a whole lot of \"shake-up\" regarding relationships among Prides nationally within the Territorial Council. I totally hate Calvin Malone--what a bastard, I hope he gets what's coming to him. So many story lines feathering off throughout this series--as in the previous book, they have discovered a new tabby and she has severa This is my favorite so far in the series--I might say the same about the next book too...So much happened in this installment--what a page turner.

So many story lines feathering off throughout this series--as in the previous book, they have discovered a new tabby and she has several secrets and mysteries they have to uncover. Not to mention Faythes many troubles with the Council. Trouble seems to find Faythe wherever she goes--and I do mean everywhere. She's like a magnet for everything dangerous and menacing. I love how her relationship has grown with her father. They seem to share a mutual respect more so now than ever and they both are doing a better job at showing their feelings. Ahhhhh!!! Marc! I know he loves Faythe, but I wish he would just put his foot down to save himself some anguish. I guess if he wasnt getting in trouble with the Alphas, he would be in trouble with Faythe and I am not sure which is worse. :-) Looking forward to the next one--loving this series. \u2733\u2733 Reviewed on I \u2665 Bookie Nookie Reviews ___________________________________________________ If you like this type of book, you might enjoy one of these groups.

I feel like I waited so long for this book to come out and I expected more. I wanted things resolved, or at least beginning to resolve themselves. But it seemed Rachel Vincent decided she'd rather show you the possibilities of what could happen (for example, between Marc and Faythe) and then just yank it away. I felt like this book was just a set up book. It's purpose was to create a situation (I won't go into details) and allow certain things to happen to ensure she could continue the storyline into the next book which comes out in July of this year..

As a rare female, (Tabbie), in the Pride, her duty is to marry a strong Alpha to succeed her father and then breed. Or so she thinks but her father has other plans. Because of her rejection of the traditional role of Tabbie, Faythe has convinced her father to let her go to college however attacks on other Pride Tabbies forces her father to send his top enforcer to bring her home after five years. This enforcer also happens to be an ex-boyfriend. To put it simply. Needless to say she acts like a spoiled brat for much of the first book and I wasn't sure how I felt about the series. Then Rachel Vincent proceeded to kick my ass. This story, this world and these characters come alive at the end of book one like no other first-in-series has done for me. I was blown away at how involved it gets and at the end of the book I was already buying number two from Amazon. If I thought that this series was getting good in book one, I was sorely mistaken because book two was freaking INTENSE! There was so much FUBAR going on you had no clue how it was gonna work out and at the end of book three, all my previous beliefs of how PNR should go were gone. Rachel Vincent takes no prisoners. This isn't your average paranormal love story and if warm fuzzies is what you want do not pick this up. As I mentioned, I am now on four and I am so invested in this story and it's characters that sometimes I actually want to scream in frustration at the author when things don't go the way I expect them to. So far this series has made me cry, cuss, throw crap and laugh. Rachel Vincent has definately become a favorite in PNR and I fear she has spoiled me. ...more The review for this book will include major spoilers for anyone who hasn't yet read the first 2 books Stray & Rogue so please don't read any further if you're new to the series.

The end of the last book saw Faythe kill her ex-boyfriend Andrew in self defense, this is the same ex-boyfriend who she had accidentally infected with her ability to partially shift. Now she is on trial for both of these crimes and if she is found guilty she will be facing the death penalty. As far as the council is concerned she is guilty until she can prove her innocence and unless she can convince them that she infected Andrew by accident she is going to be in serious trouble. Considering she is the only werecat in history who claims to be able to do a partial shift, and all the witnesses she has have good reason to lie for her, she is going to have to show the council that it can be done. She has yet to learn how to do this on command though, so is finding it difficult to demonstrate the ability. The trial is being held on neutral territory & 2 of the 3 alpha judges seem determined to push for the death penalty. It soon becomes clear that there is more to this than their first seemed and they are using the situation against Faythe's father for political reasons. While the trial is ongoing they soon become aware of strays causing problems in the area. 2 humans are missing and they need to solve the mystery before the human search parties find them. There is so much going on in this book that I just couldn't put it down! Rachel Vincent is an expert at complex plots and it is impossible to guess everything that is going to happen. I loved the developments in Faythe & Marc's relationship but was heartbroken at the situation they find themselves in at the end of the book. I am going to have to read Prey now just so I can find out what happens! Rachel Vincent has a well earned place in my favorite authors list & this series is the best one I've come across for ages. ...more Wow. This book was emotional.

I was elated to see her father finally stand up for her when she really needed someone in her corner. He finally seems to open up emotionally and I can't help but love him for it. \"My father's voice was dangerous, and so low I could barely hear it. \"Should I take your paw, too?\" The addition of Kaci made for a fascinating story even though it winded its way down a dark and disturbing path. Hannibal Lecter added to that vibe rather nicely. I have to admit that I love some Rated R gore with my books as well as my movies and I was not disappointed. Outside of Faythe's pining over what could be or should be regarding her lack of a relationship with Marc, this story actually had a different feel to it from the previous two in the series. It's not exactly what I expected and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It makes me very curious to see what will happen next. \"That's a secret,\" the stray said in a stage whisper, one hand cupped to the side of his mouth. I can't tell you, because [he] doesn't want any more men. Calls us toms. But we don't really have anyone named Tom.\" ...more Awesome!

They way she handled this poor 13 year old kitten was incredibly strong and even heart warming. I love and admire her strength to fight for what she wants and for what she thinks is right. One figure surprised me a lot in this book: her father, the alpha. He was wonderful! Full of strength but also so much love for his daughter. Whenever Faythe called him Daddy I smiled. I love their relation, always torn between Alpha orders and Fatherly advice. But both manage this switch perfectly. This book holds tons of surprised and twists and turns, I couldn't put that one down. Again, this is not for the faint heart - Faythe has to deal with real gruesome and horrible things and Mrs Vincent has a way to describe it ..Wow! Mrs Vincent indeed found a fan in my, I love her writing everything feels so real and everything she describes is easily projected into pictures in my head.

One of favorite Marc/Faythe quotes \"I want you to love me enough to stay\".........\"I'm walking away because I love you. Because Calvin Malone is after me, not you, and if I go, he'll leave you alone.\" Just another example of Marc's selfless devotion and love for Faythe. I'm pulling for their happily ever after.

Compared to the other books in this series, this one was the best. Only by a slight fraction though, because it seemed a bit ridiculous to me. I was extremely disappointed in Faythe again, but more so in this book because a kid was involved. I feel like she should have been more mommyish instead of using the kids to attain what she wanted. I also thought the whole trial aspect was just stupid, of course they aren't going to harm or kill someone as rare as Faythe. The other happenings in this book are really what saved it but again it was the same story in a different cover. I'm not sure how many more men kidnapping Faythe storylines I'm going to be able to sit through. The ending of this book is also just outlandish. I don't believe for one second that Faythe suddenly started to really love Marc or that she wanted anything permanent with him. It was more like she needed someone to anguish over and use to get attention because she's going to have to contend with more special star women now. I might continue on with this series eventually, but right now I'm going to have to pass. I'll just leave these books sitting on my shelf to collect dust.

Admittedly after the last two books, the book could literally be possessed by a serial killing ghost that tried to attack me with a claw hammer and it would still be a better book than I expected. Still, my low expectations meant I was definitely pleasantly surprised. In this book, the misogynist Alphas questioned Faythe on whether or not she intended to marry and how many kids she\u2019d have \u2013 and if she didn\u2019t have any immediate plans she was simply useless to werecat society: because what\u2019s the point of a werecat female who isn\u2019t pushing out the young \u2018uns? Honestly, I expected Faythe to grab Marc\u2019s engagement ring, suddenly become pregnant and problem solved! So, kudos, Pride for not doing this In fact, in general Pride wasn\u2019t nearly as offensively awful as the previous books, not even close. Partly this is due to the complete lack of spicy South American werecats (and general POC. You wouldn\u2019t even know Marc was Latino if you didn\u2019t know from previous books). Normally I would complain about lack of POC, but like the lack of LGBTQ characters I find myself slightly grateful simply because it means we won\u2019t have to endure he representation (though we do have a ridiculous moment where 3 people share a single bed and leave another empty because a) the 2 men won\u2019t let the other share a bed with Faythe and b) two men sharing a bed is terribad icky.) The main issues I have with this book is that it completely ignores the context of the books that have come before. Like we have Greg, Faythe\u2019s father who is pretty much cast as the Good One in this book. He is the reasonable Alpha. He is the nice Alpha. And he\u2019s just being terribly trapped by the Alpha council who is totally awful and old fashioned and misogynist. Except this completely brushes over the last two books where, if you recall, Faythe was locked in a cage for not being perfectly obedient. She was under such a level of house arrest that she worried she wouldn\u2019t be able to use the bathroom without being watched. She has been set up almost from birth to be with a certain guy and no other choice was considered. Now this guy who imposed all this on Faythe is the \u201cgood one.\u201d Just as this book Faythe spends so much time pining over Marc who rejected her last book because she wouldn\u2019t walk down the aisle with him. She is sasd, desperate to get him back and completely brushing over his violent, furniture destroying temper. And making light of him menacing other men for looking at her (remembering HE broke up with HER) \u2013 claiming he wouldn\u2019t take it too far, despite the fact in previous books he half killed a man for daring to flirt with her. We\u2019re just ignoring all that \u2013 now her saying no to him was totally a mistake she regrets And that, that right there, is why this book annoys me so much. It\u2019s not what is in this book that is the problem, it\u2019s the fact that the shifting narrative excuses or ignores what has gone before because the antagonist has shifted. Greg is the good Alpha and kind father while Malone is the misogynist ruthless arsehole and Blackwell is the old fashioned misogynist arsehole. Marc is the perfect lover Faythe was a fool to let go \u2013 not the all-but-arranged marriage she was being forced into. When we introduce Kaci (really, what is with the spelling of these names?!) it gets worse. See, Kaci, a new 13 year old female werecat all alone and vulnerable. Now, she\u2019s a child so a lot of the narrative about how she needs sheltering and protecting could relate to her age: but ultimately her situation is based far more on her being female. She is being hunted for being female. Even Faythe is outraged that her father and brothers aren\u2019t protecting her since she\u2019s female \u2013 she repeatedly makes comments about them dropping the ball with her. But the entire first book was about Faythe wanting to be free from this stifling \u201cprotection.\u201d This whole narrative, while not terrible in and of itself, serves as a complete justification for how Faythe has been treated in the first 2 books.

In the first two books, Stray and Rogue we are introduced to the werecat community, specifically to Faythe's story. Faythe is one of very few female werecats and she's in the midst of discovering an identity and purpose for herself. That identity is at odds with the usual pattern of a female werecat's life, which is to marry young and have many children. Instead Faythe attended college, then returned to take up the traditionally male role as a pride enforcer. When she's placed on trial for turning a human and then murdering him, her role and worth are called into question. I don't mind a feminist theme in urban fantasy. Even though this book is a little heavy handed about it, I enjoyed the premise of a young woman trying to prove and defend herself to a very patriarchal justice system. The entire plot centers around the trial, which means that there are more politics and talks than action and violence. This suits the underlying theme well, and makes the book a good bridge in the series. However, it does have an unnecessarily slow pace--some of the trial details could have been cut to speed things along. I find Faythe to be likeable and irritating by turns. I think the central problem is that she's 23, but acts more like a girl in her mid-teens. She's petulant, self involved, impulsive, and short sighted. It's all well and good for an author to give her lead character room to grow, but in this case Faythe borders on unlikeable. This is all balance only slightly by the fact that I wanted her to prevail because of her unique position in her society. In other words, were she not the only female of her species with a perceivable back bone and personality that stood out, I might find her truly loathsome. As it is, her behavior is only barely tolerable. This brings me to the relationships, both romantic and otherwise. Marc has to be one of the most ill treated heroes I've ever encountered. Faythe wants to be with him, but on her own terms (i.e she refuses even the most surface level commitment). Not only are they completely dysfunctional as a couple, they don't seem to work all that well as a team. Even though Marc outranks her and has more experience, Faythe doesn't listen to him and rarely obeys him. I really don't care for them as a couple. Then there's Jace, the third corner in the love triangle just waiting to happen. I despise love triangles. Unless the author handles them with the utmost grace and originality they are the cheapest of romantic conflicts. The non-romantic relationships interested me far more. Faythe's and her father don't always see eye to eye because she doesn't understand his wisdom, but her admiration for him is apparent. A new character, Kaci the teenaged tabby, is introduced. Faythe's attempts to bond with her are actually quite touching and entertaining. This is one of those books where the good elements only just manage to outweigh the bad. I still like this series well enough, but I'm not overly eager to finish it. 2.5 stars. ...more Pride goes deep into well - prides. A lot more of the werecat social structure is revealed here. I like how the author introduces new Alphas and their points of views against all things Shifters. The old and \"wizened\" Paul Blackthorne, the loyal yet unbiased Uncle Rick, and then of course, Malone - the jealous old bastard who drags Faythe's world to hell. The idea that someone who was only semi-familiar could create his own Pride from scratch-fevered strays seems ridiculous once you read Pride c Pride goes deep into well - prides.

The idea that someone who was only semi-familiar could create his own Pride from scratch-fevered strays seems ridiculous once you read Pride completely and get an idea of how a true Pride/Council run. And Bruins! Hearing about other species of weres always makes me happy because I love how truly original authors like Rachel Vincent can be.Not that I mind werewolves, but it's nice to see a change in the shapeshifting genre for once! Werebears - and badass werebears at that. The description of Keller and his mannerisms and fighting skills was something I truly loved to read. I have to say that the entire time I was reading, I was still rooting for Marc and Faythe. During the times when they were actually alone - I admit that I was literally going, \"When are you two going to have sex?\" - I just knew it was inevitable because readers know that the attraction between them is just perfect, regardless of how Faythe feels. I think a lot of readers are mentally demanding Faythe to shut up simply because Marc is so damn irresistable - because another skill of Vincent's is to just make her readers fall in love with the gorgeous young Stray who'd do anything for the love of his life. A personal trait I like about the way Rachel Vincent writes is that her characters are flawed. And I say that in a positive way because there are way too many books out there with lead characters that are too perfect - whether they're so sexy they can knock 'em dead in literal ways or if they're just \"lucky\" to get out of a sticky situation without getting hurt either physically or mentally, or because they're just \"so good.\" Characters can have certain skills but it's nice to have some who have judgment lapses or just bad aim sometimes. It makes them more likeable in my opinion - because readers are only human. There was a lot of new information to take in with this book - much more than the last two. And it's a fifty-fifty thing for me; I found that it was easy to take in and understand, but at the end of the book I was finding it more difficult to recall every event that had happened and small details that might be crucial before reading the next one, Prey. But I think the author may have done it on purpose - and at least she did it with clarity - because she was trying to introduce all these new ideas and plot sequences that would tie in with Pride's sequel. My brain was just in information overload as I tried to think about all the new things I was reading. Again, I love the subtle hints that Vincent drops about Faythe's past - like how it is suddenly revealed that Calvin Malone's son proposed her with marriage and she turned him down. Among other things, like the idea that Jace is Calvin Malone's step-son. I'm eager to find out what we find out in the next one, Prey. The way she leads it up to the plot is just wonderful - it leaves you hanging on the page. ...more I almost threw this book at the wall, but then I realized I would smash my Kobo and decided otherwise. That doesn\u2019t mean it was a bad book. Nope, on the contrary. I actually DID throw New Moon when I was reading it and personally I loved the book. Same with this one. I guess it just means that the emotion that was flowing through the book was so believable/relatable or just well written that it brought out the same emotions that Faythe had in me. Which also meant I cried. Twice. This book is fri I almost threw this book at the wall, but then I realized I would smash my Kobo and decided otherwise. That doesn\u2019t mean it was a bad book.

Which also meant I cried. Twice. This book is friggin awesome. I thought at one point that on of my favourite characters was going to die and I got angry and walked around the house shouting \u201cNo! Nope! No freakin\u2019 way!\u201d Then calmed down a bit and got right back to the book. I have experiences books (singles) that brought emotion like that out of me, but never have I experiences a series (other than maybe Twilight and The Hunger Games) that could bring it out of me in every single book. I am seriously very thankful that I started this series when all the books were published because my insides would have be tense with anticipation until the next book and then the one after that. Rachel Vincent is a genius when it comes to writing and I have no doubts that her other series and books are just as good. How can they not be with writing like this? This is officially one of my favourite series (hopefully it ends the way I want it to) and I am officially ordering her other books to get started on those sometimes soon as well. Good: Faythe: She can take out a werecat in human form with supplies from the kitchen. On top of that she is determined to get Marc back, so she gets a belly-button ring (because he said it was hot) and walks around scantily dressed. She sure knows how to use her assest. Marc: Sheer god. <---C>Marc Ramos</---C> if I could ever meet you, you wouldn\u2019t stand a chance from my pounce. This kitten is your #1 admirer. And I can\u2019t guarantee I wouldn\u2019t make you mad just to see you all riled up. Jace: I still love Jace too. Sometimes I feel back for him (most the time I do) but he is a decent guy, and I hope that everything ends up good for him. Ethan: my favourite of the Sanders boys. Just like Jace, but he loves his little sister and protects her. Sigh. Bad: Nothing. Rachel Vincent writes so well that I really wanted to punch some of the other Alphas right in the face. Overall (Writing style, story line, and general): Overall the writing was beautiful. The humour and sarcasm made me physically laugh out loud. It doesn\u2019t happen very often that I come across a book that makes my heart beat faster (in many ways) and brings tears to my eyes in the right moments. The heroine in this story is one I wouldn\u2019t mind introducing a younger audience to. Although, there are some \u201cevents\u201d in this novel not suitable for younger readers, the character of Faythe is honest, stands up for what she wants, will not be intimidated, and knows the value of honour and family. This series is one that will last the ages and forever be considered an awesome series (so far) in my books.

Addin Faythe is Both Frustrating and Fantastic, as Her Fate and the Future of Her Pride Are on the Line Werecat Tabby Faythe is on trial, accused of infecting her human ex-boyfriend Andrew and then killing him `to cover up her crime'. Turning her ex into a Stray was an accident - just a little love bite in the heat of the moment - and killing him was in self-defense, but Werecat law makes her guilty unless proven innocent and with her judges playing political games, Faythe's life is on the line. Adding to the excitement of a potential death sentence, the neutral territory chosen as the location for the Tribunal is being claimed by a man-eating pack of Strays whose actions threaten to expose to humans the existence of Werecats. Then to top it all off, an under aged traumatized tabby is found wandering the territory stuck in cat form - the rare female werecat, Kaci, is a prize sought by Strays and Pride alike. So with everything that's going on there's plenty of opportunities for the impulsive Faythe to get herself into even more trouble. Pride was a page turner. The hunt for the Strays provides plenty of action to keep the story moving, and Faythe gets to show her stuff - she's no prissy Pride princess. The trial itself isn't boring either, with all the posturing in that thread interspersed with Faythe's outbursts, and the almost insurmountable challenge of trying to prove herself innocent when she can't get them to believe the keystone of her defense - that she can do a partial shift when excited and can manifest her cat teeth without getting completely furry. I also got caught up in Faythe's frustration with Alpha Malone who disapproves of Faythe, hates the real love of Faythe's life Marc, and who takes every opportunity to weaken Faythe's Alpha father's position and is using the trial to set up for a power grab. Faythe herself is also irritating at times with her lack of self-control. She is always speaking her mind when diplomacy is needed and rushing headlong into action. She's stubborn (and still a bit spoiled). This time the neither the fact that Faythe is one of the rare werecat females, nor her father's eroding clout, is going to keep her from being tossed from the frying pan into the fire -- it will be only at great cost to her father and to Marc that she doesn't end up kitty-fricassee. Still on the whole Faythe is really great and hopefully she'll grow up in the next book now that she has had her trial by fire and she finally realizes how steep the stakes are in Malone's Alpha game. Frustration aside, I devoured Pride. After three books I've really gotten attached to the cast. I love Marc, Ethan and Jace. And with the impact of Kaci's heritage not yet known and the way that Faythe's world and Marc's future are left so unsettled, I am dying to know how things will play out when the story continues in Prey. ...more", "Title": "Pride"},
