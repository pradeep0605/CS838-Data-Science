“I’m going to keep going until I succeed — or die. Don’t think I don’t know how this might end. I’ve known it for years.” — <--->Harry Potter</--->

Most seventeen-year olds don’t view the possibility of an early death as being, well, possible. But then again, most seventeen-year olds haven’t come face-to-face with
death almost half a dozen times before their first kiss either.

In <+++>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</+++>, the seventh and final installment of the ridiculously popular Harry Potter series, <--->J.K. Rowling</---> brilliantly ties up every loose
end that she has planted over the last ten years since the very first outing of the series was published in 1997. Truly, Rowling has learned exactly what her fans want
and subsequently delivers a book that answers every <--->Potterhead’s</---> questions — and then some. 

Not only does <+++>Deathly Hallows</+++> revisit key places and characters from all of the previous six books, but Rowling even manages to make clever references to previous bits
of dialogue from her earlier books. Case in point: near the end of the first Potter book, after Hermione fails to see the magical solution to saving the trio from a
nasty patch of Devil’s Snare, <--->Harry’s</---> best mate Ron bellows “<--->HAVE YOU GONE MAD? ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT</--->?” Now, six years later, Hermione finally gets her revenge on her
red-headed friend when Ron believes that all is lost until Hermione yells to him “Are you a wizard, or what?” thus reminding Ron to use his wand to solve their problem.
Subtle references such as this are a large part of what makes Rowling’s books so enjoyable to re-read as there are always deeper meanings and additional allusions that
are often only discovered via multiple read-throughs.

Harry’s bold statement regarding his own potential death is also a prime example of how much Rowling truly wrote Harry’s last tale for her long-time fans. This line
seems to read as a secret “shout-out” to the Potterites who have also known for years that the series might not end happily ever after. The prophecy in the fifth book
revealed that “neither shall live while the other survives”, and therefore by the end of book seven either Harry or Voldemort had to die. Rowling cleverly fills her
last installment with so many twists, turns and complications, however, that it becomes practically impossible to determine which way this book is going to end. 

More than any of the other Potter books, <+++>Deathly Hallows</+++> is a true quest narrative, with the trio spending the majority of the story hunting for horcruxes and hallows
whilst evading capture by Voldemort’s Death Eaters. The multiple close-calls that all three main characters find themselves in throughout the book add to the tension
that continues to build until the predictably bloody battle at the end of the tale. The book does, after all, chronicle a brutal war, so be prepared for a lot of
killing and, consequently, a lot of tears. 

This is not to say that <+++>Deathly Hallows</+++> doesn’t offer up a great deal of laughs as well. The hilarious twins Fred and George Weasley make several appearances to ensure
that the book isn’t all doom and gloom. By far, the funniest part of the story is the secret radio show Potterwatch, anonymously hosted by former Hogwarts Quidditch
commentator Lee Jordan with special appearances from Fred, George, and ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin. Rowling perfectly mixes this blend of
humour, tragedy and adventure so that her epic-length novel never lags or drags.

To write a 607 page book that (<--->millions of die-hard fans around the world are able to devour in less than 24 hours</--->) is no mean feat, but Rowling’s farewell to the Boy Who
Lived is an incredibly gripping page-turner that will leave all Potter lovers immensely satisfied.

I was riding in a cab in Bombay recently, and a bookseller on foot approached me at a traffic light with a stack of books. I did my best not to look at the boy, but I
couldn't help it. He was waving several books in my face and something caught my eye. I thought my glance was discreet, but he saw me look.. and it was game over. The
light turned green right then and the boy starts running with the cab yelling 'Memsahib! Memsahib!'. <--->We're picking up speed</--->.. I'm so scared he's going to get his foot
runover so I grab whatever I could from my wallet and somehow get it into his hands. In return he tosses a random book at me through the window as he's getting further
& further away from the cab. I look to see what I ended up with. It was <+++>A Thousand Splendid Suns</+++>, which I was planning on buying anyways. The cab driver asked me how
much I ended up giving the boy. 'A hundred and fifty rupees,' I said, which is barely $4. The cab driver says in return, 'You paid a hundred rupees too much!'. Hardly,
I thought to myself. That boy worked his butt off. The best part is because the book is bootlegged it's full of typos and random fonts. Love it. In case I ever discuss
the book with you and my recollection of the story is completely different from what you read, you'll know why.

January 2008

Read the book on my way to Vietnam a few days ago. Loved it, although it was missing a few pages here and there :). Coincidentally, the friend I'm traveling with
brought the same book on our trip so I had access to the missing pages. (And another coincidence - our Mekong Delta guide was carrying a copy of the Kite Runner. We
were like some sort of Hosseini fanclub floating down the Mekong in our longboat...haha). I have a few thoughts on this book, I'll write them out in more detail soon.
I'm heading back to Bombay in a few days...maybe I'll run into another bookseller on foot :).
