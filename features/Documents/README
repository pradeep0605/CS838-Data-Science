Within *each* of the text files you can find the following tags to indentify the positive and negative mentions. Positive mentions are 
tagged with <+++>Positive Mention</+++> and negative mentions are tagged with <---[ACFMB]>Negative Mention</---[ACFMB]>. Many of the
negative examples are of maximum words of 7. This is because, some of the book names will be long and having 7 words in mentions is a good
negative example.

1.  <+++> Book Name             </+++> : Two marked Book Names as positive mentions. This is the entity we're trying to extract and train ML algorithms
2. <---A> Author name           </---A>: The Author name are negative mentions; These looks almost like a book name, thus a good negative example.
3. <---C> Character Name        </---C>: Marked character: Characters are the name of the characters in the book. Another good negative example.
4. <---F> Sentence              </---F>: Sentence (Between two fullstops) with words <= 7. Some of the books have long names around 7 words. Thus, this negative example servces as a good distinguisher.
5. <---M> Words within Commas   </---M>: Set of words between commas <=7 words; Another example which tries to explain something in the book, but not a book name (Genrally regarding information about a character).
6. <---B> Words within Brackets </---B>: Sentence within Brackets <= 7 words. In most of the cases, text within two brackets "(" and ")" tries to provide an alternate information regarding character or book.
