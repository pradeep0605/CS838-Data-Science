Excessively plucky female characters seem inaccurate. Some are constantly winking at the reader, as if to say, \"after graduating with my degree in women's studies, I opted to spend a few months time traveling so I could offer enlightened commentary on unenlightened times. I hope you appreciate my presence in your book!\" But, without those characters, I'd be even more annoyed (and depressed) by the frighteningly woman-unfriendly times, and probably stop reading historical fiction all together. Such was my struggle with this book. The highly independent, spirited female lead doesn't really belong in her backwards setting. On one hand, that's the point, to see how far she is ahead of her time. On the other hand, she probably would have been burned as a witch if she had actually showed up in medieval England as an autopsy specialist. (Not to mention the whole notion of \"independent female\" is pretty harshly undercut when she and a token handsome young man fall in love - he even rescues her from mortal peril! Unnecessary romance in mysteries is a literary pet peeve of mine that I needn't explore further here.) But anyway, as a mystery, this book is both typical and satisfying. You meet a bunch of suspects, investigate the crime scene, endure some twists and turns, and then find out whodunit in an action-packed climax. In the book's favor, the bloody murderer is a believable surprise, which is the best resolution to a mystery. In summary, I'd recommend this book for a plane ride where you can focus on the plot and not get bogged down in the greater implications of feminism vs. history vs. fiction. ...more I'm always looking for excellent historic fiction.

Solid 4 stars. 1171 - Adelia Aguilar is a rare thing in medieval Europe, a woman who has trained as a doctor. Her speciality is the study of corpses, a skill that must be concealed if she is to avoid accusations of witchcraft. But in Cambridge a child has been murdered, others are disappearing, and King Henry II has called upon a renowned Italian investigator to find the killer - fast.

And finish it off with the forensics of \"CSI\", and you'll have some appreciation for Ariana Franklin's remarkable achievement in \"Mistress of the Art of Death\", a fresh and inspired twist of historical fiction and crime thriller, a blockbuster of murder and mayhem told through lively, darkly humorous prose that is as educational as it is entertaining. The setting is 12th century England. King Henry II, still smarting from the Church's reaction to the murder of archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Becket, is anxious to get to the bottom of the grisly murders of four children in Cambridge. The Cambridge townspeople, steeped in superstition and New Testament legend, blame the murders on the local Jewish population, who are banished to Cambridge Castle for protection against a mob bent on retribution. The wily Henry, coming to the Jews defense not from love but for the sake of continued tax revenue from his affluent moneylenders, reaches out for help from his cousin, the King of Sicily, and Italy's renowned medical school in Salerno. In response to this request, Adelia, a talented young female doctor in \"the art of death\" - essentially the forensics of the time - is sent to assist. In a time when women barely rate above stable animals and medical treatment is limited by an overwhelmingly powerful to relics and prayer, Adelia faces not only the formidable task of tracking down a serial killer who is obviously still on the loose, but also overcoming ignorance and prejudice in cracking a case of unthinkable evil. Notwithstanding some anachronisms - some noted and others ignored - Franklin delivers her tale with the historical authority of Edward Rutherford or Bernard Cornwell, while told in dialogue as engaging as Grisham, Forsythe, or Follett at the tops of their games. I found myself glued to the top notch \"whodunit\", while at the same time captivated by the vivid period detail and political intrigue of the time. If this is not the best new fiction of 2007, it is certainly among the most original as it takes more than a few unsuspected twists in getting to a climax that is as insightful, ironic, and intelligent as it is white-knuckled. Well done, Ms. Franklin! ...more \u0396\u03c9\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9

It's a lot more fun to read a book in a group of like-minded people, ones who read on multiple levels like our brethren and sistern here on this site. Adelia Vesuvia, our sleuth, is a forensic physician in a time when I didn't know such existed. The twelfth century is a time period I find extremely fascinating. I've read a fair bit about this time, focusing on English and French history and the Crusades (those horrific events!); Catholic Church history at this time, when the schism from Eastern Orthodoxy was new and the invention of religious primacy in matters of the state was being consolidated, is also an interest of mine. This book's evocation of that time is appealing to me precisely because it's relatively new to my somewhat jaded sensibilities. Salerno as the primary focus of Western medicine is a well-trodden path; the fact that Salernitan physicians could be women is not well-trodden, and the simple IDEA of forensics in this time...! Irresistable pulls for me, the historian-who-hated-school. So I was disposed from the giddy-up to like the book. The author's execution was the primary unknown quantity for me. I am thrilled and delighted with the execution because the characters, while displaying anachronistic ideas and ideals, are quite believably constructed and supplied with plausible motivations for their divergent social attitudes. I can willingly suspend my disbelief at every turn where the story requires me to do so. That's very high praise from me! Characterization, in a series mystery, is make-or-break. Do I, the reader, like this group of people enough to continue inviting them out to dinner? (The price of a hardcover book being equivalent to the price of an entree at a tablecloth restaurant; the trade paper to an entree at Applebee's or TGIFriday's; the rack-size to a value meal at the local McDonald's; which restaurant am I willing to take these characters to?) The answer, while unique to each individual, is the source of the publisher's and author's income. It behooves all parties to the preparation and publication of a mystery to consider this. The good people at Putnam, now a tentacle of the Penguin empire, have done a very very good job of making this assessment and bringing a solid, interesting cast of regulars to my table at Le Cirque. Sir Rowley, Adelia Vesuvia's English suitor, is a fine example. He's three dimensional in his pursuit of her, not simply presented as out to get some one thing; I think of some of the characters in Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael mysteries as contrasts to this quality of characterization. We're given to understand that Sir Rowley has goals and ambitions that Adelia Vesuvia can both forward and threaten in equal measure. His ultimate place in her life, and her in his, isn't a foregone conclusion. Both characters are presented as struggling with what the other means to them on multiple planes. That's just plain good storytelling. It will keep me buying hardcovers as long as Franklin keeps doing it. The minor characters, eg Gyltha the housekeeper and Mansur the Moor, are deftly drawn as well. They don't, in contrast to many series mysteries, come across as convenient mouth-pieces for the author's needed plot developments. (*cough*PhryneFisher'sDot*cough*) Finally, the integration of real political developments like Henry II's move to take control of the Church's legal framework in his empire, is seamless enough to take a moment to recall as factual instead of created. It's necessary to move this plot forward. But it's also the historical reality. Well done, madam! Seldom achieved in fiction, still less the less-respected \"genre\" fiction that mysteries are published as. This is a four-and-a-half star recommended book.

I visited a fair few blogs that had reviewed the book, and found that the reviews were so entirely positive that I couldn't wait to get my grubby paws on the book myself. The bloggers were not wrong (thank the gods). This novel is a gloriously delicious read. Set in the Middle Ages as a medieval mystery, our protagonist has been asked to travel to Cambridge (United Kingdom) from the Middle East, to research the mystery behind a group of local children who have been tortured to death and mutilated in a similar manner to one another. Short in stature, Dr. Vesuvia Adelia Rachel Ortese Aguilar of Salerno is a strange and unlikely heroine, and a Doctor of the Dead, meaning she is a medically-qualified examiner of dead bodies. Fiesty and scientifically-minded, Dr. Aguilar has little other choice than to work undercover, considering this is medieval England where female doctors are few and far between because of society's view of women. Add to this the fact that she can apparently derive messages from the bodies of the dead and Dr Aguilar's the perfect candidate to be accused of witchcraft and set to burning. And so, under the wing of her valiant protector and old friend Simon of Naples, Dr. Aguilar acts as the servant assistant to her own Arab slave, Mansur, who plays the role of 'Doctor' to all external prying eyes. As a particularly valuable doctor's assistant, our headstrong protagonist struggles with the case of the mutilated kidlets on both a personal and professional level, and her search for the killer becomes more and more desperate, as further children are picked off by an unknown murderous beast. But could the animal be closer than she thinks? I read this book in one sitting. That in itself should alert you to how much I enjoyed this read, considering I have the attention span of a gnat when the book waives from awesomeness for longer than a few pages. And the book is 507 pages long. So, I think you'll agree - no mean feat. The reason it's such a robust dish of perverse playfulness, I believe, boils down to the expert writing. It's a perfect balance of detail and sparseness, and makes you forget that this medieval period could have been a bit boring for the casual reader of history. That's if anyone less expert had written this book. In fact, the style reminds me a bit of another little masterpiece, Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth (little?! Hah!), although Mistress of the Art of Death is less focused on lifetimes and more focused on moments. It's what makes a fast-paced story, I guess! If you like the sound of Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales with a splash of The Da Vinci Code then this book is for you. Besides being a cracker of a crime thriller, Mistress of the Art of Death is an intensely satisfying historical read too. There are so many paths this book could explore further - the persistence of a little disease called 'cholera', Jewish/Islamic/Christian fireworks, gallant knights returning from crusade, scientific enlightenment intruding on religious fervour, corrupt and ignorant priors and prioresses...the list is extensive. YES, I will admit - there are some historical follies rather than facts, but I promise you the story's entertainment will have the most uptight historian turning a blind eye to its mistakes. And as it's set in the period when mighty Plantaganet Henry II was occupying the throne, the author puts a fascinatingly rare and positive spin on the reign of a king who has only been known to history for commanding the murder of Thomas Becket, the then Archbishop of Canterbury. If you really want though, you can go barging past all this historical 'nonsense', and there's still a bloody good read to be found under the rubble. As for characterisation, Dr Aguilar herself is amazing - I don't quite understand, being a hopeless romantic myself, why I am drawn to this woman who has 'no time for love' and little time to be emotionally swayed by the horror of the children's tortured bodies. She is so far beyond the submissive sterotype of a Middle Eastern woman it seems to make perfect sense to put her into a doctor's role in the middle of the 12th century. She is fighting against prejudices that not even modern time can necessarily remedy, but of course as it is with the most admirable women of sense, strength and integrity guard inner empathy and vulnerable hope. And yes, for all the romanciphiles out there - there're a few heated moments for your imagination to enjoy. For true lovers of crime fiction, some of the twists aren't all that surprising, but it'll still keep you entertained for long enough to see if you figured out the clues correctly. If you're not into crime fiction this doubles as a fantastic historical fiction novel as well - just don't take it too seriously. If you're a fan of neither genre, I still challenge you not to enjoy this book. Yep, I gobbled this book up, and then licked each of my fingers afterwards. It's that good.

Onto the actual story: It was said in the school\u2019s mortuary that Adelia was interest in you only if you were dead. I thoroughly enjoyed Franklin\u2019s writing style, I thought her way of showing the essence of a woman struggling within herself to exist in a man's world was exquisite! The plot was interesting and compelling; if a bit slow in getting itself actually started. I quickly became invested in Adelia\u2019s struggles both as a woman and a foreigner. I bled for the murdered children and ached to figure out who the murderer was so that I could bring him/her to justice. I longed to free the Jews trapped by bigotry in the towers of the castle. And I broke for a woman pursuing a career she would never truly be able to take credit for. As I said, I thought the story ended when the killer was brought to justice (erm, is this spoilery? Probably but only in a minor way) but Franklin kept writing, and what came after was just, well, unnecessary for me. Overall, yes I DID enjoy this story but it\u2019s unlikely I will read the next in the series. Logic played no part in it; the Jews were feared because they were different and, for the townspeople, that fear and difference endowed supernatural ability. ...more I was quite captivated by this book.

The story is a page-turner as well, and the world Franklin describes is richly and accurately drawn, and manages to dispel many of the myths about medieval life that too many people have. In that respect, this book is a gem, although I do think there will be those readers who will think it's not really accurate because they haven't done enough real research about the \"real\" medieval times. I love the main character - she is a no-nonsense, outspoken, and educated intelligent woman who nevertheless understands all too well the obstacles women of her time had to face - and knows how and when to pick her battles. For those who believe this book is anachronistic and inauthentic, I'd like to add the following: It's more plausible than most people realize. Salerno WAS well-known for its medical training of women (as well as many foreigners, including Arabs and Africans, Muslim and otherwise), and the medical training was far ahead of the rest of Europe - so the medical elements in the novel were accurate. There was a famous female physician about a century before this story is set, named Trotula, who wrote two medical books about the diseases of women and their treatments that were used by male medics/physicians in order to treat their female patients more efficiently. Trotula even occupied the chair of medicine at the medical School of Salerno. Here's a link to a web page about Trotula: http://www.distinguishedwomen.com/biogra ... Franklin did her research on Salerno and women physicians, and Adelia is based loosely on women like Trotula. Actually, in 12th century England, under Henry II and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, although in no way \"friendly\" to women by our standards, women did have more relative freedom (legally and socially) than they would by the mid-1200s, when the Church became more oppressive toward women's education - and then secular laws followed suit. In the 11th and 12th centuries, especially in England and Northern France, women who chose the religious life (as well as many women of noble and royal lineage) had access to a fairly well-rounded education. Eleanor of Aquitaine in England had a great hand in that. Just thought I'd add my .02 worth about this book - which I gave 5 stars to BECAUSE it was NOT as historically anachronistic as other medieval \"mystery thrillers\" tend to be.

Well because generally I do not like crime stories, but I thought with this one I would get history too. You do. You also get a mixture of different character types, different cultures. Here is an excerpt about Cambridge, the town itself: Believing it to be her business to investigate the murderer's territory and see something of the town, she was surprised but not displeased, to find that Brother Swithin, busy with a new influx of travellers, was prepared to let her go without an escort and that, in Cambridge's teeming streets, women of all castes bustled about their business unaccompanied with faces unveiled.....The town opened itself wide like a flat flower to catch what light the english sky gave it. (page 119) Compare Cambridge to Salerno in southern Italy. I would have been happier if the story took place there, but then of course it would be a different story all together: Adelia was clawed by homesickness. Most of all for Margaret, that loving presence. But also, oh, God, for Salerno. For orange trees and sun and shade, for aqueducts, for the sea, for the sunken Roman bath in the house she shared with her foster-parents, for the mosaic floors, for trained servants, for acceptance as her position as medica, for the facilities of the school, for salads - she hadn't eaten green stuff since arriving in this God-forsaken, meat-stuffing country. Truly, I am trying to present a fair unbiased review. I am bending over backwards to point out the positive along with the negative. However, there aren't that many lines worth quoting........ The central theme is about Christian children who are being killed in Cambridge during medieval times. The year is 1170. The Jews are accused. Who else would be accused, even though they are all hiding to escape the hatred of the Christians? They are in fact imprisoned. So how can they be killing the kids? And the deaths of the children are gruesome. They are sexually assaulted. their eyelids are torn off. Not a pretty sight. But Henry II doesn't believe the Jews are guilty and he certainly doesn't want them all imprisoned because then they cannot work and pay their taxes. To him! He needs their money! The murderer must be found so the Jews can go home, back to work so they can pay taxes. And for some reason the King of Sicily is involved too. He has sent three to investigate the crime. One is a Jew, Simon. One is Muslim and then theire is the doctor who is to study the corpses and help figure out who the murderer is. This is Adelia, and she is a woman, trained in Salerno, but still a woman, when woman were not accepted as doctors! Not in England. So the premises are very interesting. So why am I bored? This one does not pull me. It neither gets me mad nor delights me. It doesn't move me at all. There is humor. Adelia is so darn headstrong; it is downright amusing. Would one have such a person in the 1100s? Of course it is possible, but not that likely. However it has taken me 137 pages to care about her, to laugh with her sometimes. You cannot help but admire her stubborness. She will find the murderer, if it is the last thing she does. So what is wrong? This reads like fiction from start to finish. No, I cannot say that since I have only read through 137 pages. From start through page 137, it reads like fiction. I do not think the style will change. You get a feel for a book right from the beginning. Rarely does that \"feeling\" change. The plot can take intersting turns but that is not the same as how the book portrays the individuals. So if you adore fiction oaver all else, this might be right up your alley. And most people are curious to know who the bad guy is. Who is the murderer? Since this isn't a true story I simply cannot get terribly involved. The story does not feel real. Now that I thik is a serious fault. I don't like short stories, and yet I loved Babette's Feast . Dog Tails: Three Humorous Short Stories for Dog Lovers had me laughing from start to finish! So why is this author incapable of making me enjoy a novel of historical crime? I try to stretch into different genre, that is why I keep trying books that are not what I usually read. You know, I like reading historical memoirs and about different cultures. I will continue to try and stretch my horizons, but not with this book. I am closing this book - leaving it unfinished. It is not for me. It might be just perfect for you. Vivez la diff\u00e9rence! I can always pick it up later and give it another try. If I continue reading it now I will just get more and more annoyed and frustrated. ...more Ugh. Can I give a book zero stars? Where do I start?

When four small children are murdered in Cambridge, one of them seemingly crucified, the townspeople turn on the Jews of the city, who flee to the sheriff's castle for protection. Henry II needs the Jews for the money they pay him in taxes and he dislikes unrest of any kind. He sends to the King of Italy for Salerno-trained investigators to solve the murderers. Due to miscommunications and the head of the medical department's unworldiness, Simon of Naples comes with a female doctor of death, not a male one. And thus it begins. When Adelia relieves Prior Geoffrey of incredible pain, he becomes her friend, supplying her with a respectable woman to live with (Adelia's own nursemaid having died on the way), a place for them to live and set up a medical establishment with Mansur to masquerade as the doctor (because women are forbidden to be doctors by the Church) and Adelia to be his assistant and translator. Together with Simon, who is Jewish, the three begin to investigate the deaths of the children, together with the help/interference of Rowley Picot, the king's tax collector. The webs are tangled and touch on the city's flesh and bone: their killer is probably a Crusader; the idea of Jews as Christ-killers and the idea of blood debt; the omnipresence of the river and fens in allowing the killer to come and go as he pleases. In all of this there is the danger if Adelia is found out, because the church will burn her as a witch. And there are other complications. Loads of `em. Plus a surly small boy, a smelly dog, the vaulting of one of the dead children to martyr status to bring money into a convent, and a king who is trying to bring the rule of law to the realm.

This is one of the best books I've read all year and I highly recommend it. The writing style is infused with a dry, caustic wit that is simply marvelous. I knew on about page three that I'd love this book, for that alone. Another thing I greatly admired was the character growth, for Adelia and the superb cast of secondary players in the novel. People changed and reacted and grew in subtle, surprising ways that were fascinating to watch unfold. The historical fiction elements were well-done, particularly a small yet intruiging couple of appearances by Henry II. This novel is part forensic mystery, part historical fiction - the forensic pieces being rather gruesome (I skimmed that) but ultimately the different pieces mesh together to create a truly fascinating story about a medieval careerwoman that resonates right down to our own time.

A combination historical fiction and crime drama, Mistress of the Art of Death is a mediocre example of both: anachronisms litter the 12th Century setting, and the detective work is adequately plotted but unexceptional and forgettable. Hundreds of weaknesses dot the text, and as such I was neither pleased nor disappointed by this book: although readable, it's not good and it's far from memorable, and I don't recommend it. There are a number of reviews that discuss the anachronisms that fill this book. I rarely read historical fiction and know little about this time period, but I still saw these inaccuracies and found them to be distracting. Adelia is intended to be a doctor before her time, whose education and perception have made her aware of things that others are far from realizing. When Adelia amazes us once or twice, she is an intelligent, compelling character; when there is a constant stream of minor miracles (boiling water, disinfecting wounds, bathing, eating salads, diagnosing cholera and obesity, using opiates as painkillers and sleep aids) the character is instead rendered foolishly impossible and the historical setting is destroyed. This is, on the whole, how Franklin writes her book: she makes attempts at various aspects--a historical setting, character creation, romance, a murder mystery--and then foils her own plans in a variety of little weaknesses and errors. No one of these foibles is huge, and even together they don't strictly ruin the book, but they do weaken it. The suspense of the mystery is mocked when the shadowy suspect is called \"it\" or the killer's face is revealed and recognized--but the killer's name is withheld until the last sentence of the chapter. The unlikely romance becomes entirely unbelievable after a mess of miscommunication and assumptions. Adelia is a forward-thinking female and an impeccable doctor despite her time period--except that viewing corpses still drives her to distraction. The villain is truly horrific, but that there is no motivation for his evil except than he is \"sick.\" Even the writing style is on the whole competent, until it is interrupted by unexplained Latin and French phrases or changes in point of view or preposition use. Despite all of these hundred little complaints, the book is not actually bad. The various aspects still function, the book is still readable and interesting, and on the whole it is competent if not wholly satisfying. In fact, if only one or two of the aspects were faulted, this book may even verge on good. After all, the premise has potential, and Adelia's (generally) rational, cool characterization makes her an unusual and compelling hero. Instead, the fact that every aspect lacks something, every aspect is somehow weak, makes this novel not good, not bad, but entirely mediocre. The strengths are perfectly balanced by these errors, and the result is a text so unmemorable that it is difficult to review--because I have no strong opinions one way or the other, and don't want to turn my thoughts to it. In a world with so many books that are worth reading and enjoying, I can't recommend one that I can barely think on two days after completing. By all means, if you want to, then do read this book. It goes swiftly and holds attention, and there is a certain amount of satisfaction in following the murder mystery to its conclusion (although even this is dampened by a too-long epilogue). It is wiser to borrow the book than buy it because it has limited reread potential. But I don't and can't recommend Mistress of the Art of Death , and ultimately I was disappointed--not because the book is poor, but because it is entirely mediocre, and left me with no redeeming factors to take away and enjoy. ...more \u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5

A historical thriller, The Mistress of the Art of Death, will rival modern day forensic medicine novels. The story combines medieval England in the 1200 century, crusader knights, questionable nuns, suspicious monks, and, a sly King Henry II, not to mention, four horribly mutilated dead children and the Jewish community that stands accused of these atrocities. The people of Cambridge believe the Jews have crucified their children in a passover rite. Then, add to this explosive situation, the main character, Adelia, a woman Italian doctor, unusual in itself considering the times, who further specializes as a mistress of the art of death, the for runner to a pathologist or forensic medical examiner. An occupation not for the faint of heart. Specializing in forensic anatomy, Adelia, works in this select area of medicine that is beyond most men, never mind a young woman, and excels. This chosen occupation is all well and good for Adelia, while working under the protection of the King of Sicily in the open minded cosmopolitan city of Salerno, a medical mecca of it's time. However, Adelia professional security is about to be altered in unforeseen ways. At the request of Henry II, who grieves for his lost income from his rich Jews, if not for the poor tortured children, The King of Sicily sends his best Master of the art of death, Adelia. However, Cambridge, England, is not forward in it's thinking, and Adelia must hide her talents, for fear of being taken as a witch. Joined in this espionage, is Simon of Naples, a top rate investigator and a Jew himself, sent to save the Jewish population of Cambridge, now holed up in the castle, in constant danger of attack from the town folk, outraged by the attacks on their children. The third party in this team is the Muslim eunuch, Mansur, Adelia's servant and protector, who becomes, to his surprise, the community doctor, to deflect the suspicions of the community from Adelia. The three setup shop as a medical team, with Mansur as Doctor and Adelia as his assistant, while investigating the many potential murders found within the small town. The number of potential suspects is startling high, and includes prominent citizens of Cambridge, making caution the byword of Adelia, Mansur and Simon. As the three willow down the suspects, Sir Rowley Picot, a former Crusader knight, friendly and attractive, pops up unexpectedly and repeatedly at the sites of investigation, inducing both suspicion and unwanted feelings within Adelia. Rowley offers frequent aid and support within this difficult investigation and soon learns of Adelia'a secret skills. Questioning Roley's motives, Adelia, normally set apart from her colleagues in Salerno and even lonelier here in England, is confused about being attracted to a potential murder suspect. Unexpected deaths and unexpected alliances add to the solid plot of a very good crime novel. Set within the historical backdrop of Cambridge, England and packed with many well sketched characters, The Mistress of the Art of Death is an Excellent who done it with class. In addition, Ariana Franklin presents a vary valid reason for Henry II argument and subsequent murder of Archbishop Thomas of Canterbury that is both surprising yet so completely sensible that the reader can not help but have one of those light bulb moments so rare in literature. The only detraction for this novel is the confusing number of characters that are thrust upon the reader within the first 30 pages. The initial flipping back and forth, to determine 'who is this again', cost Franklin the half star. But, reader be patient because once Franklin hits her stride in this book, you will be carried along in a surprisingly good top notch story. And, like all good detective stories, the ending is a complete surprise. So no peaking at the end. ...more This book is hard to rate; I think I'd give it about a 2.75.

But there are some technical issues with Mistress of the Art of Death , and more importantly, I feel like Mistress took me to darker places than I wanted to go, and didn't have enough of anything else to make it worth the trip. Everything after this is a SPOILER. Also, this is not a formal review and not up to the standards I usually hold myself to. I'm typing it impromptu in the GR window, for what it's worth, rather than hashing it out in Word. (view spoiler) [ Technical issues: Mainly head-hopping. There are enough odd point-of-view shifts in the early scenes in particular, that I actually thought briefly that it was a paranormal and Adelia could read minds. Also, Adelia is forever noticing things and then not telling the reader till later. This is annoying. Darkness: This is a book about children being murdered in the most horrific of ways. And then some other innocent people are murdered as a result. An endearing animal character meets a nasty end and fulfills its foreshadowing in the most anticlimactic way imaginable. A minor thing compared to the child murders, probably, but it felt like insult to injury. Just...way into the heart of darkness here. And I read some pretty dark stuff, but in all my favorite \"dark\" books, there's something else to keep me going. More comic relief might have done it. A better romance might have done it. More scenes of human warmth might have done it--the dancing scene was a beautiful oasis in this sea of ick. Gyltha almost did it singlehandedly. But not quite. Cleverness could have done it-- Don't Breathe a Word is also about awful things happening to kids, but the plot is so diabolically genius that some of your focus goes to that instead. Romance--for pete's sake, Adelia, why didn't you just marry him? You could have actually communicated with him about why you were hesitant to marry. You could have negotiated with him-- sure, I'll marry you as long as I can keep practicing my profession. . Anachronistic? Sure! But Adelia's already so anachronistic in so many ways (and I don't mean just by being a female doctor) that it's jarring when suddenly she can't be anachronistic enough to negotiate gender roles with the man she loves. Instead we get more drawn-out angst and then Adelia becomes exactly what she explicitly did not want to become: a bishop's mistress. But. But. The dancing scene was great. The scene where the river leads to Wandlebury Hill chilled me. So did the scene where Adelia notes that the convent looks and smells subtly wrong and then realizes why. Overall though, like I said, too far into darkness without enough to redeem it. (hide spoiler) ] ...more The story was slow getting started and excruciatingly slow wrapping up. However, the middle 250 pages or so engaged me in a fun and absorbing Medieval mystery. Another reviewer had said that this book is like CSI for the Middle Ages, and I tend to agree.

The general plot was episodic, with quick witty dialogue by a sassy female detective, and a gushy romance story laced in between. Much research went into this novel, creating a detailed history lesson about forensic science, the Crusades, and the perspectives of Jews and women during this time period. The characters were likeable and well-flushed out. However, at times, I found the point-of-view to be rather jarring-- the scene would be told from Adelia's perspective and jump into the perspective of the person she was talking to within the next sentence, then back to Adelia's again without any warning to the reader. I suppose this is characteristic of Third Person Omniscient P.O.V., however it didn't feel like it was executed properly or consistent enough to really make it work. The only other complaint is that the murderer was revealed with nearly 100 pages left to read. I'm sorry but once Shaggy and Scooby lift the mask off of poor Old Man Withers (yoinks!), I'm ready for the story to end. The tension is gone, the excitement dissolved, and my curiosity for the characters' situation is satiated knowing they are safe and sound. So I skimmed through the last 75 pages in 5 minutes or so, which more or less aimed to solidify the commentary on the (mis)treatment of women during the Middle Ages and views on religion that was prevalent throughout the rest of the book. ...more I both enjoyed and was dissappointed by this story. I'm sure this book was originally recommended to me because of the Jewish aspect but although they did provide a little (a lot less than I expected) background colour, for the most part I felt their inclusion was a Macguffin, useful in that the frequent historical Blood Libels gave the author a good excuse for gory child murder. I also found Adelia's character a little flat and distant. She kept telling me how she felt about things but I rarely I both enjoyed and was dissappointed by this story.

I also found Adelia's character a little flat and distant. She kept telling me how she felt about things but I rarely felt it myself. When there is too much tell and not enough show it begins to get repetative and at times I want to tell her 'Stop being so self-indulgent and get moving!' I know character development isn't supposed to be the raison d'etre of mysteries but it was dissapointing that while almost all of the charaters had wonderful potential the author never suceeded in letting me get to know them. I felt this most strongly with Simon. Mansur started out as a the dark, mysterious but trustworthy Moor and little changed, while Roly was a rather standard 'annoying turned charming'. The most alive and complex character seemed to be Henry II whose cameo appearances I thoroughly enjoyed.. And then when they are in the Castle and there are birthing noises in the background I was sure something dramatic was going to happen or that Adelia would intervene and introduce everyone to modern birthing methods but nothing. An anti-climax. In fact that was my general feeling with the book - it was missing a vital 10% that would have transformed it from OK to excellent. ...more Despite the authors note at the back about the importance of historical authenticity, this book didn't seem historically authentic at all. Jewish-raised, Greek foundling, Sicilian female doctor in 12th century England unmasks a serial-killing sexual deviant, hangs out with Henry II, and endears herself to everyone around (except the serial-killing sexual deviant...SPOILER!)? Wouldn't it be better to just say: I know this situation is totally implausible, but the setting is historically accurate?

I totally liked the book. It's historical, it's trashy, it's fun, it's part of a series (the second one just came out, I think). The cover blurbs (two by Diana Gabaldon) perfectly situate it. If these things sound appealing, read it. Less supernatural than the Historian, more romantic than the Alienist or In the Name of the Rose, more salacious than An Instance at the Fingerpost (and shorter) or that book about the coffee trade that I liked and can't remember the name of (it's on my Goodreads list though). The only thing that bothered me was a persistent sense from the writing that I was expected to take it seriously. I don't really know what created that effect, and you might not get it, but it kept the story at arms length for me ...more It is 1171, and four children in Cambridge have been horribly murdered.

Fun to read. Explanation of what should have been everyday sights, explained to us by having them explained to a foreigner was a nicely executed touch. But somehow I didn't enjoy it quite as much as I was expecting to. ...more This book was CSI Miami meets a 12th Century England serial pedophile murderer...it just didn't work for me. I thought the author was repetitive...I spent much of the book skimming pages. There were some very graphic imagery describing the children and the suspects...could have done without all of those, and I don't consider myself a prude. I almost didn't get this book. Rather, I almost didn't let Chris buy me this book. I wasn't sure of the present tense opening and the first person view of \"we.\" However, this is only how the book begins (and ends.)

(The author uses the modern name for clarity.) Our heroine is a female doctor, something very rare, only practiced in Salerno, and looked down upon. Even by some in Salerno. At any rate she is also a doctor of death. She examines bodies of the dead to determine how they have died. But, back to Cambridge. Awful murders are taking place. Children have gone missing only to be discovered later dead and horribly mutilated. The king demands an expert and he is sent Adeila, a very modernized woman in a very not so modern time, and Simon, a \"fixer\" or rather, a detective. We follow them and Mansur (her manservant/body guard who must pose as the doctor giving orders in Arabic) and an assorted other characters after the evidence and to a startling conclusion. Though at times the narration is in a way brief, (in someways if felt more like reading a script, and later knowledge gained I can attribute this to the author being a former reporter) it is very engaging. The deeper I got into the story the more reluctant I was to set it down. I would not call this a mystery book, although there is a mystery to be solved certainly, nor would I call it a thriller. It hangs delicately in between the two and manages to be intelligent, insightful, and while at some moments predictable, still surprising. I recommend it to anyone not scared of a little dark literature and the amusing banter between a love/hate love affair that, though it seems both reluctant and suddenly, does ensue. Also if you like to think, try and figure it out I also recommend it. Besides the evidence that they discuss in the book and is laid out for us and clearly marked \"evidence\" there are also many subtle hints that lets you play detective yourself, however the book is enjoyed both by searching it and not. In fact my only real complaint about the book is the issue of the affair. While brought upon suddenly (as the great ones always are) and with such respect! it also, sadly, is left suddenly. Though its conclusion/continuance is hinted at I was expecting something more clear from a story that otherwise ties everything up in a neat little bow around a particularly messy package and a sadly truthful message. That aside very enjoyable, I recommend it. ...more This historical mystery set in Henry II's England was the gift of a friend. Thank you, Kandice, you chose well. The central figure in the novel, Adelia Aguilar of Salerno, is a \"Mistress of the Art of Death\"--the closest thing the middle ages had to a medical examiner. And as unlikely as it might seem, a female doctor like Adelia is not a politically correct anachronism, was not unique--although she comes from perhaps the only place in the world that could have produced her. For from the 11th to This historical mystery set in Henry II's England was the gift of a friend. Thank you, Kandice, you chose well.

And as unlikely as it might seem, a female doctor like Adelia is not a politically correct anachronism, was not unique--although she comes from perhaps the only place in the world that could have produced her. For from the 11th to the 13th Century the Schola Medica Salernitana in Salerno was the most celebrated center of medical learning in the Western world--and it taught and graduated both men and women. So Adelia isn't made of whole cloth. Yes, there were and are strong women in every age and position in society. As one friend put it, making them credible is all a matter of the right context--and I think Franklin gives her that. The book is a great blend of historical fiction, mystery and romance. I think it's strongest in the first category though. The romance and mystery is satisfying enough, but I don't think by themselves would make me want to read beyond the first book. I didn't think the romance was really developed enough. But it at least is no \"insta-romance\" and after all it's not the book's focus. In terms of the mystery--well, I think the main culprit was far too obvious, far too early on. Even if there was one surprising aspect to the mystery, and one that did fit the clues. The style is strong in some respects. My one complaint was the head-hopping. This isn't really omniscient--it doesn't have the overarching narrative structure and voice for that--it just comes across as sloppy third person limited, and if the story weren't strong in other ways, that might be a dealbreaker. But I grew very fond of the characters in the course of the book, and Franklin's way with the setting was beguiling. She's great at bringing the middle ages to life in all its misogynistic, anti-Semitic, superstitious glory--but showing some of the complexity that makes it perhaps not so easy to put down as simply barbarous, with the glints of humanity here and there. Maybe at that not so different from our own age in that respect. Franklin's medieval England is as credible, and just as involving, as Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael series of mysteries. This is a series too, and I'm eager to spend more time in this world. Although, alas, it will be a brief tour. There are only four books, and since Franklin died in 2011, there will be no more of them. ...more I really enjoyed reading this book. I'm not normally a big fan of mysteries but since this book seemed so different I gave it a shot. First of all I was surprisingly pleased about the lack of descriptions of the people in the book. While there were a few adjectives here or there, you (as a reader) weren't bombarded with a complete description of every character from the tops of their heads to their toes. I was delighted to be able to use my imagination for a change. I think the only thing I knew I really enjoyed reading this book.

I was delighted to be able to use my imagination for a change. I think the only thing I knew of the main character was that she was short, blond haired, and had horrible fashion sense. Same with the other characters, you had a basic sense of hair color, height and body shape. It was fun :) Unfortunately there has been a tendency, especially with romance novels, to completely describe every stitch of clothing a character was wearing while (in my opinion) just saying that someone was well dressed would have been a suitable alternative. I just don't feel that I need a history of clothing every time I pick up a book. I also enjoyed the depth of the characters. While I didn't feel like I understood the heart and soul of each person, I felt that the thoughts and emotions of each character were perfectly given for each moment in the book. I never felt like I was guessing. I also liked how the main character stayed true throughout the book, sometimes authors like to change a character midway through a book just for a plot twist. That tends to bug me, makes me feel like I've been tricked with a bait and switch. The one thing that disappointed me about this book is that the last tiny bit of the book seemed rushed. Everything was tidied up and seemed to leave no chance of a sequel to the story (which I found out later that there is a second book). All in all though I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a nice solid book to read. The story was good, the characters interesting and the setting unique. In the mean time if you enjoy this book and would like something similar, you might try a book called Elegant Witch by Robert Neill (the English version is called Mist over Pendle). It's an older book-but of similar vein. ...more MISTRESS OF THE ART OF DEATH (Historical-Adelia Aguilar-England-1170) \u2013 Ex Franklin, Ariana (aka Diana Norman) \u2013 1st in series Bantam Press, 2007, UK Hardcover \u2013 ISBN: 9780593056493 First Sentence: Here they come. *** A child has been murdered and residents in Cambridge claim he was crucified by the Jews.

This book was judged the best researched of its year by the BBC and historian Dr. David Starkey. Happily, it is not written in Middle English and, as the author admits, some liberties were taken. Others more versed in this time than am I, may be able to find historic fault with it. I don\u2019t care. I found the history fascinating and learned even more about life in this period. The style of writing was wonderful; from that first three-word sentence, I was entranced. I loved the characters; Adelia, Simon, Mansur, Ulf, Gyltha, Prior Geoffrey, Henry II (whose voice I shall always hear as Peter O\u2019Toole\u2019s) were real to me and others became so as the story progressed. The language was a bit challenging at first, but soon became easy to read. The sights, sounds and smells of the town were described to place me within the story. The story kept me involved from beginning to end and tapped all my emotions. There is a wonderful romance which arises to warm the heart and quicken the pulse. I laughed, cried; was moved, frightened and appalled and I can\u2019t wait until the next book comes out next May. What can I say; I loved it. ...more", "Title": "Mistress of the Art of Death"},
