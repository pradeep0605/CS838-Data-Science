However, since I've already read it a few times, I feel extremely confident in skipping to the review. But first, can someone please explain to me why this book is 563 pages?! Seriously Stephen King once said, \"Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn. She's not very good.\" I couldn't agree more, Stephen. With that, we shall kick this off with a joke: Heh. This re-reading is brought to you courtesy of Project: Hindsight . I'm sorry folks. I just could not get through this shit book another time. However, since I've already read it a few times, I feel extremely confident in skipping to the review. But first, can someone please explain to me why this book is 563 pages?! Seriously, how is it possible a book with almost no plot can be so long? When I first read <+++>New Moon</+++> back in 2008, I didn't like it. In fact I'm not even sure why it had three stars because I remember being super frustrated. Even though Edward and Bella's relationship deeply disturbs my soul, Bella is so incredibly boring without him. I'm not even sure how Stephenie Meyer managed 563 pages. Truly, I'm amazed because I can sum up <+++>New Moon</+++> in one big picture: But let's get on with it, I'll go into some detail for ya. The book starts off on Bella's 18th birthday, a day she has been dreading for months only because in her mind she will be one year older than Edward. So, she makes a huge production about people not celebrating her birthday, but the Cullens ignore her and Alice plans a party. Before Edward forces her to attend they watch Romeo and Juliet (<---B>the book's supposed theme</---B>) and they have merry little conversation about Edward's contingency plans once Bella dies. Now, let's not forget they've only been dating for a few months. Yet, here they are making out and talking about killing themselves in the event of the other's death. How romantic. Don't even ask me the logic behind how they can even kiss when his teeth are supposed to be \"venom coated.\" Stephenie Meyer gives some bull shit excuse she must have learned from ass-grab 101. But I digress... Finally, they make it to the birthday party. Bella gets a paper cut and Jasper almost single-handedly ends this series on page 29. Unfortunately, to my dismay his attempt was foiled by Edward. Eddie pushes Bella out the way and she crashes into the glass plates, slashing up her arm. Pause, let's think about that scene a bit: Who's bright idea was it to have glass plates? With a human. In a room full of vampires. That drink blood. Isn't Alice psychic? Why didn't she see Bella cutting her finger on the wrapping paper? Wait, don't think about that because if you spend all your time contemplating the stupidity, we'll never get through this review. Obviously, Eddie is not happy with the events that went down at his place and Bella further irritates him by apologizing for...wait for it...being human. Bella, you know you've been hanging out with mythical creatures too much when you start thinking your humanity isn't normal. But anyway, Eddie does what any loving boyfriend would do after their girlfriend is attack by their brother: he ignores her. And because Eddie is \"Alpha Male Edward\" and Bella is \"Submissive Mary Sue Bella,\" she doesn't confront him about it. Instead, she waits for him to be ready. On the third day of ignoring her, he drags he into the words and chucks up the deuces. The exchange goes a little like this: Alpha Male Edward tells Submissive Mary Sue Bella firmly, \"No, I don't want you to come. You're no good for me.\" And she pretty much agrees realizing how much of a waste of space she is. Then Edward just pours salt all over her open wound and tells her: \"Don't do anything reckless or stupid,<---M>\" he ordered</---M>, no longer detached. \"Do you understand what I'm saying?...I'm thinking of Charlie, of course. He needs you. Take care of yourself--for him.\" I nodded helplessly. Wow. Relly? You're just going to let him order you around like that? How about you look after yourself FOR YOU first, everyone else second? Awesome Bells. Can I call you Bells? Not only do you have ZERO self-preservation skills, but also no self-confidence. Just awesome. There's only about a million or so girls looking up to you as a role model. No pressure to be a strong female character. You could have walked away from this with grace, but no, instead all your dignity flies out the window when you pull a bitch move and run after Edward through the woods. Then, she defaults back to \"Fuck my life\" mode and slips into a depression for four fucking months. I find it kind of funny her depression was longer than their actual relationship. Heh. But this wasn't just any depression, it was some serious shit. I always had nightmares now, every night. Not nightmares really, not in the plural, because it was always the same nightmare. You'd think I'd get bored after so many months, grow immune to it. Or how about this: Even my outsides looked different--my face sallow, white except for the purple circles the nightmares had left under my eyes. My eyes were dark enough against my pallid skin that--if I were beautiful and seen from a distance--I might even pass for a vampire now. Once again I find myself asking the question: Where are her parents?! Why did Charlie let this go on for FOUR months?! She should have been in counseling or something. But Meyer thinks she can just pacify readers by Renee sending a random e-mail here and there or Charlie just suggesting she seek help, only to be shot down by Bella. Fail. So much fail. All that considered, that's not even the biggest problem I have with this book. Bella soon figures out she can conjure up hallucinations of Edward if she does something reckless or suicidal. This is where Jake comes into play. Bella uses Jake (like everyone else) to get what she wants by asking him to fix up two motorcycles she found and giving her riding lessons. She figures it will be the perfect thing to help her see more of Edward. I suppose she simply forgot how big of a klutz she is and once the bikes are fixed the lessons commence. The first time she gets on she falls off and Jake (the only one with common sense) thinks they should call it a day before she gets hurt. But Bella thinks this is BK and she can have it her way, and gets back on the bike. Chick has gone batshit crazy and she promptly busts her ass. But she doesn't care because her mission was a success! She got to see and hear Edward! Her next brilliant idea is to throw herself off a cliff during high tide. The first time I read this I was secretly hoping she would drown, but the other two books already were published, so it was a hopeless wish. Oh and I almost forgot to mention the actual plot. LOL. Funny how that happens when there isn't one, huh? LOL. The She-vamp, Victoria, is scoping out the area trying to get to Bella. But her part is VERY small in this book (like the plot), so we don't really need to talk about her. I suppose the wolf pack is worth mentioning: They're pretty much a bunch of wannabe werewolves that run around with their shirts off. That's all you really need to know about them. So, finally Alice shows up in chapter 18 because she thought Bella was trying to commit suicide (close enough Alice). And through a nice little exchange of \"he said, she said\" BS, Edward is off to Italy to kill himself. This causes Bella to go into \"hero\" mode and race to Italy and save Edward. I really don't care enough to give my thoughts on the race to Italy. That entire part was rushed and anti-climatic. There isn't even a fight scene. Instead here is a timeline courtesy of Reasoning with Vampires (Thanks for the link Cait and Jen!): Anyway, they get back to good old Forks and Bella composes a vote on everyone's thoughts of her joining team undead. Edward is at a steady \"no\" along with Rosalie. But everyone else says, \"Hell yes!\" Like becoming a vampire is a party or something. Funny thing is when Bella asks Jasper he goes: And she's all: Hmm, yeah, that's not weird at all. Not the least bit creepy. In the last few pages Edward and Jake have a little pissing contest and Edward proposes to Bella. The End. Yawn. Thank God it's over. Now where's my fuckin' chocolate?

The series is addictive. And as I said previously about Stephanie Meyer, if you want to cease brain function for a few hours, she's your girl. The beginning is slow, the middle is gold, the end is lacking. The blank pages to represent months passed in zombie-depression, great idea. Now, my problem. My problem is not so much with the story as it is perhaps with the idea behind the story and thus, the author herself. It all starts with Romeo and Juliet. Stupid kids. Yes, yes, the great tragedy of love. Please note the word tragedy came before the word love. Because without the tragedy there would be no story. What would the story be otherwise? I'm not going to presume to rewrite Shakespeare (at least not for the hypothetical purposes of illustrating a point in this review). I will say, that I find it sad and unfortunate that Meyers insists on her characters not only admiring Romeo and Juliet (not the play, but the hormone-addled teenagers who committed suicide rather than take a minute to think it through), but specifically referencing the star-crossed lovers in near direct comparison to her protagonist and the lover-vamp. (Her main character also can be caught reading Jane Austen, but more on that later). My point? Impossible love is a great story. No doubt. And Meyer's characters, the human girl and the vampire (um, Buffy and Angel anyone?) are certainly in an impossible situation. Great, perfect, wonderful. The difficulty? No where to go. That's what makes Romeo and Juliet a tragedy. That's why Buffy and Angel never got back together. What choices has she left us? Either the human becomes a vampire or the vampire (in what would be a HUGE cheat) becomes human again. So? Make the human a vamp, right? Problem solved. Well, despite the flippancy with which so many of Meyer's characters approach this option, to do so would be a tragedy of sorts. Because in effect, it would be suicide, a life ended to be with the man she loves so senselessly that it makes you wonder how she could admire Jane Austen at all. Yes, Jane Austen writes about love, but take a look at \"Sense and Sensibility\". Jane Austen recognizes that love is more complex than the simple lust of it (while Romeo and Juliet barely get a chance to blink before they marry, screw and die-much like the carrion flies Romeo references. . .) Strength of character, not the sweaty passion, conquers all. Clear conscience and unerring moral fortitude conquers class-differences, social stigmas and familial disapproval. And so, they all get to live happily ever after. This is your dilemma Stephanie Meyers. You've laid the groundwork, not for a Jane Austen like happy-ending despite the odds, but a Shakespearian tragedy that will not only leave the audience sobbing, but foaming mad. Frankly, the readers of today don't want a tragedy (for the most part), they get that enough every day. They want the happy ending. I want the happy ending and what would that be in this situation? As far as I can see there is no way to have a true happy ending. Either you make a living girl a vampire. Or you pull out the deus ex machina and make the vampire a human. Neither option will be unsullied enough to be fully satisfactory. Personally, I would rather see the girl become a vampire, though I wish the character would take it a little more seriously than she has. Because my sense of fairness would be violated if the vamp miraculously becomes a human. But no matter how it ends, I fear I will be disappointed, as the endings of both books have been so thoroughly let-downs I cannot imagine the author has it in her mind to tack a new course at this point. How do I have the audacity to be so critical? Have I written a New York Times Bestseller? Two, three? Not yet. ...more This should suffice. You may have heard me rant about the previous novel Twilight. I decided to read the sequel, just to see if it will get better. Boy, was I wrong. First off, we began with Bella Swan bitching about how old she's getting, because Edward stays 17 forever, and since her birthday is coming up, she'll be one year older than her perfect lover. Um... older than him? Looks-wise, yes, but these dumbasses don't realize is that he's 100 YEARS OLDER THAN HER! WHAT THE HELL IS HE EVEN DOING IN HIGH SCHOOL IN THE You may have heard me rant about the previous novel Twilight. I decided to read the sequel, just to see if it will get better. Boy, was I wrong. First off, we began with Bella Swan bitching about how old she's getting, because Edward stays 17 forever, and since her birthday is coming up, she'll be one year older than her perfect lover. Um... older than him? Looks-wise, yes, but these dumbasses don't realize is that he's 100 YEARS OLDER THAN HER! WHAT THE HELL IS HE EVEN DOING IN HIGH SCHOOL IN THE FIRST PLACE? What really makes me annoyed with this couple was the fact they were comparing their relationship with Romeo and Juliet. It's nowhere even close to that because you two have no reason for loving each other! (On a side note, Romeo and Juliet have no reason for loving each other, but they had a lesson in the story. They die anyways) Anyways, they have a party and things get a little out of control when Bella cuts herself (unintentionally) and Jasper can't control his vampire needs. Edward realizes he needs to protect Bella, and in order to do that, he must go away with his family. In order to pull an irritating fan girlfriend off your back is to hurt them really badly. And that's what he does. Bella decides that without Edward, she has no reason to live anymore, even though she unexplainably can hear him inside her mind. What a baby. Luckily, Jacob saves her from attempted suicide as I'm guessing, and starts hanging out with her. At this point in the story, I'm starting to hate Jacob a little less and begun to eventually like him, because he's more of an original character than Edward. He makes mistakes, unlike Edward. He has more of a potential and realistic relationship with Bella. To top it all off, he's a werewolf and vampires so happen to be his worst enemy. However, things start to get more complicated in the story. When Bella figured out Edward was going to Italy to ask this vampire family to kill him because he thought Bella is dead from some misinterpretation. Being the piss off as she is, she immediately pushes Jacob aside and her developing feelings and travels to Italy to stop Edward. In the end, they're together. They don't need anyone else, only each other to survive. Fucking lunatics. I hate Edward now. He's just too unoriginal for me. Fan girls (including Bella) only love him because he's the hottest thing since ipods. They love an image of their boy dreams, but they hate the character that's actually more human than Edward, the sex god? What's the world coming to these days? I swear Jacob needs to get out of that retarded novel before Stephanie Meyer comes up with a way to make everyone have a reason to hate him. Good job, babe, good job. ...more Dear Ms. Meyer, Yours painfully (or some other adverb) The Society Of Of People Opposed To Douchebags And Their Disciples (T.S.O.P.O.T.D.A.T.D) When she was 12 me and my daughter Georgia went to see Twilight.

Skip to the party. She cuts herself and a unicorn cries, she is suddenly alone on the forest floor. Her life is over now that Edward gone. For the next hundred pages or so we enter DIARY MODE, complete with day-to-day updates on how she is truly dead inside. I found myself skimming though this sickeningly pitiful section like it was a high school biology book till I got to some substance. ENTER: JACOB (STAGE RIGHT) A more interesting character with [short term] goals and a little bit more of a personality. Still devoid of any mannerisms, as are ALL the personnel of this series, but he's at least more dynamic. I liked him, but it was painful to see that Bella really only used him for her next \"hallucination\" fix. She rambles on and on for hundreds of pages talking so much about the \"hole in her chest\" and how it burned and itched and stung and pussed and--well, showed all the good symptoms of a bad STD--that the plot seemed to vanish beneath her pained musings and constant reminders of Edward. The story continues along at the pace of a bike going uphill with square tires till--BAM--werewolves. This was nifty to me, having always liked werewolves with self-control and a purpose, but Meyer had no better way to describe them then \"exploding.\" Every werewolf exploded, all the time, over nothing. It was boring at best, and even though this is painted on the walls from the first book, and used as a tool to beat you with during the introduction of Sam and his \"cult,\" Bella is still oblivious. Once she finally realizes what\u2019s going on, she is unphased (I guess we should have expected as much) and uninterested. An interesting aside to this \"section\" of the book: They actually introduce a character that is NOT beautiful, godlike, stunning or otherwise perfect. Emily, the wife of Sam, has a horrific scar pattern stretching across her face and down her arm. \"Sucks to be her,\" we are left to assume because she is immediately dismissed as an unimportant character and forgot about; which leads me to the last \"section\" of the book. Here is where I got angry at the book. I'm not sure I've ever felt angry at a book before I read this last part. Bella is tired of waiting for her wolf-protector and decides to go cliff diving (as previously mentioned in the beginning of the book). As you might have guessed, she yet again fails miserably and nearly drowns, only to be saved yet again, but not before seeing VICTORIA--the shadowy plot device that has been loosely keeping this story together. At this time I was thinking, \"Ooooh! Finally! No more diary! We might actually have some conflict to gnaw on!\" ::anger flares:: Like a stereotypical sad-teenage-boy-that-needs-to-cut-himself-for-attention, Edward runs off to Italy to kill himself. This is where I imagine Meyer had hit writers block, and decided to get her computer chair wet again by gushing over the painfully gross relationship that Bella and Edward share. She kicks Jacob and her father aside like used rags, and jet-sets out to Italy (to an airport where apparently there is no immigrations office to herd you along for a few hours getting injected, inspected, detected, infected, neglected, selected and all kinds of crazy stuff), to save Edward. One hundred pages of overdramatic swooning and crashing and hissing leads to Bella being exposed to the ugly side of vampire-lifestyle and the ultimatum that she has to become one or die. This was boring at best, with four chapters of frustrating mushy googly eyes and epiphanies that the condescending git, Edward, loves the paper-thin floozy Bella and she settles in for a marriage and a blood stained picket fence in Meyer's dress-up-game of angles and demons. ...more oh, hai, just me here, reading new moon on my nook simple touch... this twilight craze... the books are not as bad as the haters say they are, but they are also nowhere near as good as lovers of this series believe. this installment was just kind of... bland. despite my reading it on the fine e-ink technology of the new nook. she did one thing right - one wonderful thing. i assume it is too late to actually \"spoil\" anything in the bellaverse, so i am just going to barrel ahead - but when edward le oh, hai, just me here, reading new moon on my nook simple touch... this twilight craze... the books are not as bad as the haters say they are, but they are also nowhere near as good as lovers of this series believe. this installment was just kind of... bland. despite my reading it on the fine e-ink technology of the new nook. she did one thing right - one wonderful thing. i assume it is too late to actually \"spoil\" anything in the bellaverse, so i am just going to barrel ahead - but when edward leaves bella in the woods. that moment - when she just loses her mind and her desolation and her emptiness and her self-destructive impulses shoot straight to the surface. it was pretty well-done. because let's face it, we have all been left behind by someone we are still in love with. even me. wonderful, wonderful me. and having recently rewatched my favorite movie, head-on , i have to point out the best scene in it, and how it mirrors this book. this is a spoiler for head on . which you should all watch. and be gutted.

I've heard so much about this book, and I suppose it is interesting to see what people are talking about. But, Jesus Christ, Bella is eighteen and she's already obsessing about getting old. She keeps hassling Edward to turn her into a vampire so that she can stay young and pretty for ever. There is some chance that this will result in her losing her immortal soul, but hey, seems worth the risk. I suppose future ages may consider that this says something about early 21st century Western society. You don't exactly have to overexert your mind to come up with interpretations in that direction. _____________________________________ So here's a thought that occurred to me this morning, which I'm surprised to find hasn't already been discussed to death by hardcore Twilight fans. Bella is a bright girl who gets mostly As and Bs at school, so why hasn't she stopped even for a second to consider the physics of vampires? To start with, where do they get their energy from? They don't really eat, they don't really drink, and they don't even need to breathe. Yet they're incredibly strong and fast. OK, they claim they need blood every now and then. But not, apparently, very often, and how could they possibly get this amount of energy from the occasional liter of blood? Then they're hard, \"like marble\". In fact, if they didn't claim to be vampires, would we even think of calling them that? They certainly seem to be a lot more like humanoid robots. And if you just follow up that hypothesis for a moment, several things fall into place. Their blood must surely be full of those little nanobots that are going to be the Next Big Thing. When a vampire bites a human, the nanobots get into the victim's bloodstream and start restructuring him from the inside out, replacing all the soft animal tissue with something far more durable. That no doubt includes the brain too; they probably scan it and then map the structure onto software, a trick that's been standard in SF for several decades now. No wonder the \"vampires\" can think so uncannily fast. But if your brain has been scanned, destroyed, and turned into software, are you still the same person? You can see why Edward is warning Bella that she might lose her soul. It's a bit like turning an LP into a CD, a process that several of my classical musician friends describe in exactly those words. And, going back to where we came in, where is their energy coming from? Those nanobots must have their own power source too. I must admit that I don't know what it is. The fact that \"vampires\" don't seem to need any kind of material inputs suggests it's not chemical; nuclear seems more likely. Maybe they have some kind of catalyzed cold fusion, or it could be a post-quantum force that we haven't discovered yet. After all, we're way overdue for the coming revolution in physics. Also, where did the nanobots come from, and why are \"vampires\" unhappy to be out in open sunlight? I can only see one sensible answer. They can't have been created by humans. \"Vampires\" have been around a long time, and human technology was primitive when they first appeared. They must be from elsewhere, which in practice means from another solar system. Probably they were originally created thousands of light-years from here, and have been drifting slowly on the cosmic currents for millennia. Well, if their normal habitat is deep interstellar space, no wonder they're scared of sunlight. They wouldn't normally be this close to a star; they're not designed for it at all. And here's the thing that surprised me most. In fact, the story isn't irrelevant or far-fetched. If people like Ray Kurzweil are right, it's tackling what could soon be a major issue. According to Kurzweil, the Singularity is supposed to arrive this century, and those nanobots will be a reality. Millions of people will have to make exactly the moral choice that Bella has to make in the book. Are you going to stay human, or allow yourself to be transformed into a godlike and near-immortal being, which might however not actually be you any more? It's interesting that the books are appearing when they are, and present such a compelling emotional case for allowing yourself to be infected by nanobots. If you like conspiracy theories, feel free to speculate some more here. _____________________________________ I'm doing my best to like this book. I mean, hating it would hardly be a challenge, would it? But every now and then, I get a passage like this one: I'd been broken beyond repair. But I needed Jacob now, needed him like a drug. I'd used him as a crutch for too long, and I was in deeper than I'd planned to go with anyone again. Aaarrrrgh!!! _____________________________________ Having now reached the end, I must admit that I enjoyed New Moon more than I'd expected. Of course, there are some problems, starting with the fact that Stephenie Meyer can't write to save her life. But by making it a first-person narrative told by the shy, clumsy Bella, she has found an ingenious way to get around that. Bella's endearing klutziness is just a metaphor for her even more serious problems as a writer. As she keeps telling us, every time she walks across a room she wonders if she'll trip over her feet and end up in hospital; similar remarks apply to her ability to string together an eight word declarative sentence. But she's stylistically consistent, and after a while I found myself accepting her. This just happens to be her voice, even though it's not a very good one. I also thought that she was a seriously unreliable narrator. Not about factual events; to start off with, she doesn't seem to be imaginative enough to make anything up. When it comes to telling us about her feelings, however, I found it hard to believe her, and presenting everything as a mass of regurgitated romantic clich\u00e9s is an effective way to show us how poorly she understands herself. We hear over and over again that she loves Edward, and only thinks of Jacob as a friend. But we also hear that Edward feels hard and cold to the touch. I couldn't help thinking of the wonderful scene in Mean Girls where Rachel McAdams's Cool Mom insists on giving Lindsay Lohan a silicone-enhanced hug; I'm sure that Bella often winces in just the same way when Edward hugs her, though she doesn't allow herself to notice it. In contrast, Jacob is warm and alive, and she genuinely likes holding his hand and feeling him put his arm around her. There are several scenes when she nearly kisses him, knowing full well what that will lead to. It's clear that she wants to, and the excuses she makes to herself about him just being an unsatisfactory substitute for Edward are laughably unconvincing. I found the opposition between Edward and Jacob the heart of the book, and after a while I decided that the author was presenting something interesting and essentially honest. The tricky thing is that she's subverted the vampire symbol. Usually, vampires represent the young girl's simultaneous dread and fascination in the face of sex. But Edward isn't very sexy. We're always being told that he looks like an angel, and indeed there does seem to be an angelic purity about him. I find it much more plausible that he's representing religion, and when you think of him in those terms several other things come into focus. As Richard Dawkins keeps telling us, a religion is a kind of virus, which infected parties want to spread as quickly as possible; well, vampirism is rather like that too. And Bella is very conflicted in her feelings about vampires. She loves the Cullens, \"her family\", but she is well aware that most vampires are monsters. If you're brought up in a cult-like religion, that's not a bad metaphor. All other religions are evil and wrong; your own religion is the one exception to the rule. As everyone knows, Stephenie Meyer is a committed Mormon. It doesn't seem far-fetched to claim that Bella's feelings about vampires mirror the author's feelings about her religion, which among other things is very down on premarital sex. And that's where the werewolves come in; they represent the normal sexual feelings that most young Mormon girls are taught to deny. The tension between these two conflicting attractions is what gives New Moon its undeniable force, and I found the story credible at an emotional level. I can readily believe that it's just like that to be a eighteen year old Mormon girl with a healthy sexual appetite, and I feel I understand their plight better after having read this book. Well done, Stephenie! ...more I can't even.... wow. Is anyone else completely aghast that this dreck saw a printing press not to mention became a wildly popular series? I thought I was being hard on Twilight when I criticized it for portraying a relationship so ill-advised and unhealthy and then romanticizing that relationship to young people as if people didn't already make enough bad decisions. I thought maybe now that Book 1 was done the series would take a nice turn. Enter: New Moon. Exit: Shred of decency. Were it simply a I can't even.... wow.

I thought maybe now that Book 1 was done the series would take a nice turn. Enter: New Moon. Exit: Shred of decency. Were it simply a problem of the weakly-developed characters, confused and uneven plotline, hundreds of pages of cloying depression (only to be replaced by cloying sentimentality later on), and an appalling and unsubtle parallel to Romeo and Juliet, this novel would simply be mediocre teen fare. But then we must consider the problem of Bella: whiny, needy, and sullen, blindly devoting herself to a partner that constantly patronizes, criticizes, and subjugates her only for him to leave so she can spend the next 8 months in a state of emotional vacancy so acute that she forgets everything else in her life that a girl can be happy about. Bella is only complete--and she says this herself--when her man is by her side. And apparently, according to Meyer at least, this is ok. It's ok to create a character so bereft of purpose, self-assurance, and identity that she can't live without a relationship based on nothing substantial, just beauty, lust, and exoticism. And it's ok for her to experience no emotional maturity whatsoever because in the end, her lover comes back spewing the same gushy nonsense as before while still lording it over her and flying into rages when he doesn't get his way. The only compelling character in this story was Jacob. That is... until he became a werewolf and became as cardboard and unappealing as the rest of the cast. The irrational hatred between vampires and werewolves gets played off as instinctual, but it has all the logic of bigotry, and that these characters do nothing to try overcoming it is yet another way in which they are immature and non-self-examining. Due to the audience for which this intended, I have to say that New Moon and the Twilight Saga as a whole are not just poor, they're damaging. And don't even get me started on the \"epiphany\" of p. 527. We were expected to believe Bella thought Edward had ceased to love her even though an autistic housefly could see it was nowhere near true? This book failed. Intensely. I'm sorry. ...more Bella Swan's relationship with her hot vampire boyfriend <---C>Edward Cullen</---C> is heating up when her characteristic clumsiness messes everything up again at her vampire-thrown birthday party. In typical Bella style, she gives herself a paper cut and Edward has to literally throw himself in front of her to keep her from being dinner for six hungry vampires. That's the last straw for Edward, and he and his entire family pick up and leave to prevent any more harm from coming to Bella on their tab. Bella i Bella Swan's relationship with her hot vampire boyfriend Edward Cullen is heating up when her characteristic clumsiness messes everything up again at her vampire-thrown birthday party. In typical Bella style, she gives herself a paper cut and Edward has to literally throw himself in front of her to keep her from being dinner for six hungry vampires. That's the last straw for Edward, and he and his entire family pick up and leave to prevent any more harm from coming to Bella on their tab. Bella is, of course, inconsolable, and walks through life like a lovesick zombie - until she renews her friendship with local boy Jacob Black. Jacob is a good friend - and more importantly, he helps Bella fix up two motorcycles and teaches her to ride them. Bella's friendship with Jacob - and the adrenaline rush that the motorcycles bring - sustains her, until she discovers a dangerous truth about the identity of Jacob and his friends - they are a pack of young werewolves. And even worse, they have been working to protect her from a vicious vampire who has it in for Bella. After the horrible drudge that was Twilight, New Moon was a pleasant surprise. At least, part of it was, if you can get past Bella's melodramatic, lovesick, woe-is-me-I-am-the-center-of-the-universe depression. I was actually starting to enjoy Bella's somewhat odd relationship with Jacob, and the book in general, which kind of surprised me - until Edward showed up again. Then, the writing dissolved once again to \"I love you more, shmoopy.\" \"No, I love you more.\" and I lost patience once again. That's the problem with this book. The shmoopy, syrupy, unexplainededly irritating Romeo-and-Juliet True Love that Edward and Bella share. I like Bella with Alice. I like Bella with Carlisle and Esme. I like Bella with Jacob. I can't stand Bella with Edward. And let me rephrase that. There is nothing likeable about Bella as a character - she is a complete and total MarySue. Jacob is goodhearted and clever and interesting, and I have no trouble understanding why Bella is drawn to him. But why is Jacob drawn to Bella? There seems to be no reason I can understand. And most laughable of all is Bella's desperate urge to become a vampire herself. Especially at the end, when Edward asks her to marry him first, and she balks. She's afraid of commitment, but not of being turned into a vampire so she can stay with him always? Give me a break. ...more Reviewed for THC Reviews Twilight was a grand romance which frequently left me smiling, but New Moon takes on a bittersweet, angst-filled and edgy tone in this continuing dramatic saga of teen love between a vampire and a human.

Duri Reviewed for THC Reviews Twilight was a grand romance which frequently left me smiling, but New Moon takes on a bittersweet, angst-filled and edgy tone in this continuing dramatic saga of teen love between a vampire and a human. The book gets off to a rather explosive start, but rapidly turns to heavy sorrow when Edward make a fateful decision concerning Bella's safety. Following his decision, Edward is off the canvas for about the next two-thirds of the book, as is the entire Cullen family. During this time, the story is very reminiscent of Twilight in that it moves at a languid but steady pace while extensive character and relationship development occurs. The fall-out to Bella's psyche from Edward's choice is heart-wrenching to read. Stephenie Meyer is so good at writing Bella's agony, that I felt like my own heart had been ripped to shreds. Then a newfound depth in her friendship with Jacob Black, seems to be Bella's saving grace , bringing some sense of peace to her otherwise chaotic life. Still, danger lurks everywhere, bringing a certain level of suspense to the story, which then escalates into a taut thriller when an unfortunate misunderstanding places Alice and Bella in a race against time to save Edward from certain death. With so much going on, New Moon was yet another installment in the Twilight series that was extremely difficult to put down. I can't help but continue to enjoy the characters in this series. I still like Bella very much, but I found myself wishing that she would have a little more confidence in Edward's love for her. After the beauty of their romance in Twilight , it was hard for me to understand how she couldn't, but ultimately, it seemed that her feelings of inadequacy \u2013 of not measuring up to a spectacular creature like Edward \u2013 simply got the best of her. Thankfully she did have an epiphany before the end, so hopefully will be beyond that stage by the next book. Bella also has a tendency to think of everyone else first (except when she's being reckless), which can be a very good trait, but also left me thinking that it might be nice if she took care of herself once in a while too. While Bella is still an accident-prone magnet for danger, I missed her endearing awkward clumsiness. Instead she is now living on the edge and seeking out the danger. It was also very difficult to read about her severe depression without being dragged down a bit myself. Edward is still the same thoughtful and loving hero I adored in Twilight though his absence for much of the story, left a huge hole, which was a major point of the story that I though the author conveyed magnificently. One of my favorite things about Edward is his wry, teasing sense of humor, but the tone of New Moon is so serious, it didn't allow for many of these moments to shine through. In Edward's absence, Bella develops a deep friendship with Jacob Black, who ends up being much more than she at first thought he was. Jacob also essentially becomes a second hero and the third point in a love triangle. While Bella never really feels more for Jacob than friendship or brotherly love, Jacob does fall for Bella. Jacob and Edward have very different personalities, but Jacob is such a wonderful character, I couldn't help but adore him too. While I don't think that his happily-ever-after does or should lie with Bella, I do hope he gets one eventually. These three characters have completely engrossed my attention, and I can't wait to see what develops next for them. The secondary characters were wonderful as well. It was nice to see Charlie finally taking charge and acting more like a father. Most of the Cullens didn't play very big roles in this story, with the one exception being Alice. Because of her visions, she is an intriguing character who I hope will be front and center throughout the series, as I really like her breezy manner and no-nonsense attitude. New Moon also fills in a couple of the missing pieces of her human past. Although Carlisle only appears in a couple of scenes, he also fills in some missing pieces about himself and Edward. New Moon introduces Sam Uley and a \u201cgang\u201d of Native American teens who are far more than they seem to be on the surface and who play key roles in Jacob's life. Billy, Jacob's father, is also present, but doesn't take on a particularly strong role. Readers are also introduced to the Volturi, a group of vampires who live in Italy and are basically vampire royalty. They are at once both fascinating and monstrous creatures, and unlike the Cullens are extremely dangerous, posing yet another threat to Bella's existence. Overall, I thought the story had a varied and colorful character palette. As with Twilight , New Moon did not contain any explicit elements \u2013 no sex, only a dozen or so mild profanities, and minimal violence. There is a scene though, in which a group of humans become unwitting prey for a group of blood-thirsty vampires. It does takes place in the background and is not played out explicitly, so whether or not it is disturbing for readers, would depend more on the individual's imagination and sensitivity level. I happen to have a very vivid imagination, so it did make me a tad squeamish. The story also contains several mature thematic elements, such as severe depression, discussion of and a near attempt of suicide, deliberately reckless behavior, and stealing cars (though for a good reason). There are also racial tensions between two classes of supernatural beings, which includes some derogatory name-calling. In addition, depending on the reader's point of view, it may seem that Edward and Bella's love for one another borders on obsession. Even I admit, that if these characters were real and normal, I would have been telling them to go get therapy and quick.;-) I've read enough paranormal romances though, to know that the bond that is shared by supernatural creatures and their mates is stronger, deeper and more permanent than most human bonds. It's just that in this particular story that bond gets a rather heavy treatment owing, in my opinion, to it's highly character-driven nature and emotional intensity. I still think that most mature teens should be able to handle all the complex subject matter, but all these elements would make great points of discussion for parents and educators. In spite of the serious and sometimes even depressing overtones of the narrative, I found New Moon to be yet another fascinating read. I really enjoy stories that include some sort of spiritual element, and New Moon has one in the form of an ongoing debate over whether there is an afterlife for vampires or whether they truly are the eternal damned. I love stories that make me think and there is so much more going on beneath the surface in this one (even outside the spiritual thread), that I can't seem to help pondering it even after turning the final page. New Moon has earned a place on my keeper shelf right next to it's predecessor, Twilight , and I'll be eagerly looking forward to reading Eclipse and Breaking Dawn , the final two installments in the Twilight series, as well. Ms. Meyer is also planning a re-write of Twilight from Edward's perspective titled Midnight Sun . With two-for-two, Stephenie Meyer definitely deserves a place among my favorite authors. I will be very interested in reading The Host and seeing what other tales might be created from her fertile imagination. ...more \u201cForbidden to remember, terrified to forget; it was a hard line to walk.\u201d This was sad.

And there was no more reason, for anything.\u201d I remember I was excited about the movie and I went back to reread this series over again when I was in highschool. I loved the feelings this book gave me then. I also could feel why Bella has to act like that during the moment without Edward. All in all, I still like Twilight, no matter what people say. This series is the best romantic YA I've ever read and nothing can substitute it. ...more I admit I put off reading this second book in the Twilight series, for a few reasons.

Well, I finally manned up and read New Moon this week. I can honestly say this is one of my favorite books of all time. Many bad things have been said about Ms. Meyer\u2019s writing. I don\u2019t agree with any of it. Ms. Meyer has proven to me that she can write books that I can admire and enjoy, and that I can appreciate from an artistic and literary standpoint. She brings the story to vivid life, and pulls me right into the action. She knows how to make me feel. For me, it\u2019s not a good sign when I read a book and I feel detached, bored, withdrawn. I want to be involved in a story that I read for pleasure, which is 95% of the time I spend reading. When I read Twilight, I couldn\u2019t get over the awe and joy I felt as I discovered the world of Bella Swan and Edward Cullen. The beauty of their love story. I didn\u2019t think this book could top that feeling. Surprisingly, it did. Ms. Meyer took the story that much deeper for me with New Moon. I have actually read few writers that have such a gift for illustrating and bringing emotions to live. Showing the complexity of relationships, how they all come to matter and play a part of our emotional landscape. The pain that Bella feels when Edward leaves\u2026.I felt it acutely. I felt like my heart was breaking along with Bella\u2019s. I felt angry at Edward. I was so mad I wanted to slap him. But, I also felt that same love for Edward I felt when I read Twilight. I could understand why he left, not possibly knowing that his leaving could never be the best thing for Bella. With this couple, as with my favorites in literature, you can see how mutual, how all-consuming their love for each other is. Some might call it self-destructive. But emotions don\u2019t follow the rules. Even when people try to control them, they still manifest in other ways. Especially those that are so powerful, like the love these two people shared. When it came to Bella\u2019s recovery (at least partial), I thought it was so well-written as Ms. Meyer showed Bella picking herself up from the abyss that Edward and the Cullens\u2019 departure had thrown her into. The way that Ms. Meyer showed the first four months was so beautifully evocative and yet so basic, it was that much more effective. Just each month written on a individual page. Nothing else. That\u2019s how it was for Bella. She couldn\u2019t stop living, not knowing what that would do to her parents. So she existed. Nothing more. After that, there was her developing relationship with Jacob Black. Again, there was so much skill in describing how Bella becomes friends with Jake. I love how Jake is described as Bella\u2019s sun. Her love for him that is more than just a friend, like a brother, but deeper. I know that if there was no Edward Cullen, then maybe Jake could have been Bella\u2019s true love. But in the world where Edward existed, there was no substitute. I thought that the book would be boring without Edward, but it was far from that. I found that I loved this book even though he wasn\u2019t technically there, except for his voice in Bella\u2019s head. That voice that came around to warn Bella when she was in trouble. Yet at the same time, Jake had the power to hold the pain from Edward\u2019s leaving at bay. When he would smile his sweet smile, and shine his light on Bella. Even though Jake was like a crutch that held a crippled Bella on her feet, I didn\u2019t feel like she used Jake and gave nothing in return. Her friendship also helped him. She stood up for him and cared about him, bringing something to his life as well. I love Bella as a character. She\u2019s a good person, very caring, but also stubborn as a mule. I like how she is shown to be imperfect, but more than willing to examine her actions and her motives to see if she is doing what she feels is right. Yes, Bella did some immature things, but what do humans do when they are hurting? I think that considering the circumstances she went through, I don\u2019t find fault with Bella. I think Bella might come off wrong on first glance to the casual observer. Like she is in her own little world, selfish and self-absorbed. The way I read her is what I\u2019ve seen in people in real life like Bella. She\u2019s one of those people whose capacity for love is all consuming. She has to hold herself at a distance or lose herself. Because some people don\u2019t understand how deep she commits herself to others. It totally makes sense why she falls apart when Edward leaves, and then when Jake pushes her away because of what is going on with him. The fact that I respected Bella so much is why I loved this book passionately, even though my favorite character is hardly even in the book. It also testifies to Ms. Meyer\u2019s skill at writing. Her characters keep me invested, the way they interact with each other, creating the fabric of this book, a beautifully-woven creation that sucked me in too deep to let go until I was done. I love my dad, but Charlie would be a great dad for any girl. He makes this book series special to me, just for his small parts in the books. He\u2019s adorable! Silly me. I didn\u2019t expect to enjoy Jake\u2019s story and the wolves as much as I did. I\u2019m silly because I love werewolf stories. I\u2019m silly because I was completely wrong. The wolf pack aspect was very interesting. I felt so much for Jake, how he was confused and at sea; how he truly believed that the wolf that had awakened in him made him bad. I was glad that he had Bella to help him see that the wolf was a beautiful thing, part of who he was. Part of why she loved him, and like she loved Edward even with his being a vampire, she would continue to love him, even as a wolf. I have to say that although Edward is still my favorite, I adore Jake tremendously. I could see what a special, sweet guy he was, how hard he tried to do what was right, and the control that he mustered when it was clear how much his \u2018gift\u2019 made control very difficult for him. I just love how he is described. He is like sunshine to Edward\u2019s moon. So yes, I am a Jacob fan now, and well as loving his pack brothers and Emily. Even though there is not a lot of action in this book, it still kept me riveted. I appreciated how the menace of the Volturi came off so clearly, even with very little onscreen violence. The contrast between the Cullens and the Volturi was beautifully, clearly rendered. How the Cullens had chosen the connection between them, the capacity to love over the bloodlust, even if it was terribly hard at times. This helped me to see that Edward\u2019s motives were truly good, even if they seemed foolhardy. Once that was clear, and seeing his pain, how leaving Bella had destroyed him, I couldn\u2019t stay mad at him. I love Edward way too much. I also adore the Cullens, especially Alice and Carlisle. I honestly feel that this series shows a deep kind of love that I haven\u2019t seen in all my twenty-plus years of romance reading. It\u2019s not just boy-girl romance, either. It shows a deep, powerful romantic love, but also the love of friendship, the bonds of family (not merely by blood, but by choice), and how they all come together, serving as our greatest weaknesses, but also our greatest strengths. That\u2019s the duality of human nature. Funny how I can learn this lesson from a book about vampires and werewolves, and a human girl caught between them. I can hardly describe how much I love this book! I\u2019m done trying..for now! ...more Not as good as Twilight having chosen to abandon EVERY element that made it so great but still manages to keep this book afloat with the new mystery and dangers.

I just can't believe Bella's self esteem went from feeling occasional envy and remorse due to Edward's perfection to not considering herself worthy of him and constantly reminding herself how unworthy she is- she couldn't consider him lying to her at all! Hey, Meyer, where did the observant, sarcastic Bella go that we grew to know and love? Because this spineless, pathetic shell can't be true- I thought Bella was smarter than that. I actually googled \"psychotic\" and found \"psychotic depression\", the symptoms being: suicidal thoughts (Ed's voice itself could qualify), suicide attempts (all of her attempts to hear Ed's voice), audio and or visual hallucination (Ed's voice again and her vision of him before passing out in the ocean), not feeling as you once did when well (hole in chest), aggression (well, she couldn't bring herself to be mad at Edward, even if she forgave him and understood his actions, her subconscious should still be mad), frustration (perhaps her visits to the Cullen home and meadow), and feelings of hopelessness (the entire book, from being upset to aging at the beginning to her woes of the Volturi and Jake at the end). Great, we got ourselves a crazy person (no offense to those actually afflicted with this). Sheesh Bella, get back your old spine then fix it so you can stop embarrassing teenage girls. At least Bella is now certain that Edward loves her. I know many fans were upset at Edward's scarce appearances and even more upset and even mad with Jake taking his place. Now, I like Jake, he's fun, sweet, loyal, has a temper, fixes automobiles- wait, that's- that's a personality I spy. Whodathunkit. Besides Alice and Carlisle, none of the other characters have displayed a prominent hobby that they do on a regular basis for fun rather than as part of the plot. Though not nearly as perfect as Edward, Jake offers a sorely needed element to Bella's tale: humanity. Jake is a human with all its flaws and gifts- he jokes, he mocks, he fixes motorcycles, he fears, and he loves. Of course is not only human. I just don't understand why he loves Bella, Meyer actually gives a brief second person POV to help us better understand Jake, the only thing it did was make me question his love for Bella even more. She offers him nothing besides a free motorcycle. Poor Jake, forced to love Bella for the sake of plot. I suspected werewolves when Jake mentioned wolves being sacred to the Quileutes back in Twilight not too mention being Native American with the skin walker legend- it wasn't very surprising (that and I read werewolves in that copyright page). The werewolves added a very homey, nature sort of feel to the story which I enjoyed, I think I would like a tale of Native American werewolf teenage boys more than the Cullens. Though the fact that only boys are werewolves only added more fuel to my fire of \"The Twilight Saga is Misogynistic\". You can deny it all you like Stephenie Meyer but Alice nor Jane- only two pros- is enough to fight back the tides supporting this. If you're so \"anti-human\" then why are all the women so desperate, bitter, and clingy, huh? The Volturi. Now this was cool. It made the dull middle all worth it here. Aro was fun (the only one to be), Jane was too happy-to-serve-and-hurt-people-while-creepily-smiling, you know, those little girls who won't stop creepily smiling, they annoy me. Sadly, the Volturi are basically, your typical baddies who dress in black, act intimidating, and set a time line to force someone's hand and create more drama and tension. Their role as secret keepers makes them unique but... Why must the vampires remain secret from humans? Unlike your typical vampire, Meyer's are not vulnerable to ANYTHING besides another vampire and werewolves and even then they can survive that unless all parts of the torn apart vampire are burned. Why hide? Bad Meyer, she made such an interesting group yet has no good reason for them to exist. Victoria... geez, why does her desire to kill Bella for vengeance only strengthen my idea that the universe revolves around Bella? It can't be because the Cullens, James, the Volturi, Forks High, and the werewolves are all either out to get her, romantically pursue her, worship her, or protect her when she doesn't deserve it. Meyer's writing is nothing special but it made Twilight magical and actually made my heart race in the meadow; it possessed a simple and descriptive prose that definitely helped me envision the setting. New Moon's was not as magical but it was still descriptive (certainly better than the robotic Eclipse ). The pacing is also strange- Meyer merely wrote the months' names on the pages to show how detached Bella was from her \"hopeless\" life and then taking so long to tell us of her bonding with Jake. Interesting and effective but dull and slow nonetheless. My biggest gripe with New Moon is how Bella never grew as a human. She spent all her time holding onto Edward- who DUMPED her- and then clinging to Jake as a life support, then of course abandoning Jake to save her love and then clinging to him even more desperately then Jake. I can pity her but only when Edward (and the other Cullens) return does Bella return to normal. It was pathetic and sickening. Damn it Bella, you're a human girl, ACT LIKE ONE! Another grip is how New Moon turned into a love triangle (or will turn since that action takes place in the sequel). Meyer has stated that Twilight was meant to be a stand alone novel and it certainly shows. We came for Bella and Edward and now we have this love triangle which I cannot understand. Bella becomes absolutely pathetic and whiny, Jake's love goes unexplained and serves as nothing more than like Paris in Romeo & Juliet , and Edward is seen so seldom it threw the story off balance. The werewolves provided a nature, family, real horror feel, so I enjoyed the book more than an average Edward fan. But trust me reader, it only gets worse! Prepare yourself for Eclipse which spends the majority of its incredible length too strengthening Bella and Jake and leaving Bella and Edward in the \"Too Be Developed if Ever\" category. Just stop here for nothing more than a supremely lame love triangle of inexplicable absurdities awaits you- and bad writing. ...more I am so mad right now. So. Fucking. Angry. Is this what we're supposed to be teaching our teenage daughters? Sisters? Nieces? Apparently Ms. Meyer believes that: 1. Moping for 4 straight months over a goddamned boy is okay, and you'll make people worried and your friends may stop talking to you, but hey! it's okay, because your love is so strong for this boy will eventually figure you out on its own. 2. Becoming another boy's friend solely to use him to make yourself feel better and to try and fill I am so mad right now. So. Fucking. Angry.

Moping for 4 straight months over a goddamned boy is okay, and you'll make people worried and your friends may stop talking to you, but hey! it's okay, because your love is so strong for this boy will eventually figure you out on its own. 2. Becoming another boy's friend solely to use him to make yourself feel better and to try and fill that \"void\" the other boy left, without any regard for his feelings and how your actions might affect him is definitely okay because hey! he's just a friend and even though he may see it differently, you know in your heart you'll never love him like that. Even though he doesn't know. But that's okay. Cause you know. And you'll tell him. Eventually. Okay never. 3. Hopping on a plane to another fucking continent is definitely the best decision you could make when your twoo wuv is in danger of killing himself, even though he's immortal. With no regard to your father. Who literally just came back from his friend's funeral. Nah, don't think about Dad. He's probably not that worried. Cause Daddy, I love him! 4. You're supposed to be selfish because you're in love! I'm not even going to try to explain this one. It's literally the whole book. I'm just so utterly disgusted by what I just read, and I can't believe I managed to stomach it all. Bella is so weak as a protagonist, girl, woman, character, whatever. Just the way she treats everyone is so self-centered, from her father to her friends to Jacob--it made me furious. But it's okay because \"she's in pain.\" Christ, apparently Stephenie Meyer hasn't ever been in an actual teenage relationship because almost none of this shit is enough to break someone for four months. A boy broke your heart? I'm sorry, honey, but you'll eventually get over it because you're a strong woman who doesn't fucking rely on other people for your own happiness. Get out there and make your own. Without a goddamned boy. Do you really have nothing else in your life worth living for? Really? Fuck. That. ...more So much to say about this book! Most of which I already posted in my eleventy-thousand updates, so I'll stick with the theme suggested by a friend: what is it about Bella that casts a spell over so many readers and drives so many other readers smack-dab out of their minds? I got a clue from one of my favorite lines from one of my favorite novels, Anne Tyler's Ladder of Years: \"The very thing that attracts you to someone can end up putting you off.\" That must be it, I decided: the very qualities o So much to say about this book! Most of which I already posted in my eleventy-thousand updates, so I'll stick with the theme suggested by a friend: what is it about Bella that casts a spell over so many readers and drives so many other readers smack-dab out of their minds? I got a clue from one of my favorite lines from one of my favorite novels, Anne Tyler's Ladder of Years: \"The very thing that attracts you to someone can end up putting you off.\" That must be it, I decided: the very qualities of Bella's character that make some readers love her, or at least identify with her and root for her, must be the same things that make other readers want to club her and skin her and wear her as a hat. Clearly, all I had to do was sift through Bella's personality and figure out which of her characteristics was having this effect. It didn't take long, and that was my next clue. The secret of Bella's appeal and repulsiveness is this: Bella has no discernible personality whatsoever. None. She has no hobbies, no close friends or family, no political beliefs, no artistic tendencies, no spiritual bent, no religious curiosity, no academic interests, no ideas, no ideals. She gets good grades by diligently applying herself and doing her homework rather than from any intellectual passion. She is a competent cook because the alternative is living on takeout pizza and her father's never-ending eggs and bacon. She used to live in Arizona, which she liked because the weather is hot and dry; now she lives in Forks, Washington, which she dislikes because the weather is cold and wet. She says she's a reader, but there's no evidence for it. She doesn't bother getting a library card because the local library is too small. She plans exactly one trip to a bookstore, and doesn't mind at all that she never gets there. That's it. That's all there is to her. Bella is (to paraphrase Robert Musil) the woman without qualities. She is, in other words, a perfect blank on which readers can draw any picture they choose. Readers who want to imagine themselves into the story can put themselves in Bella's shoes without any difficulty or glaring contradictions. This same utter blankness is what makes other readers (yours truly included) want to use the Twilight books as fuel for a line of alternative-energy vehicles we'd be willing to design and build by hand just so we could feel we'd made the world a better place in two ways. That said, this book is an improvement on Twilight \u2013 hence the two stars to Twilight's one. Here's what New Moon has going for it: 1. Edward is gone, Daddy, gone. For most of Eclipse, the reader is blissfully free of Edward's constant chuckling, condescending remarks, sneering observations, and alleged physical perfection. So is Bella; but unfortunately, she doesn't take this as good news. Instead, she spends her time pining for him and having even less personality than usual. When she isn't being utterly passive, she's flinging herself into dangerous situations with no thought for anyone's feelings but her own. Her monstrous self-absorption is actually rather impressive considering how little self there is for her to be absorbed in. Still, Bella sans Edward is a huge improvement, storywise. 2. Jacob's story is pretty cool. It's really a shame we all know (view spoiler) [he's a werewolf (hide spoiler) ] , because Meyer does some really good storytelling here. Jacob is afraid that some former friends of his have been sucked into a cult, and terrified that he's being targeted as the next member of the creepiness club. Even his father seems to see what's happening and approve of it. Bella is worried, but tries to reassure him. The next thing she knows, he's hanging out with the very gang he'd been so afraid of \u2013 and wants nothing to do with her, though they'd been best friends just a few days before. BWAHAHAHAHAHA. It's actually quite compelling. Unfortunately, Edward comes back, Bella feels validated in her steadfast refusal to get a life, and Jacob is kicked to the curb. The end. P.S. I've already started reading Eclipse. I'm less than 200 pages in and I can't tell you how many times I've begged to have Hitler or Stalin or Mussolini brought back to life just long enough for me to beat them to death with this book and then use it as kindling for their funeral pyre. I'm absolutely enraged at how horrifyingly stalkerish and controlling Edward is being. Any suggestions for my take on that review are most welcome, since at this point it's looking like one long scream. ...more The first thing I'll tell you is that Stephanie Meyer knows her way around lyrical prose. She finds the balance between sensual and realistic, modern day language. Unlike say, Anne Rice, who bores me to tears with her page-long sensual odes to, say, cement walls and turgid baby nipples. Meyer doesn't so much turn a phrase, no; she lays it gently on it's back and rubs it's tummy until it purrs. When I landed in Port Angeles, it was raining. I didn't see it as an omen -- just unavoidable. I'd alrea The first thing I'll tell you is that Stephanie Meyer knows her way around lyrical prose.

I didn't see it as an omen -- just unavoidable. I'd already said my goodbyes to the sun. So the first book had conflict, love and sensual embraces that can go no further. I liked it because I like Bella. She is funny and accident prone. In true Mary Sue fashion, despite her \"ordinary\" looks, every carnivorous boy within sniffing distance acts as though she bathed in meat. Edward is not my favorite character. He's gorgeous, melodramatic and just a touch creepy in the 'I lay awake all night and watch you sleep' sort. In \" New Moon \" after a horrible incident, Edward breaks up with Bella and leaves town. She collapses. I don't mean she falls down. I mean she has a total emotional breakdown.This is where my problem with the book starts. Early on, the author captures the exquisite pain of loss. At first, you ache for Bella, then you get annoyed at Bella, then you want to kill Bella. About 380 pages of ACHING EMPTINESS and HOLE IN THE HEART THAT WILL NEVER HEAL and SCREAMING NIGHTMARES OF EDWARD LEAVING, WHY GOD WHYYYYYY? It becomes interminable. I kept hoping that the book would find Bella learning that she is capable of taking care of herself without Edward and that she can be a whole person without him. It is a wasted hope. Without Edward, Bella has no more personality. She becomes a turnip. He sucks the soul out of her and turns her into vegetable matter. Bella spends most of the book angst-ing over her pain and using her friend Jacob. He is funny and they actually have fun scenes together. Sadly, she calls him her \"safe harbor\" while she pines for her pasty, Emo Romeo. She is just biding her time until the glistening, fanged wonder boy gets his head out of his ass and comes home. The readers are supposed to buy Bella and Edward as star-crossed lovers. We don't go on a journey that makes us root for their love. Superficial and jarringly automatic, he loves her smell, she loves his beauty. They don't earn their relationship and there's no REAL conflict because the author has crammed it down your throat that they are meant to be together. You never doubt that poor, besotted Bella will choose Edward because she has no identity of her own. I find this whole thing very problematic because it is a YA book. This is not a healthy book for teenagers to read. This is not for young teenagers, unless you are willing to have some real conversations about self-hood, identity and what real loving relationships are like. Oh and the \"plot twist\"... ugh. Without giving away the cliched secret of LAUREL K HAMILTON proportions, I have to say, this book was predictable. It didn't hint, it beat you upside the head. You can only be concerned that Bella's IQ is that of a bowl of Caesar salad because you figure it out 150 pages before she does. Despite my dislike, Stephanie Meyer did wow me again with more of her lyrical prose. The smile broke across his face the way the sunrise set the clouds on fire. Lovely. I still hate the book but damn that's pretty. An entire book written like that would be cliche and difficult to take seriously, but in small doses, it's incredibly effective. If Stephenie Meyer could write a book with a heroine who didn't set my teeth on edge, I'd be shouting her praises from my rooftop. ...more I read Twilight and was not that impressed by it, but went forth and grabed this one anyway, in hopes that it would be better. It wasn't. Bella keeps being completely clueless , the difference is that on this book, she spends most of her time crying around about not having Edward anymore. She rambles on and on for hundreds of pages talking so much about the \"hole in her chest\" and how it burned and itched and stung, that the plot seemed to vanish beneath her pained musings and constant reminders o I read Twilight and was not that impressed by it, but went forth and grabed this one anyway, in hopes that it would be better.

She rambles on and on for hundreds of pages talking so much about the \"hole in her chest\" and how it burned and itched and stung, that the plot seemed to vanish beneath her pained musings and constant reminders of Edward. Jacob ends up being a slightly more interesting character with goals and a little bit more of a personality. Still devoid of any mannerisms, as are ALL the personnel of this series, but he's at least more dynamic. However, the story goes on at a very slow pace until werewolves are introduced. I though sparkling vampires would be the utmost mistake that the author would make on this series, bit they weren't. I always liked werewolves a lot, but Meyer 's were boring. She had no better way to describe them than \"exploding\". Every werewolf exploded, all the time, over nothing. Once Bella finally realizes what\u2019s going on, she is like \"whatever, I still only care about Edward\". Actually, there is no need to review this anymore. This books, apparently, are all about \"how awesome it is to have a vampire boyfriend\", and is under that premise that the rest of the story goes on. In the end, one hundred pages of over dramatic swooning about how Bella misses Edward later, she is finally exposed to the ugly side of vampire-lifestyle. All things considered, I did not like this book on the slightest. The only thing that redeems it, in my opinion, are the cool scenes with the Volturi - who seem to be the ones who get closest to \"real\" vampires to this point -, at the end; but they were not enough to save this story. However, as I said on my review of Twilight, I am not anyone to say that a book should not be read. Read it, if you will, but at your own risk. ...more *BREATHE* OK...LET'S GET STARTED!

For those who have previously read my review of Twilight, you will understand and realize I am not the biggest fan of The Twilight Saga. ^^^Sorry I couldn't help myself.^^^ Anyways....let's move on... The Plot Well, that (^) pretty much explains it all . So what actually did happen in the book? Well... Jasper attacks Bella, which could have led to her death. Our Eddie freaks out and becomes the world's worst boyfriend, by leaving the girl he loves in the middle of a damn forest without any real explanation. His explanation was that he isn't human (WOW! Really?) and a load of shit about Bella being safe, and before leaving asks Bella for a favour. To make sure she doesn't do anything reckless or stupid. And Bella promises to. Now. I have a problem with that. I'm not saying Bella is not reckless or stupid...but I would be seriously offended if my boyfriend was dumping me and then asked me a favour, and then that favour turned out to be something as easy as keeping myself safe. Bella is a stupid person. No arguments. But here Edward pretty much implies she cannot fend for herself, nor can she stay out of trouble despite the fact she is nearly an adult...and has been hanging around with vampires. And then, as Edward leaves, Bella - because she is that clumsy - falls over in her attempt to go after Edward. Bella...he's ditched your damn ass. Stop acting like an idiot and running after him! She then lies there on the ground for hours... why? Because she is heart-broken.....or she has a serious anemic issue and is too weak to stand up...either way, stupid girl. ^^^^I will do that, I promise.^^^^ Moving on....to more depression. Then we have 4 FUCKING MONTHS OF BELLA JUST BEING DEPRESSED! DEPRESSED! SAD! LONELY! AND MOST OF ALL PATHETIC. ~sigh~ During this time..Charlie - her dad - does...nothing. Nothing. NOTHING! WHAT KIND OF A PARENT IS THAT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??! At this point, I think the characters of this book should be sent to a mental institution. ~breathe~ Moving on...to more weird-ass shit! She finally wakes from her weird depressing state and hangs out with a few people from school and Jacob. Jacob himself has too changed. INTO A WEREWOLF! I-I- It was quite obvious. That's all I am saying. Jacob does help her for a bit until Bella starts going crazy in the head. There is something so wrong with Bella, she is a crazy chick and judging by her actions in this book, I think she has mental problems. What were Bella's actions, you ask? Well, Bella, started pretty much trying to kill herself. Why? Because she wanted to see hallucinations of...Edward. ^^^ Obviously, there are a LOT of things wrong with Bella. For those of you who haven't yet read the book, here is THE Emotion I felt during the whole book: Then Bella nearly does kill herself. KEY WORD: NEARLY. Bella does not die. She jumps off a cliff into the freezing ocean before to see her precious Edward - except its really just a hallucination. But then Jacob saves her. Or one of the other werewolves...I can't remember. At this point in the book, I was furious . Why? Why?! WHY?!?!?!?! Why, couldn't Bella just die. Why. Why. Why..... And next time Bella feels like seeing hallucinations of Eddie: I mean...seriously, WHAT.THE.FUCK?! Girls - normal ones that is - do not commit suicide because their guy left them! No-one does! Bella is ill...and its quite sad no-one else really realizes that. Now, because Bella nearly died, Alice had a vision of Bella jumping off a cliff and that's all she saw, since her visions are blocked when Bella is around werewolves so she couldn't see that Bella was saved. When she sees this, Eddie finds out and goes to The Volturi - high-ranking vampires. Why? Because, Edward here, too believes he should die. My brain...it..I....what? So what does Bella do? She and Alice drive to Italy, where she saves Edward who was going to ... wait for it.... REVEAL HIS MAGIC SPARKLY SKIN which would reveal his nature to the humans around and get him killed by The Volturi. I mean...NO. No. NoNoNoNoNoNo.....did I mention, NOOOOOOOOO?! Anyways, Bella saves Eddie, The Volturi let them go for some damn reason and during the meeting with The Volturi it is reveal that Bella cannot be harmed by the powers of the members of the Volturi, nor can Aro (is that his name) read her mind. Like Eddie. I know why you can't read Bella's brain. She...doesn't have one. *It is actually explained in the fourth book why, but I think my explanation would have been better.* But Bella also then goes to the Cullen house (they returned) where she gets the family to vote whether she should be a vampire. The results are positive and it is agreed after graduation Bella will be a vampire...marriage is hinted at. Then they go home where they found out Jacob ratted Bella's ass out (at least he is normal) to Charlie who grounds Bella...because she went to Italy. I think there should have been a psychiatrist involved as well...just saying! I finally thought the pain of Edward and Bella was gone..till I realised there were more books which I read of course for entertainment of writing these reviews! Overall this book made me feel: And NOT in the good way. Toodlie doos! Off to read more of this SHIT! ...more ...what is there to even say? I liked about 80% of this book.

Alas, Edward comes back and INSTANTLY the novel goes from pretty decent to MOTHERFUCKING RIDICULOUS. This was definitely an improvement from the Twilight, but it's hard to say you \"liked\" a book when it ends and all you want to do is grab the main character by the neck and throw her around. Here are just a few of my problems with New Moon: 01) After realizing that the group of people she just passed by (and can now hear screaming) are being MURDERED, Bella comments, \"I knew it was stupid to react like this. Who knew how much time I had to look at this face? He was saved, and I was saved, and he could leave me as soon as we were free. To have my eyes so filled with tears that I could not see his features clearly was wasteful -- insanity.\" ...wtf? That may be the only truly SANE reaction she has to ANYTHING. People just DIED, woman! It's okay to be upset. Edward's face actually isn't more important than that. I'm convinced she is in fact mentally ill. 02) She's a shitty ass friend. 'Nough said. Jacob dun need that. 03) She'd let Edward turn her into a vampire in a heartbeat, but is afraid of what her mother would say if she MARRIED him. Uh...!??!?! I almost lost my shit reading that part. 04) Honestly, I don't know how she wasn't suicidal before she met Edward. He's her only interest. What did she do before she met him? I think they need to carry the Romeo & Juliet comparison out completely. I won't be satisfied until both of these idiots are dead and gone. I hope that's how Breaking Dawn ends, but, Lawd help me, I may have to read to find out. ...more I know a couple of things about love. I know that when you meet the truelove, you \u201cjust know\u201d because it\u2019s like you walked with that person once upon a dream. Out to dinner one time, I overheard a man at another table describing this perfectly: \u201cI was at a bar the other night,\" he said, \"and I looked across the room and suddenly noticed this girl. I felt like I had seen her before, but I couldn\u2019t think where I might have met her, so I thought I was probably in love. You know, like they say, \u2018The I know a couple of things about love.

You know, like they say, \u2018The first time I saw her, I felt like I had seen her before.\u2019 Then, while I was looking at her, my mouth started to water. So, I thought that\u2019s probably what it\u2019s like when you fall in love \u2013 your body just reacts to the other person. \"Then, I realized that she\u2019s the girl who serves me at Taco Bell.\u201d That\u2019s pretty much the story of Edward Cullen and Bella Swan as they walk on the scene in New Moon . The problem is, to continue the Taco Bell metaphor, Edward and his family are, like, ravenous fans of Mexican food. They\u2019re like high college kids. And Bella\u2019s not the girl who serves the tacos, she is the taco. You can see how that would be a problem. I also know that it\u2019s statistically proven that once a girl falls in love, if she\u2019s ever away from the boy she loves, she goes into a coma. Traditionally, this used to happen because of the evil fairy who put a spell on the girl. Nowadays, it happens because of psychology, but this all becomes an argument in semantics, and who wants to have the dark fairy/brain waves fight again? Not me. Some go with faith and some with evidence, but let\u2019s still be friends. What I\u2019m trying to say is that New Moon is an American girl reinvention of Sleeping Beauty . (Not American Girl with a capital \u2018G\u2019 \u2013 that would be way too creepy for me. This is just a vampire/warewolf story, don\u2019t worry.) It\u2019s American girl in the sense that instead of helpful, matronly fairies (so retro-Euro) our heroine in New Moon finds some smokin\u2019 hot Native American boys to keep her company while she\u2019s away from her truelove. Also, instead of baking a silly cake, they build a motorcycle \u2013 less tasty, but way more badass (in theory, if not execution). Otherwise, the stories are basically the same. They are especially similar in that the villains, not the heroes, are the stars of the show. The Bellrora (Aurella?) character is stupid, jumping off cliffs with no cliff-jumping training and climbing all through the castle to prick her finger on the only spinning-wheel needle around. You have to want to slap this girl. The villains, on the other hand, have pizzazz. Maleficent is the reason to watch Sleeping Beauty just as the Volturi are the only thing that make New Moon readable. Actually, these stories are not just read/watchable, I even really like both of them because of the villains. The major technical place where the Twilight Saga went wrong, to my mind, was in staying with the Edward/Bella love story, which was mostly drained of any blood (bah dum tsss) in the first book. The more I got to know these characters, the more I realized that I didn\u2019t much care for them in the first place, which is too bad because I would rather think I like them. It would have been easier to do so if Bella had undied in the first book, and Meyer moved on to tell the love stories of the other vamps in the Cullen club in the rest of the books. The thing I like the most about Meyer, however, is that she\u2019s not ever crafting a story, she\u2019s always just telling you what happened to her bf\u2019s in fantasy land. She is so in love with Bella and Edward that she had to continue with their story. This has its obvious downsides technically, but it also has the major upside that nothing seriously bad ever happens to a Meyer character. Drama, sure, but no real tragedy. I hope she continues with this M.O. in the future because if you know that\u2019s the kind of story you\u2019re getting into, it makes for a really relaxing read. And it comes as naturally to her as perpetual frustration does to Joss Whedon or gettin in ur revew an makin ur awgumentz does to an LOLcat. I can appreciate all of them. I really hate it when I feel that an author ruins a character\u2019s life just to prove something to the literati, and because a sad ending would be so unnatural to Meyer, I hope she doesn\u2019t sell out. So, there are these things I know about love from Disney and Stephenie Meyer (to recap: love at first sight, coma), but there are other things I don\u2019t understand about love. For example, I don\u2019t know why what I know about love would sound like a good idea to anyone. This plays out within the New Moon story in a way that is beautiful and even slightly profound, though almost certainly unintentional. The Twilight Saga is all about addiction and abstinence. Edward was unborn into his addiction to blood. Most vampires are so consumed by their desire for blood that they lose all control over their bodies when they smell it. Meyer venerates the Cullens for resisting human blood, in contrast, and clearly endorses their abstinence. Everything about Bella\u2019s passion for Edward, however, has the same markings of crazy as the vampires\u2019 blood addiction. She even loses it when he kisses her in the same way Meyer describes the vampires frenzying for blood. Without Edward, Bella basically dies. Meyer does not characterize Bella\u2019s obsession as the evil addiction that highlights the Cullens\u2019 good abstinence, though. She probably doesn\u2019t make the open distinction because it is a genuine inconsistency in the theme of the story, but I think it is less revealing of a flaw in Meyer\u2019s writing than a true contradiction in American values. Don\u2019t do drugs, kids, but when you meet your soul mate you will know because of the intoxicated feeling, and the best thing you can do is give up everything and live happily ever after. Maybe the idea is that drugs are a bad substitution for the natural high of intimacy. I\u2019m not even scare quoting \u201cintimacy\u201d because I really do think the idea I\u2019m talking about is sharing everything, not just sex. It seems to me, though, that both drugs and intimacy are a bad substitute for being an actual person. I\u2019ve had friends who successfully avoid themselves by being obsessed with weed, and I\u2019ve had friends who avoid themselves by being obsessed with their significant other. It honestly doesn\u2019t look that different to me, and both end up being at the same time extreme and boring to be around. The \u201chappily ever after\u201d message admittedly creeps me out a little bit. I appreciate how awkwardly it works out in New Moon , though. I\u2019m not going to claim that Meyer\u2019s satirical skills are what make this series a pretty wonderful satire on American culture, but nevertheless I do think it is one. I actually think it is a more successful satire for its lack of self-awareness and defenses. People react in disproportionate anger to it because of what it reinforces in our values, not because of stilted dialog and the anachronistic use of the Discman. While many of us grew up with different ideas about spirituality or politics, most of us have the commonality of knowing from Disney, our true cultural parent, that a girl sleeps until her truelove battles through the traps of evil to find her and give her love\u2019s true kiss. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad for that idea to be out there, and I think Meyer mixes it up in a nice way by having the girls save the day once this book actually starts to get good. I don\u2019t like or agree with the idea, though, and I regret most of the ways that I have let ideas like that influence my own life. I don\u2019t like the idea that these stories encourage kids to think that love should look like addiction, but I also hope that reading a story won\u2019t force kids to become co-dependent. I guess I feel about Disney, and The Saga as its awkward stepsister, like that quote Augustine is attributed with having said, \u201cThe Church is a whore, but she\u2019s my mother.\u201d It\u2019s probably possible to say that of anything deeply cultural that we struggle with but ultimately feel connected to. It has that level of, \u201cI can say what I want about my family, but you\u2019d better watch your mouth,\u201d but also an acknowledgment that we can honor our roots and disagree with them at the same time. Sleeping Beauty isn\u2019t a future that I embrace, but it is a past that I feel tender about. There is something so certain and easy about true love\u2019s kiss that it is comforting, even though ultimately I think I prefer the brutal unpredictability of life. Less anemic. I don\u2019t like for books to imitate life, though. There\u2019s enough of reality everywhere without books forcing it on us. I like for books to be action-packed, hilarious, and melodramatic. It is nice when books can achieve some kind of insight into life even if the story is far removed from reality, but I don\u2019t need that. I\u2019m happy with crazy villains and unintentional satire, but if I read this again I plan to skip the boring part where Bella is sleepwalking. Sleeping Beauty is a more successful story in that Aurora knew to find a bed with a nice canopy and leave the action to the other characters. ...more Oh yeah, and Bella is a general whiney bitch, Jacob is awesome and the movie sucked.

In harry potter all they do is fly around on brooms and kill people with magic sticks (wands) I mean, really? In Twilight , all they do is lust after each other and play baseball. I mean, really? In defence of Harry Potter , though, they also learn magic, give exams, celebrate Christmas and Halloween, deal with loss, deal with horrible teachers, plan their careers, protect the downtrodden (remember SPEW), participate in duels, watch Quidditch, play Quidditch, go to Hogsmeade, learn to make potions, and more importantly, learn of the importance of human relationships. I could go on, but I'm sure you get the gist. 12. Edward wasn't a dork. Yeah, sometimes, dorks are cute. However, Harry was a bit too dorky and I can't see why girls even liked him. No, Edward wasn't a dork. He was just an asshole paedophile who wanted to fuck a virgin. And yes, dorks are adorable (going by what I assume dorks are, anyway). My (most recent) ex is a dork...? and he is genuinely one of the best people I know. Harry was also, as you put it, dorky, but he was a good person. You see, normal girls like good people. By this point, I'm honestly wondering what the relevance of all this is in proving that Twilight is superior, because honestly, none of these points are even remotely sensible. But my momma didn't raise a quitter, so I trudge along. 13. Harry Potter is for virgin nerds. Twilight is for cool and mature people. How refreshingly mature of you! Not. *rolls eyes* Honestly, I'm definitely more mature than you are if this is the best you can come up with. 14. Hermione is a week character. Unline Bella, who struggles every day. Hermione has no problems, the only things she has are self-created. She follows Harry into his troubles. Big whoop. Even if she is teased about being a mud blood or whatever its called, she has a choice. She could quit Hogwarts or something. Bella has no choice, she is in love. I'm sorry, what? You take that back right now!!! Are you actually serious about this? Hermione Granger is an inspiration to girls everywhere. She is smart, confident, independent, kind, compassionate, and one of the most amazing fictional characters to ever bless us. She doesn't have problems that 'she's created', she knows the sacrifices that she has to make for the greater good of the people. Bella doesn't even make sacrifices for her family (except Edward, but that's mostly because she wants the big D)! She doesn't follow Harry anywhere. She chooses to help him bring order into the world. She chooses to fight evil because that's who she is, a good person. And the whole mud-blood issue that you so carelessly trivialise has a much deeper connotaion in dealing with the stigma that people face for being different. She wouldn't quit Hogwarts, she's not a quitter. Besides, we don't see her complaining, do we? To paraphrase Hagrid, NEVER. INSULT. HERMIONE. GRANGER. IN. FRONT. OF. ME. And what bullshit! Bella of course, has a choice. She's just a co-dependent mope who cannot live on her own. Love Lust vs. the greater good. Hmm...tough choice there. 15. Twilight was a best selling novel, and has a bigger fan base than Harry Potter. You know as well as I do that Harry Potter has sold more copies. This actually goes against your own argument. Oh, and Harry Potter definitely has a better and much larger fan base. In my own house, everyone from my grandmother to my second cousin once removed has read and enjoyed Harry Potter , while I'm the only one who's subjected myself to medieval torture the Twilight series. There's also this gesture . 16. Stephenie Meyer writes that the only thing that can kill a vampire is another vampire or a werewolf. Since Edward is a vampire created by Meyer, we can use her written characteristics and apply them to Harry Potter. Since Harry Potter is neither vampire nor wolf, this means that Harry Potter could not kill Edward and Edward would win. Finally, a point that makes remote sense. Okay, first of all, why would you assume that there are no werewolves in Harry Potter ? There's Remus Lupin, who is my all time favourite Harry Potter character. There are also actual evil werewolves like Fenrir Greyback who would be more than happy to kill your precious Edward. There are other vampires in Harry Potter also, but we never really pay much attention to them. I wonder why?! Alternately, because you're bringing Edward into a world created by Rowling, where all magical creatures more or less have those powers that are traditionally credited to them, a vampire may be destroyed by using methods that one would usually use to purge such undead. Think garlic, holy water, or the holy cross. Either way, you lose. 17. Twilight led to many other supernatural romances in books and tv shows. Actually, if my knowledge is to be trusted (and it is), every other vampire-related show/book/work I've come across predates Twilight . 18. Unlike Harry, nobody's thoughts are actually that deep or intellectual. I bet if any of us published our thoughts into a book, none would be great English lit; Bella's thoughts are more realistic. Harry's thoughts aren't really deep and intellectual either. Granted, he's a lot smarter than Bella; the troll in Philosopher's Stone is smarter than Bella, honestly, but he thinks just like anyone else would. Bella's thoughts are either along the lines of \"I HAZ LUSSSSST\" or \"everything sucks\". Hate to break it to ya, darling, but Bella's thoughts are insipid, and that's me putting it kindly. 19. at least all of them dosent a scar of a lightning bolt. At least all of them aren't sparkly vampires. (Also, did we read the same Harry Potter , because if my memory serves me right, only one of them, i.e., Harry has a lightning bolt scar.) 20. no witchcraft (practicing witchcraft is bad). I have come to the point of praying that these reasons have some element of sarcasm to them. Okay, let me break this down for you. It's pure fiction. Besides, if you think witchcraft is bad, shouldn't you think vampirism is bad? Seeing as how it is actually a sub culture where people bite each other and drink each other's blood? It might do you good to look into Richard Chase, aka the \"Vampire of Sacramento\", one of America's most prolific serial killers. Click here for my review of Twilight which contains points 1-10.

I already knew it would be a poorly-written romance\u2014and Meyer did not disappoint. Second, Bella, our heroine, and Edward, her prince, are separated throughout much of the novel. Though many readers were probably distressed by this turn of events, I was delighted. If they aren\u2019t near each other, Bella and Edward can\u2019t do any of their disgusting, gut-wrenching touching. Blech. In one way, though, the book is more painful than Twilight because Bella now has two admirers. And, truth be told, there is very little to admire in Bella. She is one of the weakest females in print. She spends her life moping and fainting. Why would one, let alone two, hot guys like her? (Obviously, Meyer is experiencing some wish fulfillment here.) Meyer, much like Rowling (who she is now erroneously being compared to), desperately needs a more forceful editor. New Moon is over 500 pages long and very little happens in those pages. I often found my mind\u2014and my eye\u2014wandering because she fills the book with meaningless fluff and repetitions. She obviously needs to read Richard Lanham\u2019s Revising Prose again and start cutting out the lard. Unfortunately, the series has the same addictive properties for me as Days of Our Lives and Passions. The soap operas are absolute drivel, but I just have to know what happens next (and check out that hottie Elvis, Junior). Unfortunately, I do want to know what happens next in Meyer\u2019s series, and I am even contemplating doing the unthinkable: buying Eclipse. Shoot me now. ...more New Moon is the second installment of the Twilight Series and with a broken heart I have to say that it was not as expected. Yes, I've read it without breathing but only because I wanted to search for the one thing that interested me: the relationship between Bella and Edward. We all know what happened, they split, leaving Bella heartbroken and vulnerable. If I would want to analyze the reasons that made Edward take this decision, I would not portrait him as the bad guy. Here I am very subjective New Moon is the second installment of the Twilight Series and with a broken heart I have to say that it was not as expected. Yes, I've read it without breathing but only because I wanted to search for the one thing that interested me: the relationship between Bella and Edward. We all know what happened, they split, leaving Bella heartbroken and vulnerable. If I would want to analyze the reasons that made Edward take this decision, I would not portrait him as the bad guy. Here I am very subjective and tend to understand everything he does. But a part of me knows that he was right. His world was different that Bella's and the incident with Jasper at her birthday party only made him realize the extend of the danger Bella is facing everyday. He loved her and that stood more alive than anything he felt. That was sacrifice in the most purely form and I admired him as a hero. The other part of me told me he was wrong. After you go through so many things with the one you love, you just don't give up on her, even if the cause is greater than anything. You protect her, you fight for her and especially you ask her if she wants to stay by your side. You don't take the decisions in her name. That is what Edward did and from my point of view it was not OK and lead to a lot of mess.. Edwards departure lead to Bella being friends with Jacob Black. We all know that he is in love with her her and in a way took advantage of her situation to win her off. I am not blaming Jacob or saying that he took advantage in an awful way. He was there for her, made her feel better and in a way healed her of the hurt she felt when Edward left. But, he knew that he could get close to her only if he is gone, because in another situation, Bella would have chosen Edward without even thinking twice. This rivalry between Jacob and Edward was born in Twilight and evolved in a very complex thing in New Moon. They are natural enemies because of their nature, but not, with Bella in the picture, they hate each other even more. I liked the way the 2 characters are put in an antithesis: cold vs warm, calm vs anger, wisdom vs eagerness, they couldn't have been more different. The only good thing that came from this rivalry and experience was the way Bella developed as a heroine. In the first book she was kind of weak, vulnerable and everyone had to her rescue. Now, after feeling how life is without Edward, she managed to continue living, despite her adrenaline rush and needs to see him, feel him only just a short period of time. The book was not consistent: it started out interesting and with a strong plot, but for me, after Edward left it just became flat and boring. I was intrigued by the development of Bella and Jacob's relationship, but not for a long period of time. I was just soooo focused on Edward returning that I could think of anything else. This inconsistency only made me classify the book in 2 parts: Before and After Edward. The last part was the most interesting, especially the last dialogues between Bella and Edward, but all-together, it wasn't something that was worthy of waiting 300 pages for. 3 stars for this one.

New Moon was absolutely heart-wrenching (you can tell I invest heavily in these books can't you?!). But I was physically unable to put it down, and only just managed it for toilet breaks. It's Bella's 18th birthday and a simple paper cut as she opens her presents leads Edward's brother Jasper to almost kill her - to keep her safe, Edward decides to sever ties with her, convincing her that the Cullen family must move on - must leave Forks - and so must she. She does not take it well. After a week of being catatoinc and several months of going through the motions like a depressed zombie she discovers that if she does something reckless and her adrenaline gets going, she hears Edward's voice talking to her in her head. And so, in order to hear it again, she enlists the help of her friend from the reservation, Jacob Black, into restoring an old motorbike and teaching her how to ride it. Jacob is the only one able to block out the pain of Edward's absence, so Bella starts spending a lot of time with him. When he suddenly breaks contact with her, she's determined to see him again. Which is when she discovers that the old tribal legends are not just superstitions: he's become a werewolf, a protector of the people - from the vampiric Cullen family, against which they have deep enmity. Only the treaty between them keeps them from attacking Edward and his family. The pack of 5 werewolfs - all young men from the reservation - are on the track of a pair of vampires who are hunting for Bella and manage to kill one, Laurent. Victoria is still on the loose. Meanwhile, despite the danger, Bella is still doing what she can to hear Edward's voice again. So she decides to cliff-dive, which works, but she nearly drowns. Edward's sister Alice, who sees the future, thinks she sees Bella die - and so rushes back to Forks. Unfortunately, his other sister Rosalie, who has never liked Bella, tells Edward what Alice saw - and when Edward calls the house asking for Bella's dad, Jacob tells him he's at the funeral, neglecting to say whose funeral. And so Alice sees Edward rushing to Italy to do whatever it takes for the ancient, royal vampire family in residence there, to kill him. Alice and Bella must race against time to prevent it. There are several references to Romeo and Juliet in this one that make me a little nervous. If this trilogy has a sad ending I will be very upset! I felt so much for Bella, her pain was so believable, her yearning so bitter, I felt like I was going through the same thing. The scenes where she hears Edward's voice in head, warning her, advising, pleading with her not to do something reckless, often had me laughing with exuberant relief - the sound of his voice had just as much an effect on me, it seemed. And even though I was quite sure she would rescue him in time, like Bella I was never quite sure whether he would stay, or leave again. All in all I am getting just a little bit too wound up in this story, but I can't help it and there's one more left which I have already started and almost dread finishing. My hope is that Bella will get her wish and be turned into a vampire, so that they can stay together. I have my fingers crossed, but that's why the references to Romeo and Juliet make me so anxious, as if Meyer is setting up for a tragic ending after so much love and loss. ...more Few people mention that Meyer is a member of the Church of Latter-Day Saints. I say this not to judge her or color someone's opinion of her, but to throw into perspective her possible motivations behind the plot for this book, namely the religious dialogue and the \"together forever\" aspect of Edward's and Bella's relationship.

I say this not to judge her or color someone's opinion of her, but to throw into perspective her possible motivations behind the plot for this book, namely the religious dialogue and the \"together forever\" aspect of Edward's and Bella's relationship. Two people in love being together for eternity is a touchstone of the Mormon faith, which is what we see in Edward and Bella: they are meant for one another, no question about it. Up until this point in the series, they have been destined for one another on a fate level, not a religious one. None of the characters in the books really express a preference toward any particular religion, and there are no hallmarks to impress upon us that anyone is Catholic, or Lutheran, or Mormon, or any other faith. The discussion is about souls , and whether or not vampires go to Heaven after they are removed from their existence--ie, after they're crumbled up into tiny bits of rock and set on fire because they can apparently reassemble themselves like Paladins. And Edward, with his Edwardian (har har) sensibilities, can't imagine a scenario with him winding up in front of old Peter and the Gates. So he is refusing! Staunchly! To allow Bella to become a vampire! Or even to be near him and madly in love with him! Because that is so wrong and he would be putting her pure and wonderful and probably tasty soul in danger. So he takes off with little to no explanation except that he is fickle and does not love her anymore. While we the audience see this as an obvious bluff (not in the least because Meyer hits us over the head with \"clues\" that Edward doesn't really mean any of his protestations), Bella in her warped mind cannot, and so spends the months after his little jaunt mourning the loss of her beloved. And we get four simple pages with months written on them, representing a loss of time and showing us how devastating it's all been for her. But what happens after that is what nullifies the impact of those four almost-blank pages/months. Bella goes on throughout the rest of the book holding her arms over her chest because there is a giant gaping metaphorical hole in her spirit. The impact of this is greatly lessened after we have to hear about it for a good hundred pages, and Meyer probably could have done much better if she had employed a less-obvious tactic. Bella going about her business as though absolutely nothing was wrong with everyone else around her tiptoeing gently around the eggshells of Edward would have been an interesting touch. There are certain aspects of this book that make it almost as compelling as Twilight , such as Bella's propensity toward danger just so that she can hallucinate that Edward is yelling at her to stop. But like an addictive drug, it wears off, and she is left trying to pick up the pieces by forming a stronger relationship with Jacob Black and all the secrets behind his Native American tribe. Meyer tries to tempt Bella and the reader into swaying their loyalties for Edward by making Jacob oh-so attractive and present in a time of need, but it just doesn't work. Meyer herself can't understand why people just don't seem to like the poor kid, but it's hard to love a replacement as much as the original, and the attempted contrast between dark and light, cold and heat, or Romeo to Paris fizzles out. The best part of the book, unfortunately, comes saddled with all manner of improbabilities: namely the sudden flight to Italy, the stealing of an extremely expensive and conveniently fast and stylish car, and turn-around sudden flight back to Washington state. If Bella spent the entire book hugging a psychological/spiritual hole in her middle, the idea that she was able to instantly forgive Edward for the last tortuous seven months (and 200 pages) and withstand being awake for two 12-hour flights, not to mention being tormented by ancient vampires, it's a miracle she hasn't been committed. That having been said, the scene in the piazza is some of the best you can get out of Edward and Bella. What's too bad is that it only comes after eons of sludge-y character development and bad attempts at forming a \"difficult decision\" between which boy (and which mythical creature) Bella will wind up with, and then follows with a punch-drunk \"family vote\" on whether or not Bella will join the coven's ranks. It's plot-driven and you're compelled to read, but be aware that this novel contains little of mysterious Edward. That, I think, is its greatest shortcoming. ...more So, I found myself strangely addicted to the crack that is the Twilight saga.

She is so upset that she doesn\u2019t want to be reminded by celebrating her birthday, but of course, Alice, Edward\u2019s sister, always gets her way when it comes to parties and the Cullens throw her one anyway. However, this party goes horribly awry as Bella is injured while Edward attempts to protect her from his brother who wants to eat her. (Guess she smells good to him, too.) Now having proof they are a danger to her, the Cullens leave Bella behind, but not before Edward fills her head with lies that he is over her and extracts a promise from Bella to not do anything stupid that would put her in harm\u2019s way, for Charlie's sake of course. So begins her emotional breakdown as she lives the next few months as a shell of a human being. She is nothing without her man and all his sparkly hawtness. That is all he has going for him\u2026his looks. This is one of the main themes I hate about this novel and the whole Bella and Edward relationship. This girl, who is supposed to be smart and mature (though I beg to differ) cannot seem to fathom a life without her dazzling, perfect Edward. But all he offers her is his perfectly angelic good looks. Can we say shallow, Bella? (Oh, okay he does play piano.) And does the fact that Bella is nothing without her man remind you of a certain someone from the first book that set Bella off to Forks in the first place? That\u2019s right her mom Rene. So why is it we should sympathize with Bella for leaving her mom, when her relationship with Edward isn\u2019t very different from Rene\u2019s relationship with Phil? Well, after receiving an ultimatum from her father, Bella gives herself a kick in the pants and tries to live her life somewhat like a normal teenager. That\u2019s where the story of Jacob and Bella starts. Now I love Jacob. He\u2019s expressive, he has a hobby, and he hangs out with his friends doing normal teenage stuff. He has a personality and he's a werewolf! I have nothing against Jacob liking Bella as a friend but falling for her over motorcycles seems a reach to me. She was so obviously using him. I wanted him to slap her and tell her to get real. I wanted her to realize what she had been missing when she was being with Edward \u2013 a life. Even though, I knew Edward\u2019s return was inevitable, I thought it would have added a nice complexity to have him return to a Bella who did get on with her life and realize things weren\u2019t so bad after all (she toys with this idea for like, two seconds). Then he would have to work on getting her back and not with promises of sex (she could get that from Jacob) and immortality. But instead, Bella jumps off a cliff and Edward goes all emo and decides to kill himself. As much as I liked Jacob, I missed the Cullens and was glad they were back. However, when Edward returned I quickly grew annoyed with him. Edward is just creepy. I know he is suppose to be so good-looking (because Bella won\u2019t shut up about it), but what is so attractive about someone who is hard as stone, ice cold to the touch and whose lips are like marble? I guess Bella would get just as hot kissing Michael Angelo\u2019s David. At least a statue wouldn\u2019t try to control her every move. Or throw a tantrum when he doesn\u2019t get his way. So Bella is left running off to Italy to save his life and her fate at becoming a vampire is sealed. Now her selfish dream will be realized and she can leave her family and friends behind. Hurrah! At the end of the book, we are back to where we started, Bella wanting to be with Edward forever because he\u2019s so \u201cSparkly\u201d. He still thinks she smells good. You would think with all that time away from her he would have realized what he was missing-nothing. Even Bella says at the beginning of the book, \u201cI\u2019m really not that interesting.\u201d The least Meyer could have done was created some reasons as to why Edward can\u2019t live without her - and not because she smells good! That reason makes as much sense to me as a kid who is allergic to chocolate not wanting to share the candy he can\u2019t eat because he knows it tastes so good. I won't be reading this one again. ...more", "Title": "New Moon"},
