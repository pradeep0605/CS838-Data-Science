Deepak Chaswal is a unique poet who exhorts the mankind to revive and relive the ideals of compassion, pity, charity and peace. T.S.

I am more comfortable puttering around the shelves of the tried and true of ages past, generally losing interest after the Romantics. Still, there is some good contemporary poetry\u2014after all, I am a contemporary poet, so I hope some of us are worthy\u2014and Chaswal is one. This work is an amalgam of the secular and spiritual, melded together through the alchemy of imagery. He uses plenty of modern topics and concepts, but he often able to combine them with a Contemporary poetry is hit or miss for me.

This work is an amalgam of the secular and spiritual, melded together through the alchemy of imagery. He uses plenty of modern topics and concepts, but he often able to combine them with a deeper meaning reminiscent of older, thoughtful guru-style work. Many of the poems have a haiku feel to them even without the stylistic, and, therefore, sometimes end abruptly, seemingly in mid-thought, allowing the reader to carry on with the poem in his mind. \u201cPhoenix and I\u201d is my favourite of the collection, including, \u201cI used to play/With the phoenix/In the company/Of mild sun beams\u201d. Chaswal is an Indian writing in English, which may explain why the poems are not punctuated properly and there are some misspellings, that detract slightly from the work, though it is hard to tell with poetry as it allows for greater freedom of expression. I do deduct one star for this because I judge these to be errors rather than conscious stylistic preference. I am willing to read this poet again, and I recommend him to those who like a mixture of the old and new and/or those who like to interact with a poem as Chaswal\u2019s will sometimes make you dig for the meaning. ...more Poet Deepak Chaswal is nothing less than brilliant. His poems are majestic, straightforward and compelling. The tone of this collection, Meeting with Christ and Other Poems, is melodic and rich in imagery. My favorite piece, Colour, was both emotional and enduring. The first line struck me and lured me in... \u201cWithout the wings of imagination...\u201d Let Deepak Chaswal\u2019s imagination take deep inside his world. Personally, I can\u2019t think of a better way to spend a Saturday afternoon. 5 STARS! This review is from: Meeting with Christ and Other Poems (<---B>Kindle Edition</---B>) What a great way to start and end my day with poems! The flow was great and I couldnt wait to read the mext one.<---C>Deepak Chaswal</---C><+++>Meeting With Christ and Other Poems</+++>", "Title": "Meeting With Christ and Other Poems"},
