The opening chapter is stellar and haunting -- so much so that I slogged through 500+ pages on its promise alone. Anyone beginning this novel will (rightly so) expect a Southern Gothic murder mystery. The premise (at least the one outlined on the dust jacket) has so much potential -- set in a sleepy backwater Mississippi town, it follows the \"adventures\" of an overly precocious girl from a fallen plantation family (think Scout Finch meets Nancy Drew) who has vowed to find and punish her brother's killer. However, the novel's momentum is quickly stalled by chapters and chapters of *Abject Naturalism* -- scene after scene of lush, dramatic, heady descriptions, microscopically attentive odes to Southern hallmarks like kudzu, honeysuckle, bickering maiden aunts, decrepit railroad tracks, sassy black maids, biscuits with maple syrup, poor white boys who look like they could have stepped out of a Confederate tintype, etc. At first, I patiently waded through these indulgent and often silly window-dressings, encouraged ever so slightly by Tartt's prose style. However, Tartt takes unforgivable advantage of her linguistic flair, so much so that the suspense totally evaporates, and the true engine of the novel (the mystery and romance of the murdered brother) essentially gets lost among innumerable, inconsequential, floridly written digressions, all of which do nothing to advance the narrative. I carried 500 pages of information around in my head, determined to sniff out clues and sleuth alongside our protagonist - only to find, in the end, that it was a futile venture. ...more Currently reading this one and all I can think of is a passage from a writing-fiction manual that I read.

The guy who wrote the article said that he once wrote a whole book and his publisher told him that it was good back-story, it was good for the AUTHOR to get to know his characters so when he wrote about them - they'd be 3D and real but it wasn't necessary for the readers to know most of the stuff that was written. You can remove a lot of the bulk from that first draft and keep it to yourself in your notes. Things such as the character's births, clothing preferences, favourite foods and colours, hates, loves and so on. Tartt's work reminds me of that ... so many of the pages that are unnecessary, there's so much that could have been cut out but the thing is, I enjoy it. I really do. I wouldn't like it if every book that I read was as verbose and wandering as Tartt's, but I do so enjoy reading something like this on occasion. It reminds me of how much I enjoy language and the craft of beautiful sentence-structure, description ... how much I've always enjoyed story-telling about people and their surroundings. -------------- I finished this book last night and when I read the final sentence, my mouth dropped open slightly, the book dropped from my hand onto the floor and I rolled over, squeezing my eyes shut in hopes that I would go immediately to sleep and not come on Goodreads and spew forth wtf's. This woman knows how to write. She's great at it. But she goes frickin' NOWHERE with ANY of it. It's unbelievable! So unbelievable that I spent the entire book literally saying out loud, Oh.My.God, in reference to her superb ability to spew forth wonderfully crafted sentences and paragraphs about nothing. NOTHING! Anyone that can write an entire book about nothing is some type of wonderbeast. Don't get me wrong, I'm not attacking her for this - I'm really just astounded at her mad skills at weaving elaborate, wandering tales. I even thought, dude, this has to building up to some climatic ending and holy shit, if you ever get that far you will probably have the same astounded expression on your face as I did. There were so many times in this book while I was reading that I said to myself in my head: This.Lady.Is.Unfuckingbelievable. Four, five, TEN pages could pass without anything happening. YOU COULD SCRAP THESE PAGES and not know any better. Get someone to do that, get someone to rip every other ten pages out and you will never know what you have missed, plot-wise at least. There were sooo many moments where I'd be like, dude, how is this even relevant or necessary? WHY CAN'T I STOP READING?! The entire book; waffle. Amazingly crafted prose that goes nowhere . I felt like I was having to force myself through some of it, even though I was interested. I just wanted things to regularly happen and when they didn't, I got restless. I'd measure how much I had left to go and groan. Sometimes I'd pick my book up and realise that I was holding it upside down yet I'd been staring at the page for a minute or two. Sometimes I realised I'd written a to-do list in my head, planned dinner, said the alphabet backwards and counted to 100 in French whilst having turned four or five pages. I slept, ate and drank whilst holding this book open and staring at the page through my eyelids. But at the same time, I felt this inner battle, this conflict because I was bored BUT I WAS JUST SO GOD DAMN INTERESTED. It is a massive pile of words. Tasty, heavy, Southern-saturated wordy goodness. This entire review; waffle. Poorly constructed sentences that are trying to make a point. Something to do with too much sleep, not enough caffeine on rising. I won't be forgiven, but Tartt will. ------------------- Besides from ranting about Tartt's waffle - which another reviewer describes as this book being a 'reading experience'; a nifty way of describing it, this book really is good. You really do experience this novel. it's really nothing like any other book that I have read. The characters are the most dimensional, REAL people that I have encountered in a long time. I felt like I was there, I felt the heat, I heard the snakes, I almost felt like I could touch every part of <---C>Harriet</---C>'s house. I loved the relationships between the people and the descriptions of everything. Basically, I loved everything about this book except for the fact that nothing happened, and there's basically no resolution to any of the issues raised in the book but because of how well crafted it all is, I forgive her. ...more I sort of want to scream when I read lukewarm reviews of this book. Admittedly, people may get the wrong idea when they read the back jacket, or the first few pages, and anticipate some sort of murder mystery thrill. The death of Harriet's brother is merely background for her character. The skill with which Tartt explores the inner workings and thought processes of a virtually abandoned 12 year old girl whose older brother's murder has never been solved cannot be praised highly enough.

Let me just reiterate that: the mystery of who/what could have possibly been able to appear in someone's backyard, while the entire family is within hearing range and two kids are sitting on the back porch, and grab a nine year old boy and hang him in a tree, leaving no trace, motive, or evidence, IS NEVER SOLVED. Excuse me while I bash my head against the wall for a minute. ... Okay, I'm back. Disregarding that highly irritating nitpick that is guaranteed to keep me awake at night, <+++>The Little Friend</+++> is actually a very good story. Fascinating, terrifying, complex (at times a little too complex, I must admit - the extensive cast of characters was hard to keep track of at times), morbidly engrossing, and with an ending that refuses to tell you anything . Ahem. I'm fine, really. But seriously Donna: come on. I want to know who killed Robin. Know how badly? I'm tempted to start stalking you and showing up at your door in the middle of the night, demanding answers because I KNOW YOU HAVE THEM. Here's the thing: since <---A>Donna Tartt</---A> is basically a genius (see The Secret History , a more wrapped-up and concentrated story, and my favorite of the two Tartt novels), I've convinced myself that she has, in fact, figured out who the killer is. Not only that, I think she reveals who the killer is through a hundred little clues and details hidden throughout the book, and we as the readers are supposed to prove our worth by locating these clues, putting them all together, and solving the mystery. I'm sorry, Donna. I failed your test. How about this: if I come to your house and kowtow repeatedly while shrieking \"I'm not worthy! I'm not worthy!\" will you please, please throw a thickheaded reader a bone and tell me who killed Robin ? How about if I bring you chocolate? ...more Oh, Harriet, you poor dear. Twelve and a half, homely and unpopular. The girl with the antique-sounding name and possessor of an \"old soul.\" She has a gruff, common sense approach to life that eschews flattery and wins her few fans among her peers and relatives. In vain, the aunts tried to teach her to be polite. \"But don't you understand , darling,\" said Tat, \"that if you don't like the fruitcake, it's better to eat it anyway instead of hurting your hostess's feelings?\" \"But I don't like fruitcake Oh, Harriet, you poor dear.

That's why I used that example.\" \"But fruitcake is horrible. I don't know anybody that likes it. And if I tell her I like it, she's just going to keep on giving it to me.\" You certainly can't argue with that logic. Harriet was just a babe, plopped down in a wind-up swing, when her 9-year-old brother was murdered in the family's yard during a Mother's Day celebration. Now, her older sister mostly sleeps and cries. Her mother is mostly sedated. She is raising herself with the help of a stern grandmother, a gaggle of great-aunts and the housekeeper. Having nothing in common with girls her age, she hangs out with a passel of boys; enough boys so that they can play the apostles to her Jesus in a reenactment of the Last Supper. (This was one of my favorite parts of the book!) Her biggest goals for the summer? Avoid going to church camp and win the library summer reading contest. (Who could not LOVE this girl?) Oh, and she's decided to solve the murder of her brother, committed so many years ago. This bit of Nancy Drewism will land her smack dab in a nest of vipers (literally), and deep into the dangerous world of a family of meth-dealing ne-er-do-wells. This seems to be a love it/hate it title. I can see why it's not for everyone. The pacing is slow and languid, much like the Mississippi summer setting of the book. Things take their own sweet time unfolding. Many of the characters are not likable. And, yeah, there are unanswered questions. I kept reading because I was in love with Harriet. As one character describes her, ...Harriet was not sweet or whimsical by any stretch of the imagination. Harriet was a trip. And that she was... With distaste, Harriet reflected upon how life had beaten down the adults she knew, every single grown up. Something strangled them as they grew older, made them doubt their own powers - laziness? Habit? Their grip slackened; they stopped fighting and resigned themselves to what happened. \"That's Life.\" That's what they all said. \"That's Life, Harriet, that's just how it is, you'll see.\" Well, Harriet would not see. She was young still, and the chains had not grown tight around her ankles. Whatever was to be done she would do it. She would strike now--while she still could, before her nerve broke and her spirit failed her--with nothing to sustain her but her own gigantic solitude. She is gonna grow up to be one heckuva woman! ...more I gave this book three stars only because of the author's ability to use mood, setting, and descriptive in an incredibly amazing way. However, this book was the biggest cocktease ever. Chekhov once said that if a gun is laying on the table in the first scene it had better be fired by the last. I firmly believe this, but Ms. Tartt seems not to. Oh well.

However, this book was the biggest cocktease ever. Chekhov once said that if a gun is laying on the table in the first scene it had better be fired by the last. I firmly believe this, but Ms. Tartt seems not to. Oh well. It just seems that if you begin a book with a nine-year-old boy hanging dead from a tree, and the entire plot is driven from this, something should happen in the 555 pages of (sometimes incredibly indulgent) exposition. You'd think. Yes, she was describing class distinction and how families can be destroyed and decay, bladdy blah. I'd recommend reading A Member of the Wedding if you want to see that instead. But if you start a suspense novel and then morph it into a long-winded descriptive about redneck meth-heads mixed in with a coming of age story in the deep south...no! Pick a plot, please! Another thing I have a personal pet peeve of is Black Mammy Characters. You know, at one time in history...like in the Civil War...we were incredibly limited as a culture as viewing black people as, I don't know, human. This is the 21st Century however, and despite the fact that people actually think the tv show Weeds is funny, it wouldn't hurt to at least try to explore the revolutionary idea that black people are human and have a vocabulary that is not limited to speaking like Jim from Huckleberry Finn. I hate when *white* authors attempt to write black characters by using tired phonetic spelling that is just so fucking sadly offensive it makes me embarrassed for them. Now, I realize that the character of Ida didn't at all times rely on sad cliches...she just did most of the time. That whole part about her not really giving a shit about the kids was probably pretty accurate. But seriously, Hattie McDaniel died a long time ago and I'm really not sure they'll be able to find a Black Mammy stock actor to play Ida in the made-for-tv movie (on a side note, I think that Jenna Malone is too old for Harriet, but the mental casting the author did was really dead-on). Really, the bottom line is that the world needs another faux Southern Gothic quasi-racial drama like a hole in the head. The world doesn't need anymore Mammies...that's what that bottle of Aunt Jamima maple syrup is for. Just eat some damned pancakes, enjoy your racial superiority, and quit writing cliche Mammies...PLEASE! This book could have been great, but instead it was incredibly mediocre. I still don't think she's a bad writer, she's actually quite talented and has a real knack for creating mood...but man, learn when to fire that damned gun Ms. Tartt! ...more Review to come, I'm still a bit flabbergasted...

Powerful, deep and dark, fascinating, poetic, and just overall beautifully written. Harriet is a firecracker, a pistol, a \"trip.\" She's so completely herself and so completely relatable, it's almost eery. My childhood was nothing like Harriet's (maybe a little in that I spent a lot of time alone and got to where I preferred it that way), but I can remember feeling the way she feels, that anger and boredom and terror. My heart ached for her throughout the whole book. The rest of the characters are sharply drawn, as well, except when they\u2019re meaningfully fuzzy. Allison, Charlotte, and Libby are intriguing in their weakness, their otherworldliness. If Tartt gets a little flowery with her language (I think she does, just a bit), I feel it\u2019s justified. This is gothic, epic, real deep-down Suddenly Last Summer stuff, and it earns its flowers. I\u2019ve read a few reviews saying nothing happens. I couldn\u2019t disagree more. A LOT happens, it\u2019s just that not a lot of it is overt; a lot happens on the inside of people. Since I\u2019ve always lived in my head, I adored and related to the style of the thing. Yeesh, and the danger! There\u2019s danger everywhere. I was so nervous the majority of the time. I was enjoying myself, drawn into the story, refusing to stop reading while simultaneously NOT wanting to read anymore, lest something (else) bad happened. Ugh. I loved it. It was beautifully done and deep and dark and gorgeous. I need a thesaurus, whatever. Love. ...more Well, that was a huge disappointment. I had heard this was generally the least loved of Donna Tartt's novels, but I went into it expecting to like it a bit more than most because I adore her work. But no, sadly this was a big letdown. Overall this book just left me very confused. How did she go from such an atmospheric, well-written novel as The Secret History to this? And then to come up with the masterpiece, The Goldfinch ? I just don't get how she is the same author of this book. The writing Well, that was a huge disappointment.

Overall this book just left me very confused. How did she go from such an atmospheric, well-written novel as The Secret History to this? And then to come up with the masterpiece, The Goldfinch ? I just don't get how she is the same author of this book. The writing isn't bad, it's just not nearly to the caliber of her other novels. And you know those people, maybe friends or co-workers, who tell these long-winded stories and when they finish speaking, you're left going, \"...that's it?\" That basically sums up my feelings about this book. The whole time I was waiting for the story to arrive at some point where I could go, \"OH!! Yeah! Wow!\" and it would be redeemed. Sadly, it did not. A 1 star seems a bit harsh, because I suppose within the 555 pages there were some moments that kept me reading and interested. Though by the end I was SO over it, I just wanted to be done and know what happens. But even that didn't satisfy my enough to make it better. I'm really bummed because now I've read all 3 of her novels that are published, and I probably have to wait like 9 more years for another one. And this one didn't live up to the excellence of her other books. Ah well, at least I have The Goldfinch to appreciate. ...more This is such a great novel. I read it a few years ago, I think it was in 2004, I don't really remember now, but I know it was before I separated from Fabio since during the separation process I only read books by Chris Bojalian and books that Lauren mailed me. She didn't mail me <+++>The Little Friend</+++>, but I'm sure it is she who recommended it. Just last night, I was talking with my friend Jenna about this book (which I convinced her to read, and which she is reading now) and we were cracking up over This is such a great novel.

This is one of the most intriguing books in the history of writing. It should have won prizes, maybe it did. It's complicated but not overwhelming in its detail. It's clever without being overwrought. It's dark without making one want to be buried alive rather than finish a chapter. And it's Southern without being charming. Which is something to which I can relate. ...more I listened to this book on audio and would like to comment first that the narrator was excellent and gave a huge boost to the atmosphere of the Mississippi setting. And the book had tremendous atmosphere. Donna Tartt has proven that she can set a scene with the best of them. She can also write a great character and Harriet in particular is superb. In fact another book focussing on her as a teenager or an adult would be great! My problem stemmed from my interest in Harriet and her family.

Once the story switched to the Ratcliff family I lost interest and became irritated when page after page was spent on irrelevant side issues to do with their unpleasant lives. This was a long book and it took me a long time to listen to it. I liked it enough to finish it and the character of Harriet will stay with me. However it will not go down on my list of favourite books:) ...more Part one: while reading it... This is what you call a 'slow read'. It is impossible to race thru these pages. That is why I had two prior unsuccessful attempts to read this book. An impatient mood is not a good mindset to read this one.

But I loved The Secret History and I just know that Donna Tartt is a good writer. You just have to have quiet time on your hands to read this one. So I'm taking my time with this one and it's rewarding. The descriptions Donna Tartt uses are long and sometimes it takes pages and nothing really happens. But, as another reviewer said, boy, does Donna Tartt know how to write, eventhough nothing much really happens. How she describes persons, surroundings, history, landscape. It's something you have to take in slowly, taking in all the words in slowly. So I read this book when the weather is good, outside in the garden, like this weekend. It doesn't really work to read this book before going to sleep, I just don't take in the words as I should. I have come to accept that the storyline is slow. I love sitting down and reading pages & pages about the brothers Ratliff, about the aunts of Harriet, about the brokendown parts of the town.... it's beautiful writing. I'm around page 257 today, halfway thru, so I expect it will take some more time to finish this one. Part two: after having read it: December: I finished The Little Friend! Summer has gone and winter is here... and I did take time. Part of the reason being that I got this one as a very heavy hardcover, so while travelling, I just don't take it with me. And while travelling, I read the most. And at some point, I just concluded I needed this book besides my bed, to read a couple of pages every day, slow and taking in all the detail. I can imagine that some people feel betrayed becauwe of the beginning intriguing plot and then how this book progresses, but I have to say... I really don't care. I loved this book, the style, the characters, the story, the southern atmosphere. All of it. Sure I would have secretely liked to see a clear ending and a solution to the mystery, but at some point I saw it coming that this one was gonna be different. When I finally got through the first say one fourth one third of the book I started immensely enjoying this book. Donna Tartt is a great, talented writer. How great is it to get into the mind of a child growing up fast and describe it in such amazing detail! Four stars. I gave Secret History five, because I think that story on the whole was just a bit better than this one. Already looking forward to the next book of Donna Tartt. And I really have to reread the Secret History. Take your time with this one and enjoy it! ...more \u041f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0430 \u0441\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0430\u043c, \u0447\u0435

I just don't know what Donna Tartt did to open the floodgates to venom for her last 2 novels: The Goldfinch, preceded by The Little Friend. I say this not to gripe about your subjective opinion that you found The Little Friend boring, you detested the subject matter, or you simply dislike Donna Tartt's writing style or personality. Intelligent people don't quibble over such matters, since opinions are like a__holes. I am also not claiming you are somehow misguided by animus if you gave it one or two stars \"just because I thought it stunk.\" On the other hand, if you based your poor rating on your opinion that the novel lacked literary merit, I kindly ask you to consider the reviews of a legion of regularly published critics (those I could find on a recent search) who almost unanimously and certainly resoundingly applauded the worthiness of The Little Friend. I'll finish by offering my answers to criticism that the novel's subject matter or dialogue is unrealistic. Ms. Tartt is a couple of years older than I am, but we both grew up in small town Mississippi (for both of us, a majority of our formative years were spent in 1970s MS). I assure you that I know the characters in this novel, in a manner of speaking. Though I've never met Ms. Tartt, I've known these character traits, and feelings, and dialect and thought processes (or lack thereof), in both the young and the old. I am also very familiar with the setting, generally; yes, Mississippi has many water towers (and, btw, fire towers). Okay. Thank you. I needed to vent a little. I'll write a full review in the near future. ...more Donna really screws the pooch on this one. She makes a very likeable character, a smart, precocious little girl in a small country town who makes enemies with a group of meth-heads while trying to solve the mystery of her 9-year-old brother's hanging when she was a baby, and turns it into a 576-page snoozefest. I eventually had to go to a library miles away and check out the audio version so I didn't have to waste my precious eyesight reading it.

The same complexity and richness of character, the same explosion of detail that makes The Goldfinch so memorable can be found in a slightly less orderly way. Less orderly in the sense that this book didn't quite have the tight narrative structure where there is little that is told that is not important to the story. This book could have lost fifty or so pages without it affecting the plot line. But who cares, rea This is one of Tartt's earlier books published before her acclaimed The Goldfinch. The same complexity and richness of character, the same explosion of detail that makes The Goldfinch so memorable can be found in a slightly less orderly way. Less orderly in the sense that this book didn't quite have the tight narrative structure where there is little that is told that is not important to the story. This book could have lost fifty or so pages without it affecting the plot line. But who cares, really, when those extra fifty pages are fascinating in their own right. This is a story of twelve-year-old Harriet. Like most of Donna Tartt's main characters, Harriet is, well, unusual. Unusual in the kind of way we all are, if someone got to know us as deeply as the author let's us know Harriet. Harriet's life is unusual too. She is motivated by the murder of her older brother when she was just a baby and her goal in life is to find the person who killed him and avenge his death. This simple plot line takes place in a small town in Mississippi and the characters that inhabit this world are both recognizable and like no-one you've ever met before. Now and then, if you like to write, you run into books that are worth reading at least a couple of times. The first time just for the pleasure of it and the second time, more carefully, to observe how the author pulled it off. This is one of those books. Especially if you, like me, are a fan of the omniscient narrator. You know the kind that jumps into the minds of twenty or so characters without missing a beat. When you read this kind of book you get the sense of someone conducting a one-hundred piece orchestra, of a hundred instruments losing themselves to produce one musical experience. The other thing you learn from a book like this, if you like to write, is that writing is all about the concrete, the particular, the hard atoms of life and spirit that make our world and our lives. Here's writing behind which you can detect expertise on muscle-cars, amphetamines, Houdini, revolvers, snake handling preachers (and snakes), summer camps, the Bible, the Civil War, to mention just a few. You have to be grateful for people like Tartt who give years of their lives to first acquire and then transform this expertise into an an art that enriches you and me. ...more Ponderous and immersive This novel starts slowly and never really picks up speed.

Readers should be forewarned that despite The Little Friend \u2019s summary, this isn\u2019t a murder mystery. The mysterious murder is a background concern, a persistent nagging on the edge of twelve-year-old Harriet\u2019s consciousness. The story is really about--within the first 226 pages, that is--the day-to-day life and antics of Harriet and her cute friend Hely, and the pace is very leisurely, peppered with complex, often beautiful sentences. It\u2019s also an entertaining character portrait of some charming Southern personalities. This is no urgently paced, heart-pounding murder mystery. These characters sit and laze away oppressively humid summer days, and that\u2019s how Donna Tartt wanted the reader to digest this story--to sit with it. When the focus shifts from Harriet\u2019s colorful family to a set of less interesting, less distinctive characters, the story slows considerably. Part of the problem is that this set of characters--brothers Harriet suspects were involved in her brother\u2019s murder--blends together. Tartt tried (one, for instance, is mentally disabled; one is described--impressively--as resembling a bear), but they just don\u2019t stand out, and it\u2019s a burden to keep track of who is who. The story is no longer much fun to read and definitely isn\u2019t a page-turner. A skimming of the remaining 329 pages reveals that these characters continue to take center stage, so apparently the story never reclaims the engaging tone of its earlier pages. It must be said that the writing isn\u2019t problematic; it really is the story itself. The actual artistry of Tartt\u2019s writing is, as has always been true of her, of the highest order. This definitely is the same author who lovingly strung together the stunning sentences of The Secret History and The Goldfinch . The Little Friend shouldn\u2019t be one\u2019s first experience with Tartt\u2019s work. Goodreads\u2019s low average rating is right; this is Tartt\u2019s weakest. It doesn\u2019t maintain momentum the way The Secret History and The Goldfinch do. Skipping this one won\u2019t be any loss. ...more Sometimes, I do believe, one's expectations can completely ruin a book for a person.

At first I wanted to give this book 4\u00bd stars ... actually more like 4.4 because I'd \"rounded down\" to 4 ... but then something interesting happened ... I felt like I wanted to reread the book even though it hadn't been very long since I'd (yes, finally!) finished it. I wanted to re-immerse myself in the amazingly rich, strange, dark, frightening, alternatively heartbreaking and hilarious world of Harriet and her quest to find out who killed her brother Robin. So ... unlike many readers here, I came to The Little Friend with zero expectations ... and, as advertised, once I was properly \"immersed\", I loved it. Did the author do my bidding for me and tell me everything I might have wanted to know by the story's end? No, but I don't ultimately believe that it makes sense to scold or berate an author for not writing a different book than the one she actually did write. To fully appreciate any book, but especially a book like this, we need \u2013 I certainly needed \u2013 to \"surrender\" to, to accept, the author's offering, on her own terms.

I imagine that many people, me included, do not want a 10 page description of two troubled twentysomething doing crystal meth and getting sunburnt in the middle of July. I actually made the 200 page mark. With the potential of more sweaty boys on drugs in the next 400 pages, I put the book down and re-read The Secret History instead. The really bad news about this book is that I have finished it! The really good news is that it goes straight into my bury me with this book bookshelf. An absolute busting-out-of-itself 5\u2605 A lot of people are hard on this book, and I agree with most of the criticism. But I still gave it three stars. Tartt\u2019s novel after this one, The Goldfinch, is one of my favorite books of all time, and I think that she needed to write The Little Friend in order to learn how to write The Goldfinch.

Both are about kids that suffer a deep loss and never really recover and both are larger-than-life, epic stories. Actually, the connection is even more basic. Both novels are about how people survive, what they do in order to go on, when they are in terrible pain and everyone around them doesn\u2019t understand or even care. Both have brilliantly drawn characters, a profound sense of place, dark humor, and a truly audacious plot. In The Little Friend, Tartt takes her first shot at that concept and misses. The writing is almost laughably overwrought. The ending is unsatisfying. The themes never pay off. There are too many characters and too few answers. Yet I forgave much of it because I could see her writing her path into The Goldfinch. And when looked at that way, as an exploration of an artist\u2019s development and growing mastery, The Little Friend becomes a much more interesting read. ...more I had really enjoyed the author's other books but I just didn't get on with this one.

It was just the sort of book I have been yearning for, one you can't put down and when you do you have to sort of remind yourself to return to the real world and set the characters aside when called away to, you know, work or eat.

I read her other book, The Secret History, many years ago and remember liking it enough but I found The Little Friend to be much more at every level. The author's voice is a character in itself. She chooses her words almost surgically and the reader embodies each point of view for each character as she draws us in with memorable archetypal characters and help us to understand them. This compliments a photographic mind for textured detail of the eras covered. I'm glad I waited to write a comment though. Those who have read it will understand what I mean when I say I was hoping for a certain \"reveal\" that was not forthcoming. I wondered at first if it was between the lines and I missed it. Finally, maybe slower than I should have, I could see that the ending is perfect, offering the ultimate in irony and human understanding. Lots of tribute to well-known literature of the South. The main character echoes Scout, and the brilliant short story A Good Man is Hard to Find was called forth more than once in the situations the characters got tangled up in. Highly recomended. A near-perfect contemporary novel, it has it all. ...more This is the story of two families, the Dufresnes and the Ratliffe living in Alexandria, Mississipi.

The mystery directs the plot and adds suspense. Harriet, a twelve-year old living in Alexandria, Mississippi, during the 70s, has decided she must solve the mystery of who killed her brother, Robin. He was nine at his death, she only a few months old. All she knows is what she has been told. How reliable is that information? For me there are plot events that are beyond belief, but OK, you are delivered an exciting story. Themes covered include drug racketing, Revival Snake believers and two little kids trying to solve a murder. It is also a coming of age story and about a dysfunctional family. It is with these two themes that the character portrayal comes in. The author is extremely talented in her ability to understand how people behave in particular situations. She understands people....with all our foibles. Not only does she understand but she mirrors this in what her characters say and do. All of the characters, from different walks of life, are wonderfully portrayed. Blacks, whites, non-believers, religious, healthy and ill, the poor and the wealthy, the aged, the young and those half-way through. Dialogs reflect each character perfectly. Common human experiences are captured with words as if through the lens of a camera. It is all of this that I absolutely loved. There is humor. (See below for an example.) I came to care for many of the characters. For me this is an essential ingredient for a successful novel. The characters feel utterly real. None can be seen as totally bad or good. It is for this accurate portrayal of people and daily experiences that I recommend the book. A word of warning. The mystery is not conclusively solved, but it is pretty clear what has happened. What is important is to see how Harriet's need to understand and solve the mystery changes. You watch her growth. Neither is it clear at the novel's end even how the immediate future will unfold. This is not a book for those of you who want conclusive answers either to what has happened or what will happen in Harriet's life. I think this reflects how we all actually live life. How often do we have a clear view of what life holds in store for us, or even what will happen tomorrow? All we can do is figure out what will guide our own behavior. I listened to the audiobook narrated by Karen White. Very well executed. The narration is clear and has a good tempo. I do wish she had paused a bit when the subject totally switches to another time and place and other characters. There are few chapters, so these switches occur within chapters. ********************************** I have listened to about half: The text below may give the impression that this is predominantly a cute, sweet story, that it doesn't cover dark themes. I do NOT want to imply this. There are serious psychological and social problems covered within these pages. ********************************* I am right at the beginning: Here I go again...when I love a book I am reading I have to tell others. It doesn't matter how this book ends. It is the passage through the book that is so wonderful. Donna Tartt knows people. She has not forgotten how children feel. AND she lets us laugh at those horrible things that happen in all families. This is right at the beginning, so in my view it can't be considered a spoiler I have to show you what this book holds. Don't read this paragraph if you consider this a spoiler, although I don't. Weanie(sp), the cat, is dying. She IS 16.5 years old so what can one do?! Harriet and her sister Alison are at their grandmother's where they usually eat breakfast because their mother doesn't bother to fix anything ....since the death of their brother Robin, and that was 12 years ago! Edie, the grandmother, is at her wits end. Alison has for hours been prone on the floor sobbing. Harriet is reading about brave explorers who had to EAT people who were dying. The point being one MUST be brave, the explorers were brave and look their situation was even worse!(Harriet's answer to problems are to be found in books and logical thinking.) Alison is the one who always cries, but you will understand if you have read from the beginning. Already the personalities are crystal clear. This is the background, but here is what I wanted to tell you. Of course Edie cannot do miracles, so she says she is taking the cat to the vet to have her put to sleep. At this even Harriet starts screaming too. Grandmother leaves. Harriet is so mad she gets a pin and carves in her grandmother's bed \"I hate Edie!\" That isn't enough. She goes to the encyclopedia and cuts out a picture of a baboon and glues that onto a picture of her grandmother in the photo album. Now tell me, isn't this how life really is? And here is what is important: Tartt understand how people behave and she makes us laugh at what is horrible in life. We've all been there; we know what she is saying. You know I don't give a darn usually about fictional mystery stories. Why should I care who killed Robin? He doesn't exist, but I do care. This is clearly a book of character portrayal too. Even if you are doubtful, as I was, you have to give this book a try. ...more", "Title": "The Little Friend"},
