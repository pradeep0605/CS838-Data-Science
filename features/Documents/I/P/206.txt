This review contains *spoilers* . It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve had that feeling of wanting to read a story long into the night, but Persepolis brought it back. I felt this indescribable pull from the very first page and I just knew that this book was going to hold a special place in my heart. Persepolis feel so personally important to me that I\u2019m stunned they didn\u2019t appear into my life until these past few days. Everything featured within; leaving, moving, coming-of-age,<---M> family relationships</---M>, motherly love\u2014 was just captured so personally well. I really, really missed Marji\u2019s family (<---B>especially her mother</---B>) at the start of this volume. I kept hoping for her to talk about or with her mother. But the conversations she had with Julie were also pretty interesting to read about. This book had surprisingly many laugh out loud moments when Marji started out in Vienna. And the beauty of this story, for me, was that one moment you\u2019ll be laughing, and the next your laughter will turn to tears. For instance, when she finally got the message that her mother was coming to visit: Watching Marjane grow and accumulate on her own was honestly both heartbreaking and heartwarming. I\u2019m in tears\u2026again. The time she spent with her mother made me feel that more closer to both of them: The love they hold for each other punctured me deeply. And it made her departure that more painful. From there we follow Marji\u2019s journey living and working on her own. And we get introduced to great and not so great (Markus) characters along the way. Svetlana was a great surprise. But Markus\u2026 seriously, how insensitive can one person be?? I was so angry when he had the nerve to say, \u201cit\u2019s not what you think\u2026\u201d And everything that went on afterwards left me speechless: from sleeping on the streets of cold-wintery Vienna, to returning to Iran and still feeling helpless, to not knowing how to share everything that went on during the 4 years she spent away from her family, and then the road to recovery. She went through so much in the span of four years, and it made me that more upset when people took advantage of her situation. But Marjane allows her past to weigh heavily on her until she finds some like-minded friends, falls in love, and begins studying art at a university. At her university Marji said the following that\u2019s been on my mind ever since: I loved this volume more both because I saw Marji coming of age and also because Persepolis' depiction of the struggles of growing up was raw, honest, and incredibly illuminating. This book opened up my eyes and gave me a new perspective, and I am now forever grateful. And then all too soon the storyline came to an end and I was left with eyes full of tears (both happy and sad). It was brilliant, poignant, memorable and just utterly fascinating. *Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate. If you're interested in buying Persepolis 2 , just click on the image below to go through my link.

Alright, the second half of this story (#3 & #4) is less about the revolution, and more about a young woman growing up, and discovering herself along the way. Yes, it's a fish-out-water story, but most stories are when you're talking about that period of time between teenager and adult. Satrapi has an extra layer of awkwardness, because she's alone in a foreign country during this time. Plus, the upheaval that happened in her country during her childhood gave her a different outlook on things than most of the children teenagers in her boarding school. Bottom line, though? Everyone wants to fit in at that age. So, she does what we all did during that time of our life. She experiments, she rebels, falls in love, gets her heart broken, gets her pride crushed, loses herself, and then makes her way home. Unfortunately, Iran wasn't exactly the kind country that made it particularly easy to explore who you are or find yourself . The blending of religious values with laws made it hard for her, and other young adults, to do the normal things that most of us take for granted as rites of passage. And I'm not saying the men in her country had it easy, but being a woman in such a repressed society? Wow. It's hard to believe that there are still places like this in the world. Ok, while this was a really good story, it didn't quite move me as much as the first book. Still, it's definitely worth reading. And there were several things that surprised me about this one. The biggest shock was that this was not a sad story. I thought it would end with bloodshed or something! Nope. There's no Happily Ever After, but it leaves you satisfied. Also, Marjane's parents were pretty awesome. I don't want to spoil anything for those of you who haven't read this, but when I grow up, I want to be like those guys. I hope I have the guts to let my kids be themselves and make their own mistakes. I don't think you need to be a woman to get this book, either. I think anyone can read this and find something of themselves in Satrapi's story, because it's about finding out who you are, and then being true to yourself. Even when it's not easy. ...more Everyone needs to step off! Geez! This book is great. It doesn't have that cute little panache of the first book because, duh, it's not about pre-teen issues which are cute and naive--it's about the world of impulsive effacement that drags a teenager to become a young adult. She comes to be a part of the Western world she idealized and finds it colder , in a more subtle, acute way, than the repressive regime she escapes in the first book. Because as violent and absurd as the regime is, she still Everyone needs to step off! Geez! This book is great. It doesn't have that cute little panache of the first book because, duh, it's not about pre-teen issues which are cute and naive--it's about the world of impulsive effacement that drags a teenager to become a young adult. She comes to be a part of the Western world she idealized and finds it colder , in a more subtle, acute way, than the repressive regime she escapes in the first book. Because as violent and absurd as the regime is, she still exists in a harbor of love. She finds the West to be devoid of real faith in people. Everyone is deceptive, all points are theoretical. The criticism she has is of the dullness and hypocrisy of rebellion, arguing that the Europeans are selfish and mundane. It's not as fiery as the first book, because it's a rehashing in a different context; i would even say it's more interesting than the first book, because of this. Yet the cute little blips are still there, take for instance the panel where she goes through puberty in a month and showcases the bizarre morphings that her body goes through, going to her roommates farm in the middle of the mountains and her mother has a moustache and her sister is heidi. there's not so much connection to the revolution and personal relationships effected by the regime. Because this book is more about her and her exile, the formations of characters killed by the autocracy are kept out. So that indulgence of catharsis is staid from, besides her character. But she feels so much! In this tiny book, she grieves and is frustrated time and time again, and the pace with which she moves out of it--it's compelling. She doesn't form these heroic relationships, really at all, so to try to contrive them would be lame. Though there is the point where she goes to chat with a legless soldier whom she knew from her childhood and the awkwardness is very thick, until he tells a joke about a maimed soldier trying to get married and the passive exchange, the white elephant, is lifted. Suddenly, they can talk like souls. If this book has anything to say independently of the first book, it's in the contrast of the West to the East, a cold and free menagerie versus a familiar zone of horror. And still she dances through it, like roberto benigni in \"Life is Beautiful.\" Another thing i wanted to mention is this is a great documentation of supportive parents that i feel should be warranted. The liberal values and hospitality towards adolescence they exhibit are warm and i feel like the novel is based on that, that structural support of family which is the basis for her ability to grow out of both sides, her punk-european facade and the seemingly inescapable plague of fundamentalism. So hurrah for Satrapi's folks, eh! ...more This is the continuing story of Marjane when her parents send her away to Austria where she has to live in a bunch of different places and doesn't understand a lot of what's going on. It's still a really sad story. I watched this dvd and my friends link will show some of the gifs from the movie. It's a sad book and movie. Anne's Review Persepolis the First was touching. Persepolis the Second was not. The teen-aged Marjane is sent to Vienna where she is bounced from place to place by both circumstance and her own big mouth.

Marjane, abandoned and isolated, turns to drugs and questionable friends and lovers to get through this time. Though she is apparently bright, she barely gets through school. After she catches her boyfriend cheating on her, she spends three months on the street and then returns to Iran. Once in Iran, it really gets jolly and fun. Marjane is depressed. She attempts suicide. There are some ups, but a lot of downs. I won\u2019t list them all and spoil it for everyone else, but REALLY! All of this bad, sad, and terrible stuff is going on, and I didn\u2019t feel anything. Nothing. Maybe it\u2019s because a lot of the sadness was caused by her own actions. (It should be noted that I generally have a low tolerance for stupid teenagers.) Maybe it\u2019s because it was told in a detached way. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m heartless. In any case, it didn\u2019t feel personal. It didn\u2019t feel as though the events in the book happened to the author. I didn\u2019t relate to Marjane, and I didn\u2019t sympathize with her. Also, the graphic element in this book didn\u2019t really add anything for me. I don\u2019t know. This book just left me cold. A couple things did work for me, though. Marjane turns to reading at lonely times in her life, and remarks that \u201cone must educate oneself.\u201d True. True. One other item rang true to me: when Marjane gets to Austria, one of her first purchases was scented laundry detergent. It wasn\u2019t available in war-torn Iran. She mentions that even today she keeps a dozen or so boxes of scented detergent in her house. I wish there had been a few more of those personal moments in the book. ...more I think what ultimately made this novel fall flat for me is that I was prepared for something more along the lines of \"thought-provoking\" and \"eye-opener\" and instead finished this feeling rather disappointingly underwhelmed.

I thought the author's idea of writing her autobiography in the form of a comic, to be an intriguing and fun premise, but also, perhaps a problematic one as well. While certainly being innovative, I just don't think that there was enough strength and potency, in either the words or the pictures, which was unfortunate because the author had a real chance to really impact the reader with graphics that could speak a thousand words in thunderous volumes. I found the overall tone of the narration to be more along the lines of fanciful/whimsical with an added touch of self-pity, and at times I could not take Satrapi seriously, much less identify with her or even sympathize. It's important for me to feel connected with the characters I read, even more so in an autobiography that serves as a political memoir, but the circumstances for Satrapi were filled with so much teenage stupidity and imprudence, and seemed to be so distant and faraway from the hardships and trials that the people of Iran were suffering from, leaving me far-flung from the issues as well. In all honesty, there was just not enough meaningful moments for this to leave any real impact on me, and I find this memoir to be ironically unmemorable. ...more I wasn't too impressed with the first \"Persepolis\" book and, sorry to say, but I am impressed with \"The Story of a Return\" even less. Unlike many readers, I like the cartoon-like art of Satrapi's books. I also enjoy her anecdotes. The writer is at her best when she infuses humor in her otherwise dark life story. What I thoroughly dislike is the author herself. It is very rarely that I find no compassion for book characters. I mean, I can find love for all kinds of vile people, but no luck here.

What I thoroughly dislike is the author herself. It is very rarely that I find no compassion for book characters. I mean, I can find love for all kinds of vile people, but no luck here. I don't know if Satrapi realizes it, but she portrays herself in a very unflattering light - as a self-centered, self-important and self-righteous person. Satrapi is judgmental and hypocritical - she likes to criticize people for the vices she indulges in herself (I still remember her accusing her friend of being a shallow traitor for obsessing over a lipstick and her walkman when she herself was just as obsessed about her Nikes and audiotapes a few chapters before). She is ungrateful and disrespectful (she calls her nun teacher a prostitute after she is reprimanded for having bad manners). She likes to blame her misfortunes on other people when she is the source of them 99% of the time (she leaves her apartment and lives on the streets for 3 months and then complains later she was mistreated). She puts an innocent man into a mortal danger when she accuses him of talking to her in an indecent way, just to conceal the fact that she is wearing lipstick! The list goes on and on. Satrapi is full of self-pity and completely lacks any kind of introspection; she never owns up to any of the bad things she has done or blames herself for her misfortunes. She prefers to write off her bad decisions to indulge in drugs, promiscuity and general self-destruction on her loneliness and her war memories. But she fails to show these connections in any kind of sincere, meaningful way. It is obvious that my dislike for the narrator totally overshadowed the good parts of the book. I just think Satrapi was not (and still is not) a very self-aware person. However, I do see why her superficial, self-pitying and insincere memoir is so well-received. It fits very well into a very popular nowadays trend to vilify Iranian (or any fundamentalist) regime by providing all kinds of disturbing details of Muslim life style for us all to indulge in. ...more Didn't move me the way the first part did. I couldn't exactly relate to Marji and her problems. On one hand she grew up into a liberal, headstrong, take-no-shit-from-others kind of woman, while on the other she was insensitive enough to get an innocent man arrested just to protect herself from being caught wearing make-up. And here I was thinking she didn't care for make-up and outward appearances.

And here I was thinking she didn't care for make-up and outward appearances. She repeatedly contradicted herself and her own opinions and yet had the gall to assume a predominantly self-flattering tone while portraying herself in this novel. And Marji aside, this book did not focus on Iran as much as it did on Marji's personal life and that made it infinitely less interesting. Besides, what's the deal with her grandma saying 'A first marriage is only a dry run for the second.'? I am a woman of the 21st century living in the largest democracy of the world and criticisms aside, I believe it does manage to live up to its reputation as a nation with more or less liberal ideals. But I would never view a marriage in such a nonchalant, irreverent fashion. A marriage is not a social experiment or a dry run for anything. I am not against divorce, but I believe that should be the way out when a marriage no longer works or is irrevocably over. A way out doesn't necessarily give us the right to view a social institution with so much disrespect. ...more I borrowed both parts one and two of Persepolis from my friend Margaret. I flew through them both in one afternoon. They are a stunningly beautiful story of a girl growing up. People talk about the politics, the history and all of that... Yeah, that stuff is there, but ultimately its a story about a child trying to find who she is. The circumstances surrounding her are extraordinary, but that's only part of what makes it a good story. To me its greatness comes from how she tells her story, and how I borrowed both parts one and two of Persepolis from my friend Margaret. I flew through them both in one afternoon.

To me its greatness comes from how she tells her story, and how drawn into it you become. I was telling a friend about it the other day, and while her art is really cool, and fairly unique (at least in the graphic-novel world), it doesn't ever make you delay turning the page so you can linger on the art. It is all about telling the story in a compelling way, and it really does that. Its beautiful, heartbreaking, and I loved it. ...more i almost like this installment better than Persepolis , but i know that's because of how amazing the first book was. this installment finds marji in austria, where she is shuttled from place to place, getting her french education, while her family and friends remain in tehran. it's the story of a \"third-worlder\" in the west, and then an attempt to return home. it's almost more heartbreaking than the first book, because there is so much in here that is familiar while different, and so much that m i almost like this installment better than Persepolis , but i know that's because of how amazing the first book was. this installment finds marji in austria, where she is shuttled from place to place, getting her french education, while her family and friends remain in tehran. it's the story of a \"third-worlder\" in the west, and then an attempt to return home. it's almost more heartbreaking than the first book, because there is so much in here that is familiar while different, and so much that makes you realize how lucky you are. it's brilliantly written, again, and wonderfully illustrated, and it's a traditional coming of age story that is anything but traditional. it's beautiful, from the snow scenes in vienna to her joy at seeing snow in tehran again. the way she is older, the way she tries to fit in, the disintegration of relationships - the author writes with a wisdom that can only come from years of reflection, and we are all the better for it. her insights into her behaviors and actions are so clear and true, even though they might not reflect greatly on her, are masterful. the story doesn't lag, it goes forward, and forward, and at the end, i desperately wanted the next installment to magically appear in my hands. it's especially interesting to read this in light of where america stands on iran these days - and makes me think of theodor herzl calling people like me \"amiable dreamers\" but. books like this give me hope. it's truly a remarkable piece of work, unlike anything i have come across before. ...more I made the mistake of reading some other reviews that claim that Marjane's depiction of alienation, drug use, and homeless in Austria was largely her own fault, which somehow makes this second part of Satrapi's memoir less enjoyable, which is a ridiculous assertion.

Her story is told in a way that I really related to, despite the fact that I did not grow up in a war torn country or attempt an education overseas or return to find my home country ruled by fear of torture, death and enforced ignorance. I still wanted to hang out with Marjane and drink and smoke cigarettes and talk about fundamentalism, feminism and Marxism. (And the cold nature of Nordic peoples.) ...more 3.5/5stars I didn't like this one as much as the first one but that is not to say that I disliked it.

The illustrations are great and there were a couple of panels that I think were done phenomenally- they are simple but manage to convey a very powerful message. I really enjoy graphic novels! Marjane's story in this second volume becomes less about understanding the war and more about discovering herself. I really enjoyed reading about her dealing with loneliness and the shame of being safe in another country while her family struggled in war-torn Iran. Through the illustrations and the writing style (it feels like you are being told the story by a friend) I really felt for Marjane as she grew up away from those she loved. Honestly there isn't much I can say about this book that I didn't say in my review for the first one. The simple writing and drawing style provide the platform for a humourous and heartbreaking memoir that is filled with charm and wit. Read it! ...more This is quite a bit different than the first part but is just as fascinating.

Since Marjane is an adult in this book, it's easier to see how oppressive the Islamic revolution really was, since an adult *should* have so much more agency than a child. Marjane's feeling of being misplaced no matter where she was -- too 'traditional' for Europe, too 'progressive' for Iran -- will ring true to anyone who's ever felt like an outsider. Like the first one, this book brings politics and history that can seem confusing and irrelevant to \"Westerners\" personal and complex. Reading it is like having the conversation you'd be able to have if you weren't too scared of being politically incorrect or naive to open your mouth. ...more 3.5 stars. \u0395\u03b4\u03ce

brilliant, largely due to the fact that it presented the Islamic Revolution (a very messy, complicated history of political reform gone wrong) through the eyes of a precociously wise little girl who watched it unfold. So what happened to that little girl's uncanny wisdom in Persepolis 2? Apparently it disappeared with puberty. To be blunt, I thought this second book was only slightly better than various cartoons typical of Highlights for Children . Rathe Persepolis 1, the prequel to this story, was brilliant, largely due to the fact that it presented the Islamic Revolution (a very messy, complicated history of political reform gone wrong) through the eyes of a precociously wise little girl who watched it unfold. So what happened to that little girl's uncanny wisdom in Persepolis 2? Apparently it disappeared with puberty. To be blunt, I thought this second book was only slightly better than various cartoons typical of Highlights for Children . Rather than an eloquent presentation of a young woman struggling with her own statelessness and cultural assimilation (which I think was Satrapi's goal), this novel metamorphosed into a self-indulgent, self-pitying, mind-numbingly melodramatic sketch of Marjane's teen angst and isolation from normal social life. The book just didn't really work. Why? I guess overall I felt that any profundity concerning Marjane's temporary loss of cultural identity was overshadowed by the author's overemphasis on the kinds of stupid struggles that attend being a teenager in general. Let's face it: as teenagers, almost all of us experimented with some sort of mind-altering substance (remember Granny's tequila? You know you do). Most of us (minus the religious ones) had sex against the wishes of adult authority figures and despite the apocalyptic warnings of \"The More You Know\" public announcements. Nearly everybody had his/her heart broken at some point (unless s/he was out doing the heartbreaking, that is). Big effing whoop, that's just standard teenage stuff. Yet the book spends most of its time following Marjane as she lives through these standard teenage experiences and wallows in self-pity. Yippee skippy. My point is, what Satrapi really forgot to show us was what NOT everyone already experienced as a dumbass kid: the experience of a refugee who can't find sanctuary--whether psychological or physical--in her own country or any other country that she encounters. That's what would have made the book a valuable read. Sadly, it wasn't accomplished. Aside from that complaint, the story also didn't seem entirely genuine to me in certain places. Anybody who categorizes marijuana as a truly hard drug is CLEARLY an outsider to the culture itself. The whole \"I blew my mind out with marijuana, poor me\" portion of the novel struck me as extraordinarily poser--and nobody can spot a poser quite like an Oregonian. Are you lying to us about your \"hardcore\" drug experiences, Marjane? It just seemed unnecessary and overblown. The hour grows long, and so does this review, so I'll conclude by saying just this: I love Satrapi's other works and teach them in my upper division high school lit class, but this one was a disappointment. Read \"Blankets\" by Craig Thompson instead. ...more To the extent Satrapi conveys life in Iran during the Islamic Revolution, thumbs up. But both volumes suffer from relentless self-indulgence. I could never identify with her. I realize that Persepolis is a memoir, but memoirs are for memorable experiences, not the trivial disappointments of a teenager. Her angst seemed unconnected with the horrors of Iran. While she suffers from an oppressive regime and the associated loss of extended family, those structures only seem to provide window dressing To the extent Satrapi conveys life in Iran during the Islamic Revolution, thumbs up.

I realize that Persepolis is a memoir, but memoirs are for memorable experiences, not the trivial disappointments of a teenager. Her angst seemed unconnected with the horrors of Iran. While she suffers from an oppressive regime and the associated loss of extended family, those structures only seem to provide window dressing. Her enthusiasm for political demonstrations felt revisionist; as if she writes through glorified hindsight. The author does not synthesize those limitations and experiences into her personal development. She craves understanding from her audience without developing her own ability to understand. Even Holden, that eternal symbol of young angst, strove with ambition toward reconciliation with the world around him. Holden at least leaves me with hope. Satrapi flees eternally, without direction, and without motivation. Her problem is not the Iranian regime, it is herself. ...more Well.....I truly loved the first Persepolis, where the childhood story is told. I find the older (less wiser?) Satrapi far less sympathetic or engaging. Often, the character is downright abrasive and huge gaps are left in the story, with, once again, an ending that does not provide complete closure (not that it's a necessity to tie up loose ends... but it seemed like this book could warrant it more).

Despite the paling against Persepolis 1, (less text, more action in that book, at least), this continuation was still interesting and I felt compelled to explore her life as she tries to survive Europe and visits to Iran. (I;d write more, but I\"m exhausted right now... how sad!). I'm glad I have the 1 & 2 of this book as two separate books, since now they are selling them bound together. The first one I may keep indefinitely. The second I would consider selling or loaning out for awhile. ...more The second book jumped around worse than the first. I felt like I was missing huge chunks with the story that she was telling, and it made it hard for me to track from time to time. Again, my favorite parts were more when she was at home with her family, mainly when she was discoursing about the important Islamic topic of veiling, and what right does a government have to tell you what's modest/immodest. I didn't end up liking this book as much as Persepolis 1 , but I'm not exactly sure why. The story picks up the narrative of the first one, and I had to wonder how a reader\u2019s encounter with Persepolis 2 would be without having read the first. The book marks Marji's unhappy time in Austria, her return to Iran, and her departure from Iran, mirroring the first book. It is a coming-of-age tale of adolescence into young adult hood. Satrapi\u2019s skill as a graphic novelist is astonishing. Her ability to I didn't end up liking this book as much as Persepolis 1 , but I'm not exactly sure why.

The descriptions of the body\u2019s awkward physical changes in the teen years, and of meeting her roommate Lucia made me laugh out loud because of the way they captured the scenes so appropriately and in such a relatable fashion. The book turns on some heavy themes, such as the narrator\u2019s experience of alienation in Austria, the romanticization of a homeland lost, and ways of adapting to changing cultural mores and constant war. I admire Satarpi\u2019s depictions of moments of shame, actions that I think most people would deny (like having an innocent person arrested) or avoid thinking about. This gives the book a sense of raw authenticity and accountability. It is a book that I think will stay with me for quite a while, and I mentally sort through the various issues it raised. ...more Wonderful sequel. Persepolis 2 was as incredible as the first book - I am so glad this series fell into my lap. This second novel follows Marjane through her years as a refugee in Austria and her return a few years later. Satrapi beautifully captured how it feels to be an outcast both abroad and at home.

Sayang banget anak yang cerdas dan penuh bakat ini harus melewati banyak kesalahan sebelum akhirnya menemukan jalannya. pelajaran yang saya tarik dari novel grafis ini: Semakin percaya bahwa agama memang sangat penting bagi kehidupan kita, selama tidak dihubungkan dengan politik dan kekuasaan. Dan rasanya jadi makin bersyukur jadi orang Indonesia dan hidup di Indonesia... We can only feel sorry for ourselves when our misfortunes are still supportable\u2026 once this limit is crossed, the only way to bear the unbearable is to laugh at it. The story of this woman is so deeply touching, there are no words to describe it. Wonderful. Just as brilliant as the first one. I now find myself wanting to read everything from this amazing lady. If you're looking for a super enjoyable graphic memoir/series then Persepolis is definitely something to look at! The first book was touching and memorable. In the second one, adolescent Marjane just got on my nerves. However, I did appreciate the episodes with her grandmother.<---C>Marjane Satrapi</---C><+++>Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return</+++>", "Title": "Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return"},
