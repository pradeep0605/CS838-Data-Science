{"Comments": "<+++>Dominion</+++>This book was awesome... which is exactly what I would think anyway because I wrote it and I want others to give it a shot and hope they agree. Priced low so you won't be out much for giving it a try. A surprisingly good read! Complicated enough to be considered hard sci-fi but written in a way anyone can understand. Great character development and they draw you in to the stories of their fight to escape a planet by using an ancient colony ship. Only Hawke knows anything of the technology inside the ship, but he can't get it operational again on his own. He must employ several people who might as well be from the 1800's in comparison.<---F> Highly recommended</---F>. Well told story I enjoy a well told story which this is. However I've never been a fan of the degenerating knowledge base scenario. With hundreds or thousands of people I believe education would rule. The advantages of tech world be so,,, rewarding. This book was great, right up until the last couple chapters. At that point, the author seems to have gotten stuck on the word hollered. Seriously? How many times can the various folks on the bridge holler something, especially when the came out of the jump,<---M> and everything was silent</---M>, yet they still felt the need to holler? Not yell, expostulate, exclaim, shout or raise their voice over the din, but holler? and not just once, but several times in a row.

Not yell, expostulate, exclaim, shout or raise their voice over the din, but holler? and not just once, but several times in a row. I know it's the end of the book, and you're getting tired of finding alternatives, but seriously man, that's what a thesaurus is for, after reading someone hollered for the 8th or 9th time, it got so irritating, I almost stopped reading, despite the fact that it was the last couple chapters. I saw evidence of this in vestage too, but not to the same extent. If it wasn't for this extremely irritating quirk, dominion would probably still hav gotten a 4 star rating, but at least I wouldn't have to complain about it in the review. :) Otherwise, an excellent story, pretty well told, and it definitely held my attention. Some issues were glaringno-nos, such as the hole in the gymn which caused no trouble at all when they were in space, but besides these (fortunately) rare fopas, I'd actually recomend this book to scifi fans, it was well done, if not masterfuly so, and it's a definite enjoyment if you have a few hours to kill. ...more While I quite enjoy <---A>Scott</---A>'s books, my only issue with them is that they seem to move quickly and end abruptly. I would love to see one of his stories go into greater detail and length. Overall, it was an easy read with an intriguing story. Fun quick read! Great book. For once the characters treat each other well and even the protagonists are reasonable. Terrific science fiction to consider. I do love Scott and all his books. This was a great book, although I did find the ending didn't go as I imagined, it was still a great read and I still highly recommend this book! Awesome read I love this book because it brought to the table what most other novels have not. This idea that the we are the advance race is what made this read so interesting. Great new perspective on the future of space travel and terraforming. Better than most indy books I've read. Characters are well fleshed out and keeps the reader engrossed until the end.<---C>Scott McElhaney</---C><+++>Dominion</+++>", "Title": "Dominion"},
