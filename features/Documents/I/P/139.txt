The sentiment was mostly along the lines of \"Pat Rothfuss is the next Scott Lynch!\" Here's the thing, Lies of Lock Lamora had come out almost exactly a year before my first book, The Name of the Wind. It was Scott's first book, the first in a fantasy series. The world was gritty and real, and it had knocked everyone over with how good it was. So I knew it was a flattering comparison, but at the time, I was kinda irked by it. I remember thinking, \"Why do I have to be the next Scott Lynch? Why can't I just be the first Pat Rothfuss? I'll probably be a lot better at that, I've got way more experience at it if nothing else....\" Years later I finally got around to reading Lies and enjoyed it. I saw that it was a clever book, and gritty, with a cool world. And there was an orphan boy in it who was a witty, mouthy thief. A while after that, I met Scott and really liked him as well. So I let go of what little residual irritation I had, not that there was very much...<---F> Fast forward to now</---F>. This last week I started re-reading Lies, and I was absolutely fucking *stunned* by how good it is. The construction of it. The language. The world. The cleverness. The wit. There is nothing I don't like in this book. Seriously. Okay. Fine. One tiny *tiny* quibble. Even so, do you know how rare it is for me to say that? Right now, in the full flush of this second reading, I think Lies is probably in e in my top ten favorite books ever. Maybe my top five. It's not really fair to compare the two books. They're different styles. Different subjects. Different worlds. That said, here's the things that The Lies of <---C>Locke Lamora</---C> does better than The Name of the Wind. 1. The beginning of his book is stronger than mine. Seriously. 50 pages into my book, you'll have reached the point where someone is starting to actually tell a story. 50 pages into Lies, you know the main character and are halfway into a fucking heist. 2. His title is better than mine. Don't get me wrong. The Name of the Wind is a good title, it's the *right* title for my book. But \"The Lies of Lock Lamora\" that's a faboo title right there. And his series title is better than mine too. \"Gentleman Bastard\" beats \"Kingkiller Chronicles\" hands-down. 3. His cussing is better than mine. Not in real life. In real life I cuss like a sailor. But the language in my books is pretty genteel and tame. In Lies, Lynch's low-life street thugs are vulgarian virtuosos. This might seem like a little thing, but it's not. It builds the world. It shows character. It helps make the story feel truly, perfectly grubby and real. Here it is in a nutshell: When I was first published, I was irritated when people compared me to Scott Lynch. Only now do I realize how huge a compliment I was being given. If you haven't read it, you should. If you have read it, you should probably read it again.... ...more Ocean's Eleven was great and everything, but know what would've made it cooler? If the setting had been during the late middle ages, possibly the Renaissance. Better yet, a fantasy world version of the Renaissance with an intricate system of magic and a complex set of political conspiracies to add some flair. And what if the city was built upon the ruins of an earlier city, and the earlier city was built by some enigmatic science fiction creatures that have since disappeared?

Better yet, a fantasy world version of the Renaissance with an intricate system of magic and a complex set of political conspiracies to add some flair. And what if the city was built upon the ruins of an earlier city, and the earlier city was built by some enigmatic science fiction creatures that have since disappeared? And if instead of a handsome, tepid and understated George Clooney in the lead, we had a short guy who can't swordfight a whit, and has a bit of an anger management issue? And he drops unexpected one-liners that make you literally laugh out loud while you're in the breakroom at work and suddenly everyone is looking at you like you're psycho? What if the character went to the Mel Gibson school of Masochism, requiring he gets beat to a bloody pulp and stabbed and drowned in horse urine...oh, I don't know....several times per story arc? How about this character (<---B>we'll call him Locke</---B>) is absolutely fallible and occasionally screws up on a cosmic level? The kind of screw-up that would get someone less clever killed in mere seconds? And what if, improbably, this protagonist somehow escapes and still--in a manner of speaking--wins? That sounds like fun. But, it COULD end up a little predictable. So, the author should be a recent graduate of the George R R Martin School of Bumping Off Prominent Characters (Yes, these schools do exist). And the con game Locke is building should hit tons of snags that continue raising the stakes and drawing in new, more dangerous characters, increasing the risk until you just can't stop reading even to put out house fires for the last couple hundred pages. And then, when somehow the Gentlemen Bastards emerge on the other side, coated in their own blood and the blood of others, triumphant, you put the book down and say \"Wow.\" Furthermore! How about, even though the book is the first book in a ridiculously long series, this hypothetical book is a complete story! (For those of you who read a lot of Very Long Fantasy Serieses, this may be a foreign concept. It may help to wiki the words \"climax\" and \"resolution.\") When you finish this one, you aren't forced to keep reading in order to find out how the conflict is resolved. You actually know. That sounds pretty cool. Well, it is cool. It is witty, profane, violent, over the top, and frequently hilarious. I can't believe this is Scott Lynch's first novel, and I can't wait to read more. This is an incredibly fun adventure novel. Find yourself a copy and read it. ...more <+++>The Lies of Locke Lamora</+++> is a love child of Ocean's Eleven and The Godfather .

It gleefully takes the f-bombs and casually throws them around. But, as the author has mentioned before, foul language is the least issue of this book full of violence, blood, and drowning in horse piss. Regardless, consider yourselves warned. ------------------------------------------------------------ Add the above together, and you have Camorr. A lovely place to raise children. ------------------------------------------------------------- Locke Lamora, our lovable antihero, would like you to believe he's nothing more than a petty thief. Well, not so much. He is the Thorn of Camorr , puling one heist after another on the unsuspecting, secure in their birth nobles of his medieval Venice-like city. Until one day he gets in way over his head. There are plenty of people who would love to see him dead - if they could ever figure out who the hell he is. \"There\u2019s no freedom quite like the freedom of being constantly underestimated.\" Locke Lamora is a Gentleman Bastard who doesn't care much about becoming rich. So why does he steal on a truly grandiose scale? Of course, \"because it's heaps of fucking fun.\" And because he is not a fan of nobles feeling invincible just because they are nobles. He loves being a Thorn in their side and giving them the taste of their own medicine. \"Sometimes I think this whole city was put here simply because the gods must adore crime. Pickpockets rob the common folk, merchants rob anyone they can dupe, Capa Barsavi robs the robbers and the common folk, the lesser nobles rob nearly everyone, and Duke Nicovante occasionally runs off with his army and robs the shit out of Tal Verarr or Jerem, not to mention what he does to his own nobles and his common folk.\u201d Locke is a proverbial smartass. He is stubborn, clever, and disrespectful. Basically, he has a knack for attracting trouble. After all, someone has already paid for his death before Locke even turned eight. He is not so great with weapons - unless you count wits, sheer tenacity, and enormous disrespect for authority. What he IS great with is friendship. He gets by with a little help from his friends , so to say. \u201cI don't have to beat you. I don't have to beat you, motherfucker. I just have to keep you here... until Jean shows up.\u201d Locke Lamora has only one BERSERK BUTTON (unless you also count a certain redhead) - DO.NOT.MESS.WITH.HIS.FRIENDS. Seriously, you don't want Locke Lamora pissed at you. (view spoiler) [Just ask the Gray King. (hide spoiler) ] And that's what I really adored about this book - the depiction of honest, strong friendships between Locke and his gang. Formerly a bunch of misfits, they have formed strong bonds of friendship that will only be broken by death. They always have each other's back, no matter what the situation is. Locke and Jean Tannen have the best bromance ever since Joey and Chandler or Turk and JD. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- I loved this book - so much I want to have grandbabies with it. It's a fun, fast-paced, skillfully written, smart and snarky but surprisingly touching read that had me laughing and shaking my fist in anger within a few pages. Easy 5 stars for the enjoyable ride. \u201cI can't wait to have words with the Gray King when this shit is all finished,\" Locke whispered. \"There's a few things I want to ask him.

Immediately I liked the writing, which combines wit with solid prose. Like my wife I hit a bit of a soft patch early on, though for me it was that I was finding the point of view very 'surface' sharing almost nothing of Locke's thoughts or desires, leaving him a bit of a blank. Lots of fantasy fans quite like a blank to project themselves onto - but I'm not one of them. Fortunately Locke's personality continued to develop and the point of view seemed to settle a little deeper into him as things progressed. The real strengths of the book are the plotting, the dialogue, and the atmosphere. The dialogue (banter) brings the Gentlemen Bastards to life, the plotting keeps the reader on their toes, and the city is very well imagined. I was surprised to find that the light-hearted tone (set primarily by the banter between Locke's gang) actually allows a slew of quite dark themes/scenes to slide past with less impact than they might have. The child prostitution, the gruesome torture scenes, and the mutilation dealt out by our hero are all absent in my own d\u00e9but which is often called out for being very dark. In any event, I found it to be a rewarding read, well written, and entertaining. I'd recommend any fantasy fan to give it a try. ...more Lynch introduces us to a gang of intelligent, flamboyant and charismatic thieves called the Gentleman Bastards around whom this book (and I assume the entire series) revolves.

Locke - the infamous Thorn of Camorr, Jean and Bug were my personal favourites within the group but the camaraderie presented surrounding the gang was amazing - almost making us as the reader feel part of the ensemble - as we were privy to the cons, the secrets and also the stories revolving the characters youths. Lynch presents his chapters in a way that shows two timelines. Typically a chronologic present day portrayal of what the Gentleman Bastards are doing in Camorr's underworld and then various origin stories such as Locke's induction to the group and Jean's training at weaponry. The origin stories usually feed quite nicely into what then takes place in the current day or explain part of the world/ cultural references. It is majorly written third person focusing on Locke but it does flip and switch between following a handful of other characters too. It took me a while to get in to initially as we are thrown straight into the world which has numerous races, religions and underworld hierarchy but after about 30-40 I was under the spell. Some of the cons are mesmerising. I remember numerous times when I thought that the con couldn't get any more complex or multi-layered it did and I was left in awe. It consists of a colourful supporting cast including some of the Capa's (gang leaders), Father Chains and the Grey King. It has quite a few shocking moments where some characters are killed off. It is a pretty gruesome world and a few deaths and scenes of torture made me go wow - pretty grim. The ending was very rewarding and I cannot wait to start reading Red Seas Under Red Skies. I think most of my friends on Goodreads have read this but if you haven't then I truly recommend it.

(Pun intended) Come, come right this way............. This book is exactly what you're looking for, IF you're looking for a fantasy riddled, ruthless, enigmatic piece of art. This book was that, and so much more. This book is around 700 pages with apt descriptions and precise detailing. It revolves around an orphan thief (because that's the best kind), whose world is changed when a plague riddled village is left with its only unaffected survivors. Based on the synopsis and the limited knowledge I had of this book before I picked it up, I assumed locke's thieving life will begin after he is taken into the custody of the thief lord, but boy was I mistaken. Locke is the story of a boy who has long before the story begins, been selected or better yet said; chosen for a life as a thief. Ironically a decent thief. You see the reason this book deserves praise isn't the fastidious writing or plotting, it's the way the author has taken a heinous act such as stealing and transformed it into an art, and better yet made us absolutely love the so called artist. Its a mixture of tragic circumstances and incredible wit, with a touch of unbidden morality that makes his protagonist who he is. I guess it's always the way one person stands out as extraordinary that makes heads turn their way, and emotions ebb and flow. But perhaps my favorite thing was the fact that he wasn't invincible, he was smart, but not impossibly so. I guess I just fell in love with Locke from the beginning, he was just so imperfectly perfect. There is a renown sense of honesty to him, making him lovable. The book moves back and forth, between different events in different settings and time spans. Keeping up with the flow proved to be a little difficult at first, because of all the names and places and people, and this jumping from here to there didn't help much either. But truly once you get into the flow of the book, which takes about 50 or so pages, you just sink, and keep going deeper and deeper. I personally adored the touches from locke's childhood and his learning, but it wasn't just about him. The book has a way of keeping you guessing, not just about what happens next, but also about who plays what role, and who truly matters. Although I give fair warning, this books is no happily ever after, and definitely not romance riddled. There are characters mentioned all through out, but have yet to be introduced, I personally want to meet locke's lost love sooner rather than later, but that has yet to happen. Like I said before, the book doesn't revolve solely around one person, regardless of the fact that he is the main protagonist. Some parts shocked me to the core, and way too many characters were lost is a short span. Nascza was my first stab to the gut, then came bug, the twin priests, and all the others that just kept adding to the pile. I particularly mourned Bug. That was so not okay Mr.lynch, so not okay! But regardless of the gut stabbing pain, the book was a thrill, and excellently written. It was my first time reading anything of lynchs work, and I dare say I was impressed. Although his vividly descriptive writing takes some getting used to. Can wait to read the second book!!! ...more 2.5 stars...maybe a full 3?

It felt like years went by while I tried to get to The Good Stuff. I know that a lot of you love books that give detailed descriptions of the character's surroundings. I know, I know, I know! Please, for the love of God, don't spam my review thread with your comments on how I just don't understand the beauty of the lush world Lynch built . I most certainly do understand, but I don't enjoy reading about what material a character's coat is made out of unless it will somehow be relevant later on in the story. Here's my rule on this sort of thing: Unless the fact that the gently swaying purple flower's fragrance made WhoTheFuckEver do/say/remember something important that will move the plot forward? Well, then I don't even need to know that there was a fucking purple flower! And, yes , I do like the world I'm reading about to feel complete and real, but there's only so much I can (personally) take. This book tested my patience. There was so much...just irrelevant crap on every page that I started skimming in earnest by the 50% mark. I hate skimming, because I always think I'm going to miss something, but I had to do it, or I never would have finished. Another thing that bothered me were all the fucking flashbacks. Because EVERY TIME shit would start to get interesting, you'd have to go back and read about their childhoods. That would have been fine, if all of these flashbacks were interesting. They weren't. It was a 50/50 split between relevant stories of their past, and boring bullshit filler that had a speck of pertinent information. So. The core of story is clever, funny, charming, heart-wrenching, and fun...once you scrape away about half of the words. I mean, the plot would easily have made this a 5 star book for me. EASILY! It's well-written, it's lovely, it made me feel things! But when I went to request the next book, I found myself sort of shuddering at the thought of slogging through any more of these guys' adventures. I'm not the kind of reader who can truly enjoy this kind of book, but maybe you are? There are lots of glowing reviews for this one, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. ...more It's not often I read a book that makes me forget I'm a writer too. This one succeeded, madly.

That\u2019s because the ancient city of Camorr is infested with thieves, pickpockets, schemers and violent gang leaders. But, the worse of the bunch is the priests. Father Chains is a priest and his money making scheme is as brilliant as it is conniving. He hides behind a false religion and has created a fake temple to its worship. He pretends to be a prophet; thus, he rakes in a considerable income in tithes. He keeps the money for himself, and lives in luxury. To add insult to injury he also pretends to be blind, which further increases sympathy for himself and weighs down his pockets more so. Chains becomes Locke\u2019s mentor. Suffice to say, he has learnt from the best thief of the age. He was raised to be a thief Locke Lamora (sounds good to say doesn\u2019t it) is a young prodigy out to steal the world; he is ambitious and clever, strong and resourceful, and he has set his mind to a heist that will topple all those that came before it. He is the leader of Chain\u2019s Gentleman Bastards, which is a thief syndicate that uses every tool available. These include things from a simple cutpurse job to blending in with the nobility. They were all raised by Chains; they are all master thieves, and the heist they attempt is bigger than the dreams any common thief. Well, you know what they say about those that fly too high: they end up in a sticky mess. The Gentleman Bastards certainly achieved that. During their scheming they crossed paths with someone rather ominous, someone who wishes to use them in his revenge field mission against the entire city of Camoor. He has discovered the plans of Locke and friends and is using it to manipulate them to help in his blood soaked quest. Woe to Locke Lamora for this man has hired the help of someone rather dangerous: a feared bondsmage. Some great action The result is one big bloody mess that the author has thoughtfully devised. He has written in very well too, for the most part, although there are a few moments when his prose goes overboard. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he describes some things with real eloquent detail, but others are just in too much depth. I remember reading a paragraph long description of a barrel of ale at one point. This was completely unnecessary. However, when these in depth description are applied to a combat scene the result is fantastic. This is my only criticism for the novel, and if they were toned a little I would have enjoyed the book a little more. Overall, this is a great fantasy novel that is unlike any others I\u2019ve read. This is always good because the genre can be littered with books that simply follow the standard fantasy archetype, which results in repetitive story telling. This isn\u2019t necessarily bad, but can become boring after a while. Therefore, the plot of this is fresh, exciting and completely new.

Set in a freaky, mystical alternate Renaissance Venice, the story takes place amongst the underworld thieves and gangs of the city. Our protagonist (I definitely won't call him a hero), Locke Lamora, and his title implied lies, guide us through a twisted, involved, and incredibly fucking fun (as they would say themselves) plotline that bounces all over the place back and forth and winds to its improbable and yet not unbelievable conclusion. There's thieving, impersonating identities, lots and lots of lies (some well done, others less so), very creative swearing that often made me laugh out loud, gang fights, plenty of gore, and all the intrigue, politics and sweet sweet revenge you could possibly want. And even amongst all this filth and twisted dirtiness, it still manages to be about love and revenge and wonderful, awesome friendship. I loved how this book went right through and around genre expectations. Our protagonist Locke Lamora is not good looking, he isn't at all good in a fight, and we get to watch him be impotent in bed, an arrogant little snit who gets slapped down several times, and taking very very petty, not noble revenge on a bunch of people. He's just really smart. But realistically so. Sometimes even his spectacular ability to lie fails, and he has to go to Plan B. Sometimes Plan C. Sometimes Plan Z, until he's at the end of his tether, before he finally catches a break- and by that point he might be black and blue and humiliated and mutilated in a lot of nasty ways that don't usually get to happen to a hero. They also make no bones about the fact that he is a thief, and not in any Robin Hood sense at all, and no, there is no secret noble quest underneath that. Just deal with it. Scott Lynch is also not afraid to kill people. Nobody is safe in this book, and you geniunely believe that anyone left alive could die on the next page by a random unlucky strike to the back of the head from a penny dropped from a height. He also is not close minded in his plots. He has created an incredible world, and he involves that world in the plot. Sometimes things go awry just... 'cause. Not everyone in the city is part of their plot. Stuff happens. I love that as well. His world creation is absolutely incredible, by the way. No, not by the way. That's a main point. He's meticulous in detail, and yet not boring with it. He spent five pages describing an alien glass garden of roses and I was riveted- I thought it was some of the best pages of the book. He's a skilled storyteller, and his descriptions are just a part of that. He's able to keep things at a very brisk pace and indulge us all the while building his plot and enriching the background. I read this in four days. I give this book four stars just 'cause I'm stingy with the five stars, but it is really a five star book for the fantasy genre, it absolutely is. ...more THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH STARS IN THE SKY TO ACCURATELY SUM UP MY LOVE FOR THIS BOOK.

I could totally SEE Camora (shh, I have no idea how to spell it!? audiobook remember) and I loved the intense details that just brought the place to life. And Locke is, no joke, the BEST character of my life. He was simultaneously clever, witty and capable...and also like a pathetic little thin child who got into very terrible danger and needed to be rescued constantly by Jean. I CANNOT LOVE LOCKE ENOUGH. He sassed at all the wrong times. Like, dude, you are getting your face beaten in SHUT UP. But no. \u201cI cut off his fingers to get him to talk, and when he'd confessed everything I wanted to hear, I had his fucking tongue cut out, and the stump cauterized.\" Everyone in the room stared at him. \"I called him an asshole, too,\" said Locke. \"He didn't like that.\u201d He also needs Jean so bad and their friendship is actual goals . I mean, Jean would cross oceans and kill a thousand sharks and fly to the moon and back and be nearly murdered -- AND HE'D STILL COME AND SAVE LOCKE. Whereas Locke gets beaten up and he just lies in the dirt until Jean saves him. #precious Not to mention all the other Gentlemen Bastards. I loooved the twins, Carlo and Galdo (heaven help me with the spelling??) who finished each other's sentences and were clever and hilarious at ALL TIMES. And Bug was the 12 year old apprentice and he was adorable and stupid and therefore a perfect Gentlemen Bastard. (That's the name of their con group by the way.) AND THEY WERE ALL LIKE BROTHERS AND LIKE FAMILY AND I LOVED THEM. The plot was obviously A+. Because it was so clever . There are dozens of cons and small subplots that just wrap into each other PERFECTLY by the end that I was sitting there like a drowned avocado saying \"why can't I write like this\". And my feels? HAHAHAH WHAT FEELS. They've been mangled. I don't even know how to fix them. Duct tape? I'm gonna need duct tape. I CAN'T EVEN GET OVER HOW MUCH I LOVE LOCKE THOUGH. Perfect little arrogant and cocky and twitchy and absolutely in-over-his-head-at-all-times little mite. I have such a weakness for thieves and sass and I got BOTH in GREAT ABUNDANCE here and I'm in love. Also crying but whatever. And I have such a book hangover... YES it's a thing. I have the sequel on library reserve but IT'S NOT IN MY HANDS RIGHT. THIS. MINUTE. Ergo I am dyyyyyying. It only took one book, but I'm successfully Locke Lamora trash and I'm not even ashamed. I'm just, like, SCREAMING because it was so so so so freakishly good. It was everything I want in a book. I THINK I'M SUFFOCATING WITH ADORATION RIGHT NOW. \u201cYou've got that motherly concern in your eyes, Jean. I must look like I'm hammered as shit,\" said Locke. \"Actually you look like you were executed last week.\u201d ...more 5 Holy shit what did I just read Stars.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \u275dI only steal because it\u2019s heaps of fucking fun!\u275e \"You can\u2019t be serious.

This was my first time reading anything by Scott Lynch and I'm really impressed, he is a fantastic author and extremely talented. I'm so glad I picked up this book. I enjoyed it from page one, although I must admit it took me over 100 pages to understand what was going on, this story is written in past & present, so the chapters can be really confusing at the beginning. After getting used to Scotts writing style I was blown away, I feel like it's nearly impossible to pull off a book with past & present chapters especially when it jumps around a lot, but Scott Lynch managed pulled it off. The plot is slow paced but builds up to a massive story, normally not my cup of tea because it doesn't have much violence or magic in the plot but still the definition of badassery! Oceans Eleven meets The Bank Job meets Mistborn. Seriously this book was so much fun to read. I love gangsters and I love criminals so with the complex plot, this book was a 10/10. \u201cHard lessons were handed out. As many men learned to their sorrow, it\u2019s impossible to be intimidating when one angry woman has your cock between her teeth and another is holding a stiletto to your kidneys.\u201d This book is on my favourite shelf and in my top five favourite books ever. I literally loved reading it. I was so captivated by the plot & the characters. I read some of the reviews for this book and saw a lot of people complaining about the amount of swearing.... The swearing made it hilarious and I loved it so much. Scott Lynch literally swears in every sentence (just like me haha). I can't remember ever laughing so much in a fantasy book. Only had one issue it felt really long, like some description went on and on, some also weren't necessary at all. Yes Scott Lynch is a beautiful and interesting world builder, however some parts just went over the top, I did skim a lot of descriptions, except characters and important scenes. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever heard that one before? Your Capa Barsavi, he\u2019s not from Camorr, originally. Taught at the Therin Collegium. So, when he drags someone in for a talking-to, that\u2019s \u2018etiquette lessons.\u2019 And when he ties them up and makes them talk, that\u2019s \u2018singing lessons.\u2019 And when he cuts their throats and throws them in the bay for the sharks\u2026\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Jean, \u201cI guess that\u2019d be teeth lessons. I get it.\u201d So basically this book is about gangs, there are all different gangs and they are all under one leader the Capa, the gangs each have a leader but the leaders work under the Capa and must pay him to keep their gangs running. The story follows a gang called the gentlemans bastards, all members are orphans and are all trained to be gentleman & the best theifs around. Our main character Locke is a professional liar & the story follows him and his childhood. I absolutely adore Locke, he is everything I look for in a character he is badass, a liar, a criminal & a thief but he is also such a gentleman (swoon worthy). So basically Locke and his gang try to pull off one of the biggest thievery jobs ever, however it doesn't go to plan and their is a new gang boss on the scene thirsty for revenge. \u201cA manifestation straight from the ass of a magnificent liar,\u201d I literally adored all characters in this book and cried a few times at the brutality they go through. The Bromance between Locke and Jean had me. It was so genuine. I think most of my favourite parts where from Jeans POV I loved his training, I loved when he chose his weapons (the sisters) and I loved a certain battle towards the end with him vs two people. It was so badass and Jean is my precious. \u201c\u2026 and this is the card you picked. The six of spires,\u201d said Calo, holding up a card and displaying it for the entrance-hall guards. \u201cFuck me,\u201d said one of them, \u201cthat\u2019s sorcery.\u201d \u201cNah, it\u2019s just the old Sanza touch.\u201d I recommend this book to all fantasy lovers and also people who like Mafia books with a twist. I think this book would be a great introduction for anyone wanting to start reading fantasy. P.S. When I grow up I want to be in the gentlemen's bastards. \u201cChains used to claim that there\u2019s no freedom quite like the freedom of being constantly underestimated,\u201d said Locke. \u201cGods, yes.\u201d Calo rolled his eyes and stuck out his tongue. \u201cIf we were any freer we\u2019d float away into the sky and fly like the birds.\u201d ...more \u25ba BR with the BBB gang starting January 11, 2016. \u2620 DNF at 31% \u2620 Warning: I pretty much have nothing to say about this book.

Which means I read about 230 pages of this Delightful Piece of Fast-Paced Awesomeness (DPFPA\u2122). Which means I should have something to tell you about it. But I don't. Because nothing happened. Apart from a bunch of thieves planning some kind of con-type thing. Is that vague enough for you? Good. Now don't ask me what kind of con-type thing it was, because after 230 pages, I still freaking haven't a freaking clue . It's got to do something with some fascinating noble guy named Don Lorenzo Salvara. And that's pretty much all I know about it. Why? Because the author was so busy drowning his main plot in irrelevant crap that he forgot he had an actual story to tell. But I wouldn't want to be completely unfair here (and as you all know, I am fairness incarnate), so I will admit that yes, one thing did happen . I know you don't believe me, but I swear it's the truth. Want to know what happened? Lamora got on a boat. Yep, that's right. I know it's a lot to take, but please try and refrain from fainting . Have you recovered? I hope so, because I just remembered something else happened. No no no, don't pass out again! Stay with me! Just take a few deep breaths and it will be alright. Feel better? Phew, that was close. So, \"what else happened,\" you ask? Some gladiator-type chick got eaten by some sharks . Yeah, that was pretty cool. I enjoyed every single second of that scene. That scene was amazing. Think of it as 5 glorious seconds of utter awesomeness. Scott Lynch, you overachiever . 5 whole seconds! This is just too much. You shouldn't overexert yourself like this, I'm pretty sure it's hazardous to your health . Come to think of it, I shouldn't worry about you. I mean, 98% of this book 31% of this book is filler BS, adorned with Agonizingly Interminable Descriptions from Inferno (AIDI\u2122) and enhanced with Excruciatingly Detailed Prose from Hell (EDPH\u2122). Yep, that's right, excitement is me \u2622 sarcasm alert \u2622 And that is all. I have nothing else to say about this book. BUT. I'd hate to see you go so soon, so I shall (very generously, I might add) share my Delightful Lamora Reading Experience (DLRE\u2122) with you. I suffered through 31% of this, there's no reason why you shouldn't suffer through this review as well. Please don't thank me, I'm generous like that. \u00bb So. When I first read the blurb for this book, I was all : Which loosely translates to: OMG this sounds so cool, I should buddy read it with my Silly Friends of Despicable Book Taste (view spoiler) [I love you too (hide spoiler) ] !!!! \u00bb Then I very happily and very naively started reading . And this happened: blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim.

That just goes to show how faithful they are to the author's style). Okay, so I have to admit that in the middle of all this blah-blah-blah-ing and skim-skim-skimming, this sometimes happened : ha ha ha ha ha, great dialogue, ha ha ha ha ha, great dialogue, ha ha ha ha ha, great dialogue, ha ha ha ha ha, great dialogue, ha ha ha ha ha, great dialogue. But I'm afraid Lynch's 5-second rule applies here as well. So we were back in blah blah blah, skim skim skim land in less time than it takes to blink . Oh, no need to remind Mr Lynch about that. Believe me, HE KNOWS. Blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim. REPEAT. REPEAT. REPEAT. \u00bb And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how I ended up DNFing this thrilling piece of captivating literature . Oh believe me, I know I read it all wrong, blah blah blah, skim skim skim and all that crap. Well let me tell you something: if some of my dear friends hadn't waited for me to DNF this to tell me the first half of the book was boring as hell (you don't say?!) but that the second half was awesome , maybe I would have kept on reading. And maybe, just maybe, I would be ooh-ing and aah-ing about this right now \u2190 you don't really believe any of this, do you? Oh good, you scared me there for a second. I mean boring crap is boring crap, no matter how you look at it. \u25ba\u25ba And the moral of this non-review is : hey, I think I've just achieved something here! I think I just wrote a blah blah blah, skim skim skim review! Damn, I can be so gifted sometimes.

What a nice coincidence stumbling into you here on this expression of thought. Odd chance, you say? Well, I have to be honest with you. I actually planned this for quite a while. I'm playing the long con game with this review. I set up a profile on this site, joined some groups and build a network of friends. And all leads up to today's review. So, I kind of tricked you to lay eyes on these lines of lies. All that I learned from my days with the Gentleman Bastards Hello, distinguished review reader. What a nice coincidence stumbling into you here on this expression of thought. Odd chance, you say? Well, I have to be honest with you. I actually planned this for quite a while. I'm playing the long con game with this review. I set up a profile on this site, joined some groups and build a network of friends. And all leads up to today's review. So, I kind of tricked you to lay eyes on these lines of lies. All that I learned from my days with the Gentleman Bastards and their leader, Locke Lamorra. Do you happen to know him? You've probably met him already, but didn't recognize him, cause he was in costume. Maybe he already tricked you into giving him money. He's from the city of Camorr, a beautiful Venice like metropolis, where alchemical lights of all colors are reflected by the famous glass towers in the center of the city. Locke and his friends work their operation from a secret hideout in the bowels of an old temple. But don't bother trying to find it, you would never be able to enter it uninvited. A while back, Locke told me about the Salvara game he and the boys had planned. This would bring in a huge amount of money for the gang, but it wouldn't be the helluva story it is, if all the plans would just work out perfectly. Complications arise everywhere and the Gentleman Bastards are suddenly in all kinds of troubles. What I like about Locke is that, when he tells a story, he tells the whole story. After every part, he illustrates some aspect of the story by giving you a relevant glimpse into his past or Camorr's history. So, long story short, I decided to sign up with the bastards to trick more readers into visting their world. See how they reacted: \"I write reviews, cause my train of thoughts after reading a novel can't stay in the station,\" said Calo. \"Liar!\" \"I write reviews to impress the ladies with my insight and cleverness!\" said Galdo. \"Liar!\" \"I write reviews to get children to read again,\" said Jean. \"Liar!\" \"I write reviews to trick readers into spending money on books,\" said Locke. \"Liar!\" \"I write reviews, cause I want people to hit the Like button,\" I said. \"Bastard!\" ...more Another great fantasy, this novel follows a talented rogue and conman, Locke Lamora, through his adventures in Camorr, a city loosely patterned after Venice, but set in a world where humans have built their society over the ruins of a much older race called the Eldren.

Lynch\u2019s world is so vivid and fully formed that the reader feels as if he\u2019s been dropped into the crowded bazaar in an exotic city and left to find his way out. At first, this can be overwhelming. Everything is different: the days of the week, the gods, the geography, the slang. On top of this, Lynch jumps back and forth in time from Locke Lamora\u2019s past to his present. I confess I got bogged down at the beginning and had to come back to this book several months later. But if you keep going, the payoff is well worth the effort. Give it a hundred pages, and you\u2019ll be hooked. If you like intelligent funny dialogue, clever protagonists facing equally clever antagonists, and vivid original world building, Scott Lynch is your guy. When I got to the end, I immediately ordered the next two books in this series. ...more Locke: \u201cI only steal because my dear old family needs the money to live!\" \"LIAR!\" Calo: \"I only steal because this wicked world won't let me work an honest trade!\" \"LIAR!\" Galdo: \"I only steal because i have to support my poor lazy brother.\" \"LIAR!\" Jean: \"I only steal because I've temporarily fallen in with bad company.\" \"LIAR!\" Bug: \"I only steal because it's heaps of fucking fun!\" \"BASTARD!\u201d this was a wonderful, wonderful experience. it is hard to give a specific rationale for why i loved this book - there are so many reasons! it has adventure, flair, great characters, a robust narrative, a satisfying conclusion, is exceedingly clever and well-written, and just heaps of fun. it is a good-hearted book. terrible things do happen, but the book has at its core a love of humanity, of life, of loyalty, of kindness, of the ways that family can be created, of the ways that children can sur this was a wonderful, wonderful experience. it is hard to give a specific rationale for why i loved this book - there are so many reasons! it has adventure, flair, great characters, a robust narrative, a satisfying conclusion, is exceedingly clever and well-written, and just heaps of fun. it is a good-hearted book. terrible things do happen, but the book has at its core a love of humanity, of life, of loyalty, of kindness, of the ways that family can be created, of the ways that children can survive terrible things, of the ways that adults can live with their own kind of honor, even as thieves. strangely enough, there was no romance whatsoever. this was a pleasure to discover! i don't mind romance, when it is done well, but so often it bogs down books that are built on pure narrative - books like this one. no such bogging down occurs. although pretty dark at times, this is also a humorous novel, and i laughed out loud at a lot of the clever moments and at many of the one-liners. maybe not the most subtle use of humor, but i'll take a real laugh when i can get it. as a cynical old man, usually when i laugh out loud at a book, it is in derision. the world-building does not take precedence but it is there, and clearly thought out. i was slightly reminded of both tanith lee's Veniss (Venice by another name) and, strangely, Makkathran from the latest peter hamilton mega-opus. the city really comes alive at certain points. the novel is rich with details of the strangeness of Camorr. the parallels with Ocean's 11 have been made repeatedly, and i suppose it is there. there are also many obvious uses of mafia culture, venice as noted, and italy in general. but put all together, it felt original to me, less derivative and more of a pastiche than a parody. and really, confidence games are timeless. in my misguided excitement after finishing the last page, i started reading reviews on amazon and here in GR. i noticed something very irritating: people complaining about the frequent cursing and dropping of f-bombs. okay, now i can understand this if you are normally a fan of Regency romance or, say, classic adventure along the lines of rafael sabatini. or less violent fantasy in general. then i can understand the complaints and even respect them. but if you are a fan of rowdy modern adventure & fantasy, genres that frequently include blood & guts & murder & mutilation & slaughter....THEN GET A FUCKING GRIP ALREADY AND GET YOUR FUCKING PRIORITIES IN ORDER! my gosh, reading that kind of almost insanely unbalanced perspective really gets me agitated - you can read about humans being bloodily killed or tortured and yet the word FUCK gets your panties in a bunch? in a novel that depicts a city that hangs child thieves in public, it is swear words that really bother you? i hate to end a review of a book i loved on such a negative note, but i had to get that off of my chest. so i'll end the review like this: if you like adventure, read this book! it's awesome. ...more Buddy reading this with The Amazing Kainat! what to say that hasn't been said already?

but mostly\u2014 mostly \u2014it's the structure that got on my nerves. lynch can write. seriously! the man's got chops. but he chopped his story up, so that every time any dramatic tension or rising capery pleasure developed, it was chop! time for another fucking interlude about the ceremonial vestments of the priesthood of chekthelionassus and why they only wear breechclouts on the third day of grrbhlstnwyrsheddin. no, it's fine\u2014go ahead. i'll wait. it's more fun when you say it out loud anyway. i liked the arc, but would have liked it more if lynch hadn't been messing with it the entire time. for these reasons, and despite a more or less rousing finish only a leeeeetle bit diminished by firstbookitis, i find i can rate this no higher than a two. i thought it was pretty okay\u2014but still just okay. ...more 4.5 stars \"Locke Lamora's rule of thumb was this: a good confidence game took three months to plan, three weeks to rehearse, and three seconds to win or lose the victim's trust forever.\" Once upon a time, there was a girl who loved Six of Crows .

However, I think a much closer crime movie comparison would probably be The Usual Suspects because there comes a point when Locke and his friends are forced to do the bidding of a mysterious villain who wields tremendous power. Things take a darker turn from there with the kind of violence and body count that George Clooney and his pals never had to deal with.

The world building is excellent in the way that Camorr is fully realized in almost every detail including its politics, social classes, and religion as well as how its criminal underworld functions within a complicated set of rules. Characterization is particularly strong with Locke and his friends well developed via flashbacks that explains their history as well as giving readers the sense of the strong bond among them. Locke in particular is a great main character as a cocky con man, but I also liked that he\u2019s not your typical dashing rogue. He\u2019s small, not a big manly man, and he\u2019s not much good in a fight so having him have to use his wits rather than a sword is part of what makes him interesting. Author Scott Lynch also does a superior job of managing tone. While this starts out as a kind of bawdy romp, he doesn\u2019t hesitate to make things bloody and doesn\u2019t hedge the cost of these events, but he\u2019s able to keep the novel\u2019s original boastful spirit alive even as everything is going to hell without it feeling too jarring. The witty dialogue helps keep things from getting too dark, and it is so profane that it would make the characters in Deadwood blush. (Which is an extra bonus for me because I love colorful cursing.) Plus, Lynch balances the weird elements extremely well by doling out just enough magic and strange creatures to make this a fantasy novel without letting those things overwhelm or distract a reader. While it\u2019s a serious story filled with violence and deadly consequences, it never gets so bogged down in those aspects that it forgets to be entertaining. ...more Odli\u010dna, odli\u010dna knjiga.

The best way to describe this book is that is has a dam-breaking volume of pure, unadulterated People compare this book to the likes of The Godfather and Ocean's Eleven . I'll follow the pattern and compare the book to the grit and vulgarity of Goodfellas ! But such flattering associations notwithstanding, this book is undeniably unique and stands strong by itself. This book is an opus of careful planning and pure wit. The plot is labyrinthine, the prose has just as many twists and turns as the plot, the characters are grade-A smartasses with healthy helpings of charm and wit, and the violence has as much flair and color as a Camorri nobleman's pantyhose. The world of Locke Lamora is also as quirky and dangerous as the characters. Camorr, a Renaissance Venice-like city-state with a very Sicilian mindset, was the perfect backdrop for the novel. Baked in corruption and crime as well as ostentatious wealth, Camorr boasts great and glittering persons residing in their high towers as well as crooked thieves living in graveyards and fortress strongholds. The city is also encircled by canals filled with terrifying sea creatures as filthy as the polluted waters. Kind of like... ( This was my train of thought when Jean and Bug take a night's swim in the water (view spoiler) [after Locke got dunked in a barrel of horse piss (hide spoiler) ] . ) Serving as our bridge between these two worlds are the Gentlemen Bastards, a band of merry and brotherly thieves, who rob great sums exclusively from the wealthy. We first meet the main characters as they are planning a heist to relieve a nobleman of half his material wealth: newbie Bug who is eager to impress the Gentlemen Bastards more than steal bags of gold; the insatiable Sanza twins, jacks of all trades; strong and dependable Jean whose violent temper instills fear in the biggest and strongest men; and the brains behind all operations, Locke Lamora, swashbuckling trickster who doles out Oscar-worthy performances during his confidence games. Like Locke, each of these characters were incredibly fleshed out as unique individuals with their quirks and faults. The interludes that showed glimpses of Locke's and Jean's initiation as Gentlemen Bastards added much dimension to their overall development. Be warned that in Camorr cursing is as common as sharks (oh yes, I did say sharks ), and it is most definitely not PG-13 . But I can honestly say that vulgarity was never as melodious to my ears as it was in this novel. And the cursing is just kind of tossed around... in factual statements : \"There are only three people in life you can never fool--pawnbrokers, whores, and your mother. Since your mother's dead, I've taken her place. Hence, I'm bullshit-proof.\" in prophecies : \"Some day, Locke Lamora,\" he said, \"some day, you\u2019re going to fuck up so magnificently, so ambitiously, so overwhelmingly that the sky will light up and the moons will spin and the gods themselves will shit comets with glee. And I just hope that I\u2019m still around to see it.\" and in metaphysical inquiry : \"I can't wait to have words with the Gray King when this shit is all finished,\" Locke whispered. \"There's a few things I want to ask him. Philosophical questions. Like, 'How does it feel to be dangled out a window by a rope tied around your balls, motherfucker?\" Ahhhh... music to my ears. Overall, this was an insanely enjoyable read that merits 5 GOLDEN STARS . If you like adventure, heists, and a twisting and turning narrative, definitely pick this one up!

Locke's legendary wits are required to guide his merry band of thieves out of this mess safely. The world Scott lynch creates is fantastically detailed and very unique. The plot is fast paced, complex, and extremely entertaining. I loved the twists and turns, the surprises, and of course the cons pulled by Locke and co. The large cast of brilliant characters made even the sub plots a gripping read. This was at times a dark, gritty, and very brutal tale but that was mitigated by the fantastically humorous banter between the characters, and the very real friendship the Gentleman Bastards clearly shared with each other. Highly recommended to anyone who loves epic fantasy and is not to shocked by bad language!. Audio Note: Michael Page is the narrator here and as always he does a fantastic job. He is extremely good at differentiating between the many different characters voices. ...more The Lies of Locke Lamora is one of the most popular fantasy novels of (somewhat) recent years. This fact is actually very understandable, as it's a book with obvious appeal to the mass market, without being especially remarkable. Am I saying that it was a disappointment? No, not at all. It's an entertaining tale, and Scott Lynch has a fun style. But the language is simple, the scope of both storyline and setting is very small, and the book as a whole contains little complexity.

It's an entertaining tale, and Scott Lynch has a fun style. But the language is simple, the scope of both storyline and setting is very small, and the book as a whole contains little complexity. What it does have, in large amounts (at least in the second half), is suspense. As a story of thieves, gang wars and grand heists, the book performs more than adequately. Following Locke Lamora and his fellow Gentleman Bastards attempting to relieve the nobility of Camorr of their riches is a great way of spending a bunch of hours, as is witnessing the rising tension between elements of the city state's perilous underworld. I enjoyed reading the first book of the Gentleman Bastard series the same way I would enjoy reading a Robert Ludlum mystery; great entertainment, no literary masterpiece. It's a page-turner, but it won't burn itself solidly into my memory like more spectacular works of fantasy. So for those looking for a simple, yet deeply exciting fantasy novel, and who still haven't read this, I would not hesitate to recommend it. Personally, I am definitely excited about continuing reading the series, but when the time comes to read the sequels I will probably pick them as light reads between more complex books. ...more Let me get something out of the way first: this book is a masterpiece.

I would rather be dead myself than lose you.\u201d The world it\u2019s set in is big and honestly a little bit confusing at times. There are so many names and I could barely keep up with it all, especially having read this over such a long period of time. Anyway, the main action is set in an Italian/Spanish Renaissance (?) state/city (?) (I realize this review is awful, dw). Magic exists in this world, too, and we see some of it in this first installment (I believe it will play a bigger role in the rest of the series, though I\u2019m not sure). The world building was done gradually with tiny bits of info-dumps that, if you managed to focus while reading them, actually added a nice flavor to the novel and the world itself. (They reminded me a lot of the footnotes in Nevernight , and yes, I realize this book is older than NN but I read NN first.) One of my favorite ones was the story of \u201cThe whores of Camorr\u201d. Now, here comes my problem, and the reason why I \u201conly\u201d gave this 4 stars despite calling it a masterpiece: I\u2019ve had an extremely hard time focusing on this book. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s entirely its fault: I\u2019m an extreme mood-reader, and admittedly I wasn\u2019t in the mood to read this at all, and I could literally find a thousand things that I could do rather than reading. With that said, when I actually did sit down and read it, I enjoyed it a lot, especially the parts with witty dialogues. But I found myself skim-reading most of the descriptions (something I hate doing), and when I finally finished it I was glad. Be it partly my fault or not, I don\u2019t think a book that does that to you deserves your five stars. ...more Actual rating : 4.5 stars \"Someday, Locke Lamora,\u201d he said, \u201csomeday, you\u2019re going to fuck up so magnificently, so ambitiously, so overwhelmingly that the sky will light up and the moons will spin and the gods themselves will shit comets with glee.

What can be surprising and quite unsettling at first is the fact that Scott Lynch introduces his characters invertedly. Indeed if they seem to be just there at the beginning, thanks to the flashbacks and their interactions we slowly become acquainted and yes, attached to them of course I adore them all, duh . Moreover, I can only salute the splendid organization used here between what we learn in flashbacks in regards to the action set in present day. Fucking well-wrapped indeed. \u25cf\u2022\u06f0\u25ba Locke Lamora is a fucking genius in deception, a master in the game of make believe, an untrustworthy professional liar and highly deceptive bastard gentleman . Yet he is loyal to death, and trust me, he won't let you indifferent. \"... It's perfect! Locke would appreciate it.\" \"Bug,\" Calo said, \"Locke is our brother and our love for him knows no bounds. But the four most fatal words in the Therin language are 'Locke would appreciate it.'\" \"Rivalled only by 'Locke taught me a new trick,'\" added Galo. \"The only person who gets away with Locke Lamora games ...\" \"... is Locke Lamora ...\" \"... because we think the gods are saving him up for a really big death. Something with knives and hot irons ...\" \"... and fifty thousand cheering spectators.\" \u25cf\u2022\u06f0\u25ba Lamora's partners in crime all have something interesting to bring in the story, but frankly, what I ADORED were the awesome dialogues between them all. Jean, Calo, Galdo and little Bug, I love you all. \u25cf\u2022\u06f0\u25ba Chains can be referred as their mentor, and I must say that I particularly enjoyed his really insightful life lessons. \"When you don't know everything you could know, it's a fine time to shut your fucking noisemaker and be polite.\" Why, thank you, I shall try. O I'm interested in everything politically incorrect. DAMN how it spoke to my sarcastic self! We have : \u2714 A parody on religion, with quite cute prayers, I must say. \"Thanks for deep pockets poorly guarded,\" said the Sanza brothers (...) \"Thanks for watchmen asleep at their posts,\" said Chains. \"Thanks for the city to nurture us and the night too hide us,\" was the response.\" \u2714 Selfishness but friendship. Practical and prudent minds but extravagant craziness. Corruption everywhere. Schemes. Con inside con. Dear gentlemen bastards, I applaud you. \"There's no freedom quite like the freedom of being constantly underestimated\" O I would like some pieces of these priceless inside jokes, thank you. From page one I was laughing, feeling (almost) guilty, the hand on my mouth, at the ironical gritty writing. YES. I adore this kind of humor - the one that is hidden in every sentence, the whole thing said in the most casual way possible, as if sarcasm was just dropped in a \"business as usual\" fashion without any intention to make the reader laugh. AS IF. This shit is HILARIOUS. O While I'm at it, I'd rather be entertained, thank you very much. Several storylines happening in different times are followed, but it was never confusing to me (well, apart from the very beginning, I must admit), but on the contrary increased my interest. I mean, chronological order is so overrated! Apart from being disjointed , the story is a hell of an entertainment. Moreover, beware of your conceit, reader, because it reserves us several unexpected twists that shocked me something fierce. Mostly it can be read as Locke Lamora : a Life or Locke Lamora : story of a thief or Locke Lamora : how I became the guy who stole your shit or I worked with Locke Lamora and he taught me his tricks or ... Well, now, you get the idea right? O I want to learn more about this corrupt and crazy world we were talking about earlier. Concerning the world-building, I must say that Scott Lynch really knows his job : in what appears to be some alternative medieval settings, we get food/clothes/religions/cities/traditions/PEOPLE. The settings are highly detailed - sometimes it was a bit too much for me actually (see disclaimer). O Why, thank you, I shall take more of these gentlemen bastards pretty soon, because for real?

This book has some incredible world building, fascinating and well developed characters, a really neat story, and lots of fun plot twists. They call come together to make smashingly great book. World building : In any fantasy book the author MUST do an excellent job explaining to the reader the parameters of the world. How it is similar to earth (Canals exist! There is an aristocracy! Thieves are frowned upon!) and how it is different (Magic exists! There was an ancient civilization that has since vanished but their seemingly magical creations persist! New Gods!) are essential boundaries that must be set for the story to make sense and flow. This world building can't be passage after passage of exposition laying these things out since that tends to be boring writing and not very natural. Good writers can build the the world as they are building characters and plots; Scott Lynch is one such writer. First off the world this story takes place in is really fascinating. The main city of the story (for the story rarely strays beyond its limits), Camorr, is similar to Venice. It is an independent city that handles a lot of trade, has a very rich ruling class, and it riddled with islands and canals. But beyond the physical description Lynch peppers the text with small chapters that highlight the character of the city. One that I particularly liked was The Tale of the Old Handball Players . It worked on a few levels. On one level it informed the reader about the culture of the city and how much they get involved in citywide celebrations such as handball (fictional game) games. On another level it showed how deeply the culture of revenge was within the city's culture. And these stories also echoed some theme or event occurring in the main storyline. It worked really well. Secondly the world itself was really fascinating. While the action was mostly confined to the city of Camorr there were many references and comments about the wider world that gave the story added depth. While never visiting these places the influence of them was felt throughout the book. In the city itself Lynch paints a vibrant society comprising of thieves and nobles, black alchemists and priests, guards and soldiers. Simply put a fully fleshed out and lived in world that served as a character just as actual characters. There were distinct places with personalities of their own. I think the most interesting aspect of the cityscape was the Five Towers. These were immense towers built by a long vanished race/civilization that are occupied by the very highest of the noble families. The material is completely unknown but has the strange quality of both retaining light (to be released after sunset) and being completely transparent (which is rather unsettling from the higher levels). They are supplied by a network of cable cars both from the ground and between the towers. Really neat stuff. Culturally the world is also very well developed. There is a comprehensive set of religions, social behavior between and among classes is mapped out, and, most importantly, the underworld is given a rich and interesting structure. Being a book about thieves this is obviously the most important part, but the context that world exists in is also important and Lynch develops it wonderfully. I think the most interesting aspect of underworld was the Secret Peace that the crime lord of the city struck with the powers that be: thieves wouldn't touch the nobles and the government wouldn't crack down on the crime lord. Thieves getting caught would still be hung and punished, but the brunt of the government would never come down on them. This was a pivotal part of the story that Lynch works with quite well. Fascinating and interesting characters : On top of the great world was really fun characters. The story mostly revolved around the eponymous Locke Lamora and his band of gentleman thieves. They were all great. From Bug, the young protege of the Gentlemen Bastards, to the twins Calo and Galdo, to Chains, the mentor to the Gentleman Bastards, and, naturally, Locke himself to name but a few. Lynch structured this story with three components: the main story, flashbacks, and the aforementioned cultural vignettes. The flashbacks mostly focused on the youth of the the Gentleman Bastards and did a a wonderful job building up their personalities and histories. They gave the reader a sense for their training and the defining moments of their lives. It was very effective both in developing the characters and forming an emotional bond between the reader and character. Much like the cultural vignettes these flashback chapters tended to apply to the events of the main story. Lynch showed deft in not just bringing the Gentlemen Bastards to life, but also the ancillary characters, even if we only saw them a few times. Everyone one the page had a life and agenda as real people in the world do. Everyone felt very real and acted in a reasonable manner given their unique motivations. By the end of the book I was deeply invested in the fate of all the characters, even the nobles the Gentlemen Bastards were scamming because Lynch does a great job humanizing everyone. What's that you say? Scamming the nobles? What about the Secret Peace I spoke of earlier? Well that leads into... A really neat story : Some books can skate by on the strength of its characters. Thankfully the story is excellent. Revolving around the Gentleman's Bastards and their confidence job on a noble family the story takes a lot of twists and turns. There is betrayal, murder, new players barging onto the scene, old scores being settled, and the Gentleman Bastards caught betwixt it all. Lynch kept the pace going, throwing in the flashback and cultural vignettes at the right times to augment the story and timed the twists to keep the tension ratcheted up. I don't want to give too much of the story away but it was very well crafted and worked extremely well for the characters. So, yeah, this was an awesome book. Had some nice mafia vibes going, a light touch of magic, and an extremely engaging cast of characters. It also ends with plenty of interesting paths for story to develop further.

Was it two weeks about to get through Lies of Locke Lamora ? I don't even know now but it took for-flipping-ever. You'd think if the book was so hard to soldier though, I would have quit out. Well Crystal and I were buddy reading this and I think we both stubbornly decided to finish even if it killed us! Lies of Locke Lamora was not a bad book. I just know now that I am not the intended audience. This was a quiet sort of fantasy. There were no dragons, no wide array of alternate races, no multi-faceted magic system (although there was some magic), and no major epic battles (don't get me started on that anti-climactic showdown of an ending). Who this book would appeal to : If you're the type of person who likes intrigue, politics, blackmail, low-key world building (descriptive yet somehow not large in scale) and such, you will probably enjoy this book. There was less of an emphasis on character building. Instead, the focus was shifted to the inner workings of this society. If you're the type of person who likes scams, cons, plotting, scheming, etc. you'll dig on this book. In fact, the cons were my favorite parts of the book. The tricks that this group of gentlemen bastards pulled off were impressive. Why it didn't work for me : It took me a couple of chapters to even figure out what genre I was reading. Never have I been so confused by reading a book. Was it fantasy? Was it alternate history? I think I settled on fantasy but it doesn't read like high fantasy. Again, I want to go back to that word quiet . Perhaps someone else might use the word crafty. That could potentially be an apt word but it wasn't crafty enough for me. The biggest hurdle for me was that I need to attach to the characters in my books, and I never felt an attachment to any one person, which means I didn't much care who lived or died. That's not good. Why I felt the book worthy of 3 stars and not a lower rating : I recognized that the style just didn't suit my personal preferences but this doesn't mean that I didn't appreciate some things about the book. There were several moments of humor, as well as a few fun scenes (referencing the cons I mentioned above). The magic system wasn't as fleshed out as I'd like but some of the creatures were interesting or scary. The huge spider scene was actually amusing. Final thoughts : The first few pages were interesting. The last few pages were interesting. A few scenes scattered throughout the book were interesting. The rest of the book dragged. It felt like the longest book I'd ever read, even though I'm pretty sure I've read quite a few books that were much longer. You know you're in trouble when you're having to consult with your buddy reading partner to get encouragement to continue! I said in an earlier comment that I might continue eventually but the more I think about it, the more I think that this is the end of the line. There are too many books out there and several other fantasy series I'd rather be reading. I love the genre but this book didn't work for what I want and expect out of a fantasy. Maybe I'm just not as analytically minded as the intended audience. Who knows? ...more", "Title": "The Lies of Locke Lamora"},
