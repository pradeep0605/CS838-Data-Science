I never thought I would love it the way I did, I mean, I knew I would like it, but not that I would be this crazy about it. My problem with other Sparks novels: His beginnings are always very slow , so until now I never gave more than 4 stars to any of his books. But that was not the case at all with this one.I loved every page of it. I never was dissatisfied at all, actually I couldn't stop thinking about the book. If you liked A Walk to Remember and The Notebook, you will love this one because for sure as it has the same style, while most Sparks' other books are of a different sort. The characters: Were should I start? Ronnie was a great character.To watch her grow and mature through the whole book was great, I loved to see how she went from a confused and rebel teenager to a full-grown young woman. She managed to end up satisfied with her life and proud for what she accomplished. Jonah, her younger brother, was the sweetest kid ever. I couldn't get enough of him. Every time he said 'awesooome' I just wanted to hug him forever,LOL. And Will... well, he is the boy you would love to take home and introduce to your parents, the kind of guy that once you get him you would never wanna set him free. I completely adored him. Every time he appeared and said something I melted. My heart was his from page one. And Steve, Oh, Steve. I loved him since page 1. I couldn't have asked for a better father figure for the kids. He was so patient and so what Ronnie needed. I was just so happy to see how he finally managed to get in good terms with his children again. But the best thing about this book was the process, to see how both of them started trusting and caring for their father once more. The book: I just loved how everything developed. Everything connected just right at the end. And what an ending. I love books with a HEA. Although this book will make you burst into tears like a cry-baby, SO BE READY and have some tissues at hand. seriously, I spent the last 100 pages crying and crying and CRYING. I'm not kidding with the tissues, you will really NEED them. This book was so heartbreaking at times that I felt my heart breaking into a million pieces. It touched me in ways I never thought a book could. I just loved this book and would strongly recommend it. =) ...more (<---B>Is it just me or Milers really look stoned here*kidding*</---B>) Amazing book, it's kind of emotional and depressing in the end but still it has a happy ending. Ronnie was like a character that I can personally relate to and the dialogues are just humorous. It's kinda like predictable but all in all it's really meaningful and highly recommended to all Sparks fans. When you look at modern Women's Fiction (or Chick Lit, as it is called for whatever reason), <---A>Nicholas Sparks</---A> is one of the few names you cannot turn away from that easily. He has written more novels than many other authors, most of them have become quite popular, and if you take a look at his Goodreads page, you might realize that thirteen of his novels have more than 100,000 ratings. There was only one author who I discovered to have more novels than Sparks with such an achievement on Goodreads When you look at modern Women's Fiction (or Chick Lit, as it is called for whatever reason), Nicholas Sparks is one of the few names you cannot turn away from that easily. He has written more novels than many other authors, most of them have become quite popular, and if you take a look at his Goodreads page, you might realize that thirteen of his novels have more than 100,000 ratings. There was only one author who I discovered to have more novels than Sparks with such an achievement on Goodreads. It's easy to figure out why people like this novel, and I understand and value all of the raving opinions. The concept is pretty interesting, too. A teenage-girl one step before entering adulthood trying to deal with life and the obstacles thrown at her, her dysfunctional family trying to hold together what hasn't already been shattered, and this gorgeous boy from neighborhood who is so sweet and courteous and attentive that it seems like Nicholas Sparks wants you as a reader to fall in love with him as well. And that's already the problem: I just don't buy it. People can be as beautiful as possible, but it's impossible to judge whether the soul behind that beauty is just as beautiful ... or maybe ugly. However, Sparks defined Will, the protagonist's love-interest, as sweet and beautiful and successful and ... did I mention beautiful? Throw in the facts that Will rescues endangered animal species, has a lot of friends and experience and is one of the best atheletes in his town. Let's summarize: He is the perfect guy. It seems like Nicholas Sparks wants to handle every stereotype available out there. He introduces the cruel, mean antagonist who finds pleasure in making life difficult for others, terrorizing them and treating women like shit. Guess the purpose of this? To make the perfect guy shine even brighter, of course. Nobody is as perfect as <---C>Will Blakelee</---C>, but Sparks seems to want his reader to believe just that. But allow me to question one thing: If Will had had the same character, but another appearance, not the Liam Hemsworth kind, but a not-so-attractive guy ... would the movie have been that successful then? I guess not. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against romance novels. I liked Ronnie, the female protagonist, and the story of her family, I adored her little brother Jonah, and the writing was not as bad as I initially feared. But I do have something against novels defining love by how good-looking people are. ...more Reviewed by Jaglvr for TeensReadToo.com Veronica \"Ronnie\" Miller won't be eighteen until the end of the summer, so she has to follow her mom's rules and is off with her younger brother, Jonah, to spend the summer with her dad in a North Carolina beach town.

Ronnie hasn't talked to her dad in over three years. He left New York City and their family and moved back to his hometown. Ronnie is rebellious and having been arrested for shoplifting back home, a quiet summer in North Carolina might be the best thing for her. At least that's what her mother thinks. Ronnie arrives with the intention of ignoring her dad. On her first night there she wanders the beach and meets a girl, Blaze, who seems okay. But Blaze is addicted to Marcus, and Marcus is bad news. And Marcus is interested in Ronnie. Ronnie can tell Marcus is trouble and tries to avoid him. But the triangle will ultimately create problems. On a brighter note, Jonah is totally content in North Carolina and with spending time with his father. He has no desire to return to New York City. Jonah has joined his father in creating a replacement stained glass window for a church that burned in town. As the summer unfolds, Ronnie falls in love with a local boy, Will. She discovers the wonders of Loggerhead turtles. And she learns to trust her father all over again. As the summer comes to a close, more than one tragedy occurs, and Ronnie must face some hard truths in her life. I have to admit that it's been a while since I truly loved one of Mr. Sparks' novels. Don't get me wrong, I do adore his work. But it's been ages since I sat down with one of his books and found myself with tears in my eyes. This was one of those rare stories. With about forty pages to go in the novel, I found myself with wet eyes and the sniffles. THE LAST SONG is already in movie post production starring Miley Cyrus as the rebellious Ronnie. With the main character being a teenager, and with subplots of rebellion and first love, THE LAST SONG is a novel that will appeal to a wide audience: teens and adults alike. With the addition of Miley in the title role when the movie is released, THE LAST SONG will find even wider circulation. As with all of Mr. Sparks' books, expect tears, joy, love, and ultimately redemption and forgiveness for many of the characters. The wonderful characters in THE LAST SONG will stay with you long after the final page is turned. ...more I have always enjoyed Sparks\u2019 books but we all know that we can only read his books at certain times (at least for me) because we CRY!

I have heard about this one because I don\u2019t live too terribly far from where it is filmed (my great pal Kathryn lives super close!!) and it was taunting me at Target last week. I bought it on Thursday, picked it up on Friday night to start reading it, went to bed reading it, picked it back up on Saturday and finished it! This is probably my favorite out of all of his books. I have read almost all of them and so far, this one takes the cake. Ronnie is such a relatable character to me on many levels and the whole first love/coming of age story is something that we have all experienced. I fell in love with the characters, cried when they cried (of course), got mad when they did stupid things, and was rooting for Ronnie the entire time. Throughout the novel, you see Ronnie\u2019s complete transformation and realization as to who she is as defined by herself and not by those she surrounds herself with. So often we tend to adapt to those around us and do our best to fit it at any cost (emotionally, physically, etc.) and for the past few years that is what Ronnie has done. It is not until she is forced to come see her dad that she finds out who she is and what is truly important in life. This is Sparks\u2019 longest novel and he couldn\u2019t have done any better with it in my opinion. I highly recommend it to teens and adults alike and will definitely be going to see the movie at the end of March. ...more Loved this book. It was different to the movie and went into more detail.

Not a huge fan of hers, so when I started this book, her image and voice resonated in my brain and it matched perfectly with Ronnie's (short for Veronica) character.

Seventeen year old Ronnie Miller\u2019s life was turned upside down when her parents divorced and her father moved away from New York to North Carolina. After three years of anger and alienation from her father, she is forced to spend the summer in Wilmington with her dad, a former concert pianist and teacher. During this summer of growth, revelation and maturity, Ronnie is faced with the possibility of mending her differences and coming to terms with her new reality. Overall, I feel this book isn\u2019t one of Sparks strongest examples of his writing abilities, but it\u2019s signature of his style to pull at your heart strings. I think what won me over was the main character\u2019s demonstration of personal growth, maturity and compassion, but it took me a while to get there. Good book with a slow start but strong ending. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t give up because I ended up really liking it. ...more \u201cSometimes you have to be apart from people you love, but that doesn't make you love them any less.

This book had something true to it, well, it must have been the characters who had a vibe of realness in them that most books lack sometimes. Ronnie is a seventeen-year-old girl who's definitely have some issues with her parents. It all began three years ago when her parents got divorced and she never talked to her father ever again. This summer though she and her little brother have to spend her summer with their father in the little town where he lives. Ronnie starts mending her relationship with her father slowly and steadily while in the meantime she makes enemies and friends and most importantly falls in love with one of those guys she never liked or felt attracted to, but Will is the exception. Will is the only person in the world that can actually put up with Ronnie and her peculiar self she is most widely know for. He chases her and not for one minute does he give up on her until she's his. And they fall in love, they spend their summer together, always together, doing things together like watching over the turtle nest outside Ronnie's house because a raccoon has been seen lurking around. They kiss and they talk and they learn about each other. It's so beautiful. And so real. Which is why I loved it so much. I've certainly watched my share of romantic movies based on Mr. Spark's novels but I've never quite liked them that much that I would grab the book and read it but maybe it's just that the movies lack what his books have, that magic and realness because the movies seem somehow shallow.. Well, okay, read this because it's heartbreaking and heartmending and it explores lots of things about the parent-kid relationship. That's about it.

Todo comienza en las vacaciones de verano, cuando una adolescente de 17 a\u00f1os rebelde y hostil se ve obligada a pasar el verano en un pueblo de Carolina del Norte con su pap\u00e1 y su hermano menor. Ronnie, que no se habla con su padre desde que se divorci\u00f3 de su madre, no puede esperar a ser mayor de edad y poder tomar sus propias decisiones. As\u00ed, decide ignorar a su padre, un profesor de piano que desde chica le inculc\u00f3 el amor por la m\u00fasica. Lo que comienza como un verano intolerablemente eterno, pronto se torna en un punto de inflexi\u00f3n para Ronnie, al conocer a Will, un atractivo jugador de v\u00f3leibol y voluntario en el acuario, y enamorarse por primera vez de un chico. As\u00ed, comenzamos a ver poco a poco la gran evoluci\u00f3n de Ronnie a lo largo de la novela, al tener que aceptar que, a veces, las cosas no son nada simples y que las personas suelen equivocarse. Sin embargo, me arriesgar\u00eda a decir que el primer amor no es la tem\u00e1tica central de la novela, sino un m\u00e9todo de distracci\u00f3n que utiliza el autor para hacer que el lector se encari\u00f1e con los personajes y se vaya metiendo dulcemente en la historia. Con todo, a medida que el verano se va acercando a su final, un triste giro de los acontecimientos toma a Ronnie desprevenida y la acercar\u00e1 a su padre, lo que la har\u00e1 redescubrir la importancia del amor entre un padre y sus hijos. Como consecuencia, y en alusi\u00f3n al t\u00edtulo de la novela, ambos compartir\u00e1n una vez m\u00e1s su amor por la m\u00fasica para componer juntos la \u00faltima canci\u00f3n. \"La \u00faltima canci\u00f3n\" es una novela preciosa que logra emocionar al lector hasta las risas y hasta las l\u00e1grimas. Una frase: \u2013Tienes que aprender a perdonar. Ronnie cruz\u00f3 los brazos. \u2013Ya he perdonado a Will. Le he dejado mensajes... Incluso antes de que pudiera hablar su padre empez\u00f3 a sacudir la cabeza. \u2013No estoy hablando de Will. Primero tienes que aprender a perdonarte a ti misma. ...more JIMINY CRAP!!!!!!!!!

I borrowed and put MAGYK aside to read this. And I will never regret it. I told you, half way till end, I was listening to Miley Cyrus sing 'When I look at you'. I don't even like her but the song was great. I remembered going inside my room when I reached chapter 30 because I knew something will happen and will bring me to tears. Then I read Chapter 31. I cried so so much. And when i finished crying, I'll hear the chorus of the song, and read more touching scenes and I will cry again. I repeated that process over and over and over again. It's just so sad that this book isn't mine..haha I didn't cry over a book ever that way. Well, I cried when I read New Moon when Edward left Bella but this was different. It's so touching and I felt my world falling apart as I read. Its simply beautiful. I love it. I love the characters especially Ronnie's brother. He's so funny and adorable. I wouldn't miss watching this film. Please. Read this. Not reading this would be like never having to taste chocolate. Or never having to see colors. This book is brilliant. ...more This is my fav nick sparks book ever! Which is saying something because his other book, A Walk to Remember is heartwrenchingly beautiful and made me bawl like a baby!

Which is saying something because his other book, A Walk to Remember is heartwrenchingly beautiful and made me bawl like a baby! One of the main reasons why I adore this book is the writing, I love how the characters interact with each other and everyone has their sassy pants on. I had fun reading this book :D I've been fangirling during the cute moments between Ronnie and Will. They banter and kid around with each other a lot, but you could also sense the connection and chemistry between the two of them. Their relationship feels real, it relies on mutual respect and trust which I really like because it doesn't promote any elements of the infamous insta-love theme *shudders*. They were frenemies at first but of course the love between them develops into something much deeper... This book has multiple POVs, each person has their own voice/writing style, my favorites are of course, Ronnie and Will's. I've read a couple of books where everyone sounds the same, thankfully this wasn't the case. What makes this book different is that we also get POV from the antagonists, which brings a different angle, and also better understanding of events that happened in the book. Although I kinda feel guilty for skipping some of the parts from Ronnie's dad cause it's boring (sorry). Beware though, this book made me cry like a whole lot due to unexpected feels. So make sure there are tissues near you, just in case. P.S Nick Sparks wrote this book especially for Miley. She's awesome :) Update 2/2/17 I wrote this review back in 2013 but I just wanna add this here because I'm a big fan of Miley (seriously her song, Adore You remains my favorite of hers) and I was struck with a wave of nostalgia when I saw it on Instagram because it's just like that moment in the car when they sang together, but only now it's Miley and Liam <3 ...more \"La vida era como una canci\u00f3n.

In the beginning there is mystery, in the end there is confirmation, but it's in the middle where all the emotion resides to make the whole thing... worthwhile.\u201d The Last Song is my first Nicholas Sparks' book and I am positively certain this book will not be my last. The Last Song is a heartfelt story about first love, loss, the common problems of a teenager's life and is filled with many emotions and stunning, but imperfect characters that develop throughout the novel. It's a quick summer read that portrays many realistic feelings of the characters, good writing (that isn't overly descriptive), fun/sad experiences of life, and has a great solid storyline from beginning to end. The Last Song is told from multiple points of views and to me, it was the annoying part of the book because I don't really like switching from multiple points of views. I'm the type of person who prefer to read only in one multiple point of view. That's just me! I find it a bit confusing, but it was something that I had to adjust to as I read more and from then on, the reading experience was more enjoyable. The Last Song is written to tell about a 17-year old girl, Veronica (Ronnie) Miller, who is forced to go to New York City during the summer to visit her father along with her brother. Ronnie is a stubborn, rebellious teenager who is angry partially due to the fact that her parents had divorced three years ago and her beloved father moved from New York City to Wilmington, North Carolina. Her mother thought that it would be best for Ronnie to go visit her father to try to tie their fragile bond together and be more close. While living in North Carolina, she experiences first love, loss, and many drama and everything she thought she knew comes crashing down on her... At first, Ronnie is a rebellious and kind of an irritating person, but also deep down, Ronnie is a really kind person with flaws and is a very caring person who will fight for anything she believes in. Basically, she is your average teenager who has spunk and humor that I really enjoyed. We get to glimpse Ronnie's damaged and very flawed side and we can understand where she is coming for. Nicholas Sparks does a great job of portraying these emotional feelings and excellent character depth! The romance was developed very well and even though it was corny, it was absolutely adorable and beautiful to witness this newly love affair. Many sweet moments of deep stolen kisses and meaningful conversation played a likeable aspect of the book. My favorite part in The last Song was the relationship between Ronnie and her father and how it strengthened and developed over time by communication, memories, special times, and music. It was absolutely perfect, real, and has a unique charm to it! We also get to see how Ronnie changes during the course of the book and how she still remains strong during the sad/devastating moments of her life. It was something..amazing to see...The storyline was also really entertaining and flowed well with ease and moderate pace. The Last Song is a beautiful coming-of-age book about first love, family, loss, and plenty of drama. I would recommend this book to those who enjoyed heartfelt, endearing contemporary novels or those who are fans of Nicholas Sparks! \u201cEmotions come and go and can't be controlled so there's no reason to worry about them. That in the end, people should be judged by their actions since in the end it was actions that defined everyone.\u201d ...more An angst-ridden teenager. Placed in a foreign location.

As with every other book written (by Sparks and others), this book follows the typical teen plotline. There is nothing fascinating, compeling or unique. There is nothing endearing about the aggressive Ronnie and nothing deep or revealing about her relationship with Will, there only connection seems to be angst. Her parents got divorced. His kid brother died.

Having a first view of the book I could tell that probably I don't belong to the \"target group\" that this novel is more suitable for...the plot and well Nicholas Sparks previous one First of all you should excuse me in advance since this is only the first ever review that I write not only for a book but for well whatever...and well also apart from that it's the first book I've read since at least ten years ago...and that's not all hehe,until now I was used to reading a different style of books... Having a first view of the book I could tell that probably I don't belong to the \"target group\" that this novel is more suitable for...the plot and well Nicholas Sparks previous ones indicated that it's mostly women and especially young ages one that will most likely to be fond of reading it... It looked to have all those things inside that men are making fun of women reading...romance...nice landscaping...a young girl falling in love...and well too many thrilling moments expected that could cause many tears like always (judging by his movies at least...never had the chance to have a book of him in the past) So starting reading it well it confirmed that his style is most like expected but somehow it was really really interesting...having each chapter based in each character's prespective gave me a total view of how everybody was thinking making it hard to turn off the e-book only when I really had no choice because I should deal with some other things of major importance :) It surely contains drama,but much more than just that...there is no doubt that he knows how to write...has the ability of describing everything with such a detail that actually transfers you at the scene of the place,he has really nice dialogues authentic ones...it is certain that Sparks in fact studied the characters really well...Jonah,Ronnie,Will,Steve are talking with everyone having his/her own style really based to the age to the livings of every person...very smart lines,specially the ones were the young couple uses to tease each other probably the most amusing ones and perhaps a source of inspiration of every young one wants to flirt with someone in a nice way without provoking at all...just words to cause the other one to smile,not provoking ones...teaching the readers how to approach the person of the opposite sex in a sweet and innocent way :) On the other hand of course this book has a bit of censorship...no swearing and cursing...by none of the characters though there are also some \"bad boys\" in the story that it's impossible not to have \"non allowed\" words in their vocabulary...no alcohol or drug scenes...it's like some american teen series which avoid to show certain things in order not to shock their audience...but ok in a way it's respectful About the story well it's really nice to promote the idea of real love not only between a guy and a girl but the most fundemental one which is between a parent and a child and vice versa...how this love can grow...what it really means sacrificing things that you like in order to please the one you love... Sparks has the majestic charisma of dealing with things that really bothered each one of us...not knowing how to solve a problem when occuring...calculating any possible consequence of our actions...it's like he knows that every reader had to actually deal with a similar issue earlier in his/her life... In my opinion the book reaches its peak when finally the turtle \"phenomenon\" takes place...after that it seems that everything is happening too fast...days pass by one after another...weeks..months...and though it still remains really fascinating to read it creates like a wish that it should more slowly so we should have had the chance to read even more...it ended really quickly so that's the main reason that I put 4 instead of 5 starts...I wanted more...hehe :) Now I know how the ideal father looks like..the ideal daughter...the ideal brother or sister...boyfriend...girlfriend...friends...perhaps the only type of person that you cannot learn from how to be in this novel is mother...but ok it's mostly cause there aren't involved so much in the story...so in case you belong to any of those types...and I am sure everyone of us has at least a friend or and definitely has as well a girlfriend and a boyfriend...so we can all learn what to do...to picture ourselves being one of Last Song's characters..and hopefully not Marcus... Hmmm the conclusion of the whole book...I should carry on reading books and I wonder what made me stop...novels like this motivate me for sure to start finding another one as well...and well with a bit of luck to make a better review next time... :p Last by not least I would like to thank the person who made me deal with books as well and invited me also to join \"Goodreads\" and opened my eyes in many ways to reconsider things and how life should be...do everything based on your love to others..to your beloved and the winner will be you :) ...more I finished The Last Song and have sufficiently recovered from the thumping toothache it gave me from being so saccharine and sweet.

An I finished The Last Song and have sufficiently recovered from the thumping toothache it gave me from being so saccharine and sweet. Even after finishing it and mulling it over a bit, I\u2019m still not entirely sure I liked it. I think I\u2019m leaning very much towards no. Veronica \u201cRonnie\u201d Miller is 17 and going through 'that' stage. She\u2019s disrespectful to her mother, she goes out partying and clubbing in New York where she lives and she\u2019s also had a slight run in with the law due to some shoplifting. And she\u2019s less than thrilled when her mother packs her and her brother Jonah off to spend the summer in Nowhere, North Carolina with their dad. Their dad left three years ago and Ronnie hasn\u2019t spoken to him since. And she\u2019s definitely not interested in spending 3 months with him. Ronnie is all types of attitude from the get-go. She meets a girl named Blaze at the local sort of carnival/fair on her first night and takes off with her and three older, trouble-written-all-over-them boys up the beach. She takes off the next morning refusing to tell her father where she was going and stays out until 2am. To be honest, if I\u2019d have read this book when I was 17 and fighting for my own adult independence and freedom, I might have empathized with Ronnie a little. But quite frankly, she just struck me as a brat who needed a bit of a kick up the wazoo. Essentially, The Last Song is a coming of age story about Ronnie growing some self-awareness and some self-respect but it\u2019s done so fakely that I could just not get into it. Apart from the whole ridiculous storyline with Blaze and her semi-boyfriend Marcus, there\u2019s Will Blakelee thrown into the mix. Will is rich. Will is handsome. Will becomes enamored with Ronnie and the purple streaks in her hair and her black nailpolish from the first moment he collides with her on Ronnie\u2019s first night in town. They have several misunderstandings but it turns out that they like each other. They both think the other is different. They date. They fall in love! Oh no, Will\u2019s rich and snobby mother doesn\u2019t approve! Oh no, Marcus is lurking around causing trouble! So many things happen in this book that just seem entirely unnecessary. The whole shoplifting thing with Blaze. The whole Marcus wrecking Will\u2019s sisters wedding thing. And then of course, there is the Reveal That Changes Ronnie Completely. It\u2019s such a trite, clich\u00e9d ending whereby girl learns the error of her selfish teenage ways and ascends the throne into adulthood over the course of about the last third of the summer. I usually like happy endings, and even though this one is kind of two parts sad with one part perfection, I was still extremely dissatisfied. This story was just so full of nauseating moments that I just couldn\u2019t really enjoy it. Even when Nicholas Sparks tries to make rebellious, evil characters, it doesn\u2019t quite ring true. They don\u2019t seem all that fleshed out \u2013 more like what he thinks antagonists should be. Even Ronnie at her wildest was pretty tame for a teenager. She went to all sorts of clubs in New York City and never even had a drink. There was also far too much religion in the latter part of this book for me to stomach. Sparks seems quite religious, God and religion was a bit of a theme in Dear John too, but it was much more prevalent in this book. All the praying and the God\u2019s way and God\u2019s will at the end got a bit much for me personally. Some people might really identify with that but I find heavy handed religion pretty off putting in novels. I hear a lot of criticism about Sparks about his novels being pretty cookie-cutter. After Dear John I thought that if they were all like that, it\u2019d be quite possible those critics were right. But The Last Song stepped it up to a whole new level! This book is no different from a thousand teenage romance stories out there. I think that might do me for Nicholas Sparks \u2013 for the foreseeable future anyway. ...more As most of you know, I LOVE Nicholas Sparks. I did find this book very predictable more so than most of his other books. I can see where it would appeal to the \"younger\" crowd. The main character is 17 yrs old and with Miley Cyrus having a say in the character's name and a dedication in front of the book, it is sure to be a seller among young teen readers! However, I am not sure how I feel about this book. The story is sad, frustrating and unrealistic at times. I don't like the way the mother ha As most of you know, I LOVE Nicholas Sparks.

However, I am not sure how I feel about this book. The story is sad, frustrating and unrealistic at times. I don't like the way the mother handled the \"divorce\" situation, I think that the 17 year old was a disrespectful to her family and with no real consequences. It seems that the younger brother is made out to be a bit whiny (but he is only 10 yrs old). I like how the relationship between the father/daughter ended up but I feel sad that so many years were lost because of a misunderstanding that the mother was aware of. Without giving too much away, I would have to say yes, I liked it but not my favorite. The movie should be out soon so we will see how it all plays out. I gave it 2 stars, possibly 3. It was a little escape from life's crazy, busy days! Enjoy it, just don't expect too much. ...more Un libro hermoso, conmovedor y lleno de esperanza.

Isn't it funny the things that we remember whilst revisiting a book. This was a really nice story, Mr Sparks will always deliver a sweet story with angst and emotion, and always a message thrown in for reflection as well. More than 5 stars ,I enjoyed reading it from the first word to the last word of it , It was a light reading, and PERFECT The Last Song is by far so much better than the movie. Hands down. There are so many details that were not done in the movie that Sparks truly made the book feel complete and perfect. Since Nicholas Sparks wrote it, it is already a given that it will be sad. He always adds a dramatic twist at the end of his books, which is why I enjoy reading them! I will not spoil what happens but he gives indications early on as to what will occur so it becomes predictable.

I will not spoil what happens but he gives indications early on as to what will occur so it becomes predictable. However, the ending of this book is so bittersweet and adorable that made me love it even more. What bothers me is that this book is not only about a romance as what the movie depicts it to be. This book is about rebuilding a relationship between father and daughter. Their relationship as the book continues becomes genuine and beautiful. It makes you truly value one's own relationship with their parents. It took a few chapters to really get into it but by the middle I could not put it down til the end. A must read for everyone. I definitely recommend it to all. And bevare you are going to cry-A LOT! Of course, If I could change one thing about this book, I wouldn't want it to be so predictable, especially when it got towards the end. But The Last Song is a page turner! I enjoyed reading it and I believe anyone who reads it will enjoy it as well! Sparks does a fabulous job writing this novel it is a love story that also ties in how people can have family problems as well as trouble with friends. Not to mention it is an easy read and everyone can connect to at least one aspect this book has to offer. ...more 3 1/2...mmm yeah, I'm going with that.

Not surprisingly, Ronnie thinks she knows everything, and is determined her life is being ruined. She thinks her father just abandoned them, and has been angry ever since he left. She falls in with a bad crowd, and gets into serious problem with the law over the summer. In the meantime, she\u2019s learning maybe her father isn\u2019t so bad after all. I didn\u2019t like Ronnie at first. I suppose the reader was not meant to. However over the course of the book she began to grow, and by the end I really liked her. I wasn\u2019t expecting this to turn into an inspirational read\u2026.which is what kind of turned me off. Halfway through, there was a lot of discussion about faith in God, etc. Granted, someone is dying of a terminal disease, and who knows how one may feel facing this, but that doesn\u2019t do it for me in my books. I\u2019m just letting readers know what to expect. Whatever, Mr. Sparks. ...more \"Pero cuando es la persona correcta, lo es y simplemente lo sabes.\" Este libro es incre\u00edble.
