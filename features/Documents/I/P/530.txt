I am in love with this boy, I wanna go in the book and drop kick Chloe, so she can see what she is missing. I will say they have a lot of scenes alone together and they make me very happy. For all y\u2019all who don\u2019t know Chloe is a new discovered necromancer ( able to awaken the dead), first she thought she was schizo but it was discovered that the home she was sent to after experiencing seeing a ghost, were finding ways to harvest her powers. Well after breaking loose, Chloe and her entourage are now on the run. We have Tori the sarcastic rich girl,<---M> Simon the ever so sweet gentleman</---M>, Derek the leader and authority figure of the group, and of course sweet and na\u00efve Chloe. Its interesting to see these very young people go out and fend for themselves. They no longer can call parents for help because they might be placed in danger, some are the bad guys and others have already gone missing. Everyday is a journey of survival and new realities. Plus this foursome bring the laughs and good times. <---A>Kelley Armstrong</---A> is able to grab the reader and never let go, the relationships are real and very sweet. I am blown away by how a guy described as being ugly, can come off as the sexiest being, I am truly lusting after Derek. What this book lacks is romance but it is there if you manage to read between the lines. Overall an action packed book, with creepy dead things and just a pure thrilling ride. Peeved- They talk about a necklace and I have yet to see the significance, all I know is the color has changed. ...more I don't know how I feel about this one. I mean the kids are out there trying to get way from the evil people that are trying to hurt them. And we find out some reasons as to why they are the kind of supernaturals that they are but I was just sort of meh. I will say that I loved to get more time with Chloe and Derek. I really love Derek's character! And we learn more about the families of the kids.

Sometimes I wonder if it's the mood I'm in or if I really did just like the book and not love it to death. One will never know unless of course you read it again. Chloe, Rae and Tori are in cells at The Edison Group after they tried to escape with Derek and Simon in the first book. A bunch of stuff happens and Tori and Chloe get away and meet up with the boys. Then more stuff happens and it's a little cray. I also really love the ghost, Liz, in the book too. I hope we get to find out something good for her in the next book. I did enjoy the book, I'm just mad that I didn't love it to death, but we can love them all that way right? MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List ...more As seen on The Readventurer The second book in \"Darkest Powers\" trilogy starts where the first one left off - Chloe is at the research institute and contemplating escape.

What follows is pretty much Chloe's and her friends' journey to get to the person who might be able to help them find Derek's and Simon's father (which is I suppose is what this trilogy is about, but I am not sure at this point). The first book in the trilogy was undoubtedly drawn out and artificially extended, but this second book sure beats that. While \"The Summoning\" had at least some semblance of a story (specifically, the discovery of the true nature of Lyle House), \"<+++>The Awakening</+++>\" is truly 400 pages of filler. Almost nothing is added to the main story arc - only 3 pages describing the purpose of the experiments on supernaturals and the idea that Derek's and Simon's father can be found with the help of his friend - Andrew. The rest of the book is pretty much limited to: hiding in various warehouses (150 pages), hiding in an abandoned house (50 pages), riding a bus to Andrew's house (150 pages), and finally meeting Andrew (10 pages). \"<+++>The Awakening</+++>\" truly has no climax of any sort. It reads as a boring series of events that serve no purpose but to develop the characters, which is fine, when not used so shamelessly to fill pages and pages at the expense of the real plot. There are some nice Derek/Chloe moments, and only these moments save the book from being a complete waste of time. If I had hopes that the trilogy would pick up after a rather slow first book, I don't have them any more. The second book proved to be as boring of a read as the first one, and even worse. This is a pity, because Armstrong knows how to write an engaging and tightly plotted book. This Darkest Powers \"trilogy\" however is a shameless attempt to extend 250 pages of story into 3 books 400 pages each. I am not sure if I will ever get back to this series. I expect I will not be able to remember much about it even a month later. ...more The Awakening is even more enticing and action packed than its prequel. While the setting shifts, it is no less menacing as Chloe and the gang face a grim and tretcherous life on the streets. Tension is heightened by the added appeal of a perfectly sinister and powerful enemy and the suspense of unknown supernatural powers. Armstrong's teen characters are smart and resourceful, and each obstacle thrown their way requires them to use every bit of caution, wits, and intelligence they possess.

Their difficulties and the tension that they face help them grow as characters and make them more appealing. My crush on Derek has increased ten fold. The Awakening is a dark, gripping, and highly suspenseful read will have readers staying up to all hours of the night and leave them desperate for the next installment! ...more Alas, this is where <---C>Chloe Saunders</---C> and I must part ways.

Reeeaaalllllyyyy??? Okay, so I understand the whole concept of a demi-gods - when a god procreates with a human and vio-la! You get a demi-god. Okay, that I can handle and actually it's rather fascinating and worthy of my time and attention. But get this, according to Armstrong, you get a demi-demon by mutating the genetic make-up of a demon and as a result you get a human with less subtle demon powers and the added benefit of an attitude problem and anger management issues. Wait! I guess there is no benefit.<---F> Either way it's laughable at best</---F>. Okay so these mutations are conducted by The Edison Company. Where do they get the name you ask? Again\u2026 get this\u2026 this group of twisted scientists are named after Thomas Edison who not only invented some sound devices such as the phonograph, motion picture camera and the crafty little light bulb, but what I bet you didn't know is that he attempted to invent a device intended to contact the dead. Okay, I ask\u2026 did I read that right?^^ I'm sure I did, but just humor me for a bit. I think our history books are in need of a revision. So, this worthy set of scientists run their experiments and when the study goes array, they dispose of the subjects. Not so much of a problem if they were lab rats or guinea pigs (Well for animal humane societies, it might be an issue and nothing against rats or guineas) but unfortunately their subjects are TEENAGERS! So yes, they dispose of teenagers when their experiments fail. That's eff'ed up to say the least. Now on to the characters. There is not a one that I liked. Well maybe the ghost Liz was cool, but all the other characters were worthy of a head shake IMHO. Chloe is not a very bright girl and many of her attempts to either escape, manipulate/lie to the adults, fight off batty ghouls, dead people or wolves are just simply too drawn out or end up in failure. And she really needs to learn how to hold onto a knife! It's actually rather irritating. A smarter maybe more conniving Chloe would have been fun to read about. Rae?? Ugh! Tory?? Double up\u2026 Ugh.Ugh. (Yes, I still have that song in my head.) Simon and Derek\u2026 ohhhh Simon and Derek\u2026. What's to like about these two characters? One suffers from a puberty smack down and a bad case of body odor. Now, I understand Derek can't help his acne and BO, but if Armstrong was going to emphasize his insignificant flaws (notice my emphasis on insignificant), give him some character elements worthy of applause. But no, you have Simon that is simply his brother's shadow and Derek who's either brooding all the time or losing his temper. Oh that's right, his genetic makeup was altered so he can't help being in a constant state of anger. For most of the book, they spend hiding out in warehouses, catching buses, eating junk food and fighting off bats, ghouls, and wolves. Sounds like a fun adventure, right? But nope, I lost interest early on and never really found myself drawn back into the story. I guess this is just the rare occasion where the paranorm element wasn't enough to take me on a fictional adventure. Sorry, but that's just where it stood. :( Review Edit: I cleared Simon up of his acne that never existed. :) ...more I remember finishing the The Summoning, the prequel to The Awakening, last summer and thinking, \" I doubt Kelley will be able to top this.\" Though, apparently she can, as she has proven it with The Awakening.

Also, there was more information told and found out about the Edison Group and werewolves which was fascinating in any case. Derek and Chloe? Yep, their relationship defiantly grew throughout The Awakening and made it one of my favorite parts. I swear I will scream if they don't get together by the end of this series. Since, they are so cute with their bickering and how they always protect each other. Overall, The Awakening will have any fan of the Darkest Powers Trilogy begging for a sequel by the end. I look forward to reading the next book, tremendously. I wish Spring 2010 would come faster. Grade: A+ ...more Chloe Saunders is back in the second book of the Darkest Powers series.

With the help of Liz's ghost and a trapped demi-demon Chloe manages to find more information about the Edison group and how she can possibly escape from them. Once away from the Edison group Chloe is forced to face the reality of living on the run with nowhere and nobody to turn to other than Tori, Derek, and Simon. Her father has posted a $500,000 reward for her safe return and the Edison group is no longer worried about keeping any of them alive. Will Chloe and the others be able to outrun the Edison group or will their luck finally run out? Will Chloe ever figure out what her true feelings are for Derek and Simon? The Darkest Powers series is full of paranormal happenings, betrayal, and budding romance. I highly recommend this series for any fans of the Twilight series. Definitely not the same story line but just as good. ...more This is just one of those series where I want to read all three novels before I really give a solid opinion, but so far I like where it seems to be headed. The pacing could be better (meaning I wouldn't complain if things moved along somewhat) and the relationships could be clearer but overall it's a pleasant experience and I'm eager to read the final book.

The Awakening is a perfect edge-of-your seat read with plenty of surprises. Not only is this a great YA read, but it also is fitting for adults as well. Kelley has created a gritty, realistic world, one that Horror, Sci-fi, and Paranormal readers will love. Book II in the Darkest Powers trilogy takes us even farther into a world where the supernatural intrudes on the everyday life with riveting effect, and has a clear DO NOT ENTER sign that you will try to ignore.

The book starts in the middle of the attempted flight and ends with the - temporary - end of it. But, wow what a roller coaster! Although there is danger after danger, ghost after zombie after spell duel, the story remains believable and the characters real: Bickering, bratty witch Tori, puberty-hit werewolf Derek (with acne, anger-issues, wolfish stink, excruciatingly painful and puke-enhanced half-transformations), brave, unsure and compassionate necromancer Chloe and Simon, a diabetic womanizing sorcerer. I especially like the non-perfectness of everybody. For example, although the kids decide to call a truce and stop bitching against each other, Tori fails to keep her tongue in check. Although Chloe starts to like Derek more and more for himself as the story progresses and to appreciate her ability to talk freely of her anxieties to him, she still notices his flaws in appearance and is flattered by beautiful Simon's attentive flirtation. Kelley Armstrong really did a wonderful thing, when she decided to go for young adult fiction. I can't wait to read \"The Reckoning\" next year. ...more Reviewed by: Rabid Reads .

Mutts? Anyway, another quick and satisfying listen from Armstrong. Cassandra Morris\u2019 narration was appropriate for these audiobooks, her voice fit that of the fifteen year old MC\u2019s, and she incorporated Chloe\u2019s speech impediment into the dialogue admirably. However, as the story progressed and the heroine evolved, the child-like tone would have benefited from a slight adjustment. I had zero issues with listening to these installments one after the other because the performance was homogeneous, and the character voices didn\u2019t deviate. The pacing did Armstrong\u2019s writing style proud, and the built-in creep factor that comes with seeing ghosts was always present. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to purchase another Young Adult title that featured Morris as the narrator. ...more I haven't reviewed this yet? It's definitely time, now that the series is over!

I always love good character development, and this really delivered. Aside from Derek's experience, we finally get to see Tori change from her nasty mean girl act, Simon become even more endearing, and Chloe learn more about her powers and herself.

But Ms. Armstrong seems to forget her story and all of the suspense and build-ups need to reach an actual climax before the book comes to an end in order to satisfy her readers. When reading this second book of The Darkest Power trilogy, I felt like I was watching a poorly plotted, badly made horror movie---it's so badly made that I never feel frightened by any of the supposedly scary and/or intensive scenes done by Ms. Armstrong. Okay, the kids are now on the run from the bad guys and they got into one difficult situation after another, but it never feels real to me and I never feel they were in any real trouble; not even when they were hunted by a group of armed villains in a dark wood. What a letdown, Ms. Armstrong. I'm not impressed. To be honest, by the last 100 pages I was simply turning pages just to get the whole thing over with. I honestly think The Awakening would better off be a movie instead of a novel. At least the chasing scenes and the fight scenes would have been better and more intensive than being a bunch of uninspiring written texts. Our main girl Chloe is also a major letdown here, by now she realizes she can raise the deads at will, but what had she ever done with her power? Nothing. We are being led to think that Chloe is about to raise hell in this book, but it's a lie. Instead Chloe barely did anything other than running away and constantly being rescued by the two main boys. Hell, she didn't use her power as a mean of self defend when she and her friends were in danger. What a huge disappointment. Had Chloe ever been struggling to keep her power under control? Did she keep seeing ghosts and be scared out of her mind? Did the creepiness and darkness from the realm of death affect her sanity and taint her goodness? Had she ever been forced to use her power to hurt people and then regret it later? Nothing. You see, Chloe had gone through no soul-reaching when she was supposed to be 'struggling' to come to term with her power. Instead she reacted to the entire situation as emotional as a piece of wood. And the ending. My goodness, it must be one of the most underwhelming ending I had ever seen in a while.

Just sayin'. ...more I absolutely adored this book. More fast-paced than the first and with just a touch more romance: Chloe's characterisation is superb, the sweet blond necromancer is immediately endearing, and I am a shameless fan of the Derek and Chloe romance.

In book one of the DARKEST POWERS series, THE SUMMONING, Chloe and several of her friends escaped from the group home they had been living in. Now, Chloe and Rae are recaptured by the Edison Group, a shady organization that has genetically altered them to try and make use of the powers that many of them were born with. I found THE AWAKENING to be well-written, descriptive, and thoroughly engaging. This book had soul-searching, action, and even a little teen angst - although it only had a little to do with being a teen and a lot to do with being a supernatural with very little control over their lives or their powers. I would definitely recommend this book to others. Kelley Armstrong already has two popular adult series under her belt, and this is well on its way to being her third, and hopefully only the first for teens! I hope to see much more from her in the future. Reviewed by: Breia \"The Brain\" Brickey ...more Chloe Saunders is a fifteen year old necromancer on the run.

The werewolf has anger issues--and it's not portrayed as being a sign of what a sexy Alpha Male he is, but rather, a serious problem he needs to work on. Chloe's power is indistinguishable from mental illness to most people, and instead of it making her seem interesting and tragic, the book points out the stigma and mockery often attached to appearing non-neurotypical. And the relationships between the characters feel real, built by believable conversations about their interests and experiences. I look forward to the next book! ...more This series has been out forever, but I'm devouring it despite the somewhat simple plot. It reminds me of the good old days when I first fell in love with YA/PNR. I'm smitten with Simon, and can't wait to see what happens in the final book. I will definitely be reading more of Kelley Armstrong. This was a great 2nd book, no lads and thoroughly enjoyable. Derek is such a grump still. I'm a total fan. Chloe has also grown as a character. Totally cool urban fantasy. Este ha sido mejor que el primero, un ritmo mas ligero y lleno de acci\u00f3n que me ha hecho devorar el libro y ahora voy corriendo a por el \u00faltimo. Really slow, I just wanted it to be over. I didn't really like any of the main characters. Hoping the next book will be better. I've done my best to keep spoilers for the previous book to a minimum, but if you haven't read The Summoning , you should start there. The Awakening picks up pretty much where the last book left off, with Chloe and Rae prisoners of the people who were running Lyle House, only now they're in what looks like a bunker. Simon and Derek are still on the loose but Tori has also been moved. Chloe learns that her aunt Lauren, Dr Gill, Dr Davidoff and others are part of a group called the Edison Group, mos I've done my best to keep spoilers for the previous book to a minimum, but if you haven't read The Summoning , you should start there. The Awakening picks up pretty much where the last book left off, with Chloe and Rae prisoners of the people who were running Lyle House, only now they're in what looks like a bunker. Simon and Derek are still on the loose but Tori has also been moved. Chloe learns that her aunt Lauren, Dr Gill, Dr Davidoff and others are part of a group called the Edison Group, most of them supernaturals themselves who experimented on their own offspring and that of others, genetically mutating them in an effort to help them \"fit into\" society better. They kept them ignorant and those that couldn't be \"rehabilitated\" were killed - like Liz. Escaping from the Edison Group, Chloe and Tori are reunited with Derek and Simon. Simon has had no luck finding his dad, Kit, with the spell, and so they decide to try Kit's old friend and emergency contact, Andrew, who lives outside New York. Getting there is far from simple though, with the Edison Group on the hunt for them and Chloe's dad putting her picture and a reward in the paper. Not only that, but Chloe inadvertently raises the dead and Derek's werewolf side poses problems. I was really slow, while reading the first book just before picking up this one, in realising that this series is set in the same contemporary world as Armstrong's Women of the Otherworld series. This is essentially the YA version, with new and younger characters and a new angle. The first book established some highly engaging characters in Chloe, Derek, Simon, Tori and the others, who continue to develop in the sequel. There are more chilling moments when Chloe accidentally raises zombies and sees a girl having her throat slit over and over again, but as someone who's no fan of horror, the scenes were terrifying without being off-putting or too gruesome. The story is never boring, which is worth mentioning because as with a lot of YA novels, we get a lot of details about relatively mundane things. A lot is cramped into a short space of time - the first book covered a week, though it felt longer, and this one covers about the same, only because they never get any real sleep time stretches out and is hard to keep track of. But for realism, you need those details. With Chloe's engaging narration, every detail is fascinating because her world, her situation is fascinating. It's a survival story, and the details matter. Chloe's an interesting choice for narrator - a quiet girl, tiny in stature and only just fifteen. Tori makes some acidic comments about her that help us get perspective, even if they make us more sympathetic towards Chloe. She has fire when she needs it, stands up for herself despite the occasional stammer when she gets nervous, but hasn't suddenly developed amazing fighting skills or worldly wisdom. She's a sheltered girl suddenly living on the streets, and it's true that the boys are over-protective of her. But you can't help liking Chloe, sympathising with her, empathising and understanding her. Derek's another engaging character, complex and independent of the author. He's one of those characters whom you just know wrote himself - no one else would be able to do a good enough job! It's apparent that something pretty special is slowly building between him and Chloe, but Armstrong isn't rushing it, and it's a long process to understand Derek and his abrupt, pushy, arrogant attitude. And it's nice to see them gradually grow closer and trust each other. Armstrong's prose is as strong and smooth as ever, even clipped to YA style as it is. There are still some unexplained things, such as the pendant necklace that Chloe's mother gave her and why it's changed colour, and I confess I don't really understand the motives behind the Edison Group's experiment because they don't make sense to me. I felt that this book could have been longer and covered more ground, though it ended at a good spot. It's just that the overall story doesn't make a great deal of progress here. What I did get was lots of character development, which I love. So no real complaints. ...more", "Title": "The Awakening"},
