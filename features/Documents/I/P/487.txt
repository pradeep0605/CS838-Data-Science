The common thread of said dismissals is a denunciation of '<+++>Vernon God Little</+++>' as a unrealistic portrayal of the tragedy of a school shooting, similar to the incident at Columbine High in Colorado some years ago.

The common thread of said dismissals is a denunciation of '<+++>Vernon God Little</+++>' as a unrealistic portrayal of the tragedy of a school shooting, similar to the incident at Columbine High in Colorado some years ago. The uncommon yet supremely smart and tasteful thread of *my* argument to that is that 'Vernon God Little' is only barely about a school shooting. Someone cites Gus Van Sant's 'Elephant' as a vastly superior study of a tragedy.<---F> Well, yes, that is correct</---F>. Because 'Vernon' isn't a study of a tragedy at all. It is, however, a better overall piece of art than 'Elephant' because that movie was completely boring and had zero count 'em zero actual elephants in it. Or shootings, if I remember correctly. As I seem to have begun this review with a digression, let me interrupt to share with you the quote,<---M> on page 6</---M>, which hooked me: \"Deputy Gurie tears a strip of meat from a bone; it flaps through her lips like a shit taken backwards.\" That's what you call a gem. And there is one on every page of 'Vernon.' People seem to think that 'Vernon' was meant to be to the Columbine Massacre as 'Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close' was to 9/11, or as the documentary 'Terminator 2' was to the coming robot rebellion. But it's not. The school shooting is just an example of the larger malaise and absurdity DBC Pierre is pointing at with 'Vernon.' To even read the first sentence of the synopsis on the inside flap will show that Pierre is aiming a little higher than a recreation of the tragedy. The name of Vernon's Mexican friend that shot 16 kids and them himself is Jesus. Jesus killed a bunch of kids. Jesus is killing YOUR kids. And then killing himself. And Vernon 'God' Little is on the run from the cops. This book has the very rare quality of being wildly funny and startlingly meaningful simultaneously. For this reason,a blurb on the back compares it to 'A Confederacy of Dunces,' and I agree. Although there is much more cursing and sex in 'Vernon,' which makes it automatically better. Pierre also creates the most likable character I've read since, say, the protagonist in John Barth's 'The Floating Opera,' or what his face from 'The Sun Also Rises.' The sort of main character you can't help but want to see succeed. Or even William Stoner from 'Stoner' or Bjartur of Summerhouses from 'Independent People.' Characters who just can't catch a break, even though they probably deserve one. Furthermore, all the narration is in Vernon's \"fucken\" dialect, which might get fucken old if it weren't so goddamn funny and Pierre was less tasteful and skillful with it. But he is, so it only serves to support the reader's warm feelings toward 'Vernon.' The metaphor in 'Vernon' is trashily powerful. Cant' find the page, but something like \"The sky was like a bunch of lint balls on a soggy graham cracker.\" Mmm. Lint. Suffice it to say, you should read this book, and you should should ignore the idea that it is meant to be a paean for the lives lost at Columbine High, because it's not. If you can divest yourself of that thought, you will at *least* have fun reading it, whether you agree with Pierre's assessment of American pop culture or not, because it is a masterful farce. \"You don't know how bad I want to be Jean-Claude Van Damme. Ram her fucken gun up her ass, and run away with a panty model. But just look at me: clump of lawless brown hair, the eyelashes of a camel. Big ole puppy-dog features like God made me through a fucken magnifying glass. You know right away my movie's the one where I puke on my legs, and they send a nurse to interview me instead.\" ...more This one got thrown at the wall in a short space of time.

It starts off with painful cliche caricatures and escalates from there. The subtitle of this book is \"Caricatures R Us\". The author is DBC Pierre and the DBC stands for Dreadfully Boring Caricatures.

I disagree. I do not recommend. I did not enjoy. Now think hard. Think real, fucken hard. That\u2019s what I tell myself. Cept I can\u2019t. Can\u2019t think hard cause I\u2019m too affected.

Fucken scours and stings is what those waves do. Hardest fucken book review I\u2019ll ever try to write, I know that much. I mean, fuck . First thing you need to understand here is that Vernon God Little left me pretty raw. Emotionally speaking, I mean. The book fucken touched something painful in me. It may not touch you that way but it did for me. So it will show in my review, and if you don\u2019t think you can handle my rawness, you can just quit now and go back to watching Court TV or Doctor Fucken Phil or whatever. Turn up the fucken volume so you can\u2019t hear this shit. Second thing is that it ain\u2019t all bad. This was also the funniest damn book I read since A Confederacy of Dunces . The book ends well and, hopefully, so will this review. So this is the part I hate. The part that feels like fucken therapy with Dr. Goosens and his goddamn index finger. Pull down your drawers and spread your fucken cheeks. It\u2019s okay I\u2019m a psychologist which means I\u2019m also a medical doctor. The fuck you are. That\u2019s exit-only down there motherfucker. But I gotta do it if I wanna make bail, you see. I know I\u2019m gonna end up on one a them web sites. Old sick fuckers gettin off on watchin Goosens invade my personal space. But I can\u2019t run to Mexico. I gotta stick it out\u2014no fucken pun intended. I gotta scream \u201c I\u2019m innocent! \u201d before shit gets outta hand. So this is the part where I share my feelings . But so long as you don\u2019t pull out your finger and sniff it, we\u2019re gonna be okay here. Yes we are. Look I\u2019ve said this before and I\u2019ll say it again: I\u2019m not on GoodReads to learn about books . I\u2019m on GoodReads to learn about people . I read all you nice folks\u2019 reviews to learn about you ... about how the book affected you ... what it meant to you. I can learn about the fucken book anywhere. So what kinda asshole am I if I\u2019m not gonna let you learn a little about me ? So here I am. Fuck . And it basically boils down to this one learning I made from this book: we all have our own massacre. You included, that\u2019s right. You just don\u2019t fucken know it yet. It\u2019s there, either happening or waiting to happen. And you\u2019re hoping if nobody sees it then it ain\u2019t real. You\u2019re hoping if you know it\u2019s gonna happen but you don\u2019t tell nobody then it ain\u2019t really gonna happen. But it\u2019s gonna fucken happen. And it\u2019s gonna be fucken real . It sure as hell ain\u2019t your fault, though everybody else sure as hell thinks it is. They look at you sideways, the way people do, but you jackrabbit them and they look away all embarrassed. They ask you the same goddamn questions and it don\u2019t matter how many times you say \u201cI didn\u2019t do it.\u201d And here\u2019s another leaning I made from this book: all those motherfuckers will control you so long as you let them. But you gotta shift the power-dime in your favor. I ain\u2019t gonna tell you how to do it, though. You gotta read the book for yourself, see? So what about me, you\u2019re asking? Am I ever gonna get to the fucken point? Fine. I\u2019ve been putting it off till I made sure you knew that you had your own fucken massacre, too. And I ain\u2019t looking for no damn sympathy, just so you know. My massacre is my pain. Physical pain. Several years ago I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Oh that you say? That shit\u2019s not a real disease. That shit\u2019s an excuse for lazy fuckers who don\u2019t wanna work and like to take prescription pain killers. Well fuck you. You don\u2019t know fucken shit. I bust my ass to provide for my family and run a tight household and I do it in pain every fucken day. And you think I like taking the hard pain meds? You think that\u2019s fun ? Well if that\u2019s what you think then you got your own fucken problems cause it ain\u2019t no fun. Nearly every day I have to choose between being in pain or being high. I\u2019d really rather be neither but most days that isn\u2019t one of the choices. I got my number-2 pencil and my scantron and I look to fill in the bubble for \u201cnone of the above\u201d but it ain\u2019t there. That ain\u2019t no damn fun at all. And like Vernon I get blamed for my massacre; sometimes I feel like I'm fucken on trial for it. But from my point of view I was just in the wrong place at the wrong fucken time. But I told you it would end well, didn\u2019t I? So enough of my fucken problems. This book is full of some really funny shit, ya know? I mean, like, did you think Mr. Dee Bee Cee Pee-Air could write a book about murdered teenagers and betrayal and pedophilia without throwing in some humor? Who the fuck would want to read that? So Vernon God Little is fucken full of humor. Things I never woulda thought about. Like the difference between fuck ing and fuck in and fuck en . There\u2019s three different kinds a people right there. Or like the things you can tell about a woman by the kind of panties she\u2019s wearing. Like where she\u2019s from and where she\u2019s goin, if you get my meaning. Oh and how bout the way Vernon\u2019s whole town is fixated on the Bar-B-Chew Barn ? I mean, are you fucken kidding me? So, look here. The book ends well, this review ends well, and I just have to believe life ends well. I know there\u2019s plenty examples of life not ending well for decent folks. But there\u2019s also plenty examples of things turning out fine for folks who treat people nice and keep their noses out of trouble, and I can\u2019t speak for you, but that\u2019s where I choose to place my hope. Now, let\u2019s talk some more about ladies\u2019 panties ... ...more What\u2019s the Booker Prize, and why did Vernon God Little win it? Ok, let me back up.

The novel\u2019s storyline charts a standard \u201coutside teenage male observing the world\u201d path. Mr. Pierre might want to send the Salinger estate a percentage of his royalties. When people compare this book to Catcher in the Rye , however, I think they\u2019re comparing the two novels because they\u2019re both first-person outsider young adult male narrated, not because they\u2019re of the same quality. Vernon, unlike Holden, lives in Texas with his mother in the wake of a Columbinesque tragedy perpetrated by his best friend. As the town wrestles with the media and insidious desperation for a scapegoat the title character maneuvers a landscape that pins the blame on him mostly, it appears, because he\u2019s not proclaiming his innocence loud enough. He slips from his tract house to Houston to Mexico, encountering shady television producers, the once girl of his dreams, and hermits into amputee porn. The author lapses into a lazy magical realism here and there to cover what seemed like impossible plot developments, but the storyline travels ahead on Pierre\u2019s keen observations that describe, for example, the smell of real life as similar to that of escalator motors. Pierre\u2019s good paragraph to paragraph, really, and I was drawn enough into the plot to read the last eighty pages through a steaming Sunday under the gazebo on the back porch. But the Booker Prize? Isn\u2019t that supposed to be a big deal? Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace won four years before Vernon God Little , and people around goodreads wet their pants over that novel. Fuck me, I don\u2019t know why Vernon God Little won the Booker Prize. Was 2003 a slow literary year? I have a theory about the Booker win that revolves around the assertion (<---B>not particularly well-supported, I must admit</---B>) that the prize committee is based in London, and Vernon God Little could fit a European perception of American white trash international readers might find interesting. Hey, Americans love reading books and watching movies about underdogs mired by birth in depressing circumstances in other countries (think the vastly overrated Slumdog Millionaire ), so why can\u2019t other countries\u2019 cultural consumers pick over our bones and feel superior about small town Texans overeating and shooting each other up? I don\u2019t mind. Texas kind of feels like a foreign country to me, anyway, in part because I\u2019ve only visited once and never left the airport. So I guess Vernon God Little is a decent book with some strong language and excellent passages but the novel doesn\u2019t seem worth mentioning as some big prize winner or one of the thousand books you have to read before you die. And if the Booker Prize committee wants a peek into American white trash culture, I\u2019ll be happy to pick them up at O\u2019Hare and drive them around for a couple hours. Or they could order pizza and watch Cops . Whatever works. We\u2019re here for you, Europe. Thanks for the Booker, even if I\u2019m not sure Mr. Pierre earned it. ...more If I ever start my own barbecue restaurant, I\u2019m definitely stealing the name Bar-B-Chew Barn from this book. Vernon Little has problems. His best friend just killed 16 of their fellow students in a school shooting, and the police suspect he may have been involved.

His mother is more concerned with faking the purchase of a new refrigerator to impress her so-called friends than Vernon\u2019s issues, and a sleazy producer/reporter is trying to turn Vernon into his ticket to stardom by implicating him in the killings. And Vernon is too lost in his own adolescent fantasies and bewildered by the adults around him to convince anyone he\u2019s innocent. Well written and darkly funny with a lot of good satire about small-town Americans and the media, I didn\u2019t enjoy this book much. It wasn\u2019t because of the dark subject matter, it was just because everyone in it is just so goddamn mind-numbingly stupid that it was hard for me to take. And not just stupid, there\u2019s a casual level of indifference and cruelty here that\u2019s also tough to stomach. At times, I found it hard to root for Vernon just because he\u2019s so damn dumb. The last act of the book finally has Vernon growing up and getting a little smarter, but I almost quit on this one halfway through. I can deal with stupid. (I even like Will Farrell movies.) But when there isn\u2019t a single character with 50 IQ points to point out the stupidity, it wears me down. ...more I personally met DBC Pierre last week in TataLitFest in Mumbai. He was shocked to see the first American edition of the book that I posses, he said that was very rare, and now I have that copy author signed as well :P. I must say he is wonderful man, full of life, comedy, wit and down to earth attitude. You don't feel if you are around that he might be a big celebrity or something and I guess this is the right attribute of great people.

You don't feel if you are around that he might be a big celebrity or something and I guess this is the right attribute of great people. I spoke to him around 15 minutes and also said \"I love you\" to him which he translated back. I am very impressed by him. Anyway, now coming up to the book... This is a story of Vernon God Little - a 15 year old fellow who was caught at the wrong time in school when his best friend Jesus killed 15 students in his class and later shot down himself... and now Vernon was the only person who could have any highlight on the case ... Also there was a court case on Vernon because he was the Jesus' best friend and might be also indulged in this ... there was also a sweet mother forcing Vernon to join a job as he is big fellow now. The book all revolves around hypocrisy of media and publicity tantrums and misdirected doings by media channels to get publicity, by hook and crook. Nobody wanted to hear about Vernon's soul. The book is in first of narration of Vernon... I also felt the voice of the protagonist like Holden in 'Catcher in the Rye'(which even I asked DBC Pierre and his reply was 'there was a big gap between the generations) and the movement of story(Which looked to me like 'The Stranger' by Albert Camus: As Vernon in last got the death sentence same as the protagonist in 'The stranger'). Also there was a media channel that proposes in the later half of the book:the reality show based on convicts and gain of votes on sympathy. But I must point out the main USP of the book was the Voice of Vernon which was very comic, satirical, real(although the plot was really pretentious but able to convince in the end) and that was able to slap on society, its gossipy nature, lack of empathy and craving of some individuals to go up to any level for publicity. But I guess you should all read it because every page it seemed VERY ENJOYABLE and while reading the book I had the feeling like I was eating Butterscotch ice-cream ... I really loved it :) And once again my faith on Booker books persists with this one :) Some quotes that I liked : \"Fate always pays attention to what you think, then slams it up your fuc*ing ass.\" \"see me and suffer.\" \"What I definitely learned just now is that everything hinges on the words you use. Does not matter what you do in life, you just have to warp things in right kind of words.\" \"Music is crazy thing when you think about it. sometimes you all get boosted, convinced you are going to win in life, then the song's over and you discover you fuc*en lost ... What happens with sassy music is that you get floated away from yourself, then snap back to reality too hard. The only antidote is just to stay depressed.\" -- Vernon God Little. ...more Another book read for my coming-of-age encyclopedia entry.

Martirio, TX (Martyrdom, Texas) is not without its dunces. That Vernon is always at throes with the law and with himself and with his family makes him effectively endearing to the reader. But the plot's collision with actual modern events (SPOILER) i.e. schoolyard massacres seems too, well, too... contrived? Too stuck-on? A bit like what racism is to a book like \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"--very hidden a theme and embedded, almost invisible--the daily headline-grabbing bloodbath is to a book like \"Vernon God Little.\" ...more Brilliant!

Reality TV shows' take over in later part of the book is a brilliant satire, even though it is not very new. Call me sick, I laughed more with this book than 'P.G Wodehouse' and 'Jerome K Jerome' combined. Oh yeah, the thought process exhibited in this book doesn't look like, as if it is from a 15 year old school kid, more like a 40 year person fed up with his fucken life and people surrounding him. So what? Nobody else cusses like he does. I am positive Holden Caulfield would be proud of this 21st century specimen. Not reading this book is not a sin, you might not miss anything in your life.

Still amazed. Here we are... If you are not got acquainted with American slank, you will feel a little bit annoyed by the excessive use of American teenagers lingo. Obviously, this is a novel that can be included in the Guinnes Book of Records as the novel with most f-word (in all of its forms). I had estimated that at least there would be some 800 f-words in this novel (of course I am using sampling techniques). But, amazingly, seemed that Mr. Dirty But Clean Pierre could read his reader's mind. Unexpectedly, the f-word vanished in the last one-third part of the novel (so I wrong, because I assumed that the population of f-word in this novel is homogenous). I won't tell you why this drastic change happened. You should read it by yourself. It's just amazing, how a little, unimportant thing of using or not using f-word can give impact on the interpretation (yeah, at least for me) of the whole story. Apart from the difficulties with the vocab/lingo, the story is very interesting. Mr. Finlay (the real name of DBC Pierre)surely a good story teller. He can make me engaged to his novel. Actually, I could not help reading the last one-third of this novel some five hours non-stop, while the next day I had a helluva works to do. To make it short (if you want a more detail review, just visit Wiki), this novel is about a 15 (turned to 16) years old boy, Vernon Gregory Little, who was suffered from his best friend's mass-murdering, because of his bowel movement (can't you imagine that???). Opened with the interogation and ended with the revealation of what's really happened, climaxed in the execution process, the novel is just an effortless prose of Mr. Pierre, positioning himself as a nasty, sarcastic, full of angst, yet attracting your sympathy, teenage boy. The phrases, which seemed like a produce of unthoughtful thought, are just mesmerizing, make you ponder hard. \"If things don't happen unless you see them happening, do they still happen if you think they're gonna - but don't tell nobody...?\" Does this sentence really HAVE meaning??? Or is it just a clumsy thought of a depressed teenager? Unanimously, this novel categorized as a dark comedy. You know I'm in a kind of hating a dark story, while I like comedies. But now, I think that I just love the marriage of the two. While sometimes I think the imagination of Mr. Pierre came to wild (isn't it absurd that the people of America chose the one to be executed through SMS voting??? Oh my, I just can't stand it! Right, it is a satirical, dark, comic novel. But, I'm really disturbed by this American Idol parody!), the rest of his imagination, his invention on the use of English words, his playing with G in the middle name of Vernon Little (Vernon Go-to-hell Little, Vernon Godzilla Little, Vernon Gay Little, Vernon Gonzalez Little, etc) showed his genius. If I have to make a comparisons, I can compare this novel to 'Wonderboys' by Michael Chabon. Both stories are messy, while Chabon's can be considered as a civilized novel. This novel can also be compared to Arundhati Roy's \"The God of Small Things\" (no, not because both have the word 'God' in their titles), for its inventive, flexible, experimental use of English words/phrases, while Roy's can be considered as a contemplative one and Pierre's as a not serious one. Finally, my homage to the jury of Man Booker Prize 2003. You certainly know how to pick the winner. (FYI, four of five jury voted for this novel to be the year's winner). ...more This is a challenging read especially for those who are not familiar with Texan way of talking. There are just too many words or phrases that I did not understand while reading and it slowed down my pace, thought of dropping the book, remembering what my brother used to say that \"tiring your eyes is actually reading because reading should have understanding\" and all these made the book less enjoyable.

That's why I am rating this book with a 3 when it could have been an easy 4 or even 5. But with the aid of Wiki, I was able to slowly but surely finished the book. I was able to follow the plot by cheating haha and referring to the book reviews both on or off Goodreads. Why not? At least I finished the book and I thought I understood its message and appreciated its beauty. Beauty this book really has. There is poetry in the prose and yet not the Hallmark-kind of beauty. The sentences are peppered with vulgarity, profanity and obscenity. Yet, there are thought-provoking phrases (Texan vernacular maybe but maybe not as long as it is beautiful) that will prompt you to stop and analyze and think about it for a second. Here is an example: \u201cThe problem with learning the truth about things is that you lose the confidence that comes from being dumb.\u201d This struck me most because it somehow delivered the message of the book. You see this book's main protagonist Vernon is a 15-y/o boy who is suspected to be an accomplish, rather than near-victim of a mass shooting done by his friend Jesus (that's the funny thing about this book, it is not blasphemy because in Mexico or even here in the Philippines some parents think highly of their sons that they name them after our Good Lord Jesus). Then for the two thirds or 3/4 of the book, Vernon depends on the people who he thought he could count on, only to be disappointed. It is only when he takes responsibility of his life (even at that tender age of 16) when he is able to control the situation and his life as a whole. This book also tackles many ills that our society has: proliferation of guns, teenage alienation, dysfunctional families, the justice system and the role of media and the way they tweak the real events just to make money (that reminds me of \"The Bonfire of Vanities). The book is also compared to \"Huckleberry Finn\" and it does have some semblance because of the Vernon's coming-of-age that coincide with his awakening in terms of truth and awareness of what's going on, inclusive of both good and bad, in this world. The teenage angst of Holden Caulfield in \"Catcher in the Rye\" is also evident but Vernon's character has a transformation compared to the consistent characterization Salinger gave to Caulfield. Overall, not my favorite Booker winner but worthy of the prize (I think). Well, I am still to read Margaret Atwood's \"Oryx and Cake\"; Monica Ali's \"Brick Lane\"; Damon Galgut's \"The Good Doctor\"; Zoe Heller's \"Notes on a Scandal\" and Clare Morall's \"Astonishing Splashes of Color.\" My God, I have copies of all those and I got them all from Booksale (a popular second-hand bookshop here in the Philippines). Challenging read but worth your every minute. Just don't give it up in the middle. Finish it because the best \"the redemption\" is in the last part. ...more In general I like reading books about America by non-Americans, both for perspective's sake and to test their veracity. The novel is about a 15-year-old kid whose life unravels after he becomes an unwitting accomplice in a Columbine-like school shooting in a small Texas town. Aside from the hapless Vernon, nearly all of the characters are ignorant, overweight hicks - in other words, a perfect European caricature of South(west)ern America.

That's not entirely divorced from reality, of course, but the boring, mundane truth doesn't sell books and win prizes in foreign countries. (The novel relies on the reader's believing that \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" is a more accurate portrayal of American life than \"King of the Hill.\") Anyway, once I got past my visceral response to its grotesquerie, I kinda liked this. In some places it reminded me a lot of Bob Dylan's \"Chronicles\"; it had that same smart-guy-pretending-to-be-dumb-hick vibe, and whatever idiot-savant pretensions it had would be quickly given away by a flashy metaphor or turn of phrase. As school-shooting books go, I'll take Lionel Shriver's \"We Need to Talk About Kevin\" - or even Jim Shepard's \"Project X,\" which I didn't much care for - over this any day, but it began to gather steam once Vernon escaped from his little hick town. (In order to even get that far, of course, you have to ignore the central implausibility of the book: if a kid was suspected of complicity in a mass murder, they wouldn't just let him out on bail to do as he pleased, and they certainly wouldn't treat him like nothing untoward had happened. Look at what happened with the accessories to Columbine.) I thought the last few chapters were great, mostly because \"Pierre\" abandoned all pretense of plausibility and just let his imagination go nuts. ...more I can understand why people might hate this novel.

Much as I enjoyed the nasty-ass writing native to my home state, and as much as I maintained a steeled adoration of Vernon Gucci/God/Genius/Gregory Little, and as much as I felt my heart swell and drop in its surprisingly pathos-evoking prose, the final chapter punched a star through my jaw and the review. Not that I insist on unhappy endings, but it felt sewn together with the laziness of an attempt to appeal to the reader opposite of the original intentions of the novel. It would've had a much harder-hitting impact had DBC not taken the route he did. Regardless, the voice behind it was realistic enough to make me love Vernon. Which is why I'm so tempted to bump it up a star. But even my Texan ass knows that's irrational. And Texans usually aren't capable of deciding what's irrational.

And what a book it is! In an age where people have come to prefer the brilliant scripts and beautiful cinematography of American television to fiction, Vernon God Little dazzles with its vivid setting, fast-paced storyline, and its amazingly visual style of first-person narrative. It's the Breaking Bad of modern American literature, and very deservingly won DBC Pierre the Man Booker Prize in 2003 (on account of he was a British citizen when he wrote it). The novel is Vernon God Little is a book. And what a book it is! In an age where people have come to prefer the brilliant scripts and beautiful cinematography of American television to fiction, Vernon God Little dazzles with its vivid setting, fast-paced storyline, and its amazingly visual style of first-person narrative. It's the Breaking Bad of modern American literature, and very deservingly won DBC Pierre the Man Booker Prize in 2003 (on account of he was a British citizen when he wrote it). The novel is set in the fictitious town of Martirio (Spanish for 'martyr') in the \"Barbecue Capital\" of Central Texas. Martirio is much like Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's Macondo: a claustrophobic town where everyone's business is everyone's business, and the ordinary turns remarkable. Fifteen-year-old Vernon Gregory Little, the narrator, is suspected to be the gunman in a high school shootout that killed 16 of his classmates, and which he was unwilling witness to. The State implicates Vernon Little for the massacre, and piles circumstantial evidence and half-truth testimonies against him. The television media laps up the prime time crime coverage, often egging on and aiding the investigation. Vernon remains impassive in the midst of it all as he tries to make sense or light of his situation, and plots his escape to Mexico. The novel is sarcastic in its tone and funny in every scene, like your foul-mouthed friend you loved hanging around with when you were fifteen, because he just cracked you up every time. Typical teenage American slang that you tend to read with a Texan twang, the language is colourful and rife with swear words and scatological jokes. Sample this: 'The conversation is nano-seconds away from including the word 'panties', something you should never hear in conversation with your mom. Knowing her, she'd probably say 'underpants' or something. 'Interior wear', or something way f*cken bent.' If you thought Holden Caulfield was a good example of a teenager trapped in a messed-up system, Vernon Little is THE perfect paradigm (or powerdime like Little says), and Vernon God Little is one million times a better read than Catcher in the Rye . The derision of the novel is mostly directed at the ruthless world of tabloid-like television news, and is quite eye-opening. The pace and parlance change three-fourths of the way through the novel: the scene of Vernon's trial had me gripped in my bed and even wanting to skip dinner to finish. The climax is one of the best I have read yet. Vernon God Little is a must-read. If it were not DBC Pierre's debut, and had he ironed out little glitches in his writing, I would give this book nothing less than 5 stars. If you loved Breaking Bad and/or Catcher in the Rye , Vernon God Little is both of these rolled into one. Go pick it up! P.S. Afreen and Ani - this was the best farewell gift I could have asked for.

I may have to give it a 5*! - A quibble: because Vernon is the vessel and outlet for the author's \"stuff he's gotta say\" he's just a bit precocious for a 15-year old. But, somebody's gotta be the spokesperson! An allowance must be made I guess ... - Using \"wisp\" as a verb doesn't work. Finished last night with a slam-bang crazy and oh-so-satisfying, funny and appropriate ending. This ending, however, is just a TAD chaotic and confusing - oh well ... DBC knows what us readers need and want! ...more The author has a terrific turn of phrase, but the plot staggers around like a drunk and eventually falls flat on its face. There's an attempt to fill in some of the plot holes with dollops of magical realism, but this is as unwelcome as it is unsuccessful. Although I was engaged with the characters at the start of the book, I quickly lost any interest in them. It was a struggle to finish.

There's an attempt to fill in some of the plot holes with dollops of magical realism, but this is as unwelcome as it is unsuccessful. Although I was engaged with the characters at the start of the book, I quickly lost any interest in them. It was a struggle to finish. It was a shame; I kept seeing flashes of the brilliant novel this could have been, but these twinkled out of existence as quickly as they appeared. I'm not that surprised it won the Booker Prize. It tends to be a magnet for pseudo-intellectuals. I would also lay a healthy bet that most of the people who voted for it had not read it, just the extracts and publicity material that made it sound the kind of book that ought to win. The author's colourful personal life probably also tickled the fancy of the London literati. I've never bothered to read a Booker winner since. ...more A lot went wrong with this first novel, but the most irritating literary offense for me was the way the not-entirely-authentic-but-still-close-enough-to-be-funny Texas dialect gets away from Pierre and spins off into pure nonsense. Combine hyperbolic pidgin Texas vernacular with a cheerfully misogynist, wholly unlikable narrator, and you get sentences like this: \"I surf her upholstery with my nose, map her sticky heem along glimmering edges to the panty-leg, where the tang sharpens like slime-ac A lot went wrong with this first novel, but the most irritating literary offense for me was the way the not-entirely-authentic-but-still-close-enough-to-be-funny Texas dialect gets away from Pierre and spins off into pure nonsense. Combine hyperbolic pidgin Texas vernacular with a cheerfully misogynist, wholly unlikable narrator, and you get sentences like this: \"I surf her upholstery with my nose, map her sticky heem along glimmering edges to the panty-leg, where the tang sharpens like slime-acid chocolate, stings, bounces me back from her poon.\" Ew. Also, what? It gets worse. Think The Chocolate War if it were longer, more bloated with pretentious notions of itself as literature, more anti-feminist, and about a school shooting. Yikes. ...more This book is in the category I think of as 'American Filmic Male First Person'. I've had it for ages, but was put off by the fact that the 'DBC' stands for 'dirty but clean' and the fact that Pierre sounded like such an egotistical cockbadger on the radio. It's quite engaging, but not quite engaging enough. It reads as though the author has watched a lot of TV and movies, but not read many books (apart from Catcher in the Rye) or met many people.

I'm astonished that it won the Booker, though they do tend to dole out awards to anything about drugs or ethnic minorities; both terra incognita to the judging panel, presumably. It's clever, but reads as though the Simpsons producers had made an X-rated version about a school shooting, only with less rounded characters. ...more<---A>D.B.C. Pierre</---A><---C>D.B.C.
