I see the cover and remember first holding it in my hands and not knowing I was in for a magical experience. My eyes scan the description and I get goosebumps as I'm taken back into the story, feeling echoes of the emotions I felt once again. Then I glance down... and see my \"review\". That's when I start to wonder how I possibly made it through high school English. I mean, really. Some of the words I used aren't even words. Which is totally unacceptable for a book - a trilogy, in fact - as fantastic as this one. And it is amazing. I have read all three books several times and count them amongst my all time favourites,<---M> across all genres</---M>, adult, YA or otherwise. It shouldn't be so incredible - an adventure/survival story about a thirteen year-old boy and his dog doesn't sound so impressive - but, oh, it's just so much deeper, thought-provoking, sad, funny, chilling... everything than you would imagine. It's one of the most rich, meaningful stories I've ever read. It tells the story of Todd, the last boy in Prentisstown, who will become a man on his 13th birthday. Prentisstown, though, is not your average town - everyone in the town is male and they can hear one another's thoughts (<---B>called \"noise\"</---B>). In a town like this, you'd think keeping a secret would be impossible. But we soon find out that noise can lie and that Prentisstown has some very dark secrets. What really happened to the women of Prentisstown? What lies on the other side of the swamp? And why is it so important that Todd, just one boy, reaches his birthday and becomes a man? It's a novel with fantastic characters and possibly my favourite animal character ever. And it's built on some seriously dark themes. You might not expect that from a YA book promising talking animals and adventure, but there are underlying themes of dehumanization, colonization, slavery, racism and sexism. And - as if that wasn't enough - it's a ridiculously addictive pageturner that demands you pick up the sequel immediately after (I'm warning you). When I try to put words together for the books I really love, they never seem like enough. I read back over my review and get frustrated because nothing I say seems to capture that inexplicable pull of wonder, excitement, horror and delight that was flooding through me while I read the book. I'm sorry for that. At least, though, I have written a better review than before. You may be thinking \"that's a bit arrogant of her to come along and say that this is a better review\". But, really, you should have seen the last one.

(LAFFTER!) but seriously, folks. i don't even know where to start with this book. i really thought it was going to be a low-impact tale of a boy's adventure's through a damaged land with some sort of eventual self-discovery and that it would have good action sequences and some obvious metaphors and blah-di-blah and people said it was sad, so i figured someone would die at some point. well. understatement in all of the above. this was much richer and deeper and so very dark. ness touches upon the problems of colonization and group mentality and dehumanization and helplessness and loyalty with a skill for storytelling and characterization, and always skirting that fine line between emotion and sentimentality. it has been awhile since i have been immersed in a book. this world - these characters - it consumed me. it is so hard to talk about books that do this to me. it is easy to pick apart books that are \"good\" or \"okay\" or \"the worst\", but the ones that i fall into - the ones that i hate having to put down for anything as mundane as sleep or work, those are incredibly difficult to put into words. but \"mmmmmm\" comes close. i think todd is a very solid character. there are times when he makes unfortunate decisions, but they always seem consistent in terms of his character, and the background from which he is coming. there is such an opportunity for growth in him, but you know, despite anything that may happen, he is trying to do the right thing, as he sees it; as he is learning what \"the right thing\" even is. i mean, he's twelve-thirteen, right? and he is a lot more resourceful and insightful than i was at that age, and i didn't have to go around hearing everyone's thoughts all the time. oh, did i forget to talk about the plot again? quickly - everyone can hear everyone's thoughts. all the time. even the most mundane, subconscious, or embarrassing ones. even thoughts of animals. but not, however, the thoughts of women. we are still mysterious. todd grows up in an all-male town, but soon will leave and discover... well, he will discover a lot. better you read it than i tell it. aaron is a little...unrealistic,sure, but after a while, you gotta sort of do that horrified slow-clap at his stubbornness and persistence, right? it is impressive, if nothing else. viola. great here. even better in the second book. mmmmmmmmm talking animals. yeah, i usually don't like it either. however, these animals talk exactly how animals should talk. they don't have conversations; they have a limited vocabulary that seems appropriate, and can be so heartbreaking in certain situations, oh my god. manchee is the best dog in literature. his voice is exactly right. very reminiscent of the dog in up , and although he has a small range of words at his disposal,his emotions come across loud and clear.it is a wonderful relationship, despite todd not wanting a dog and resenting him at the beginning of the book, the two of them, through their adventures, become the best \"boy and his dog\" team i can think of. definitely have the second book on hand to pick up immediately after finishing the first one. you are going to need it. i can't imagine how people reading this when it was new had to suffer - to have to wait for the next book to be published. this is the mother of all cliffhangers. or, at least, it was until i finished the second book yesterday. it is even worse. in terms of agonizingly wonderful cliffhangers. ** although i am looking closer now, and i am realizing that my math is all wrong (i thought those numbers seemed low)- but that this time it is not my fault. when did goodreads.com change things up so that all the reviews are together at the bottom, regardless of whether or not the are reviews by your friends. isn't the whole point of having \"friends\" that you have created this trusted community of readers whose values you respect? now i have to scroll through the three or four people on this site who aren't my friends to see the reviews of people whose opinions matter to me? this is insane! and it isn't even arranged by number of votes or anything - it is just - here are a ton of reviews - have fun finding the useful ones (like this one, surely!) in a sea of stranger danger. i hope this is just a temporary thing that is happening because it is taking one of the strengths specific to goodreads and pooing (\"poo, todd!\") all over it. ...more Things that didn't bother me: The grammar and misspellings - normally this would bother me, but I quickly got used to it, so I don't fault him there.

The cliffhanger - maybe if I didn't have a copy of the second book on hold at the library I would be upset, but cliffhangers don't normally bother me. It is a doozy though. Things that did bother me: The unlikeable main character, Todd Aaron the Energizer Bunny - 'nough said. The two senseless deaths - one made me start bawling and set the book down, wondering if I could continue on. I had a friend say to me that Ness must be a great author if he can incite so much passion from me; if you take a look at my updates you can see how up and down I was, but is it a good book if for the most part all it did was make me pissed off? Is any emotional response at all the sign of a good writer? I don't think so. I think if you make me hate your characters and the actions that they take to the point where I don't care if they survive, you haven't been all that successful. You have to give me someone to root for. I wasn't even all that attached to Viola, and she's the only character who actually did the RIGHT thing by the end of the book. The way the author just kept piling onto the characters was absolutely ridiculous. Seriously, how many bad things can you think of to put your characters through? It got to the point where it was all so implausible that, much to my chagrin, I could guess each and every time the villain was going to jump out and attack Todd and Viola. It got so predictable that I just kept getting angrier and angrier each time it happened. His characters talk about hope so much in this book, yet I felt like Ness never gave me any. Was it the worst book in the world? No, not by any means. I can't give it more than 1 star though, because 2 stars means: \"it was ok.\" This book was NOT ok. I didn't like it, nor enjoy it, but that doesn't mean I won't check out the next book to see what happens. In this, Ness has succeeded, but only because I can always get the next books out from the library. ...more Boy oh boy.

Here's the cut-n-paste) This review will, by necessity, have lots of spoilers, because the things I liked (and disliked) are very specific. Insofar as I can give you something spoiler-free, here goes: I love the concept; the world is unique and well-realized; the relationship between the main characters is believable and well-developed; there is a wonderfully realized dog; the narrative voice is a bit irritating; there are whole pages you can just skip because there\u2019s nothing worth reading on them; there is quite a bit of extremely graphic violence; the author CHEATS most egregiously at narrative; while the overall message of the book is solid and good and right, I hate the way we get there; the villains are completely eye-rolling over-the-top; and it ends on a giant cliffhanger. It is the best of books, it is the worst of books. I seem unable to speak of it except in gross hyperbole. Here come the spoilers: First of all, a salute to the best character in the whole damn book, the dim-witted and noble hound, Manchee. He was such a good dog, and a good depiction of a dog. His death was heartbreaking, and maybe that\u2019s my real problem with the book: I will never forgive the author for killing him off. I thought the relationship between Todd and Viola was also handled well. Their friendship followed a realistic trajectory. Yes, Todd is protective of her, but Viola\u2019s as tough as he is \u2014 plus smarter \u2014 and I felt she held her own pretty well. Todd, having been raised in a world without women, has few preconceived notions about what women should do or be, or what the male-female dynamic is supposed to be. He treats her as a friend and equal, hardly an inkling of sex or romance in his head. The scene where he realizes that he can tell what she\u2019s thinking and feeling, even though he can\u2019t hear her Noise, is \u2014 for my money \u2014 the best thing in the entire book, a genuine, human moment of recognition. The whole \u201cendless fleeing punctuated by extreme danger\u201d plot, however, I found utterly tedious. I think I have Mortal Danger fatigue when it comes to YA. I\u2019m choosing to blame Hunger Games \u2014 not that I didn\u2019t like Hunger Games, but when I heard that the second volume was basically Hunger Games II, I decided I didn\u2019t need to read that one. The other book this reminded me of is Graceling, where she\u2019s fleeing over the mountain pass with Bitterblue, and it\u2019s just endless page after page of running! And surviving! And OMG the tedium of the endless chase and getting more and more sick and injured and will they survive? WILL THEY?! That part of this book made me cross-eyed with boredom. Also: the villains made me want to poke my eyes out with the ubiquitous knife. They\u2019re CRAYZEH! And they\u2019re indestructible! And did we mention CRAYZEH? No subtlety to evil here, no nuance. No temptation. No point. But y\u2019know, I could have forgiven both those flaws. I really could have. I forgave them in Hunger Games, after all (though the evil was more nuanced there, in my opinion, and less CRAYZEH). There were two things I can\u2019t forgive. One: the way the killing of the spackle was handled. OK, I get that it\u2019s supposed to be some kind of commentary on how people can be brainwashed into hating, and scapegoating people, and it parallels what happened with the women in the town, and blah de blah. But it was incredibly jarring, then brushed off like no big deal (by Viola and then by <---C>Ben</---C>), conveniently forgotten when Todd needs to be \u201cnot a killer\u201d, but then retrieved to illustrate the overarching Eden theme? Todd is still somehow \u201cpure\u201d and \u201cinnocent\u201d \u2014 right? Because if he\u2019s not, then what\u2019s the showdown with Aaron about? Why can\u2019t he just say to Aaron, hey, I already killed someone? Wouldn\u2019t Aaron have self-destructed, now that he can\u2019t be the sacrifice? But then again, Todd\u2019s NOT pure and innocent because he gives Viola that speech about how we all fall, and we all get up again \u2014 a speech which I would have taken for another genuine human moment except FALLING = KILLING PEOPLE (or spackle), and no, we don\u2019t ALL do that. They\u2019re reaching really hard for some kind of Garden of Eden metaphor, and I\u2019m just not buying it. Two: the misuse and abuse of first person present tense, and by extension, of the reader\u2019s trust and goodwill. Just like Hunger Games, where it was used to excellent effect, this book is in first person present tense. The entire POINT of first person present tense is to make it feel like you are there, as close as you can possibly be to experiencing AS the narrator. If that\u2019s the case, then I think it\u2019s cheating to have the narrator say, essentially, \u201cThen he told me the truth and it was so awful I couldn\u2019t believe it\u201d \u2014 without revealing anything to the reader. NO YOU DON\u2019T. I would accept the narrator dissociating, or doing some version of \u201clalala I can\u2019t hear you!\u201d such that he doesn\u2019t completely hear what\u2019s said either. But I cannot accept that he is told something, IN REAL TIME, and he has the option of keeping it from the reader. This isn\u2019t a journal he\u2019s writing after the fact. This is his experience, IN REAL TIME, and he doesn\u2019t get to edit it that way. It\u2019s like the author couldn\u2019t think of any other way to create suspense. The character had to know, so he\u2019d get out of town, but if the READER knew, that would spoil the surprise. You can do that in third person. You can do that in first person past tense. I do not accept it as fair play here. The Big Reveals, when they come, are utterly anticlimactic. Nothing you couldn\u2019t have guessed; I guessed, and then rejected it as too obvious. My version had mind control and cyborgs (TELL me Aaron\u2019s not a cyborg!), and I liked it better. Would I read the next one? This, I do not know. I feel like I spent a lot of time complaining here, and didn\u2019t really elucidate all the things I liked: the world, the premise of Noise, all the possibilities of a frontier planet, Wilf, the singing cow-things. There were things here I liked. If I had some assurances that the next one wasn\u2019t a rehash of this one (the way Hunger Games II sounds like it is), then maybe. There were ideas here. Poorly executed, some of them, but still. I think part of the reason the bad parts made me so mad was that I really liked the good parts. ...more 3.5 stars Forever crying because \"Todd?\" Some books make you confused . Conflicted.

Oh, shut up ) to \"bad romance heroin\" (freaking insta-love, I said) so quickly? \u2460 The writing . I must admit, I was a little worried when I opened this book. I mean, what could be more difficult to read for a French reader than slang ? I have this horrible memory of being totally lost when I read this awful book, you know, Inescapable . OMG THAT MESS. Long story short : it was horrible there was a character that I could not understand at all because of his accent, and it was SO. FUCKING. ANNOYING. Anyway - Given the clich\u00e9s and other creepy stalkers' fantasies, we parted ways quickly. I am not (always) a masochist But this one? I wanted to enjoy it. And thanks to the perfect writing, that was the case. All the sentences are fluid , and even if I know it annoyed some readers, I loved the rhythm and the orality of Todd's voice . I loved the repetitions. <---A>Patrick Ness</---A> took a risk, but it was splendidly executed . \u275d There's just no such thing as silence. Not here, not nowhere. Not when yer asleep, not when yer by yerself, never. I am Todd Hewitt , I think to myself with eyes closed. I am twelve years old and twelve months old. I live in Prentisstown on New World. I will be a man in one month's time exactly . \u275e *whisper* I must confess that I often talk to my books. Yeah, I know, they're not really alive and all that stuff. But you know? My weird habit makes me enjoy every tiny wink the narrator directs to the reader (except if I HATE that narrator, but it's a story for another day *cough* The Player and the Pixie *cough*). In The Knife of Never Letting Go , all these \"You see?\" are well used. Perhaps I answered sometimes. Okay, Always . But Todd is so alone, I was sorry for him, OKAY ?! Now, this structure . The chapters are short. And that's completely subjective, but I love when a book is organized that way, even though I barely can explain why. It increases the rhythm, maybe? HUH. Moving on. \u2461 Todd and Viola . Oh, you, little boy who can't kill and can't think straight with all that noise and feels so lonely, you've won me from the first page (insta-love, remember?). What can I say? I loved Todd. Really. Okay, he can't stop complaining sometimes but hey! He's just a kid who lives in a rude rude world, trying to go on, and go on, to find hope even if it seems more impossible than a child's dream. Throughout the story, we have the chance to be witnesses while he's growing up, becoming a man of whom we can be proud. All of his feelings seem so real , so understandable , I couldn't help but feel my heart actually ache for him. I cared about him, and above that, I was there , with him, and with Viola as well. Viola , who's exactly how I like my heroines : smart, loyal, outspoken. I couldn't choose a better partner in crime for Todd. (view spoiler) [And she'd better be alive in the second book, or I may become really angry (hide spoiler) ] . \u275d I lean down again and (shut up) I cry, I cry, I'm crying but it has to pass cuz I have to figure it out, I have to figure it out, it's down to me, there's only me, I have to find a way, I have to save her, I have to save- \u275e \u2462 Manchee .

You know the locution, \"a dog is man's best friend\"? That says it all. In the beginning of the book, we're stuck with Todd's opinion, which is basically that his dog is stupid. Freaking dumb. He considers that Manchee is useless, and it took me some chapters, I must admit (Sorry sorry Manchee), but there was a moment I thought, \"Listen Todd, you're great, but you're fucking WRONG\" . Because this dog? He's loyal and definitively not a coward. A MEDAL FOR MANCHEE. WHO'S ON? To be short : I loved this dog, I often wanted to heal him and pat him and say him that he was a wonderful dog. Yes. I'm not exaggerating. At all . \u275d He's a good bloody dog, have I said that? \u275e (view spoiler) [I cried for Manchee. I couldn't help it. I cried. That was so unfair! (hide spoiler) ] And who doesn't want to understand his dog's barks? I'm asking, WHO?

Cats . *roll eyes* \u2463 The plot and the world building . When I started The knife of Never letting go , I haven't a damn clue what the world created by Patrick Ness was. Maybe that's why I felt more and more amazed as I went along in my reading . Honestly? That's brilliant . The New World is complex, fearsome and yes, there is a real plot here. I know, I know . I'm excited too. I don't want to spoil you, so the only thing I'll say it's this : Read this book, but plan enough free time, because you won't be able to put it down until the end. But I must complain : what was that freaking ending? Do you know we, readers, have to work and to actually sleep? I'm speechless right now. That was brilliant, really, and blew me away because I was too smug, I thought I could see where the story went, but I was far away from the true. Don't get me wrong, it's awesome and I admire Patrick Ness for this but wow. That was rude. Todd and Viola's story was excruciating , mind-blowing, even hard to stand at some point, yet filled with such gems of awesomeness I often find myself thinking about it, reliving it - Here's a book which moved me in a way no other could. *picking The Ask and the Answer from my bookcase* For more of my reviews, please visit: [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more Seriously?

I felt that this book picked up really quickly, and will demand your attention, with action and suspense that keep you constantly guessing. The adventure in this book is amazing. Todd's being chased, he's learning new things every minute, and finding out about all of the untruths he's been grown up to believe. The plot is moves so quickly, but there are a few slow parts that I struggled through. Not many, though. The ideas here are very creative, especially in regards to the noise. It was interesting to see what animals would have to say (not much of interest, actually) and how differently the various characters Todd encounters along his journey have dealt with the problem of broadcasting their thoughts. As far as characters go, it was easy to feel for them, because they felt very real. Todd has flaws that make him more loveable in my opinion. Manchee, his dog is another fun character that made me laugh. The concept of this book was just so unique. The writing is well done, despite the fact that Todd's thoughts were often not grammatically correct. It was annoying reading through them in the very beginning, but then it get's quite easier to read after a few pages. I cruised through this book thinking it was going to be rated 4 stars...until the ending. The narrative is dark, but the ending is even darker and, it's an emotional sucker punch. The book has one brilliant cliff-hanger ending that will make you want to immediately get book two. This book truly impressed me. Recommended to all action, adventure, dystopian lovers. ...more Ugh, you can't leave me with that ending!

Todd likes to go to the swamp to collect apples, because it is the only place where he can get a break from men\u2019s \u201cNoise\u201d \u2013 their secrets, their thoughts, their memories. While out on a walk with his talking dog, Manchee, Todd encounters a break in the Noise, a pocket of silence. When Todd and Manchee return home, their Noise reveals what happened in the swamp, and Todd, with Manchee, a packed bag, Ben\u2019s big hunting knife, and his mom\u2019s journal, is sent away from the only home he\u2019s ever known. When Todd encounters a girl on his travels, and comes across towns filled with men and women, everything he\u2019s ever known about the world is changed in an instant. The men of Prentisstown are harboring a terrible secret and will stop at nothing to get Todd back. I really wanted to love this story. It won several major literary awards, including the 2008 Tiptree Award, and a few of my Goodreads friends enjoyed it. I had reservations about reading this, because it is the first in a series and I knew it had a cliffhanger ending. It wasn\u2019t a bad book. It took me just a few pages to get used to Todd\u2019s language that reveals his innocence and lack of education. At the same time, he is a very well-developed character, with strong sensibilities, hope, and a will to survive. From the start, Viola and Todd are bonded together in a quest for freedom and survival. There is no romance, for which I am thankful. Since Viola doesn\u2019t have any Noise, she is shrouded in silence. It takes a little longer for Todd to get to know her, but he eventually does and is able to read her thoughts. The development of Todd\u2019s and Viola\u2019s relationship is my favorite part of this story. One thing I am bothered about is there was no mention at all of Ben\u2019s and Cillian\u2019s relationship. Were they roommates, best friends, lovers? Why was the nature of their relationship kept a secret, while everyone else\u2019s thoughts were laid open? Since they were such a significant part of Todd\u2019s life, I would have liked to know more. The Knife of Never Letting Go was fast-paced, dark, and compelling. I liked the plot, the suspense, the world, and the concept of hearing every man\u2019s thoughts while women\u2019s are much more difficult to read. I would have liked more well-developed secondary characters and less chase scenes. The story engaged my emotions, made my heart race, and left me exhausted. It also left me feeling vaguely empty and unsatisfied. I knew about the cliffhanger at the end, but nearly every chapter had a cliffhanger as well. At times I felt I was watching a TV show instead of reading a book. And I won\u2019t even talk about Aaron, the charismatic preacher of Prentisstown, who was one of the most one-dimensional characters I\u2019ve ever encountered in YA fiction. ...more Complete, Edited and without effing Spoilers!

My Non-Spoiler Effing Hook Review A-reading this book is like a-watching the vids Paranormal Activity! - Joyzi Ahm ruddy don effing know where to start my effing review so I just tell yoo the story of me a-reading this book The Knife of Never Letting Go by Patrick Ness. So at first I picked this book up cuz lotsa my friends here in GR are a-talking about it. Lotsa them rated the hook 5 stars btw so cuz of all the hype I decided to fin\u2019lly readit. (ruddy evil hype, shut up!) Then ya I read the book and then this effing happens, effing happens, effing happens- 0--------------------------------------------------------------------100 (Wadda eff is that line? you effing asking) That effing line btw is a representayshun of my undying love to Adrian Ivashkov *coughs* patience line while ahm starting to read the book. Tho by the end of Chapter 2 my patience line goes like this- 0 Interpretayshun: Joyzi's mood: a-blazing fury [Image: pissed off cat] I have to admit that before a-reading this I tot that Pretties by Scott Westerfield was the most horribly written and a-annoying kinda writing style I ever read in my entire effing life hut boy I was so wrong! Cuz reading the first two chapters of Patrick Ness\u2019 book is much more annoying as hell ! Evaluashun twixt the two: Pretties: >The Pretty Talk- fond of a-using bubbly, bogus, a-dizzy-making, a-pretty-making, ouching, a-oxygen-missing etc etc etc\u2026 >Character pet names- a-adding la or wa at the end e.g. Tally-wa, Shay-la, Zane-la The Knife of Never Letting Go > aka The Book of Typos > Misspelled words and grammatical errors that will surely make a Grammar Nazi effing end his/her life >neologisms that just made me infuriated like Ahm a-having a PMS or a-something >Redundancy- the author was fund of repeating what he writes three times as ifs yer dumb. Redundancy- the author was fund of repeating what he writes three times as ifs yer dumb. Redundancy- the author was fund of repeating what he writes three times as ifs yer dumb.

[Image: pissed off cat] I ruddy wanna kill the author at that point and I was like a-yelling, \u201cSeriously ifs I ever see yoo Patrick Ness in person I gonna give yoo an effing dictionary!\u201d Tho I still keep on a-reading it hoping that it will get better but no it was so horrendously written chapters after chapters that my mind was screaming, \u201cSunupahur! Someone effing enroll this guy in Writing101 or Ahm going to ruddy let you be eaten by crocs!\u201d Still I a-reading it, a-reading it, a-reading it tho half of the book I was so effing angry at it due to these reasons- > The book was an effing alien story. If yoo happen to read my review of I Am Number Four yoo probably already know that I already have my mental note to myself a-saying: MENTAL NOTE TO SELF: Don't ever read something about ALIEN again >The hook lacks sexual tenshun eeeeeeeer romance . Oh okay *coughs* this one was a problem of the reader rather than the book. This might seem pretty shallow or whatever hut I really find hooks who lacks a love story a tad boring. I reckernize similarities from The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins when Viola treated Todd's wounds and that reminds me of Katniss a-treating Peeta's wound too hut the difference about them is that in THG it is romancey unlike in this book. >The character Viola at first didn't speak like she's kinda mute and I hate that parts too because I really don't get her character at all like what's her purpose if she isn't speaking? >This was a chase story hut Todd and also the reader have no effing clue why the main character was chase by armies from Prentiss Town. And for most parts the story draaaaaaaags and it was effing plotless, plotless, plotless-- >There's a scene wherein Todd can't effing read his Ma's book and for some reason this reminds me of this vids: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7AvpZ... (laugh guys, it's only a joke shut up!) And then a-reading the second half of the book I started to like it cuz of this- GORE I effing love GORE ! Can't yoo tell? [Image: Joyzi a-turning round and round with showers of petals a-falling on her] Yeah gore gives me that adrenaline rush it's like my heart goes thump badda thump badda thump badda baddda baddda thump- And it's like the feeling of a-reading The Hunger Games came back to me and I effing love this hook already! *okay stop with this creepiness (shut up, shut up!)* And secondly I effing love this because of Manchee - I'm a dog person btw- And these are my pups, ifs you effing care- [Image: Joyzi's dog Hachi being coerced to have a picture taken, the pup is scared of the camera flash btw so that explains her pose (someone ruddy calls the PETA! shut up!)] [Image: Joyzi's dog Dango, haven't got a problem with this one, she effing loves it when someone takes a photo of her, she's a narcissist] And then an effing miracle happens! (Feedback loop works crechers!) Joyzi changed her mind! (Hallelujah!) Joyzi now- >Loves the writing ergo it deserve the spot on my \"writing-style-i-adore\" shelf- For it was original and amazingly clever! >Loves this alien story, this one seems surprising since aliens are not my cuppa tea. This was the first time I enjoyed a-reading something like it because I never really like The Host by Stephenie Meyer and I am Number Four by Pittacus Lore. It was just a breath of fresh air, all the ideas that are into this book and all the descriptions and rules of the planet I love'em all! >Loves Viola and Todd's relationship. It may not be as romancey as Peeniss tandem(that effing means PeetaxKatniss) in THG but it was just a sweet friendship I s'pose. Like they protect each other and they comfort each other and they are just there for one another and it doesn't feel contrived at all. It feels natural, how their relashunship builds and grows. >Empathize with Todd being illiterate. Oh honey I hate myself! I felt like I misjudge his character and when I know more about Todd he reminds me of Liesel Meminger from the Book Thief and Zero from the Holes. I mean I really don't know why I'm so hard on him at first hut then I realize he's just so vulnerable and I wanted to protect him and root for him. I just felt so bad I was so wrong about him and for that he's certainly one of those characters I will never ever forget. And he kinda reminds me of Peeta btw he's so like my Pita bread. Like his problem is he can't effing kill another person just like Peeta's dilemma on THG. Okay thassall I don't wanna spoil things hut I just wanna say that the twist in this book is a very disturbing event that even right now I can't stop a-thinking 'bout it. It was so sick and repulsive. I don't know how to really express my feelings about it. Just read the book and yoo'll be the judge. It will definitely keep you thinking and thinking and thinking and thinking- It will keep yer heart racing- It will blow yer mind- One of the best book ever, second to Hunger Games I s'pose!- There are just three things that I wanted right now- One. I wanted yoo to read the book. Two. I wanted to read the second book right now. And. Three. I wanted an effing movie! -Fin-! ...more Hard to know how to rate this book. It is amazing and powerful, but so sad it made me angry and made me not want to recommend it to anyone. If you're up for a punch in the stomach. . . here's your book. Edit: I originally rated this book 2.5 stars, but on further consideration, it is more of a 1.5-2 star book for me. The writing and themes explored in this book are excellent. The writing style is unique and part of the world building in a lot of ways. I found the actual plot, particularly the \"twists\", as well as the characters, especially the villains, to be lacking.

Everyone should read it and bless their sights with its glorious pages. I have nothing else to say. The majority of my friends loved this book! But, I didn't and I hate that I didn't! I love Patrick Ness but this book just wasn't for me and I won't be reading the rest of the trilogy. I will continue to read Patrick Ness books =) I loved the whole concept of the book and it was cray.

Told through the candid and youthful perspective of a twelve year old boy on the cusp of manhood, The Knife of Never Letting Go presents an incredibly unique plot that's both simple in its storytelling and layered in its depth. Todd is the youngest boy in a society consisting solely of men, and this is his normal: The Noise. As a result of a potent \"Noise germ\" released during war, every man in town can physically hear the thoughts and intentions of every other man around for miles, as well as every animal. Todd was born into this world of Noise, so consequently knows no other way of life. The Noise plagues him as most of the men's thoughts are deceitful, impure, and vengeful. When Todd is urged to flee town, he quickly learns that he represents something valuable to these men; something they'll go to any length to obtain. This book had a slow start that gradually evolved into tons of action; plenty of chasing/running, and an all around fight for survival. Todd's inherently 'good' and loyal nature conflicts with his need to survive at all costs\u2014igniting an internal war in the midst of all external struggles. The romance incorporated was more of a vague insinuation; young, gentle and based purely on perseverance. However, the connection between Todd and Viola steadily progressed alongside the plot. What I loved most about this story was its genuine, unfiltered voice; Todd's perspective was youthful and portrayed in a believable and refreshing manner. However, as young and inexperienced as his character appeared in writing, his thoughts and actions were every bit as honorable and profound\u2014which felt like the sweetest contradiction. He was a loyal, inspirational hero, and singlehandedly brought messages of never letting go or losing hope, to life. I must mention the phenomenal ending, which was hands-down incredible. It became a pivotal point of the story, and intensively pushed the plot into new territory. There is a huge cliffhanger, but luckily the series is complete ... and I look forward to seeing where this story goes. I think everybody falls ... I think maybe we all do. And I don't think that's the asking. I think the asking is whether we get back up again.

The essay: \u201cToo much informayshun becomes just Noise.\" - Dialects and Slang on New World If you were to ask a group of people what kind of superpower they would like to have, there would definitely be at least one person who would like to be able to hear everybody's thoughts. This person should read \u201cThe Knife of Never Letting Go\u201d (2008) by American-born British author Patrick Ness and possibly reconsider this answer. Set on New World, a planet where men can hear other men's thoughts in a constant stream of Noise, this story is narrated by 12-year-old Todd Hewitt, a boy who must flee from his settlement called Prentisstown. The author uses distinctive dialects for Todd and the other people he encounters on his way, in order to emphasize the contrast and conflicts between the different settlements on New World, while especially focusing on the protagonist's dialect as a means of indicating his rural background and lack of education. \u201cThe Knife of Never Letting Go\u201d is a Young Adult science-fiction book and the first installment in the \u201cChaos Walking\u201d trilogy. Prentisstown is a small rural settlement on New World that is only inhabited by men, since all women were killed by a germ released by an alien species that also caused men to be able to hear each other's thoughts in the ever-present Noise. Shortly before the protagonist Todd Hewitt is to come of age and become a man in his hometown, he is forced to flee with his dog Manchee after he discovers a patch of silence from the Noise. This \u201chole in the Noise\u201d (p. 13) is soon discovered to be caused by a girl named Viola and quickly, they all find themselves on the run from an army of Prentisstown men. The story is narrated by Todd Hewitt in present tense, using mostly short lines and repetitions, in order to dramatize the urgency of the situations the characters are confronted with. However, Todd's voice and his constant use of dialect and slang words is arguably the most distinctive part of the narrative. He uses a wide range of vocabulary that is considered to be non-standard language. Todd often abbreviates words, something that is commonly known in today's spoken language, for example, he makes frequent use of \u201ccuz\u201d, \u201ctho\u201d, \u201cain't\u201d, \u201coutta\u201d, \u201cgotta\u201d, and many other abbreviations. Some of his vocabulary is entirely made up or derived from another word, and thus, grammatically incorrect, as Todd often speaks of an \u201casking\u201d (p. 422), which is derived from the verb \u201cto ask\u201d, when he means a question. Todd's illiteracy also plays a major role in the story. The rural setting of New World and the lack of education in Prentisstown is highlighted from the beginning, as Todd himself mentions that the residents of New World have always focused on survival rather than education. Since Todd cannot read or write, his storytelling sounds very colloquial and unconventional, and he often spells words the way they are pronounced. For example, while Todd calls it an \u201cexpanshun\u201d, Viola, who is more educated than Todd, spells it correctly as \u201cexpansion\u201d (p. 183). Throughout the novel, Todd's dialect and his way of speech is put in contrast to the dialects of various other people he encounters on his journey. First, he meets Viola, a young girl that has survived a crash on New World with a small space ship, while both of her parents have died. She comes from Old World (often implied to be Earth), has a very clear pronunciation and does not speak in any dialect. On multiple occasions during the course of the story, she imitates the dialect of the people on New World, since she is forced to disguise her real origin for her and Todd's safety. By the end of the book, she has grown accustomed to all of the differing dialects on New World and has even acquired some of Todd's slang words. While running from the army of Prentisstown men, Viola and Todd also encounter a lot of people from various other settlements with different dialects and vocabulary. One can clearly see that the thickness of a settlement's dialect directly relates to the level of technological development of said settlement. When they meet two characters called Wilf and Jane, who are from a very rural settlement that specializes in farming, their accent is described as extremely heavy. For example, they place the prefix \u201ca-\u201d in front of verbs (\u201ca-doing\u201d, p. 132), replace the \u201cI\u201d with an \u201cAh\u201d-sound (p. 310) and have an even wider range of newly derived vocabulary than Todd. However, when Todd and Viola come across a settlement called Carbonel Downs, the residents have only slight accents, which Todd notices immediately, as he says their \u201caccent's the closest to Viola's [\u2026] [he's] ever seen on the New World\u201d (p. 355). Consequently, Carbonel Downs is described as a very technologically advanced settlement with a functioning infrastructure. In \u201cThe Knife of Never Letting Go\u201d (2008), the author puts Todd's distinctive voice as a narrator and his strong dialect, indicating his rural background and lack of education, opposite various dialects of other people on New World. Dialect is used in order to illustrate their settlement's differing levels of technological advancement and thus, to build conflict between the different settlements on New World, that will eventually erupt into a war in future books of the \u201cChaos Walking\u201d trilogy. ...more A lot of more recent books from the Young Adult/Dystopian genre seemingly tend to imitate the sweeping successes trilogies like The Hunger Games or Divergent were, featuring a likeable heroine, usually an attractive male protagonist, certain dystopian elements, some villains and an exciting plot. Don't be mistaken, a lot of those aspects you will discover in Patrick Ness' trilogy as well, but that's by far not everything this book has to present to its readers. Let me attempt to convince you of A lot of more recent books from the Young Adult/Dystopian genre seemingly tend to imitate the sweeping successes trilogies like The Hunger Games or Divergent were, featuring a likeable heroine, usually an attractive male protagonist, certain dystopian elements, some villains and an exciting plot. Don't be mistaken, a lot of those aspects you will discover in Patrick Ness' trilogy as well, but that's by far not everything this book has to present to its readers. Let me attempt to convince you of why you have to read this book. a) The characters are well-developed and qualified to root for, and let's not forget, we won't find a second pair like Peeta and Katniss or Tris and Four in this book. Instead, the protagonists are twelve-year-old Todd Hewitt (when do modern YA Fantasy/Sci-Fi/Dystopian novels ever feature a male point of view character?) and the bizarre Viola, a lost girl he discovers in the swamps surrounding the town he grew up in. During the course of the novel, Todd and Viola have to learn to rely on each other in order to survive, and it's their relationship which marks central parts of this novel. What's the best part of it? Patrick Ness doesn't include useless romantic aspects in the storyline, partly thanks to the characters' ages. I'm not against romance in novels, but I'm against using the same romantic devices in YA novels over and over again. Instead of love, Patrick Ness explored the motif of friendship , and he absolutely succeeded in doing so. b) The premise is original and interesting alike, establishing a world in which your thoughts are not exactly your own thoughts, because everyone else is able to hear your thoughts which surround your body in an everlasting presence following a virus which was released on human beings by an alien race. Imagine what that means: It is very hard to lie or conceal secrets, because in a lot of cases, the more you try not to think of certain things, the more you can't help but think about them, and if you think about them, others will know your thoughts. This can definitely be a good thing, but in a world such as this, where Todd and Viola have to escape their enemies and survive against creatures who want to harm them ... in such a world it isn't always that good. c) The adventure in this novel is so intriguing that, especially in the second part of the novel, it will rob you of the capability to put the book down again. I had a rather hard time getting into the story, but once it started to become more fluent and reminiscent of Ness' writing in the acclaimed A Monster Calls , I was hooked and couldn't take my eyes off the page anymore. Sometimes it is annoying to find out that each and every single chapter ends on a major cliffhanger, but the author managed to insert them into the story in such a believable way that I ended up not minding this at all. In addition, Todd's dog Manchee has to be the best dog ever . (Did I mention that animals are able to speak in this world? And they will bluntly say, independent from which situation they are in, when they have to poo.) And if you now forget about the least-developed villain of all time this novel unfortunately features with the more than crazy Aaron, then it could have been a 5-star-read. But that shall not discourage anyone from reading the book, because if you are interested in a crossover between the genres YA and Science Fiction with some surprising depth, then reading this book can be totally recommended.

A constant stream of sound and images feed us information, prod us toward rampant consumerism, and entertain us. I've become increasingly aware that many of my students seem uncomfortable with simple quiet--always wanting some sort of noise to help them concentrate and focus. It's sad that our world has become one in which quiet is such a rare and undervalued commodity. And that, according to Patrick Ness, is the inspiration for The Knife of Never Letting Go . Inventive and unlike anything I've ever read, The Knife of Never Letting Go is billed as a young adult dystopian but there's very little that's young adult about it other than a 13 year old protagonist. In fact, a lot of the language is violent, graphic, and brutal by young adult standards, but it has to be to capture the world that has been created by Ness. Todd Hewitt is only days away from becoming a man by Prentisstown standards. Prentisstown is a town on New World, a planet that is being \"settled\" by the people of earth. What's unusual about Prentisstown, though, is that it's a town that consists entirely of men. The women were killed twelve years earlier when the Spackle, the indigenous alien race, utilized germ warfare in an attempt to win the war against the pioneers. The men, however, were not entirely immune to this germ. Instead of killing them, it made every man's inner-thoughts (both verbal and visual) visible to those around him. There are no secrets in the Noise. As a means of coping, some men turn to drink, others attempt to run away, and some kill themselves. Life here is bleak under the totalitarian rule of Mayor Prentiss and the bizarre radical teachings of the holy man, Aaron. As far as Todd knows, Prentisstown is the only place on the planet. As Todd nears his 13th birthday, he finds something in the swamp that shouldn't exist--silence. Shortly after discovering this peculiarity and unable to find its source, he's forced to flee Prentisstown and go on the run with only his dog, a knapsack of supplies, a hunting knife, and a book written for him by his mother. To tell you the how and why for all of this would be to ruin the suspense that drives the entire novel. Todd struggles for survival and begins to unravel the lies that he's been told his entire life. During his journey, he discovers the truth about New World and about Prentisstown. The novel is told in first person stream of consciousness, which really works because it's like we as readers are able to \"hear\" Todd's Noise just as the other inhabitants of Prentisstown would. It also means that we learn as Todd learns and, as his mind shies away to avoid truths that he can't yet accept, information is sometimes withheld from us. In addition, some of the words are written in dialect to help better capture how Todd sounds. There are some unusual narrative techniques used throughout, such as a different font to indicate the Noise of different individuals and animals (that's right--even animals have Noise; I particularly enjoyed the depiction of Todd's dog Manchee) as Todd encounters them. Instead of finding them gimmicky, I thought it a very effective way of visually demonstrating the intrusion of other people's thoughts into one's own. In some ways, the novel reminded me of the television series Firefly , but only in that these space travelers are the new pioneers. While they have a lot of new technology, the struggle for survival is a very real one and never certain. The novel ends with one hell of a cliffhanger and I find myself for the first time in a long time wanting to dive right into the second novel of the series. Cross posted at This Insignificant Cinder ...more This is an excellent book. Not only is the concept unique, but the story itself is written so differently that I could not put it down. The author uses first person to tell the story of young Todd, capturing the diction and language of a adolecent, somewhat redneck boy perfectly with statements like: \"The plans are still being planned, the preparayshuns prepared, it will be a party, I guess, tho I'm starting to get some strange pictures about it, all dark and too bright at the same time, but nev This is an excellent book.

That's how it is in the book. The dog, Manchee, is easily my favorite part of the story, and sounds exactly like how you'd expect a dog to sound like. (\"Todd! Todd! Leaving, Todd? Todd! Can't leave, Todd!\" I finally smack him on the rump. \"Ow, Todd?\") Concerned about sheep and squirrels and poos, yet completely loyal to his boy. I imagine that's how my dog would sound, if he ever learned to talk, god help us. This is only book one of a series, and the ending leaves you going \"What? That's it? Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!\" So, I will have to wait until the second book comes out, but you can be sure I'm going to buy it to continue this facinating story of a world where nothing is hidden.

The Noise is a man unfiltered, and without a filter, a man is just chaos walking. Este es el libro que tenia mas tiempo en mi to-read-list , lo he querido leer desde antes de entrar a GR, mucho antes. Ahora no solo me arrepiento de haber tardado tanto, si no de no tener la continuaci\u00f3n conmigo. BOOKSMART ESTOY CONTANDO CONTIGO Y LA FIL DE MONTERREY, MALDITO! MAS TE VALE QUE LO TENGAS! *respirahondo* The knife of never letting go es un libro con truco. Por que? Pues por que le apuesta a que te acostumbres a muchas cosas. Cosas como el estilo de escritura que es representaci\u00f3n del analfabetismo de Todd, nuestro protagonista. O como la importancia religiosa retorcida para esa sociedad. O la importancia aun m\u00e1s exagerada de pasar de ni\u00f1o a hombre. O las diferentes represiones entre sexos por las diferencias que tienen, en este libro en particular, una diferencia dictada por el Ruido , que es un germen que hace que escuches los pensamientos de los dem\u00e1s a todas horas todo el d\u00eda. As\u00ed que, puede que le encuentres la l\u00f3gica, o puede que no. En lo personal, a mi me encanto la idea y como se desarrollo. Tiene mucha mas profundidad de la que cre\u00ed. Como punto negativo dir\u00eda que si tiene varias hojas de mas, no son malas exactamente pero tampoco necesarias. Y me hubiera gustado que al final no se hubiera sobredramatizado tanto una cosita (view spoiler) [ Todo lo de Pretiss Jr. Creo que no venia al caso, creo que eso del disparo a Viola fue drama de mas. (hide spoiler) ] Se tocan temas bastante delicados pero no se mencionan de forma directa siempre, el autor deja que te los imagines, lo cual puede llegar a ser mucho mas intenso. La inocencia es algo muy importante en el libro lo cual quiere decir que Todd estar\u00e1 sin respuestas por bastante tiempo, casi \u00be del libro y todos esos cap\u00edtulos aunque muy oscuros, informativos y aventurescos pueden llegar a ser bastante tediosos para algunos, en lo personal me fascinaron porque le agarre la onda a la escritura muy r\u00e1pido pero se requiere mucha paciencia. Asi que te recomiendo que lo leas cuando no est\u00e9s muy cargado de trabajo o escuela. Una lectura excelente para quienes les gusta pensar y procesar lo que leen. O para quienes les gustan los libros juveniles serios. No hay nada \u201cfresco\u201d ni \u201cligero\u201d en esta trama, esta bastante cargada de desesperaci\u00f3n, huida, enojo y tristeza, y no da respiro. Muy recomendado. Y mucho mas recomendado tener la continuaci\u00f3n a la mano. Tiene un final bastante abierto. War makes monsters of men ...more Initial Final Page Thoughts. OMFG.

I LOVE the writing style, it was annoying at first, but it really compliment the fast pace and the \u2018OMG\u2019 of the story. No romance! Blood and guts! Manchee! A true, terrifying baddie. A great spin on the dystopian genre. Friendship! Did I mention Manchee? Low Point. It took a while to find out what the eff (see what I did there? If not, just read the book, dammit!) was going on. BUT\u2026 it was good because Todd had no idea what was going on either so you found out together. Also, the style that Ness writes in is how Todd would write, ie not very well. It\u2019s a bit disorientating at first, especially when the Noise comes. But it all adds to the feel of this book. SO GOOD. I mentioned the cliffhanger\u2026 which was amazing\u2026 BUT COME ON, PATRICK NESS. I made myself a deal not to buy any more books until I\u2019ve read the ones I have got\u2026 and now my soul is tormented. What shall I do? Oh, who am I kidding? They\u2019re already in my postman\u2019s bag. Hero. Oh Todd Hewitt. TODD HEWITT!! I love you and, even though for some weird reason I keep trying to picture you older, you are such a great character. I would have loved to be your best friend when I was twelve. Heck, I would love to be your best friend NOW. I\u2019ve read a few reviews that have expressed annoyance with Todd, but I think they\u2019re forgetting that Todd is a lot younger than most people think he is. Which explains why he is angry and confused and self-doubting and a bit of loose cannon. Considering he is so young and has been through so much, it is understandable and that\u2019s why I love him. He\u2019s realistic and honest and just because he doesn\u2019t walk around with the whole \u2018I\u2019m special and therefore I am a martyr and must mope and be really annoying\u2019 and makes mistakes and loses his temper, doesn\u2019t make him a bad character. His reactions to the things he has to deal with are spot on for a twelve year old boy and they are the perfect combination of twelve year old boy indifference and \u2018Whaaaat the hell?\u2019 Also, he is a great great great friend. Sigh. Love Interest. N/A. Although, I have thoughts that this could change in the next books\u2026 *ahem* and I would be OK with it. I think. Best friend. Oooooh Manchee. Seriously, in the past couple of weeks I have found myself wanting a best friend who comes in the form of a talking animal. Remember Taggle? Yeah he was great and funny and all.. but Manchee. He takes the biscuit, and I love biscuits. The thing is, the germ that is making everyone\u2019s loud and clear and, well it also works on animals too. And as Todd says in the first page \u201c The first thing you find out when yer dog learns to talk is that dogs don\u2019t got nothing much to say. About anything. \u201d To which Manchee replies \u201cNeed a poo, Todd.\u201d That is where the magic of Manchee starts. And I will leave you with that\u2026 I will say only three things about t\u2019other best friend because I feel like I\u2019m already treading on spoilery egg shells\u2026 1) She\u2019s cute as a button. 2) She has a kickass backstory. 3) I can\u2019t wait to find out more about her. That is all. Baddie. This category is an interesting one because there are so many people who could technically be classed as a \u2018baddie\u2019 because of the situation they\u2019re in and the whole belief system. Again, I don\u2019t want to go into it for fear of spoiling it for you guys. But it is interesting, lot of debate could arise from some of the secondary characters who may at first seem evil, but all is not as it seems. However, one person is definitely a baddie\u2026. Oh my god. Aaron . Ugh... shudder. So so so creepy. Again, don\u2019t want to go too deep into my description, but I\u2019ll leave you with a little note that I wrote on my Kindle about him : \u201c What is he? The terminator?\u201d There\u2019s one chapter that\u2026 ugh, not going to think about that this close to going to bed. Theme Tune. Ordinary World by Duran Duran. I know when you think of Duran Duran you think of 80s GODS who provided the world with some gems as \u2018Wild Boys\u2019, \u2018Rio\u2019 and \u2018Girls on Film\u2019 and their music is probably as far as you can get from the tone of this book. But I think the lyrics to this are very apt for Todd and the journey he is on. And I know Red did a respectable cover which probably goes with the book more but I feel like I would have betrayed my undying love for Simon Le Bon if I had gone with that choice. And I simply refuse to do that. Angst scale. 9/10. Ness is gruesome. Seriously, his descriptions are vile and gross and amazing and creepy as hell. There is a lot of violence in this book which probably explains why this series did so well with boys (which is great, more YA aged boys should read!) and girls who, like me, were raised on Tarantino. YEAH. But, I think the most brutal aspect of this book was not the bloody violence but just the idea of everything. It\u2019s hard to describe what I mean without ruining the story and I don\u2019t want to do that, because this book is like a rollercoaster of twisting turns. But\u2026 let me just say this, the New World really is effed up and that\u2019s why this book gets such a high angst rating because this angst will stick with you long after you are left teetering on the edge of that blasted cliff! Recommended for. EVERYONE. But also BOYS who think reading is for simpering girls who like sparkly vampires and hate blood unless it\u2019s theirs and it\u2019s around the mouth of said sparkly vampires.

But apparently, I bought the book--for this reason: I want to feel what they felt when they read this. If they were disappointed at this book, I would also want too. And so does the other way. And I want to know their reasons. And here comes my time to judge . Patrick Ness made a heavy, strong character named Todd Hewitt. Since Ness used first person point of view, this has to be Todd\u2019s\u2014the main protagonist\u2014perspective. Ness created different firm characters in terms of consistency with their personalities. Furthermore, the story possesses deep substances that could unleash reader\u2019s different powerful emotions. You will laugh from the simple and natural lines that the characters have. You will hate, scream, loath, punch and throw a fire in wrath. You will cry as if you\u2019re broken-hearted, and hardly move-on. The author created a unique world wherein he could play the characters, places, time, etc. in a more realistic way. This book proves one thing: Magic isn\u2019t just the one that can create new amazing Haven. There are just questions that I need immediate answers: (view spoiler) [ What was the effing problem with Viola when they were still at Prentisstown? She didn\u2019t talk and I thought she was a mute. And right after they reached the next town, she was like as if said: Hello I\u2019m Viola and tadahhh! I\u2019m not mute and stop asking why I didn\u2019t talk. I don\u2019t know if it is right to ask this: Why the misspelled words of Todd wasn\u2019t Italicized? I was like one who was illiterate at first, thinking what the words mean.eg. stayshun, creacher. They have thirteen months, right? What month is next to December, then?

( sorry, that was terrible ) I guess I was thinking this would be more cerebral, but it turned out to be a fast-paced, action-filled read that reminded me a bit of The Hunger Games in that it follows a kid in survival mode in a dystopian world. Here's the story in a nutshell: A boy on the verge of becoming a man via his village's secretive initiation rites, flees the isolated community with an angry mob at his heels, trying to find out what the heck is going on along the way. Though this was a straight up adventure story heavy on Campbell's archetypal mythology, it did have it's thoughtful moments and ideas to ponder. For instance, men have the ability to hear in their heads what other men are thinking, thus they are tormented by what they call \"Noise,\" the mass of thoughts continuously bombarding them. Women don't give off noise, but can hear the noise of men. I don't know if this was intended, but I thought that was a nice parallel to real life, where generally speaking men's thoughts are not hard to deduce and women are a mystery to men, again, generally speaking. The narration is first person, so we are constantly in the mind of Todd Hewitt, a young, uneducated, angry, and often frustrated youth. Sticking with a stupid hick for 400+ pages can be trying on the nerves. But Ness' world creation is a good distraction, his plot is intriguing enough and he added in some levity in the form of a pet dog for Todd, so I managed to hang in there. As with most dystopian novels I've read, scenery description is sparse. Ness' desire to keep the ball rolling and only slow it down for a bit of exposition now and then, means that he didn't spend much time with the setting. That's fine, and even preferable for action's sake, but it can leave one feeling empty and colorblind for want of scenery. ...more \u201cHow do you think you could have possibly come this far if you didn\u2019t have hope?\u201d I jumped into The Knife of Never Letting Go knowing just two things\u2014Jo recommended it and Patrick Ness wrote it.

But there will be time for gushing later. For now\u2026 Let me introduce you to Prentisstown. A town settled by space colonists trying to find a new world all their own, but what they found instead was a land inhabited by aliens and noise! Every one, even the animals, can hear each other\u2019s thoughts (yes, every thought). They call it Noise. \u201cMen\u2019s minds are messy places and Noise is like the active, breathing face of that mess. It\u2019s what\u2019s true and what\u2019s believed and what\u2019s imagined and what\u2019s fantasized and it says one thing and a completely opposite thing at the same time and even tho the truth is definitely in there, how can you tell what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not when yer getting everything?\u201d This is a town with ugly Noise, where boys become men at the age of 13 and oh, yeah\u2014there are no women left. A dying town with dark, dark secrets. Todd Hewitt will learn these secrets on his thirteenth birthday just one month away. But all that and everything else changes when he meets Viola and her silence. Silence and a girl! Well, let\u2019s just say the evil powers that be in Prentisstown feel a bit threatened, so Todd, Viola, and Manchee\u2014Todd\u2019s loyal dog and best friend--set off on a journey to keep each other safe and to warn others of danger. Through a landscape filled with valleys, rivers, woods, dust, and swamps chock full of dangers and bad guys, the trio find themselves in a race for the truth and a fight to survive. Readers and Todd are in the dark for much of the book. The questions pile up along with the action, but the search for the truth and answers to: why there are no women in Prentisstown, why men can\u2019t hear women\u2019s Noise, why the bad guys want Todd so badly and what the hell is going on will drive you nuts until the end! :D OH, the big bad guys in this book just...well they are the best kind. The big, bad religious kind on a mission who keeps on coming no matter what because they are meant to--it is their destiny! :D Love it! Aaron, Mr. Prentiss, Jr. and Mayor Prentiss all wear, own, and strut their bad guy roles with style and flair. Pure scary, creepy fun! But let\u2019s get back to the man of the hour and my gushing\u2026 Patrick Ness. I warned you there would be more gushing! ;) The man deserves so much more than what I can say here, but let me give it a go. The man has skills! Skills! He crafted a tale with such suspense that I found myself gripping the book so tightly that my fingernails left claw marks! A tale where strangers forge such a strong bond and friendship that I could feel it in my own heart. I literally thought my heart was going to burst at one point when Todd hugged\u2026well I can\u2019t go there! \u2026.Let\u2019s just say, Ness made me long and miss characters that were barely in the action. But one of my favorite Ness skills is how he includes the reader in the story. I felt as if I was part of the adventure! He literally pulls the readers in (shut up)\u2014he does! These characters and Mr. Ness spoke right to my heart and soul! Alright, alright\u2014I will reel in the fangirl love and gushing. Let me just say that this book has become one of my favorites that I plan to return to again and again! This story made me proud, cry, smile, laugh, and even crush a bit. (view spoiler) [Ben! Come on! The man hummed, hugged, and said \u201cnifty\u201d. :) (hide spoiler) ] Todd, Viola, Manchee, Ben, Cillian, and the whole cast of characters made me examine how well I really know someone, made me see how a right decision can be so wrong at the same time, and pushed me to look at my decisions in life.

This led to me buying almost everything he has ever written and reading them all back to back, without even pausing to write a review in-between. So, let me begin this review by apologizing to my GR friends for the onslaught of Ness-related reviews coming your way today! Sorry (not so So for the entire month of February I have been Patrick Ness crazy! Like, CRAZY!! I had never read any Ness before so I thought I'd pick up one or two of his books as I had heard only good things about his writing. This led to me buying almost everything he has ever written and reading them all back to back, without even pausing to write a review in-between. So, let me begin this review by apologizing to my GR friends for the onslaught of Ness-related reviews coming your way today! Sorry (not sorry). The Knife of Never Letting Go is the first installment of The Chaos Walking Trilogy. The book opens in Prentisstown, a fictional town in a fictional world. The occupants of this town are predominately farmers, entirely male and, oh, they can all hear each other's every thought. The reader is immediately introduced, in the form of first person narration, to the first protagonist, who remains with us for all three of the books, Todd. Now I initially found Todd an unlikable main character: he appears moody, quarrelsome and quick-tempered, but it was something I could abide with, as I was foreseeing a personal transformation as the book progressed. It transpires that events in Todd's short life gave him every right to act as the petulant child that he is. It is the honest, considerate man he quickly becomes who gained my heart, though. Now I know that many people find untrustworthy and initially unrelatable characters a bit of a faux pas, but this only shows that Ness is not afraid to transgress the boundaries of what is deemed 'acceptable' in writing. And he doesn't stop there. This book is a series of shock after shock as Ness continually takes you to the limits of your expectations and then transgresses them. This book features continual cliffhangers and false hope as Ness lays the foundations for the climax for the novel. Or should I say climaxes, plural. This book is synonymous with choppy waters: you crested a wave not knowing if you'd find calm waters or rapids beyond it. And one such climacteric moment was the introduction of our second protagonist, Viola. The chance meeting between Todd and herself altered the course of the story and aligned two separate stories as one. The first-person style of narration highlighted that the inner-thoughts of the protagonist weren't always what was revealed in his Noise (or, thoughts). Noise is a precarious thing, only revealing a portion of the man beneath the outward portrayal of his thoughts. This, combined with Ness' beautiful writing gave a rich, dense narrative that stunned, staggered and surprised me. I have honestly never read something so richly-coated with action and substance in such equal measures. This book, and this series, is like no other! ...more I've never heard of Patrick Ness or \"Chaos Walking\" trilogy before. Luckily for me, \"The Knife of Letting Go\" was a November pick of one of my YA book groups. \"The Knife of Never Letting Go\" is one of those \"boy\" books - there is a lot of action, there is a chase, a lot of mystery and very little sappy romance. The dystopian/sci-fi setting is exciting - an alien planet where people can hear each others thoughts. The protagonist - Todd - is a 12-year old boy on the brink of manhood in a town wher I've never heard of Patrick Ness or \"Chaos Walking\" trilogy before.

The dystopian/sci-fi setting is exciting - an alien planet where people can hear each others thoughts. The protagonist - Todd - is a 12-year old boy on the brink of manhood in a town where are no women. One day Todd comes across something during his trip through a swamp that sets in motion a chain of events that makes Todd run for his life as fast as he can. This book is a fascinating journey to slowly uncover the secrets of Prentisstown. It is fast paced, it's never dull, just as you fell the action is slowing down, something shocking happens again, another mystery is uncovered, and you keep following the story on the edge of your seat. While I enjoyed the book immensely, there are some flaws. I think the main one is that the climax of the story, when most of the secrets are uncovered, comes a little too late. By the time you find out the reasons for Todd's chase, you already have kind of figured it all out on your own. Another thing, the book ends with a huge cliffhanger. Although most of the questions raised in the book are answered, it ends with another set of questions. It's a perfect set up for us, readers, to crave to read the second book right away, but it is disheartening at the same time. I know I am ready to read second installment. I suspect the second book ends with a cliffhanger too and the third doesn't come out until next September... P.S. Dog lovers, beware, have some Kleenex ready.
