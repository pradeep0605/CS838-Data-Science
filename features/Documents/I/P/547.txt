A VISION CAME TO ME TWO MOONS AGO, WHEN I WAS GAZING DEEP INTO HIS MAJESTY\u2019S OWN PHLEGM POT. I WAS HEATING THE POT OVER A FLAME WHEN THE SIGN APPEARED. THIS VISION WAS MORE VIVID AND DETAILED THAN ANY I HAD PREVIOUSLY SEEN. BECAUSE OF ITS IMPORTANCE, I DECIDED TO WRITE IT DOWN FOR POSTERITY. AND SO I CAN SAY I TOLD YOU SO. I SAW AN AGE WHEN THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DRIVEN UNDERGROUND BY THE MUD MEN. THIS IS WHAT THE PHLEGM TOLD ME: IN THIS TIME, ONE SHALL COME AMONG US. FOWL BY NAME AND FOUL BY NATURE.<---F> A MUD MAN UNLIKE ANY OTHER</---F>. HE SHALL LEARN OUR SECRETS AND USE THEM AGAINST US. I SEE HIM NOW AS PLAIN AS DAY. HIS FACE IS PALE, HE HAS DARK EYES AND RAVEN HAIR. YET IT MUST BE A MISTAKE FOR HE SEEMS A MERE YOUTH. SURELY NO MUD BOY COULD OUTWIT THE PEOPLE. BUT NOW I SEE THAT THE BOY IS NOT ALONE. HE IS AIDED BY A FORMIDABLE WARRIOR SCARRED FROM A THOUSAND BATTLES. THIS FOWL SHALL HOLD THE PEOPLE TO RANSOM FOR THEIR MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSION. GOLD. AND IN SPITE OF ALL OUR MAGIC, THERE IS A CHANCE THAT HE WILL PREVAIL. FOR HE HAS DISCOVERED HOW TO ESCAPE THE TIME FIELD, UNFORTUNATELY, HOW THE STORY ENDS I CANNOT SAY. BUT THERE WAS MORE TO SEE.

Summary: Artemis Fowl is a child genius/billionaire/criminal mastermind who has discovered that fairies (and the like) are real and is seeking to exploit them. He does this by kidnapping a LEPrecon (for Lower Elements Police Reconnaissance). The Lower Elements live underground, having been driven there by the Mud People (or humans). I decided that the book was not good in the first few pages. The writing is not up to par. Some of the dialogue seems like it came from two six-year-olds arguing about whose laser gun was better, when in fact all they have are cheap squirt guns. A child\u2019s imagination is an amazing thing, but the words they use to describe their imagination is quite another. In addition to the bad writing and dialogue, the plot is also poorly structured. But what makes me really angry about this book is the attempt to brainwash kids through literature. I am not opposed to teaching children morals and values through stories, in fact that is the way it has been done for centuries, but this book goes above and beyond what is acceptable. The author, <---A>Eoin Colfer</---A>, is trying to teach children to take care of the environment by contrasting fairy society with human society. However, in attempting this, he shows his repulsion of not just pollution but of the whole human race. Keep in mind that Mud People is the Fairy term for human being, which seems to be slur in and of itself. Let me share some passages with you: If the Mud People knew [about leprechauns] they\u2019d probably take steps to stamp them out. Pg. 33 Mud People bred like rodents. Pg. 50 The Mud People destroyed everything they came in contact with. Pg. 50 The only good thing about going to the toilet was the minerals being returned to the earth, but the Mud People had even managed to botch that up by treating the \u2026stuff\u2026with bottles of blue chemicals. Pg. 50 She could see the pollution in [the dolphins], bleaching their skin white and giving them red sores on their backs. And although she smiled, her heart was breaking. Mud People had a lot to answer for. Pg. 68 The smell of death and pain lingered in the blood-swabbed decks. Many noble creatures had died here, died and been dissected for a few bars of soap and some heating oil. Humans were such barbarians. Pg. 105 The Mud People had greased the hinges [of the whaling boat] with whale blubber. Was there no end to their depravity. Pg. 106 Mud People have been stealing from us for millennia. Why do you think we live underground? Pg. 120 \u2026unless the Mud People had learned to coexist with other species. And if history had taught any lessons it was that humans couldn\u2019t get along with anyone, even themselves. Pg. 125 \u201c\u2026I\u2019d say there was some human blood in you.\u201d In describing a fairy who was a little trigger happy. Then later, he apologized because, \"it had been a deeply offensive insult.\" Pg. 128 No one built weapons of cruelty like the Mud Men. Pg. 265 Sorry, there were quite a few. It just makes me angry to see someone be this repulsed by their own species. I recognize that the types of humans described in the above passages do in fact exist, but not all humans are like that, and we are getting better. But you know what I would like to do now, I would like to debate Mr. Colfer\u2019s accusations on humanity using the fairy world he created for her book. First of all, let me share with you the basic history of human-fairy relations, according to Colfer. Fairies apparently descended from Pterodactyls, and lived peacefully on earth for many millennia until the humans evolved. The fairies called these humans, Mud People, because they lived in the mud. The humans apparently could not help but try and kill the fairies. Instead of fighting, the fairies withdrew underground, and it is there that they have lived for many centuries. Going deeper and deeper as we humans mine more and more. The fairies only return to the surface to replenish their magic. Now, answer me this, if you care about something, would you fight for it or would you hide? I would fight for it, and it seems that the fairies would too. That is the basis for the plot of the book, but for some reason, the fairy race has decided too hide, while these cruel humans destroy the earth that they care about so much. But who even says that we would have to fight. All we know is that they are not fighting. So, we can\u2019t change that. These fairies complain about our destruction and pollution of earth. However, the main fairy in the book at one point uses wings (they strap on to their backs) that are gasoline powered. Now granted, they were an old pair of wings, now all the newer wings are solar powered, but the fact that they had at one point used gasoline, and are still using gasoline in older modeled wings, seems to indicate that they are partially responsible for the pollution on earth, and only switched to solar recently. The main fairy also complains about the human's sewage treatment. I would also like to know what the fairies would propose that we do with our sewage besides treating it. We create so much that the earth cannot biodegrade it quickly enough to keep disease from breeding in it. Now, if we had the magic power to heal, like the fairies, then maybe we could just let it return to earth naturally, but the fairies have taken the magic away from us. They will not share. And one more thing, the author says that no one builds weapons of cruelty like the humans, yet, throughout the book, Colfer describes fairy weapons like a \u201cNeutrino 2000\u201d which is a platinum nuclear handgun that has three settings, \u201cscorched, well-done, and crisped to a cinder\u201d, and not only that but the gun will continue to work for well over a thousand years, so not only can you use it to kill many things, but should you die or lose it, it will continue to work in the hands of others for a millenium. But the worst weapon the fairies have invented is a \u201cBlue Rinse\u201d, which is a biological bomb that destroys only living tissue, leaving the landscape unchanged. Can you imagine? All the \u201cbenefits\u201d of Hiroshima, without all the bad side effects like destroying a city. And what\u2019s worse is that while we have used the nuclear bomb only twice, the fairies use the blue rinse \u201con rare occasions.\u201d That sounds a lot more frequent than twice. I don\u2019t know about you, but it sounds like the fairies are just as capable as humans in the production of weapons of cruelty. But you know what, that argument is stupid. There are no fairies with magic powers, despite the numerous books available that would suggest otherwise, and if they do exist, they have decided not to help us. So, it is up to us humans to work things out on our own, and while there have been some bad things in our past, what matters now is our present, and what we do from here on out, and I would like to say that in spite of it all, we are doing a pretty good job. Humans are good creatures, created in the image of God. We are imperfect, but on the whole, we are all striving for perfection every day. And that is all I have to say about that. ...more Want to meet the guy who's smart enough to take over the world? Well he's twelve years old. And his name is Artemis Fowl.

At the age of 12, Artemis is keeping his family afloat as they suffer from grief at the disappearance of Artemis Fowl, Sr, his father. His mother has retreated into delusions and barely leaves her room. The family is on the brink of bankruptcy, but not for long, if Artemis has anything to do with it. Assisted by his faithful bodyguard, a very large, deadly, intimidating man would do anything for him, Artemis decides to steal his very own fairy to hold for ransom: his very own pot of gold. He doesn't realize that Holly is just as dangerous as he is. When LEPrecon (Lower Elements Police reconnaisance), the covert Fairy organization policing the faery creatures that have retreated underground to get away from humans, comes looking for Holly, he has to fight off a siege on his house of supernatural creatures such as a troll (don't want to be in their way), a dwarf with flatulence from ingesting rocks and soil when he burrows his way through the earth, and a centaur genius who is LEPrecon's equivalent to MI6's Q, and a whole slew of highly-trained deadly fairies. I picked this book up on a lark, looking for something different to read. And boy was I rewarded. This book will make you laugh and keep you enthralled for hours. Although this is perfectly suitable for a young teen or a pre-teen, it's also sophisticated for an adult to enjoy, and a must read for lovers of Faery. ...more Colfer has described this series as \u201cDie Hard, with fairies\u201d, which is a reference to an old Hollywood joke . After the phenomenal success of that movie, a lot of writers started pitching their scripts as \u2018Die Hard, with [blank]\u201d, such as Speed: \u201cDie Hard on a Bus\u201d, or Air Force One: \u201cDie Hard, on Air Force One\u201d, or, as the joke goes, the unfortunate who wanted to make \"Die Hard, in a building\". If you have actually seen Die Hard, you might recall Hans Gruber, the wealthy, cunning, erudite, Europe Colfer has described this series as \u201cDie Hard, with fairies\u201d, which is a reference to an old Hollywood joke . After the phenomenal success of that movie, a lot of writers started pitching their scripts as \u2018Die Hard, with [blank]\u201d, such as Speed: \u201cDie Hard on a Bus\u201d, or Air Force One: \u201cDie Hard, on Air Force One\u201d, or, as the joke goes, the unfortunate who wanted to make \"Die Hard, in a building\". If you have actually seen Die Hard, you might recall Hans Gruber, the wealthy, cunning, erudite, European villain (played by Alan \u2018Not-Just-Snape\u2019 Rickman). But in this book, the European criminal is the main character, suggesting Colfer views the movie in the same light as Barney Stinson of How I Met Your Mother : \u201dHans Gruber. Charming international bandit. In the end, he dies hard. He's the title character.\u201d So, already, we have some interesting choices going on, but many\u2019s the good idea buried by poor execution. In some ways, telling a good story is like telling an effective lie: you have to know your limits. Like the old writer's adage from Faulker: you've got to kill your darlings. Those overly clever ideas and indulgences have to go, if they don't fit, which they usually don't. If an author gives in to the urge over-explain or get too fancy, he's going to trip himself up, and Colfer often does. He throws around a lot of terminology, trying to seem knowledgeable to lend credibility to his little fantasy story, but he usually gets it wrong. He talks about an impact hitting with \u2018a ton of G force\u2019, which is nonsense. \u2018G Force\u2019 already has a built-in unit of measurement, which is 'Gs', not mass. The process of acceleration can be described in mass, but it would have to be compared to the acceleration of gravity on Earth, or 'Gs', which Colfer fails to do. It would be like describing the speed of a car as \u2018fourteen feet'. He also describes a character as rocketing down a hallway at Mach 1, which is the speed of sound (768 mph). Moving at this speed for a tenth of a second\u2014the amount of time it takes for our brain to react enough to blink\u2014a person would travel 112\u2019, more than the length of the hallway described. Yet he still has his character looking back, adjusting his visor, and fretting about whether he will make it through the door. Not to mention that someone accelerating to Mach 1 within the length of such a hallway would squash them like a bug (at 350 Gs). He also describes a seasoned bodyguard who refers to the spin kick as pointless and flashy. While jumping spinning kicks may fall into this category, a simple spinning back kick is both an effective and basic tool for a martial artist, and one which is often used in competition in many full-contact disciplines. Early in the book, he goes to great lengths to describe the computer translation of an unknown language. The entire process is extremely simplified, which is fine, but then, when the translation comes out, not only is it grammatically perfect, it\u2019s all in rhyming couplets! I always feel frustrated by authors who see the 'Young Adult' label as an excuse to write a thoughtless, cliche book full of simple mistakes. I don't think giving kids badly-researched misinformation is going to turn them into better readers. And these are all details that could have been easily glossed over. Anyone who knew what the terms meant would have seen they were wrong, and anyone who didn't know them would find them meaningless. One of the benefits of writing Science Fiction or Fantasy is not having to explain yourself , not having to be an expert in everything you talk about. You can just wave your hand and give some mumbo-jumbo and that\u2019s fine, we can suspend our disbelief as long as your story's good. Which is why, when an author writing a fantastical story tries to inject realism, it's important for them to know what they are talking about, otherwise, they\u2019ll just make themselves look foolish for no good reason. Instead of leaving well enough alone, Colfer tried to come off as well-informed and technical, and failed miserably. A good author doesn\u2019t telegraph their ineptitude, they hide it--but that means a good author must be aware of their limits. He also goes on a rather condescending diatribe about how Ireland is the most magical place, and Irish mythology is superior to all other myths, because Ireland is the birthplace of all magic. Not only is this a rather insensitive view, it\u2019s also short-sighted, since the book is full of myths which have their basis not in Ireland, but in Scandinavia (dwarves, elves, and trolls). The original people of Ireland were short and dark-haired, with their own complex mythologies. All the redheads of Ireland are descendants of Scandinavian invaders, who brought their myths with them. But even after this bit of out-of-place nationalism, Colfer never actually ends up using any Irish myth in the story. It\u2019s all very generic stuff. Except for a few place-names, there is nothing uniquely Irish here. His depictions of fairy creatures do not demonstrate any Gaelic origin--indeed, the only thing mythic about them are their names and pointed ears. I\u2019m not saying Colfer should be tied to old traditions, or that he shouldn\u2019t create his own versions of myth, but it hardly makes sense for him to go on and on about the greatness of Irish magic if he's not going to bother actually using any of it. The statement is also incongruous with the fact that his protagonist is named after a character of Greek myth--and a female one, at that, but my annoyance with the misappropriation of the name \u2018Artemis\u2019 is my own onus to bear. There\u2019s also some eco propaganda, mainly in the form of attacking human beings for ruining everything, which once again, is condescending, over-simplified, and adds nothing to the book. The characters are unremarkable, just clich\u00e9s taken from buddy cop movies and played straight: no surprising depth, no twists, no masterful strokes of characterization, just what you\u2019d expect from a techno-spy thriller. Which is somewhat unusual, since this is nominally a fantastical book, but the fantasy elements are rarely touched upon. Mostly, the fairies operate with military commando squads and superior technology. There is nothing particularly magical about them. When magic is used, it tends to be either to be a simple solution to patch over plot conflicts, or a macguffin to cause conflicts in the first place. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, using a magic as a systematic problem-solver tends to make it feel a lot less magical and a lot more like an author\u2019s crutch. This is especially apparent when the magic is portrayed aside equally fantastical technologies that serve roughly the same purpose. If an author is going to use a lot of convenient bits of magic and technology so they don't have to think much about the plot, I\u2019m going to expect them to provide some sparkling, unusual characters. If they act stupidly or out-of-character in order to move the plot move along conveniently, then that plot should at least be exciting and unpredictable. Colfer's plot is standard. We do get the villain\u2019s point-of-view more often than in many stories, but that just reminds us how Fowl has little more depth than a James Bond villain. And if I get convenient plot-solving, clich\u00e9 characters, and a standard story, I need something else to make it worth reading. I had heard that, in this book, the special element was supposed to be humor, but I did not find this book humorous in any way. I\u2019m not saying that it tried to be funny and failed, I\u2019m not saying it was full of bad jokes which I rolled my eyes at. This book did not even attempt to be funny. There was no clever observation, and nothing surprising. Without the ability to surprise you, no author will be able to deliver any humor. There is a quite long series of repeated descriptions of a dwarf pooping rock explosively, but this was not presented in a humorous or surprising way, it was rather matter-of-fact, but not wry enough to qualify as \u2018deadpan\u2019. The entire book is suffused with a tone of irreverence, but the tone never achieves anything. There are no moments of punctuation where the irreverence boils over, it is just a constant, even presence in every scene, description, and bit of dialogue. It rather reminds me of a common problem of fan-fic authors: instead of being funny, or exciting, or having interesting characters, or surprising plot-twists, they will instead imply that they are doing those things through character reactions and overstated narration. Colfer constantly implies that eventually, he will just pop out and\u2014Bam! Be funny!\u2014but luckily, it proves to be an empty threat. The problem is, if you spend all your time promising to be funny or exciting, it just makes it more clear that you aren't actually delivering on that promise. It was easy to see what Colfer wanted this book to be (or more delusionally, thought it was), but it was also to see how often and predictably it failed. The cover is also ugly and cheap, and I came across some errors in the text, but I won\u2019t blame those on the author. All in all a straightforward, cliche little story. It's a fast read and not insultingly bad, just poorly-structured, predictable, and forgettable. There are some promising concepts there, but they all end up buried under pointless asides, misused jargon, and the constant promises of an interesting story that never arrives. * * * And as I wrote this review, I discovered something disturbing: Colfer has been hired to continue the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide series. I find this terribly confusing: Douglas Adams was one of the most insightful, clever, unpredictable, philosophically sound, satirically acerbic, and all-around-nice-guy writers that I have ever read. Yet here is Colfer: in no regard funny, with no insights to give, characters unremarkable, dialogue predictable, plot convenient, philosophical outlook insulting, unable to capitalize on an interesting concept, and enough of a self-absorbed jerk that he ruins even simple stories by trying to impress people with references to things he knows nothing about. Mr. Gaiman, I know you are a Goodreads author, and one of Adams\u2019 fondest fans, so I must ask you: how could you let this happen to me? If there is anyone who should be continuing Adam\u2019s series, it\u2019s Stewart Lee \u2014and if there were any two people who should continue it, it\u2019s two Stewart Lees. But you are also a great and talented author, and surprisingly enough, capable of being tremendously funny. No one appreciates more than I do the subtle and shocking wit of not writing a very funny book until six novels in, but I love the swerve of building up a career as a serious-minded, somewhat disturbing author of heavily-allusive horror and then suddenly kicking out something really funny . But I\u2019m losing my train of thought. Dear Mr. Gaiman, this year for Christmas, please use your magical authorial powers to remove Mr. Colfer from any relation to Mr. Adams\u2019 lovely work. If he wants to write his own dull crime fiction with some fairies thrown in to snag people who are waiting for better fantasy books to be published, that\u2019s his business, but the thought that someone would allow him to besmirch one of the great sci fi series of all time makes me want to snatch him up\u2014along with L. Sprague deCamp and August Derleth\u2014and make them all live in a world like the ones they created: a world which is a pale shadow of what it should be, where every conversation is stilted, every person dull, every jest flaccid\u2014where fire is merely lukewarm, spattered blood pepto-pink, sunsets an overwrought cacophony by Thomas Kincaid, where food is ash in your mouth, where every story starts in a 'white room' , and where loving a beautiful woman just feels like clutching your own calloused hand in the dark as you play out the long-faded fantasies of a false-nostalgic youth.

In the natural (or \"typical\") way of things, that would mean the antagonists are good guys, who we're hoping won't succeed, at least not 100%. I haven't tired of this formula just yet, plus Colfer has handled it well and crafted a fast, short read that doesn't give you much downtime to reflect on any potential faults. I found this book to be very similar to Jonathan Stroud's The Amulet of Samarkand with its snarky protagonist, its magic-in-a-modern-setting, its fantastical creatures and its infusion of light-hearted comedy (Things slowing down due to necessary exposition? Throw in a fart joke!). You can tell Colfer did a bit of research into mythology and magical beings, as we see some creature attributes from the old traditions. For instance, I like his portrayal of a burrowing dwarf. He also had fun with meshing the modern aspects with these old notions, technology with mythology. I've not always been a big fan of that genre (parts of the Ralph Bakshi movie \"Wizards\" annoyed me the first time I saw it), but Colfer balances and blends the two together pretty well, almost seamlessly. Rating Note: This was such a strong 4 that I decided to go with 5 stars. ...more Artemis Fowl (Artemis Fowl, #1) \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0622\u0631\u062a\u0645\u06cc\u0633 \u0641\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0648 \u06af\u0631\u0648\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u06af\u06cc\u0631\u06cc -

For example, the dwarf character defeats his enemies with the help of his terribly powerful flatulence more than once. The whole race tunnels with the power of poop. The main faerie character, Holly, is a girl trying to break her way through a glass ceiling that no one seems to notice throughout the book except to note that she has broken it. The main character, although a bit shallowly described is likable and fun. However, he would be much more believable if the author had chosen to make him just a few years older. All of these come from the author's unnecessarily pandering to the children who will presumably comprise the majority of his audience. In addition, there is a pretty large amount of environmentalist agenda in this rather short book. I have no problem with saving the whales, but the many asides concerning pollution and extinction seemed completely out of place. In addition, although it sounds insane to ask for a rational and coherent system behind a hidden race of faeries, I believe this is one of the lines that separates good fantasy from run-of-the-mill fantasy. This is a test Colfer fails. His system of magic and faeries is incoherent and sometimes seems inconsistent. At the very least it is ill-explained. Despite all of these shortcomings, the world is very imaginative, and the story is fun. The characters are all likable for the most part, if often shallow. Colfer's storytelling method adds enjoyment to the book in that you can enjoy the small victories of both sides of the conflict. Overall I would recommend this book only to those looking for light, fun, but overall forgettable fantasy. ...more First and foremost, let it be said that I am reading a book intended for someone half my age.

Artemis Fowl is the kind of book that grabs a kid by the eyeballs because of the pretty, shiny cover. But once the cover's open and the story laid out, Artemis Fowl is an incredibly gripping story about growing up, equality and acceptance. This was exactly the case when I first read Artemis Fowl; I immediately loved the intelligent, resourceful, but ultimately unhappy Artemis. A better character a teenager could not have asked for: Smart enough to forgo schooling for months at a time, rich beyond my (then considerable, now perhaps less so) imagination, and he was searching for a world of magic and fairies that every kid wants to believe in. It surprises me that even now, a decade later, the book still absorbs my imagination. \"Artemis Fowl\" taught me a little about writing for your audience exactly because the book is just as enjoyable and relatable as it was before. It's important to write with an audience in mind; Colfer here writes for children, and the child in me recognizes it. The spark of imagination that wants to believe in fairies and gnomes and magic rejoices. If only you could make all writing this lovable, simply by writing for an audience instead of to it. Oh, wait.

Unfortunately most of the adult books were colossal monsters that there was no way I was going to read in a week. So instead I decided to see what modern kids books were like and picked up Artemis Fowl, a book aimed at boys of about 11 years of age. The character of Artemis is 12, and a crime lord. Helped by his trusty bodyguard Butler he has discovered that fairies are real, and also really do have a pot of gold that he can steal. The main problem is that they live miles underground, and are more technologically advanced than humans. So he has to hatch a plan to trick them and kidnap a fairy to get the gold. Artemis has the devious criminal mind of Moriarty (Sherlock Holmes\u2019s adversary), and none of the lack of self confidence or lack of experience of a normal 12 year old. He can think he way around anything, and his bodyguard can do anything. All in all, a perfect bit of escapism for the adolescent male reader. However reading it as an adult you tend to start rooting for the fairy he is trying to kidnap, as Artemis really is a little a***hole. This is perhaps deliberate on the part of the author but I am not sure. There is not really enough meat on the plot either; it is difficult to remember that far back but I am sure that when I was the right age for this book I would have wanted a bit more detail about the hows, whys and wherefores to his great plan. Mind you my favourite books at this age were probably Enid Blyton or The Hardy Boys so I probably wouldn\u2019t have been the right audience anyway. :-) The most successful books of this kind tend to have a tightly-knit group of child characters who are friends and become closer as their adventure continues. Us against the world and all that. In contrast this book has a character that really has no friends and so no chance as a reader to see his true personality. OK it seems ironically childish that an adult finds a children\u2019s book disappointing, but as it has won numerous awards I had hoped for better. ...more To be honest I haven't read the whole book, and there is a slim chance that I might try to continue and so I post this review. The problem is that the onslaught of cheap jabs at the \"barbarian humans\" destroying the earth is becoming extremely irritating. And miraculously Ireland is still nice and green, but give those humans a few hundred years and it will be destroyed. Please. It completely distracts from the story. Why do we have to spoon feed children dogmatic propaganda? Don't get me wrong.

I can't even remember how many times I have read it but by now this book feels like an old friend and it's just as amazing as when I read it the first time. Now that I've re-read it once again, I think it's time for a review! When Holly Short gets abducted by <---C>Artemis Fowl II</---C>, a child prodigy from Ireland because he wants to ransom her for fairy gold, the book really gets going. The fairies are amazed by everything that Artemis knows about the People but they're definitely not giving up on Holly and are determined to rescue her and keep the gold in the meantime. But it seems that Artemis is always two steps ahead of them... Artemis sort of is an antagonist. He's no hero, and as is stated in the book: you can't romanticize him. This is absolutely true. And yet, I can't help but root for him. But on the other hand I also end up rooting for the fairies, especially Holly. Because she's so badass. You kind of just want both Artemis and Holly to win, whatever they're fighting for. Artemis definitely is a one of a kind character. I have never read about any character like him. He's twelve years old and a prodigy. No matter how many times I read this book, I'm always blown away by his genius (of should I say Eoin Colfer's genius?). In any case, he's probably my favorite fictional character ever created and I'm pretty sure it will never ever change. Holly is also one of my favorite characters. I love everything she stands for and even though there aren't that many female characters in his books, when there is, you can bet she'll end up having a very strong personality and being able to kick butt. So, yeah... that's Holly. She may be small but she can kick anyone's ass and is the first female on the LEPrecon squad + she has a feisty and reckless personality. Gotta love her! Personally, I think that this book has the greatest set of characters ever. Artemis and Holly aside, we also have Butler, Juliet, Commander Root and Foaly. I just love Butler. He always has Artemis's back and to me, he feels more like a father to Artemis than anything else. Juliet is Butlers teenage sister and she's a riot! Commander Root is simply epic. You definitely don't want to get on his bad side and Foaly is just brilliance itself. He's a centaur, a bit crazy and I love his wit! So do I have to say more? Artemis Fowl is a brilliant book. That's the way it just is. Eoin Colfer writes fast-paced, witty and sometimes even touching scenes. Is it any wonder he's my favorite author ever? ...more Reviewed by Me for TeensReadToo.com I've been trying to find a new series to hold me over until the next Harry Potter book--and I've finally found it.

Meet Artemis Fowl the Second, a twelve-year old genius who doesn't want to go to school, is worried about his mother's fragile mental health, is preoccupied with his father coming back from the dead, and who is determined to add to his family's coffers by any means possible. In a word, Artemis is an evil genius, and you just can't help but love him. Or hate him. Or love to hate him. Or hate to love him. Or...well, you get the picture. Artemis, along with his bodyguard/manservant/butler ironically named, of all things, Butler, Artemis sets out on his greatest, and most ambitious, scheme to date--discover the secrets of the fairy world, and relieve some of said fairies of their precious gold. After all, they have plenty to spare, and after Artemis Fowl the First lost a vast majority of their fortune, the Fowl family needs to pad the coffers. So off Artemis sets on a world jaunt to discover the secrets of the fairies, and his ambitions and delusions finally pay off--he meets an alcoholic sprite who, in exchange for the return of her magic, lets Artemis get a good look at her Book. The Book, you see, contains all the mandates, rules, and regulations (along with a slew of secrets) of the fairy world--and now Artemis Fowl is able to hatch his nefarious scheme. Artemis discovers that the fairies must adhere to very specific rituals to renew their powers, so along with Butler, he sets out on a stakeout to catch himself a fairy. Hoping, of course, that he can hold said fairy for ransom in exchange for some gold. What Artemis didn't include in his calculations, however, was Captain Holly Short. A member of the LEPrecon Unit, Holly, although a small sprite, is very human looking--and can be extrememely wily and dangerous. As Artemis implements his evil plan, Holly uses her own military-type background to hatch her own plan of escape. The results are both disastrous and hilarious. I read ARTEMIS FOWL in one sitting. Once you get started on this story of the human world of the Mud People mixing with that of the magical beings who live below ground, you just can't stop! The magical quality of the book is that it is all too believable--and so much fun! You envy Artemis his brilliance at the same time you can't believe how undenianably evil he is. You pity him, and you despise him. As for Holly Short, you love the fairy, admire her tenacity, yet hope at the same time that she spares the lives of Artemis, Butler, and Butler's sister, Juliet. I have to admit that I loved Foaly, the centaur in charge of computers and technical equipment. Actually, I loved ALL the characters of ARTEMIS FOWL, and can't wait to read the next book! Pick up a copy today! ...more Una lectura ligera y entretenida. El sentido del humor de Colfer me result\u00f3 similar al de Terry Pratchett (salvando las distancias, claro; Terry es \u00fanico) y el hecho de que el protagonista fuera un villano me gust\u00f3 mucho. (Rese\u00f1a pendiente) If I had thought of this story, I would have told it, but I would have done quite a few things differently, if possible. In other words, I like the story itself: with his family's wealth dangerously on the wane, criminal mastermind and 12 year old boy, Artemis Fowl, formulates a bold plan to kidnap a fairy and seize a ransom of gold.

But his is not the only point of view on either side of the incident. We hear from his loyal employee, Butler, as well as the fairies. This equal billing actually undermined the story for me, since it effectively confused my sympathies, not quite to the point of indifference but to something far short of involvement. This was exacerbated by a acerbic narrative voice that sometimes served the story but also unfortunately dulled character development to a sheen above caricature but below fully formed. So the incident, the kidnapping and its consequences, is a fine idea for a chapter book, hip hip hurrah, but the execution was not to my liking in ways that may or may not matter to you or its target audience. For me another big muck up included the vision of fairies. No way anyone must emulate anything in particular but Colfer's fairies rely on advanced technology and interact with each other as if human, which was ironic since they claimed to be so much more superior. His trolls, however, are wickedly offishly delightful. ...more I've seen these books in the stores for a while, but had actually steered clear of them because I thought they were just a Harry Potter knock off.

The book is a light quick read, but is very engaging. I highly recommend it to either a fantasy fan, or a young adult/children's literature fan. Enjoy! ...more This book was exactly what I wanted it to be: fun, fast-paced and entertaining. It has an original and action-packed plot, compelling characters and very interesting world building. I flew through it and if I owned the rest of the books in this series there's a real chance I wouldn't be getting much else done today. Es ideal para pasar el rato, una lectura ideal para verano, aunque no me lleno lo suficiente.

I enjoyed this more than I expected too, coming right on the heels of reading one of the Percy Jackson books, which are okay, but nothing special. (Sometimes the universe just throws books at me in clumps like that. Or, to be more precise, the London public library system.)

In the meantime, you can read the entire review at Smorgasbook This book is an interesting mix of fantasy and scifi. Hi-tech meets the fairies. I loved its world building especially all the lore on the fairies, their location, their rules and regulations etc. Artemis a genius, but my favorite characters were Butler, his butler, and Captain Holy Short, a fairy who is his victim. The book is a quick read. It will be hard to put it down even if you have to. :) So, interesting! I finally gave this a go after years of curiosity! I'd heard such mixed things about it that I finally had to discover for myself what I thought of it. End result? I totally enjoyed it! It was one of the few books that I really wasn't sure how it was going to end! And the best/worst part is that I really wasn't sure how I *wanted* it to end. Was I happy/satisfied with the ending?

I'd heard such mixed things about it that I finally had to discover for myself what I thought of it. End result? I totally enjoyed it! It was one of the few books that I really wasn't sure how it was going to end! And the best/worst part is that I really wasn't sure how I *wanted* it to end. Was I happy/satisfied with the ending? Yes. One of the main characters in this book is Artemis Fowl, a young boy (12) who's mature far beyond his years. He's smart and clever and he uses these qualities to become - a thief.... Now, I think this is where some readers have concerns because for some reason it's hard not to kind of be pulling for Artemis. He's doing pretty dastardly stuff, but there's this part of you (or, me at least) that was hoping he'd succeed. Of course, you're also hoping that there's far more to his thieving than meets the eye. Whether there is or isn't you'll have to read to find out. And, whether you agree with Artemis or not, it's a fantastic book to introduce discussions on ethics, values, black-and-white and whether or not gray areas do exist. Now, that's what I thought the book was about, a young guy who's a thief. So, imagine my surprise when all of a sudden fairies, trolls, and dwarves start showing up! I didn't realize that who Artemis was trying to steal FROM was the fairy world! But oh it was delightful!! Colfer has created this whole other fairy world that's interesting in its culture and totally technically advanced! I loved the mix of technology and old magic and traditions. I admit, I was confused at times on just HOW things worked, but I'm hoping this was due more to my lack of attention/focus (since I was listening to the audio book and thus sometimes distracted) than Colfer's writing ability. So, now we've got Artemis and his group of people, as well as Holly (a fairy in the LEP, a sort of fairy special ops) and her group of co-workers, etc. and you can't help pulling for *both* sides! This book is told from multiple perspectives, and thus new characters are introduced at various times throughout the book, so some readers might find this annoying/frustrating as it can pull you out of the main flow/action. But, the characters are so amusing that mostly I didn't mind. Also, there's some \"bad language\" - nothing you wouldn't hear in a PG-13 film, but still, for readers that don't want any... And, there's some potty humor. Now, it's some of the most refined potty humor I've come across in the way Colfer writes it in a sophisticated way - but, it is there. For myself, I thought it was funny. I listened to the audio book and loved it! Narrator Parker is one of the best I've heard for various voices and accents, and, though his style might be too much acting for some, I loved it! I'd love to go into more detail about the story, but half the fun of this book is discovering it while reading. I'm incredibly curious to continue the series and am very glad to have finally learned just who Artemis Fowl is. ***** Well wow! My \"official review\" is pending because I want to think about how to write it first. But, I did REALLY enjoy this, and honestly it's one of the few books I've read that I really did not know how it was going to end. Oddly enough, I felt it was sort of a combination of Rick Riordan meets Neil Gaiman. A tall order, I know, but that's what the style and plot reminded me of :) ***** Have any of you read this or heard anything about it? It's gotten very mixed reviews, but appears popular nonetheless. Perhaps it's one I'll have to find from a library and read a few pages first.... ...more Well, hum. What an interesting book! I enjoyed it (enhanced, I think, by the audiobook/narrator) but I'm also a bit puzzled over it. First of all, I am surprised this is a book for children. Not that there is anything horrendous or that \"adult\" in it, but it just doesn't seem like a book for kids. Sure, Artemis is twelve, but a child protagonist does not a children's book make.

Not that there is anything horrendous or that \"adult\" in it, but it just doesn't seem like a book for kids. Sure, Artemis is twelve, but a child protagonist does not a children's book make. The style doesn't seem particularly kid-friendly (lots of big vocabulary, lots of changing around between scenes/characters; but that's fine, I think kids often get too little credit in what they can comprehend and what they crave) but I think the biggest reason I have a hard time seeing this as a kids' book is that, aside from Artemis, all of the other characters are adults (again, not something you usually see in a kid's book). That said, I guess many children do like the book, so that's great! Because it *is* a good book. But, really, I feel like Colfer wrote a book for grown-ups, then was told by his agent/editor/publisher that, oh, you can't have a book feature leprechauns and a twelve-year-old protagonist be for *adults*, it had better be a kids' book. So, he took out (most of) the curse words, and added in some jokes about dwarf farts and vomit, and there you have it. A kids' book! (But, as my sister noted, it probably has some of the most refined potty humor ever!) As another reviewer notes in their excellent review, Colfer did intend to write this for children, though: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... I agree with other reviewers that it is a bit heavy-handed at times on the hatred the fairies feel for the \"mud people\" (humans) destroying the earth, and I was a bit annoyed at times, but felt satisfied by the ending. The premise here is very interesting and clever (like the LEP Recon special forces, get it, LEP Recon = leprechaun). I appreciate the world-building. And it's really interesting to have a book where you aren't quite sure who the hero is. We do switch around a lot between different characters and scenes, and this confused me a little but perhaps that was because I listened to it on commutes so my stopping points weren't always ideal breaks in the narrative. The characters seemed vivid, but that said I am not sure how much I really *cared* about them, oddly enough. I think I would look for more of the series (on audio) but I'm not zooming right out to the library to get more (unlike my husband, who liked this more than I did, I think ;-> ) I listened to the audiobook and think the narrator, Nathaniel Parker, did an outstanding job, especially with the various voices and accents. He was engaging and made it seem more interesting than just a straight read-aloud, but it also wasn't too \"theatrical.\" A very nice balance. ...more Artemis Fowl, a nefarious 12 year old criminal mastermind, and scion of a wealthy and feared family, tangles with fairies in order to make the ultimate score but these aren't the fairies you heard about in the nursery.

If you enjoy roller coasters, by all means, check this one out and like many roller coaster you may get some unique viewpoints unavailable from anywhere else but by the end of the ride, you end up pretty much back where you started. ...more I found this book rather lacking and unimaginative.

There are so many overt references to how humans are killing the planet and how evil we are and that we must answer for our atrocities, now this book is for young readers. Nothing quite like brainwashing them at a young age to the left. There were some moderately entertaining parts and that is the only reason it didn't get a 1 star. As a whole I didn't really like this book and wouldn't recommend reading it. ...more Embarrassingly, it turns out I had absolutely no idea what Artemis Fowl was about.

(And Commander Root, her bellowing cigar-chomping J. Jonah Jameson, is also great.) In short: Really vivid characters and super enjoyable plot; I am definitely going to continue reading this series. ...more Releitura depois de muitos anos. Nunca deixa de ser delicioso.

I expected and it wasn't like that at all.Thought I'm sad to say since I admire Harry Potter so much , this book is far more humorous , and more enjoyable to read then Harry Potter. Thought it is Dark it is full of humor that Harry Potter didn't have . You will go through this book in a couple of hours. This is not a copy of Harry Potter, it is not better , is not worst but they are not the same. \"A genius. A criminal mastermind. A millionaire. And he is only twelve years old.\"(Back cover of Artemis Fowl)The book Artemis Fowl is about a 12 year old mastermind named Artemis Fowl II who hatches a plan to bring his family back to their former glory. Artemis comes from a family of billionaire criminals, but when his dad disappeared after a boating accident they lost millions and Artemis makes it his personal agenda at 12 years old to not only recover that money but make more. Not that they are poor they are still have a fortune but he is obsess to recover what is loss and to prove his worth to his father because he believes his father is still alive. Artemis being the 12 year old genius that he is figures that their are easier way to make money fast and he comes up with a plan. He sees a rumor on the computer about fairies and he doesn't dismiss it and does some research. Along with Butler his psychic , bodyguard, and best friend he embarks on a journey to Vietnam where he steals a Fairy book . He then deciphers the book learning all types of Fairy secret giving him the tools he need to steal fairy gold. The way that he plans to do rob the fairies of their gold is by kidnapping of an elf or faerie and hold him or her for ransom. He captures Captain Holly Short, a member of the LEPrecon (Lower Elements Police Reconnaissance). The Fairies now live far under the Earth, having lost control of the surface long ago to the Mud People ( us), but have compensated with technological developments far in advance of our own. The Fairies not knowing what they were dealing with came after Artemis expecting to deal with him in a minute and make him forget what ever happened . They weren't ready for Artemis, throughout the whole game Artemis stays a step ahead of them even thought they have superior weaponry. They underestimated Artemis and they payed for it \"Stay back, human. You don't know what you're dealing with\"? (Holly Short) Twelve-year-old Artemis Fowl can really be described in a few words. Dangerous, rich, brilliant, and intelligent. That's one of the reason why this book is not your normal cup of tea. The hero is not a goody like Harry Potter or the normal hero types. He is the one bringing darkness to the book but you can't help but love and root for him. He is a rich bad boy dress in a $3000 Armani suit. His brilliance will make you chuckle , he is always one step ahead of the reader and the fairies. He is the perfect example of an anti-hero.\"Trust me. I'm a genius.\"(Artemis Fowl) Artemis is not all bad he has a nagging conscience that humanizes him no matter how much he tries to hide it. I loved the book. It was very good once i picked it up i couldn't put it back down.I loved that the main character was not the \"good guy\" and that our leading lady was a tough fairy. The author did a very good job in portraying both sides as having shades of grey in their characters rather than black and white/good versus bad.I picked up the book and i thought it was just going to be like Harry Potter a charming hero in a good book the fact that Artemis was not above thievery and deception was an interesting twist. Artemis' brilliance left me in a state of awe after reading this book I hope I'm as smart as him when i hit 65.\"If you were me, then I'd be you. And if I were you, I'd hide somewhere far away. \"(Artemis Fowl) I also loved the fact that Despite the book's title,Artemis does not dominate the story, though the plot pivots around his actions there are other things to the story which in my book makes it a really good story. I also love though it's categorized in children's book it's not a children book everyone who reads it will love it. The author makes sure to engage readers of all ages .At times, it almost seemed like the author couldn't decide if he was writing for adults or children. For example, the description of weaponry and attack plans made me feel like I was reading an adult spy novel. Then later on in the chapter, when the Dwarf blasts someone with dirt he has recently \"eaten and decomposed\" it's pretty clear what age group he was shooting for then.I recommend Artemis Fowl to anyone who likes fantasy and adventure with a slight twist of mystery. I really liked Artemis Fowl, it was interesting, exciting, funny, and it really kept you guessing as to what Artemis was going to come up with next. 5 out of 5 for me i will definitely read the rest of the series. ...more About aforesaid twelve-year-old criminal mastermind and his attempts to restore the faltering Fowl fortunes by swindling fairies.

The series takes off sprinting from there with a lot of plots, gun fights, explosions, dirty tricks, uneasy alliances, and really freaking shiny gadgets. Oh, man, where were these books when I was ten? Eoin (it\u2019s pronounced \u201cOwen,\u201d roughly) Colfer taught elementary school for many years, and he said in an interview that he partly started writing because he felt like existing kid lit neither provided what kids really want, nor gave them enough credit as readers. These books do both, if sales are any indication, not to mention my own complete absorption. Artemis Fowl doesn\u2019t really have a villain, as much as Artemis would protest, but just the smartest and loneliest boy in the world facing off against a bunch of paranoid, superior fairy cops who also turn out to be funny, compassionate, wonderful characters. The succeeding books shift Artemis in and out of the criminal role, as well as alliance with the fairies as they work together to vanquish goblin rebellions and demon time spells, and Colfer does an exquisitely timed dance as he flashes the very shinyshinycool things about being a criminal genius, and also shows Artemis to be a deeply flawed child. The shiny factor is high, and these books were just right for this past week -- vicious flu and crushing amounts of work. But Colfer doesn't stint on complexity, either. This is how to write a Gary-Stue \u2013 make him the smartest boy in the world, arrogant, nearly unbeatable. And then make this also his weakness, his isolation. Make him truly dangerous, truly sympathetic, truly pitiable. Damage him in real and painful ways, abandon him to build his own moral code, and then gently show, without preaching or moralizing, the ways he is broken. And then rebuild his family across species and great divides, and let it be as complicated as the reader wants it to be. And let him grow up in meaningful and sometimes hilarious ways, still extraordinary but also so familiar. Also, did I mention, the technology is really shiny? Contact lens cameras! Shuttles that ride lava currents! Anti-grav belts! Magic fairy invisibility shields! Man. I might have to stop complaining about my bad luck with boring kid lit if this streak keeps up. ...more I have heard amazing things about the Artemis Fowl Series for a very long time, but I haven\u2019t picked up the series until now. My first impression? Well, Artemis is a genius, but his actions within the novel, kidnapping a faery, for one, put me off of him and I spent a lot of the novel really disliking him. However, the more I read, the more I realized he was just putting on a fa\u00e7ade. Artemis is good at heart, though he\u2019s committing multiple crimes, and I actually really liked him by the end.

I was afraid that this novel might be a bit childish for my tastes, but I was so very wrong. I actually spent much of the novel on pins and needles, dying to know what would happen next a Colfer entices the reader deeper into the story, jumping back and forth between scenes and giving the reader an omniscient glimpse into everything that is happening simultaneously, both above, and under, the ground. This is a great read. Overall, this is a really cute story that I think any MG, YA, or adult will really enjoy. Colfer has a way with words and he spins an intriguing tale, giving the reader access to another world as he builds the race of the faeries, bringing everything to a head as Artemis and the faeries square off against one another.
