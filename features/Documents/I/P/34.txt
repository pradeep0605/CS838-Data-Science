Kavita, a poor village woman, has just given birth to an infant daughter she names Usha. Terrified that her husband will murder the daughter because she's a girl, she journeys to Mumbai to place Usha in an orphanage. Meanwhile, Somer and Krishnan, a California couple struggling with infertility, decide to adopt an Indian orphan and end up with Usha. The book follows the twists and turns in these characters' lives as Kavita and her family experience changes of location and fortune and Somer and Krishnan raise Usha (<---B>whom they call Asha</---B>) who eventually seeks her roots in India. There were moments in this book which resonated and smacked of psychological complexity. Somer initially finds it difficult to bond with her new infant; Kavita comes to appreciate her husband despite his flaws; Kavita's husband eventually regrets and examines his zealousness to get rid of his infant daughter. But for the most part, the story was told in a way that seemed almost rushed as it spanned two decades. I didn't feel that I got to know any of the characters; the vicissitudes in their relationships and fortunes passed me by without my getting caught up in them. Where I often find myself complaining about the slow pacing in books, this was a case where the rapidity with which events unfolded precluded my feeling anything about them. It wasn't a bad book, but the fact that it could have been so much better than it was made for a disappointing reading experience. Not to mention the high goodreads rating and Amazon's placing it on a list of 100 Best Books of 2010. ...more Jo\u0161 jedna od predivnih \"indijskih\" pri\u010da koja nas upoznaje s nama manje poznatim \u010dinjenicama iz indijske kulture i \u017eivota... \u0160ta zna\u010di roditi se kao \u017eensko dete u indijskoj siroma\u0161noj porodici...

Meanwhile another couple from America, Somer and Krishnan can\u2019t have a baby and decide to adopt, connecting the lives of these two very different couples separated by thousand of miles. And thus begins this really touching tale of their lives and the daughter who binds them. There are numerous things that could have gone wrong with this story. It could have turned out into one of those Bollywood family movies, filled with melodrama and tears and an over sweetened \u201chappily ever after\u201d. Or it could have got really preachy and irritating. But somehow, the author created a beautiful balance between all the factors to give us this amazing story. What I really loved about this book was that every character was allowed to present its point of view. Jasu wasn\u2019t made out to be this really evil villain, free of any kind of remorse for the mistake he committed. The society, the mindset, which views girls as a burden, was well portrayed. India was neither glorified nor overly ridiculed. In fact, the author has painted a very true picture of this country. Truly, it is a land of many contradictions. The story also has one of the best ending I have read recently. (view spoiler) [Somer discovering herself before reconciling with her family, Asha understanding the sacrifices her mother made for her, and Kavita and Jasu discovering their love for each other. It just couldn't have been better. (hide spoiler) ] How beautifully she wrapped up the whole story. It really gave you closure, and that nice giddy feeling you get after reading a nice book. I remember smiling for a very long time after finishing it. Truly amazing. Can\u2019t wait to read other books the author writes after such a stunning debut. 5 sparkling stars and highly recommended, especially for Jhumpa Lahiri fans!! :D ...more This is a story that beautifully and creatively tackles many controversial issues.

(Issue one) Krishnan, an Indian man and Somer, a caucasian woman, think nothing of the difference in their cultures until a trip to India shows Somer the world from which Krishnan comes from. She does a double take and wonders how well she really knows her husband. Issue two: motherhood. Somer wants to have a baby so bad but her body does not agree with her. After adopting a little girl, Asha from India, she begins to wonder if some women just aren't meant for motherhood. Can she do this? Can she love and understand a child that does not come from her own womb? Issue three is foreign adoption. Asha grows up questioning her parentage. What is her homeland like? Who are her real parents? When reading her parts, readers witness the daily inner turnmoil an adopted child faces, the feeling of being unwanted, the questions, the being \"stuck\" between two cultures. Where do I belong? Issue four and possibly the biggest issue of all is the practice of killing young baby daughters in India. The poor do not want daughters because they can't work in the fields and require a dowry later in life. How many tiny, unmarked graves are scattered throughout India? Also addressed is the Indian caste system. While watching Asha grow up in America with all the spoils of American children, readers all see what is going on in the other side of the world with Asha's biological parents as they stuggle to make a life in Bombay, to rise above oppression and try and try again to \"step up\" a class or two. Will making ends meet be enough? Thru their eyes, we see the slums of India, the drugs, the gangs. When a grown Asha heads to India for a year, she has many questions and no answers. Will she leave India with answers and if so, will they be the answers she wants? Will she find her biological parents or will all these people go thru their lives without meeting? An even stronger question is: Can either mother let go? A beautiful story closely following the lives of four very different people. I found myself thinking of these people even when I wasn't reading the book. I especially enjoyed the in depth look at life in India. It beats watching an espisode of Taboo anyday. Highly recommended. ...more SPOILERS This novel proudly boasts a #1 Canadian Bestseller sticker. I personally can't understand why. In 1984, an Indian woman named Kavita gives birth to a baby girl.

A year later Somer and Krishnan Thakker, an American-Indian couple, adopt the baby and bring her home to California SPOILERS This novel proudly boasts a #1 Canadian Bestseller sticker. I personally can't understand why. In 1984, an Indian woman named Kavita gives birth to a baby girl. Fearful that her husband, Jasu, will dispose of this baby the same way he did to their first daughter, Kavita and her sister deliver this baby to an orphanage in Bombay, but tell Jasu that the baby died in the night. A year later Somer and Krishnan Thakker, an American-Indian couple, adopt the baby and bring her home to California. Kavita mourns for her secret daughter even while raising her third child, the long-awaited son, and while learning to accept her husband for who he is. The baby, named Asha, grows up to be a promising journalist, and wins an internship with a major newspaper in India, so she travels to her country of birth for the first time and lives with her father's family, who are strangers to her. She of course seeks out her birth parents, but she never meets them face-to-face, finally coming to accept that her adopted family has given her everything she needs. This book should have been a powerful and emotional read. True, it sheds light on the complexities of family, as well as the terrible living conditions that many Indians suffer. However, any child growing up in twenty-first century North America should be somewhat aware of the devastating contrast between living in India and living in North America. Asha isn't. Though her adoptive mother's surpression of her daughter's Indian heritage can be blamed for some of her ignorance, this young woman is a budding journalist. Should she not have some global awareness of international issues, especially those that relate to the country in which she works? It is hard to be patient with her as she slowly matures through the time she spends in India. When she finally comes around, it almost feels too late. I felt the same frustration with Somer. The character is instantly unlikeable, ignorant and dismissive of her husband's heritage. Any sympathy the reader feels for her struggles with infertility are instantly erased when she arrives in Indian and labels the men \"disgusting pigs\". Perhaps it is because I read this book immediately after reading THE LOST GIRLS, in which the authors are open-minded to every type of person they encounter, but I could not tolerate Somer's prejudice. She, like her daughter, experiences an epiphany in the error of her ways, but she is in her mid-fifties at this point, after almost thirty years married to an Indian man. It is much too late. I could go on about my thoughts on the other characters, but I don't want to drag this out. Besides, every reader should form his or her unbiased opinion. I unfortunately found every character two-dimensional and unrealistic... something I did not expect in a novel which receives such high praise and has such an intriguing plot. ...more Emotionally impacting, culture intense, and intricately engaging. <+++>Secret Daughter</+++> is a tightly written, realistic novel exploring family dynamics in relation to infertility, adoption, economics, poverty/wealth, and mixed culture relationships; moreover, it's a novel exploring the complexities of the unique cords forever binding (in one form or another) mothers and daughters - daughters and mothers. \" Sometimes, as she has well learned in life, one's actions must precede the emotions one hopes to Emotionally impacting, culture intense, and intricately engaging. <+++>Secret Daughter</+++> is a tightly written, realistic novel exploring family dynamics in relation to infertility, adoption, economics, poverty/wealth, and mixed culture relationships; moreover, it's a novel exploring the complexities of the unique cords forever binding (in one form or another) mothers and daughters - daughters and mothers. \" Sometimes, as she has well learned in life, one's actions must precede the emotions one hopes to feel.\" Nature vs nurture. What exactly drives us to be who we are? Like what we like? Do what we do? As an adoptee, myself, those types of questions burned through my mind from adolescence onward, just as they did for Kavita's daughter and Somer's daughter. Along with other questions, too: Who do I look like? Where are my people from? Why did my mother and father give me away? Was I a financial burden? Sickly? Or simply an inconvenience? Or were my parents deemed unfit, or too young, or scandalously unmarried? And why, when I pose these questions to my adopted mother, does she respond so vehemently defensive, vague, and obtuse; as if wounded and rejected, herself. \"It's just not fair . . . I've spent sixteen years not knowing, sixteen years asking questions nobody can answer. I just don't feel like I really belong, in this family or anywhere. It's like a piece of me is always missing. Don't you understand that?\" Gowda provides readers with viewpoints, nuances, and idiosyncrasies from both sides of the adoption coin, as well as the culture coin - Indian and American. As this richly heartfelt story unfolds, she takes readers into the hearts of three main characters (Kavita, Somer, Asha) - in addition to a few key support characters - through their distinct voices, hearts, worldviews, hopes, dreams, faiths, doubts, fears, joys, and cultures. We discover: the cord that binds the heart of mother and child, can reach across a thousand miles and may never to be broken; stretched thin, perhaps; frayed and faded, a bit; but never fully broken. I can't think of a more perfect book I could have read after my recent reunion with my sister, Sherrie Miller. My beautiful, bodacious, birth sister! After fifty-three years of separation, having no clue where on earth I genetically originated from, I finally identified and found all my maternal birth siblings. (See Hanna Family Tree in my photos - aren't we a lovely bunch???) It has been a joyous, overwhelming and exiting experience connecting with my birth family - in addition to remaining connected to my wonderful adopted sister too. The characters and storyline in Gowda's novel, didn't really mirror my adoption/reunion experience. But what story does? Everyone's story is uniquely their own. That's one of the joys of reading: to gain understanding and appreciation for each others similarities and differences. Whether or not you or someone you know has been touched by adoption, gender selection, infertility, or mixed marriage/relationships, this is a novel that can be read and absorbed and genuinely felt by most all. The story is engaging and clearly communicated. Gowda richly painted Indian culture depicting the many complex facets of economics, living centers, family dynamics, faith, beliefs, customs, and language. I found the glossary in the back ever so helpful. The characters and dialogue come across as genuine. The story-line didn't bog down in trivialities or meander needlessly hither and yon; however, it did jump around a bit and lag somewhat mid book. And some chapters felt a bit cut off. As if the word count was too long and that was the quickest way to prune???? Appreciatively though, Gowda didn't fabricated a \"Disney\" ending; nor did she turn it into a total Shakespearean tragedy, either. Overall, a highly recommendable novel to fans of realistic contemporary fiction who embrace family dramas and/or enjoy exploring world cultures, women's issues, adoption, and mother/daughter relationships.

Female infanticide was rampant just Shout out to GR friend Pamela who steered me to this wonderful novel. I hadn\u2019t heard of it before she reviewed it. What a story! Author Shilpi Somaya Gowda did her research in learning the Indian Cultures and the amazing disparity of cultures and languages within India. For example, I didn\u2019t realize there are twenty-one major languages in India, as well as English. Although there is significant wealth in India, there is also major poverty and backward customs. Female infanticide was rampant just decades ago, and still occurs today. This is an emotional novel that is full of cultural information. I truly enjoyed learning about India, although much was disturbing. The story is told from the perspectives of three major characters: Kavita, an impoverished Indian woman who needs to give up her daughter to save her; Somer, a California woman who marries an Indian man and learns she is infertile; and Asha, the daughter Kavita gave up who was adopted by Somer and her husband. The heart of the novel is each woman\u2019s growth in perspective. The greatest growth was in Asha and Somer. Asha, being adopted, struggled with her identity. She loves her parents, but has curiosity about her birth parents. All her struggles she deems to be the result of her parents not understanding her; she thinks her birth parents would understand her better. Somer wants to be the perfect mother and fears her daughter\u2019s independence, which strains her marriage. I enjoy this technique of showing the different perspectives because the reader is able to understand well-meaning actions that are perceived differently. Author Gowda writes all her characters as flawed, yet well meaning. It\u2019s a beautiful story of growth. Gowda used Kavita to illuminate some of the poverty conditions of India and how that affects living choices. Kavita\u2019s story shows the struggles of the impoverished to work them up from poverty, while trying to be good people. This is a wonderful story that describes the conflicting feelings of adopted children and the fears of the adoptive parents. And it\u2019s a beautiful story of family: what makes a family. A beautiful quote from the novel: At some point, the family you create is more important than the one you\u2019re born into. For Adoptive families, this rings true. It\u2019s a great read. ...more Wonderful book! If this is the author's first novel, I can't wait to read her second!

In the meantime, Somar, an American woman married to an Indian man, suffers 2 miscarriages and learns she will never have a biological child. They adopt Asha, and the story proceeds from there. Somar has troubles with the cultural differences between India and the United States, and constantly worries that she will lose Asha to her biological mother. Asha wonders about her birth parents and who she really is. Krishnan, Somar's husband, balances missing his family and India with adopting American culture.

The following are facts from the book, not a review! The struggle for women's rights in India: infanticide of baby girls, dowry deaths, bride burning, sex selective abortions. Bride-burning is a form of domestic violence practiced in India .It is not the same as ancient and long abolished (formally abolished in 1829) custom of Sati, where widowed women were forcefully placed on a burning pyre of the dead husband (usually a man in his old age) and burnt to death. This has been treated as culpable homicide and if proven, is punishable accordingly (mostly up to death sentence or life imprisonment) According to Indian National Crime Record Bureau, there were 1,948 convictions and 3,876 acquittals in dowry death cases in 2008.Accounts for around 600-750 deaths per year in India alone. In 1995 Time Magazine reported that dowry deaths in India increased from around 400 a year in the early 1980s to around 5,800 a year by the middle of the 1990s. A year later CNN ran a story saying that every year police receive more than 2,500 reports of bride burning. Dowry deaths are the deaths of young women who are murdered or driven to suicide by continuous harassment and torture by husbands and in-laws in an effort to extort an increased dowry. Dowry deaths are reported in various South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Dowry death is considered one of the many categories of violence against women in South Asia. According to Indian National Crime Record Bureau, there were 1948 convictions and 3876 acquittals in dowry death cases in year 2008. Most dowry deaths occur when the young woman, unable to bear the harassment and torture, commits suicide. Most of these suicides are by hanging, poisoning or by fire. Sometimes the woman is killed by setting her on fire; this is known as \"bride burning\", and sometimes disguised as suicide or accident. Mother India does not love all her children equally. Girls are killed or put in orphanages. Males now pay to bring a bride from Bangladesh. How much wrongness can you tolerate? Partition-1947.

Initially, there was little opportunity to become engaged with the characters as the time jumps meant that almost every time you read their next POV they were a different person in a different scenario. Once the story settled with 20-year-old Asha things smoothed out a bit and you had the chance to get to know the characters a bit better, but only a bit because there just wasn't that much room left in the book, and simply not enough depth to the characters to become invested in them. I think there were two books in this novel, 1) an adoption story of contrasts and family and 2)an adoption story of finding identity and wholeness. Both stories were short-changed in this book, not for lack of ability on the part of the author, just too much story for one book-club-sized book. ...more An infant daughter is left at a Mumbai orphanage because the family is too poor to raise her.

Seriously boring, but she was a nice person, so I tried it for her. Phew. Do you ever find a book unavoidable? Your mom is reading it, your friends are reading it, there's chatter about it on Facebook, and strangers on the bus are poring through it?

It's a terrific book.\" My expectations were high\u2013slightly too high in the end. In Secret Daughter, author Shilpi Somaya Gowda juxtaposes the stories Do you ever find a book unavoidable? Your mom is reading it, your friends are reading it, there's chatter about it on Facebook, and strangers on the bus are poring through it? Secret Daughter was such a book for me so when I saw it on a shelf in Buy the Book, my local used bookstore, I picked it up. The bookseller even chimed in with, \"Great choice. It's a terrific book.\" My expectations were high\u2013slightly too high in the end. In Secret Daughter, author Shilpi Somaya Gowda juxtaposes the stories of two women struggling against circumstances beyond their control. First we meet Kavita, a young woman in a rural India who gives birth to a girl. Her husband Jasu is a poor farmer. He only wants a baby boy who can contribute to, rather than drain, the family's meagre resources. With the threat of infanticide looming (in the horrifying opening scene we learn Jasu had the couple's firstborn girl killed), Kavita flees with the baby and leaves her at an orphanage in Mumbai before returning home. Next we meet Californian Somer (the cheesy name fits), who seems to lead a charmed existence. She's ambitious, privileged and married to charming Krishnan, whom she met in medical school. But after a series of miscarriages, Somer learns she's infertile so despite her many other accomplishments, she feels unfulfilled. The stage is set. Somer and Krishnan return to his native Mumbai and adopt Kavita's baby. (Don't worry. All this is so obvious from the start I'm not giving anything away.) The plot from there examines the clash between American and Indian culture in both countries. It also examines themes of loss, longing, forgiveness and acceptance in mainly predictable yet believable ways. The problem is not in the storyline so much as how it is told. Here is a story loaded with potential I didn't feel was realized. The writing never sung for me; I didn't once stop to reread a sentence simply because of how beautifully it was structured. I would describe the writing style as: this happened, then that happened, then something else happened, which resulted in this. At the end the characters are enlightened and reflective, but it is too little, too late. I don't regret having read Secret Daughter. It is a quick read but like a quick snack, it didn't leave me feeling full. I wasn't able to forgive Jasu for ordering his firstborn girl murdered, although the author treated him sympathetically. I never fell in love with either main character, especially Somer. She struck me as privileged and her disdain for Indian culture was stereotypical. Her eventual awakening coincides with her taking up yoga, which seemed like a clich\u00e9. The author, an Indo-Canadian/American, draws upon her heritage effectively to compare the different wedding customs, marriage, food, grooming and parenting norms in each culture. She also examines life in the infamous Mumbai slum Dharavi, and the declining birth rates of Indian girls compared with boys beginning in the 1980s due to widespread infanticide and the introduction of ultrasound technology (which led to the abortion of many female fetuses). So while there were parts of this book that held my attention and while I understand its appeal, the reading experience, for me, was like eating a chapati when I craved spicy paneer. ...more Great parallel stories of an American woman and Indian woman connected by one child. It was enjoyable to learn a bit about the Indian culture with the author's vivid descriptions. Many topics are touched in this novel such as adoption, self-discovery, and what truly makes a family. The ending was emotional. It will stay with me.

Where would I be now? Or, what if he\u2019d found a clinic that performed gender identification ultrasounds? Is it possible that I wouldn\u2019t exist at all? Secret Daughter explores many of life\u2019s \u201cwhat -ifs.\u201d This is the story of two families who \u2013 due to both necessity and survival \u2013 make decisions that affect them for the rest of their lives. Author Gowda writes this book from several points of view, including those of a birth mother and an adoptive mother who have nothing in common except that they fight to love a daughter they\u2019ve both won and lost. This story is also from the point of view of the daughter in question \u2013 Asha \u2013 who is pulled in so many directions and ultimately finds that what she was looking for was right under her nose the entire time. From the character driven chapter structure to the honest writing; from the admirable characters to the difficult life choices \u2013 this book is nothing short of phenomenal. The reader can\u2019t help but be drawn to the characters as they battle their own demons and insecurities, as they struggle to relate and survive, and as they fight to hold on to what little they have. Most importantly, however, is the fact that the shocking plight of the people we pretend don\u2019t exist will touch, fascinate, amaze, and inspire those of us who are fortunate enough to read this beautiful book. Bottom Line: The only thing wrong with this book is the fact that author Shilpi Somaya Gowda has set the bar so high with her debut novel that I fear nothing I write will ever come close. ...more I would like to give this 2-1/2 stars. Secret Daughter was an okay read. It was fairly innocuous. I thought that the author played safe with the subject matter she wrote about. The themes were: infanticide of girl babies in India; extreme poverty in India; mother/daughter relationships; adoption; interractial relationships...

The third book, told from Asha's point of view could have delved into how she felt as an adopted child searching for her birth mother and for her place in the world. Another book could have explored the abject poverty of the slums and told by Asha's brother. Yes, that's what I have decided. Turn the book into a series of books, flesh out the characters more, provide more descriptive language, and really explore the issues instead of just skimming over the surface. ...more This was an easy read that I finished in a couple of days.

The description of how women actually do have a certain power in the culture was a refreshing change. The rich descriptions of India from the poverty to the importance of family and tradition to the frustrating limits to success made me devour those pages.

I really enjoyed this well balanced novel - set in both India and America, it is narrated by several of the characters but never becomes confusing or dull. Many complex issues are covered, including adoption from third world countries into affluent Western families and the extreme poverty that can force a family to dispose of female offspring. I found the issues sensitively handled throughout and admit to crying towards the end. (The sure sign of a good book!). There are several main characters who all form part of the narrative; Kavita and Jasu from a poverty stricken area of India, and American Somer and her Indian husband Krishnan from San Fransisco and California. Their daughter Usha/Asha binds the future of the two families when she is adopted and moved to US. The journey that Kavita and Jasu make to Bombay, to search for their hope of a better life, was an eye opener, and the wealthy family that Krishnan comes from was also interesting, with the matriach, Dadima holding everything together. There were some interesting contrasts - the slum life of Mumbai vs the riches of America, and the strength of the arranged marriages in India vs the stresses of modern life on the love matches of the West. It certainly provided food for thought. Although the overall feel of the book was that the women were frequently the stronger characters, the men also played a vital role but their characters had less chance to speak. I was fascinated to read that the author spent a summer as a volunteer in an Indian orphanage; being of Indian descent and living in America, I felt that it was a book written from the heart. Certainly an author I will read again. Recommended. ...more i found this story interesting. there are two families that we follow. one family - kavita, jasu and their son vijay - live in mumbai. when kavita gives birth to two girls before vijay, one is taken away by her husband jasu the moment the baby is declared a girl and the other is put into an orphanage. kavita lives her life mourning both losses. drs. krishnan and somer adopt asha from a mumbai orphange. this asha is kavita's baby. the story takes place over a course of twenty years or so and we f i found this story interesting. there are two families that we follow. one family - kavita, jasu and their son vijay - live in mumbai. when kavita gives birth to two girls before vijay, one is taken away by her husband jasu the moment the baby is declared a girl and the other is put into an orphanage. kavita lives her life mourning both losses. drs. krishnan and somer adopt asha from a mumbai orphange. this asha is kavita's baby. the story takes place over a course of twenty years or so and we follow kavita's story and somer's story. and then asha's story. it is interesting to see the clash of cultures (american and indian) that takes place between somer and her in-laws. it is also interesting to get a look at the various classes in india. some portions of the book felt pushed along a bit too quickly, but i found it to be a satisfying read. ...more This is an extremely well crafted story.

Shilpi Somaya Gowda\u2019s debut novel, Secret Daughter , is about daughters. It's also about sons and husbands and wives and grandmothers, but the primary relationship she focuses on is that between mother and daughter. Mothers and daughters, whether bound by blood or not; mothers and daughters, whether they know each other by face or not. In 1984, a poor village woman, Kavita, realizes that the only way she can keep her newborn baby daughter alive is by giving her away to an orphanage: her husband, Shilpi Somaya Gowda\u2019s debut novel, Secret Daughter , is about daughters. It's also about sons and husbands and wives and grandmothers, but the primary relationship she focuses on is that between mother and daughter. Mothers and daughters, whether bound by blood or not; mothers and daughters, whether they know each other by face or not. In 1984, a poor village woman, Kavita, realizes that the only way she can keep her newborn baby daughter alive is by giving her away to an orphanage: her husband, adamant on having a son, knows that he cannot afford a daughter and the dowry she will need when she grows up \u2013 he has already taken away from Kavita her firstborn daughter and had her quietly killed. So Kavita trudges to Mumbai with her sister and hands her three-day old daughter into an orphanage. Halfway across the world, an American paediatrician named Somer, married to an Indian neurosurgeon, Krishnan Thakkar, discovers the devastating truth after several miscarriages: that she can never bear a child. Initially reluctant to accept Krishnan\u2019s suggestion that they adopt a child, Somer finally agrees \u2013 and the child they get is Asha, the same baby whom Kavita had left at the orphanage a year earlier. Two stories play out simultaneously: Somer and her husband and daughter in the US, and in India, Kavita and her husband and the son she bears. In California, Somer finds herself gradually drifting away from Krishnan and Asha, their Indianness binding them together, her resentment growing even though she continues to love them both. Back in India, Kavita\u2019s husband Jasu is driven by poverty to shift to Mumbai, and the little family arrives in the horrifying slum of Dharavi\u2026 where, years later, a twenty-year old Asha, now an aspiring journalist and yearning to find her birth parents, comes. For a while, this seemed to me to be gearing up to be rather like an old Hindi film. The child separated from parents. The distinctive silver bangle, the only reminder of Asha\u2019s mother, which Kavita had placed on her infant wrist. Near brushes between mother and daughter in the teeming metropolis. Somaya Gowda, thankfully, does not go the whole hog and turn this into a Bollywood screenplay. Instead, this is a story not just of relationships, but also of how the choices we make \u2013 for whatever reason, often seeming true and good at the time - can have unforeseen consequences. It is about journeys, not just literal but also, more importantly, about the journey through life: of learning about oneself and about people around. Of forgiving, of accepting, of building bridges. I liked the plot of this book (before you start going by the fact that it\u2019s an international bestseller, let me warn you: this is \u2018literature lite\u2019: it\u2019s good, just not as impressive as I'd expect from something with such rave reviews. For me, as an Indian, what really got in the way of enjoying Secret Daughter were the number of jarring, often cringeworthy errors caused by poor research. Two names, for instance: Krishnan (as any Indian will know, obviously a name from South India) coupled with the last name Thakkar \u2013 and a Gujarati? (Yes, there could've been an interesting story about how and why a Gujarati family decided to give their son a Dravidian name, but since it\u2019s never mentioned, I\u2019m guessing this is a case of the author not knowing). Or the poor farmer named Jasu Merchant . Highly, highly unlikely. Or (and this one was hilarious), the motorbike and scooter tycoon Rajaj. And then there are sad distortions of Hindi words, like lengha (instead of lehenga ) and khadi for kadhi . Or the bizarre explanation that a jamai (son-in-law) is the wedding procession in which the groom comes to the ceremony. Yes, if I hadn't been Indian and/or hadn't known too much about this country, I'd probably have liked Secret Daughter much more. ...more This was another happy suprise read.

After devestating miscarriages and medical testing they make the decision to adopt a child from India. In India, a young mother watches her husband take her first born daughter away from her directly after the birth-daughters are not wanted, only sons. When she discovers she is again pregnant she fears her husband will again take the baby. After the birth of her second daughter she names her and makes the difficult journey to the city (Mumbai) and leaves her 2nd daughter at an orphanage. The daughter is adopted by the Indian-American family and grows up in California. The novel chronicles her journey as well as that of her adopted parents and in turn her biological parents as they make the decision to move to Mumbai after the birth of their son. It is a heart wrenching story of strife, perseverance, discovery of self, finding a sense of belonging and above all familial love. I highly recommend this book.
