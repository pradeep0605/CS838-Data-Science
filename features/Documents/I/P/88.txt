Shortly into the book I kind of made up my mind that it would only ever be a four star book because it lacked structure. But by about the fourth or fifth chapter, I decided that was the author's voice and it made for an engaging read \u2014 I became hooked on his style and enjoyed it. I liked the random ramblings and he never lost the point while digressing and the tangents he went onto were always interesting. The personal interjections were great (<---B>whether one agrees with the author's opinion or not</---B>). It all added to the flavor of his experiences. Cab drivers are notoriously opinionated and this book proves it, and that is its great strength and charm (I'm sure Mr. Wiggins will get a giggle that a found his book charming.) I would also add for the would be readers, this is written by a Londoner and as a Londoner speaks. There are no airs and graces which keeps it authentic. Non-British readers may be slightly perplexed by some of the lingo and jargon,<---M> but trust me</---M>, you'll know what he means. Laughter is international, and as long as you're not sensitive to politically incorrectness, this book will make you laugh. ...more The author portrays the gritty life of a mini cab driver from excellent hand-hand knowledge. The story is hilarious and honest to a fault. Who would have thought the life of a cab driver could be so adventuresome. Thoroughly entertaining and a blast to read! This is a realist look at the world as seen from the perspective of a London cabbie.<---F> Drama, humo(u)r, pain</---F>...it's all here. Through his contact with thousands of people during a variety of jobs the author has become an astute observer of human nature and he uses his insights to great effect when relating his experiences as a mini-cab driver. The writing is honest, the characters are described with the kind of detail that brings them to life on the page and the author does not shy away from the sometimes brutal encounters in a mini-cab driver's job.

The writing is honest, the characters are described with the kind of detail that brings them to life on the page and the author does not shy away from the sometimes brutal encounters in a mini-cab driver's job. The author has strongly-held views which are put forward with intelligence and though I may not agree with all of them there is no doubting the eloquence with which they are argued. Personally I found the chapters that deal with his time in Los Angeles fascinating. As well as being a good read (I laughed out loud several times) the book has surprising depth to it and is thought-provoking. It is pleasing on many levels and I recommend it as well worth reading. ...more Well written! Enjoyed the stories! Writers that draw one in and Help one to transcend time and place etc are my favorites. Got a sense of An overall philosophical sense of the cabbie as well! Nice one!
