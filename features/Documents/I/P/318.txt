{"Comments": "<+++>Colonization</+++>This amazing novel of realistic interstellar colonization could be categorized \"hard science fiction\",<---M> \"space opera\"</---M>, and \"romance\". While the book as a whole tells the story of the CP-4 colony, it tells their story in five parts that nicely tie together. The characters are well fleshed out and easy to relate to. You can't help but to be drawn in and wonder what comes next. The story, much like Star Trek, could continue onward forever if the author so chose. Hope to see more in the future An amazing space opera along the lines of Haldeman, Steele, and McDevitt. Great storyline that draws you in to the newly colonized world of Kepler Moon Alpha and you can't help but to care about the characters and their lives, their adventures, and their survival. Would recommend this to fans of Coyote or even The Martian.<---A>Scott McElhaney</---A><---C>Scott McElhaney</---C><+++>Colonization</+++>", "Title": "Colonization"},
