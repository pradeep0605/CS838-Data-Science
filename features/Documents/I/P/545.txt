Hot enough so you don't feel anything but me. So you don't think of anything but what I'm doing to you. I want you liquid. I loved this book! Rhage is definitely one of the guys at the top of the BDB fav list <3 Uber-hot, and such an amazing hero! A total must-read! The story After meeting a boy who looks to be a pretransitioned vampire, Bella decides to take him to the Brotherhood, along with her neighbor Mary, who knows the kid and can translate for him. The kid, John Matthew, is mute, and doesn't know anything about himself or his parents, and is practically living on the streets. Mary wants to help him, so she agrees to go with him to the \"training facility\", not knowing it is in fact the Brotherhood's safe house. The brothers recognize him as one of their own, with a warrior name of Tehrror. On the first visit with John, Mary meets Rhage, the most beautiful man she's ever seen, who, for some reason, is drawn to her like crazy. Even though Rhage knows he can't make any commitment to a woman like Mary, he needs to have her, whatever it takes. After a few dates, kisses and memory wipes, Rhage is torn between his emotions and his loyalty to the Brotherhood. He needs to protect Mary, and wants to be with her, even though that is against the rules. Luckily, Rhage was never one to follow them ;) \"I\u2019m a vampire. I\u2019m a warrior. I\u2019m a dangerous beast. At the end of this evening, you aren\u2019t going to remember you ever met me. And the idea of not even being a memory of yours makes me feel like I\u2019ve been stabbed in the chest.\" The story - I loved the Rhage/Mary romance. Loved! It was very emotional and beautiful, most of all, very HOT indeed :D There are several new storylines included, the one about John Matthew, a new character, and we are introduced to Bella, the heroine from the third book :) The writing - we get multiple POVs, from the MCs and now the new characters, John and Bella, as well as Butch and maybe a few others, don't remember all of them :) Anyway, for me that's just a bonus, never liked just the one-person-POV, so... The hotness - OMG this book is uber-hot! Rhage is really REALLY direct and says what's on his mind, usually everything sexy ahahhahahhaha but yeah, schorching-hot! The cliffhanger - it has nothing to do with Rhage and Mary, but still, my advice is to have the third book already open on the first page 'cause you won't be able to stop yourself from reading it ASAP! \u201cI will not fall in love with you,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t let myself. I won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll love you enough for the both of us.\u201d Mary has been ill for some time, and now her leukemia is back. She's afraid of the treatments and knows what's waiting for her. Having low self esteem because of her physical condition, she can't think of any possible reason why would Rhage be interested in her. She constantly pushes him back and thinks he's making fun of her, or that he just wants to be friends. Even though she made me want to kick her at some points in the book, I really liked Mary :) She is a strong character, despite her illness, she's used to taking care of herself, and doesn't lean on anyone for support. She really likes Rhage, but doesn't think he wants to be with her, and I have to say I just love that scene when she found out that he's a vampire :D Anyway, she's not one for crying and moping, and I liked that too :D I think my fav scene with her is when she pets the beast on the head :DDD \"What you just had is nothing compared to what I want to do to you. I want my head between your legs so I can lick you until you scream my name. Then I want to mount you like an animal and look into your eyes as I come inside of you. And after that? I want to take you every way there is. I want to do you from behind. I want to screw you standing up, against the wall. I want you to sit on my hips and ride me until I can\u2019t breathe.\" Rhage was cursed by the Scribe Virgin to transform into a huge terrible beast whenever he goes out of control. To prevent the beast from getting out, he uses fighting and sex to release his frustrations. Even though everyone envies him for being such a hit with the women, Rhage just feels hollow because of it, there is no real enjoyment in it for him, just means to an end. That is, until he meets Mary :) He's shocked by the attraction he feels because he hasn't felt it before for anyone, and he's willing to do whatever it takes to be with her, even though it seems that she's not very interested in him XD Rhage is one of my favorite Brothers <3 I adore him! I couldn't help but sympathize with him, and feel sorry when he went on the sex prowl :((( He is sick and tired of that life, but must keep doing it to prevent the best from coming out, and possibly hurting the people he cared about, the Brotherhood. He meets Mary and can't stay away from her, and the more time they spend together, the more he realises she is meant for him, and he wants to bond with her. The only problem is Mary shutting him down, and not trusting him. But the end! Oh the end made me love him, what he did was just... Beautiful! I cried at that part, it was so emotional <3 He deserved his happy end, and the way it was made, just how it was meant to be :))) My favorite quotes from other characters: \u201cLast night, I\u2026ah\u2026I drove out to Marissa\u2019s brother\u2019s house.

And I don\u2019t want it to be you.\u201d \u201cYou won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cDid it hurt you to do this to him?\u201d she demanded softly, knowing Vishous hadn\u2019t left. \u201cTell me it hurt you.\u201d She heard a whispering of cloth. When she glanced over her shoulder, Vishous had taken off his shirt. On his muscular chest there was a fresh wound, a slice, as if a blade had cut into his skin. \u201cIt killed each one of us.\u201d ------------------------ V\u2019s diamond eyes, usually so calm, were narrow and pissed off. \u201cWhen I say I\u2019m never wrong, I\u2019m not on an ego trip.

If that\u2019s not compelling enough to get someone to pick this series up, I don\u2019t know what is. (HA!!!!) Each book focuses on the romance of one brother and the female of his destiny. In this particular book, the brother in question is Rhage. Rhage is an oversexed vampire with a dragon curse (oooh, dragons outside of a medieval mystery or epic fantasy!) Whenever he loses his temper, he turns into a dragon and kills everything in sight. Sex helps him control the dragon. Sex and fighting. Duly noted and kind of hot, so I was intrigued. Rhage\u2019s lady friend is a human woman named Mary who volunteers for a suicide hotline and also happens to be dying of leukemia. Obviously she\u2019s being set up for some kind of immortality deal. Sort of boring when you\u2019re dealing with a vampire story, in my opinion, however, I should note that in Ward\u2019s world, vampire bites do not turn humans into vampires. Vampires are born, not made. So I was also intrigued how Mary\u2019s inevitable death due to cancer could be worked into immortality if the restrictions of the world prevent her from becoming a vampire herself. ***spoilers past this point*** In addition to containing spoilers, this is the part of the review where I will complain about the things I did not like about this book and then try to pinpoint the exact reason this series has me panting for more (that shipment from booksfree.com can\u2019t get to my mailbox fast enough)! For starters, let\u2019s start with the overarching complaints that have impacted the first two books in the series and will likely extend to the rest (based on the series research I\u2019ve conducted thus far): --The heroes names are insane . And not in the good way. Wrath? Rhage? Phury? Zsadist? And in this particular installment, an adolescent vampire who dreams of the name Tehrror is introduced to the mix as well. Give me a flipping break! --\u201cShitkickers\u201d annoy the bejeebus out of me. Apparently to be a fully-fledged member of the brotherhood, one cannot wear boots, one must wear \u201cshitkickers.\u201d --The tough guy dialect shared by the brothers makes me cringe and I feel embarrassed for them whenever they talk to each other. Actually, come to think of it, the affected vernacular (it has to be affected because literally NO ONE ELSE in their world talks that way except the brothers) reminds me of people I\u2019ve met in real life who are emotionally weak and/or were picked on *horribly* as children and have adopted a tough image to overcompensate. Maybe that\u2019s not too unheard of given the fact that pre-warrior vampires are born as weak, pencil-necked geeks. But even if that\u2019s the case, the way they talk to each other annoys me. --The rap music. Um, no. Just no. The references were over-the-top and ridiculous. And they made me laugh, which I don\u2019t think was the point. The reason I did not particularly like this book was because I felt it fell apart in the middle. It started strong. It was intriguing. And then something happened that turned me off so badly that I realized I\u2019d reached the point of no return with this couple and regardless of how they worked the problem out amongst themselves, I was done with them. Despite the fact that sex supposedly calmed Rhage\u2019s dragon beast, being with Mary had the opposite effect. As he kisses her and tries to be intimate with her, he can feel the beast coming closer and closer to the surface and is reluctant to have sex with her for that reason. She doesn\u2019t know about his curse so he\u2019s scared of frightening her or hurting her and tries to prevent this from happening by backing away from her when it becomes too much to handle. At one point, he decides to go to a bar to meet a strange woman and have anonymous sex with her, which will then allow him to \u201cbe\u201d with Mary without losing control. Mary doesn\u2019t know his reasons, but she knows he leaves her in his room to go out and have sex with a stranger. I think most romance readers would be annoyed by his decision to do something like this. However, knowing there was a fairly legitimate reason for doing this bought him a small bit of leeway from me. I didn\u2019t like it, but it wasn\u2019t completely out of character. However, immediately after he returns from the bar where he admittedly has just had sex with some strange woman, she jumps his bones and they have sex for the first time. WTF??? That pissed me off BIG time. OK ladies, if your man leaves you alone in his bedroom and you know he\u2019s just gone out to have meaningless sex with an anonymous stranger, the first thing you do NOT do is share your holy of holies with him the second he returns, mmkay? After that happened, I didn\u2019t really care less about what happened to either of them. I had a hard time taking either of them seriously after that point and the fact that the last portion of the book spent more energy in setting up the next installment in the series rather than in resolving the plots within its own pages also irked me to no end. The book just sort of ended. It wasn\u2019t even on a cliffhanger. Mary\u2019s civilian vampire friend, Bella, was abducted by the evil slayers. Bella is being slated to be the destined female for Zsadist in the third installment of the series and it peeves me to no end that she was abducted in the second book and not even mentioned in the last chapter. The last chapter of <+++>Lover Eternal</+++> was a happy, sappy ending between Rhage and Mary and had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that her friend had been abducted a few chapters earlier and never rescued. Lame. ...more Opening Line: \"Ah, hell, V, you're killing me.\" LOVER ETERNAL is Rhage's story and oh man are we in for a treat. Such a perfect, heartbreaking romance.

Such a perfect, heartbreaking romance. Continuing directly after Dark Lover , we find The Black Dagger Brotherhood now living together in Darius's mansion. Wrath has stepped up to the throne with his Queen Beth by his side, as the battle with the Lessers continues. One of the things I loved about the book is that we get to know all the brother's a whole lot better here, their unique personalities along with all their quirks, fears and flaws. The constant teasing and smart ass comments are hilarious and the bond between the men instills in us a true sense of family. Rhage, as this books hero is a great character. With a boyish style of charm he's funny, sexy and fiercely loyal. Throw in the playboy model good looks and yes he's every woman's fantasy except for one small thing. Rhage has been cursed by the Scribe Virgin and now bears the mark of a dragon inside and out. The only way for him to keep the beast quiet is with violence or sex, and Rhage hates himself for it. Struggling each day to keep from harming those closest to him because once the beast gets out its so violent and unpredictable that even the Brothers fear for their lives. Mary has been fighting a curse of her own and fears that the cancer which robbed her of her looks and youth may have returned. She is, in her own words nothing special, plain and past her prime with a body battered by chemotherapy. When she befriends a young mute boy named John Mathew her life changes forever. Bella, Mary's friend and neighbour recognizes the boy as one of her own, a pre-transitioned vampire and strangely baring the mark of a warrior. Acting as John Mathew's translator, Mary finds herself at the Brotherhood mansion where she meets Rhage. He is instantly attracted to her, coming on strong although she can't understand what he sees in her. On their first date Mary assumes he's being polite and just wants to be friends but as Rhage continues to pursue her she is thrown into the world of the paranormal. For Rhage Mary is IT. Her voice soothes him and he finds her to be the most beautiful, interesting woman he's ever met, wanting her like no other before, but unfortunately his beast wants her too. After being told repeatedly to `scrub' Mary's memories and defying direct orders Rhage ultimately must pay the price for his insubordination and this is quite the scene as the Brother's are forced to perform a `rythe' (a ritual where the recipient is struck by a weapon without defending himself) However this turns out to be only the first of his many sacrifices for Mary. Rhage and Mary's love story is well done, heartbreakingly sweet but also erotic as hell. As Mary attempts to `tame' the chained beast while Butch and V stand guard. I honestly didn't know if they were going to get there HEA until the last few pages and Rhage's final meeting with the Scribe Virgin contains an absolutely heart wrenching scene that kept me gasping as I know her enjoyment of sacrifice. Throughout this story we have of course go back and forth to the Lessers who have set up a torture facility and a side plot develops which finds Bella irresistibly drawn to Zsadist. He of course pushes her away but not before allowing us a glimpse of softness within 'the cold one.' Phury warns her to leave him alone, explaining that his twin is \"ruined not broken\" but when the Lessers kidnap Bella's it's Zsadist who makes it his personal mission to find her. Setting up the premise for the next book in this fantastic series, Lover Awakened and this story is not to be missed. This series just gets better and better and if you like your paranormal romance than I can't recommend LOVER ETERNAL enough. ...more 4.6 stars \u201cI know all about you, and everything I see is beautiful.

Owned by this dark side, Rhage fears the time when his inner dragon is unleashed, making him a danger to everyone around him. Mary Luce, a survivor of many hardships is unwittingly thrown into the vampire world and reliant on Rhage's protection. With a life-threatening curse of her own, Mary is not looking for love. She lost her faith in miracles years ago. But when Rhage's intense animal attraction turns into something more emotional, he knows that he must make Mary his alone. And while their enemies close in, Mary fights desperately to gain life eternal with the one she loves... It feels so good re-reading these books. It\u2019s like coming back home after a long and exhausting day. And, boy, Rhage can make me giggle like a little girl and blush like an old horny nun and Mary, sweet Mary, she\u2019s oh so wonderful. She\u2019s such a warrior with the gentlest heart of all. Note: As always, when it comes to the BDB books, I can\u2019t be neutral even to save my life. So I\u2019ll try to keep my head straight and have my feeling in control. This second book in the Black Dagger Brotherhood world tells the story about Rhage and Mary and how they save each other in every possible way. This book also plays a main part because it leads to some of the following stories. As a sequel I can\u2019t say <+++>Lover Eternal</+++> complements the first book but it does do a very good job. Warden\u2019s writing style is always on point and sharp. Some people may find the language and the way the Brothers talk not so appealing but I like it a lot. It makes sense if you\u2019re really into the story. The same goes for the female/male thing. One thing we need to remember is that they\u2019re a different species and their ways and traditions are also different and, even when they keep up with modern tendencies, they\u2019re still animalistic. Once you get that behind, I think the books become more and more enjoyable. I sometimes skip the lessers parts, but in this book I didn\u2019t do it. One of the lessers, O, was twisted and sick as fuck. When he was human he was a monster and now, in this new life, he\u2019s such a psychopath and his quest to find a woman who looks like his dead wife it\u2019s both repulsive and interesting to read. Now, back to our MCs\u2026 Rhage is a really complex character. He has so many layers but he\u2019s always ready to be the optimistic one, the one who takes the beating for someone else, the one who makes things lighter and the one who will have everyone\u2019s back but he\u2019s in deep shit, he suffers, not only because of his curse but also for the emptiness of his actions. \u201cCould you not\u2026ride me about the females? Because the truth is, I hate it, I really do. I hate the anonymity of it. I hate the way my chest aches afterward. I hate the smells on my body and in my hair when I get home. But most of all, I hate the fact that I\u2019m going to have to do it again because if I don\u2019t, I could end up hurting one of you guys or some innocent bystander. And those two sisters you\u2019re so impressed with? See, here\u2019s the thing. I only pick the ones who don\u2019t give a shit who they\u2019re with, because otherwise it\u2019s not fair. Those two bar chippies checked out my watch and my roll and figured I was a pimp trophy. The fucking was about as intimate as a car accident. And tonight? You\u2019re going home to Wellsie. I\u2019m going home alone. Just like I did yesterday. Just like I\u2019m going to do the day after. The whoring isn\u2019t fun for me, and it\u2019s been killing me for years, so please give it a rest, dig?\u201d Only fighting and sex can calm him enough to keep the beast under control but he hates himself afterwards. And Rhage is actually so selfless despite some of his actions. He cares for his brothers a lot, he\u2019s ready to do anything for them, ready to endure any kind of torture for the sake of them, and now Mary\u2019s. His backstory is also interesting. Here we have a young man blessed with godlike looks, herculean strength, and almost endless energy, smart as they come and charming as fuck so what does he do after his transition? He\u2019s drunk on power. He fucks his way through life and abuses of his recently acquired gifts for years until he\u2019s introduced to the Brotherhood and then he kills a bird. \u201cIt was a barn owl. One of those lovely white barn owls. I can still see the red stain as its blood seeped onto its feathers. When I picked up the bird and felt its light weight in my hands, I realized that carelessness was a form of cruelty. See, I\u2019d always told myself that because I meant no harm, anything that happened wasn\u2019t my fault. At that moment, though, I knew I was wrong. If I hadn\u2019t given the female my gun, the bird wouldn\u2019t have been shot. I was responsible even though I didn\u2019t pull the trigger.\u201d That\u2019s when the Scribe Virgin curses him with the beast. \u201cShe cursed me, and since then, anytime I get out of control, the beast comes out. In a way, it\u2019s really the perfect punishment. It\u2019s taught me to regulate my energy, my moods. It\u2019s taught me to respect the consequences of all my actions. Helped me understand the power in my body in a way I never would have otherwise.\u201d It says a lot of him to see things that way now, he\u2019s grown up so much since all of that and, despite the persona he shows to everyone, he\u2019s really mature. That what makes him perfect for Mary Luce, I think. She\u2019s a survivor and a helper. She was with her mother when she got sick and died, she decides to help others and she became a therapist for autistic children and she loved her job, but then she got leukemia and almost die, though she clinically died a couple of times . She\u2019s been in remission for a couple years and she volunteers part-time on a Suicide Prevention Hotline. She doesn\u2019t take crap form anyone, she always has a smile ready and she doesn\u2019t make excuses for herself or anyone else. Of all of the things I love about Mary is the fact that she\u2019s so open to everything. She doesn\u2019t judge people that easily and when she does, she tries to vanish that feeling. She\u2019s fearless and tough and she is just so so good. And you know I usually don\u2019t like honest-to-god-good characters but Mary is legit awesome. She could not rely on him for comfort, not even in this moment. Her life depended on her keeping it together, and there was a slippery slope to tears. If she started crying now, she wasn\u2019t going to stop in the days and weeks ahead. God knew, the hard inner core of her had been the only thing that had gotten her through the last time she\u2019d been sick. If she lost that resolve, she had no power whatsoever against the disease. Mary wiped her eyes. Not again, she thought. She would not lose it in front of him again. She\u2019s fought alone for years now that having someone watch her die, like she saw her mother, that\u2019s something she can\u2019t stand. She\u2019s willing to give herself, the good parts, to people but her illness is hers only. Trusting Rhage and trusting he can handle it and love her even when she\u2019s sick is her biggest battle. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want me going through that?\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want that for either of us. I\u2019d rather you remember me the way I am now. And I\u2019d rather remember us the way we\u2019ve been. I\u2019m going to need some happy places to go.\u201d \u201cI want to be there for you.\u201d \u201cAnd I don\u2019t need that. I\u2019m not going to have the energy to put up a front. And pain\u2026pain makes people change.\u201d Once she fully understood Rhage and their feelings, she let go. It was a breaking point, to admit she was going to be worse and worse and he was going to be there for her. Both she and Rhage have their insecurities, for her was her illness and the fact that she was going to become someone she doesn\u2019t want to, and for him was the fact that he had a dangerous ugly side and how could someone see past that? How can he be worthy of someone after everything he\u2019s done? So they find in each other exactly what they\u2019re looking for and way more. Oh, and they\u2019re very sexy together. Rhage, man, he\u2019s a sensual male. He knows what he wants and how to take it and make you beg for more but his confidence and utterly devotion make him ten thousand better. And Mary? She looks so innocent and sweet but she also likes control, she loves watching him fall apart overwhelming with pleasure. She gives and she demands and she\u2019s the perfect balance to Rhage recklessness. Now, we also had some others storylines: Bella and Zsadist, John Matthew, Butch and Marissa and Phury\u2019s. I like Bella, I like her a lot. She\u2019s proper, an aristocrat woman who is reserved but she goes after what she wants. She\u2019s been taken care of her whole life and she craves for adventures, an affair with the dark side and she finds Zsadist. (view spoiler) [I\u2019M SO READY TO RE-READ THEIR BOOK OMG OMG I CAN\u2019T BREATHE (hide spoiler) ] She\u2019s attracted to him against her better judgment and she wants him, only that what she finds is a very ruined man. They\u2019re quite interesting because it\u2019s not one-sided, he wants her too but he doesn\u2019t know what to do. He was a blood and sex slave for over a century and he fears the intimacy. So, when Bella is abducted, he goes insane and deadly, ready to tear apart the world to find her. Then we have John and boy, my heart totally melted for him. He\u2019s such a tiny thing with a warrior heart. Literally. His living isn\u2019t a good one and when he\u2019s taken to the brotherhood\u2019s compound, he feels like getting back home but when Tohr takes him to his house to meet Wellsie? Guys, I sobbed. He was a lost boy and now he had a home. There are a lot of things going on and nothing at all with Butch and Marissa. He likes her, she seemed to like him back in book one but now she\u2019s avoiding him and he doesn\u2019t know what to do with that. Has he misunderstood the signals? He feels unworthy of her, she\u2019s not only a vampire but she\u2019s a precious woman in the community, as far as he knows , and she has all the right to reject his company but he\u2019s crazy about her. And then we have Phury. He seems to like Bella, but his celibacy vow is strong and he doesn\u2019t know what to do. We didn\u2019t see much of him but that\u2019ll change. Overall, this is my second favorite book in the series and it just makes me so happy.

It was so much better! Rhage is also known as \u2018Hollywood\u2019 to the other warriors of the BDB. He is the best looking of the bunch, and is with a different girl (or girls) every night. He is also the first one ready for a fight. But he has his reasons... He was cursed to live with \u2018the beast\u2019 for 200 years, and he has 91 years left to go. What people don\u2019t know about Rhage is he doesn\u2019t love using all the women, fighting all the time. It\u2019s just Rhage\u2019s story was nothing like I expected it to be... It was so much better! Rhage is also known as \u2018Hollywood\u2019 to the other warriors of the BDB. He is the best looking of the bunch, and is with a different girl (or girls) every night. He is also the first one ready for a fight. But he has his reasons... He was cursed to live with \u2018the beast\u2019 for 200 years, and he has 91 years left to go. What people don\u2019t know about Rhage is he doesn\u2019t love using all the women, fighting all the time. It\u2019s just what he has to do. Fighting and sex were the only two releases that brought him down, and he used them like a diabetic with insulin. Mary is a thirty one year old human who is a cancer survivor. She works, and voulenteers at a suicide prevention hotline. She mostly keeps busy and keeps to herself. She befriends a boy, John Matthew, who can hear, but not speak. Mary knows ASL so it works out well for the two of them. Mary\u2019s neighbor Bella comes over one night and meets John. She knows what John will be and calls the BDB. Mary comes to the BDB to act as a translator for John. There she meets Rhage. Mary knows something is different about Rhage. She also knows how good looking he is. She is just average- nothing special, but for some reason, Rhage wants her. From the first moment he hears Mary\u2019s voice, he knows. He knows she is it for him. He wants her and he will do anything he can to get her and keep her. Mary is hesitant to say the least, after she finds out her cancer is back, she doesn\u2019t want to be close to anyone, and she still can\u2019t understand why someone like Rhage would even be interested in her. But he is. And he is persistent. For the first time, Rhage wants someone, not just for sex, but to be with, to love. \u201cI know all about you, and everything I see is beautiful. Everything I see is mine.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not yours.\u201d \u201cFine. If I can't have you, then you do the taking. Have all of me, part of me, a small piece, whatever you want. Just please, have something.\u201d Rhage will do anything for Mary and to be with Mary. Even if it means defying the brotherhood. Which he does, more than once. He even has to go through a rythe from the brotherhood, which he does willingly. He would do anything to keep Mary. Rhage completely changes his ways. He wants to be different for Mary. Mary brings out the best in Rhage, but she also brings out something else. The beast. The beast wants Mary just as much as Rhage, and instead of going away like the past when he has been intimate, it comes out. Luckily, they find a way to make it work (Bruce and V chaining Rhage down... that what a scene!). The beast likes Mary, it wants her. She\u2019s the only thing that can calm it. \u201cHow can you stand to have me near you?\" \"The only thing I can't handle is your leaving.\u201d Things are good for a while. But Mary gets sicker and sicker. There is nothing Rhage can do to help her. And the war with the Lesser\u2019s is still going on, and one of them has a captured a close friend... the last 20-25% of this book was intense! Rhage and Mary\u2019s story was beautiful, heartbreaking, inspiring, and sexy! So much better than the first. Rhage broke my heart. He is not the cocky womanizer the first book displayed- he is so much more that that. I absolutely adored him! Mary\u2019s story was heart wrenching as well. She was strong- a survivor and the perfect mate for Rhage. I was more than a little emotional while reading this one. I have a feeling the next book is going to be any better (Z! Z! Z!) If that is possible. The best PNR I\u2019ve read in a long time! \u201cYou know, you were never the possessive type before.\u201d \u201cThats because I never had something I wanted to keep.\u201d ...more Warning: this one should take a while.

Ward to thank for it, yay! Because, seriously, this book? It's so packed with romantic crap that it would break even the most hardened of serial killers . When I started reading this luuurrrrrve masterpiece, I was prepared to love it. Hey you there, no fainting, ok? You did enough of that after Dark Lover happened. Time to man/woman/whatever up! You are strong! You can do this! Anyway, where was I? Oh yes. I was prepared to love this book . Belief suspended to the power of 100 and all that. Only that there is only so much I can take. I am a cold-hearted cynic after all, and attacking me with an army of fluffy bunnies and pastel-colored rainbows is guaranteed to unleash the homicidal maniac in me . In my Dark Lover review I pointed out all the things that should have made me want to throw the book across the room in complete exasperation and utter desperation, but didn't. For this book I shall therefore list all the things that should have made me want to throw the book across the room in complete exasperation and utter desperation, but didn't. Because I was reading on my Kindle and didn't want to break it in a fit of sugar shock-induced violence . \u2460 Welcome to the greatest pity party on earth! Please meet I'm-Not-Worthy-Mary and Woe-Is-Me-Rhage: she is annoying as hell, has no self-respect (more on that later) and whines 24/7. He revels in self-pity and has as much charisma as a cardboard box , which is quite ironic for a guy nicknamed Hollywood \u2190 and the award for the silliest names & nicknames ever goes to\u2026J.R. Ward! Congratulations, the winner is you! Such a delightful couple, these two. They really are a match made in heaven . \u2461 Holy Bloody Mary Mother of God . Mary, Mary, Mary. What should we do with you? You must be one of the most exasperating female characters I've ever come across. You know J.R. Ward, the whole \"I'm so ugly and boring and uninteresting and a burden and Rhage-only-wants-to-be-friends-with-me-ha-figures and why-would-Rhage-want-to-be-with-someone-like-me-when-he-can-have-the-hottest-chicks-in-the-universe\" act gets old really fast . And when I say really fast, I mean REALLY FAST. \u2709 Private message to Mary: stop thinking, start humping. Or grinding. Or whatever. You get the idea. Not only does Mary have no self-esteem whatsoever, she also has absolutely no self-respect! Isn't she a dream come true?! Get this: her mate/boyfriend/whatever (you know, the guy she's not good enough for) refuses to have sex with her (I could tell you why but [spoilers]). He goes off to have sex with some unknown chick in a bar ( he's classy like that ) \u2190 yes, people who have read this book, I know he supposedly HAS to do this (view spoiler) [personally, I would have gone and killed a few things instead, but it's his life, not mine (hide spoiler) ] but that's not the point here, so lay off me. Thank you. \u2190 Listen people, if you keep distracting me like this, we won't go anywhere. So, where were we? Oh yes. Rhage, bar, classy sex . So dear Rhage gets home after getting it on with that unknown chick (did I mention the chick was hot? J.R. Ward doesn't describe her but I'm pretty sure she was hot as hell. I mean, Rhage is a hot chick magnet so she's gotta be hot, right? Right.) Okay, okay, I'm getting there! So Rhage gets home. Mary is suitably pissed off/heartbroken and her self-esteem is shattered once again (sob sob). So far so good. What does she do next? Why she jumps his bones , of course! Because what self-respecting woman wouldn't have sex with her boyfriend/mate/whatever who just had classy sex with some unknown hot chick in a bar? Yep, self-respect is seriously overrated these days. But that's not all. Oh no. It gets much better. Because what does dear Holy Mary do next? She apologizes to You're-Too-Good-For-Me-Rhage for \"using\" and \"violating\" him. Way to go, girl. I think you'll be my role model from now on . \u2462 My ridiculous name is Rhage and my stupid nickname is Hollywood . I am at a loss for words here, J.R. Ward. So here you have this super cool character idea and the only thing you manage to do with it is turn the guy into a teary-eyed, love-sick puppy bore ? You have got to be kidding me. He should have been tough as iron nails (yes, there is such a thing). He should have been excruciatingly aggravating. He should have been a total asshole . But no, the guy is freaking nice. Yes, NICE. Seriously, J.R. Ward? Need I remind you that your character is supposed to be a freaking [BEEP] (view spoiler) [\u2190 this is a new kind of spoiler. It's specially designed to prevent self-spoiling temptation. No tag to click on, no self-spoiling temptation. Pretty neat, huh? (hide spoiler) ] ?! *shakes head in desperation* Anyway, long story short: Rhage is a pathetic crybaby , so I shall (very graciously, I might add) leave him for you ladies to fight over. The guy's infected with the deadly Sick Lurrrrve Disease (SLD) , there's no way I'm letting him into my harem. Do you seriously think I'd let him contaminate my delicious gang of truly aggravating assholes ? \u2463 The greatest cheese fest on earth You don't know what cheese is until you've read this book. J.R. Ward has bravely gone where no author had ever gone before . Let me tell you, The Duke and I is nothing compared to this . And when I say nothing, I mean NOTHING. Bloody hell. It's a miracle I'm still alive. Well, I must say I do have a weird rash all over my body right now, but I guess that's a side-effect of level 10 sugar shock poisoning (the deadliest kind). And how does this delightful utter cheesiness and total mushiness fiesta end? Why in a glorious blast of MEA (Miraculously Ever After) , of course! Because J.R. Ward doesn't do HEAs, oh no. HEAs are totally out these days. And terribly depressing , too. So when happiness no longer cuts it, what does J.R. Ward do? She throws in a freaking miracle! YES!!!! My life is now complete!!! I shall be miraculously ecstatic ever after !! Hallelujah, all my prayers have finally been answered!! \u2464 Boredom, Inc No I am not talking about my review here. You're hilarious, you know that? In Dark Lover , there was a plot. In Dark Lover, there was a story. In Dark Lover, there was world building. In Lover Eternal, there is a BIG FAT NOTHING . It's all Mary & Rhage, blah blah blah, whine whine whine. The John subplot is YAWN, the Mr O & Mr X subplot is please-someone-slap-me-I'm-falling-asleep . The little action there is is yeah-yeah-yeah-fascinating-please-get-own-with-it-thank-you-very-much. Damn, the whole thing is so desperately dull and lacklustre even the sex scenes are boring as hell . Yep, you read that right, boring sex scenes. Now that's quite an achievement right there . J.R. Ward . Sigh. To think I almost loved you when I finished reading Dark Lover. I mean, you were the person that finally managed to make me love like a Freaking PNR Novel. You, however, nipped this young PNR love in the bud , so I can't say I like you very much right now. Yes, I still plan to read Z's book. Because, you know, Z (view spoiler) [he's mine (hide spoiler) ] . But he better keep his ass in check . And you definitely better not pull a Barbara Cartland on me, J.R. Ward.

Rhage is the strongest and most beautiful member of the Black Dagger Brotherhood. He\u2019s also cursed to share his body with a beast for 200 years. Rhage stifles his beast and prevents it's appearance by fighting until exhaustion and fucking any female that isn't married or fertile. \u201cYeah, Tohr, can I ask you a favor?\u201d \u201cAnything, my brother.\u201d \u201cCould you not...ride me about the females? Because the truth is, I hate it, I really do. I hate the anonymity of it. I hate the way my chest aches afterward. I hate the smells on my body and in my hair when I get home. But most of all, I hate the fact that I\u2019m going to have to do it again because if I don\u2019t, I could end up hurting one of you guys or some innocent bystander.\u201d...\u201dAnd those two sisters you\u2019re so impressed with? See, here\u2019s the thing. I only pick the ones who don\u2019t give a shit who they\u2019re with, because otherwise it\u2019s not fair. Those two bar chippies checked out my watch and my roll and figured I was a pimp trophy. The fucking was about as intimate as a car accident. And tonight? You\u2019re going home to Wellsie. I\u2019m going home alone. Just like I did yesterday. Just like I\u2019m going to do the day after. The whoring isn\u2019t fun for me, and it\u2019s been killing me for years, so please give it a rest, dig? Rhage longs to have the same woman in his bed every night. But that isn't a possibility with his curse. At least, it wasn't, until he meets Mary. Her voice soothes him, and her scent is clean and refreshing. He's been given direct orders to scrub her memory and remove himself from her life, but he just can't bring himself to do it! It's insta-love on steroids, and I Love It!! His voice was like sandpaper. \"I need to tell you something.\" I'm a vampire. I'm a warrior. I'm a dangerous beast. At the end of this evening, you aren't going to remember you ever met me. And the idea of not even being a memory of yours makes me feel like I've been stabbed in the chest. Rhage was head over heals crazy for Mary. His insta-love for her was beyond intense and I believe it was a bit overwhelming for Rhage. I also think that Mary found it hard to believe all the sweet, endearing things Rhage proclaimed. What you just had is nothing compared to what I want to do to you. I want my head between your legs so I can lick you until you scream my name. Then I want to mount you like an animal and look into your eyes as I come inside of you. I want to to take you every way there is. I want to do you from behind. I want to screw you standing up, against the wall. I want you to sit on my hips and ride me until I can't breath. Mary is a cancer surviver. Leukemia to be exact, and she doesn't have time to waste on a date with a stud god. A man that wreaks of youth and vitality when she is facing certain death. Some saw Mary as weak and insecure. She just had more important things on her mind than entertaining a glorified sex god. Mary was guilty of judging a book by it's cover. When she looked at Rhage, all she saw was a pretty face. All it took was quality time with Rhage, to learn that he was a man of worth. \u201cI will not fall in love with you.\u201d She said. \u201cI can\u2019t let myself. I won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll love you enough for the both of us.\u201d Mary is stronger and more secure than most readers giver her credit for. Yes, she knew she wasn't 'hot', but she wasn't insecure in her own skin. She stood up to Zadist and Vishious. And when the time came, she was willing to go head to head with Rhage's Beast! I love Mary and Rhage together! He was willing to walk away from the brotherhood for her. And he made the ultimate sacrifice in order to keep her safe. Mary calmed Rhage's inner beast and provided him with comfort when he had lost hope in ever having peace! This re-read was Amazing and makes me want to pick up Zadist's book yet again!! Damn, J.R.

It was wonderful seeing how Rhage could get Mary to soften towards him. It loved getting to know his sweeter side. The ending was unbelievably good! Love this one and love this whole series!

Mary's self-deprication is over-the-top and embarrassing on her first date with Rhage, with her trying to run for the hills before the man can even introduce himself. Annoying. Once she accepts him, she gains more strength and courage. It makes her far more bearable--even likable--but it doesn't change the fact that I constantly rolled my eyes at all their drama. Around every bend was another cry of but we can't . Get over yourselves and enjoy life already. Then I cackled and shook my head every time Mary's core bloomed and she gushed all over the place. Like gysers, these women. The Chosen. Their entire existence irks me: a group of women bred to serve the Scribe Virgin, feed unmated warriors, and pop out kids. I understand the necessity of their role, but must they spout phrases like, \"I have been properly cleansed for your use. You may inspect me, should you wish...\"? All said in a mournful tone implying shame at not providing sexual service. It's offensive. Let's move on to the Brothers themselves. This is where Ward shines and where I wish she'd spend more time. (Seeing as how her women are so meh yet her men so vibrant, maybe she should give up the het and write M/M. I think she'd be better at it.) The Brothers' interactions are great. There's a sense of deep connection between them. They are there for one another no matter the circumstances. (Even the damaged, anti-social Z reaches out in his own way.) V and Butch remain favorites for their easy natures and capable attitudes. Although technically not a Brother, I loved seeing Butch settling into place and his hopes to do more for the BDB. My one big gripe with the Brothers is the illogical adoption of gangsta culture. All the \"straight up\" and \"you feel me\" doesn't ring true for any of them, with perhaps the exception of V. He's the only one who seems relatively consistent with it, while the others pepper their more formal speech with random slang--like kids trying to fit in with the cool crowd. They're hundreds of years old. These aren't speech patterns they grew up with. I oh so dearly wish it would stop. In the midst of the angst and shitkickers is a mysterious side story. This book introduces John Matthew, a scrawny kid who is destined for more. He's the kind of character who begs speculation, while also adding a thread of desperation and a new corner of the BDB universe to explore. With John Matthew's arrival and the set-up for Z's story, I can see how this series could easily move to UF. It's a change I'd welcome, since I think Ward needs to beef up her world--in particular, her antagonists. The lessers are incredibly weak as Big Bads go. Sure, they kidnap civilian vampires. But since Ward never shares their torture techniques or interrogation sessions, the threat feels remote. I know they're supposed to be dangerous slayers, but without more information they merely come off as inept redshirts. The Brothers easily shake them off and take them down. Their leader, <---C>Mr. X</---C>, does nothing but boss his underlings around and threaten them with the Omega. Who is this Omega? What's his gripe? What's he capable of other than making one dude scream? If he's so powerful and intimidating, why can't he make his forces more capable? And why do they smell like fricken baby powder?! For God's sake. The Brothers can smell them coming a mile away. Why saddle your forces with an early warning system that alerts the enemy ? Madness! Mr. O is the only villain of substance, and it's because of who he is rather than the organization he's in. He's a creepy, twisted guy with a destructive and defiant streak. He's full of calculated malice and likes getting his hands dirty. The lessers could be very different were he at the helm--they might actually get something done. Overall, the romance clich\u00e9s in Lover Eternal were painful. For me, there was no thrill in the chase. Instead there was a lot of eye-rolling and innappropriate laughter. I'd hoped the background story of the Scribe Virgin, the Omega and the lessers would be enough to pick up the slack, but Ward's world has almost zero development outside the Brothers' door. I know this is PNR and so the focus is supposed to be on the romance. But if you are going to hand me a passel of warriors and expect me to believe they are Big Strong Males fighting the Good Fight, give them a worthy foe. Give them a society worth saving. Give them a purpose outside of listening to rap, stalking women, and beating up some baby-powdered freaks. The current formula just doesn't do the trick. ...more WOW!

There\u2019s so much that can be said but has already been stated much better by others in their reviews. Here are just a few of my thoughts and feelings. Rhage - The Brothers call him Hollywood. Towering well over six feet eight, stronger than all the other warriors, all hard well endowed muscle, this vampire is flat-out drop-dead gorgeous! Pure - Walking- Desire! A sex legend in the vampire world. Women are attracted to him like bees on honey. He walks into a room and their eyes devour him, follow him, and it\u2019s easy to understand why they would \u201ctrample their own young to get him.\" But he isn\u2019t just another pretty face. He lives with a curse and the only way to keep it in line is through fighting and sex. As his story unfolds, you get to see the real man with all the emotional despair, his unhappiness and his unfulfilled desires. And while strong and deadly, the tenderness he has for Mary is beyond description! It\u2019s been said that if \u201csex were food, Rhage would have been morbidly obese.\u201d I came into book two thinking Rhage more a player. I quickly found this not to be true and this tormented warrior completely won my heart! His unselfish love for Mary is one of the most touching I've read. Mary - I so admired this heroine! A warrior for sure in her own way. She has fought a hard battle and has the scars of proof scattering around her body. There are so many things I liked about Mary. She is compassionate and caring, going above and beyond to help someone in need. What I liked the most about her is how she stepped up for Rhage, going deep inside to his pain and her fight for him. Throughout most of the book I could not see how this could have a happy ending. My heart nearly stopped in chapter 50! I held my breath and nearly shouted from relief in the next chapter! There are so many things I liked about Rhage and Mary\u2019s story. I love intense alpha warriors and Rhage certainly is all that and more. One of the best and most tender love scenes I\u2019ve ever read is Rhage and Mary\u2019s first time together. Her despair and his tenderness were palpable. If possible, I think I enjoyed this book more than the first. This was a darker read that kept my emotions all over the place! I also got a better glimpse into the amazing talent of this author. She took me into the world of two very lonely people, both suffering deeply, and created an amazing tender, poignant love story. Added to this I learned more about the other brothers, was introduced to new characters and left me with an intense desire to immediately begin the next installment. With that, I\u2019m now on to book #3, Zsadist and Bella\u2019s story!:) [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more Oh man.

What I also loved was the fact that Mary was a little hesistant with Rhage. She didn't just fall into his arms because of his looks and reputation. She is a smart woman who sticks to the truth about life, which is that it only happens once. With her health on the line, Mary takes cautious steps in this book where she learns to trust and love someone else. Mary and Rhage just may be my favourite couple of the BDB so far. Their love was believeable and if put in the same position as Rhage was, I think I would make the same decision he did. Thank the Virgin Scribe for her compassionate heart, that's all I have to say. This book is truly a happily ever after, and it couldn't have happened to a better couple. Favourite Quote: Butch came around in front, twisting his shirt he'd taken off into a rope. Thanks to all the lifting they'd been doing, the male's chest and arm muscles were thickening up, and he hadn't been small to begin with. He couldn't pull the kind of iron Rhage did, but for a human, the guy was a bulldozer. \"You're getting into some kind of shape, cop.\" \"Aw come on now.\" Butch grinned. \"Don't let that shower we took go to your head.\" p. 117, ...more I am really kinda speechless after reading this book. Saying that I LOVED IT is kinda putting it mildly. Honestly, the other paranormal books I have read in the past few months have paled in comparison to these books so far. What makes it so different is the camaraderie between the Brothers and the heroes themselves are so unique in their own way. Rhage is such a womanizer. I really didn't know if I would like him or not. But, as the storyline progressed and his true nature starts to reveal itsel I am really kinda speechless after reading this book.

He definately rates top 5 easily. For such a bad-ass, he was so tender and loving with Mary. His sacrifice at the end for her was amazing. I loved him. He is worthy of a happily ever after. Mary is another really well written heroine. I really liked her. I felt her insecurities, her hope that she may get better and the love she had for Rhage and the beast within him. Get your tissues out girls because I cried in this book. When Mary finally breaks down in front of Rhage, I literally had to put the book down and wipe my eyes for several minutes. It's not all sadness and tears. It has some very funny moments in it. It is just the total package all around. Gosh between Wrath and Rhage I don't know which one I liked the best.

She was constantly pushing Rhage away and he didn't even deserve it (well, maybe once or twice). She was hurting him and because i love my darling Rhage so much, i wanted to hurt her too (which isn't a good thing). But then she got a bit better, and i felt more connected to her. I liked her more. Rhage.., (Like i said before) i absolutely ADORED him. He was such a caring sweetheart , and i don't think anyone can NOT love him. But what he did (view spoiler) [when he went away after he lost control of his beast when he nearly had sex with Mary, to find some other woman to have sex with instead? Was. Horrendous! I actually did not believe he did it!!! I kept making up excuses even when he admitted it to her.Even though that screamed 'cheater' at me, i still loved him. (hide spoiler) ] I was like... I don't think it even fully sank in yet. What i loved? (let's make a list, shall we?). - The writing style , which always captivates my imagination. - The characters , which feel very realistic - The brotherhood , which is as usual full of hotties and guys who support each other. One word - beautiful. - Getting sneak peaks on my fav and beloved Zsadist with Bella. - How simply exciting the book makes me The most awesome thing was that the sex scenes weren't cut off right when they were about to do it (which was annoying the SHIT OUTTA me in book 1). Lover Eternal was definitely much hotter from the previous book... \"Oh yeah, Mary. That's right.\" He rubbed her and she gripped his thick biceps, her head falling back. \"God, you're burning alive. Are you wet for me Mary? I think you are. I think you're covered in honey...\" ********************* \"I want my head between your legs so I can lick you until you scream my name. Then I want to mount you like an animal and look into your eyes as I come inside you. And after that? I want to take you every way there is.\" The Ending I was literally having a panic attack or something thinking about the massive probability Mary and Rhage won't end up together. This is me the moment ... (view spoiler) [The Scribe Virgin tells Rhage the sacrifice will be loosing any contact whats so ever with Mary, and that her memories will be cleaned of everyone. (hide spoiler) ] I. Started. Crying. Now coming from me that's saying something because i never cry reading books or watching movies ( that REALLY rarely happens). But because i cared so much for the MC and wanted them to have a HEA, i did cry. My beautiful and breathtaking Zsadist is next! Come to mama, baby! (His story better be THE BEST!). Overall.

I seldom skim pages, but whenever there was a lesser talking, I just had to skip pages. Plus, I felt that the H/h were jumping on each other. I barely liked the romance, so the one star. Oh, please let me hav I have a confession to make\u2026 But please don\u2019t throw rotten tomatoes at me! PLEASE! *in a tiny tiny voice* I *gulp* seriously gave Dark Lover , the first book in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series, umm, one star. *run and cower for cover* I think I have a logical explanation on the one star. I seldom skim pages, but whenever there was a lesser talking, I just had to skip pages. Plus, I felt that the H/h were jumping on each other. I barely liked the romance, so the one star. Oh, please let me have friends left, after this review. But now, after contemplating that I am abnormal since after the 12,552 people who rated Dark Lover , I go straight to the 1% who didn\u2019t like it. So that makes me abnormal . However, I don\u2019t like being abnormal. I want to be normal. So I gave Lover Eternal a chance, since it means that I am giving a chance to jump on the hype and be \u201cnormal\u201d. So, I pre-programmed my head that \u201cI would like this\u201d again and again. I really thought that hard. But flipping through the pages, it became easy, and I didn\u2019t need the chant anymore. I was seriously liking what I was reading. That is what the power of thought can do. Oh heck! I admit, I also have to give praise to J.R. Ward for writing this splendidly. And seriously, my apologies for not liking the first book of the series. I am considering a re-read soon. This book, I truly enjoyed. Rhage is not just smoking hot, but he\u2019s sweet and dedicated as well. Hmm, but why did I not give this book five stars? (1) The ending was just too good to be true. I know that this is a paranormal romance, but can\u2019t we have a happy ending without \u2018literal\u2019 magic. (2) The spelling of the warriors are messed up for me, and I seriously think it wuold affhect my spehlling skhills frhom now ohn. (3) And the names of the lessers. What happens when there are more than 24 lessers introduced? What would she call them then? A1? B2? (4) My brother. It felt too redundant to me. But why did I seriously like it? (1)I love the romance aspect of the book. Quick plot details ahead. Well, Rhage has been cursed by the Scribe Virgin. He could turn to a savage beast when he feels pain or any intense emotion. He needs an outlet, which are violence and sex. Well, that was until he met Mary Luce. Her voice could calm the beast inside him. He falls for her, and what I love is, he\u2019s not ashamed to admit it. But the thing is, Mary is sick. But they work that out. (2) The bond between the brothers are cute. (3)Rhage is so *sigh*. (4)Bella and Zsadist are also a thing to look out for. Well, definitely I\u2019m amending my first opinions, recommending this to all paranormal romance readers and seriously hoping that my friends don\u2019t hate me. ...more Lover Eternal is the second book in J. R. Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood series. To me, it is more focused on the romance and the relationship of the hero and heroine than the first book, Dark Lover .

There are so many things I loved about Rhage and Mary\u2019 Lover Eternal is the second book in J. R. Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood series.

I really liked this, as I felt it gives the reader a much better feel for the main characters than in Dark Lover . Although, I do understand that there was a lot of world-building that needed to take place in the first installment of this series. There are so many things I loved about Rhage and Mary\u2019s story. I love intense alpha males/vampires/warriors ( you pick \u2013 all yummy to me! ) and Rhage certainly lived up to this label. In Lover Eternal , Ward takes the reader into the world of two very lonely people, both suffering deeply, and created an amazingly tender and poignant love story. Added to this, I loved that we got more of a glimpse into Z\u2019s mind. Yes, I will be starting his book immediately!!!! One thing to note is that I'm so not into the Scribe Virgin, the vampire's goddess figure. She is too overbearing and bitchy for my taste. She seems to keep further tormenting the brothers rather than aiding them, even though she claims to love them. I just don\u2019t get it. I needed to get that out there. My opinion about her may change; however, right now she is not in my good graces! Bitch!!! While the plot of Lover Eternal could have been a little tighter by reducing the many conflicts and shoring up details, I found it to be generally intriguing with lots of potential for future stories. I am definitely drawn into the world of the Black Dagger Brotherhood and, as I mentioned already, I am already thoroughly invested in Zsadist and Bella and will be continuing on with the third book right about now..... ...more This definitely gets five stars this time around. JR Ward wrote her own version of beauty and the beast but with some important changes. The beauty is the beast and the heroine is a 'Plain Jane' in her own eyes. I loved how hard Rhage fell for Mary.

Mary didn't want to believe that she could have a man who loved her that way, not with all the loss in her past, and the loss sure This definitely gets five stars this time around.

Mary didn't want to believe that she could have a man who loved her that way, not with all the loss in her past, and the loss sure to come. She didn't know how to live in the day. Rhage had learned the hard way to temper himself and to show self-control, and along comes the one female who makes that even harder than it's ever been. The Beast itself was such an interesting idea to the story, and risky. I mean, you don't think of that outside of high fantasy, but it's such an integral part of Rhage's story and the way it's written sells itself. I love the Brotherhood books, always will, and it was such a treat to go back and revisit one of the early stories. I didn't really have time for a reread, but I had to do it, and boy and I am glad I did. I will end up rereading through Lover Mine, I think. Not a hardship for me, since I love those books. It was so much fun going back and seeing how the original brothers: Wrath, Rhage, Vishous, Tohr, Phury and Zsadist expand their circle. Zsadist as before got my attention and stole my heart and had me on a high as I saw the genesis of his story and where it goes (he stole the book away from poor Rhage the first go around, to be honest). Butch makes me sigh (what a guy), Vishous is so fascinating and has this wow factor, and Phury, oh my darling Phury. And let's not even talk about how much I love John Matthew. Okay, let's. I adore him so much. My heart was breaking for JM as an abandoned pre-trans. I wanted to hug him so bad. I'm glad he found the Brotherhood. My heart is wrenched thinking about all the anguish he is soon to face, but happy that he will find his mate in future books as well. I realize how much I under-appreciated Rhage. He really is a lovely guy (on the inside). What he was in the past, he's learned the hard way, wasn't the best he could be, so when Mary comes along, he grabs at her with both hands (even though he has logical fears that his curse could hurt her and keeps a distance as much as he can). Mary, wow, what a woman. What she's gone through. First nursing her dying mother, and then herself facing an illness that robbed her of so much, even her hope and faith. When Rhage comes along, she doesn't have anything left to believe that a gorgeous guy like that could want to be with her. I had forgotten how low her confidence was in her appearance. It was hurtful to see that, but the fact that Rhage was all about her (she was it for him, sigh) really compensates for that. I can certainly understand. While most of us aren't ugly, we'd think we were on a Candid Camera show if a gorgeous guy like Rhage showed up and was intensely interested in us too. Let's be honest. So the fact that she pushes him away for a significant part of the book I felt was understandable. The Lesser storyline has not ever been my favorite, but it feels more solid than it does later on in the series, more thought-provoking. While not my choice of villain, it works for this story. It is the bane of the vampire species and the reason why the Brotherhood exists. I can see that these characters are real for Ward. Because she believes in them, they feel so real to me. I loved the thoughtful way she has written this story, with a lot of pop culture, but deep true things about humanity and the feelings that are universal to the human existence. Who would have thought that a story about vampires and other so-called mythical things could be so authentic. They are treasured characters to people who consider themselves Black Dagger Brotherhood fans, flaws and all. I feel like I've gone through a family album with this reread. ...more This is my second time reading this, and while I did skim through the Lessers sections, I am keeping my original rating.

Mary did have a legitimate reason for her low self-esteem and doubts. And Rhage had good reasons for the way he acted before meeting Mary too. I am much more lenient for some reason with PNR compared to regular romances and this one still works for me. I might add more later, but this is still a favorite old-school PNR comfort read for me! :) Original post: While I wait... and wait... and wait... for my re-read of Dark Lover with Sarah (who will probably hate it) and the MacHalo group on October 22, 2015, I've decided to re-read Rhage's book.

She was nice - even too nice sometimes - but I didn't connect with her. Maybe that was intentional on my part, because I had a hard time reading about her dealing with her leukemia and I ended up skimming through most the scenes where that subject came up. As for her easy acceptance of Rhage's beast, it was unbelievable. Okay, she went through a lot since she'd met Rhage and the Brotherhood, but only a lunatic would pet a spitting-mad dragon. But she truly loved Rhage, so I guess that was okay. Regarding the overall story, the UF vibe that I first felt in Dark Lover was present in this book too, and it's starting to bother me. I just don't care about following too many storylines at the same time. I know all that stuff will lead to something important in future books but, by the time I read the next books in the series, I won't remember most of it. Rhage and Mary's love story was beautiful though, and that's what really matters to me. :) [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more 5 Big PNR Stars - Loved it all - Why stop this fantastic BDB train?

It feels so very well made, well thought out and it just gets hotter and slightly more sophisticated and naughty all the time. This will be a fantastic journey through the books. The second book, about the movie star beautiful Rhage , beginning shortly after the Brotherhood has moved out of town to a big mansion. The safety devices are now gigantic to protect them against the enemy, from The Lessening Society . The evil Omega has created these for all vampires so dangerous, slayer lesser s. At night it's the guys in The Black Dagger Brotherhood's task to kill as many of them as possible to protect all of the king Wrath's (book #1) vampires. Rhage loves to hunt lessers, he is an excellent killer ....and sadly also a not so nice \u201cwomen screwer\u201d . It's soulless and impersonal but it relieves his inner pressure. The constant pressure from the cruel beast in there - the punishment for his sins. Then a day encounter the quite lovesick Rhage a human woman he can not resist. Her voice soothes his Beast and she enchants him - he wants her. It begins with a short meeting followed by a date. \u201cKeep talking,\u201d he said in her ear. God, she smelled good. Clean. Fresh. Like lemon. When she pushed against him, he leaned his full weight into her. Her breath came out in a rush. \u201cPlease,\u201d he murmured. Her chest moved against his as if she were inhaling. \u201cI... er, I have nothing to say. Except get off of me.\u201d Mary is a pretty ordinary nice thirty-year old girl . She's had a tough life with a serious illness and a rapidly shrinking family. That a tall, stunning handsome, blond guy like Rhage could feel attraction and want a woman like her, she simply doesn't belive and understand. \u2018Still, it would have been great, just once, to have a man stare at her with total adoration. To have him be... enthralled. Yes, that was the word. She would have loved for a man to be enthralled by her.\u2019 ... And perhaps that is the theme for this story: The daring to believe in true and grand love , to be open and honest and to listen to what the other partner is actually saying. It was up and down and back and forth and all the time there was the threat of death... But soooo lovely and romantic - this was an amazing beautiful and emotional story about Rhage and Mary. I suffered with them, I was happy with them and I wanted them both all the earth's happiness. I don't want to reveal too much, but sometimes was Rhage too much of the old bitter male-whore again and sometimes was Mary a whiny and annoying heroine - but now is everything forgotten and forgiven. In between it was awkward and tedious and sometimes I wondered if happiness and a HEA was possible after all that happened. We'll see weaknesses and what are good romance without any weakness in the hero himself - nothing. \u2018Being with Mary was different because...he wasn't the only one who wanted to make love to her. The beast wanted her, too. The beast wanted out so it could take her.\u2019 There were some really steamy hot scenes (yes, all of you who have already met them know what I'm talking about) and I really felt the chemistry between them. Sure was the nasty Beast quite disgusting and ugly but everything will work out in the fairytale world. Even i this one! The finish was perhaps too quickly after so many pages, but she got the prince. ~ I'm happy and I got a tender and lovely romance. ~ ... And the others, all brothers of the Black Dagger Brotherhood, these charming guys and strong warrior vampires ~ There is so much to tell... I hate all the enemies, injustices and cruelties in this world. I don't even want to think about what the enemy is doing with the poor civilian vampires who are captured. The leader, Mr. X is a terrible psychopath and I really, really hope that the brave Brotherhood may kill him really soon. The suspense parts were really good even in this second book - but creeping creepy. ...but god damn fun to read about. It's steaming hot and so much fun to meet all these guys. I look very much forward to getting everyone's love stories. I just feel so great tenderness for these weak, so lovesick vampires brothers with their damaged hearts. Oh, these brothers, they all need a warm embrace of a very strong loving woman. - Yes, it's true. A woman in her prime, like me, believe now, in all seriousness, that all this is deadly serious. - The Brotherhood need more nice lovesick women and I'd love to take the chance. \u2018The rejection didn't faze him. \"Fine. If I can't have you, then you do the taking. Have all of me, part of me, a small piece, whatever you want. Just please, have something.\u201d Yum! They are all promising alpha heroes, kind of larger-than-life heroes but in the same time so incredible cute and heartbreaking gorgeous. I just love them! \u201cYou know, Mary, I deserve this. I really do. I've done the same thing to so many, just walked away without giving a shit.\u201d (...) \u201cAlthough the females I screwed were lucky. At least they never remembered me. And man, I'd kill to forget about you right now, I really would.\u201d It's probably the mix of amazing heroes , romantic old-fashioned romance, light and moderately sexy erotic, good well written suspense, nice mala friend-ship, all the joking and fun spirit and also the construction of an interesting paranormal world that makes this so good and worth reading.

She lives alone and cares deeply for her neighbor Bella. She has befriended a young man ,named John, that she met form the suicide hotline. However, Mary's life is far from perfect, she has cancer. \"She\u2019d realized there was no quota on misery for people, no quantifiable threshold that once reached, got you miraculously taken out of the distress pool.\" Bella (Mary's neighbor) recognizes John as a boy on the brink of transforming into a vampire. She calls the brotherhood for help. However, John is mute. Because of her ability to sign, Mary is brought in to the brotherhood mansion as a translator. While at the mansion, Rhage sees her and falls for her. \"The effect she had on him was druglike, a tantalizing combination of sexual need and profound ease. Like he was having an orgasm and falling into a peaceful sleep at the same time. It was like nothing he\u2019d ever felt before. A chill shot through him, sucking the warmth out of his body.\" As soon as Rhage wipes her memories, he is back on high pursuit of her! He decides to see her again and again! Unfortunately, they get caught up with some lessers and Mary's life is now in danger. Now that Rhage has Mary right where he wants her (in his care, bed, and home), he is happy to care for her. Mary is one tough chick. She finds out who Rhage is and she takes it just like a spoon full of sugar straight out of a Disney movie! Her strength never ceased to amaze me. She is undoubtedly falling for Rhage but she is so insecure about herself. Also, she knows she is going to be facing the battle of her life. \u201cI will not fall in love with you,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t let myself.

It\u2019s pretty insane actually. Anyways, I did like the character of Mary, I just don\u2019t really get the romance of this book. Rhage basically insta-loves Mary\u2019s voice when they first meet and then he single mindedly pursues her, UNTIL he gets her, and then he pushes her away. I know that there are reasons for this behaviour but I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s done especially well. I also don\u2019t care for the fact that Rhage is basically taking advantage of a woman he knows is very sick just because her voice calms his inner beastman. DO NOT LIKE AT ALL. However Mary, I really like this female. I like that she seems to be aware of the world and how it works without seeming like she knows too much for realism. I like that she is a physically flawed female character. Incidentally, I also like that Rhage doesn\u2019t make a big deal about her scarring other than to be upset that she has been, and is, sick. I also like that he refers to her as a warrior for what she\u2019s gone through. I can\u2019t imagine there is a much higher compliment from one of the brotherhood. Overall, I like this story, it just won\u2019t ever be a favourite of mine. Part of that likely has to do with the fact that I think the end of their love story is a cop out, and one I especially don\u2019t care for. ...more I've pretty much felt the same way about this book as the first one, Dark Lover , just that it would be about Rhage and Mary.

Fake-it-until-you-make-it was more than psychobabble bullshit. What I loved: J.R. Ward's character progression tactics are freaking phenomenal! She's made sure that I have a vested interest in all of the brothers (and butch), and she even got me interested in the two new characters, Bella and John (especially little John) . But it doesn't stop there! I never thought I'd see any lessers creepier than the sadistic Mr. X, but Mr. O is 100% off-the-rails bug-fuck crazy. And that's what's so entertaining about J.R. Ward's writing: I really don't like this guy, but I really love seeing his twisted, deranged point of view! Which I suppose we'll get to see a lot more of in Lover Awakened . Learning more about Rhage's curse was awesome, as well as seeing a bit more into the trials and tribulations of Vishous and Zsadist. I loved watching Mary's interaction with the Beast, she managed to prove over and over how much of a badass she was under all that awkwardness she showed at the beginning. Alright... Truth time, gather 'round... (view spoiler) [I'm not saying I cried *clears throat* when Rhage offered to give up Mary so that she would survive *deep breath* I'm just saying that the pages might have blurred for a minute and I had to put the book down until I got myself together... But I was totally cool about it had my heart broken by a book for a second. (hide spoiler) ] Some of my favorite moments: (view spoiler) [ The son of a bitch actually bent the laws of physics, he was so attractive. The guy was a sex god, an erotic legend in his race. V had said that stories about Rhage were passed from father to son when the time was right. The idea that he'd downshift into being someone's husband was absurd. White trash had a way of finding their graves. Along with wife beating and beer sucking, dying was probably their only other core competency. \"You are a manipulator.\" \"I like to think of myself more as an outcome engineer.\" Sometimes, pretending to be normal was the very best antidote to weirdness. Fake-it-until-you-make-it was more than psychobabble bullshit. \"God, spare me from heroes,\" she muttered. \"Back the fuck off!\" The beast was beautiful, she thought. Beautiful in the way a cobra was, its ugliness overshadowed by graceful, shifting movements and a predatory intelligence you had to respect. (hide spoiler) ] FINAL THOUGHTS: It was amazing. Read it.
