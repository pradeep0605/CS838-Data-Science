How to Win the National Book Award for Dummies! Denis Johnson has pulled heavily from this publication for his novel <+++>Tree of Smoke</+++> . Let's highlight the recommendations he used to win the Book Award for fiction. #3. Explore a topic of great controversy for the country and its people. Johnson : the Vietnam War. #6. Story must be sweeping, at least 500 pages. Johnson : 614. #7. Include at least 5 main characters with individual story threads. Johnson : 8. 7.a. Threads should intertwine but not entirely. Johnson : Check. 7.b. A few threads should be independent entirely. Johnson : 6. 7.c. Some characters should be related. Johnson : Father and son. 7.d. Characters should be male and female. Johnson : One female. 7.f. One character should suffer a breakdown. Johnson : Yep, a crazy one who thinks himself a pagan god. 7.j. One character should be hung. Johnson : Check. 7.k. Character can be foreign. Johnson : One. #8. Story should span several years. Johnson : Takes place from 1963-1983. #11. Use realistic, pejorative language--with plenty of slang and local color and colloquialisms. Johnson : Military jargon. #12. Some characters should fall in love (and the other character shouldn't find out until years later by receiving letters from death row in Malaysia, but five years after being hung at the gallows, being caught for running guns). Johnson : Followed to a 'T.' #17. If appropriate to story, use substantial violence. Johnson : Check. #19. Include scenes of sexual relations. Johnson : Check. #20. Some characters must die. Johnson : Check, check, check. #23. Include many breaks within your chapters; pace yourself. Johnson : At least 20 breaks in all Chapters. #33. Chapters should remain untitled, or labelled with minimal reference to story. Johnson : Chapters labelled by dates only. #34. Story should include a written letter. Johnson : 15+. Advanced Techniques #37. Story can be crazy, twisted, and leave the reader feeling like they smoked a water bong. Johnson : Used to great extent. #44. Story can actually make no sense at all, as long as it seems like it's going somewhere. Johnson : Check. 44.b. As a cover for the story going nowhere, and if it's a story about the Vietnam War, you can use as subject matter a thread about Psychological Operations--that way the story can be written as an outgrowth of the zany and clandestine techniques used by the PsyOps soldiers. Johnson : Right on. 44.e. The book could be written so that the reader can remove any 5 pages at random and reinsert them at a different place in the book, and it would make absolutely no difference to the story overall. (Remember, this is an advanced technique) Johnson : Really, you can do that? I'll overexert myself with this one. #46. Some of the characters can be unlikeable. Johnson : All of them #49. Reader should be able to get all the way to page 595, then take a week break and throw up a little in his mouth to read the last 19 pages. This technique provides angst, uncertainty, and a palpable sense of dread in the reader. Johnson : Okay. Super Advanced Techniques #55. Bewilder the critics with writing that seems novel, insightful, ageless,<---M> and emotive</---M>, when in reality the writing is: 55.a. Boring. 55.b. Uninspired. 55.c. Overworked. 55.d. Unaffective. 55.e. Especially disorganized, discordant, and disagreeable. Johnson : Agree with all. FOR ME, this was a waste of 614 pages worth of reading time that I could have spent more favorably on a 2- or even 3-star book. Halfway through the book, I couldn't distinguish between several of the characters. This book was a battle of wills, not a battle of wits--who can outlast the other, reader vs writer. It's an extremely forgetful book. Look at the numbers on Goodreads. Out of 3.5 million members only 2100 people have read it. This is what happens when critics--and their oversized need to be first to herald a novel--read books instead of you or me. I'm done with this review. I'm at a loss.....just don't read it. ...more From this book I learned to carefully check materials before checking them out of my local library.

I flung it away, but it made me gag. Anyway, I enjoyed the book, but the whole time reading it I was wary of finding any additional surprises. Thankfully, there were none. This is a story about the Vietnam War told in chapters titled with the years 1963 through 1970. The last chapter takes place in 1983. One of my favorite passages was as follows, and I think it rings true for many places in our world today: \"They were born into a land at war. Born into a time of trial that never ends. What I don't think has been talked about is the fact that in order to be Hell, the people in Hell could never be sure they were really there. If God told them they were in Hell, then the torment of uncertainty would be relieved from them, and their torment wouldn't be complete without that nagging question - \"Is this suffering I see all around me my eternal damnation and the eternal damnation of all these souls, or is it just a temporary journey?\" A temporary journey in the fallen world.\" ...more I am not reviewing this book, as I consider myself to be utterly unqualified and am not sufficiently infatuated with my own sense of taste.

I liked it. A lot. Hence the stars. There. What I'm really delighting in right now, however, is how thoroughly unqualified B.R. Myers proved himself to be as well. His Atlantic Monthly review (found at: my link text ) of \"Tree of Smoke\" is a display of such blind zealotry that I can't decide between crying out for him to be publicly horsewhipped and merely laughing my ass off. But I am struggling to be humane. Being a critic, Mr. Myers is not troubled by such concerns. He is unremittingly cruel, and clearly shocked at the rest of the world's (and most especially, as will be seen, Philip Roth's) refusal to follow suit. His complaints about Johnson's prose amount to little more than petulant squealing against impressionism in literature, with every example given being backed up either by his glaring misinterpretations of the text, or simply not at all. Because it's so obvious, you see. Yes. His status as one who has long ago vanished up his own asshole is most glaringly confirmed in his declarations concerning what people can and can not feel. For the sake of space I'll ignore his charming notion that eighteen-year-old soldiers do not behave irrationally \"during a sudden and intense firefight\" (and not just \"a\", Mr. Myers, but the lad's very first), or address the questionable ethics behind his constant ignoring of any sort of context. (I'm in danger of committing some of his crimes here, I know--please be patient.) Myers apparently considers the limiting of variety in human experience a proof of how very far-reaching is his wisdom in all things literary. From the aforementioned implication as to the inability of American youths to have strayed beyond a certain range of behavior during their time in tropical Vietnam, to the impossibility of deranged persons being anything other than blind to all of human nature--with a gem somewhere in the middle as to every living male's being incapable of describing their respective genitalia in terms not centered around massiveness--it was difficult to resist the notion that, if pressed, Myers could count off the differences that are manifested in humanity with the aid of his digits, and without having to take off more than one of his oxfords. And woe unto the unsuspecting hack who should dare to claim otherwise! And further woe unto the nation that supports such hackdom, for that nation shall summon forth no other than George W. Bush to punish it for such despicable ignorance! That's right, my friends: G-dub himself is our karmic retribution for our abominable literary taste! I quote, because it's just too lovely to avoid: \"It would be foolish to demand another Tolstoy, but shouldn\u2019t we expect someone writing about the Vietnam War to have more sense and eloquence than the politicians who prosecuted it? Those two qualities are linked. There can be no deep thought without the proper use of words, as our current president never fails to demonstrate. This is why it is dangerous to hold up bad English as good[punctuation missing]and why Philip Roth should know better than to announce that Johnson writes 'prose of amazing power and stylishness.' There are people who will take that seriously... The 'application of word to thing' has been rotting for some time now, and in the very terms described. The social and political consequences are all around us. Literati who contribute to the rot[punctuation missing]whether to preserve a writer\u2019s reputation, to stimulate the book market, or simply to go with the flow[punctuation missing]have no right to complain about incoherent government.\" I shit you not. The man's nuts, a total whack-job. He shames barrels of monkeys. In truth, I can find no more convincing praise for Denis Johnson's fine work than the spastic ravings of such a one as B.R. Myers; had I come across this review beforehand, I would have scooped up \"Tree of Smoke\" immediately and filled myself up with the poetry and humanity the novel is so rich with, if for no other reason than to make of myself one more harbinger of that inept critic's personal Apocalypse. At this late date, all I can do is embrace my role as a \"Tree of Smoke\" supporter, and from this become the catalyst for every instance of political misfortune and artistic dissolution that Myers can imagine. This I do unabashedly and with great joy. [note: Lest I be accused of pettiness, I should state that I more than suspect the points of missing punctuation that run rampantly through his review to be a fault related to the website. They are, unfortunately, still there, and I've no paper copy available to aid me in their correction. They're probably hyphens.] ...more Tree of Smoke: The Lords of Fear & Discord 'Tree of Smoke' -- the title could be a metaphor for Johnson's accomplishment with this novel; if the 'smoke' is the stylistic mastery of prose he's always possessed, the 'tree' would be the solid, organic story at the novels core. He's always had more substance behind his narrative than some of the other great American stylists, like Don Delillo; but ToS is far more rich in character and plot than anything he's written before. The naysayers can go Tree of Smoke: The Lords of Fear & Discord 'Tree of Smoke' -- the title could be a metaphor for Johnson's accomplishment with this novel; if the 'smoke' is the stylistic mastery of prose he's always possessed, the 'tree' would be the solid, organic story at the novels core. He's always had more substance behind his narrative than some of the other great American stylists, like Don Delillo; but ToS is far more rich in character and plot than anything he's written before. The naysayers can go fuck themselves :-). This novel deserved the National Book Award more than any novel written in the past decade. Denis Johnson has given convincing evidence of his utter mastery of prose with 'Jesus Son', his collection of inter-connected stories about a young man drifting across the American landscape, ravaged by various addictions and accumulating tragedies. 'Already Dead', 'Angels', 'Resuscitation of a Hanged Man', 'The Stars At Noon'... Every one of these titles feature writing that is effortlessly poetic, but never pretentious or arrogant -- the trap that several great writers have been unable to avoid. The novels of Don Delillo, for example (since I've already started picking on him), are marred by his swaggering, 'I'm a fucking genius super-writer' attitude. Denis Johnson, looking smug about the National Book Award ;-). \"I'm a literary icon. I only hang out in front of buildings that match my shirt.\" I should take a star for that shit: Even the greatest writing needs a plot that pulls the reader along, a framework of characters and motivations to build the story up. While Don Delillo remains one of the English languages' foremost stylists, along with Michael Ondaatje, Charles Frazier, Cormac McCarthy and Ron Hansen, Johnson is both a natural stylist and a natural storyteller. He is a rare breed of writer, and only McCarthy displays those same preternatural gifts. In Tree of Smoke, Johnson has created an masterpiece of historical fiction, a brilliant and complex tale of the CIA's involvement in Southeast Asia and Vietnam in the years leading up to the war. It follows Bobby 'Skip' Sands, fresh out of an intensive training regime that taught him the language and cultural understanding he would need on his vague assignment. He finds it difficult to make sense of his work for 'The Colonel' -- also his uncle, a charismatic and gregarious man that Sands has little in common with. The Colonel has a great deal of blood on his hands, and some radical ideas about using psychological warfare to demoralize the enemy. His patriotism is like a weight that is crushing his soul; he has a maudlin sentimentality when he starts drinking, but as gets drunker his rambling takes on an ugly, nihilistic tone. As Skip begins to worry about the Tree of Smoke -- a massive collection of cards containing names, places, dates, religious beliefs, superstitions, indigenous flora and fauna, local foods, tribal medicines, political leanings, etc, which he is tasked with categorizing and cross-referencing into a pre-digital intelligence database -- he is warned by a peer to distance himself from his uncle, due to some mysterious proposal that has his superiors questioning his mental fitness. Oooo, a fancy diagram! No I have not given you any reason to care about the details it contains. But... it's topical and it looks all serious and shit. Look out! He's got diagrams and he's prepared to use them! Sands feels himself more isolated than ever, but finds some solace in a sad affair with a Canadian relief worker whose husband disappeared in the jungle, likely the victim of any one of the many human predators who hunt there. It also tells the story from another side, that of the Houston brothers, who left the desolate future they saw for themselves in exchange for a senseless nightmare. Their experiences are woven into the larger tale initially as anecdotal digressions, as one brother leaves his small, impoverished hometown and makes glancing contact with the Colonel and Sands. Then the younger brother finds his way to the hell that is simmering in Southeast Asia, becoming more directly entangled in the madness that has already taken root in the heart of the CIA and PsyOps. Johnson found in ToS the story that will establish him as one of the great English-language writers. Regardless what's said about it on Goodreads, where it currently has 3.57 stars out of five (thanks, idiots -- I jk :-D), 'Tree of Smoke' will endure. If you're looking for a 'fun read', just keep on walking. This isn't entertainment, this is big-L soul-scorching Literature. It's compelling, and it's intellectually nourishing, a story that will tattoo itself on your bones and neurons.

Everything since has either yet to be concluded, or produced a stalemate or checkmate that provided, at best, a wan satisfaction; at worst, an inflamed and interminable bout of indigestion\u2014and, of the latter, certainly none more painful and unsettling than those long years of struggle that encompassed the Vietnam War. To the nation that defended Sout It's quite true that, from the United States' perspective, the Second World War was the last conflict that could be considered a feel-good success. Everything since has either yet to be concluded, or produced a stalemate or checkmate that provided, at best, a wan satisfaction; at worst, an inflamed and interminable bout of indigestion\u2014and, of the latter, certainly none more painful and unsettling than those long years of struggle that encompassed the Vietnam War. To the nation that defended Southeast Asia from Japan's imperial dream in the mid-Forties it must have seemed that another glorious and successful partnership would be worked in ridding the area of the peril of expansionary communism; to have thus found themselves considered the aggressors, the imperialists, the baby-killers, worked some serious bad juju upon the mindset of America, one from which it took decades to recover its self-esteem; it has still to recover its equilibrium. So it was that upon recent consideration after a long spell of banishment in the shelves, Tree of Smoke held little appeal for me\u2014who wants to revisit that theatre of epic futility, especially when it has seemingly been mined, in film and in print, for all its worth?\u2014but the back cover blurb promising a main character who was a CIA operative engaged in Psychological Operations against the Vietcong planted a seed of interest in my mind that blossomed forth a couple of days later with a strength and pull that I could not resist. I thought this was really good. I wanted to love it, but I couldn't; I was afraid I might dislike it, but I didn't; it's a book that seems to have divided its readers into two passionate camps, both of whose arguments I can now appreciate\u2014but I'm firmly aligned with its fans, holding this thick, smoky, filmic page-turner to be a flawed work of genius. I didn't care for some of the plot decisions and turns that Johnson opted for, and I was occasionally tempted\u2014though I never acquiesced\u2014to start skimming where I sensed that Johnson was going off on another lengthy and meandering tangent; but neither of these negatives amount to much compared to Johnson's ability to pen fiction of a cinematic quality, in sweltering jungle and arid desert locations, that chronicles the destruction and dissipation and obsessions of various interconnected individuals during the turbid chaos of the Vietnam War. His aptitude for flowing, verisimilar dialogue makes this a novel that is driven by its character's conversations; indeed, it is frequently jarring in that major situations or developments are delivered in succinct summaries at the onset of a new chapter, and the character's subsequent discourses the primary means of fleshing out the details of what exactly transpired and, more importantly, how its ripples will affect the large cast of characters who populate the pages. Although the story unfolds across select years of the Vietnam War\u2014and concludes with one of its aftermath\u2014its themes are applicable across all modern day conflicts: Johnson's true setting is the Fog of War , and how, beneath its vast, disorienting, and vivifying blanket, all manner of individuals\u2014be they religious care workers, patriotic intelligence officers, Vietnamese regime supporters or communist subversives, raw rookie volunteer infantrymen, or legendary heroic figures\u2014can and do lose their way, become corrupted or degraded or upended or abraded to the degree that they no longer recognize themselves or the combination of means and ends that have seized control of their waking lives. This is a hallucinatory, smothering, violent demesne, with a CIA that is fractured, divided, and working out disparate and competing operations that break both the law and its agents' spirits; while the army is presented as a disorganized and chaotic presence, an arm that allows its soldiers the opportunity to engage in fucking up the Vietnamese, channeling their energies into a murderous violence that ofttimes slips beyond the control of a unit's officers. War is both a hellish nightmare and an ideal and exciting testing ground for men, particularly when they experience it young; every character\u2014but one\u2014eagerly anticipates entering Vietnam, each with various idealizations of what they are there to achieve and how they desire to implement these goals\u2014and each will see these desires crumble, idealizations turn into doubts\u2014everything become shambolic and corrosive. These individuals came into the war with the expectation of having the abstractions that etiolated their lives given definitive form, become reality\u2014but the truth of the matter is that what reality had existed for them was stretched and thinned out, become abstract. Southeast Asia is a sweltering, humid, liquid environment, ripe for dark nights of the soul and diseases of both the flesh and the spirit. The bifurcation of the patient and enduring natives\u2014having cast off the French and now chary of this new power arrived upon their shores\u2014and what they desire for their sorely tested homeland, and the energized, well-intended Americans, with their competitive scheming and convoluted plotting always on the verge of breaking apart into warlordism, is nicely handled. The story is driven by the trio of William \"Skip\" Sands, a CIA agent assigned to a Psy-Ops unit headed by his paternal uncle, The Colonel\u2014a larger-than-life legend whose exploits prior to, during, and after the Second World War have taken on a mythological status\u2014and the latter's perfervid and mindfuckery-minded disciple, Jimmy Storm, a sergeant on loan from the US Army. The Colonel has commandeered an Army platoon, a Vietnamese village and adjacent mountain-top Landing-Zone, and a substantial amount of bureaucratic interest and rivalry in his effort to implement a convoluted and precarious scheme to shatter the North Vietnamese Will-To-Fight at the very highest level. Riding escort duty is the intermingled tale of the Houston brothers\u2014Bill, who never sets foot in Vietnam, though\u2014or perhaps because\u2014he is marked by early death experiences; and his younger brother James, an aimless teenager trapped in the dead-end, blue-collar tedium of Phoenix, Arizona, who views service in the war as an opportunity to effect some mayhem whilst collecting a steady paycheque and escape the stifling confines of an existence that scares him\u2014and a spirited nurse for an Orphan's NGO, Kathy Jones, who provides a bit of Canadian fervor and the Calvinistic determinism that threatens to either damn or absolve these characters up front, depending upon which angle of Hell you viewed them from. These figures touch upon the lives of their Filipino and Vietnamese counterparts and servants, who are all working towards their own particular ends, ones that may\u2014or may not \u2014be aligned with a loyalty to their respective foreign benefactors and/or employers. There is a long introduction that takes place within the Philippines, a prelude to the coming experience of Vietnam\u2014and besides being a brilliantly detailed set piece, it completely and expertly delineates how both Americans and natives will be ruined by their immersion in a conflict without clear-cut borders, endowed with blurry endpoints and enframed by dubious philosophies. This is bookended with a lengthy epilogue in which the reader gets provided with snapshots of the destruction meted out by the passing of the years, the way this terrible tropical conflict has infected its character's lives, and how one particular mythological obsession has seared itself into the flesh; the cooling words of redemptive hope that drop the curtain after seven hundred and two pages offer a brief palliative to these terrible burns\u2014but a palliative only: the scarring is permanent. ...more This book was my own personal Vietnam.

But that's how it seemed! Denis \"Missing a Letter\" Johnson is supposed to be a great writer, and I can almost believe he is, but that's just what it would be: a belief. Because I saw no evidence of real, actual good writing in this book. The language was competent but not interesting. The characters were bland ciphers and caricatures. The dialogue was Delillo-esque, but in a crank-turner way, not in a good way. I'm going to go a step further and say this book reawakened in me a vague, sneering disdain for \"serious\" literature that had been lying peacefully dormant for the entire time I've been using this site.* It made me hate and fear the act of reading itself. So I'm going against my normal custom of finishing books no matter the cost--because this time the cost is too great. Is there any way I can tag Paul Bryant here? Because I've never felt like I had more in common with him than I do right now. *I can actually pinpoint the exact moment when this disdain receded into a forgotten corner of my mind. It was in March of 2008, after years of reading nothing more literary than The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, when I read the first page of Infinite Jest and realized I'd made a terrible mistake. ...more (My full review of this book is much longer than GoodReads' word-count limitations.

From the mid-1800s until World War II, the Asian country now known as Vietnam was in actuality controlled by France and operated as a colony; during WWII, then, the Japanese invaded the area so as to install a Vichy-style fascist government. It was the Vietnamese, in fact, who eventually rose up and ran this group out of the country at the end of the war, led and funded by local communists who were being secretly supported by Soviet Russia; at this point the French tried to come back in and re-establish colonialism, but the 'Viet Minh' were having none of it. That led to what's now known as the 'First Vietnam War,' or 'Indochina War' if you want to get technical, which lasted for roughly a decade and which the French (backed secretly by US resources) lost; it led in 1954 to a splitting of the country into a North and South Vietnam, with a referendum two years later that was supposed to politically reunify them again. The referendum never happened, though, because of the US continuing to stockpile more and more military in the southern half of the country; it soon led to the 'Second Vietnam War,' the enemy now known as the Viet Cong, the war many more Americans are familiar with, the one that many people say we lost as well at the end of 1973 (which was more about us giving up fighting, which is why it's contested whether we should call it \"losing a war\"). And thus did the entirety of Vietnam become communist in the mid-'70s, which was kind of a disaster until 1986 when the country first embraced free-market capitalism; now in 2007 they're one of the economically fastest-growing countries on the planet, certainly of the so-called \"third world,\" and last year hosted over three and a half million international tourists. I bring you this little tutorial, of course, because you'll need it in order to get through the absolutely mindblowing Tree of Smoke , the latest novel by revered writer Denis Johnson, and a few weeks ago officially the recipient of this year's National Book Award. It. Is. An. Astounding. Book., make no mistake, one that floored me in a particular way a novel hasn't done to me in years; but it's also a book that asks a lot out of you as a reader, not the least of which is a good four to six weeks of commitment, not to mention a fairly good understanding of 20th-century Vietnamese history before starting, plus of course with it presenting a challenge to many radical liberals as to how to think of the very concept of \"war\" itself. It's one of those big books, you know, and by \"big\" I mean in a grand, old-skool, James Michener or Herman Wouk kinda way; a book with a dozen main characters, two dozen other minor ones, all of them scattered around the planet and coming to the same central core of a story from a dozen different backgrounds and mindsets. There are good things about such books and bad things; in this case, in my opinion, a lot more good than bad, but that's partly because I'm a big fan of these kinds of novels in the first place. It's certainly one of those books that people love giving awards to, because it feels good to give an award to a book like this; it's a hefty one, not only emotionally and intellectually but also its sheer physical weight, something that makes you feel like you really accomplished something by making it all the way through. So why does Johnson's name ring a bell, you're thinking? Well, because... ...more Tree of Smoke is something like a good, plot-driven thriller (like LeCarr\u00e9 more than Clancy) injected with a heady dose of fog of war. It's a novel that looks at the Vietnam War through a wonderfully tuned eye for the humane, a critical piece that has no truck with the clich\u00e9 activisms we're used to. It's a novel about the human effects of fighting for abstractions. It's about forgiveness and salvation, about guilt itself in the face of the unswerving trueness of death.

It's a novel about the human effects of fighting for abstractions. It's about forgiveness and salvation, about guilt itself in the face of the unswerving trueness of death. It's about what we do to the world in the process of doing what we can for it. The book's gyre encompasses five Americans and one Canadian, each bound in his or her own ways to the land and people of Vietnam. The two most central characters are the Colonel - self-mythologizing man of action, old-school war hero, the eponymous Tree of Smoke - and his nephew, CIA spook Skip Sands - the young man who alternately views himself as the Quiet American and the Ugly American . In these two resides a real, unironic feeling of righteousness for the fight against Communism, a yearning for the kind of American destiny that we can all get behind. Tree of Smoke is in one sense a story of how this kind of loyalty plays out in a bloody, treacherous, and bureaucratically convoluted jungle occupation. But the totality is beyond the scope of synopsis, and the fog of war lifts only with time. This is a book I admire. The language is thrilling and refreshing, the palette constantly revitalizing itself. And the tenderness with which Johnson places these characters on his pages reveals an author honestly probing for truths, an artist whose only agenda is to make us see clearly through a malarial fog. Where he succeeds, the fact that his characters never achieve such unburdened vision becomes more than plot device; it seems more like a tragedy of history. ...more \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627

Those liking it seem to be more vocal about ending all wars (I'm trying to stay away from current politics)than those who disliked it. A couple of the 'reveiwers' showed real ignorance about the VN war and the returning vet. And a number were 'miffed' that Johnson had changed genre without telling them. More than most books (\"most\" being very loosely used without benefit of any research or even a quick count) TOS reviews/comments seem to be about the reader, not the book. That's why I enjoy reading them. So all in all, maybe that's why the selection committees liked it. Of course it is often a kiss of death to compare a novel to great fiction (I'm thinking The Quiet American comparisons). Grahame Greene is a tough act to follow and if that were my only comparison, I would think TOS a poor nephew. Authors usually cannot control what a publisher or critic will compare his work to, and have to suffer the slings and arrows nevertheless (it happened to me on my first novel and some of the 'reviews' made me consider the witness protection program) yet that novel was quite successful. So put me down in the 'didn't really like it' column, but I can't bring myself to give it only one star. That's for Harry Potter or Patterson books. ...more \u039a\u03bf\u03c1\u03c5\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\u03bf, \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03bc\u03c5\u03b8\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1, \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03af\u03c7\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae \u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03c9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf \u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03b5\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2.

I forged on, buoyed by all the acclaim and my own inability to just give up and move on. So give me my damned cookie, I finished the thing. The novel in a nutshell is largely about Skip Sands, a CIA trainee working for the military in Vietnam during the war, and assigned to his uncle, the legendary Colonel (serious echoes of the deranged Col. Kurtz here). But it's also about Trung, an NVA spy, and his uncle, Hao. And raw US newbie soldiers Bill & James Houston. And Kathy, the missionary/nurse from Canada. And solider Jimmy Storm. The priest, Father Callahan...Callaghan?...makes a brief but memorable appearance (screw it, I'm not going to open the book again to look the actual name up). As does CIA operative Voss. And a CIA assassin. And the Professor. And Gilligan. Yes, there were a lot of characters and storylines; some intersected, and some didn't, and it was very chaotic, just like war itself. War is hell, I get it. But does reading about it have to be hell, too? I can handle \u2018long,\u2019 that wasn\u2019t the issue. Situations and circumstances struck me as wholly unoriginal.

Often, their stories are brought to a close \u201coff camera\u201d and in a matter-of-fact fashion, which I thought blunted their impact. Denis Johnson reportedly spent a long time writing this, so I have to assume that these stylistic choices were his. As a novel, \u201cTree of Smoke\u201d just didn\u2019t hang together for me. I thought it was meandering, unfocused, and in need of some serious editing. Having said all of that, there were large chunks of this narrative that I really liked. Some of the prose is truly beautiful. The parallels that Johnson is making to the Iraq war are unmistakable and unnerving. Bill Houston\u2019s encounter in the jungle when he first arrives in the Phillipines is heart-rending. If a few of the subjects/arcs were short stories as part of a thematic collection, I would have liked the whole thing a lot more. ...more Another book from Les Plesko's (No Stopping Train) incredible book list, Denis Johnson's Tree of Smoke almost reaches the level of literary sublimity and transcendence of Robert Stone's quintessential Vietnam book Dog Soldiers.

Skip teeters, in Johnson's words, between the Quiet American and the Ugly American, becoming just the fucking American--that is, looking for legend but fully becoming the mess that Vietnam was. Contrasting to Sands, who struggles with the essential issues of that war, who ponders, who sifts and thinks, are the Houston brothers, first Bill, and then the rougher, cruder copy, younger brother James. Who don't think, they act--and how the war is their undoing as well as it is Sands'. The only thing that keeps this book from the heaven that is Dog Soldiers is the way the narrative is scattered among so many characters, including Sands, the two Houstons, a nurse with a missionary husband who is murdered by blowgun in the Phillipines and perhaps on the orders of hte CIA, Jimmy Storm, the legendary uncle's crazy right hand man, and a number of the vietnamese characters to boot... It is very difficult for a multiple protagonist book to squeeze down to a really resonant ending. But aside from this intrinsic and inescapable flaw, this is breath-held fiction for 700 pages. What verbal firepower, what mimicry, what tension. The first scene, in which hapless Bill Houston shoots a monkey, will burn in my brain for life. P.S.

It appears after Moses leads his \u2018ibri (Hebrews, the marginal) through the sea and out of the slavery of Egypt. It leads them through their forty years of wandering the desert. Some scripture scholars speculate that the pillar of fire /cloud was a volcano in the southern part of the Sinai, near Mt Hebron. Johnson takes this image, and translates it as \u201ctree of fire\u201d (the famous burning bush?) and suggests an association with the mushroom cloud, and so we modernists are likewise wandering for our forty years (actually, twenty: 1963-1983) in an amoral desert ever since we dropped the bomb on Hiroshima, but that\u2019s more me than Johnson. There are lots of levels that can be mined in this book. Read it, it\u2019s extraordinary. Pay no attention to critics who are trying the crack the book over their self-possessed hubris. It will be awhile before anybody masters it. Catch it while it\u2019s fresh. ...more I must not be smart enough for this book because I didn't love it the way I know I should have.

I didn't hear enough from/about the main characters (except for Skip Sands who is a constant presence)to get into that emphathetic place that makes a novel engrossing. For example, the Houston Brothers, who are supposed to be main characters are only there for about 25% of the book. I found this to be disconcerting. I guess I need more focus than this story provided. I learned some about Vietnam, which is a part of history I need to know more about, so that was good. ...more There are Tree of Smoke lovers and haters. Count me on the side of the lovers.

The time shifts in the first section might make you think you are in for a trippy update of Dispatches, but the book quickly moves into a year by year account of the destruction of a number of American and Vietnamese lives. The title represents a number of images and themes in the book. It references a verse in the Bible which a grizzled intelligence vet uses as a code name and a kind of mantra. The tree is used to signify ghosts, mushroom clouds, fire, threat and, I think, the potentially weak nature of family connection. Most of the characters wrestle with family members, some betraying and some trying to save, but nearly all lead to disaster. And like smoke, many find that their family is simply gone. Religious imagery is also significant, with characters wondering just who the Judas is and what the nature of betrayal and redemption is. Again, it is primarily at the hands of family that the action takes place and when some are accused falsely it is terribly sad. In one case, people commit wrong to help their family, and the portrayal of it is morally ambiguous. While this is a Vietnam novel, very little combat is depicted. This book is more in the mold of spy fiction with its exploration of the life of the operative and the Quiet American (which one character references more than once.) Ultimately it is about the human cost of war and it shows the cost is even worse than is usually shown. There is a wide range of characters, including a Canadian nurse whose husband disappears in the Philippines, two working class brothers who experiences in the Navy and Army do not set them up well for civilian life, a Vietnamese Viet Cong volunteer who now doubts his choice, and the elder operative. The nephew of said operative, named Skip, is the core. He, and his uncle, ties the characters together and he goes through the worst of all of them. The book's epilogue is a bit long, as it covers almost all of the surviving characters in 1983, but it helps wrap up the book. I had to re-read the opening section set in 1963, as it made little sense when first read, but clearly sets up the major themes of the book which include the possibility of spiritual death, betrayal, family and cultures which cannot comprehend one another. Ignore the haters who, in my view, criticize tangential detail. My first reaction on closing the book was that I needed to read it again because I realized that I missed quite a bit. That is the sign of a great book. ...more I'm still not sure what I feel about this book. Frankly, after reading a number reviews here on goodreads I can sympathize with them all.

But it's approaching 40 years later and he actually finished it now (even though he had notes on it back in '83). I looked a bit for interviews with Johnson on 'Tree of Smoke' because I wanted to know what he's said about it. Don't get me wrong I love all the erudite reviews and the reviews of reviews but just like in lit class I keep wondering what the author wanted to say. Until he speaks out I guess I'll have to tell you what I feel. First it wasn't about the 60's-70's. It was about now. Iraq. Afghanistan. Yes. But for me it was about the characters struggling with the ever shifting vagueness of the moral world today. So you want to love your country and defend it against the nihilistic forces of the religious mafia nationalists. But once you take the stance, once you put up your dukes the world shifts. Smarts, bravado, faith, loyalty they all aren't enough to keep you from getting really dirty and confused. The main characters in the book all think they have a way to figure war out. How to deal with. Just look at where they end up. Is it a moral lesson? I don't think either. Most of the characters come to some sort of peace with their flawed viewpoints and ways of copping. As has been pointed out the book is a bit obtuse to start and takes awhile to pick up the pace. For those that need a more straight line narrative this book will be a trial. I found that I had to make enough time to finish a full sub story so that I wasn't lost when I came back after a longer absence. And if you're looking for a plot you can predict, well move on. I often judge the strength of a book by the effect it has on me. This book disturbed me. The characters disturbed me. The story is messy and so are the characters. I didn't find myself rooting for them but I sure wanted to know what would happen. I was sometimes confused by it's complexity. And I could help feeling that Johnson was trying to tell me something. Again just look at the reviews and you'll see that the book must be multi-dimensional if readers (critics too) see it in so many different ways. I recommend it in part based on that. ...more Vietnam War (1955-1975) .

I have no doubt that it deserves both. It is a huge book, 700+ and my copy is the 1st edition hardbound. Since I normally read while in bed, I had to read few pages at a time as my rheumatic hands could not hold the book for so long. However, I kept on reading and in fact, felt sad when I finally closed the book last night. Though painful and sad particularly because of the ending, it was a worthwhile read. Philippines is the setting of the first quarter of the book and it is so interesting to know that Johnson really spent a lot of time knowing and incorporating details about life, places, names and practices here in the Philippines. It was an un-biased and almost accurate depiction of our country. Almost, because there are some small details that I guess are too minor for him to pay attention to, so, for me, given the total scheme of things, they are forgivable. As in any war novels, the battlefield scenes are mind-blowing. However, Johnson only spent a few pages on it. The reason is that Tree of Smoke is about a CIA agent, Skip Sands , and not a hard-core soldier. Although he spent years in Vietnam during the war, he did not go to the battlefield. Rather, the other characters, like brothers, Bill and James Houston who actually fought and died in the war. Their stories prior to joining the war and their communication to their loves ones and to each other while in the different places in Vietnam are the ones that really hit me in this novel. Though the title can easily be an allusion to atomic bomb, the Tree of Smoke here refers to the secret operation that involves Sands. There are several references in the novel to the title phrase, which has Biblical origins in three cited passages: Song of Solomon 3:6; Book of Joel 2:30, 31; and Exodus 33:9, 10. I am glad my Goodreads friend led me to this book last year when we visited Booksale MOA during one of our group\u2019s mini-meetups.

As much as \"Catch-22\" was an anti-Vietnam hidden behind a WWII novel, \"Tree of Smoke\" can be read as an anti-Iraq novel hidden behind a Vietnam novel. It is a gripping novel that opens with Kennedy assassination in 1963. It follows Skip Sands, a serviceman who spends a majority of the book undercover and completely confused by his mission and yet steadfast in his support of Vietnam; and the Houston brothers, mostly the younger James, and their enlistment and experiences serving in Vietnam. As a Vietnam-era novel, Johnson allows a lot of the usual subjects to move the plot. We see the contrast in Sands' unwavering support of the effort versus his mother's question of justice; and minor characters such as Kathy who questions God versus the Houston brother's mother who is absolutely certain of God's support of the war effort. Naturally, given the last two especially, the religious and thus moral conflict come into play. \"Can there be war without God?\" it is asked in the novel. With the various backgrounds, races and genders that scope the novel, everyone is forced to try and find answers to a war that raises a lot of questions. Though present, I didn't find the religious aspect to be heavy-handed but instead thought it offered a necessary frame for why characters held the opinions they did. With no clear hero and no clear answer to questions raised, it makes sense that Johnson's novel garners a lot of negative reviews. We are forced to confront the unanswered questions and moral ambiguity that are natural elements to the human condition. An amazing read but not for a person looking for a light read.

Some passages were weird beyond recognition...that may have been the authors point..that the war was weird beyond recognition. That the duplicity necessary to survive was normal and expected. That the lessons to be learned are never learned in the theater of war. This book is the antidote to every manuscript exspousing the patriotism and nobility of war. It chronicles the shifting sands and alliegences necessary to be successful. Lessons of course so applicable to our current war footing. I imagine that because there is no calvary on a white horse to make things right only more questions at the end than answers is what made this a national book award book. But I get it...my personal standard is ..out of 20 characters give me at least one capable of heroic actions..wait a minute there were plenty of heroic actions just no heros. And resolve the fates of 15 of them..no wait..fifteen of them did end ignobly..a great book..too long and unresolved (you know how us unlettered like quick fixes) to merit more stars from me..In a month upon reflection I may adjust upward. ...more Let's talk about Big Sprawling Novels, or, from here on out, BSN's.

I liked the rude Americans' encounters on the far edges of Western influence, I liked the flickering, revolting imagery, I liked the honest depictions of human brutality. On a personal note, I'm rather delighted it ended in the remote hills of Yala Province, Thailand, an area few Westerners have ever visited but that is very dear to my heart.

The Vietnam War is approached from a variety of angles--infantry, tunnel rat, South Vietnamese fighter pilot, North Vietnamese agent, CIA operative, outsourced assassin--to attempt to give a complete picture of a convoluted epoch in world history. Going further, Johnson successfully ties these threads into a highly arresting narrative. And even further, the narrative is bursting with philosophy about what the War meant. The phrase \"Tree of Smoke\" is more than just a catchy title, etc. 'Tree of Smoke' contains a jarringly realistic vision of what it means when the front line catches up to you. The prose is lean but potent. I didn't find the plot to be lacking a motor, in fact I read this book quite quickly. Denis Johnson's prior longish novel, 'Already Dead,' sort of descended into a quagmire toward the end. Not so with 'Tree of Smoke.' It's obvious that this subject meant a lot to him, and leads one to suspect he had long wanted to write about the Vietnam War. I can only assume that as years pass this novel will be looked back upon as the quintessential novel of the Vietnam War. You should read it. ...more I think I'm Denis Johnson's ideal reader in some ways--his first novel, Angels, and then his collection of short stories, Jesus's Son, are among my favorite books.

The things Johnson does so well--for example, his keen, poignant portraits of people desperately clinging to the edge of life--don't quite come to life here. He has his usual cast of desperados, including Bill Houston from Angels, but I never quite feel their heartbeat. Since the book weighs in at nearly 700 pages and covers the time span of the Viet Nam war, it promises to provide new historical angles, but I felt as if the Viet Nam scenes were cliched, watered-down versions of Apocalypse Now or other Viet Nam classics. Granted, it's difficult to portray this era in a fresh light given the number of books and films that have explored it, but this is Denis Johnson, one of our most original authors, so I expect more from the strange place he views the world from. I'm still thinking about this novel. I wonder if he works better in shorter forms. In some ways, the novel's length seemed to indicate an author who was trying to nail down his story.

The book focuses on thriller-type scenes, usually violent, with alternating domestic scenes to give some local color or background. The novel is captivating and well-written, often beautifully written, but Johnson, who is far above the average thriller/best-seller grade, can't or won't expand his topic, even with a few lines, into American political or economic motives. I make this complaint fairly regularly because so many writers stop short when writing about subjects like war, where politics are the dominant theme, so the subject feels incomplete and undeveloped. A few sentences here and there to add perspective doesn't turn the work into a 'political' novel \u2013 a meaningless term anyway unless it's a work of pure propaganda. The term is often used as a bizarre put-down, suggesting there's an axe to grind or that the subject is not fit for lyrical fiction. Johnson finds the space to deliver a few hateful lines about hippies(appropriately from a soldier's mouth) and a lot of tough guy talk about our way versus their way and how abstract(in his view) war is, but not a peep about what a 'difficult' decision it must have been in the White House, Pentagon and corporate boardrooms to saturate an entire nation with poisonous defoliants...a bit of perspective, just to give one possible example. Another could have been a few lines about Kissinger's treasonous spying for Nixon at the 1968 Paris peace talks to derail them so that Nixon could get elected, on a campaign to end the war!

There are a lot of scenes in this novel that I feel I've seen or read several times before, almost like standard issue American literary bleakness: violent, sadistic scenes with crazed US soldiers and the flip side emptiness of life back in America; a life of endless bar fights, jail and low-paying jobs. The American scenes come off as patronizing and the war scenes as lurid clich\u00e9s. There's a very potent religious anguish in many of the better passages, that views life as a violent sacrifice to some impossible ideal.

This was 'Tree of Smoke' is a failure. A very good, very long, likable failure. It is like spending an afternoon attempting to skip stones across a river and failing in this effort while succeeding in other important ways. The stones never skip; but do you not learn more about the stones, and about yourself, in the process? Does your mind not increasingly hone in to the small successes and failures that determine the fate of each throw? Do you not remain entranced despite mounting frustrations? This was my experience with 'Tree of Smoke,' a book that attempts to relay the tragedy of the Vietnam war by emphasizing its banality and pointlessness. We've seen this treatment of war before, in books like 'Catch-22,' but Johnson's strategy here is much less hysterical and much more diffuse. The novel has (arguably) 4 major characters and perhaps as many as 7, some failing to overlap completely, but all of them morally and emotionally destitute in the end. And/or dead. Many of these characters do not even cross paths, and the novel's interest in them provokes much thought on the reader's end. The novel's readability is, I would say, marred by this lack of narrative focus, Why did I like it? I have a deep affection for ToS because it is a pretty unique contribution to the war genre. True, his characters engage war jargon and soldier-speak pretty constantly, they have sex with whores on many of the novel's 600-odd pages. But unlike many works of the genre, ToS fails, or refuses, to approach the extreme violence that any depiction of this war would seem to dictate. To be sure, much violence occurs here. A small animal is senselessly shot in the book's opening pages. A dedicated soldier jumps onto a grenade and covers it with his body and waits for death. A small woman is pulled from a forest, raped by 5 soldiers and mutilated for no reason. This is a brutal book, but not one that revels in its brutality, and I think this is what I admired about it. But the book could have offered more extremes, could have offered more that was finite and tangible and poignant and clear. Why do some characters disappear into myth, while others are offered no resolution at all? Why the emphasis on parents, orphans and lineage without some clearer of exploration of the need for this emphasis? As well, the caricatures in this novel never redeem themselves. The structure is often inexplicable. There is a journey toward the end of the novel that seems to have no place here, at a point in the novel's narrative when such missteps are increasingly less excusable. And Johnson makes the mistake here that Hemingway was often accused of -- perhaps even more egregiously than Hemingway -- in that the only strong feminine presence in the novel is an oft-hysterical woman. I liked this book. But it fails because it never really gets around to telling us what it wants to be about. It is all implication, all exposition, all 'What' without enough probing of the 'Why?' or the 'What next?' This novel is a cold, dead body on the battle field, in need of a pulse. ...more Hm. Let me back up here (back up, back up) because I'm not sure anyone wants to hear this. It ain't all that. There are big problems with some redundant characters and both flat writing and listless plotting in the opening chapters. Then it gets good. Then the last section kills. But I can't help but think that if this were a debut, I would not have persisted through the sloppier portions of it, and I really don't think epic is Johnson's game.

Now let me add one big saving grace that has nothing to do with the quality of writing or the author's pedigree. It is a novel about a quagmire of a war, it is a novel about the military machine getting ahead of itself, it is a novel with insights on that specific variety of corruption that brought me near weeping. Many times. I should not get up in the morning forgetting that my countrymen are being blown up, blowing other people up, for no good reason. For no reason but that admitting the waste of it is too colossally devastating to accept. So read this, or read something like it, so you can remember every day what your country is doing on the other side of the world. Effect change, and say to the people you talk to every day, \"I'd like a grande caramel macchiato, and the war needs to end now,\" or \"She's doing great in school, loves her teacher, and the war needs to end now,\" or \"I love you I love you I love you the war needs to end now.\" Like that. ...more This may be the best Vietnam book I've ever read (and I've read several). The trippy sweep of story and language seems appropriate. And unlike other Vietnam novels, this one dares to be epic, and succeeds! If Pynchon and Robert Stone had decided to write a book together, it might look like this. Basically, Tree of Smoke strikes me as an only part-successful attempt by an acclaimed author to break out of the style that made him famous. Everyone wants to change and develop, and it made sense that Tree of Smoke would be damned good: Johnson began to cultivate a fading in-and-out style with Angels, and you could probably say that he improved that style with Jesus' Son, although I personally prefer Angels because Jesus' Son doesn't have anyone hallucinating about being gods in it (someone do Basically, Tree of Smoke strikes me as an only part-successful attempt by an acclaimed author to break out of the style that made him famous.

You wake up and find yourself in a car, you drive around for a while, you fall asleep. Tree of Smoke, then, wants us to stay awake in the car, wants to let us know why we're in the car and how we got there and, most importantly, what happens along the way. Now, since this is only my third Denis Johnson book and since the three books I've read by him were released across a span of twenty-four years, I don't know if Johnson made concessions toward a more conventional style in between Jesus' Son and here, but for now, it looks to me like this is Johnson's way of reminding his critics that there's nothing up his sleeve, that he knows what happens in the gaps between his stories, that he's well aware Bill (I mean the Angels version of Bill, but the same character is in this book, along with his dysfunctional family, and definitely the most compelling and divided character in the book; if you consider the two intertextually, I can only imagine that Angels is meant to be Houston's penance for what happens here) and Jamie didn't get lifted from Chicago to Arizona in Angels. So far, so good. I've complained about Angels feeling mashed together, which is pretty much the only significant flaw of that book as far as I'm concerned, but the problem here is you realize you weren't in the car for any other reason than you left your wallet behind, the people you're driving with aren't as interesting as you'd think based on the snatches of conversation you'd caught while you were drifting between sleep and wakefulness, and that, above all, you've driven past that gigantic Santa statue with the high beams under its dead eyes six times now. My basic beef with Tree of Smoke is this: there are a bunch of different threads here, but the only ones that satisfied me were the Houston family's threads. Bill tries to do the honorable thing in a dishonorable war, his younger brother James hates the misery of 'nam but hates kicking around rural Arizona more and keeps coming back, his younger brother Burris falls into crime and drugs and general despondence, and their mother maintains religious fervor no matter what, which you'd better believe haunts all three of them. It's a good, compelling, rich story, perfect for a three hundred page novel. Skip Sands' isn't so interesting to me, and here's where the trouble kicks in: his portions, which are enormous, don't really develop, they just run circles around \"I want to break out of my uncle the colonel's shadow but can't because I'm in his employ and his shadow is long.\" Which is a plausible conflict, but too obligatorily literary and on top of that, too well-mined - the change of the typical \"break away from the old man's world\" setting doesn't make it feel any less forced, doesn't make it feel any less like Johnson pulled it out of a guide to writing serious fiction and slapped it in there just because. Plus there's a lot of talking in this book. A LOT. A lot of unattributed dialog, which is fine in Gaddis because Gaddis' unattributed dialog often implies action and sets tone and reveals character, but here, they're just these long cyclical conversations without any weirdo charm like you get from DeLillo's long cyclical conversations. I longed for someone to slip into DeLillo mode and lecture us about how collecting other people's dryer lint predicted the oncoming technological singularity, but no luck, no dice, no momentum. \"Hey, we gonna pull off the operation?\" \"Sure, we'll pull off the operation.\" \"It's gonna be a good operation.\" \"Yeah, we'll get Charlie. We'll hit Charlie where he least expects it.\" Pages upon pages of this. And yet, Johnson hits his stride sometimes. The last chapter goes by in this breathless rush, part mystery, part thriller, part exploration of consequences, and part redemption story, all great, great, great. And there are a lot of vivid and eerie and immaculately turned set pieces in dingy bars and the southwestern wastes. But I just can't shake the feeling that Denis Johnson's style and the behemoth-length novel don't go together well. ...more This book makes me want to be a novelist at the same time that it makes me realise (again) how very hard it is to pull off.

How many different people can one person manage to be subtle and perceptive about at the same time? A lot, apparently, if you know what you're doing. Unlike, say, Ian McEwan. Just saying. I'm having quite a hard time keeping up with a succession of characters who seem vaguely familiar from an earlier part of the novel, so I'm tracking back a lot, but that also makes me recognise how very skilful Johnson is. In a strange way this novel is reminding me of Shirley Hazzard's Great Fire, even though they're very different in many ways. There's something about the intensity and the indirection of both books that makes them seem similar. Perhaps they're two sides of the same coin: novels about war faraway and long ago with an emotional intensity that figures in the smoke and fire of their titles? It's also very interesting that we are forced to think about Graham Greene's Quiet American early on in this novel. I'm sure that's not coincidental. Lots more about this to come as I read further, but so far this book is definitely living up to the hype, which is a very rare event these days. ************* UPDATE: OK, I've finished this now. Quite an incredible experience, and I feel quite strange saying that I loved this book without ever quite understanding it fully. Reviews pointed to events that I really don't recall happening (was the double really relaying the possibility of a nuclear strike to the north? Never happened as far as I could tell. Could someone give me a page number?) and theorized about things that seemed even more far-fetched than the Vietnam War itself - please, let's not try to hard to make this into a Christian allegory; those round pegs are very difficult to fit into the novel's square holes. But what an amazing journey. I'd read this again if I had the energy, but I'm getting too old for that. I have to move on to the next one already. Only my own inadequacy prevents me from giving this five stars. In other words, if I'd understood it better, it would have got them. I was also incredibly impressed with the invocation of other Vietnam texts, directly or indirectly, along the way. There's a lot to be said about this novel. I hope some appropriately-equipped intellectuals will do it justice in years to come. UPDATE UPDATE: OK, I'm just going to give this five stars. It's better than everything I gave four stars, and it seems churlish to withhold the final star simply because I might not have grasped every detail of the subterfuge at work in the plot. ...more<---C>Denis Johnson</---C>", "Title": "Tree of Smoke"},
