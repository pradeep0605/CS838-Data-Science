(hide spoiler) ] . definitely a well-executed book, and there are more to come?? sign me up right now. a note on cursing. i am no lady, i am pretty comfortable with a wide range of salty talk. and sometimes, you can tell that some teen fiction is just dropping its f-bombs to shock or titillate its audience, all commiserating \"oooh - don't tell the grownups!!\" this was a book in full control of its potty mouth. a rainbow of expletives, masterfully handled. it brought a tear to the eye to see such a well-developed sense of vulgarity. again,<---M> not for shock value</---M>, but just the way kids curse. only funnier. and more elegantly. it is an art, after all. most kids use it as a weapon. so between that, the maroon type (sucker for that), and the pathos and humor, this was an easy five-star book. i may never be scared of a book again,but at least i can still be entertained.

Cas Lowood has, and the unholy hell of what he finds when he investigates will make you jump a little bit in your seat. He's a 17-year-old who kills the dead with a magic athame, just as his father did before him--and now he's faced with the task of killing Anna, a homicidal ghost who was murdered more than 60 years ago. Cas is a fantastically strong and appealing protagonist, but it's really Anna who takes center stage. Imagine the visual of a pale girl with inky hair floating in a dark house, her beautiful white dress slowly drip-drip-dripping with blood. She's deadly dangerous and full of vengeful fury, however, because of the way she was killed. When you find out what really happened to Anna, it's hard not to feel terrible pity for her--and to understand why Cas has such a hard time killing her. If you've been looking for a great YA horror novel, look no further. <+++>Anna Dressed in Blood</+++> is a stunning novel, full of atmospheric spookiness and unthinkable horrors. I cringed reading about ghosts with stones where their eyes should be, I yelped when Cas goes down into a basement full of...dreadful things, and my eyes got as big as saucers when the walls starting bleeding. But although the descriptions are full of vivid imagery and there's plenty of brutal action, what happens isn't at all gross. If anything, there's a dark beauty in the descriptions and an elegance in the writing that makes every scene a true pleasure to read. My reading status updates will give you a peek at some of the lines and scenes that particularly made me shiver, but I really had to restrain myself from posting one every couple of pages, as there's so much to savor, even in simple but humorous lines such as \"She's wearing the same smile as her cat.\" I found just as much to love in the writing as I did the fantastic story, and the cheeky humor made me laugh even in dire and inappropriate circumstances. This is the darker, more grown-up version of Hold Me Closer, Necromancer , and it's much more violent and much more polished. Anna offers an unforgettable thrill of a ride--and it catapulted instantly to my favorites list for the year. I am so excited about this author and I can't wait for the sequel, Girl of Nightmares , to come out in 2012. Read it, read it, read it! I promise it will make you shudder, in the very best of ways.

Nothing is less fun then getting up in the middle of a dark night to tend to your son. You're creeping through the halls thinking over and over in your head, \"Ghosts aren't real. Ghosts aren't real. Fuck what was that?! Nothing, okay? That was nothing because ghosts aren't real. Ghosts aren't real.\" It's not a perfect novel. Apart from the pants-shitting terror, there is Cas to deal with. A lot of other reviews cover how his head space is occasionally annoying to be in. For me, that just felt like realism because if I were a badass, devil-may-care, teenage ghost hunter (if they existed, little bro) then I'd probably be really smarmy and annoying too. What I really enjoyed was Anna and her relationship with Cas. Anna was like the girl next door. If the girl next door tore livers out of people to play hackey sack with, that is. She's this really lovely, murdersome, complicated ghost character. Although, I have to wonder how much she has to complain about really. I mean, sure, she's a dead horror-monster stuck in a house filled with the spiritual husks of her victims - but she died in a really awesome dress! And it even changes colour from white to red depending on how sadistically evil and murdery she feels at that time. Downside? I can't think of one. I enjoyed the writing, the cast of characters, the plot and the pacing. I enjoyed pretty much everything about this novel. I mean, who wouldn't want to spend the next two weeks pondering why the interrobang ever managed to fall out of popular use while roaming the dark halls of their house? \"What the hell was that?!\" \"Is it going to eat me?!\" \"Will they hear me scream!?\" \"Why'd I read that stupid, fucking book... shitamIgoingtodie!?\" \"When is the next one coming out?!\" ...more Don't forget to check out the epic interview story with <---A>Kendare Blake</---A> over at Cuddlebuggery Book Blog !

The badness was just that entertaining. Then, there are other books that are really good books, but just do nothing for you. <+++>Anna Dressed in Blood</+++> was the latter for me. There was nothing wrong with this book. It's just that ghost books and I don't get along. I typically stay away from only two paranormal creatures: ghosts and zombies. I probably would have never picked this book up on my own, but I figured I'd give Anna Dressed in Blood a shot for two reasons: 1) It came highly recommended to me from several reviewers and 2) The last time I read a zombie book (The Forest of Hands and Teeth) I really enjoyed it. So I was hoping to have a similar experience. Unfortunately, I didn't. The three biggest issues I had with the book: Cas For the most part I did like him, but in the beginning I found him to be a bit conceited. When he first arrives in Thunder Bay, Ontario he walks around the school like he's way too cool to be there. To his credit, I guess he really is. I mean, he kills ghosts for a living. But the way those girls just fawned over him, like he was some Grecian god, was just a little over the top. I make my way to her table, seeing eyes growing wider as I do. Ten or so other girls probably just developed instantaneous crushes on me, because they see that Carmel likes me. Then there was the issue with him being the only one able to kill ghosts. He kept repeating, \"I'm the only one who can do this\" and I kept asking, \"Oh, yeah? Why? Why, Cas? What makes you so speshul ?\" Yes, I realize he comes from a long line of ghost busters hunters, but why his family? What makes his bloodline different from anyone else? I needed background info and I never got it. Anna Anna Dressed in Blood. I was told to read this book with the lights on. Usually, I scare very easily. I wasn't scared one bit while reading. At first, when Cas \"runs into\" Anna, I was thinking, \"Uh, oh. It's about to go down .\" And for a minute it did. (view spoiler) [Anna tore dipshit Mike in half. (hide spoiler) ] I was shocked and even more shocked that I liked it. I was starting to think that everyone who recommended me this book was on to something. Anna. Oh, Anna. Why couldn't you remain scary? This is what I wanted from you: I wanted you to run around angry, strike some fear in people's hearts, make me afraid of the dark for a few nights, tear some shit up. But this is what I got instead: For some odd reason you didn't have the urge to hurt Cas, which is never explained. Again, why is this kid so speshul ? The Romance This is honestly where the book started to lose me. Killer vindictive girl running around killing people? I can handle that. Cas going all \"goo-goo eyes\" over a dead girl? Yeah, um...it didn't work for me. But who am I to judge? If Cas likes it when Anna makes her eyes go black, her veins crawl up her arms, her deep, neck wound opening up to create her flowing blood dress, calling her \"My Anna\" , then that is totally his business. I just didn't see where that relationship was supposed to be headed. (view spoiler) [Then they made out on the front porch of her possessed house and all I could think was, \"Ew www ...\" (hide spoiler) ] It was different, I'll give Blake that, but it just didn't work for me. Other things that bothered me: I did not understand the mythology behind Cas' knife and the villain. It went straight over my head. I felt maybe that part could have been explained better. However, I suppose it's entirely possible that my little, simple brain could not grasp the complex explanation given. Maybe. Cas' mother being so accepting of her son's profession. If your husband is killed while ghost hunting, wouldn't you try everything you could to have him not go down the same road? Thomas' grandfather says he wanted Cas originally to kill Anna because she was acting different. I thought that was going to be significant to the plot, but we never found out why her behavior had initially changed. I took issue how the kids in the story had so little empathy for their friends who were killed. When (view spoiler) [Mike (hide spoiler) ] dies, Will makes up a some half-assed story about him walking home alone (bold is mine): \u201cWe tell the cops that we drove around for a while. Then...got mad about Carmel and Cas and got out of the truck. None of us could stop him. He said he was going to walk home, and since it wasn\u2019t that far away, we didn\u2019t think anything of it. When he didn\u2019t show at school today, we figured that he was hung over.\u201d But then when the police question Cas and Carmel a few days later (I've taken his name out due to spoilers)... \u201c You are aware that...lived at least ten miles from the area you\u2019re talking about ,\u201d Officer Roebuck said. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know,\u201d I reply. \u201cWe tried to stop him,\u201d Carmel pipes up. Now, I'm not sure if that inconsistency was on purpose, but Will is supposed to be this guy's best friend. He wouldn't notice that the story he made up was off? Most of the time in the book it felt like the kids were too busy about getting blamed for a crime that they never took time to care that someone was murdered. Last but not least: (view spoiler) [Tybalt being eaten by the \"boogeyman\" type ghost. (hide spoiler) ] That part really made me angry. Things I liked: 1. I thought Carmel and Cas were going to end up together. I was happy to see Blake didn't go for that very easy trope. 2. Anna's story was very sad and made it easy to be sympathetic towards her. 3. Never saw the villain coming. He was confusing, but unpredictable. All in all, I would still recommend this book to other people because the biggest reason why I didn't love it was because I just don't like ghosts. *shrug* More reviews and more at Cuddlebuggery Book Blog .

PLOT SUMMARY : With all of the wonderful reviews already committed to GR for this novel, I'll keep this portion fairly sweet. Meet young Dean Winchester Cas Lowood: Cas travels around the country with his Wiccan Mother killing (so to speak) ghosts. \u2026Dammit, where were you when we needed you. Cas comes from a long line of ghost exterminators and took over from his father when daddy got murdered by a particularly nasty apparition. Now, armed with his family\u2019s special ghost-killing knife called an athame , Cas and his mom have arrived in Thunder Bay, Ontario to dispose of a particularly nasty ghost known as Anna Dressed in Blood. It seems Anna has been butchering, and I mean slicing, dicing, mincing and tearing to chunky shreds of human jerky, anyone stupid enough to venture inside the house in which she resides. THOUGHTS : Things I loved: ** The Mythology : I thought the author did a stellar job of developing a mythology that was familiar and instantly comfortable for the reader and yet was also accented with enough unique frills and imaginative flavor to make the fantasy/horror elements feel daisy fresh and original. I also thought there was a depth to the world that the author did a great job of creating without resorting to a lot of info dumpiness. The author kept the focus on telling the story and deftly spiced in info goodies from time to time as a happy seasoning. ** The Daddy Factor : As a dad, one metric I use to judge a story like this is to ask myself the following the two questions: (1) Are the leading female characters people that I would want my girls to either befriend, emulate and/or identify with? (2) Are the main male characters guys that I would want my daughters to associate with or fall for\u2026 (eventually I mean\u2026when they are in their 30s and have completed Med School, traveled the world and written their first best seller)? For both (1) and (2), with a few minor pickies, this book gets gold stars and a resounding YES from me. I thought each of Anna (supernatural beastliness aside), Carmel and Cas\u2019 mother were richly drawn characters that I really came to appreciate over the course of the story. Despite some minor Cas-bashing below, I thought he was a good guy and his \u201ctalented\u201d friend Thomas was terrific. Of course, there were the usual suspects of stereotypical ass jacking jocks that I thought was a smidgen too easy and a few of the supporting females were a tinkle too googly-eyed over Cas for my gag reflex\u2026but again, that\u2019s dad talking. Overall, Ms. Blake gets an \u201cA\u201d on characters. ** Anna : Anna gets her own special mention because I thought she was slathered in special sauce and I was smitten from the moment she ripped that shit sack in two. However, what truly raised the bar for me from cool character to mega memorable was Anna\u2019s heart-wrenching story and the origin of her current predicament. All that strength and power and yet saddled by loss, longing and an almost unimaginable load of grief. She tugged on my heart strings like a lawn mower chain. ** The Villain : I don\u2019t want to say more and spoil the fun but\u2026nicely done. ** The Opening Scene : What a superb beginning to the book. The intro to Cas and his first job that we tag along for is outstanding. Grabbed me right away. ** Anna and Cas : The romance/friendship was perfectly done. No over the top melodrama or swoon-filled heart-palpitations, but a strong, believable bond based on mutual respect and soul-mateness. ** Cas : I\u2019m going to end with Cas as he has the distinctly dubious honor of being on both my pro and my faux list. Overall, I really like Cas and I think he was a positive aspect of the book. At both the beginning and the end, I thought he performed admirably. However\u2026 Things that irked me: ** Cas as James Dean Winchester : The Cas as the dark, brooding loner who knows he\u2019s just a little too cool and grown up for the rest of his piers\u2026nails on a chalkboard to me. A few teeth-gritting examples: \u201cStill, people\u2019s eyes tend to linger on me longer, because even though I\u2019m new, I don\u2019t move like it.\u201d \u201cOr Maybe I\u2019m just damn easy on the eyes.\u201d \u201cQueen bees are just part of the job. Sometimes that\u2019s hard to remember.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m too proud to turn around \u2013 I\u2019ve been through too much scary shit to be put off by any human attacker.\u201d In a word\u2026BARF!! I really struggled with this I'm so battitude and the whole causeless rebel posturing. Still, to his credit, nothing Cas actually did ever rated him anywhere on the asshole scale and he turned out, as I mentioned above, to be a great guy and an excellent character. Thus, I'm going to chalk the above up to Ms. Blake having a difficult time finding her \u201cguy\u201d voice. ** (view spoiler) [ Tybalt : The swinging of the tail by Mr. Nasty bugged the shit out of me. I am a major animal lover and cats are my numero uno. I loved the character of Tybalt and how he could sense ghosts and I just thought that him getting the snack treatment was\u2026just\u2026plain\u2026wrong!! There were plenty of people to chew on. (hide spoiler) ] Overall, the positives significantly outweighed the relatively minor gripes and I thought this was a terrific story. I am not the typical target audience for this and so my thorough enjoyment of this is high praise indeed. The writing was good and the story-telling was excellent with nice pacing, interesting info nuggets and some well placed chills. 3.5 Stars. Recommended!

SO DO I. And that's exactly what I was hoping to find in this book. It didn't disappoint. Let me set the scene for you: A dark road. A classic car. A young badass with an \"I don't give a shit\" attitude who hunts ghosts. Oh, and his name is Cas, his father is dead, and he's hell bent on avenging him. Hmmmm\u2026this all seems very familiar. So be warned, Supernatural fanatics, some of this strikes quite close to home. At least in the beginning. I still recommend giving it a try, because once the story gets rolling, the plot truly stands on its own. And if you're worried that it might be too scary for you, think again. I'm a wuss, and I only got creeped out twice. Blake's haunting prose makes this much more atmospheric than frightening. \"We're driving close to the lake now, and I can hear Superior whisper to me in waves about all of the dead things she hides beneath her surface, staring through the depths with murky eyes and fish-bitten cheeks.\" The one thing that keeps this from being a five star read for me are the tropes. Insta-love chief among them. Look, I get it, teenagers are blinded by hormones, blah, blah, blah. But how the ever-loving fuck can you fall in love with a psychotic, rampaging murder-ghost? And you're telling me (view spoiler) [that after kissing a dead girl you start to think about your future with her? AS IF YOU HAVE ONE? You're going to keep aging and she'll be sixteen forever, dude. *cue Dazed and Confused Matthew McConaughey flashback* Too bad. I'm not spelling it out for you. Go watch the movie because it's fucking awesome. (hide spoiler) ] Okay, so tropes aside, this was a solid read. I quickly found myself invested in Cas's story, the pacing had an organic momentum that never felt forced, I didn't see the plot twists coming, and as soon as I set it down I wanted to pick up the next. Which I'm about to do. So if you'll excuse me, I'll leave you with this: This review can also be found on The Book Eaters .

I never expected Kendare Blake to be one of those authors \u2013 that\u2019s why her book took me completely by surprise. It was very different from what I thought it would be. When I choose a book based on a beautiful cover and an intriguing title (and yes, I really AM that shallow), especially one that none of my friends have read, I usually end up disappointed. Anna Dressed in Blood undoubtedly looks amazing and has a memorable title, but the most interesting part is right where it should be \u2013 between the covers. Cassius Theseus Lowood grew up in an unconventional family. His mother is a white witch and his father was in the business of killing the dead for the second time, at least until one of the ghosts he was hunting murdered him in the most gruesome way. In Cas\u2019s world, dead people often don\u2019t want to leave the place where they died, especially if they were victims of a violent crime. Instead, they stay behind as monstrous echoes of their former selves \u2013 most of them seeking revenge for the horrors they experienced. When Cas\u2019s father died, Cas inherited his duties and his powerful athame. He\u2019s been moving all over the country and killing ghosts since he was 14 years old. But he\u2019s never run into a ghost as powerful as Anna nor did he ever try so hard to understand what drives a dead person to murder innocent people. Anna is different in every way. She was killed in 1958. while walking to the prom in her beautiful white dress. When her throat was slit, blood covered her entirely, thus earning her the name Anna Dressed in Blood. Someone cut her throat, but that\u2019s an understatement. Someone nearly cut her head clean off. They say she was wearing a white party dress, and when they found her, the whole thing was stained red. That\u2019s why they call her Anna Dressed in Blood. Ever since her murder, Anna\u2019s been tied to the house she grew up in. Twenty seven people have tried to enter, and none of them came out alive. Nothing is black and white in Anna's story: she is both a killer and a victim, a horrible monster and an innocent girl \u2013 and just when you think you figured her out, she turns around and does something completely unexpected! Her entire personality changes as quickly as her appearance which forces Cas to doubt every single choice he made since the beginning of his hunt.

I live alone and I scare easily. :D (hide spoiler) ] , but black witches, white witches, people trapped in walls, Voodoo, athames, ghost hunting, cursed objects, a strong male protagonist and unexpected developments made me very happy that I decided to read this book. I really hope it gets the attention it deserves. ...more 4.5 Anna Stars I'm not going to write a long review. There's really no need. Anna Dressed in Blood is New York Times bestselling author Kendare Blake's most provocative, compelling, and heart-wrenching story yet, and most reviews rate it as excellent. Those facts speak for themselves and there really is nothing to say other than to echo the praise of previous reviewers. I shall say only one thing. Read it if you haven't already. Anna Dressed in Blood was a surprisingly good read. I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting, something typical of young adult urban fantasy perhaps... same old characters, lots of romancing, maybe even an interesting little mystery to give the book some semblance of plot if we're lucky. I was really quite pleased with this exciting, slightly spooky, and wholly entertaining start to the series. I cannot stress highly enough how glad I am that Kendare Blake wrote a romance that was gradually in Anna Dressed in Blood was a surprisingly good read.

I was really quite pleased with this exciting, slightly spooky, and wholly entertaining start to the series. I cannot stress highly enough how glad I am that Kendare Blake wrote a romance that was gradually introduced as the story moved along and the characters developed. It would have been so easy - and not at all unexpected - for the author to just create an insta-loving, destiny bound pair, completely devoid of all chemistry and certain to be walking off into the sunset holding hands and singing folk songs at the novel's close. But no. I was able to see how the relationship changed and developed and it was not unclear to me why these two would fall for one another. Also, I had been unaware that the protagonist was male, just assuming that the book would be told from Anna's point of view. I will say of Cas what I said of another Cas(tiel) who I enjoyed reading about: he was easy to relate to, but at the same time he was believably male. Something which appears to be rather difficult if books like Tempest are anything to go by. In this case, Cas is a ghost hunter just like his father was before him and he travels around the world attempting to rid it of spirits that are left with enough supernatural energy to be able to physically harm humans. Someday he hopes to avenge his father's death at the hands of a particularly vicious ghost. But before that, he has one final test. A spook to rival all spooks, a powerful and wicked goddess of death... Anna Korlov. Anna dressed in blood. The story had me interested from the very first chapter and kept me glued to the pages throughout. The book actually has two big mysteries to solve and an interesting twist towards the end so I remained thoroughly mystified. Some people found this book scary, others not so much, I would say that there's one part which you wouldn't want to read when you're alone in your house at night but other than that it's more gory and gross than actually frightening. So beware if you're squeamish but expect a wild and exciting ride. ...more First off, I feel I should discuss the cover art: I know, I know--everyone loves this cover.

You know how Cake Pops are the newest, coolest thing in baked goods? And everyone's all \"O mai, it'ss teh caaaaaaaake popssssssss!\"? And you're standing there thinking, sure they're cute but they're just little glorified cupcakes on sticks ? Well, let me start by saying: Anna Dressed in Blood is the Cake Pop of the publishing industry. Sure it's cute(-ish) but I fail to see what the big deal is. Seriously, what's the big deal? I've read several reviews that claim this book is hilarious and disgusting and terrifying. Plus! Awesome Characters! Weird Romance! I was under the impression Anna Dressed in Blood was the YA version of Fargo, except with a Very Murdery Ghost instead of a woodchipper. And I was all, sign me up! My mistake was falling for the hype & actually believing the rumors. It's not laugh-out-loud funny \"Hey\" he says, pulling up a chair. \"Aren't you going to eat your Jell-o?\" \"I effing hate green Jell-o,\" I reply, and push it his way. \"I hate it too. I was just asking.\" I laugh. \"Don't make me hurt my ribs, you dick.\" Bahahahahaha. So funny, right? Kidding! I'm not sure which parts were supposed to be funny, actually. Even during the 30% of this book I did enjoy I never laughed, not even in my head. I'd have settled for a \"that's what she said\" joke. I'm not too picky when it comes to humor. It's not terrifying. (Not even a little.) I keep reading reviews that claim this book is scary. It isn't. Yeah, there's a ghost (a couple, actually). Yeah, Anna likes to make it look like her dress is dripping with blood. Yeah, she murders people. But it just so happens that none of that scared me. If there was a demonic clown in this book then I might have been a little frightened. But, alas, no demonic clowns. It's not a paranormal romance As far as I'm concerned it's not PNR unless the romance is a major part of the story. Believe me when I say this: the romance is hardly even present. What little romance there is between Cas and Anna is forced and awkward. I only knew they were in love because I was told as much. There was no flirting. No longing glances. No blushing and looking away. No showing off. Now I can't even remember if there is any kissing. I think there might be a kissing scene, but the romance is so minor I just don't remember. The only things Cas and Anna had in common is both their fathers are dead and (view spoiler) [ their mothers are witches (hide spoiler) ] . Other than that, I can't think of anything else they might have in common. I would have loved to hear that they both liked the same subjects in school, read the same books, or even that they shared a deep passion for pie, but that never happened. Their conversations consisted of Cas questioning Anna about who killed her, the people she killed and how she feels about it, ghost killing, nightmares, and how to stop the gruesome murders happening in Thunder Bay. I don't know, maybe that's what passes for romance in Canada these days. The other romance is more interesting, in that it's an unconventional human pairing. I loves me an unconventional love story. That said, it's still another romance that's only present because we're told as much. Sure, Thomas the Nerd is crushing hard-core on Carmel, the hottest girl in school, but I fail to see why she might return his feelings. He's described as looking like a 12-year-old with unkempt orangey-red hair. He dresses ugly, he's awkward and he has a bit of a chip on his shoulder (which, by the way, conveniently disappears early on in the story). Yes, Thomas is nice to Carmel and worships the ground she walks on, but that's pretty much how everyone treats her. She's the hot girl, remember? So...what's in it for Carmel? I want to know that she finds him attractive on an intellectual level, or that it's his sense of humor and confidence that she finds irresistibly sexy (by the way, he's not funny but he needs to be because he is the plucky side-kick), or that she loves him because he really wants to be with her for her personality and not just her looks. It's not disgusting I'm not going to lie to you. All the gory details are vague at best. So if you're not into that sort of thing, don't worry, you're pretty safe. That said, I feel I should warn you: yes, there is some dismemberment, and, yes, it is a little abrupt when it happens the first time, but other than that... *shrug* I've actually seen worse (on tv). That. Just. Happened. Now please excuse me as I dry-heave for the next 30 seconds. Which brings me to my next point: I need the characters to show some genuine emotion Look, I know I just said that I've seen worse and that's why the gory descriptions didn't affect me. It's just that, had I seen someone dismembered IN REAL LIFE , I'd: 1) vomit 2) vomit some more 3) run away screaming 4) cry 5) dry-heave just thinking about it 6) have nightmares for the rest of my life 7) work it out in therapy. And that's what I'd do if I never even knew the person. These kids? Have never seen any real (read: not hallucinations) dismembered bodies, ever. So when they see it happen to people they actually know, I want them to do at least one of the following: 1) run away screaming 2) go into hysterics while standing there 3) go into shock 4) huddle in a corner 5) vomit 6) dry-heave 7) cry about it for more then a paragraph 8) have nightmares 9) call the cops 10) feel survivor guilt. None of that happened, which is why these teens seem so robotic. Also? I have a problem with the amount of time these kids spent on getting their stories straight. They spent more time working on alibis then they did thinking about the kids that died horrible, painful deaths. It's seriously disturbing how little they spent thinking about the dead kids or the dead kids' families. And don't tell me it doesn't really matter how they felt about the dead kids because they were bullies who deserved to die. It's called empathy. Look it up. (I have so much more to say but I don't know if I'll be able to finish this review before next week. I'm posting it now as a sort of early Thanksgiving present for everyone. You're welcome. Happy Thanksgiving!) ---- You can bet I have a lot to say about this book. I'll start working on a full review soon. Until then I feel I should mention that I am in the minority with this one. If you're thinking about reading this, go ahead and do so. Chances are you'll probably like it. If you also don't like this book leave a comment below so we can trash this book together. 1.5 stars.

This is one of those rare instances where everybody likes a book because it's actually good . I guess I wasn't paying much attention at first glance, mostly to avoid spoilers, but I was surprised that the protagonist was actually male . I thought Anna was the main character, but even though she's not this is still very much her story. Anna is terrifying. She doesn't fuck around and she doesn't take shit from anyone. She makes you feel sorry for her though, which at first seems like an impossible feat, and yet it definitely happens. It's the sign of a capable author who makes you sympathize with a character who literally tears people apart. Cas is the \"ghost hunter\" and reluctant hero of the story. He's definitely cocksure, but not annoyingly so. He doesn't whine, he doesn't act like an ass, and he doesn't make stupid decisions. Cas is one of the best young male protagonists I think I've ever come across. He's smart and knows his strengths and once he realizes he can't get his job done without the help of others, he accepts it and adapts. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 was because the rhythm of the story stuttered a bit around the halfway point. We're essentially given two climaxes, and after the first one receded I knew it was just a matter of time before the other shoe dropped. There's a scene just before the villain emerges that was probably one of the scariest parts of a book I've ever read, but unfortunately after reading that bit, nothing else could compare. I expected something equally terrifying when Cas finally came face to face with his adversary, but it just didn't happen. Not that the ending and final fight were bad , just that I wanted something more . Blake's writing is beautiful and incredibly lyrical. There were so many quotable passages that I wanted to type out almost a whole page for some of my updates. She writes realistic teenagers without relying on too many stereotypes and clich\u00e9s, and her characters form believable bonds unlike a lot of stories where a group of kids just randomly band together to save the day. There were casualties along the way, and I liked that I didn't see some of them coming. I also enjoyed the gore and gruesome bits, and I don't think it ever got to the point where someone would be offended or disgusted by some of the graphic violence. It's over quickly, at least, and she does balance the spookier parts with some well-placed humor throughout. I'm excited that she's writing a sequel to this story and I hope she writes other books and other series in the future. Anna and Cas are two of my favorite characters I've read about this year and I can't wait to see what's in store for them. It's so nice to finally read a paranormal young adult book that isn't absolute drivel. Bravo, Blake. Bravo. ...more Ughh. The first half of this book I would say was a solid 4/5. The second half, unfortunately, put me to sleep. 3/5 stars I guess to balance it out, but right now I feel that is even generous. When I went into this book I had zero expectations. I think ghosts are cool, and I was really just looking for something super creepy, because that was what I was in the mood for. I didn't even really have anything to compare this to, because I haven't read very many ghost books and have never watched any Ughh. The first half of this book I would say was a solid 4/5.

I didn't even really have anything to compare this to, because I haven't read very many ghost books and have never watched any kind of t.v. shows involving them either. Cas is a ghost hunter and he hates to be called a ghostbuster. lol He wants to avenge his father's death as he was killed by a ghost he was trying to hunt. First, though, he must kill Anna. Anna is a ghost of a girl who was brutally murdered in the 1950s. Anna is epic in my opinion. Cas has some friends to help him with Anna, but as he gets closer to killing her he finds himself starting to like her (wtf?) For me this is when the story just gets ridiculous. Some things I loved in this book were Cas and Anna. Not together. Cas was a pretty cool guy for the most part and I really liked him. Anna was awesome, and at some point I found myself really bored with the story and I was skipping ahead and reading only the parts with Cas and Anna talking. The rest of the school kids weren't that interesting at all. I really enjoyed Anna's back story. It reminded me of being 13 and telling ghost stories when I went camping with my friends, and sure it would have creeped me out for more back then, but it was still a great story. I felt really bad for her, and when everything was revealed about her death I was pretty shocked and pissed off. The bad thing here is that once Anna's story was revealed there were still lots of pages left in this book. Lots of boring pages if you ask me. I didn't really care to read much more about it, and I certainly did not want to read about the romance. It just seemed so silly. This book didn't have any good plot twists or anything intense you would normally expect from a book like this. Even the ending just kind of happened and left no impression on me. I think this book will be forgettable. This is book one of a series, and I can't say I'm excited to start book two as soon as it comes out. I might give it a try, because based on the beginning of the book the story has potential. I'm just afraid the rest is going to be a really bad paranormal romance and that would be disappointing. In short I wish she would have stuck with the horror aspect instead of trying to turn it into paranormal romance at the end. Had I known that was how it would be I would have passed on this book in the first place. I probably won't recommend this book to my friends, but I would tell anyone interested in it to give it a try, because there are lots of people who enjoyed this book. It just wasn't for me. ...more 2  stars Ho hum. I hate it when this happens.

I'm not sure why I couldn't get into this one, but I am willing to admit that it may be because I've just read a few amazing books in a row and everything else pales in comparison. But, I will try to explain my dissenting opinion about this one as best as I can. So here goes nothin. This whole book basically just made me wish I was watching an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Even Carmel helpfully brings it up at the end: Cas is Buffy, Thomas is Willow, and Carmel is Xander in a Cordelia suit. \u201cGideon\u201d I just went ahead and referred to as Giles for the entire book. And obviously, Anna is Angel. However, where BtVS had conflict and depth as Ms. Summers tried in vain to balance her life as a slayer of all things evil with her life as a teenage girl, this book has none. Cas doesn\u2019t have to worry about money, as his mom has a successful online business that easily travels from place to place. He doesn\u2019t have to worry about his mother, who is largely absent and only seems to appear sporadically to heal Cas and provide herbal cookies. She also seems totally fine with letting him go off every night to battle ghosts. He doesn\u2019t have to worry about his grades, as apparently the school he is enrolled in doesn\u2019t require that he do any work or attend classes. He doesn\u2019t have to worry about fitting in anywhere, because he has an endless supply of natural charm to pave his way. Cas says that he is a lone-wolf ghost hunter. The main struggle that he deals with is the struggle for real friendship and intimacy, something that he doesn\u2019t have in his life. However, he seems to come by allies and aid quite easily (and conveniently) whenever he needs them in this story. While I did like the interactions between Cas, Thomas, and Carmel, none of them feel three dimensional to me. Thomas is the shy awkward supernatural kid and Carmel is the Queen Bee of the school. Their friendship seems shallow and flat. And the romance is completely dull and instantaneous. (view spoiler) [Cas literally goes from witnessing Anna rip a boy in half to swooning over her in a matter of days. And I CANNOT believe that he\u2019s using the L-word by the end!!!! (hide spoiler) ] The relationship feels a smidge healthier than most PNR\u2019s (because they can essentially both kill each other at any time) but not by much. Anna is more complex than the stalkery vampire boyfriends, but she still has that inner core of violence and bloodlust that\u2019s somehow caged by looooooove. Nothing makes my eyes roll more than that, I\u2019m afraid. She can somehow hold it all in for Cas\u2026but everyone else? Dead. BUT, I did like Anna. She\u2019s the main reason that I kept reading this and didn\u2019t abandon it. I think that her history and motivations are very very interesting. I just wish that the romance part would go away. This book didn\u2019t make me laugh and it never made me scared. It definitely doesn\u2019t remind me of Hold Me Closer, Necromancer. Mainly, I just felt bored. Perfect Musical Pairing Slow Runner \u2013 Spooky Ghost This song has a young feel that reminds me a lot of Cas. And it\u2019s all about a spooky best friend...which is the relationship status that I wish could be applied to Anna and Cas. ...more But hey, at least we\u2019ll have this strange story to tell, love and death and blood and daddy-issues.

These said jerks take Cas to Anna's house and attempt to kill him. That doesn't go over too good for one of the guys as Anna comes out and protects Cas. So sweet :) Later on... Cas goes back to the house to talk to Anna. Yep, talk to the evil ghost that kills everything. But Cas knows there is something else going on with Anna, she doesn't really want to be a killer.

I can't imagine him turning into a serious, moody, broody boyfriend who believes in undying love (HA, geddit?)... but I've been proven wrong before. So please please please let Cas maintain his awesomeness in the sequel and steer clear of the angst. Because at the end of the day GhostGirl Angst is still Girl Angst. Sadness Scale. 8/10. Oh Anna.

The characters featured in this book are unique, well written, and are nothing typical. Blake was not afraid to break out of the norm having both tough and weak male characters, as well as female characters who are equally tough and weak. There are no minor characters. Everyone is equally important and none are more developed than others. Another really good feature of this book was that there was almost no focus on a love interest, and no weird drama. Most books now have some sort of drama between main characters that creates some sort of tension, however Anna Dressed In Blood was entirely focused on the plot and not on the useless side stories. Overall, I really loved the plot and concept of this book. A ghost, a tragic backstory, a haunted house and Canada as the main setting really sealed the deal on my love for this book. I definitely recommend it. ...more This was pretty good. It's perfect for people who want a light and easy paranormal read that happens to be a teen urban fantasy, rather than a teen urban fantasy that has paranormal elements. For me, that focus is key. I like ghost stories, and while this one isn't particularly scary, it does manage to be fun, full of magic, a bit of mystery, and interesting characters.

For those who have never seen the book, here you go: The next morning I turned over and stared into the eyes of horror and screamed so loud her Siamese cat vaulted off the bed and face-planted into the closed bedroom door. Good Times! Evil Kristin continued on her \"Pussification of Heather Tour\" throughout our teens. Her most binding \"prank\" was forcing me to watch The Shining. I recall her telling me she had watched it with her brother and it had a \"really sweet ending\". Everytime I would get up to use the bathroom, she would screech \"REDRUM, REDRUM!\" and I would usually haul ass back to the bed either slamming my toe into the bedpost or kneeing the dresser at full speed.It was well into my thirties before I would go alone to fill the ice bucket at a hotel. Anna Dressed in Blood regurgitated similar feelings in me but without the embarassing, teenage self-consciousness that always followed. Our fearless leader, Cas Lowood kills the dead that cannot cross over. Cas and his mother move from place to place ridding the towns of whatever evil spirit is wreaking havoc on it's citizens.They move to Thunder Bay, Ontario where the ghost of Anna Korlov is rumored to have slaughtered countless trespassers who have dared to seek refuge in the dilapidated house that she resides in. What follows is a freaky, sweet, endearing and at times, scary as FUCK horror story. As Cas has spent his life moving around, he struggles with creating attachments to his highschool friends and to Anna as well, because Anna is different than the rest of the ghosts he has killed. In spite of my obvious squeamishness to anything scary, I had a blast with this book. The characters were likeable, the dialogue was witty and well-written and the plot moved along seamlessly. I'm glad there is a sequel in the works as I would hate to think I wouldn't be hearing from Cas again. ...more 3.5 stars.

If you have\u2026 have you ever sided with the murderer? \u2018Cause in this book, the murderer is not necessarily the villain. This is what I liked about Anna dressed in Blood : it tells the story from a different perspective. Anna was brutally murdered during the 50s, while going to a school dance, and the perpetrator was never found. Cass is a teen ghost-hunter, a skill he has inherited from his father, also brutally murdered during a job. When Cass goes to Hunter Bay, Canada, to find Anna and banish her, he\u2019s in for a surprise. Anna is an incredibly strong and scary ghost who has killed a lot of innocent people, but she is also a victim, unwillingly obliged to act as she does by some mysterious power. Anna is, without a doubt, the shining star of the book. A great character, it\u2019s impossible not to feel heartbroken by what happened to her, when we learn how she became what she is. I have to give it to Kendare Blake that her spooky scenes\u2019 descriptions are extremely well done and so vivid and I am very glad this isn\u2019t a movie, or I wouldn\u2019t have slept for a century (awesome first scene with the hitchhiker, by the way). I don\u2019t usually read horror but this, I liked lot. There\u2019s tension, suspense, gore, gallons and gallons of blood, I swear I could hear Anna\u2019s dress dripping blood on the floor *shudders*. Hers alone is the merit for this book getting 3.5 stars from me. Cass is a different story. I got around to liking him in the end, but for a good part of the book the description that best fit him for me was \u201cpompous ass\u201d. What\u2019s with the aloofness \u201cI\u2019m more experienced and better than all of you, mere mortals?\u201d True, he made me crack up in more than one occasion with his witty, sarcastic remarks but mostly, he managed irritated me. Too full of himself. I was also slightly creeped out by the fact that he falls in love with a corpse\u2026 but wait, she\u2019s not a corpse, she\u2019s a ghost. Then why are ghosts in this book corporeal, yet they can disappear into thin air? How do you tell a ghost from a person? I don\u2019t know why I was disturbed by this \u2013 after all, vampires are dead too \u2013 yet I was. Might be because she was not exactly your garden variety girl-next-door while in killing mode, who knows. Thomas and Carmel \u2013 but Cass\u2019s mother, Morfran and Will, too \u2013 did not really come alive for me (huh, no pun intended), I felt there could have been a bit more character development there and there would have been a bit less eye-rolling from my part. For example, I nearly threw the book when Cass goes to call Thomas for the summoning spell but since he\u2019s canoodling with Carmel he goes away, leaving them undisturbed. What?! Making out is more important than saving the day? Gimme a break, Cass. Still, Anna dressed in Blood was a lot of fun to read and pretty original too (even though the author could have avoided one of the various tropes of YA paranormal by leaving out the unnecessary and pre-packed romance, in my opinion), leaving us with an open end but no brutal cliffhanger. I\u2019m definitely interested in picking up the sequel to this and I want to beg the author to \u2013 pretty please! \u2013 not make it unnecessarily cheesy.

I also loved how the author went beyond the usual YA and made it more graphic; more horrific. It really gives you the creeps! I love my horror, this was 100% a book for me, and the author did a great job. Kendare knows how to tell a story, and tell it well. I didn't think it was over the top, but I could still see myself getting nightmares from this story. She gives us enough details to make us experience it - which considerably adds to the creep factor. There were a few minor traits that bothered me though. Mostly, it's the reaction of the characters that were often unconvincing: Anna, who is scary as heck, attacks and almost kills Carmel, and all she says is \"My god, she's awful\".. yeah.. a little... \"You forgot about the bad part. You know, the part where we have to get Anna inside the circle and throw chicken feet at her.\" Another noteworthy aspect in this novel is the humour that is mixed in with the horror. Cas is funny and witty even in the worst situations. He knows his stuff, but he also sounds his age. This makes it all very easy to get into the story. Ultimately, this is pure horror it's its finest form. If this wasn't enough to convince you to read it, just look at that cover and title.

Now tha Anna Dressed in Blood has been brought to you by: Why use tap water for witchcraft spells when you can use Dasani\u00ae? Full disclosure: I approached Anna Dressed in Blood with a great amount of trepidation. After all, it\u2019s patently obvious that I am not a fan of teenage supernatural romances. My track record speaks for itself and I am clearly not the demographic at whom this market is aimed. Teens swooning over creatures that can kill them has, for all intents and purposes, been played out. Now that Kendare Blake has added ghosts to the oeuvre, I\u2019m hoping we can hammer the final nail in the coffin and move on to something new for teens to swoon over. Sarcastic talking woodland animals? Obscure shoegazer bands from the early 1990s? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m brainstorming here. At any rate, Blake has set herself apart from the pack with Anna Dressed in Blood , an incredibly creepy and gory horror story. In fact, it\u2019s far more horrific than it is romantic. Cas is following in his deceased father\u2019s footsteps: he hunts and kills murderous ghosts, using an athame - a knife that sends the spirit to a peaceful (and presumably non-murderous) afterlife. Both Cas\u2019 caustic personality and his approach to the craft of ghost-killing is beautifully fleshed out in the first chapter. Blake effectively strings together Cas' process without over-explaining or sensationalizing her character\u2019s motives. He kills ghosts. Period. Take it or leave it. Cas learns of a particularly brutal ghost (our titular Anna) who has claimed an extraordinary number of lives in the small town of Thunder Bay, and who wields such unwavering power that no one has left her house alive. In fact, her victims tend to be ripped apart limb to limb. Don\u2019t allow logic to question how so many bodies can pile up without any suspicion on behalf of local law enforcement. Just enjoy the rising action. Arriving in Thunder Bay, Cas meets Thomas (a teenage psychic!), Carmel (a Queen Bee!), Mike (Carmel\u2019s jealous ex-boyfriend!), and two of Mike\u2019s meathead buddies. One of these characters is immediately dispensed by Anna after an ill-advised visit to her house. It\u2019s a shocking kill, and despite Anna\u2019s rather derivative entrance (it reeks of J-Horror favesie The Grudge ), Blake further establishes herself as a no-holds barred author. She is not going to dither around. There will be blood. And lots of it. After this casualty, Cas finds himself in the midst of more than just a murdering ghost: there is something different about Anna, and he resolves to uncover the truth. And, okay. Maybe he wants to make out with her, too. So yeah. Spoiler . Cas falls for Anna. And that\u2019s where the book sorta started to lose me. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I knew it was coming. It just seemed a little far-fetched, especially after Cas has established himself as a rather singular fellow. He\u2019s a loner. A rebel, Dottie. Killing ghosts is what he does, and he doesn\u2019t have the time to make nice and be all buddy-buddy with the goons he goes to school with. Maybe that\u2019s why Anna is so perfect for him? And maybe that\u2019s what makes their first kiss so gross on so many levels? It\u2019s really pointless reading too much into this kinda stuff. It's far too goofy to even begin entertaining analyses. The truth is this, though: Anna Dressed in Blood is quite good. Blake has a wicked way with words and she is a master of tension, suspense, and truly gross murders. The book is a fairly fast read despite some pacing problems... and an even bigger problem. A really big problem . Are we entering an era of corporate sponsorship in novels? I flat-out refuse to believe that Blake didn\u2019t receive money from Coca-Cola every time she wrote the word Dasani . It is one thing to write \u201cCoke\u201d in a book; it\u2019s become a universal term for caffeinated, carbonated beverages. But Cas\u2019 buddy Thomas doesn\u2019t use tap water or even bottled water. He uses Dasani . And Dasani is mentioned at least eight times in the final one-hundred pages. I mean... really . This is what we've come to? This? Americans (and probably the world) are already bombarded by advertisements from major soul-sucking corporations, but our literature has been relatively free of forcible brand-namedropping (unless, of course, it\u2019s intentional conspicuous consumerism a l\u00e1 The Clique or Gossip Girl ). Bottled water is bottled water - except in the '80s when the concept was relatively new and monopolized by Evian. We scoffed at bottled water Evian then. Anyway, I rarely read the sequels to books, and I have no intentions of continuing this series. There's too much else to read. But I ask a favor: someone will need to let me know if the Dasani binge is continued. Or if another brand has been picked up. Then I can begin a crusade against the corporatization of literature, teen or otherwise. What a crusade it will be. ...more Ghosts scare the crap outta me.

The author weaved it all together perfectly to make it hard to put it down,. Plus making it not feel like a YA book was another plus. Cas Lowood at a young age took the mantle his father left behind hunting ghosts. With the death of his father by a ghost, Cas has made it his mission to kill what needed to stay in the ground, with his white witch mother, he travels around seeking ghosts, and perhaps one day kill the ghost that killed his father. In his latest mission puts him up against a spirit of a young girl who was killed in 1958, many call Anna Dressed in Blood. Cas is surprised not to find a normal ghost, but a young girl trapped and bound by a long ago curse with powers he\u2019s never seen before something inside of him that draws him closer to her- even more so when she spared his life... I\u2019ve really come to enjoy and even seek out male POV books, I feel it gives the author and the reader a different, and perhaps another outlook- plus it\u2019s plain fun.. Cas is not not only a wonderful character, but his voice and thoughts drew me in.While he had a lot riding on his shoulders, still ended up being and acting like a teen, sullen, a little emo, angst and could be a asshat. These flaws made him even more understandable and relatable to the reader instead of being all perfect hair, perfect skin, badass, he was very much at the core a human being and a teen just growing up in something no one could imagine. When Cas receives word about Anna, something makes him feel drawn to her right from the start even when getting hit over the head by a 2x4 by a jealous football player in the house Anna hunts and half out of it, when Cas first sees Anna with her bloody dress, - his \u201cDeath Goddness\u201d he's even made more curious about her when instead of ripping his guts out, attacks the dumb football who attacked him and spares Cas\u2019s life in the process. Cas returns time and again to Anna, seeking to know more about her. Anna is shown not to be the scary ghost but a young girl stuck, cursed and no way out. The story progresses in a time of mist, where your expect something to jump out at you any second. The author breathes life into every bit of the story as Cas grows from being the loner to having something he has always wanted, but never dreamed he could- friends from Thomas the outsider who has a few tricks a gifts up his sleeve to Camel the \u201cit\u201d girl at school who has a lot of heart and place to stay and love from someone other then his mother. There\u2019s a lot of nice twists,the pace does somewhat faultier toward the end with a almost power healing, quick fix for Anna to a dump of romance that felt a little out of place. Of course there were a few unanswered questions and left for the sequel to pick up. ADIB never read like a YA, while I\u2019ve read my share of YA books, you tend to feel where the focus age group lays, not so in ADIB with an all around older age group to enjoy.

Thesius Casio Lowood but more favorably known as Cas has inherited his fathers skills of killing the dead along with his athame; a knife tied to his blood primarily used for killing the dead. I know that sounds a bit odd, how does he kill a ghost if they're already dead? Well apparently some ghosts are oblivious to fact that they truly are dead, and often they stay in the place of their death, overwhelmed with the rage of their murder's bloodlust encouraging them to kill innocent people against their will. Cas travels across the world with his fathers athame, his mother and her cat in the hopes of saving lives by killing the dead. He's a high school senior by day and ghost killer by night. Since his fathers death ten years ago he has studied and prepared himself for his most important ghost killing ever; his fathers killer. However before he attempts to avenge his fathers murder he must kill Anna. Anna Dressed in Blood will be his most prolific kill yet, and Cas knows that if he can kill Anna he can kill anything. Beautiful Anna in the white dress that constantly drips blood was murdered in 1958 and since that date she has murdered every person that has even attempted to step foot in her deserted Victorian House she was murdered in. \"But she, for whatever reason, spares his life.\" \"I wish you would leave,\" she says softly, and when she looks up I see that she's almost crying. \"You know I can't,\" I say, mirroring her words from moments ago. \"You make me want things that I can't have.\" Cas gains two unlikely friends that prove to be loyal and dependable. Beautiful Carmel is the teachers pet, the homecoming queen, and party central all wrapped into one. Originally Cas befriended her on the first day of school because she would know all the Anna gossip he was eager to learn in preparation of killing Anna. Charismatic and intoxicatingly smooth Cas finds it easy to make friends with popular females. Along the way Carmel and Cas become true friends and gather support from one another while maintaining the Common goal of killing Anna. Thomas eager to seek a friendship with Cas is his complete opposite with his black-rimmed glasses, ragged black hair and skinny lanky body. Together these three form an unlikely team of teenage ghost hunters or against Cas' wishes present day GhostBusters. Kendare Blake took me along a spooky ride that I didn't ever want to get off.

Intrigued, Cas packs up the family and his treasured knife to go on a slice and dice mission, only to fall in lurrrve with his ghostly paramour. Similarities to the TV show Supernatural notwithstanding, I thought this was a decent read. It was action packed and creepy. Some scenes, such as the car scene with the hitchhiker and, later on, the basement scene gave me major goose bumps. The circumstances that kept Anna in the house were well written. You can't help but feel some sympathy for her, and despite her murderous tendencies, she was the most likeable character in the book. However, there were some shortcomings that prevented the fourth star: 1. A protagonist that's way full of himself. Yeah, I understand: you kill undead things, you carry around a knife, and you're attractive. But you can be all those things without being kind of a jerk. There is a fine line between confidence and cockiness, and Cas crossed over that line quite a few times. 2. Underdeveloped supporting cast. I never really got the point of Thomas and Caramel's inclusion in the series. It just seemed that they got pushed aside in favor of Cas and Anna's romance. 3. Is it just me or is the part where Anna spared Cas never fully explained? Other than the fact that (view spoiler) [Cas had a good heart (hide spoiler) ] , I didn't catch on why he didn't get ripped apart. If I missed something, I would really appreciate an explanation. Overall, 2.5 to 3 stars for decent writing and storytelling. If you're a horror fan that enjoys sprinklings of romance, I recommend this book.

Loved the horror! I've never read any horror, really, so this was SO much fun! But not only that.. I loved the plot, the characters, the themes.. AWESOME! :) I really just want more of this book. More of these characters. Just more. I couldn't get enough of them. I loved the unexpected twists and turns this book took. I loved the bravery of the characters. I wasn't too fond of the gore, but if you like gore and scary things, you will love this book. Or, if you just like a book where characters fit together in a fascinating way and you want to skip the gory bits, you can do that too. So I read it again and I still enjoyed it. Especially Anna.

She's so BADASS. I kind of wish there was one more book in this series, just because I loved how these characters got alone so much. They were just such good friends. ...more", "Title": "Anna Dressed in Blood"},
