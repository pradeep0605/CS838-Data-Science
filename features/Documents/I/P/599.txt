The point is, however, that it was marvelous. I've been trying to write this review for days. I'm not sure why I find it so difficult to explain why I find something so enjoyable, but for whatever the reason I do. Ask me why I don't like something, I can write you a list a mile long, but describe why I like it.... I just do that's why! It could be Sophie, the main character. She is just an enjoyable protagonist. She's caring, open-minded, a good friend, and she might be a little gullible at times, but that is what makes her so great. She isn't a perfect character, she makes mistakes and we get to laugh at her for it! Well sometimes. Maybe it was the plot. I will admit at times it was a little predictable, but it was never slow. And I might have thought I knew what was going on, but Hawkin's really threw me for a loop. I'm sure it will leave you craving the next novel as much as I am. Then again it was probably the writing. Simplistic and addicting. I might not be able to vividly express why I thought it was amazing, but it just was. I'm so very much looking forward to the next novel and more of Sophie's adventure. ...more OK, I originally gave this 3.5 stars.. but I have decided just to give it 4 stars. \u201cI\u2019m experiencing some teenage angst, Mrs Casnoff,\u201d I answered. \u201cI need to, like, write it in my journal or something.\u201d Initial Final Page Thoughts.

Ms Hawkins\u2019 deliciously wicked sense of humour. Low Points. Yeah, I\u2019m morally opposed to faeries. And characters being jammed into restrictive stereotypes\u2026. LET THEM SOAR. Heroine. I loved Sophie and I could really relate to her because I have magical powers , I canoodle with warlocks on a regular basis , she\u2019s such a massive goon. She was so useless and awkward and unaware of herself and goofy and sarcastic and she was such a refreshing narrator because she seemed really\u2026 well, real. So many books that I (<---B>and my friends!</---B>) read are completely saturated with AFPs who are so simpering and vomit-inducing and they get so angry and frustrated because they didn\u2019t ask to be so heart-stoppingly beautiful and have all these boys fall over themselves to be with them. Gaaaaaah. So, when Sophie exploded onto the page with her delinquent paranormal ways, her refreshing humour (a perfect vessel for Ms Hawkins\u2019 gentle ribbing of the genre, no clich\u00e9 is safe around her!) and boob sweat, it was like taking a breath of fresh air. Although, I wasn\u2019t impressed by her opposition to freckles. What in the world is wrong with freckles?! \u201cSo, I have a destiny,\u201d I said. \u201cCrap.\u201d Titter. Yes, sometimes Sophie\u2019s sass and smart-arse comments bordered on a bit much\u2026 but if she toned that down just a tad, I imagine we\u2019d be best friends forever and sit up all night eating delicious snacks and chortling over her being a witch and having sexy men fawning over her and how it was so cute that I was completely ordinary and stuck with the bad dog in cargo shorts and his excessive slobber. OH, HOW WE WOULD CHORTLE. Love Interest. Well, in the beginning I could take Archer or leave him. Sure, he was pretty (\u201c So you think I\u2019m pretty?\u201d ), and clever and funny and a bit of a wild boy (WILD BOYS\u2026.sorry my Duran Duran references are a knee-jerk reaction now\u2026 or you could say a Reflex. Ohhh yeah) and he was a massive douche to Sophie but then, wait, he\u2019s actually secretly nice and loves herjsaq9ijecdjksla;sohdfio02eidjfvsn\u2026 sorry I just fell asleep. Yeah, he was fine\u2026. He coasted. He was on my radar but he wasn\u2019t making any waves. That was until the end when he suddenly got much more interesting. And ripped, apparently. He\u2019d been keeping that secret under his scruffy blazer and un-tucked shirt, wasn\u2019t he?! And then we have Cal, who isn\u2019t necessarily a love interest in this book but I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s going to lope into the sequel with his plaid shirt and his axe and his rippling pectorals and his inevitable dark and brooding past that Sophie finds mysterious and intriguing. But, yeah\u2026 I\u2019ve not worked out how he\u2019ll feature in the sequel yet. It\u2019s got me completely betrothed baffled. Best Friend. Lesbian vampire. Um, LOVE IT. Jenna was fantastic and, although Sophie was sometimes a bit unnecessarily cruel to her (Um, wallowing in self-pity?! I\u2019d like to see you try going through what Jenna did, Miss Mercer!), I liked the easy and natural sounding dynamic the two of them had. I have to admit when she came out of the coffin my eyes did begin to roll and my lips began to curl, my natural reaction to vampires. But I needn\u2019t have worried because Jenna was actually a decent vamp and kick-ass unlike so many of her un-dead chums. Theme Tune. OK, when I first picked up this book I was all smitten and smug (smuggen?) because I had already chosen THE BEST SONG for this book. But then Ms Hawkins with her devious twists and turns (which I will not divulge) completely blew that out of the water. So I thought I was snookered. But then I thought, no. Because I love this song and it is perfect for seducing unsuspecting warlocks in a basement this book\u2026. Until it\u2026 well\u2026 wasn\u2019t. Witchy Woman by Eagles Angst Level. 4/10. This book is relatively tame in the angst level. Sure there are a few bits that are borderline grim, but this book is mainly a one-way ticket to FUN TOWN. (That\u2019s right, FUN TOWN) And it was really refreshing to just sit back and take in the view. Although\u2026 I gather the sequel is going to be a lot darker. And that\u2019s just fine by me. Recommended For. People who want to book a one-way ticket to FUN TOWN. OK, I promise that that\u2019s the last time I\u2019m going to say that\u2026 it\u2019s actually making me cringe. People who are looking for a new fictional best friend that will make them realise how boring and ordinary their lives are. People who have always thought their world would end when their acceptance letter to Hogwarts got lost in the post\u2026 don\u2019t worry, Hex Hall will take anyone. People who would be able to think of witty responses to a werewolf lunging for your jugular. People who are sick of others being suspicious when they ask them to join their secret coven. People who immediately think of singing Pocahontas songs when they\u2019re outdoors. People who will always lust after the groundskeeper. People who wish their detentions had been that fun\u2026 mmmhmmm. People who maintain that boys who are rude/arrogant/downright nasty are just that way because they are completely and secretly besotted with you. It\u2019s true. Right? People who wish their stoopid school had had a prom so they could wear beautiful dresses and get their hair done all fancy\u2026 we did get to go to Alton Towers though, which was amazing and didn\u2019t end with a gabiilion girls crying in formal wear, which I imagine happens a lot at proms. Although, I probably would have more luck finding a prom date than finding someone to go on Air for the third time in a row. Wimps . ...more Rating: 2.5 stars Meet Mean Girls, witch edition.

We even have a \u201cI love your bracelet\u201d moment when Elodie and The Plastics make Sophie tell their teacher she loves her tats. Too bad her teacher did not love them as much as Sophie did. Writing: 4/10 Plot: 4/10 Characters: 3/10 Fun: 5/10 How I expected this book to go: After a spell gone wrong, Sophie is sent to exile at a boarding school for Prodegium. As secrets unravel, and new threats appear, she has to find a way to stop mysterious killings without being the next target herself. And a passage from the description itself: \u201cAs a series of blood-curdling mysteries starts to converge, Sophie prepares for the biggest threat of all: an ancient secret society determined to destroy all Prodigium, especially her.\u201d \u201cSophie prepares for the biggest threat of all\u201d ... biggest threat of all ...... In all honesty the biggest threat she suffered was her crush not liking her back and social suicide. This was, what the author focused on after all. Plot: \u201cbut how about the threats?\u201d \u201cthe killings?\u201d \u201cthe fighting?\u201d \u201cAnything other than angst?\u201d This book was honestly: 80% Teenage angst, 18% I'm just writing this as I go, and finally 2% badassery. There's a moment where the MC is told she's the most powerful witch and her instinct is to go off and cry about it. She thinks about how unfair her circumstances are and questions why it has to be her. Oh and let me tell you about the cringe worthy crush \u201cgirly moment\u201d where she talks about how she's falling for Aaro-Archer, I meant Archer. She knows she's not supposed to, after all: In this case the enemy\u2019s/Elodie's I feel like I've become accustomed to books with more angst/romance than plot which is why I gave it a 2.5. Also I was still interested in what may happen in the next book since it didn't really lead anywhere in this one. It's more of a fun read than anything else since it's light. Overall thoughts: (I'm sorry if you don't understand any of the references! Just think of it as the typical high school cliche) Honestly the writing wasn't bad, I only had problems with the characters themselves. ...more Fun! This book really grew on me. It took several tries to get past the first couple of chapters, but once Sophie finally gets settled in at Hex Hall things start moving along. The witchy battles are pretty cool, there's good build-up of the mystique behind the school and behind Sophie's past and powers, and the author does a nice job with creating a variety of different characters with distinctive voices.

It did take me a little while to get used to the author's voice, but the humor actually gets to be really good as the story develops and I've gone back to giggle over certain passages again. Overally, this is a really terrific debut and a fast-paced, entertaining read. It's always a plus when a YA author manages to surprise her audience with twists and turns in the plot too, and there are a couple of really good ones here that will leave readers on the edge for more. Besides...you can't not love a girl who tries to stop an attacking werewolf by yelling, \"BAD DOG!\" ...more As to date, this has been one of the most enjoyable fantasy books I\u2019ve read that deals with otherworldly creatures like witches, vampires, faes, werewolves, shape-shifters and demons (collectively called as Prodigium) through the author\u2019s creative effort of putting them all together in one monster high called Hecate Hall or simply Hex Hall.

Or probably not. Lol! It\u2019s very enjoyable because the heroine is funny, witty and sarcastic. Exactly my kind of gal! She doesn\u2019t care so much about her appearance. She also knows how to properly appreciate other people\u2019s beauty without a tinge of jealousy. The narration and dialogue are delightful and easy to read. \u201c'I'm experiencing some teenage angst\u2026I need to, like, write in my journal or something.\" The events are fast-paced and very interesting. The author manipulated these fantastic characters pretty well and created interesting conflicts and twists although personally, I think the plot could use a bit more action. But this is only the first book of the series, so I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be a lot of those in the sequel. This is highly recommended especially for young readers (or even old) looking for a light, enjoyable fantasy read. ...more Meh. Meh Meeeeeeh. Mehhhhhhh. Meh. Meh. (view spoiler) [Meh. Meh. Meh. Meh.

Young adult fantasy and urban fantasy seems to have been constantly churning out more of the same, but Hex Hall really ticked all the right boxes for me. Granted, a boarding school for witches and whatnot isn't exactly original and it's a hard field to compete in when you're up against the likes of J.K.Rowling , but I liked Hawkins' laid back and kind of chick-lit style writing. The novel reminded me of something in between Vampire Academy and this TV show that I used to love when I was a kid called 'The Worst Witch', maybe I'm wrong but I'd be willing to bet that not many people outside of the UK have heard of it. Anyway, you basically have all you expect from a regular high school: bullies, bitchiness, crushes, dating, school dances, etc. But then you also have the added trouble that comes with supernatural creatures and magical powers: killers on the loose, demons being summoned, bullies that can turn you into a slug... I won't say that I expected to hate it, but I did expect to be bored. I never imagined there would be moments that made me laugh out loud and annoyingly stereotypical bad boys that are actually hot enough to get away with being annoyingly stereotypical bad boys. Yes, you heard me right: another young adult novel with another hot but dangerous male love interest... but this time I completely loved it. Maybe my mid-life crisis came early but I thought Archer was really hot. If I'd been at Hex Hall I know I would have both hated and wanted to be with him at the same time. I think I liked him most because he had a sense of humour and didn't say really stupid cliched phrases like \"I'm wrong for you because I'm so badass\" - okay, maybe it doesn't quite go like that but I hate literary heroes that believe they're so bad that they've earned the right to apologise for it. Ugh. My point: Archer wasn't like that. The mystery was alright but it wasn't my favourite bit; the novel's strength was in the characters and the dialogue, not in the plot behind it all. Basically: someone died, someone was accused, real culprit was found out... the end. Probably was what stopped me from giving it 5 stars, my full marks demand a better story. But what the heck, it was fun, I enjoyed it a lot, and I now have every intention of reading Demonglass . ...more I really liked Archer but I wasn't very drawn into the plot or the main character. The author has a fun, fast-paced writing style that is easy to follow and plenty of humor to go around, but I was not a fan of the cliff-hanger ending for a first book in a series. I will get around to the sequel at some point but this is one of my more light-hearted fantasy reads. I think it would have been a hit for my middle school self:) Well this is just the same old tired format for paranormal YA boarding school romps. I've seen the same story time and time again in books like Secret Lives , Evernight , Firespell , and it is just boring me. 1)misfit teen sent to boarding school 2)she doesn't want to be there 3)gets on wrong side of popular bitches on day one 4)instant crush on sexiest guy at school 5)her only friend is a fellow misfit 6)grim teachers 7)obnoxious students 8)murderer on the loose The characters are either obnoxious muppets or Well this is just the same old tired format for paranormal YA boarding school romps.

The teachers don't seem to give a damn about discipline-explain to me why the werewolf who attacked Sophie on her first minute on campus got no punishment? Is attempted murder seen as acceptable at this school? The only one who was given a stern talking to was the guy who saved Sophie by using magic to protect her from the werewolf! Strange moral code from the head teacher don't you think? As usual in these books, the kids do what the hell they like with the teachers ignoring them, which defeats the whole purpose of the school in my opinion. These kids are sent to this school because they can't control their power so surely they should be watched closely!!! I hate stupid plots like this. *sigh* I think it's time to give up on these cloned books and pick up a proper urban fantasy book with a decent story and characters that don't bug me to death. ...more HEX HALL is an insanely fun, hilarious, and HOT book! I can't even tell you how many times I laughed out loud (or had to put the book down because I was laughing so hard)! Sophie Mercer is now officially one of my favorite heroines and I just might be a little bit in love with Archer Cross, too. :) I can't say enough wonderful things about this book, only that you need to pick it up ASAP when it debuts next March.

YA now is like college you, all grown-up and cringing at the occasional photo of your tween self that pops up on Facebook. Hex Hall is juvenile YA. The writing is a more inane version of Meg Cabot 's style, filled with cutesy internal monologues and pop culture references. The plot is an typical mystery type without much punch. And the girl hate. God , the girl hate. \"I turned and saw Chaston, Anna and Elodie walking toward me. They looked amazing in the fugly gym uniforms. Shocker.\" Unlike Tina Fey's masterpiece, the girls don't make up and sing kumbaya. I thought it was heading that direction for a while and was sadly let down. (view spoiler) [Elodie turns out to be a power-hungry bitch after all. Yeah, sure, she passes Sophie her powers in the end. Cry me a river. (hide spoiler) ] In the acknowledgements, it surprisingly states Hex Hall is mostly about the power of women. What power? The power to tear each other down? \"Even her essay for Lord Byron's class was about the way physical beauty enhanced a witch's power, supposedly because it gave her easier access to humans. It was ridiculous.\" No, it's smart . Ethics aside, it's a damn good tactic. The feminism in Hex Hall reminds me of this movie I watched recently: White Chicks. (I know, it's been out for over a decade, but I wasn't interested until I saw a gif of one of the protagonists telling the other to hold his poodle, so he can beat someone up). It's not devoid of female bonding\u2014Sophie and Jenna's relationship was nicely done\u2014but it relies on knocking down other women to build the home team up. In White Chicks, it's the fake Wilson sisters and their friends against the spoiled heiresses who are willing to sleep their way onto the catwalk. In Hex Hall, it's Sophie and Jenna against the witches' coven who are obsessed with power and their looks. I'm sure you're all tired of me banging on about feminism, but it's something I unconsciously look for when I read. I weigh other factors too obviously\u2014plot, pace, characters, the realistic aspect, etc, but gender equality is up there. If a book is awesome enough, I can overlook certain aspects, like Six of Crows 's arguably archetypal ending (view spoiler) [of a hero needing to rescue his girl.

Then viselike fingers clenched my throat, the stake was wrenched from my hand, and a sharp stabbing pain shot up my right thigh as I landed on the ground with a thump that knocked the breath out of me.\u201d However, It was full of unnecessary parts and some characters were not well explored. There were people (or monsters) that were really well introduced and they never appeared again. Or were just a cameo in the corner of the story. I also expected more from the professors. Not a Minerva McGonagall kind of development, but something. There were also things told over and over again, like the reader didn't get it the first time. And the second. And the third... So, as all normal schools, at Hecate there were also evil bitches, I mean, witches. Sophie is called to the \"coven\" but... You know. We also get the hate-love plot as a bonus and things happens... And FINALLY, at the end of second half, the book starts for me. Archer is still far away from my head. He still bothers me and how he was described, with all his hotness... I don't know, it was just too lame. I'm actually more interested in Cal... And we get action!!! And the plot twist, even though it's not THAT good, it's still really interesting. I wasn't expecting the end and all the mystery got me by surprise. That really increased my ratings. So yes, I recommend this book but be aware of the laziness in the beginning and all the teen feelings. \"Sorry, sorry.

The main problem with books like this is that you don't know how to rate them. You loved it so much because it's funny and with magic, but you know that it's a simple book too. A short book that in a way doesn't tell anything particular. This is the way I feel about this book. I liked it a lot, but it wasn't a masterpiece. Anyway, Sophie is one of the most funny characters I read about. I mean, only Gwendolyn from Rubinrot , Saphirblau and Smaragdgr\u00fcn is funnier than her xD I lo 4.5 Super duper cute!

[...] \"Mm-hmm,\" Jenna agreed. \"Anything else?\" \"I have a crush on Archer Cross.\" Jenna laughed. \"How original of you.\" Apart from the simple story, what didn't convince me was the school thing. At the beginning it reminded me of Night School that I didn't like even a bit. I don't know why, but these schools that are not well organized don't strike me in a good way. In conclusion, I think that even with this negative aspects this is a very good book, and I can't wait to read the next one! ...more My main impression from the book is that it's meant for the very bottom of the age spectrum it's being marketed for. I'd say 10-14 years old because the writing is extremely simplistic. Of course, there's a lot of dead teenagers flying around so it's a weird mix of older, more mature themes and fairly immature writing. The world building is so-so.

The book tosses a lot of cliches in a blender and while you're perfectly aware you're being served every paranormal plot device ever it still goes down smoothly enough. I wouldn't recommend it to adults who like reading the genre. I'm giving my copy to the teenage girl who lives next door. ...more Harry Potter : Magic Castle. Forbidden forest.

When I find my feelings about a book I\u2019m reading are on the \u201cmeh\u201d side, I tend to lose focus easily. I space out and take a lot of reading breaks. Sometimes the result of those distractions is a complete crap gif-filled mess instead of a review. Sophie was just trying to cast a love spell that would make the quarterback ditch his cheer captain date and take the most unpopular girl at school from zero to hero. Unfortunately, the spell worked a little too well . . . That failed attempt at witchcraft is the final straw for Sophie\u2019s (human) mother and absentee (warlock) father. Sophie now has to finish her schooling at Hecate Hall, a reform school for Prodigium who can\u2019t keep their powers under wraps. Upon her arrival, Sophie meets some mean girls who want her to join their coven but she\u2019s not so sure they are the type of girls she wants to be associated with Rather than joining a clique of bitches witches, Sophie befriends her roommate Jenna \u2013 a vampire who is believed to have killed a former student. Sophie doesn\u2019t believe Jenna could be a murderer, but when additional students start being attacked \u2013 with two holes on their neck, no less - it seems there is indeed a blood drinker of sorts on the loose. (That image is for all the ladies. You\u2019re welcome.) The story gets a little convoluted as it jumps from mystery solving to every day teenage witch activity (complete with some broomstick riding and spell learning) to really normal teenage behavior like getting super stoked about the upcoming All Hallows Eve Ball where the girls\u2019 dream dresses seem to have been inspired by \u201cMy Big Fat Gypsy Wedding\u201d All in all this wasn\u2019t a terrible book, but I\u2019m not a fan of book series in general and I\u2019m really not a fan of reading 323 pages where 200+ probably could have been cut and combined with book #2. I continue to cross my fingers in hopes this trend will pass and authors will only be signed to produce one book at a time. Hopefully the result will be books that aren't always soooooooo open ended. Off topic: In my quest to hunt down what seems to be every witch-related picture/gif on the interwebs, I discovered a couple of things. First, Nicole Kidman has really jacked her face up with surgery/botox/whatever. Second, I need to watch \u201cThe Witches of Eastwick\u201d again (and hot diggity dog was Susan Sarandon smoking hot in that movie). ...more I would like to thank Ate AJ and Ate Rachel for recommending this book to me.

When a spell gone bad, a young witch Sophie Mercer was sent to Hecate Hall (Hex Hall) as a punishment of exposing herself to humans. Students consists of young Prodigium or supernatural creatures like vampires, werewolves, fairies, witches etc. Things happened when there are mysterious attacks towards the students and they think Jenna (Sophie's vampire roommate) is responsible for these attacks. Sophie doesn't believe in it and she's about to find out. The setting somewhat reminds me of Harry Potter and the Hex Hall's history made me curious. It's pretty interesting and I want to know more. Sophie Mercer is such a fascinating character. She's witty, hilarious and sarcastic at its best. This lady made me laugh out loud. As for other characters, all of them are interesting. Especially Archer Cross. Oh how I love this bad boy warlock. Lastly, the plot twist in this book is something I didn't expect. I was like \"WHOA! Now, that is one good twist!\" What a great surprise.

I'd look like the really slutty bride of Cookie Monster. The secondary characters were also pretty great. How could I not love a lesbian friend in a mainstream YA novel... I can't, I must love her. Three cheers for diversity! And Archer is such an adorable boy to crush on (even if that makes me a touch pervy). What kept this book from being a great read was that it was a bit too slow for my tastes. It wasn't spooky enough, or dangerous enough... it just wasn't enough for me. The pace dragged at the beginning and the excitement came too little too late for my tastes. However, I'm excited that I have another YA paranormal to get behind! ...more Simpatico, semplice, divertente e dinamico. Questo \u00e8 il libro adatto per staccare la spina, per rilassarsi.

To be fair, Hecate/Hex Hall was more of a lazy derivation of Hogwarts than an effort to be in the same league. I suspect any other attempt at imagining a school in the context of Fantasy will be branded as such and this smartly capitalized on its presumed strengths in other areas. Unfortunately, this felt like it placed all its eggs in the charm and humor basket instead of saving some for the character development and a creative, original storyline. Sophie Mercer has been to nineteen high schools across the country for causing trouble with her magical interventions. Her last one gets her shipped to Hecate \u201cHex\u201d Hall, a reformative school of sorts for the wayward young Prodigium (witches, warlocks, shifters, fae and a vampire) where she\u2019s off to learn pertinent things like dress design by magic, literature from Lord Byron (the real one) and self defense because her kind is being hunted by an Irish family and an Italian cult of hunters who has a thing for eye tattoos. And maybe even defend herself from her vampire roommate who may or may not be killing the witches in school one by one. Unlike some of the recent smart-ass heroines I\u2019ve encountered, I didn\u2019t find Sophie as annoying as I expected. But I wasn\u2019t charmed by her either. In more ways than one, she\u2019s very Anne Hathaway circa Princess Diaries kind of funny here: I know she\u2019s being funny, it\u2019s all very friendly and inoffensive\u2026 it\u2019s just that I\u2019m not laughing. I opened my eyes to stare at a bright blue tulle monstrosity with a skirt that would hit me at mid-thigh. I\u2019d look like the really slutty bride of Cookie Monster. I muttered a really bad word under my breath, which earned me an evil look from Ms. East, but surprisingly, no punishment. \u2018A really bad word\u2019? Seriously? I kept on telling myself how very Disney-fied this story is, not only on the humor but also in the drama (walking out while crying, plopping on the bed while having girl talks etc.), realising belatedly this is a Hyperion book. I have nothing against this kind of funny of course, and as I\u2019ve said Sophie didn\u2019t piss me off as much as I dreaded but the humor hardly counted for me as this book\u2019s strongest suit. I liked the ease in the flow of the story and I suppose the predictability of the plot helped some. This employed A LOT of the high school cliches (i.e. mean girls, the prettiest mean girl dating the guy Sophie\u2019s angry crushing on, a freaking Formal Ball etc.) and Urban Fantasy tropes that could only work for me if the characters are likeable enough (view spoiler) [ so Sophie turns out to be a \u201cspecial kind of witch\u201d and while I was hardly surprised with the reveal, a small hopeful part in me wished that she gets told that her father is a mid-level customer relations employee for a mediocre brand of magical cat food instead. Now, wouldn\u2019t that be more fun? (hide spoiler) ] . Hawkins also has a habit of telling me A LOT of things. How this girl is goddess-like gorgeous and how that particular shade of pink is beautiful with the subtext of being cold and this electric raspberry shade is meant to convey quirkiness and friendly warmth. Oh and I should be swooning over Archer Cross. Because\u2026 he likes to wear his tie loose, collar unbuttoned and smirk a lot? Because\u2026 he was \u201cslender almost to the point of skinny\u201d in one page and armed with the taut chest muscles of sexiness in the next? Because\u2026 of the spoiler that I won\u2019t be discussing here? But for some reason after all that I\u2019ve whined about, I liked the way the story progressed in the last quarter. It felt a little rushed but stoked enough curiosity in me to shelf this series as a perhaps rather than an outright NO. I\u2019m actually more interested in the groundskeeper. (Kindly warn me ahead if this is all the extent of Cal\u2019s participation so I may abandon posthaste.) Also on Booklikes.

When I was younger I was one of those girls who wanted to be a witch I would watch all the witchy films and programmes.. My favourite being The Worst Witch and I couldn't help keep imagining it while reading this. I loved that it was based in the school, I guess being a huge fan of Harry Potter I couldn't help but think of Hogwarts and when Sophie and the students would go to the hall for dinner and the teachers having their own bit at the front.. Yes I thought of the hall where Harry would go but it never bothered me I actually got all giddy over it. Saying that this is completely different to Harry Potter although a few similarities I did notice. What's Hex Hall About? Sophie lives in the human world with her Mother and although she knows she's a witch she isn't a great one. While at her school prom she tries to help a girl at her school get a date, this goes completely wrong and so Sophie gets sent to Hectate Hall a school/institution for Prodigium adolescents. Prodigium. Just a fancy Latin word for monsters. And that's what everyone at Hectate was. This school is to protect and instruct shapeshifters, witch, and fae children who have risked exposure of their abilities. Some spells being small while others being dangerous and have/could harm others. Its like a boarding school but for magic and somewhere I would of loved to of gone as a child!! As soon as she steps out the car all hell breaks loose and she nearly gets attacked by a werewolf/student. I know I would love Sophie as instead of using spells she just shouts BAD DOG This is where she meets Archer who ends up saving her from the werewolf/student. \"You know.\" someone said to my left, \"I usually find a blocking spell to be a lot more effective than yelling 'bad dog,' but maybe that's just me.\" Lets just say these two start off with a little love/hate relationship. Archer is the bad boy at Hectate which students call Hex for short. He's a warlock (male witch) and is dating the most popular and super bitchy girl at the school. Archer ends up being actually very sweet and becomes friends with Sophie, you notice he's protective of her and ends up saving her a load of times. After that little drama she meets Jenna who will be her roommate who is a vampire, the only vampire student at the school. At first Sophie is worried I mean who wants to share a room with a blood, thirsty vampire. Once she gets in the room she notices actually Jenna is pretty normal while very girly.. I don't know what I was expecting a vampire's room to look like. Maybe lots of black, a bunch of books by camus... Oh, and a sensitive portrait of the only human the vamp had ever loved, who had no doubt died of something beautiful and tragic. But this room looked like it had been decorated by the unholy lovechild of Barbie and strawberry shortcake. Straight away I loved Jenna I could tell she would be a great friend to Sophie. How can you not know someone is nice when they have pink in their bangs. While reading this I had a funny feeling something wasn't quite right about this school and things that started to happen. We have a suspicious murder and lots of other twist. While there is a creepy, dark undertone to this book its still fun and at times hilarious. All characters was well built. I got addicted to this book and needed to find out the truth to all these dark, mysterious secrets! ...more 3.5 stars as whole. The first half was entertaining but nothing exceptional. I decided to round up and give it a 4 star rating because the last 50 pages were a lot of fun and quite unexpected. In lieu of a normal review, I have decided to veer from my usual wordy analysis of the book and instead leave you with some of my favorite passages : \"The guy next to her, he's the vamp,\" Jenna said through a mouthful of pie. She pointed to a really good looking guy in his thirties with black curly hair. \"L 3.5 stars as whole. The first half was entertaining but nothing exceptional.

What a tool.\" I groaned. \"You're not helping.\" \"Sophia Mercer,\" Elodie intoned, \"we have come to induct you into our sisterhood. Say the five words to begin the ritual.\" I blinked at her. \"Are you freaking kidding me?\" On the upside, my crush on Archer was totally gone. Over. Once a boy has slammed his kneecap into your rib cage, I think any romantic feelings should naturally go the way of the ghost. I opened my eyes to stare at a bright blue tulle monstrosity with a skirt that would hit me at mid thigh. I'd look like the really slutty bride of Cookie Monster. ...more", "Title": "Hex Hall"},
