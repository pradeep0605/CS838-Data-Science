Either my conversation partner will look at me with eyes of wisdom and upraised chin and say, \"You're young, you'll change your mind,\" or they'll screech \"WHAT???!!! Yes. You do!\" But I don't want kids and probably never will, and it's not a shoot from the hip folly of youth sort of idea but a decision I've given a lot of thought to. My family history is a potpourri of unpleasant genes that I would hate to pass on to another human being. The world is overpopulated enough as it is. Plus I am almost certain that I would be the Ayelet Waldman mother who resents her kids at least half of the time for taking energy and focus away from her relationship with her husband. Above all, I have never had that \"maternal instinct.<---F>\" It's just not there</---F>. In my early teens I was sometimes forced to babysit for my younger cousins with my sister. I would lay on the couch and read and dole out snacks, counting the minutes until my aunt and uncle came home, while my sister picked up the kids and played and changed their diapers and talked so easily in those baby voices that I refused (<---B>and still do refuse</---B>) to use. Kids can be cute, but I don't want to spend too much time with them. Some of us are meant to be parents. Some of us are not. And I think it's better for those of us who are not to recognize that before we screw up the next generation. <+++>Bee Season</+++> is an entire book about what happens when two people who shouldn't have kids go ahead and have kids. Predictably, the kids are treated as appendages, unconsciously encouraged to compete with each other for their parents' favor (which isn't even favor so much as just attention ) while their parents try to make themselves whole. The Naumann household is something of a worst case scenario. But it should be required reading for those You Really Want Children, Yes You Do! people. Goldberg's depiction of the brother/sister relationship between the Naumann kids, Eliza and Aaron, is perfect. Before they got to the age where they realized they were in competition to be the smartest, most worthy child, they were a team, scheming to get the best pieces of cake in the synagogue. It's heartbreaking (but true) when Aaron starts to ignore Eliza and can't even look at her face over dinner, once she starts winning her spelling bees and winning over their father where their father was previously Aaron's alone. That's exactly what happens in a family where love is based on merit. Resentment for that parent is only a speck of a seed, to bloom sometime in the future when the child is old enough for hindsight. I also liked Aaron's religious wanderings as a rebellion to his father's Judaism, once his dad stops paying attention to him. There is some interpersonal reason for everything that happens in this book, but the reasoning is never too annoyingly obvious. Goldberg is a smart writer that way. <+++>Bee Season</+++> is very well done. But I can't say I loved reading it, because the Naumanns are so much like a real, recognizable family that it's uncomfortable. Who loves reading about parents who shouldn't be parents parenting? I don't. But I do love reading about kids overcoming the issues born of their parents who shouldn't have been parents, and there is enough of that here to make the reading worthwhile. It's more like 3.5 stars. ...more This book was masterfully written and extremely surprising.

Goldberg captures beautifully the suffocating love and expectations (administered in special cases through skill-and-drill) that parents inflict on their children, as well as the cruelty kids inflict as they seek to aggressively distinguish themselves from their parents. As the book progressed, however, I felt the characters were retreating from me and turning into symbols/crazy people. I like symbols and crazy people and symbols for crazy people (see: the Artist Formerly Known as Prince), but I put the book down feeling a little disappointed, missing the people I had been delighted, for a time, to meet and follow. ...more \u039c\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b4\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03cc. \u0394\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03ce\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c6\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4, \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c0\u03b9\u03c1\u03c4\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1. \u0395\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b7\u03b3\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03bb\u03b8\u03cc\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03ac, \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac \u03b4\u03c5\u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 (\u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1), \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03bc\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03c2. \u0395\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b5\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03ce\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b5\u03be\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5. \u039c\u03b7\u03bd \u03bc\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03c3\u03c9 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf perfectimundo \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039c\u03b9\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03bc\u2026 (\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b9 \u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u03af \u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2)\u2026 \u03a4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c3\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b7 \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b8\u03b1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03c1\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9, \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03b1\u03c0\u03bb\u03ce\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ac\u03c6\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1!

Miriam--who had to pretend to be a lawyer yet live off her inheritance so she could steal things to put the world right and compulsively clean her kitchen, ignores her children and husband she didn't understand. Saul--a man who is caught up in his own world of jewish mysticism, a man who has spent his life tryting to find that mysticism first thru drugs and sex and finally thru Abulafia (hebrew letter mysticism) which he believe will come thru his daughter who he has pretty much ignored until she wins the spelling bee at school, a man who pays attention to his son and then completely forgets about him while working w/ his daughter on the spelling and indoctrinating her into Abulafia's work. Yet he refuses to see the similarities between what he is trying to teach his daughter and the choice of Hare Krishna religion that his son has chosen. A man who doesn't have the slightest idea what is going on with his wife and is so caught up in his own persuits that he fails to recongnize that his wife is mentally ill and that his son has switched religions. Aaron--a boy who has been seeking experiences with god since he saw a flashing red light from a plane reflected in the clouds, a boy who wants to grow up like his father but is usually ignored by him except for the study sessions he has with him which disappear when Eliza wins the spelling bee. He finally finds what he is looking for with Hare Khrisna, and spends his days chanting for hours and wanting to live in the temple to escape the real world. Eliza--a below average student who has a talent for spelling words. She is basically ignored by both parents until she wins the spelling bee where she is then in the good graces of her father. She latches onto the theory's of Abulafia and wants to communicate with God thru letters. She too spends hours and hours chanting and doing word permutations in order to get closer to god (not much different than Aarons chanting). I think she is the only one that may go back to some semblence of normalcy when she purposefully mispells a word in the first round of the next spelling bee. I liked these characters in the beginning of the book but after they spent the whole book spiralling down in their own versions of maddness, I just wasn't really interested in their story...maybe it was all just a little too unbelieveable that really none of these people was remotely normal in any way. I am still not sure I understand the point of the story or even the ending. I think the end was Eliza's way of trying to regain some sort of normalcy back in her life. I don't think I could recommend this book to my friends as something I liked but it was interesting. ...more So much is made in other reviews of this book of the family that seeks perfection only to fall further and further from it, but I think the story isn't so much about perfection as it is about just plain seeking.

The Jewish mysticism (which by the way was a bizarre new way of looking at the Jewish religion (especially after reading so much Chaim Potok) and again left a bad feeling in my stomach) is out-right frightening, though the author does a rip-snortin' good job describing it.

We talked lots about how it failed. To be clear, we all agreed that it wasn't a bad book, just a badly-executed one. There's something almost dishonest in the construction and manipulation of the characters, and the twist at the end failed for everyone, because of lack of setup and in the character type as portrayed. Goldberg clearly had something to say: likely about the pressure of academic success on children and father/daughter relationships. You could care about Eliza, and Saul was an interesting, but static, character study. The trip and fall near the end into the metaphysical wasn't really supported by the earlier plot, and again, the twist really only distracted from what the story had, up until then, been about. It's a build up of Eliza and her mother's story wasn't every really there, and didn't mean anything. And again, no one really changes in this book, though it seems intended as a character-driven work, the characters aren't enough to carry that description. If this one is already on your list for whatever reason, you may as well read it. But if your list is long and you're thinking of adding another, skip. You may as well use the time to read something really worth it. ...more What a disturbed and messed up family..... religious obsession in any form, any religion, is warped and vile to my senses.

(Oh, Chinua Achebe, you go everywhere with me). The very average, younger sister becomes the favored child when Eliza suddenly displays her surprising aptitude for turning words into carefully placed letters recited aloud. This provides an opportunity for the fissures of the family to become giant gullies straight through the middle of a very normal family. Her older brother starts spending time with people who shave their heads, smell like incense, wear orange robes, and talk about the illusions of the material world. Her mother drifts further and further away from reality. Her father misses the whole unraveling, caught up in his enthusiasm for Eliza's potential & the going-on's of Transcendence. I was captivated by the fumbling, ineffective parenting. I mean, no one really \"knows\" how to \"be a good parent,\" but it is always remarkable how best intentions can go so awry. When your kid joins a cult, is it your shortcoming as a parent? I also loved the very honest way that Goldberg explored the ways that Saul transfers his own dreams/goals onto a kid's life experience. Aaron & Eliza resolve that pressure in very different ways. This provides insight into their convictions & spirit. In the post-book interview, Goldberg says that she only knew Eliza's character and the final scene of the book, and that the rest of the story unfolded itself to her as she wrote it. Dang! What a ride through the fiction lurking in the back of Myla's brain. I read this on the suggestion of Ariel Federow. She said, \"I liked it a lot.

It's almost like Goldberg began writing and midway through thought, \"hmm...what can I do to make this seem like the worst family ever created?\" I mean, the family is so messed up that it doesn't even seem real. Goldberg attempts to paint a picture of a typical American household but fails miserably. Aside from the plot, the writing was horrible. When reading a book, I tend to analyze the characters. Upon analyzing these characters, I found nothing. To me, they were very one-dimensional. It seemed like they were simply photos of people, not actual people. I couldn't connect to any of them. Meanwhile, I was distracted by the terrible writing. It reads like thesaurus threw up on it. An 8th grader could have done better. My final words to you: Don't read this book. ...more Fascinating book. I loved this very intense story of a girl and her father, mother, and brother.

I found the brother\u2019s story implausible and thought his mind worked more like a child\u2019s. The father was OK but pointless. I wish this book had been written from the mother\u2019s perspective and touched on every member of the family, but without going into the details of their childhoods. With each character given equal weight, the story became overwrought with each character\u2019s version of \u201cbut what does it all mean ?\u201d resulting in no cogent story at all.

This book is so beautifully written... it flows and the language is so poetic and illustrative. I could not imagine seeing the movie, as I think it would ruin the magic of the book. The writing presented such PERFECT images in my head (like Miriam's \"kaleidoscope\" and Eliza's epiphany), seeing someone else's vision of it would absolutely kill it for me. I did often find myself, though, trying to figure out what age group this book was written for. The main character is in fifth grade for the majority of the book, but there are quite a few sex scenes and references to sex and drugs. Still, an absolutely amazing book that I think will stay with me and haunt me. 4.5 stars. ...more A below average Jewish girl hopes her unexpected spelling abilities will help her save her family.

I guess anyone on reading the book\u2019s tittle would speculate it as a somewhat warm and loving little book, instead, it is about religions and gods and jews and about kaleidoscope and about experiences that only those characters in this book could ever truly understand. As for me, I don\u2019t think I can ever imagine anything like that. Miriam\u2019s morbid obsession of \u201cfixing the world\u201d, taking things she thinks that belongs to her to form her own kaleidoscope; Saul\u2019s devotion to Jewish religion and his children\u2019s own way of reaching to God; Aaron\u2019s experience with the god\u2019s revelation and his insistence of looking for and finding God and finally turning into a \u201cHare Krishna\u201d, to tell the truth, I still couldn\u2019t work out all these obscure terms. And Eliza, who is, in the beginning of the book, a sweet, if a little neglected little girl who has finally been discovered a talent and begins to shine, in the end becomes someone who has experienced such a terrifying feeling and sees God and becomes mature, and deliberately misspells a letter in the bee contest. I just don\u2019t get it. What is she trying to do? What if she loses the bee, how is she going to save her mother and her family? All those bizarre sensations, I just couldn\u2019t relate to. I can\u2019t deny that it is beautifully written, the language is flowery and the author does add to a magical touch to those descriptions, but they are too surrealistic, yet in the meantime too serious. I couldn\u2019t help but feeling confused as to the book\u2019s intention or even the book\u2019s real contents. Maybe I am just too ignorant, too oblivious to the larger context, about the religions and the letters of English, but I can\u2019t say I really like this book. I\u2019ll objectively admit its merits, and admit that I\u2019ve been intrigued and it is indeed a grasping book, but that\u2019s all.

When Eliza\u2019s newly discovered talent changes her status at home and at school, the delicate equilibrium of her family is thrown out of order, and each of the Naumanns will suffer in his or her own way. A compelling story, interestingly flawed characters, and lovely writing. The only reason it didn\u2019t end up at 5 stars is that the last third or so of the novel, as both Eliza and Aaron become ever more wrapped up in their intellectual and spiritual quests, became a bit repetitive and slow for me. Probably it was an accurate reflection of the navel-gazing that typically accompanies such questing, but for me the book lost a bit of momentum towards the end. As an aside, I was surprised to see how many of the negative reviews of this book on Goodreads cite the fact that the story is depressing in places, and that the family is unhappy and Saul and Marion less-than-ideal parents. True enough, but if a messed up family = a bad book, there went a fair portion of the world\u2019s literature. Do people really think that novels are supposed to model good parenting and display only happy, well-adjusted children and families? It seems an odd way to judge a book, but I guess we all have our own scales of value. ...more I found this book very depressing.

I found it impossible to care about any of these characters or take much of an interest in their belated efforts to extricate themselves from the ruins of their dysfunctional family life. As a culture we are very comfortable sanctioning religious beliefs as a coping mechanism, while condemning secular delusions, alcohol, and controlled substances as a source of refuge from the harsh realities of a cruel world. It seems to me that people generally only succeed in abandoning one form of solace by replacing it with another. As I finished this book I was wondering if Saul, Aaron and Eliza would ultimately come to terms with reality, or would merely adopt a different coping mechanism.

I honestly wouldn't recommend this book. While the characters are engaging and multi-faceted, the tension in the family is grating, and the book is deeply disturbing. Moreover, I think that the narrative itself could have used more editing. It seems like the author took two unrelated concepts -- spelling and mysticism -- and shoehorned them together into the same book. It turns out that the author had studied this particular mystic in college, which would explain her own fascination with him and his concepts, but I feel that it hurts her story overall. Just my two cents. ...more It seemed that everyone was talking about some \"bee book\" so I mistakenly picked this up. Come to find that The Secret Life of Bees was the \"bee book\" that was so popular. Instead, I read Goldberg's odd tale of an eccentric Jewish family and was sorely disappointed.

On the other hand Eliza she wants to take her own speed to learn, to discover and grows mature. While entering the National Spelling Bee competition, she finds her own way of communication. Bee Season is written entirely from the perspective of a wise narrator. The narrator does not offer any opinion as to what happens to the characters.

Bee Season is the story of a family falling apart at the seams. The Naumanns have lived for years in a delicate balance. Saul, the patriarch, is confident that he knows and understands every member of his family and prides himself on his understanding and ability to help them all be the very best people they can be. Miriam, his wife, is an obsessive-compulsive neat-freak of an attorney who doesn't seem to really know what to do with any member of her family, especially her children. Aaron, the eldest child, is a teenager struggling with his life-long Jewish beliefs and his recent loss of his father's attention. He loses his dad's attention when Eliza, the youngest, unexpectedly proves herself to be a spelling bee prodigy after a lifetime, to that point, of absolute academic mediocrity. The day of Eliza's first two bees - winning her class bee and then the school bee - is the day that upsets the delicate balance and sends the family spiraling toward disaster. I've read in other reviews that they didn't like this book because the family is dysfunctional. Well...DUH. Did you want to read a story about a perfectly happy family? Of course not; how boring that would be. The Naumanns are absolutely dysfunctional, but they're fascinating. I've been dissecting the book a bit more in my head this time, and I think I've come up with two main points from the book: first, none of us ever truly know any other person, no matter how close to them we think we are; and second, that placing our own expectations on other people is at best pointless and at worst destructive. Every bad thing that happens in the book is brought about by the heavy weight of one person trying and failing to live up to another person's expectations. That cycle is brought to an end on the last page, when Eliza intentionally shrugs off her father's expectations of her, hoping that will begin a process of healing for her family. I still love this book. The second time around I still eagerly devoured it in less than 24 hours. I am still blown away by its beauty and complexity in such a quick read. Following is my original review from the first time I read this book in 2007. Holy shit. That's about all I can say after having finished this book in less than 24 hours. I am completely blown away by the intensity portrayed here and the weird interconnectedness Goldberg brings to spelling bees and Kabbalism and Eastern mysticism and family dynamics and mental illness and giftedness...

Maybe it's because I'm not Jewish, but the story starts to decoct into a kaleidoscope of nonsense when a) Eliza's father Saul introduces his daughter to a rigor of Jewish mysticism, b) when Eliza's brother Aaron starts to question his Jewishness, and c) when Eliza's mom Miriam starts losing it (and what it has to do with anything in the story, other than to provide an example of questionable parenting.) (without providing spoilers, it's all the \"whys\" behind Miriam's character, not sufficiently addressed by Ms. Goldberg that causes this story to unravel). Having said all that, this book was much better than I thought it would be. My interest stayed piqued throughout, and I even liked the ending. If only I could've bought all the hooey in the second half... **teensy spoiler (given my reading of this roughly coincides with the 2013 National Spelling Bee, I can't help but imagine, given the disproportionate number of Indian-Americans who dominate the bee year after year, it's difficult not to rewrite Bee Season in my head with Eliza's brother Aaron, instead of (or perhaps in addition to) attaining Krishna spiritual enlightenment, also chanting (in Eliza/Kaballah-like fashion) his way to bee-victory. Just sayin'.) ...more Bee Season is the story of the unraveling of a family which was clinging together by the barest of threads, with two parents so engrossed in their own obsessions that they listened but never heard.

Saul has created a world for himself in his tiny study full of books from which her emerges only to cook dinner for the family as his wife, Miriam, is not the domestic type. Miriam, meanwhile, is haunted by her quest to reach Perfectimundo, a state in which everything is perfectly clean, sterile, and in its correct place. And then there's Eliza, who is tracked as a lower-achieving student in second grade and manages to float through life on a cloud of after-school sitcoms, achieving nothing out of the ordinary until she rockets to the national spelling bee in fifth grade. What follows is the family's gradual collapse, helped along by Aaron's decision to find God in the Hare Krishna faith, Miriam's schizophrenic kleptomania, and Saul's newly-found belief that his daughter can be trained to become a direct link to God based on her talents with letters. Eliza, thrilled at the prospect of her father finally noticed her, plays along until the bitter end when everything snaps. Bee Season is gut-wrenching and by its end, makes the reader feel like he might have descended into the darkness that this family inhabits. Goldberg is a gifted writer, and I look forward to reading more of her work, if perhaps of a more optimistic slant. ...more This took me ENTIRELY by surprise.

Kudos to Goldberg for capturing the immense complexity of Jewish mysticism as well as daring to delve into some of the dark worlds her characters inhabit. Reading this as a writer, I was in awe of her talent for both ideas and words. I'll go so far as to compare her even (prepare for it) to Toni Morrison in her meticulous word choice and decisions of when to reveal what. As one of the choices for the 11th grade summer reading, I was a bit surprised by some of the text's graphic nature, but at the same time, I understand its function and thus am happy it's on our list. I wonder how many students will choose this one; it's certainly not a fast read nor is it easy on the emotion or intellect. I actually had to put it down at times when Eliza was deep in the letters, fearing I too might start trying to \"feel\" the sounds. Crazy, I know. I probably would have put this down after starting had it not been \"assigned,\" and I'm glad that that did not happen. This will definitely be a book I recommend and return to myself from time to time. ...more I really enjoyed this book ... it kind of made me think of many of the books I used to read by authors such as Chaim Potok (in its discussion of the acceptance and denial of Jewish mysticism and religion as a whole) and Judy Blume (in that it dealt with growing up with all-to-human parents, rites of passage and much more). ...And yet this is a book for adults and deals with adult emotions and issues!

I was really uninspired by the lengthy descriptions of the 'A-ness of A' and how an A felt to Eliza. Then there was the philosopher Abulafia and his strange ideas about words and their permutations. When Eliza sends herself into a trance I was completely lost, too weird. So what did I enjoy about this novel? Well, not much, unfortunately, but I loved the collection that Eliza's mother made. I wished I could have seen it. This book was not at all what I had expected - a lightweight coming of age novel with a spelling bent. Instead I got a tediously descriptive, drawn out philosophical and religious treatise. Not for me I'm afraid. ...more", "Title": "Bee Season"},
