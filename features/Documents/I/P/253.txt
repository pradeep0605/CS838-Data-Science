Coben delivers again!! I'm always left in awe after reading one of his mysteries and this time I was thrown all over the place! This is truly a spine tingling, fast paced, game changing novel. It was such a page turner that I stayed up late to finish it, I just had to know what happened! This book is awesome. It begins with Beck and his wife at the lake for their anniversary. The night begins nicely for the couple until Elizabeth's scream pierces the air and Beck is attacked. When he wakes he is told his wife is..... Dead. Eight years later Beck is at work and gets a strange email..... And from there the chase is on. Is Elizabeth dead or not? Beck goes from being a doctor to knocking down cops in the matter of one day. Coben has a way of pulling every single character in the book back to one event... He knows how to pull them back in like a magnet. I swear Coben is one of the best authors I've read. The books are thrilling, page turners and I can't get enough of them. Sometimes I have to go back and reread parts to make sure I got them right.<---F> I highly recommend this book</---F>. You will love it! ...more When a man receives a mysterious email from his deceased wife, he sets out on a quest for answers. One of the all-time great thrillers. Dr. David Beck and his wife Elizabeth are the kind of couple that is so perfect that most of us would hate them. They met when they were little kids and they\u2019ve been in love ever since. They\u2019ve got cute little code phrases like \u2018kiss time\u2019 that marks their first smooch, which they know to the minute, of course. So when a super happy couple like this has an anniversary to celebrate, they wouldn\u2019t think of doing anything as pedestrian as maybe going out for a nice dinner with a couple of cocktails Dr. David Beck and his wife Elizabeth are the kind of couple that is so perfect that most of us would hate them. They met when they were little kids and they\u2019ve been in love ever since.

So when a super happy couple like this has an anniversary to celebrate, they wouldn\u2019t think of doing anything as pedestrian as maybe going out for a nice dinner with a couple of cocktails and then returning home to sit on the couch in their sweat pants and watch The Big Bang Theory . Instead, they drive out to the lakeside cabin to the spot of their first kiss which they commemorate by reenacting the event and then marking another notch into the tree they carved their initials into the first time they swapped saliva. If this isn\u2019t enough, then they go down to the lake for a little moonlight skinny dipping and bow-chick-a-bow-wow. At this point, even the marketing people who come up with those romantic commercials that try to convince people to buy blood diamonds to celebrate their love are gagging and saying, \u201cOh, come on! That\u2019s too much!\u201d Apparently a serial killer observed these proceedings and was so sickened by their public displays of affection that he kidnapped and killed Elizabeth after bonking David on the head. 8 years later and David is still in mourning for the lost love of his life. As the police make a grisly discovery near the scene of Elizabeth\u2019s abduction that calls the official version of events into question, David gets a mysterious email that prompts him to an on-line video feed in which he sees something shocking. David finds himself wrapped up in a dangerous conspiracy as he tries to learn what really happened to his wife. This is OK as far as thrillers go. It\u2019s got a nice hook to it, but like a lot of these types of story, the plot twists eventually take a turn into pure outlandishness. Plus, I read Coben\u2019s newer book Six Years recently, and that one also involves a man trying to unravel a mystery regarding his lost love so even though this one came first, it seemed more than a little repetitive to me. This book works very, very hard to convince you that the two lovebirds were truly soul mates. I guess Coben has to really sell that idea so that you\u2019d believe that anyone would risk their lives to find the truth so I get why he writes it like that. It still makes them unbelievable characters because they\u2019re just too perfect as a couple, and that prevented me from fully buying in to the story. So far I prefer his Myron Bolitor series a lot more than the stand-alone thrillers of his I\u2019ve read. ...more Oh no! I've just rated a <---A>Harlan Coben</---A> book only three stars!

Women carrying too many bags. Kids who probably should have been in school leaned against whatever was available, some cooler than the next.\" I'll be on the prowl for more of his books as a matter of priority though! ...more I had never read anything by Harlan Coben and had heard he was a good mystery/suspense writer. I disagree. This book was horrible. I almost gave it NO stars, BUT, to my own discredit, I WAS sucked in to the plot and kind of wanted to keep reading it.

For example, having Dr. Beck take care of and befriend a black thug drug dealer's son only so that this same black thug could be his back up man later on? Wow, that was SO predictable and so lame. Then the whole idea of his wife's disappearance being turned on it's head just did NOT seem realistic. If they were so in love and so in tune, I just don't think it would have happened the way it did... that she'd hide all this from him. And more kept getting revealed to switch EVERYTHING around up til the very last page! It was as if Coben was paranoid that not enough excitement existed in the book so he had to keep throwing stuff at the book, everything but the kitchen sink. I will stick with the one star for suspense, but NO STARS for everything else: corny dialogue, silly plot, predictable plot.... and on and on. ...more \u201cThe sun was now in its death throes, bruising the sky a coiling purple and orange.\u201d This book is unbelievably awesome.

And this is what makes the book so special for me. \u201cMemories, you see, hurt. The good ones most of all.\u201d I enjoyed Harlan Coben's writing style so much. He surprsied me with many twists, and the whole plot was thoroughly planned. In my opinion, I do think that Tell No One is the best crime book I've ever read since I last picked Before I Go to Sleep in 2014. Coben successfully stuck me with the emotion that left me wanting to read crime novels again this year. And now I'm irrevocably a fan of him ! \u201cDon't show me paradise and then burn it down\u201d David Beck is a multidimensional character even though he presented the flat one for the first few chapters. After he digs into the evidences of his wife and is aware that maybe she's still alive, the book leaps to the highest tempo because of his mind and my suspicion that craving some answers, and you have no idea how much that feeling hit my brain so many times until I promised my self I had to finish this book before midnight. Tell No One also has thrilling vibes and action scens, too, so you don't have to worry that it will bore you to death. After I finished Tell No One, I have to tell EVERYONE about how amazing this book is. Harlen Coben will be the first author, from now on, when I think of crime novels, I'll pick his other books without hesitation. 4.5 stars for this mind-blowing and cunning book !

The 13th ring around a heart with their names in against the tree, was the last time they would celebrate a love that started out just about their first year together in school. It was impossible for him to get over the events and move on with his life. He had no other choice but to sleuth his way to the truth of what happened that night in the lake when Elizabeth disappeared and he woke up in the hospital five days later. Now, after all these years he was warned not to tell anyone about the emails. And he didn't. And the clues keep stacking up that there was much more to his memories than the serial killer who was arrested for a crime. Someone was sending him pieces of his own memories he had never shared with anyone ... In an unpredictable, fast-moving suspense drama, the past is connecting with the present at breakneck speed. Nothing seemed what is was, and people had a side to them he had yet to discover. A really good read! ...more I\u2019m a fan of Harlan Coben\u2019s Myron Bolitar series and decided that I\u2019d start this book without reading the synopsis.

I had a really tough time putting this book down for interruptions (sleep, errands, meals, etc.) because it was pretty unpredictable, a staple of Coben\u2019s stories. You think you know who the good guys are, only to be disappointed at a later juncture. Even the good guys are presented with moral dilemmas where they make dicey choices and you question your own self as to whether you would have done things differently. Here you have a man who's done nothing but the right things expected of him and in the space of 24 hours is consorting with people and doing things he would never have considered as an option the day before. The story kept me off balance the entire time and the twist at the end really caught me off guard, just when I believed I had everything sorted out. If you like tension, action, mystery and strange suspense and a little bit of romance, you\u2019ll like this book. I certainly did. ...more 4.95 stars! So good. And I will explain my ridiculous rating too. I don't think I've ever read a book that left me guessing so much. Literally to the last page.

Another sticking point for me was the violence. It wasn't super violent, but the threat of super violence was there. This is a story with REALLY bad guys in it. More than I'm really comfortable with, but still--the dang story was so engrossing I couldn't put it in, regardless of my delicate sensibilities. All of that aside though, this was one of the most exciting books I've ever read. Now the question is, will I read another one of his books?

I recommend reading this book when you have a night to yourself and have time to read the whole book... because you will not want to put it down. ...more Wow. This book grabbed me from the very beginning! I almost gave it 5 stars. It's ALMOST that good but I got a little lost here and there so that's why it's not quite 5 stars. Great reading!! Harlan Coben does it again. I'm quitting this with less than 40 pages to go. I just do not CARE how they're going to best the bad guy. I hate Coben's writing style. HATE it. I hate the way his characters act pseudo-clever and the way they're purposely evasive so the conversations have to go on longer than necessary. The plot wasn't even very interesting. I'm still counting this as read. The only reason I picked it up was for a challenge. I can't believe I made it this far. This was okay. Not great. Also, the narrator sighed all the time, like he couldn't stand being there, or reading the book. This was a real page turner. I just felt so let down at the end. It was like...all this build up and it could've been beautiful...but it was just short of perfection. That's my take, anyhow. Great Book! One star as I managed to finish this.

Not a triller - thriller is supposed to thrill (in the cover it says it's a thriller) (oh wait, I've seen some trailers, so looks like they are making it a Hollywood budget movie. The story is still B so even hiring the most expensive actors can't save the story) * the villains are painted way too villains. Fine for cartoons, not for a thriller * solution was weaker than a homeopathic liquid diluted 1 part to 100000 of water. Who killed B.. the saint is low * the painted saintness of Elizabeth, the dead-or-not wife was too icky * the actions of Beck were screaming B movie in many occasions.

Here is what he said about the subject of Racial profiling... I am not above making quick judgments based on appearance-or, to use a more politically current term, racial profiling. We all do it. If you cross the street to avoid a gang of black teens, you're racial profiling; If you don't cross because you're afraid you'll look like a racist, you're racial profiling; if you see a gang and think nothing whatsoever, you're from some planet I've never visited Highly Recommend it.....

It bothered me because if I were the character, I would have said the thing right away instead of beating around the bush. 2. Two guys are in a car. If I were one of the guys, I would have said or asked things that he did not. His silence allowed an interesting twist to be revealed a few minutes later. It was convenient for the author, not logical for the reader. 3. I like twists and surprises but the main twist was hard to believe. A loving couple kept secrets from each other, which were the kind of secrets a loving couple would not keep from each other. But that was the basis for the book. The overall result is a decent mystery story. But my problems were linked to characters\u2019 actions not fitting their motivations. AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR: The narrator Ed Sala was very good. I liked the way he paused. Some narrators don\u2019t pause enough. DATA: Narrative mode: David parts were 1st person. Other parts were 3rd person. This worked well.

My curiosity got me. That's not enough for me to consider a book 'good', though. I really was turned off by the gory torture scenes.

After the first one, I could tell when one was coming and simply skipped over that chapter/those pages. It made for a very quick read. Really dumb. I didn't like how everything was all wrapped up so nicely in the end. Too hoakey. I didn't like the sexual references and crass humor by the detectives and FBI. I skipped those pages, too. Yuck, basically. I'll take an LDS thriller over this any day. That being said, I really don't think mystery/thriller is my cup of tea. It just doesn't float my boat or frost my cookie. Thanks, but no thanks. A book needs to be more than a page-turner to be a 'good book', whether it be clean or dirty. It needs to leave me with tools to better my life or my perception of others' lives. At least the Navy Seals lockdown book helped me appreciate the difficulty a spouse of a SEAL has in not knowing where their husband is or when he'll return...even if the portrayal was sappy. What did THIS book leave me with? A bad taste in my mouth and my being annoyed at the author throughout the rest of the week as I contemplated all of the weak points and 'holes' in his plot and writing. ...more \u0645\u0630\u0647\u0644\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627\u064b \u062c\u062f\u0627\u064b \u062c\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u062c\u0645\u0644 \u0645\u0627 \u0642\u0631\u0623\u062a ! \u0623\u062d\u062f\u0627\u062b \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u062a\u0648\u0642\u0639\u0629 \u0623\u0628\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0631\u063a\u0645 \u0623\u0646\u064a \u0634\u0639\u0631\u062a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0641 \u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0639\u064a\u0629 !!! \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0645\u0646\u0639\u0646\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0635\u0641\u064a\u0642 \u0648\u0628\u0634\u062f\u0629 \u0648 \u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0633\u062a\u0637\u0639 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0635\u0641 \u062d\u062c\u0645 \u0633\u0639\u0627\u062f\u062a\u064a \u062d\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u062c\u062f\u062a \u0623\u0646 \u0647\u0627\u0631\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u0643\u0648\u0628\u0646 \u0644\u062f\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649 \u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0648\u062c\u062f\u062a \u0643\u0646\u0632\u0627\u064b * \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0647\u0648\u0644 * ! \u0648\u0648\u062c\u062f\u062a \u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628\u0627\u064b \u0623\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0636\u0645\u0647 \u0644\u0642\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0629 \u0643\u064f\u062a\u0651\u0627\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0636\u0644\u064a\u0646 . . \u0623\u0646\u0635\u062d \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0648 \u0628\u0634\u062f\u0651\u0647<---C>Shauna</---C>", "Title": "Tell No One"},
