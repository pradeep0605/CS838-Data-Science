WHY DIDN'T I READ THIS BOOK SOONER?! It was so AWESOME! MY EMOTIONS!! Let me go ahead and get this out of the way. I loved this book. Why in the world did I procrastinate with reading it? I've had Cinder sitting on my Kindle for a few months now and I continued to put it off over and over again. What a HUGE mistake! I even had the nerve to go into my local bookstore twice,<---M> pick Cinder up</---M>, and put it right back down. But all that doesn't really matter now because I've remedied the problem and absolutely fallen in love with this wonderful story. When I first heard of Cinder before it's release, it was gaining quite a bit of buzz known for the retelling of Cinderella . <---A>Marissa Meyer</---A>, my hat's off to you because a cyborg Cinderella in New Beijing, China? Badass. But then shortly before I read it, another blogger informed me that not only is it a Cinderella retelling, but also had Sailor Moon elements. OMG... someone had answered my prayers! \u00a0I don't think you can understand my excitement for that. Sailor Moon was my all-time favorite TV show and manga as a child. Reading Cinder reminded me of a simpler time before responsibilities, when the biggest thing I had to worry about was setting up the VCR (<---B>yes, a throwback!</---B>) every day because at 4pm, right before Dragon Ball Z , Sailor Moon would come on. If I were to miss one episode, I would cry my little eyes out because I just had to know what happened next to Serena! I have seen every episode including the fifth season that didn't air in America. I've even seen the live action series in all Japanese. And for those that watch subtitled Japanese shows, you know that there comes a time in your marathon watching where you stop reading the subtitles and start thinking Japanese in your sleep. Yes, I am super fangirling and not ashamed one bit! So I think it goes without saying that the reasons for me loving Cinder so much, aside from being blasted by a rainbow of awesome with its creative premise, is that it has a lot to do with sentimental memories. I tell you this so you can understand one big thing: I wasn't sure about Cinder at first. As soon as the book started I noticed on every obvious downfall: Predictability. Seriously, the plot twist ran up to me and sucker punched me in the face at only 10% in. This concerned me, but it quickly became a non-issue as I continued to read. Why? Because the story was interesting. It was engaging. It was just plain old fun ! And I haven't had this much fun reading a book in a while. The plot was brilliantly done. Cinder is a mechanic, under appreciated by her mother and one of her step-sisters. The other step-sister adores her. As a cyborg she doesn't have the same rights as a normal person and her step-mother goes out of her way to remind Cinder this whenever she can. One day Prince Kai (*swoon*) requests her services to fix his android. And in true fairy tale fashion he begins to fall for her not knowing she is a cyborg. But this isn't just a love story. Oh no! The world has been suffering from a deadly disease that kills in a matter of days and it starts to become painfully obvious that Earth's only hope for a cure depends on an alliance with the evil Lunar Queen. And as you may have guessed it, she has plans for Earth. Dun, dun, duuuunnnnnn! I loved all the characters in Cinder , especially the heroine. Cinder was independent, feisty, and relatable. She didn't always make the right decision, but this is a heroine that learns from her mistakes. And Tuxedo Mask Prince Kai? I loved him. Ah, the memories! The romance was so sweet. At first Cinder is wary of the Prince's advances because she is cyborg and doesn't want him to find out, but she can't help but develop feelings for him along the way. Basically what I'm saying here is that there's no insta-love. And you know how much I hate insta-love! Oh, and that ending! Marissa Meyer, how could you do that to my little heart? I need to know what happens now! You took two of my favorite stories and twisted them into this big ball of badass awesomeness and now I'm expected to wait until next year for book two?! And just look at the character line-up for the next books in the series: Scarlet , Cress and Winter . Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel and Snow White?! \u00a0I am so there . Just so we are clear, I'm not above stalking. I will have the next book and I will have it soon... An ARC was provided by the publisher via NetGalley. Thank you!

But I find myself wishing I hadn't bothered. Going into this book, I thought it was fair to expect a light, probably unremarkable, but ultimately entertaining read. I did not come to this book wanting my mind to be blown with science or to be taken to another world by beautiful prose, but I also did not expect it to be so painfully boring. Which it was. Cinder takes a bold and fascinating premise, sketches out a basic outline of it, and then never fleshes it out with any substance. Let's look at the wonders we have here. A part-cyborg protagonist, a loose Cinderella retelling in a future/alternate universe, a setting in New Beijing, and a potential war with a kingdom of Lunar people (a race who live on the moon). This sounds like a recipe for a fantastic science-fiction novel, and yet we get very little info beyond what I've provided here. Who are these Lunar people? What about their history? How did they come to be on the moon? How disappointing it was that we never found out ANYTHING about them beyond the fact that they have an evil ruler - Queen Levana. And this setting in a future/alternate world. In New Beijing, even! Do we ever get an exciting look into its culture? Any beautiful or ugly visuals? Any insight into its history, customs... anything? Nope. And even if I forgive that, if I say that maybe all that goodness is being saved for later series installments, I simply cannot forgive the lack of personality in our principle characters . Cinder and Prince Kai are empty, self-sacrificing heroes with little-to-no hopes, fears, desires and thoughts of their own. Adri is the classic evil stepmother. Iko was the not-so-funny sidekick. I'm also not sure I understand why part-cyborg people are considered second class citizens when they're basically regular humans who've had parts added to save them. But let's imagine I suspend that disbelief for a second - why did Meyer waste this perfect opportunity for Cinder to consider what it means to be human? For example, how much of a person can be replaced before they stop being a person and start being a machine? Are there really any differences between humans and machines beyond the materials they're made from? So many fascinating questions not being asked. Though really, I could have forgiven many things if only the plot had been compelling, the conflicts engaging, and the characters vaguely interesting. I honestly had to force myself through.

I applaud Marissa Meyer for thinking this up.

One day, the As seen on The Readventurer Let me first give credit where credit is due. A cyborg Cinderella ? Wow! It's a bold premise. I applaud Marissa Meyer for thinking this up. In this re-envisioning of the fairy tale, Lihn Cinder is a cyborg, meaning, she is almost half mechanical - she has prosthetic hands and a foot, a big chunk of her internal organs are wired into her body. Cinder is a mechanic in New Beijing, the capital of the Eastern Commonwealth, a country ravaged by plague outbreaks. One day, the heir to the throne of the Commonwealth, Prince Kai, steps into Cinder's shop to get his android fixed, and everything changes for Cinder. She falls in love, she becomes a center of multiple intrigues, she discovers her own well hidden (even from her) secrets. As much as I appreciate an author willing to think outside the box, I am afraid in this case Marissa Meyer bit off more than she could chew. The world of Cinder is very imaginative and full of potential. New Beijing, royalty, plague, cyborg falling in love, a war with the Lunar (Moon) Empire. I mean, just think about the possibilities here. Too bad, these possibilities are never explored to their best advantage. Let's take Cinder, for example. She is almost half robot, there is stuff wired into her brain and body. Is she a human? Does she have artificial intelligence? Does she think of herself as human? How can she love? Are her emotions real or programmed? None of this is explained with any kind of depth. I compare this book to The Adoration of Jenna Fox , and Cinder fails miserably. How about the setting? New Beijing! Futuristic China! Is there any Chinese flavor in this story? Any infusion of Eastern cultures, customs? Not really. Ok, maybe there is something to this Lunar business then? Who or what are these Lunar people? How did they get there? How do they live on the Moon? Why exactly are they at war with Earth? I still have no clue. My general impression after finishing Cinder is that every good idea in this story is developed very superficially. It's like Cinder is... Ship Breaker 's ugly cousin. What Paolo Bacigalupi managed to do in his fairly short book with great depth - the world ruined by environmental changes, genetically altered human beings, poverty - is all done here, but in the most shallow way, as if the author was determined to keep the plot moving at a break-neck pace, afraid that any paragraph spent on layering the world or characters' personalities would bore readers. There is still some entertainments value in Cinder , and I did get all the way through it to find out how the story would unfold. (BTW, you can predict the novel's outcome at about page 50 and it all ends with a cliffhanger.) But the novel fails miserably at being thought-provoking, challenging or truly engaging, even though the ideas are all there. Squandered potential. ...more I guess I'm on a year-end quest to be the last person to read popular series. Last week: Hunger Games. This week: Cinder. Or not. I hated it.

Before reading the book, I knew why it came highly recommended to me; in theory, this book should have been awesome. An Asian protagonist ( Everyone knows Khanh loves Asian shit!!!! ), an alternate universe, plenty of opportunities to spin a beautifully-woven (Asian!!!!) setting! A fairy tale retelling (Khanh loves retold shit!!!!). Yet for years, I resisted the many, many \"KHANH, YOU GOTTA READ CINDER\" because of one reason. The main character is an cyborg . I don't like cyborgs, I don't like androids. Not the Google-based operating system, the concept of part-human, part-machine . No, thank you. I like my main characters purely organic and carbon-based. Let's get one thing straight. I have nothing against technology, it's just the concept of a human meshed with a robot that bothers me. I don't think such a being can have the same emotions, the same characteristics, the same failings that makes human so, well, human . Here is where the book could have changed my mind; Cinder could have been made to be more than a inhuman robot (what she is, in my mind). What's ironic to me is that Cinder is too human. I know she is part machine, but it never felt like that part of her was explored as much as her humanity is sold to us. Furthermore, the KHANH LOVES ASIAN SHIT part of me was so not sold on this. Yes, it's cute that the MC is Asian. Yes, it's cool that the new world is New Beijing. Those are just names, this is not an Asian-based book. You know how you go to one of those super chic Asian fusion restaurants and you order a fusion dish that costs $100 on a beautiful plate, and the only thing that's \"Asian\" about it is the one drop of lemongrass essence that they add to the sauce? This book is like that. There is no explanation about New Beijing's culture. There is no explanation as to why it became that way. It was a world that was entirely unexplored, and unworthy of the hype, and of the \"Asian\" label slapped onto it. Sorry, guys, this series is not for me. ...more *4.5*This was amazing!!

This book looked so much better in my head. I replaced this With this I\u2019m sure Cinder would prefer to be the uncool version. Dude, you\u2019re a freakin\u2019 cyborg... I wouldn\u2019t hide this from the world, I\u2019d enhance it. Probably add some cool gadgets and make everyone drool over me. Imagine the possibilities since you\u2019re a badass mechanic! Imagine what you could create!!!! And Mrs. Meyer, please boost your universe. There are so many things you missed in this new world you have created. I want to know more about their infrastructure, more about what type of transportation they have, what clothes, toys, gadgets, what food even! There are so many possibilities out there! The book\u2019s weakest element was Kai. His POV made me almost fall asleep. He\u2019s weak, not charming, and not funny and he bores me to tears. I wish Cinder transforms him into a brainless zombie in the coming book. But, in the end, I have to say that I didn\u2019t mind this book at all. It was a very interesting one, kept me entertained and didn\u2019t piss me off.

A deformed cyborg with a missing foot. A Lunar with a stolen identity. A mechanic with no one to run to, nowhere to go. But they will be looking for a ghost.\u201d K was mesmerized by Cinder .Even though it was a fairytale retelling,there were twists and turns in the story she could not predict.As she was reading next to the fireplace,eating chocolate and drinking chocolate flavored cappuccino,she forgot about her responsibilities and instead she grew wings and she flied to the East.She visited labs and sick people while they were sleeping,she laughed with Iko's witty retorts,she heard Evil Queen Levana scheming,she smelled the fear towards the Lunars and their unholy abilities,she saw spacecrafts take off,she swooned over a prince who was not ready to rule and give up his freedom but deep down he knew he would sacrifice even himself for the sake of his people and finally,she landed on a basement,hiding in a corner,watching a stained with grease mechanic named Cinder working and dreaming that one day her life would be hers,that she would be considered a human and not an emotionless machine. \u201cDo your kind even know what love is? Can you feel anything at all, or is it just... programmed?\u201d K loved the multiple POVs because they gave her the chance to witness both Cinder's life and the politics of the Empire.She was aggravated by the social injustice,she was hurt by some characters' malice and hatred,she felt giddy when Kai tried to flirt with Cinder and frustrated with all the secrets and the hidden agendas.Even though she loved the romantic element,she was actually happy it wasn't overwhelming and many other themes were explored,like Cinder's journey to finally accept herself,Levana's reign and plots,Kai's struggles regarding his new role,the part androids and cyborgs played in the society and the attempts to find a cure.In the end,K couldn't help but admit that Marissa Meyer is more than capable of enchanting the reader,even in a technology dominated world. There are two reasons she didn't give Cinder 5 stars though.First,she found Cinder's behaviour towards Kai extremely infuriating because how can you keep saying no to a sweet prince that practically begs you to go the ball with him ?If she just stopped hiding the truth and acting like a child on a whim things would be so different!And second,K had a gut feeling that the next books would be even better so she decided to save the fifth star for them. If you're one of the few people who haven't read Cinder yet,don't hesitate to try it.It's different,unique and extremely enjoyable! P.S.

It had translations of the original German versions of the stories I\u2019d been listening to for years, but were so not the same. There were also new stories I\u2019d never heard before, like The Seven Ravens . I haven\u2019t read it in years, but basically it\u2019s about a girl whose evil stepmother turns her seven brothers into, yes, ravens, and she (a little girl) has to go on a perilous journey to save them, a journey in which she ultimately CUTS OFF her own finger to unlock some door. And that is a for-real Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tale, folks. Anyway, I heart fairy tales and I always have. Also, I wanted to be an astronaut my entire childhood, until I had to get glasses in the fourth grade (destroying that dream), AND I was a fan of dystopian lit long before The Hunger Games . THE POINT: Cinder by Marissa Meyer is a Sci-Fi/Dystopian retelling of . . . wait for it . . . C-I-N-D-E-R-E-L-L-A. Or Aschenputtel if you wanna get German. I\u2019ll admit that I was leery at first. My previous experiences have lead me to conclude that frequently retellings are just lazy writers standing on the shoulders of other peoples\u2019 greatness. *laughs pompously* No so, Cinder . And to my surprise and delight, Cinder follows the more German tradition of fairy tales (vs the Disney version). Cinder, not just the book title, but also the name of the MC, not only has a nasty stepmother and two stepsisters (kind of\u2013it\u2019s a guardianship, and one of the \u201csisters\u201d isn\u2019t bad at all), but she is a CYBORG. *cackles with glee* And not only is Cinder a CYBORG, but she lives in a plague-riddled, post-apocalyptic world. New Beijing is the Capital of the Eastern Commonwealth and is governed by an Emperor, which is where we get our prince. In addition to a prince, we also get an evil, A-L-I-E-N queen. An evil. A-L-I-E-N. Queen. Well . . . A-L-I-E-N in that she\u2019s from the Moon. Apparently Earth colonized the Moon centuries ago, and those colonists evolved . We\u2019re talking GENETIC MUTATIONS people. Like X-Men. Only the queen is Magneto, not Xavier (thus the evil). LOVED it. And even if you don't ordinarily go for YA books, if you like fairy tales, science fiction, and/or dystopian novels, then I would definitely give Cinder a chance, b/c it doesn't read like a typical YA book. Cinder's not in high school, dealing with high school issues. She works full-time as a mechanic and is reviled by society for being a CYBORG. The issues that Cinder is faced with are very adult issues--as far as I can tell, Cinder is only YA by virtue of having a sixteen year old MC, and no scenes-to-make-you-blush. Highly recommended.

So you have a pretty faithful ish retelling going on here. Of course, since it's sci-fi Cinderella, there are going to be some substitutions to the carriage and glass slipper.

What can I say, I just love this book. So much that I want to marry it. Seriously. I love Cinder. And Iko. And Kai. And I really want to bitch slap Adri and Queen Levana. I swear, every time I read this book, they seem to get bitchier and bitchier. I am now ready to start Scarlet! OHMAGERD I'M SO EFFIN' EXCITED XD.

Review after re-reading from Oct 3rd to 4th 2012: Oh my stars. I didn't think it was possible, but Cinder was even better the second time around. How can a book be this perfect? GAH! This is the first book I've re-read in a loooooong time, as I rarely ever re-read books. This just shows how awesome Cinder is. I found a lot more little details that I hadn't noticed before. Like how Iko refers to the old, ugly orange car as a \"pumpkin\" (teehee). And how Dr. Erland kept smiling secretly everytime he talked to Cinder about Lunars. Cinder...her situation broke my heart. I can really connect with her. So much that at times it felt like I was actually her. I really want Iko as a best friend! Forget humans. And Kai? Dude. LET'S GO GET MARRIED! XD I'm praying to all the Book Gods above for the release date of Scarlet to move up. I promise I'll read more. I promise to give more books a chance. I promise I won't judge a book before I read it. JUST GIVE ME SCARLET! >.< Review after reading for the first time (Feb 5th to Feb 7th 2012): HOLY CHEESUS. People. PEOPLE. This book...I-I... I think I'm in love. *gazes at the book* OHMAGOSH IT WAS SO GOOD! When I first heard about this book, I was very skeptical. See, I'm not a big fan of the whole fairytale re-telling thing. You have to actually know the fairy tales well to understand the re-tellings. I do know many fairy tales, everyone has heard at least one right? But I'm no expert on them. But if anyone asked me what my favourite fairytale is, I'd say Cinderella. I dunno, I just love Cinderella's story. But some re-tellings fail horribly. Hearing all the buzz about this book, I couldn't help but be intrigued. Eventually, I was practically DYING to read it. There was a teeny, tiny part of my brain warning me not too get too excited in case this book fails as well. From the first chapter, I fell for this book. HARD. The Good - The first thing I want to talk about, which is the most important thing, was how well the author molded the Cinderella fairytale into this re-telling. And it was not done well. Nope. It was done AMAZINGLY well. The evil stepmother and step-sisters, the prince, the ball, the \"shoe\" left behind *sigh*. It was all just so well done. I was following the original Cinderella story in my head and kept matching it to the story, half-afraid that the author would mess up and leave something out, but she didn't. I applaud her. - I loved the setting! Not many dystopian books I've read take place in places other than North America but this book took place in New Beijing. I thought it was very creative and unique. The only thing I was a bit confused about was the language. I wasn't sure if EVERYONE was speaking English, or Beijing's national language (which I think is Mandarin - I might be wrong) and we were reading the translated version. Cinder did mention different accents, but I wasn't sure. Aside from that, I loved the setting. - The plot was well thought out in accordance to the fairytale. I completely fell in love with Cinder's story. I also loved the Lunar concept. I had figured out a thing or two myself, but the twists in this story had me gasping left and right. - The romance! GAH! It wasn't heavy, nor was it minimum, just enough amount to fit the story. But it was SO good. I was squealing over and over again! GAAAH! - Oh, and the cover. LOVE IT! I am sick and tired of seeing covers with girls in dresses and while they can be very pretty, most of them barely show what the book is actually about. The cover of Cinder is not only gorgeous and eye-catching, but also show sort of a glimpse of the story. It's very creepy, with the robotic limbs and the shoe. I can't stop staring at this cover. I won't be including The In-Betweens or The Bad sections in this review because this book was just perfect. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that with every page that I turned, I was nearing the end. Which I did not want. I tried reading as slow as possible, but I also had to know how this ended! GAH! The Characters - I've read a few books before where the main character is part human and part machine, but Cinder was different. She had all these cool features, like the internet installed in her brain, the choice to shut out noises, and even compartments inside her leg to store stuff. Oh, the many times when I wished I could do that. Cinder was a great character to read and man, I felt so bad for her. She did not deserve to be treated this way. But she fights back and the more she rebelled, the more I loved her. In a way, I could understand her feelings and felt very connected to her. I nearly cried for her at the ending. - Iko! AH! If I could have a robot as a sidekick, I'd want Iko. She's probably the girliest robot I know. - I HATED Adri. She was worse than the original stepmother. I wished she'd gotten the disease. - Kai. Prince Kai. Give me a second to squeal first. *KKYYYAAAAAHHH!!!* Ahem, anyways. Kai was...so awesome. I don't even know how to describe how awesome he is. He was cute, funny, and incredibly HOT. If I lived in New Beijing, I'd no doubt be one of the girls fawning over him (though I probably wouldn't be as obvious). I mean, he's a freakin' PRINCE. About to be Emperor. Damn. But he was also a regular guy. Who was freaked out over the thought of ruling an actual country, finding a cure for the disease, and being a leader to thousands of people. That's a lot for a guy his age. But he was also strong and I believe that he will be a GREAT leader. I cant wait to see how he develops in the future novels. - And then there's Queen Levana. All I want to say about her, is that I hope this itch with a capital B gets taught a lesson. Recommended? HELL FREAKIN' YEAH! Unless, you know, you don't like Cinderella...or cyborgs...or hot Asian Princes... So, basically, this book was epic. Epic x100. I have a lot more to say about this book, but my brain is all jumbled and I can't form proper sentences, but the point is, YOU NEED TO GET THIS BOOK. I'm so glad I listened to myself and bought the book instead of taking it out from the library because if I had, I would have gotten in trouble for stealing a book from the library. But now I can hold this book in my hands, and NO ONE CAN TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME! HAH! Why oh WHY is the next book so far away? *sigh* I'm gonna go and continue what I was doing before. *gazes at Cinder* ...more Super heavy sigh 1.5 stars is more of what I felt for this (actually as time passes I dislike this more and more).

Cinder is a cyborg version of Cinderella. Awesome idea, and I have to give the author credit for putting a new spin on an old story, but I just couldn't get invested in Cinder no matter how much I tried to make myself. She was almost tstl for me. (view spoiler) [Now I'm just going to dump as much of my irritation off into here as I can remember. You guys are so lucky, lol. So she gets told that the disease can be transmitted on clothes and that it takes an hour or more for it to die. Then tell me why she leaves Peony and goes right to the prince?! She does this shit twice! She gives that boy the antidote without any thought of the repercussions, and I'm not saying he shouldn't have lived, but come on! This chick never thinks!!!!! Like she finds that old car and is determined to fix it but it has no headlights, and the only reason I even mention that is when she points out how she was thankful for the lights from the houses on the way to the palace. Then she crashes...because she can't see. How the hell are you going to get to wherever you are going without being able to see at night? Only travel during the day? Ok fine, but I don't see her doing that since she points out that she will be a fugitive (at least that is what I gathered from her thoughts). Also, how are the roads?!?! Really. If that car is SO old, and the main mode of travel is hovercrafts, than how does she expect to get to Europe and be able to find gas? How far away is Europe from the Commonwealth anyway? I took it to mean that boundaries were changed after WW4 so for all I know the \"new\"(?) Europe isn't that far. Would it have been too much to ask for some explanations in this book? What the hell does the T.E. stand for?! What in the name of God happened to make the Lunars hate the Earthens? By the way, I liked that name, lol. We get told that they had been people but were no longer, and yet they have the exact looks of humans. The only thing they seem to do is make their appearance better with their energy manipulations. So how is it that they aren't humans but still look, act, and think the way humans do? I just didn't get that. I thought maybe they would have green skin or something, haha. Oh man, there's more but I'm losing my train of thought. How about her wearing Peony's dress, and not even needing to take a moment to be sad about it? She was also GLAD to see the wrinkles, and grease, on the dress and gloves! Then she was totally fine with showing up looking like a damned drowned rat to the EMPERORS effin ball! I would have understood being wet...to a point...but she was knowingly wearing stained clothes to the ball, and just didn't care. I also got incredibly annoyed with how many times I noticed inconsistencies. For example, Cinder refers to her arms typically in that only one can feel, and then a little bit later she makes a remark about BOTH feeling. She has a computer brain, but her eyes are hers? How did the lights from her scans show up in them? How was she able to remain with her human emotions with a computer for a brain? How did she have dreams anyway? Especially since we all knew that they were dreams of her being burned courtesy of how often she mentioned it (was it supposed to be that obvious, lol. I hope so). The part when the Emprorer died Kai says he ran all the way there and had to stop to catch his breath, but I have no idea how far he ran. I even left myself a note that said--well how fucking far did he go?!--I get very frustrated with loose books. I want to KNOW damnit, and even more so when the floor number of his room is provided. Kai was very immature for someone who would have been groomed his entire life for his role. I'm fine with his going to the market in secret, and even flirting with Cinder, but when he can't even show up to a meeting with world leaders I get annoyed. I kept thinking of Prince William funny enough, and how he would never do that, haha. True story. And WHY was he telling Cinder about war plans and such?! Really. I get that Iko was supposed to be the funny sidekick, and she kind of was for me, but even she fell flat. I was picturing her as a blue robot, but at one point it says she's white. Minor detail I know, but that whole aspect annoyed me. Wow, not much seems like it didn't annoy me eh? haha! The last thing I will harp on is the whole cyborgs are less than second class citizens. They are told how they aren't human. They are walking investments! More of whom were mainly human from what I could tell. Even Cinder with her electronic brain was the picture of what a human is. She felt all the emotions that humans feel she just couldn't cry or blush. I want to know why they were treated like that. Oh my word, I just checked the notes I made on my Kindle, and I have some 19 notes, and 11 pages of highlights. Almost all of them are the times I caught some inconsistency. Like the guy telling Kai that the Lunars had that army, and following it up with saying they would attack within six months? How did he pick that time frame when they just saw the army? Bah. It was all just too loose. (hide spoiler) ] And well I guess that's about it for me, haha!! I did not realize I would spend the whole review just ranting, but that's how I felt reading this. Just...wait for it...annoyed. Haha. ...more Somewhere between 3 1/2 to 4 stars.

She meets prince Kaito, and her life goes upside down. The plot was slow paced but so good, even though it was boring for me at first and I didn't get what was happening. I loved the plot twists although I predicted some of them. But overall it was interesting and enjoyable. World Building: The Eastern Commonwealth. New Beijing particularly. I felt the world building lacks depth. I didn't know how to imagine this world with the Asian culture. But a world with cyborgs is so interesting to me. I love this world! Characters: The characters are so well-written. 1) Cinder: I loved Cinder. She is so brave, caring, smart and funny. Didn't expect to love her. She was nice. 2) Prince Kai: Of course I loved him (as usual). I imagined him as a handsome Asian guy. He is charming. He is also so responsible but so funny, too! I liked this slow burn romance and the sarcasm between those two. I love this one so much. It is hilarious!! 3) Queen Levana: She intimidated me all the time. Strong beautiful women irritates me the most (don't know why). But her character is so interesting. The End: Me while reading the last few chapters: No. What is this? NO. NO.

Cinder is forced to forfeit all of her earnings to her guardian, the woman that adopted her begrudgingly years ago when her husband brought Cinder home shortly before he died. Constantly reminded by her guardian that she is less than human, Cinder's daily existence is bleak. When the Prince unexpectantly seeks out Cinder's mechanical skills to fix an android, the story begins to get interesting. Of course, the prince is the object of every girl's fantasies, and he's genuinely nice. From the start, he shows Cinder a great amount of interest. With a pandemic plague terrifying Earth's population, and the wicked Lunar Queen lurking in the background, there is a constant feeling of danger in Cinder's world. Yet, despite everything, I never felt a strong connection to the story. There isn't any single thing I can put my finger on. It's a case of \"It's not you, it's me\". Overall, I liked the story, but didn't love it. It was sweet, but maybe too sweet for me. At some point, I might read the second book in the series. I can't help but feel like I'm missing something with all the glowing reviews that this series has received. ...more Psst! Cinder is only \u00a31.99 right now for Amazon UK Kindle!!

And there are evil lunar people living on the moon? And an android with a faulty personality chip? And there's a plague? Yes. Yes. Yes. Marissa Meyer is a fantastic story teller. Despite being set in a future Beijing with flying cars and robots, she still managed to keep a whimsical fairy tale atmosphere throughout. Of course we have the evil stepmother and stepsister, the charming Prince Kai, and a plot to take the throne of the Eastern Commonwealth. I devoured this book in about three hours, and have already checked out the second Lunar Chronicles book, Scarlet , from the library.

November 2015: 5 Stars July 2014: 4 Stars I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019ve never been a fan of the Cinderella story; I mean are audiences really expected to believe that a prince wouldn\u2019t remember a face and would go door to door with a shoe to identify a woman? It just didn\u2019t seem plausible, even as a fairy tale. So that coupled with all the fangirling and hype over this series gave me low expectations going in.

There\u2019s a bit about the evil stepmother, who is more like an adopted stepmother here. She loses one daughter to the blue moon plague and the other is just kinda there?? She\u2019s haughty and manipulative but there\u2019s not a lot of meat to this character. Our prince here is named Kai and he\u2019s about to become the emperor of New Beijing, with his coronation ceremony serving the place of the royal ball. He first meets Cinder at the booth where she works to ask her about fixing his android (view spoiler) [that we later find out is only malfunctioning because there\u2019s a chip in it used for spying and relaying information to the Lunar Queen Levana. (hide spoiler) ] Queen Levana is [in 1950\u2019s sci-fi voice:] from the Moon! . Her lunar powers allow her to manipulate thoughts via bioelectrical current, which she uses as it seems she wants to [in 1950\u2019s sci-fi voice:] take over the Earth! For what it\u2019s worth, it was an interesting read. What I didn\u2019t care for was the sometimes-awkward dialogue between the prince and Cinder. I also thought it broke the fourth wall to reference Sleeping Beauty when this series is based on fairy tales. Otherwise, [in 1950\u2019s sci-fi voice:] 4 stars FROM SPAAAAAAAAAACE . Additional thoughts: I want to say the fact that she has a prosthetic foot (and hand) comes from the original fairy tale where the stepsisters cut off their toes to fit into the shoe and the premise just snowballed from there and became a cyborg story where it was the MC who loses her foot at the royal ball.

I'm very glad she did! I'm hooked. Mkay, I'm hooked. I actually started this book about a year ago and sat it aside after a trying an failing to get through the first half. It seemed a bit juvenile to start (I know, its YA, but it just felt very tween to begin with)... and it looked like it was headed down the insta-love path of book destruction and a cheesy villain to match. I was wrong. No it isn't the most intense book I've read- but it really picks up after the half way mark. I actually did not guess Cinder's secret- because I Mkay, I'm hooked.

I actually did not guess Cinder's secret- because I knew the other books revolved around other main characters (so I was assuming the secret had to do with someone else...) - so that was actually a nice surprise for me. Not to mention the ending- I did not realize Cinder's story wasn't going to at least somewhat wrap up. Holy cliffhanger batman. So to summarize my unorganized initial thoughts... -Scifi meets fairytales - definitely a mix I haven't seen yet. -Looks like its going to be an insta-love, but nope. -Not sure about the villain yet.. seems a little too conveniently evil. We'll see. -Cliffhanger. Hurts. -I'm definitely ready for book two and excited to see where the series goes -Where is Thorne? I am ready.

Caught between duty and freedom, loyalty and betrayal, she must uncover secrets about her past in order to protect her world\u2019s future. Nine hours. Nine hours is what it took me to finish this book. If that isn't a testament to how much I liked Cinder then I don't know what is. I literally finished this story in one sitting. Hell, I haven't even eaten a single thing since I picked up this book. I was just consumed with the need to know what would happen next. \u201cShe was a cyborg, and she would never go to a ball.\u201d So, Cinder is Cinderella's story . . . with a twist. And I do love my twists. I thought Cinder made a great female MC. She's someone you're constantly rooting for and sympathizing with. While I would have lost my head, Cinder knew when to choose her battles. Which makes her much smarter than me because I would have been six feet under . . . Despite her circumstances, she never struck me as weak. She was incredibly strong and resilient and managed to keep a good sense of humor, which always goes a long way with me. \u201cI don't know. I don't actually remember anything from before the surgery.\" His eyebrows rose, his blue eyes sucking in all the light of the room. \"The cybernetic opetation?\" \"No, the sex change.\" The doctor's smile faltered. \"I'm joking.\u201d Prince Kai and Iko were amazing characters as well. I found myself going swoony over the prince and Iko was like the android best friend I never had. \u201cPrince Kai! Check my fan, I think I'm overheating.\u201d You and me both, Iko, you and me both. These three wonderful characters perfectly complimented the deep-seated hatred I now have for Adri and Queen Levana. Queen Levana can ship her ass back from where she came from and keep to herself. Adri . . . you can go with her. They tried my patience every single time they showed up. But not in a 'what poor characterization' kind of way. More like 'what amazing villains,' you know what I mean? The type of characters you love to hate. Cinder isn't just about a cyborg that wants to go to a ball, though. It's much more complicated than that. There's war, there's disease, there's pain and heartbreak. Subjects had been carted in from provinces as far reaching as Mumbai and Singapore to act as guinea pigs for the antidote testing. It was made out to be some sort of honor, giving your life for the good of humanity, but it was really just a reminder that cyborgs were not like everyone else. I thought I was signing up for an entertaining, but simple, story. That is not what Marissa Meyer had planned. By the halfway mark, theories were running rampant in my head. Which only fueled my need to finish the book and figure out exactly what was going on and what was going to happen. Hence my unintentional fasting. So yeah, you could say I liked this one ;) . . . they would be looking for a ghost. I'm off to book two . . .

I know that for most of my childhood I associated the name with animated mice, glass slippers and that \u2018Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo\u2019 song. (view spoiler) [Is it stuck in your head now? You\u2019re welcome. (hide spoiler) ] But Cinderella\u2019s roots lie centuries deeper, and forklore the world over is rich with variants on the story. Most carry the common thread of \u201cunjust oppression / triumphant reward\u201d, and the central elements and tropes have soaked down through the years, permeating today\u2019s popular culture. The very name \u2018Cinderella\u2019 has become somewhat synonymous with the persecuted heroine archetype, an icon of changed fortune. The themes and messaging around this classic take on Cinderella are understandably not all that resonant with part of its modern audience. They\u2019re less willing to see a young woman\u2019s happiness so rigidly defined, and determined by the fortuitous existence of a fairy godmother and the flick of a magic wand. There is a clamour these days for characters (particularly female) with more agency, more control over their future. And possibly less dancing rodents. Cinder is a timely and welcome re-boot of the fairytale, with Meyer changing up the rather archaic elements for a futuristic setting and a much less passive approach to the central character. In this incarnation, Cinder is a cyborg, living in New Beijing and working as a mechanic. Under the legal guardianship of a cold and disdainful \u201cstepmother\u201d, Cinder is relegated to second-class status, good enough to bear of brunt of earning the family\u2019s living, but unworthy of recognition as a true member of the family. In addition, Cinder faces prejudice due to the fact that she is a cyborg from her family, her community, even herself. The character of Cinder was quite possibly my favourite element of Marissa Meyer\u2019s book. She\u2019s an intelligent, resourceful and sharply funny young woman, who carries a wrench and isn\u2019t afraid to use it. Her vulnerabilities are counterbalanced with her strength, just as she\u2019s a blend of human and machine. And while a measure of chance and coincidence play into the events that unfold in Cinder\u2019s life, she also makes choices, takes action. It\u2019s this self-determination against the odds, (more so than her mechanical parts), that define Cinder as a modern Cinderella. I should also mention here Kai and Iko, whom I also liked immensely. Iko because she was adorable and cheeky, Kai because he was a refreshing take on the traditional \u201cPrince\u201d. It would have been incredibly easy for this character to be a cardboard cutout filling a clich\u00e9 role, but Meyer crafts a genuinely likeable and interesting character who has great on-page presence (view spoiler) [and chemistry with Cinder. Round of applause here for this book taking the road of YA tropes less travelled, and building a budding relationship I was genuinely cheering for and invested in. (hide spoiler) ] Equally, I enjoyed the world that Cinder inhabited, and the cultural elements melded together to form the Eastern Commonwealth. There are some scenes in Cinder that are quite visual, and I loved the ideas Meyer put forward to describe her New Beijing. That said, I definitely feel that there was untapped potential here. Meyer scratches the surface of an intriguing concept, gives us glimpses of fascinating world, but I wanted more. More pictured, more explained, more utilised. Particularly in terms of the multi-cultural dynamic of the Eastern Commonwealth, which I can\u2019t help but wish had been delved into more deeply. Alongside the futuristic makeover of the setting and characters, Cinder stays quite close to the original fairytale in terms of the plot. Meyer does twist a few points, and gives the story some shades of grey rather than formulaic black and white, but there aren\u2019t really any major surprises. To this end the foreshadowing throughout Cinder is not always particularly subtle. I\u2019m unsure whether the last big revelation of the book was intended to be a surprise, or whether Meyer wanted us to have guessed it in advance, but I can\u2019t say I batted an eyelid at its exposure. Despite this, I still found Cinder inventive and engaging, and there is a lot of fun to be had within it\u2019s covers. I enjoyed Meyer\u2019s vision of the future and her re-imagined take on a classic tale, and I think the ground has been solidly laid for a strong, interesting follow up.
