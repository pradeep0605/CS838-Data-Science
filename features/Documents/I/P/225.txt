Someone very powerful and possibly related with the authorities needs his expertise that only the protagonist can provide.

Meanwhile,<---M> unbeknownst to him</---M>, a secret organization has dispatched an assassin who must fulfill tasks that would have huge social ramifications all throughout the world. What the assassin and the secret organization don\u2019t know is that the purpose of the assassin/secret organization and the purpose of the person directing the assassin/secret organization, which is our antagonist, is entirely different. While our protagonist is running from the assassin and solving said puzzle (<---B>which has to be solved within 24 hours</---B>), he is joined by a young, beautiful and intelligent woman related somehow with dead man/instigator. At the very last moments of the book we have a final reveal: the protagonist knew the antagonist from the very start! He was being manipulated the whole time! The book ends with the antagonist succeeding somehow. The protagonist and the readers are left with a moral question on whether the antagonist is truly the villain... or did he do something that actually benefits the whole world. -- Is <+++>Inferno</+++> different from other Dan Brown books you ask? No it's not. There are minor variations to Brown's tried and tested formula, but it will not add anything to your reading experience. The book is recycled to its core. In fact, depending on how many of Brown's books you have read, you can see the twists coming based on the number of pages left.<---F> tl;dr: Don't waste your time </---F>...more I guess this will fulfill my yearly quota for Mickey Mouse watch-clad academics who solve ancient conspiracy filled puzzles. - - - Updated 5/31 : Sometimes, I feel like Dan Brown is my nemesis.

In interviews, he comes off as a smart, earnest guy (if a bit of an academic dweeb*) who has an obsession for puzzles, old art and conspiracy theories, but also as a guy who has no idea how to laugh at himself. He seems to take his own work very seriously, and gets his feelings hurt by even the eensiest teeny baby criticism. He writes the same four or five characters over and over in every book he\u2019s ever written. He writes books that have sold millions of copies but he has no idea how to write a character that doesn\u2019t flounce around his stories like a puppet with his hand up its ass. He seems to enjoy writing books that will make people tear their hair out in fits of aplopleptic rage. Once, I\u2019m pretty sure he compared himself to Shakespeare, but I can\u2019t find the article right now so you\u2019ll just have to trust me, I guess. He completely disavows the notion that he writes with a formula**. The public image he\u2019s created for himself sometimes gives me a strong urge to chew up nearby scrap paper and then spit it at the back of his head. And I\u2019ve never hocked a spitball in my life. * I say this as a former academic dweeb myself, so don\u2019t go crying into your Cheerios, Dan. ** The Dan Brown Formula: Something mysterious/creepy/violent/potentially life-changing happens, setting into motion a chain of events that can only be stopped/uncovered for what they really are by our Protagonist, an intelligent middle-aged gentleman who happens to be an expert in his field, but also in the specific areas necessary to saving the world/uncovering a mystery/solving puzzles laid out for some unknown reason by a shady Antagonist (more on him later). Protagonist is always handsome, extremely well-educated, and single. He purposesly sets himself apart from the main populace, observing the common culture and placing it historical context rather than participating. Protagonist has one or two defining traits that will be mentioned over and over again in lieu of characterization. Protagonist, with the help of a beautiful (usually young) woman who finds him handsome and is generally impressed by him, solves a series of mysteries/puzzles in order to accomplish a goal. Protagonist is in constant danger from shady Antagonist, who usually has issues of his own, probably psychological, usually also sexual and religious. Antagonist always seeks to change the world in a negative way, either by altering the world\u2019s perception of something it holds dear, or by endangering lives. Protagonist is nearly always fooled by the presence of a Traitor, who hides in plain sight as a kind, intelligent, and resourceful person until it is time to do the betraying. There are five million plot twists. Protagonist saves the world with his brain (never his brawn). Protagonist and Girl ride off into sunset (this part is metaphorical.) The End. His books are similarly easy to riff on, and <+++>Inferno</+++> is no exception. Actually, as the fourth <---C>Robert Langdon</---C> book, it\u2019s the easiest, because it\u2019s becoming increasingly obvious through repetition what his limited repertoire of tricks consists of. Namely: Repetitive plot, repetitive characters, the traitor, the global organization, the puzzle plot (for no reason at all in this one seemingly), etc, etc. See above formula. But the Langdon books in particular have their own special vocabulary. For Langdon himself, you can\u2019t go two pages without one of the following being mentioned: the Harris Tweed that he wears (in apparent defiance of the establishment which scorns the apparel as \u2018nerdy\u2019?), his Mickey Mouse watch, the fact that he is in exceptional shape for his age because he swims every morning, his great head of hair (something always noted by other characters, not Langdon himself), having characters applaud or notice how handsome Langdon is, young chicks falling for him all the time, and my personal favorite, how the only thing he thinks about besides his scholarly pursuits is that one time as a child he got stuck in a well, and apparently he never really left. It\u2019s apparent to me that Dan Brown clearly works out his own fantasies, desires, and frustrations in the pages of his books. Bottom line: there\u2019s a lot to criticize in a Dan Brown book. HOWEVER. (This is where this review will take a 180 and flip positions, so if you\u2019re one of those people who are uncomfortable admitting that even the worst written book might have something worthwhile to offer (THE PLEBES AND THE STUPIDS LIKE IT SO I MUST NEVER) back out from this page slowly and go elsewhere on the interwebs.) Here is my point to counteract \u2013 or maybe encompass is the better word \u2013 the points above. Even if the above points are true, and I believe they are, they do not affect my enjoyment of the book. Look, you don\u2019t read a Dan Brown novel for great writing. You just don\u2019t***. You read a Dan Brown novel to be carried along on a plot going the same exact speed of one of those fancy foreign high-speed trains. You read a Dan Brown book to see historical facts and famous pieces of art placed in new context, or maybe just to learn something. You read it for the secrets and the conspiracies and the ridiculously high stakes the plot hinges on. You read it for the red herrings and the betrayals. (If you\u2019re like me, you also read it so that every time Dan Brown writes something with a Dan Brown flair, you can shake your head or laugh loudly or use whatever sort of exclamations you prefer \u2013 Oh, Dan Brown , you say, mentally patting him on the head with simultaneous affection and frustration.) You read it to find out what crazy thing he\u2019s written about next, and to find out just how many and what types of people he\u2019s going to piss off next. You read it to be fucking entertained. In that respect, this book is pretty much a success. *** If Dan Brown is your paragon for good writing, please for the love of God send me an email or a private message or a tweet, and I will provide you with a list of alternatives with which to raise your standards. Also, for as much shit as people give Dan Brown, I think he\u2019s good at quite a lot of things that get overlooked most of the time. He\u2019s really good at research, for one thing \u2013 the wealth of historical detail he uncovers in his books is extremely thorough, and I\u2019d be willing to bet the amounts of information he uncovers that he doesn\u2019t put in his books is rather large. I also think it\u2019s notable that the historical and artistic bits he does include are nearly always very interesting. For another thing, in terms of the genre he\u2019s writing in (the thriller), his writing is top notch. I\u2019ve read a lot of thrillers by other authors, and in comparison, Dan Brown is something of a wordsmith. On a related note, the purpose of the thriller is to thrill \u2014 to create suspense. So while one might consider his short chapters that 99% of the time end in cliffhangers as \u2018hacky,\u2019 you might also want to consider them \u2018effective\u2019. They serve their purpose \u2014 they get you to turn the page. And finally, and maybe most significantly, Dan Brown has a definite talent for finding our cultural panic buttons and then pushing on them real hard. The effect of this is that he works through in his novels issues that we face every day, and he does so in a venue that can be sold candy-coated to a consumer mass public that would otherwise barf up similar information in reflexive panic. The last thing I want to say about Dan Brown and this book is the reason that I ended up giving it four stars instead of three. That reason is ballsiness. He tries to break up his formula in this one, and in some ways he succeeds. It was an interesting experiment in Inferno to have the plot start with Langdon unable to recall where he is or why he\u2019s in Italy, with a gunshot wound to the head. From there, he has to piece together his recent past and solve a mystery he\u2019s already solved once before all over again. This adds an extra layer of confusion to the plot that his previous three Langdon books were missing. He also shakes up his infamous traitor plot a little, but I won\u2019t say too much more about that just in case you\u2019re going to read it for yourself. But the most significant reason I say he has balls is the ending to this book. (view spoiler) [In thrillers like this one, the hero always saves the day. The world is returned to its status quo, maybe a little richer, maybe a little more cynical, depending on whose book it is you\u2019re reading. But he always succeeds in whatever madcap tomfoolery he\u2019s been participating in. But in this one? Uh, he doesn\u2019t. Langdon and his associates attempt to stop the mass dispersal of a virus that will sterilize 1/3 of the world\u2019s population for all time, and they fail. This means that any future Langdon book will take place in a world that has been irrevocably changed. (hide spoiler) ] I mean, that\u2019s just unheard of in this genre. I won\u2019t get into the politics of it, but in terms of story, I really think that ending saved this book. I could probably go on, but as this is my 52nd review of the year and it\u2019s almost 2,000 words, I think I\u2019ll just leave it at that. (I still kind of want to throw spitballs at the back of Dan Brown\u2019s thick head of hair.

The \"formula\" (which is what I hope Brown names his next Langdon book). If we're lucky, it will also have at least 100 chapters, each one ending on a note that makes us think of SNL's Really!?! with Seth and Amy skits.

By the fourth book in the series, the formula has been well-established: Robert Langdon, the intrepid Harvard professor and \u201csymbologist,\u201d must race against the clock to decode a series of obscure clues left by a madman to save humanity from destruction. The only thing surprising is that Langdon continues to be dumbfounded when he finds messages from shadowy cabals hidden in the pockets of his Harris Tweed. You\u2019d think he\u2019d be used to it by now. Unfortunately, the book reads as part dressed-up travelogue, part Wikipedia entry. On the plus side, much of the discussion is about Florence, one of my favorite cities. Brown does name-check some good places (I\u2019d agree with him that \u201cNo trip to the piazza [della Signoria] was complete without sipping an espresso at Caff\u00e8 [sic] Rivoire.\u201d) The problem is that these observations about Florentine tourist destinations are interspersed with scenes of our valiant heroes racing through the narrow streets, fleeing heavily armed paramilitary operatives who want to kill them. Langdon is never too distracted to pontificate about history and Renaissance art, but it's probably more likely that he would give the Frommer\u2019s a rest during this particular tour. (view spoiler) [ (hide spoiler) ] Brown seems fixated on this statue of Hercules in the Palazzo Vecchio. It is rather. . . gripping. Picture hidden in spoiler because NSFW. Not safe for anybody really. The real disappointment, though, is in the lost opportunity. A Dante-inspired thriller has a lot of possibilities, but this novel is strangely bloodless. It\u2019s just a prolonged scavenger hunt (view spoiler) [that turns out to be pointless (hide spoiler) ] designed to show off all the places Brown researched. I\u2019m sure he had fun doing the research, but he never gives us more than any decent guidebook would. Brown has so much potential material, with the city of Dante, Michelangelo, Machiavelli, the Medici, and Savonarola. What he comes up with, though, is bland and forgettable. His bad guy doesn\u2019t come close to stacking up against either history\u2019s bad guys or Dante\u2019s imagination. I don't think anyone reads Dan Brown's books expecting literary masterpieces, but a little excitement and unpredictability wouldn't hurt anyone. I did read, though, that they locked the translators for this book in a secret bunker in Milan while they toiled at their work. It\u2019s perhaps a bit too easy to draw an analogy between that and The Divine Comedy , so I\u2019ll refrain, but maybe it could be the seed for Brown\u2019s next book? Death mask of Dante Alighieri, Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. Pivotal to the story. (view spoiler) [Or it would have been if Langdon's clue decryption actually made any difference to the outcome.

And This time all that is not for the sake of Vatican Cardinals, or to unlock a code kept hidden by secret successors of the Knights Templar, or saving The Mason's Secrets.. This time it's for the sake of the Globe...The World we're living in. The Plot ********* Based on a hell of a theory by 19th century Malthus , predicted the real current chaos of the global over population and its hell of consequences, the story get its hell of plot, which as I said more dangerous,really darker than ever and even more confusing. For me the light Dan shed on this problem really scared the hell out of me. and encrusting it with Dante's Inferno wasn't really helping but to increase the fear of the future... Actually that made me a bit confused and somehow taking side with the 'villain' in this novel...it was a serious dilemma , I didn't know how I really want this novel to end.. But Dan Brown really know how to make a suitable ending, as I loved his ending in his Debut Novel 'Digital Fortress' cause let's admit that ending a bomb in the last 3 seconds is silly ending unless it's done smartly and perfect... I won't say more about the plot, since I think telling even the tiniest bit of it would be a bit of spoiler of the thrilling novel. ---------------------- The Symbols ********* Though it's different since the very early beginning...as Dan Brown choice was of work of literal, as he said at the Illustrated Edition preface.. Yet it still packed with Historical, Symbols and Art references The splendid tour/chase in the early morning of Florence.. The amazing perfect choice of Venice to be a metaphor for the crises of over population. Venice hosted a staggering number of tourists every year\u2014an estimated one-third of 1 percent of the world\u2019s population\u2014some twenty million visitors in the year 2000. With the additional billion added to the earth\u2019s population since that year, the city was now groaning under the weight of three million more tourists per year. Venice, like the planet itself, had only a finite amount of space, and at some point would no longer be able to import enough food, dispose of enough waste, or find enough beds for all those who wanted to visit it. Even the small glimpse of Philippines with the metaphor of the inferno of Malthus' Theory. And that other great metaphor of the New met the Old, East met the West , the Christian art met the Islamic symbols..the End of our Journey here..Turkey. All these secret places, and marvellous golden Art , Halls and Buildings.. Mixing that all as usual with the thriller packed novel.. The Characters ************** Characters here was perfect too... the special mind of Sienna Brooks leads Robert Langdon just as Vargil leads Dante through his Inferno... The Silver Beauty of Life and Health verses the Mask of Death...the Transhumanist ambitious..who turned manic - Again I can't blame him much, I almost turned one like him reading this novel. Those characters will help in other kind of references, science, medical information, trivial ones about how mind work and the conversion from dark topics -like this novel- to lighter ones ,say Cute Cats Videos.. Even highly intellectual users displayed an instinctual tendency toward denial. According to the study, the vast majority of university students, after clicking on a depressing news article about arctic ice melt or species extinction, would quickly exit that page in favor of something trivial that purged their minds of fear; favorite choices included sports highlights, funny cat videos, and celebrity gossip. And of course Every Character is deep enough ...and surprises are always guaranteed with Dan Brown.. (view spoiler) [The shocking scene of the \"gay love scene\" and the characters 'reverse' is really mind blowing, loved it sooo much.

Yet It's perfect to me ... as satisfying as having a watch for Christmas of my favorite character :) As I said I was facing the same mixing feeling about how I wanted his Debut Novel 'Digital Fortress' would end..And same here.. and Dan Brown really made it right.

Measuring nine-and-a-half by six-and-a-quarter by one-and-a-half inches, the object was encased in a shiny substance the overweight reviewer knew to be plastic. A book of some kind. To the little known reader\u2019s brilliant mind and eidetic memory, identifying the book was a simple task. The labels affixed to the spine proclaimed its origin: the library. It was adorned with the terrifying profile of a red-cheeked man in a red cap and red cloak, surmounted by a series of concentric circles. Red . . . The color of blood. And those circle things look like a target. The reviewer\u2019s hands trembled as her fingers traced the bold lettering on the book\u2019s cover. \u201cDAN BROWN . . . INFERNO.\u201d I have to review this?! The reviewer knew that Dan Brown (born June 22, 1964) is an American author of thriller fiction who is best known for the 2003 bestselling novel, The Da Vinci Code. Brown's novels are treasure hunts set in a 24-hour period, and feature the recurring themes of cryptography, keys, symbols, codes, and conspiracy theories. His books have been translated into 52 languages, and as of 2012, sold over 200 million copies. Two of them, The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, have been adapted into films. I copied that straight out of Wikipedia. CHAPTER 2 I am holding Inferno by Dan Brown and I have to review it, the plump, somewhat scruffily dressed, middle-aged woman recapped. Terror made her nauseous, but she bravely looked at her Goodreads updates to refresh her memory, reading the scathing comments she had left only days ago on the popular readers\u2019 Web site. Dan Brown is going to kill me! The female reviewer recalled that Dan Brown is currently the twentieth highest selling author of all time and with only six books, he has achieved these sales writing fewer books than anyone above him on the list. The Robert Langdon series is currently the seventh highest selling series of all time. Like Dan Brown, I do most of my research on the Web. Not the Internet. Dan Brown likes to talk about the Web. It sounds more . . . spidery. The married reviewer felt an instant spark of attraction toward the sandy-haired author, who always seems to be wearing a tweed jacket in his photo shoots. Could he be Robert Langdon in disguise? CHAPTER 3 Overreacting wildly, the obscure critic overreacted for a few minutes, then got a grip on herself and scanned her updates. She noted that renowned author Dan Brown tends to get his tenses confused, loves to put identifiers in front of his characters\u2019 names, and is inordinately fond of ellipses and loud punctuation such as exclamation points, question marks and interrobangs. Why is that?! Oh yes, and he loves italics, which pop up all over the place, not always readily identifiable with one particular character. CHAPTER 4 The practically unknown reviewer picked up her copy of Inferno by Dan Brown, scanning its mysterious cover with the picture of the sage she now knew to be internationally famous poet Dante (c. 1265\u20131321), who was a major Italian poet of the Middle Ages. His Divine Comedy , originally called La Comedia and later called Divina by Boccaccio, is widely considered the greatest literary work composed in the Italian language and a masterpiece of world literature. Gad, I love Wikipedia. She remembered that bestselling author Dan Brown frequently recaps the previous action near the beginning of a chapter, and that his bestselling prose is scattered with information dumps so densely constituted that they resemble the excreta of the famed Friesian horse, a creature mentioned in the bestselling novel Inferno . The reviewer\u2019s eidetic memory roamed over the plot. She recalled that Robert Langdon, granite-jawed Harvard professor of symbology and art historian specializing in iconography, wakes up in Florence to find that he remembers nothing, people are apparently trying to kill him, and he is carrying a suggestively shaped container that contains a mysterious object. He is helped by pretty blonde ponytailed genius-IQd Sienna Brooks, who has the hots for him. And his confused memories recall a mysterious silver-haired attractive older woman who wants him to seek and find, and who undoubtedly will have the hots for him too. Meanwhile, on the mysterious ship The Mendacium, facilitator Knowlton has just watched a video that is more terrifying than the most terrifying thing you can possibly imagine. Dan Brown is fond of making his characters react with terror in the hope that the reader will also be terrified? What is this book?! CHAPTER 5 \u201cAh yes!\u201d the clinically obese woman derided, not knowing that \u201cderide\u201d must have an object. She recalled that most of the plot of Inferno consisted of Langdon and Sienna running around famous tourist spots finding clues, while being chased by a leather-clad woman who turns out to be superfluous to the plot, a bleeding strangely dressed man who also, honestly, didn\u2019t have much of a role except to increase dramatic tension, and some black-clad soldiers who weren\u2019t really necessary either, except that they get to do all the dirty work like good little minions. As they pass various monuments, Langdon recalls large indigestible lumps of architectural and historical detail. As the story lumbers to its end it picks up speed, with one quite nice bit of misdirection but otherwise the usual thriller fare of all the important stuff being packed into the last few pages so that the reader feels like a lot went on. And then there was the ending . . . CHAPTER 6 \u201cI was outraged,\u201d the reviewer recalled, outraged. How could everyone suddenly decide that the Evil Plan may, in fact, be a Jolly Good Thing? Why was the Evil Villain\u2019s Number One not banged up in jail but instead allowed to work for the good guys? And didn\u2019t Dan Brown think through what he was proposing as Quite A Good Thing, Really?! The reviewer ran her hands over the shiny cover of the bestselling novel Inferno by Dan Brown. She recalled that Langdon rides off smugly into the sunset of a brand new world without any thought for the social, economic, and religious consequences of what just happened. Not to mention the fact that a small bunch of white people take it upon themselves to re-engineer the fate of mankind without consulting the rest of the world. And that\u2019s supposed to be OK because they\u2019re white, rich, and brilliant. CHAPTER 7 The overweight woman gnashed her teeth dramatically and then, like renowned professor of symbology Robert Langdon, decided to settle down with a good book. Sensing it was time to wrap up her interminable review, there was one thought that still haunted her. Dan Brown knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. The frequent recaps so the reader doesn\u2019t lose his way . . . the italics that also serve as simplified reminders of what\u2019s going on . . . the way the action takes place in tourist spots that are easily visited and quite easy to research . . . the very short chapters . . . the dropping of brand names . . . He\u2019s manipulating the Baby Boomers!?! The reviewer realized that for an audience accustomed to a diet of CSI and the Discovery Channel, Dan Brown\u2019s storytelling style is accessible and informative. Used to being given the potted version of history by talking heads as the camera zooms around in a dizzying series of filler shots, the average reader of Brown\u2019s books will sink into a TV-induced-like stupor and, instead of thinking about the plot or the writing, will simply enjoy the experience and come back for more. And that, thought the reviewer, is why Dan Brown is the novelist of the future. Sensing it was time, really, to revert to a state of denial before that last thought took hold in her brain, the reviewer took one last look at the cover of the bestselling novel Inferno and sighed. I can return it to the library and forget this ever happened . . . ...more This is my first Dan Brown book and what can I say...it pretty much sucked. I was kind of shocked. Yes, I had read a lot of disparaging comments about Brown\u2019s writing, but I pushed them aside, figuring his books must be at least entertaining. Otherwise why would he be so popular?

Yes, I had read a lot of disparaging comments about Brown\u2019s writing, but I pushed them aside, figuring his books must be at least entertaining. Otherwise why would he be so popular? And I rather like cheesy books. This one had a condescending tone though that grated on my nerves and sapped all the fun right out of the story. It was a tedious read. Brown\u2019s characters are boring. There\u2019s no depth or nuisance. Everybody talks and thinks alike. Their dialogue has no individuality. There are no intricate, personality conflicts. Brown also has the annoying tendency to tell you how brilliant and amazing his characters are ALL THE TIME, but he never really shows you why they are extraordinary. Then there are the endless info dumps. OMG! Brown gives a Humanities lecture for every museum Langdon goes to (even when his characters are running for their lives). They\u2019re not short little vignettes either that give character and life to a place. No they\u2019re long dry passages that seem to be cut and pasted straight from a travel brochure. Brown will use half a page to describe a statue that has NOTHING to do with the plot. I found his description on Botticelli\u2019s Map of Hell to be somewhat questionable too. My God! Langdon\u2019s hand trembled slightly as he absorbed the macabre scene projected on the wall before him. No wonder I\u2019ve been seeing images of death. At his side, Sienna covered her mouth and took a tentative step forward, clearly entranced by what she was seeing. The scene projected was a grim oil painting of human suffering\u2014thousands of souls undergoing wretched tortures in various levels of hell. The underworld was portrayed as a cutaway across section of the earth into which plunged a cavernous funnel-shaped pit of unfathomable depth. This pit of hell was divided into descending terraces of increasing misery, each level populated by tormented sinners of every kind. Dark, grim, and terrifying \u2026 Botticelli had crafted his Map of Hell with a depressing palate of reds, sepias, and browns.\u201d What the hell is Brown talking about? The people are teeny weeny! How could Langdon and Sienna even see them? Yes I know it\u2019s a nit. But it made me wonder\u2026 were all of Brown\u2019s boring info dumps crap? They better not be, damn it! (To be honest, I didn\u2019t bother to check). But if you\u2019re going bore the snot out of me, at least make sure you\u2019re boring me with accurate information. The plot is probably the best part of this book. There were some twists and turns I didn\u2019t see coming, and Brown practically ends every chapter in a cliff hanger, so the book kept moving. There are so many plot holes though, it was like a sponge. If you think too much about it, you\u2019ll spend all your time rolling your eyes and fall out of your chair. In the end, I\u2019m amazed that Brown is a bestselling author. His writing is terrible. He tells instead of shows. He repeats everything at least twice, sometimes three or four times. He describes three amazing European cites, but doesn\u2019t bring any of them to life. And his story starts up an interesting conversation about population and the apocalypse, but Brown never gives it any real thought. The ending was so sanctimonious and preachy, I wanted to toss the book across the room. Maybe without the book\u2019s snooty tone, this could have been a fun and cheesy read, but Brown takes himself way too seriously. I give 1 \u00bd stars.

Malthus lives, and has spawned a group of die-hard Transhumanists who think we and our planet would be a lot better off were there significantly fewer of us using up space, air, water, et al, and hogging the remotes. Robert Langdon, returned to duty after sundry life-threatening adventures in Angels & Demons , The Da Vinci Code , and The Lost Symbol , has been called in to decipher the clues to where and how Mister Zobrist, (we can\u2019t call him The Shade for 463 pages, can we?) conveniently dead in the opening, has set his viral bomb to go off. Or was he? Langdon wakes up in an ER, with a head wound, a distinctly fuzzy recollection of the recent past and thinks he is back in Massachusetts. Brunelleschi didn't design any buildings in New England. That large dome you see out the window means you are in Florence. Oops. And, by the way, there is a well armed, nicely leather-clad biker person heading down the hall, weapons blazing. Check please. He and Doc McSmokin\u2019, a 208 IQ, blonde, pony-tailed physician, named Sienna Brooks, dash out ahead of the ordnance and the game is afoot. This offers an example of something that is entirely depressing. Had that been an American hospital there is no way he could have gotten out without having to sign insurance forms or promissory notes, guns blazing or not. (Mister Langdon. We need you to sign here, here, here, and initial here, here and here. You, with the gun, take a number and have a seat.) Woodward and Bernstein, in All the Presidents Men , report on G. Gordon Liddy holding his hand over a flame at a dinner party to impress someone or other. He held it long enough to singe himself, and cause alarm in those present. When he was asked \u201cWhat\u2019s the trick?\u201d he answered, \u201cThe trick is not minding.\u201d Reading a book of Daniel Brown\u2019s is a far cry from holding one\u2019s hand over an open flame. But there are elements to reading his work that are certainly painful. There are benefits to be had, things to be learned, issues to be raised, but there are clich\u00e9s to be endured, characterizations to be tolerated, dei ex machina to be ignored. I suppose one might think of it as a form of Purgatory. You can certainly enjoy the good while putting up with the bad. The trick is not minding the latter. One does not descend into reading Dan Brown\u2019s infernal novel expecting literary power. There are certain formulae at work, and if you are not prepared to be led along, keeping the blinders firmly affixed for the duration, you might do better to read something else with the several hours it takes to work your way through the levels in Inferno . (Yes, there are some) We do not expect to find work similar to that of, say, Louise Erdrich, or Ron Rash, and it would be unfair, not to say unkind, to apply to Brown the metrics applied to writers of more serious fiction. But then, what standards should we apply? There are two general qualities that merit our attention here, and more specific elements within each. Is it entertaining? Is it informative? Entertaining Does the story engage out attention? Or do we find ourselves wandering off? Is it fast-paced? Do we care about the characters? Is it fun? In short, does this make a good beach read? Informative Does it teach us something new? Is the information interesting? Does it address some larger issue, one of actual significance? Does it make sense? ENTERTAINMENT Does the story engage our attention? Sure. While not, for me at least, as engaging as The DaVinci Code , I kept turning all 463 pages, eager to find out what there was to be found, info and plot-wise. But I was not exactly panting to get back to the book at every free moment. Is it fast-paced? Is the Pope Argentinian? This is what Brown does. Aside from the sort of occasional interruptions that might give the wearer of a pace-maker the sweats, (noted in more detail below) he keeps things moving along. I was reminded of an old (1912) adventure tale, A Princess of Mars , by Edgar Rice Burroughs. That book was also a series. Battle, capture, rescue, escape, repeat, with bits of information about some underlying subject in the book tossed in to grease the narrative wheels. Ditto here. Speaking of greasing, you will need to have some eye drops handy to avoid chafing from frequent eye-rolling. It seems that every time there is a need to gain access to some large institution, Brown trots out what seems almost a running joke of Robert Langdon having some relationship with the person in charge. I bet if Langdon needed 3am access to the UFO museum in Roswell, we would learn that he had tracked aliens with the museum director and had contributed a live specimen from the Crab Nebula at some time in the not too distant past. The Sulabh International Museum of Toilets? It wasn\u2019t Washington who poohed there, or presented a monograph at the esteemed institution that resulted in such a large inflow of contributions that the institution was flush for a considerable period. In a related matter, I was reminded of two cinematic clich\u00e9s in particular. In one, the hero and heroine pause as the world collapses around them to engage in a lengthy soulful smooch. (Pay no attention to that incoming missile. Enjoy.) In the second, a child dashes back to the burning-building or alien-infested-spaceship to retrieve her (choose one - favorite stuffy, kitten, puppy, photo of long dead (but really only missing) mother or father). Brown spares us kittens and overlong liplocks, for the most part, but while Langdon and this volume\u2019s Bond girl are dashing from persistent threats like a Florida race track rabbit, (who are those dogs?) Brown pauses the action every so often, inserts himself and his research into the narrative (Bob, Si, relax. We\u2019ll pick this up again after lunch), and offers up the occasional art history lesson. I\u2019m not saying that these are not informative and sometimes fun (as in the case of a particularly organ-rich Plaza della Signoria) The Fountain of Neptune from The Museums of Florence but it does alter the flow in a breathlessly paced novel to\u2026um\u2026take a breather. All right guys, up and at \u2018em. Ready, set, flee. Do we care about the characters? Truthfully, it is tough not to care about a character that has the face of Tom Hanks ironed onto it, but yeah, I guess, although a lot less than a whole lot of other fictional people. It is fun to see Langdon attempting to recover his memory and figure out who that mysterious woman he keeps seeing in vision-flashes might be. Sienna Galore has a pretty interesting back-story, a large brain, and the usual physical assets required for Brown\u2019s kicked-up Bond-girl roles. So sure, why not. Aside from those two, only a little here and there. Character is not the thing in Dan Brown books. Is it fun? As a straight up read, forgetting for the moment one\u2019s analytical inclinations, yes. Brown does revel in puzzles and there are more secrets embedded in Inferno than there are candied items in a fruit cake. And some are quite delicious. (OK, I hereby out myself as a weirdo who likes fruit cake). Unlike one\u2019s experience with fruit cake, however, you will miss out on that weighty feeling of having ingested a brick. Literarily, Inferno is a lot more like chiffon cake than its denser cousin. Also there are enough twists to keep the cap machines at the Nogara Coke bottling factory busy for a long time. Does it make a good beach read? Assolutamente INFORMATION Does it teach us something new? Si! We learn of a mysterious transnational entity, that Brown swears is based on a real organization, that smoothes out the curves so that people of questionable motives, but certain resources, can go about their business unimpeded. The head of this group might have been well served with a fluffy white kitty and a pinky ring. Brown offers some nifty tour guides to this and that location in several cities, and a fair bit of history on Dante and his most famous bit of writing. He offers some illuminating details on this or that building, painting and sculpture, including where it might have traveled over the centuries (well, not the buildings, of course) and whether the version we see today is a fully original specimen. He also gives us a very good reason to take a tour of the secret passageways in Old World cities. The Vasari Corridor from Wiki commons Is the information interesting? Leaving aside prophets and their like, before there were mononymous sorts like Liberace, Elvis and Madonna, even earlier than sorts like that English playwright, there was Durante degli Aligheri, known to a certain childhood acquaintance, Beatrice, as that boy who wouldn\u2019t stop staring at her, known to certain priors in Florence as the guy who refused to pay his fine and was thus banned for life, and known to us in the 21st century as Dante. Dante and His Poem by Michelino from Wikimedia If you find Dante and his best-known work of interest, and really, you should, this book is a lot of fun. Of course what constitutes interesting is almost always in the eye of the beholder. If your thing is video games, well then not so much. (on the other hand, there actually is a lot here that does remind one of video game action, so I take that back) But if you are fascinated with old world history, art and architecture, Dante, the Black Death, Malthusian concerns, and the potential impact of a large human die-off, then Si, molto . Does it address some larger issue, one of actual significance? Sicuramente . Two in fact. One of the major elements in the story is the determination by our psycho-scientist billionaire sort that human population is about to reach a dangerous level, one which is likely to trigger all sorts of catastrophes. There are various ways one can address this concern, but the underlying concern is quite real. Brown does us all a service by bringing it to the attention of millions of readers. Another element here is the notion of \u201cTranshumanism.\u201d Basically this entails humans taking charge of our own evolution and using all the technology available to us to ensure maximization of our physical and intellectual capacities. Whether one sees this as a Satanic plot, yet another opportunity for the haves to have even more, or the beginning of a new human renaissance, the subject is worth checking out. Does it make sense? In some ways yes and in some ways no. There is validity to the underlying science. But would the baddie really leave a breadcrumb trail for potential foilers to his big bang? That said, it can be fun to descend into the bowels of the earth, or the watery substructures of ancient architectural marvels, however many levels down you care to go. Whether you think that Dan Brown belongs in literary heaven, Hades or somewhere in between, he makes a wonderful Virgil, leading us on an interesting journey, and showing us some things we might not have ever imagined. It may not qualify as a divine book, but Inferno is one hell of a read. PS - One must note that the end of all three parts of Dante\u2019s Commedia (the Divine was added later) end with the word \u201cstars.\u201d Brown does not disappoint on that score. And I am sure there is significance to the fact that there are 104 chapters in the book, (plus a prologue and an epilogue, so 106) but I have not been able to suss out exactly what. There are 99 cantos in the Commedia , maybe a couple more with this or that added, but I do not know how one can fluff that up to 106. Yet, I am sure there is an explanation. When (if) I find it I will include it here.

At the beginning I found it a little bit annoying when every single details of various Italian tourist spots were being described.

Unfortunately Inferno reads more like a movie treatment with some factoids thrown in. At times it reminded me of the old Batman episodes with the caped crusader pulling off an implausible escape from the bad guys every 5 minutes. On the plus side, Brown does give Dante a pretty good treatment for the reader not familiar with the Commedia. I also enjoyed the whirlwind tour of the city (having visited Florence last year). Inferno continues to follow Brown's style of page-turning, very short chapters and I have to admit I got sucked in. On the minus side, the book is replete with the usual anti-Catholic bigotry (although not as bad as Da Vinci Code). And of course, there's the writing. Brown's writing isn't as bad as some of the critics say (including some readers of this site), but Brown certainly isn't writing literary fiction either. I'm not a Brown hater, but I have to wonder what Dante's Inferno would have looked like in the hands of Umberto Eco. Afterlife: An Introduction to Dante's Inferno ...more To be very honest, I had a lot of expectations from this book and Dan Brown does not disappoint. I'm not entirely happy with the book; the second half of the book lacked certain things and was not quite as interesting as the first part. The research work for this book is done very painstakingly and it shows. 4.5 stars. I considered giving this two stars but then I realized there really wasn't anything I liked about it. It was so boring and it took me more than a week to get through. I know it's too much to ask that Dan Brown scale the heights of Angels & Demons or even The Da Vinci Code once again but I'm somewhat baffled as to how his writing has taken a turn for the worse and it started with that blasted The Lost Symbol . There's nothing much to say about this to be honest. The plot was kind of intriguing I considered giving this two stars but then I realized there really wasn't anything I liked about it.

There's nothing much to say about this to be honest. The plot was kind of intriguing mostly because it raised ethical questions and provided food for thought but the characters were so underdeveloped and felt really flat. As a result of this, I wasn't invested in any of them or the story. It all just plodded along with me quirking an eyebrow here and there and wondering when it was going to end. I certainly don't understand why it took so many pages to tell this very mediocre story. As it usually goes with Dan Brown books this read like a tour of ancient buildings in ancient cities and while these would have been great to explore on a tour in person or even read in a guide book, Brown does a terrible job of interweaving the story and these 'attractions' Would I recommend this to anyone? Not really. There's nothing to see here so I would encourage you to keep it moving. ...more Aaron turned on his computer and opened it to Goodreads.com, a widely used website for books. It was time. He looked around to be sure he was alone, and started writing ... his review of Dan Brown's Inferno. CHAPTER 253 Aaron looked at the screen, wondering how best to approach the review. He had to be quick about it. \"There's no time!\" he shouted even though no one else was around. They could be here at any minute, and he had to hurry. He had to make sure he went fast, because of the time constrain Aaron turned on his computer and opened it to Goodreads.com, a widely used website for books. It was time. He looked around to be sure he was alone, and started writing ... his review of Dan Brown's Inferno. CHAPTER 253 Aaron looked at the screen, wondering how best to approach the review. He had to be quick about it. \"There's no time!\" he shouted even though no one else was around. They could be here at any minute, and he had to hurry. He had to make sure he went fast, because of the time constraints. Speed was of the utmost importance. But ... how to start? While it was true that he had enjoyed the facts listed in the book, he wasn't sure this was enough to warrant a good review. \"Lists of facts do not a novel make,\" he chuckled to himself, very very proud of this turn of phrase. Again, to be clear, no one else was around. He was alone and talking to himself. He started writing his review. The first thing he pointed out was that no one in the book spoke like a human being. \"More like anthropomorphic Wikipedia entries,\" he chuckled again, remembering how essentially the characters only speak to each other when they have knowledge to share. Except at least Wikipedia entries straight-up tell you what you want to know, instead of posing everything as a Jeopardy question and lording the answer over you when you don't get it right. But then Aaron started hurrying again because of how fast he definitely needed to be going because of the vague and undefined threat listed earlier in this review. Suddenly, Aaron was reminded of something from his past. He leaned back in his chair and just kind of stared into space for a whole chapter (so about 2 or 3 pages) remembering every single word from a speech he gave like 10 years ago. Luckily, that speech has the answers to everything he'll ever need to do to stop his vague and undefined enemies, so this is not strictly a waste of time. Aaron looked up from his computer. Was that a sound that he'd heard? Probably. Sounds happen all the time. Wait! There it was again! He tried to slam the laptop closed to hide his work, but it was too late. They were here. CHAPTER 591 Aaron tried to run, but as he got up a hand grabbed him from behind and pushed him back into his chair. He turned around. Above him stood a beautiful woman, with many attractive features that you, the male reader, would probably enjoy. \"Aaron Burdette!\" she shouted. \"I'm such a huge fan of yours! I just came by to tell you that I mostly exist to tell you how smart and attractive you are. I probably have some sort of surface-level trait like 'I'm really smart' or 'I'm barren' to inform my 'character', but really I'm just totally into you.\" \"Thank you human woman,\" Aaron replied. \"But... aren't you here to... kill... me?\" \"No!\" she said, her golden hair glistening or something. \"There are no real threats in this story! Just things that SEEM like threats, but then end up being fine.\" \"Oh, good. I love a story with net zero stakes.\" \"Then you're gonna love this.\" And then, the woman who we all thought was beautiful and smart and cool, pulled a gun on Aaron Burdette. CHAPTER 12 MILLION \"Just kidding!\" shouted the woman, immediately throwing her gun in the nearby Hudson River. The Hudson River is a 315-mile (507 km) watercourse that flows from north to south primarily through eastern New York State in the United States. The river originates at Henderson Lake in Newcomb, New York, in the Adirondack Park, flowing southward past the state capital at Albany, and eventually forming the boundary between New York City and the U.S. state of New Jersey at its mouth, before emptying into Upper New York Bay. The official hydrologic source of the Hudson River is Lake Tear of the Clouds in the Adirondack Mountains.[4] The lower half of the river is a tidal estuary[5] occupying the Hudson Fjord, which formed during the most recent period of North American glaciation, estimated at 26,000 to 13,300 years ago.[6] Tidal waters influence the Hudson's flow from as far north as Troy, New York. \"Sorry, what did you say?\" Aaron asked. \"I was just thinking about the Hudson River.\" \"I said 'Just kidding,'\" said the mysterious woman whose name we still don't know. \"Because I'm not really going to kill you.\" \"Oh, that's good. I guess I will have no emotional reaction to any of this.\" \"Me neither.\" They shook hands. Then the woman left. \"I never found out her name,\" Aaron said out loud. \"I bet since that sort of information is being withheld, it will really be a big shock later in the story when her name is finally revealed. Like, I should've known who she was all along or something.\" Nope, that woman's name was Amber Smith and you have never met her before. There is no discernible reason to have withheld her name. \"Oh,\" Aaron said. \"Well at least this will be the only time that happens.\" If only Aaron could know ... how wrong he truly was. CHAPTER INFINITY \"I have to hurry, remember?!\" Aaron shouted. For you see, Aaron had to release his review soon. He had to. Because ... if he didn't ... the whole world might end... up reading Inferno. It was on Aaron, a humble book reviewer on a social media site, the kind of guy that you would never, ever think would end up in a world-saving scenario, to stop everyone on earth from reading a book. \"Just read a non-fiction book about Florence or Venice or Renaissance Art!\" he cried to the heavens/empty room. \"That's the only good stuff in here anyway!\" He rapidly pushed the keys on his keyboard, making them make the words pop up on the screen thanks to various input codes sent from the keyboard to the computer. Finally, he finished. With the simple click of a mouse, he would release his warning to mankind. Only time would tell ... if it worked.

And also, into a closet tourist guide - a tourist guide who will bore the sweaty and itchy tourists into a rigid stupor as he drones on, ad nauseum , about every gilt-edged pillar and every conspiracy-ridden niche that the museums of Italy seem to be overflowing with. And might I add that the plot was non-existent. So my reaction at the complete absence of a storyline began at a mild: laboured along at a steady: and eventually escalated into a full-blown: But wait, there was more\u2026 200 Pages on and we are still sifting through a sea of unnecessary facts, vapid musings of the characters and brick-by-brick descriptions of Italy\u2019s hotspots. And still, no plot. I am getting a tad snitty and mighty snotty now, Mr.Brown. Take it from here, Miss.Pony: I\u2019m trying to keep an open mind. I\u2019m trying to remember that one day, I will write a book and I will not want reviewers to tear it to soul-destroying shreds. I remind myself that Dan Brown is an articulate man with a brilliant mind. But a description of Gondolas? Which, for the record, wasn't essential to the plot. REALLY, Mr.Brown?!?

But wait, I spoke too soon. What you saw and read and believed is NOT what you saw and read and believed. Yes, big shock there, Prof.Langdon. On a parallel (but seemingly wholly unrelated) note, is the plot progressing? Nope. No sir. Not at all. It\u2019s just more pages of lectures and descriptions and yes, lectures. Stop it, Mr.Brown! Stop it. Please. I am getting big imaginary welts on my forehead with all these big imaginary medieval *headdesks* It\u2019s not right. I want to stop. But I have paid a third-cousin-twice-removed-duke\u2019s ransom for this book. I must finish it. I must. I will see the promised land. But it\u2019s a lonely path. And it\u2019s dark. *help* Why is it not ending? Why!?! Mr.Brown. STOP. Please. For the love of Angels & Demons , STOP. and... oh look, I'm done.

Not 400 agonizing, brain-numbing pages long. b) Reputed and respected Prof.Langdon is facing what could probably be the biggest catastrophe of his life. And his reactions? Dry chuckles. Startled asides. The occasional uppity smirk. Kristen Stewart. Rejoice. YOU have more expressions than Robert Langdon. c) Sienna Brooks was a huge disappointment. And really, were her actions justified? I think not. Prof.Langdon, stop acting all noble and understanding.

Why doesn't Robert Langdon ever reference his previous adventures? Wouldn't you think it'd be a huge credibility booster (and probably score some points with the cute lady he's running with here) to drop into conversation something like \"Well, I did save the world once before from an anti-matter toting lunatic, so this time it should be no sweat\" or \"Remember that time I discovered that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene? That was pretty cool.\" But, no. No I have something to ask before I start. Why doesn't Robert Langdon ever reference his previous adventures? Wouldn't you think it'd be a huge credibility booster (and probably score some points with the cute lady he's running with here) to drop into conversation something like \"Well, I did save the world once before from an anti-matter toting lunatic, so this time it should be no sweat\" or \"Remember that time I discovered that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene? That was pretty cool.\" But, no. Nothing. All we get is that he's still a symbologist, and he's still claustrophobic. That being said, lets dissect the latest piece of novel (garbage) by Dan Brown. Our good buddy Robert Langdon wakes up in a Florence hospital, having no memory of how he got there. Although he seems more upset about the loss of his Mickey Mouse watch and the bloody destruction of his favorite Harris tweed jacket. He doesn't get much time to think about it because down in the street is a spiky-haired woman in black on a motorcycle.. (wait a minute, how did the girl with the dragon tattoo get in this book?) is on a missing to kill Langdon but our poor amnesiac Langdon had no idea why. So he's on the run before he's even fully conscious. And so begin the journey of Langdon re-solving all the mysteries he solved the previous evening before he was shot in the head, which apparently caused his memory lapse. It's The Hangover, Part 4, Starring Robert Langdon! (And as much fun as that might, it's not, it's a little silly and seems a tad contrived.) This time Langdon's sidekick is the beautiful, brilliant but troubled doctor Sienna Brooks. Since Dan Brown needs to have Langdon tell us things in conversations with other people, Dr. Brooks is the unwilling victim of this edition of Langdon's Mansplaining. So we lucky readers get to follow him around, as he's chased by an assassin and evil government forces, trying to remember what the hell happened last night with frequent pauses for Langdon to deliver ponderous lectures on Dante's great work about Hell. (Yaaayy, could we BE more luckier). Now about our Madman villian. He has this cute little plan where he believes for humanity to survive, the world's population must immediately be reduced by about half so he created 21st century plague that will effectively wipe out half of the world's population (adorable). But, since evil geniuses always come with colossal egos, he can't resist leaving clues about his sinister plot. So, like any bad guy would, he not only digitally alters a Botticelli painting based on Dante's Inferno, but hides the image so it can only be read by a some glass laser tube thingy. And he doesnt just stop there. No!No! he is just getting started, ladies & Gentleman, Grab your seat and relax. Further he hides the tube thingy inside an antique seal and hides the seal inside a bio-hazard tube that can be opened only with one individual's thumbprint. Easy Peesey, what could possibly go wrong? See, The villain is not the only poor communicator here. As one of Langdon's friends lies dying, he leaves a clue for the professor not by conveying it in plain English, or even plain Italian, but by referring to a lines of Dante's poem. I know, deciphering is Langdon's bread and butter, but CAN NOT ONE PERSON IN THIS BOOK SAY WHAT THEY MEAN WITHOUT BEING CRYPTIC? Cryptic conversations aside, the characters do stunningly foolish things, and Langdon in particular is so gullible as to inspire dozens of face-palms. If you knew that bio-terrorism was possibly in play, would you get on a train and share a cozy compartment with a brand-new acquaintance whose face is covered with bleeding dangerous looking acne? Our Harvard prof (and that genius doctor) do so without a second thought. More than often, Inferno left me frustrated than enlightened. At one point, another message from the villain something cryptic like \"severed the heads from horses,\" and I wished for Langdon to recalls the horse-head-in-the-bed scene from The Godfather. I longed for a moment for Vito Corleone to show up in Inferno. He knew how to leave a clear, simple message. If I have been in any way cryptic about my revulsion for this book(garbage), forgive me, lemi just say I HATED THIS BOOK. Look Im all for awfully enjoyable book and I would recommend this book wholeheartedly if I could. But IT IS MAINLY JUST AWFUL. ...more Making this as read just so I can do a stupid review....I made it all the way to 37% I deserve a medal..... okay....I just can't finish it....it started with this paragraph at about 12% \"She knew it was probably just the adrenaline, but she found herself strangely attracted to the American professor.

I mean, this isn't even an original love twist...it's so overused....so overdone. I made it all the way to 37% before I just am done...I'm over it...kaput...no more.... So far Langdon has escaped several assassination attempts. He has managed to escape several times from places that were inescapable. So we're suppose to believe he is insanely clever, right? WRONG!!!!! When he meets up with a lady he met the night before (he has short term amnesia ...ufffta.... how very original) he has to ask her half a dozen times, \"You did, I must have overlooked that\" when she points out that they discussed it the night before. Hello! If you're trying to act like you don't have amnesia, don't question every thing she tells you from the night before, moron! I just can't take it anymore.... I honestly feel that Brown has just totally sold himself out here....He has not only recycled generic writing themes, he has used boring, unimaginative ones to boot! At this point, I can't help having visions of Harrison Ford (Indian Jones) and Matt Damon (Jason Bourne) running through my head. Where the hell is Robert Langdon? I just can't picture him. There is no clear picture of him or his personality. How dare Dan Brown assume that everyone has read the previous books. As an author I would think that you can never assume that your reading audience has read your other books. This might be the very first time they have picked up one of your novels. Yet, Brown gives us no insight to who Langdon is. What makes him tick? There simply is no inner workings to his mind or his personality here. So very disappointed....I seriously wanted to finish this book, but I've been debating with myself the entire time from that stupid paragraph until now....I mean, seriously, I'm in the middle of a paragraph and ask myself, \"Connie, how much longer are you going to go on with this rubbish?\"....guess I finally answered myself....zipt...psssfffttt...done.... adios..... ...more Warning: If something in my review is marked with a spoiler tag, it really is a spoiler.

If nothing else, Dan Brown's Inferno reminded me that the interrobang (?!) is a thing. Also, why use one ellipsis ... when you can use ... A MILLION?! I can't take this book seriously. It took me over a month to read it, and most of that month was spent snickering over what a delicate flower Robert Langdon is. Somewhere in the apartment, a phone was ringing. It was a piercing, old-fashioned ring, coming from the kitchen. \"Sienna?!\" Langdon called out, standing up. When a ringing phone startles your hero enough to warrant an interrobang, I think it's safe to say the fate of the world is doomed. I'm going to propose a controversial thesis that is 99% certain to mindfuck you into oblivion, and that thesis is that Inferno is not about Dante or Renaissance art or (view spoiler) [genetic engineering (hide spoiler) ] at all. Inferno is the simple story of one man, a \"handsome\" Harvard professor of \"symbology,\" who loses his virginity on a wild night and doesn't remember it in the morning. The only \"inferno\" in Inferno , you see, is the INFERNO in Bob Langdon's pants. DON'T LEAVE ME. I HAVE PROOF! EXHIBIT 1: The Mickey Mouse \"Timepiece\" Langdon is dismayed when he wakes up in a Florence hospital with no memory of getting there and no Mickey Mouse timepiece on his wrist. For many people, Mickey Mouse symbolizes innocence and paying over-inflated prices for food at a theme park. This is something that a world-renowned symbologist would know. Therefore, Langdon loses his \"innocence\" before the story ever starts and spends the whole book mourning it. Somehow, between then and now, he had managed to lose his clothing, his Mickey Mouse watch, and two days of his life. Dan Brown practically spells it out for us! EXHIBIT 2: The Sullying of the Harris Tweed Jacket Langdon is crushed to find that his favorite Harris Tweed jacket (what all stereotypical Harvard professors wear) has been damaged and dirtied in his forgotten adventures. In fact, the Harris Tweed jacket (view spoiler) [has a brand new hole in it! (hide spoiler) ] Obviously, the supposedly classy and cultured Harris Tweet jacket represents Bob Langdon. Obviously. EXHIBIT 3: PEEN! Sightings Bob Langdon notices every penis in Florence, and he HATES them. Now, one would think that a famed art historian and world-renowned symbologist wouldn't blush at the site of the glorious male appendage of sexing. But that's only because one doesn't know Bob Langdon. At one point, Bob compares the \"classy\" Italian graffiti on the back of a Porta Potty to the inferior graffiti in the good ol' U S of A: Most American Porta-Potties were covered with sophomoric cartoons that vaguely resembled huge breasts or penises. You would fixate on the naughty bits, wouldn't you, Bob? Normally, Langdon's visits to the Palazzo Vecchio had begun here on the Piazza della Signoria, which, despite its overabundance of phalluses, had always been one of his favorite plazas in all of Europe. Really, it's almost like he's going out of his way to be offended by the many peens of Florence. Langdon intentionally ignored the oft-maligned Hercules and Diomedes, whose naked bodies were locked in an awkward-looking wrestling match, which included a creative \"penile grip\" that always made Langdon cringe. But one mention of our \"penile gripping\" warriors isn't enough for Bob. Hercules was holding Diomedes upside down, preparing to throw him, while Diomedes was tightly gripping Hercules' penis, as if to say, \"Are you sure you want to throw me?\" So, basically, the peens in Inferno symbolize ... penises. EXHIBIT 4: (view spoiler) [This all ends up being about BIRTH CONTROL (hide spoiler) ] In the end, I think the bad guy pulled through for Langdon by (view spoiler) [possibly preventing any unwanted pregnancies (hide spoiler) ] . IN CONCLUSION: Due to my irrefutable evidence, this book is perhaps/probably about sex and maybe/possibly the loss of Langdon's male maidenhead. Why is there not a term for a man's virginity? There needs to be a term. I find Dan Brown's writing adorable. And by \"adorable,\" I mean very naive, bland, and repetitious. He just happily types away at his little mysteries with the same character types in every book, the same things happening, the same inexplicable tendency for ladies to think that Robert Langdon is handsome. Don't worry about losing the plot from chapter to chapter or paragraph to paragraph, because Brown will recap the fuck out of it to such an extent that you'll never forget. Also, prepare to be not very surprised with frequency. The bait & switch technique isn't so special when an author uses it twenty times in the course of a novel. At least we have the travelogue through Florence and other world cities, in which Langdon stops in the middle of a high-speed chase or frantic search for clues to admire the architecture and artwork. Because that didn't get tedious or anything. I could refute some of the \"facts\" that Langdon presents about history, but that isn't as much fun as writing about ALL THE PEENS IN FLORENCE. I will close this review with an observation by Sienna, Langdon's Sexy Sue du jour : The statue before them depicted an obese, naked dwarf straddling a giant turtle. The dwarf's testicles were squashed against the turtle's shell, and the turtle's mouth was dribbling water, as if he were ill. When it comes down to it, this is my favorite passage from the book. Google the \"Fontana del Bacchino\" to see the most glorious statue of all time. >:D ...more Kinda blah after the other Langdon entries. Getting a little used to the Langdon formula. Also, in the end it was not all that great of a story (in my opinion). Honestly, hard for me to believe they got another movie in the series out of this (I hope they changed a lot of it to make it more interesting! Hard to believe I just said I hoped they changed the story when making a movie - SACRELIDGE! ) I actually want to read this book so badly, it hurts! I am so excited- when I heard that Dan Brown was releasing a new book, I screamed so loud that another girl on my floor ran into my room and thought I was getting attacked! Brown is probably my top favourite author and I have loved each book that stars Robert as the main character. I loved 'The Lost Symbol' so much!! I have really high hopes for this next one :) Update: Now that I have finished the book, I can say that it was a pure joy to read. I actually want to read this book so badly, it hurts!

Once again, Brown was able to create a mysterious and thrilling adventure. The way he combines the past with such a modern/futuristic twist that gives the story a real 'umph', flawless. This story returns back to Europe, centring around Florence and Italy. Without any spoilers, it had a lot to do with (obviously) Dante's Inferno and his Divine Comedy (a triad of epic-poems that had to do with Hell). I feel like with his fourth instalment of Langdon's Misadventures, he focuses a bit more on the history, backstory and architecture of Florence than his last book, The Lost Symbol. Perhaps because Europe has a deeper art and religious history than the United States, but it was nice to learn as well as enjoy a story. Since I am only 18, sometimes the information was a bit overwhelming but it, in my opinion, didn't take away from the story. The story itself was wonderfully constructed with an ending that gave me a lot to think about. I won't say more, least I give away something I didn't mean to, but I will say this: This book is a worthwhile read and an instant classic for those who have read Dan Brown before. My only question is this- if Brown decides to write another book, how will he top this? ...more Bullet Review: Wow, this was an awful book.

I ONLY recommend reading if A) you are doing a Bad Buddy Read, B) you don't read much and you like all your stories to end predictably, or C) your brain has an on/off switch. Otherwise, avoid the Inferno!! Full review to come...While you are waiting, check out some of these hilarious amazing reviews. Decoding Dan Brown's Inferno Our intrepid Harvard-educated, Harris tweed wearing, Mickey Mouse watch wielding symbologist, Dan Brown - I mean! - Robert Langdon wakes up in a Florence hospital and has no clue how he got there or of the last 2 days. He is aware that pretty blond-ponytail doctor, Sienna Brooks, is very pretty and tall and attractive, and that he (with Sienna in tow OF COURSE) should probably high-tail it out of the hospital when a spiky-haired, leather-wearing Consortium agent, Viantha, starts shooting at him. Thus ensues a chase across Italy and South-Western Europe as Langdon and the MYSTERIOUS, super-intelligent Sienna Brooks rush to figure out what his brain is hiding from him and plot twists pelt them helter-skelter, constantly changing the motives of the villains to make everything more MYSTERIOUS and SNEAKY. Under ordinary circumstances, I would never have picked this book up. Number 1, I've come to find that I end up hating or seriously disliking 90% of popular novels. Number 2, I'm not really a mystery/thriller fan. The cliches that a lot of fans can stomach bug the hell out of me. Number 3, I didn't like \"The Da Vinci Code\" (though the Bad Book Buddy read of it upped the enjoyment factor by about 1000%). And usually, if I don't like one book by an author (particularly if I don't like it like I didn't like TDVC), then I won't bother with any other books from him or her. It's just better that way. But Bad Book Buddy Reads chose this book to be The Summer of Dan Brown's Inferno, and I couldn't help myself. I sometimes like to read bad books to snark at them. It's the same enjoyment that causes people to watch bad action movies, Z-list movies, the Godzilla movies, etc. This will be short so let me get it out of the way quickly. Dan Brown's actual writing craft HAS improved, ever so slightly. I felt he had a better feel for grammar and pacing. In some ways, this book is more enjoyable (read: snarkable) than TDVC, in other ways it's worse. The characters are the same shade of bland that I saw in TDVC. In fact, at one point, I almost called Sienna \"Sophie\", there was so little difference in the stereotype. But first, Langdon. Our insufferable, pretentious, supposedly smart but unable to see an obvious mole in his midst Harvard professor. Oh, how many times must we hear about his Harris Tweed, the loss of his Mickey Mouse watch ( (view spoiler) [Don't worry though - he gets it back in the end! (hide spoiler) ] ), how clever he is (causing his full classrooms to burst into gales of laughter at his every joke) and how wet every woman's panties get at the sight of him. I'm not sure what is more annoying: how he'll stop in the middle of a chase scene to give the audience a 12 page lecture on some obscure piece of history or how Brown keeps telling us he's so smart while never once showing Langdon doing ANYTHING that smart. Sienna Brooks is our Love Interest this book. She fits all the politically correct slots that 90% of participants said they wanted to see in a Love Interest: + Smart, but not in the same field as our Marty Stu + Blond haired + Tall + \"Penetrating\" yet \"gentle\" brown eyes + Natural beauty, yet stunningly beautiful (because anything unnatural is yucky, but we can't have those ugly fat people in our books, what would that say about Marty Stu's sex drive?!) + A doctor + Early thirties + So smart, that she blows the IQ test out of the water with her 202 IQ (God, I am SO SICK of characters being SO SMART they have off the chart IQs. For the last time, a high IQ does NOT mean a person is the smartest person on the planet! It's a biased test that gives a VERY ROUGH ballpark about intelligence.) + Stupid enough that she has to have Marty Stu explain everything to her + This somewhat sexist line: \"Langdon saw in her eyes a frightened little girl, running scared, desperate and out of control.\" (I find it sexist because she is being compared to a \"little girl\" even though she is a grown woman.) I'm not even going to bother with the rest of the cast. They are a bunch of names and cliches drawn together with nice lines. Outlines in a child's coloring book. Not exactly plot relevant, but, hey, Brown dumps whole passages from Wikipedia so why can't I dump a cute coloring book image of an octopus in my review? BONUS POINTS: color the octopus as you read this review. What's most annoying, though, is how every single character blows the slightest event out of proportion. \"'And you're certain you saw one of these masks in your visions?' Sienna asked, her voice now tremulous.\" \"A Map of Hell was one of the most frightening visions of the afterlife ever created.\" NOTE: we are talking about this image. Not what gets me quivering in my bed. \"Sienna gasped audibly, and her eyes shot up to meet Langdon's.\" \"In a rare moment of unrestrained emotion, Agent Bruder threw back his head and let out a bellow of rage.\" But people don't really read these kinds of books for the characters. They read them for the breakneck pacing and plot. In that regard, another big failure. Number 1, Mr. Brown, changing the motivations of your characters throughout the course of your novel does NOT a plot twist make. Retconning the actions and reactions and motivations are also NOT plot twists! I can't really go into much detailing without potentially spoiling this (and even though I dislike this book, I won't spoil it for others who may read it), but come ON!! This is worse than some of the retcons in the Star Wars Universe. Number 2, if you have an action scene, you may want to avoid stopping to have one of the following: + Langdon recall, in details, a lecture he gave at Harvard. + A detailed Wikipedia entry about a building. + Repeating plot points from 3 pages in the text, as if this is a freakin' comic book or TV show. I didn't find the story breakneck; I found it neverending. It went on and on and on. And when the climax finally came in, all I could do was yawn. Try not to yawn after that! As if everything else wasn't already bad - characters, plot, pacing - the writing is positively atrocious. I wouldn't call it \"Nicholas Sparks\" bad (seriously, that guy is my benchmark of terrible writing), but with gems like these, it comes seriously close: \"She knew it was probably just the adrenaline, but she found herself strangely attracted to the American professor. In addition to his being handsome, he seemed to possess a sincerely good heart.\" Nothing like a good chase scene to get the panties all wet for an amnesiac patient! \"'As you know,' the man had begun. 'Your services were recommended to me by a mutual friend.'\" As you know, Bad Writing 101 states that to tell the audience something the characters already know, have one character say \"As you know\". It doesn't sound awkward at ALL. \"The woman was weeping now, her voice full of sadness.\" No way! A weeping woman is SAD?! I would never have thought! \"Sienna's eyes now began darting around the building with obvious concern.\" \"The look of surprise and fear on Sienna's face turned quickly to anger, and she glared back down at Farris. 'You've been lying to us, haven't you?'\" I want to note that this was said after Sienna had already noted that Farris had lied about the battery usage of his phone. Other problems with the writing that I found were: + Brown's tendency to start every chapter with a Wikipedia entry of a city or piece of architecture written in present tense and then suddenly shift to past tense for everything else. + The absolutely RIDICULOUS conclusion. Hidden for the spoilery -ness. (view spoiler) [Basically Betrand's virus sterilized 1/3 of the population. The World Health Organization's response to the genocide of the next generation? \"Well, we wouldn't have done that, but overpopulation is a problem. And who cares about all those culture who will die out because of this virus? At least now we won't be overpopulated!\" They don't bother to reverse it, they glibly accept it! (And without even considering the economic repercussions - how the hell can the smaller next generation pay for health care for the larger previous generations? Or what about what PEOPLE are affected - are they white people? Or are they minorities?) This is NOT how heroes act! MAYBE if the heroes made a good case for their acceptance, I would buy it, but it was NOT done well at all. (hide spoiler) ] In fact, the conclusion itself made me the most mad I have ever been at a Dan Brown book. More mad than at TDVC's \"Jesus was married!\" conclusion (and I consider myself a Christian, to give you a baseline). + INSANE amounts of repetition. Each time Viantha's POV cropped up, we HAD to hear how she was disavowed and had failed her mission, no matter that we had JUST read it. A part of me wonders how Brown's books ever sell. They just aren't that good. But I realize that what I want in a book isn't what a lot of other people (particularly the people who chase after the popular books) want. Many of these people adore mysteries/thrillers with a enough facts to flavor the text (just enough to make you think it could be real), characters they can easily slip themselves into or ones they can easily retrieve from their Character Archetype Banks, and a couple of plot twists to make them think they are smart but not TOO smart. Oh and something you can read on an average airplane flight. I guess if I A) didn't read much or B) could turn off my brain (something which I haven't mastered yet), then I guess I would enjoy it as much as the devoted Dan Brown fan base. But I can't, so I resort to enjoying this through the best option: C) So Bad, It's Good Bad Book Buddy Reads.

As usual, Brown throws Langdon into a seemingly no exit life threatening situation, but, little by little, he finds a way out. As the complexity of the problem was unveiled before my eyes, I couldn't wait to get to the end of the book to see the puzzle solved. The coolest feature was that the villain, this time, is committing atrocities based on Dante Alighieri masterpiece; it was amazing seeing Langdon traveling from U.S to Italy and then to other countries, explaining a bunch of interesting facts about history in the process. The way Brown uses Langdon's eidetic memory as a tool to explain every little detail about historical buildings and the pattern of the crimes is incredible. Of course it is not just about Langdon, though. There is a very complex plot going on involving secret organizations, governments and mercenaries. One of the new characters, which becomes fast friends with the professor, is a woman called Sienna. Despite her being amazing, helping Langdon and everything, there is a little thing that bothered me about this character: at times, Brown is too obvious in his attempts to make a cohesive story line. He needs someone who can get out of any situation with almost no resources, in order to help Langdon to solve the puzzle, what does he do? He creates a super genius character. Yes, Sienna is yet another character with a super IQ who can make an atomic bomb out of a box of matches. I really wish he could be a little less lazy as to create a more believable character who needs actual tools to help the protagonist. Langdon being a genius is already enough for me. Regardless, the final parts when they finally understand the way the villain plans on potentially destroying humanity is super exhilarating. Brown does a really good job of overlapping Dante's ancient poem with the events of the story. About the final message of the book, I feel sorry (I guess?) to say that I can relate to Zobrist's ideal. Earth's overpopulation is an actual issue which, unfortunately, our governments are not taking seriously enough. Of course I don't agree with the radical inhumane actions taken by Zobrist, but I can't deny that some kind of population growth control is dearly needed. All in all, I loved the way the story was told. Brown again got me thinking about deep global questions and possible answers to them, dark as they might be. It was also a totally fun way of learning a little bit more about history without having to spend time opening unending Wikipedia tabs. Interesting quotes that I didn't include in the review: The decisions of our past are the architects of our present. The human mind has a primitive ego defense mechanism that negates all realities that produce too much stress for the brain to handle. It\u2019s called Denial. ...more 2.75 ok I think I loved angels & demons and the davinci code more than inferno wasn't enjoyable enough for me like always expecting from dan brown books Compared wid his previous offerings, definitely lacklustre (better than the lost symbol..though that doesnt amount to much) The author i felt wasnt able to resist dumping all his research into the book without any form of culling.

All the random interesting nuggets and facts which made his previous books bestsellers were fascinating because they were very much a part of the ongoing story and seemed like a plausible thought-train in Robert langdon's mind. Inferno however doles out information by the dozen, which at times seems too far off the intellectual thought process. And the majority of it feels like a dragging commentary on architecture which for me was tedious to read through. Lots of times, Langdon seemed far removed from the looming crisis and a sense of urgency even though put in words here and there, was not appreciable for the reader. The book does get better towards the end and the plot line was good enough. I did guess a few of those twists. If you are a fan, you will like it...and still feel its not upto expectations. Pros: Plot theme Some nice twists and turns Cons: Missing those fun/controversial facts which made the reader go \"ooo..\" or \" wow..wtf\" No sense of submersive involvement for the reader till maybe..the latter third of the book. ...more The only reason I read this book is because of the subject matter.

Oh, and then parade his \"knowledge of Dante\" in the form of \"flashbacks\" to his famous lecture and by the uncanny ability to quote the most iconic and well-recognized quotations from The Inferno. The rest of the book was, sadly, formulaic with very little sense of urgency. It was also bland. I didn't even feel like it was Florence at all. ...more 3.5 I\u2019ve compiled a list for my review.
