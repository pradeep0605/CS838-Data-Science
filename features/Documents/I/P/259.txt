An interesting and unpredictable plot? Not really. Clich\u00e9? Very. Romance and sex? At times the romance was almost sappy and the sex was good but I actually had expected it to be hotter (it's quality people, not quantity!). But despite all of the above: I understand the attraction of the books! I liked this book. I might even be on the verge of loving this book. And I really liked Wrath. And I liked the rest of the boys. And I'm fascinated by Zsadist. And I want to read his book (#3). Fast. So I'm buying book #2 (about Rhage) while I'm at it. And I heard book #4 is about Butch. And I want to read that too. Did I get addicted? Maybe. But I think I might know why. It's because the Brothers are a girl\u2019s fantasy come true. Cause doesn't every girl grow up fantasizing about a guy who is tough and cool but has a soft spot for you? Everybody's scared of him, except for you. Because he loves you. A lot. And no one else. Snapping somebody's neck while he's buying you flowers. *sigh* Meet the Black Dagger Brotherhood. ...more You have got to be kidding me.

And as if that isn't hilarious enough, Ward just doesn't get enough of superlatives to describe how extremely dangerous her vampires - a bunch of interchangeable Conans the Barbarian - actually are. Allow me to quote: \"Rhage was a towering male, big, powerful, stronger than all the other warriors. He was also a sex legend in the vampire world. Hollywood beautiful with the drive to rival a barnful of stallions. Females,<---M> vampire and human alike</---M>, would trample their own young to get at him. But when Rhage's beast came out everyone looked for shelter and took up praying.\" You know, I was har-har-harring in both amusement and disbelief when I read that..well..nonsense. BUT when you consider that Rhage is just one of the 6 brothers and there are actually 5 more Chippendales in line, waiting to be introduced in painful flowery language as well, let's just say I wasn't laughing anymore. Realization hit me; I actually paid 11 euro's for this trash, which was exactly what I paid for Let the Right One in as well. And there you have it; there is no justice in this world. The problem with <+++>Dark Lover</+++> is that you might presume this is an entirely different book. You may get lured in by this exciting sounding black dagger brotherhood of vampire warriors, erotically charged dark fantasy stuff and the fact that <+++>Dark Lover</+++> is a big fat Goodreads hype. However, what you see is not what you get; which is a silly written fluffy romance novel with large quantities of your typical fluffy romance novel sex (think; celibate, big, bad and totally handsome vampire king falls head over heels in love with this super-gorgeous 25 year old chick and makes her orgasm a dozen of times for the FIRST TIME in her life. Again, YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!). I can imagine that Dark Lover can be fabulous escape-the-daily-grind material. So why don't you test yourself by reading the next part. If Wrath totally turns you on, I suggest you get your paws on this book asap! ^^ \"Wrath was 6 feet, 9 inches of pure terror dressed in leather. His hair was long and black, falling straight from a widow's peak. Wraparound sunglasses hid eyes that no one had ever seen revealed. Shoulders were twice the size of most males. With a face that was both aristocratic and brutal, he looked like the king he was by birthright and the soldier he'd become by destiny.

It makes it seem more like it's fate when she meets the male lead and less like you\u2019re trying to shove antiquated bel How to Write a Paranormal Romance Step One : Create a Sue This is a female lead that can either be a Mary Sue, a Jerk Sue or a Sympathetic Sue. Just an FYI, most writers go with a Mary, as the ideal of women remaining virgins until they find \u201cThe One\u201d is allegedly still vastly appealing to the masses. I suggest creating a heroine that\u2019s never even been attracted to a man before. It makes it seem more like it's fate when she meets the male lead and less like you\u2019re trying to shove antiquated beliefs down your reader\u2019s throats. Step Two : Create a Ragebeast Your male lead should be over six feet tall, have dark hair, tattoos and so much testosterone-inflated muscle that he has to walk through doors sideways. The less he talks, the better. In every scene that you\u2019re tempted to give him dialogue, instead make him brood over something. You\u2019re going for caveman here, modern women don\u2019t want a partner that can communicate feelings or sympathize with emotions. We just want someone who can bench press twice our body weight. If you really want to make us swoon, make him a prince too, or an uber-alpha, or a frigging king . That will fulfill the Princess Fantasy that half of us are infected with thanks to those assholes over at Disney. Step Three : Make these two the exception to each other\u2019s rules. Emotionally cripple the male. He shouldn\u2019t believe in love. Not until he sees your Mary Sue. When he finally lays eyes on her however, you can take that caveman frown and turn it upside down. I suggest blaring Foreigner\u2019s I Wanna Know What Love Is on repeat while writing this scene as it will really help you capture the emotion your readers should be feeling at this point. And remember that lack of attraction to the opposite sex you\u2019ve afflicted Mary with? Well, when she lays eyes on your beast of a male lead her va-jay-jay should turn into the river Nile. Step Four : The shmushing together of squishy bits Sex. Add it. Lots of it. On a bed, in the bathroom of a club, a stairwell, an alleyway, you get the drift. Just know that the more you mix it up, the better. Repetition is the bane of the sex scene\u2019s existence. Also, we\u2019d really appreciate it if you could avoid using these phrases: 1. Slippery juices \u2022 This brings up safety concerns 2. Clenching womb \u2022 She\u2019s having sex, not a baby 3. Pulsating sausage \u2022 I like breakfast cooked, thanks 4. Squelch \u2022 I shouldn\u2019t have to explain this one Step Five : Don\u2019t forget the mystery! As tempting as it may seem, you can\u2019t just fill up three hundred pages with nothing but relationship angst because if you do I WILL people may hate you. You\u2019ll want to add in an actual plot line to avoid that. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not as hard as it sounds. Make up a creepy crawly bad guy, have him kill some innocent people and maybe torture a kid or rape someone and your readers will immediately hate him and get behind your MCs and their fight for \u2018good\u2019. You don\u2019t even have to get that heavy with it. In fact, you can probably squeeze it in between your gymnastic-inspired sex scenes. Step Six : Climax, the literary kind Have the bad guy kidnap the heroine. Feel free to let him slap her around a little and hint at the terrible things he\u2019s going to do to her but don\u2019t get too carried away here as you may offend those with delicate sensitivities. Just before the villain can carry out these dastardly plans, have the hero save your Mary Sue. What? Well yes that\u2019s a little damsel-in-distress-ish but trust me on this, everyone else is doing it too and no one\u2019s complaining about it yet. You want readers or not, lady? Step Seven : HEAs; they\u2019re not just for fairy tales and contemporary romances End your book on a high note. Your readers don\u2019t want cliffhangers or dead male leads. They want to see a white dress or a bad guy with coins on his eyes because your ragebeast eviscerated him before rescuing the heroine and taking her back to his \u2018lair\u2019 to bang the hell out of her regardless of her emotional, mental or physical bruises. One plus of going light on the plotline (like I suggested) is that it makes it easy to wrap things up in a nice little bow. You\u2019re welcome. ***Okay so this all sounds rather critical, and it is. I'm sure you're wondering \"So why the four stars?\". Well, in my opinion, this author takes all the themes I've mentioned and does them well which makes for one entertaining and sexy read.*** ...more \"Wrath was six feet, six inches of pure terror dressed in leather.

We get the world building, the awesome characters, the terrible bad guys, and an amazing main couple! Just! Perfect! The story The Black Dagger Brotherhood is the only force between vampires and the evil lessers. They are here to protect the vampire race, and lead them. Wrath is the only pure vampire left, he is their King, although he doesn't want to assume the role. After one of his closest friends gets killed by the evil enemy, Wrath decides to honor his friend's request, and protect his daughter, Beth. Beth doesn't know who her parents are, or that she is part vampire, but after a scary huge guy enters her apartment, her life completely changes. She is drawn to him sexually (how could she not be), and doesn't know what to believe when one of her cop friends accuses him of being a murderer. Wrath wants Beth, even though he doesn't want to, but he needs to protect her, and when her change hits, she will need his blood to up her chances of survival. Will he be able to stay away from her? Will he be able to watch her mated with someone else without ripping his throat out? We'll see :DDD \"He had her on the bed and under him in a flash of movement, and he pushed up her skirt and tore off her panties with vicious impatience. He didn't treat her blouse or bra any better. There would be time to savor later. Now was all about raw sex.\" The world building - Excellent! There is a huge dictionary with everything explained in detail, so it REALLY helps, even though all of it is explained in the book as well, but my suggestion is to read it BEFORE you get to the book, you will understand everything a lot better :) How the vampire thing works - Well this will be explained in the book gradually, but the most important thing you need to know is that they DON'T DRINK FROM HUMANS. They can eat food just like normal people, but need blood to survive and stay strong, and that blood has to be from a vampire. They're BIG and BADASS, hmmm maybe HUGE and KICKASS would do better ahahhahahah, anyway, they don't do sunlight, and well, all the other tidbits you can find out for yourself :)))))) The writing - This is VERY easy to read :) Well, at least for me :) I love the way they talk, and swear, and act. We get both MC POVs, even some from the supporting characters. Love that :DDD The characters - We are introduced to a LOT of them in this first book. It's hard to keep up in the beginning, but with them having such unusual names, you'll have no problem remembering who's who :) The BDB guys are uber-interesting, and we meet some characters from the vampire nobility, as well as some humans that will appear later :)) The bad guys, <---C>Mr. X</---C>YOPMGblablablablabla are pretty irritating :DDD but OK they're the bad guys, I guess it shouldn't be a shock ahahahha :D The sex - It's pretty hot, with lots of sex scenes, even though i admit it gets hotter in the next books :D Still, Wrath has that something, mmm mmm mmm <3 \"God, everything about him radiated sex, from the strength in his body to the way he moved to the smell of his skin. He was like no man she'd ever come across before. And her body knew it just as clearly as her mind did.\" Nearing her 25th birthday, Beth has no idea that she's about to go through the change and become a vampire. The first encounter with Wrath was full of terror, but when she saw him again *fans self* They both know there is an attraction between them, only Beth doesn't try to fight it like Wrath does. She realises how extraordinary he is, and falls in love with the fierce vampire King :)))) As a human, Beth is pretty weak physically, and has no sex urges, until she sees Wrath :D Oh man and what a way to discover them ahahahhahahah Those two can't get enough of each other, even though it isn't rational, but when it comes to mates and their connection... Yep :D So, even though she is weak physically, as a characters she is fantastic, strong, willing to fight for Wrath and standing by him when he needed it. Just loved her :) And when she comforted Rhage, that was one of my favorite scenes in the book :) I forgot how great a relationship Wrath and Beth had, because they are the first couple, but truly, I love them and their story <3 \"Your language is beautiful,\" she said. \"There are no words worthy of you.\" He is the leader of the Black Dagger Brotherhood and the vampire king. His blood is the strongest, and that's why he was needed to help Beth through her transition. The attraction was a surprise, but one Wrath couldn't avoid. He wants Beth like no other before, and even though he fights it all the way, he knows he wants to mark her and make her his leelan. He is King, but doesn't feel worthy of the title. He has a sad history, and the way his parents died... But soon he will have to make a choice, because the Brotherhood will not survive without strong leadership, and the lessers are growing more and more powerful by the day. I just have to say, Wrath is HUGE and badass and pretty cold at the beginning, but we get to see him \"melt\" and show more and more of his emotions, and that ending with Beth, OMG! I totally forgot about it and it was so so great to see <3 He just loves her so much and I just love him for it even more!!!!! He was a jerk a few times ahahhah but the poor guy's people skills are like ZERO ahahhahhah :DD Some of my fav scenes were with Wrath and Fritz :DD so funny, and of course with Beth, the transition, the ending *sigh* So perfect for each other <3 Here are some of my favorite quotes from the other characters: \"You're pathetic.'\" Tohr hissed. \"And you've been dead for hundreds of years. You're just too mean to find a grave and lie down.\" \"Christ, I know I'm ugly,\" he snapped. \"But don't fear me. I'm not a total savage.\" \"I'm happy to take you on, asshole,\" Butch said. \"I'll probably end up losing, but I fight dirty, so I'll make you hurt while you kill me.\" \"Worship me, gentlemen.\" V lit a hand-rolled. Flipped the gold lighter shut. \"And I might let you play with the buttons.\" \"Yeah.\" Rhage sighed. \"All I want is one good female. But I guess I'll settle for quantity until I find her. Life just sucks, doesn't it?\" Best series ever. True? ...more I originally wrote this review in a more innocent time.

I complained about the content and nature of Wrath and Beth's relationship but let it slide because, hey it was just some light-hearted fun. A couple of years ago I was at my mother's house when a large, terrifying spider began its battle charge toward me with murderous intent gleaming in its eyes (witness accounts may vary...) In case you are unaware, I have a deep and unabidding terror of anything with more than six legs. The spider racing toward me looked something like this: Nobody else at the scene of the event picks up details like I do... Because she loves me (presumably) and to put a stop to my earsplitting girlie shrieks of \"Kill it! Kill IIIIIIIIITTT!\" (less presumably) my mother whacked it triumphantly with a shoe. It is at this point that hundreds of small, though equally malevolent spider spawn emerged from the crushed remains of their mother, all equally intent on destroying me one little piece at a time. [image error] Each one was chanting this in their tiny babyspider voices as they rushed toward me with evil in their heart and malice in their eyes... I count this as the most traumatic moment of my life. I find it extremely ironic that it was a vacuum cleaner, the bane of my life, that rescued me that night while I jumped on the couch in a fit of apoplectic terror. And it is with equal terror that I look upon the undead spawn that has filled the market since Dark Lover first emerged into the reading sphere. ...more UPDATE : Thanks for all friends and people who have like this review and commenting.

I loved this book! Wrath and Beth\u2019s romantic story is intense and kept me on the edge of my seat along with those hot, sexy love scenes.

There was something she couldn't decipher in his tone. An achy pitch. He dug his hand into his thick, dark hair. \"And I'm going to shut up now. before I make you feel even more uncomfortable.\" His eyes stayed on her face. They were really nice eyes, she thought. So warm. And they held a lonely yearning as he looked at her. As if he couldn't have something he wanted. She knew all about that. The human laughed, a burst of sound that came from deep inside his chest. \"And how 'bout I try not to stare? That'd be good.\" He crammed his hands in the pockets of his pants and focused on the door. \"Look at me. Not staring. Not staring at all. Hey, this is a nice rug.

Never mind. \u2461 Suspend Disbelief to the Power of 100, example #1 : What girl in her right mind would have unprotected sex with a super hot thug-looking, deliciously mysterious unknown bastard who breaks into her apartment in the middle of the night?! Please Sarah, do try and refrain from raising your hand here, some of your dear friends wouldn't understand. \u2462 Suspend Disbelief to the Power of 100, example #2 : Wrath : \"Nice to meet you Beth, you are half-human half-vampire. Fangs growing in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, NOW!\" Beth : \"oh okay. No biggie. Can we have sex first?\" Me : \"Hey Beth, what did you do today?\" Beth : \"Oh, you know, same old, same old: went to work, stopped to get Chinese food on the way home, had my first orgasms ever with a total stranger met a delightful gentleman, grew some fangs.\" Me : \"damn Beth, don't you ever get bored?! No offense girl, but you really need to get a life.\" \u2463 INSTA-FUCKING-LOVE . Need I say more? Didn't think so. Oh wait. Maybe I do. Need to say more, I mean. Because there's insta-love and there's insta-get-married. Wow. These people don't fool around, do they? Well they do but \u2013hey! Will you take your mind off the gutter for just 5 seconds?! Damn.

Too late, I think I just died. I'm seeing fluffy bunnies and pastel-colored rainbows everywhere. This is the END. \u2465 Wrath is nothing but a sick love puppy in a lethal bastard's clothing . A decaf asshole, if you will. A big, cosy teddy bear in leather pants. With throwing stars. And daggers (obviously). And guns. And stuff. But still a little too diet for my taste . Now MY Z is something else altogether. Please don't get excited girls, I already did the Bam! Poof! Gone! on him and he's safely stashed away in my high security harem. So don't waste time getting all hormonal on me. His ass is MINE. I repeat. His ass is MINE . Yes, I'm talking to Z, not to you, silly girls *eyeroll* [PS: Ange seems to think Vishous is hers. Hahaha. She's so funny. Slightly delusional, but very funny.] \u2466 HEA. HEA? HEA?????? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!! Go away, go away! Please tell me HEA means Horribly Ever After!!!! Please!!!

I realize that Wrath is a vampire, but I can\u2019t suspend my belief enough to buy into anyone, supernatural or no, being able to smell what someone looks like. If you are able to smell someone so strongly that images form in your mind, that person is made of stink and you should run, quickly, in the opposite direction. Also, someone named Wrath has no business cuddling with anyone except the devil. Seriously, am I supposed to believe that someone named after one of the seven deadly sins is capable of falling in love with someone so insipid? And can someone explain the mythology to me? Actually please don\u2019t, but seriously, if vampires don\u2019t need to drink human blood to survive, why should they have to hide? And why would they drink human blood?

From the description, it sounded more like dark fantasy, but in practice, it's more like a romance novel of the cheesiest variety, only replace the generic pirate/naughty lord/auto mechanic human hunk with a vampire hunk.

They were nigh on obsessed with this vampire hunting series, having bought all the books and swapping them between each other.

Some months later, I asked one of these friends about the title of the books she loved, and she said they were part of a se I remember a few years ago, being huddled around a table in the canteen, and talking about books with some of my friends. They were nigh on obsessed with this vampire hunting series, having bought all the books and swapping them between each other. I never got to borrow any copies (but then again I was kind of burnt out on vampires anyway), but the name did stick in my mind. Some months later, I asked one of these friends about the title of the books she loved, and she said they were part of a series called the Black Dagger Brotherhood. The title sounds kind of cool, doesn't it? Eventually I downloaded the e-book, and started reading it. I was howling four percent in. Reading this book was like watching a really bad crime thriller that wallows in its own grittiness and has stereotypical characters, like the grumpy detective, the shallow heroine who can't help but get herself in trouble, the devoted vampire bride whose husband just won't reciprocate her affections, and various other oddball vampires who just so happen to be purebred or highly-trained and thus, are more awesome than civilian vampires. Oh, the characters\u2026 Sigh\u2026 Oy vey, in fact. The aforementioned shallow heroine is named Beth. She works for a newspaper, and is described as being stunningly gorgeous. No, seriously, I mean it. <---A>J.R. Ward</---A> goes at length to make sure you know this. Beth has long black hair and perfect facial shape and lips made for kissing a man (seriously, J.R. Ward wrote this!) and a perfect figure: a short waist, long legs, and ample breasts. She finishes work at the beginning of the novel, and is almost raped by this utter berk. However, she's saved and she gets back to the apartment, and seems to freaking forget about almost being raped. She jitters for a moment or two, then has a shower, eats a ready meal, and plays with her cat. Yeah. In the morning, this guy called Butch (who she lovingly nicknames Detective Hard-Ass) rather objectionably demands to know how she got some of her superficial injuries from being assaulted. Beth eventually tells him, which leads us on to my other point about bad characters in this book. Being the daughter of a retired police officer, I can tell you that in most developed nations, the police generally don't beat the living tar out of suspects before making an arrest, which is exactly what Butch does to the guy who nearly raped Beth, even though the only evidence he has is a description of his appearance. Do you know why that is? Partly human rights, partly not living in a part of the world where police brutality doesn't really exist, and partly compensation culture! Yes, call it political correctness if you will, but I highly doubt Butch's policing skills. Beth even says early on in the novel that Butch's interrogation methods leave people in hospital. In hospital. Well, kudos to you, J.R. Ward, for perpetuating the stereotype that most cops are violent idiots who were probably bullied at school and now take out all their rage on criminals, because a badge and ID card now legally allows them to. And while this Billy Riddle kid who almost raped Beth confesses his crime the moment this hilariously over-the-top depiction of a hard-nosed police officer threatens to whack him in the privates so hard that he'll be 'pissing sitting down for a week', what would have happened if it was a case of mistaken identity? Butch would have egg on his face in the form of having his badge and gun taken away, and he'd probably be forced to pay out massively in compensation. When Butch finds Billy in the morgue later that afternoon, he threatens him and really physically abuses him. Grabbing him by the lapels, slamming him against the wall, slapping him around the head, and breaking his nose. Now, I'm not saying that Billy doesn't deserve this kind of punishment for his horrible crime, I'm just shocked that anyone would think any police investigation revolves around mercilessly beating up a suspect and apparently putting some of them in hospital! You know that tense interrogation scene in The Dark Knight where Batman interviews The Joker and slams his head into the table and throws him around the room and shakes him and slams him against the wall? That's a cool scene, but it's complete and utter fantasy! Butch took that type of good cop bad cop routine and amplified it, and it's fucking ridiculous. Did I mention all that happened barely 10% into the book? Boy, we are in for a ride. Now, let's look away from our human characters for a moment, and onto the vampires. First things first. The vampires all have absolutely ridiculous names. I mean it. Wrath is one of our main characters, and besides being described as what appears in my mind as the horrifying cross between Vegeta from Dragon Ball Z and Neo from The Matrix , he's at least\u2026 okay as a character. He's boring, but hey, we've got ridiculous names to talk about! 1. Tohrment 2. Rhage 3. Phury 4. Zsadist 5. Vishous These all sound like names a really crappy DJ or band or artist would give themselves. (Speaking of that, there's mention of a band called 'Tomato Eater'. *facepalm*) Also, let's look at Zsadist's background, shall we? So, he's a tortured soul who enjoys pain. He's got tattoos and piercings all over the place, and he's heavily scarred because of his addiction to pain. So surely his name should be Mhasokhist? Of course, Beth isn't just there to look pretty. No, she has connections to the vampires, in that her father (Darius) has just been killed off via a car bomb, and lo and behold, he's a vampire! Her body is transitioning now she's come of age, I guess, and so the Black Dagger Brotherhood puts her under their protection. She begins noticing something's off, and then\u2026 there was the mother of all awful vampire sex scenes. I mean it. I'm no prude, but the writing was just hysterically awful, not erotic in the least. J.R. Ward seems obsessed with the shape of her characters' faces, with undulation and curvaceousness. Now, in this sex scene, Beth is rocked by a wave of lust when Wrath, a creepy looking guy dressed all in black leather, stalks into her apartment. Normal people would tell him to get out, call the cops, you know, be a bit freaked out. Not Beth! No, she quite happily lets the weirdo chomp on his cigarillo (which is not a sexy image in the least \u2013 it makes me think of some corrupt old oil baron), then close the distance between them, and yes, it all ends up in the bedroom. And if you thought the sex scenes in the Sookie Stackhouse books were bad... then look away now. Beth's breasts descriptively strain against her top, Wrath's John Thomas throbs like it has its own heartbeat, Beth's body undulates in a sexy wave... urgh, dear gods. If there was ever a time I wanted brain bleach, it was now. I mean, for gods' sake, when Beth decides halfway through foreplay that she doesn't really want to have sex after almost being raped the night before, like Khal Drogo from A Game of Thrones , he grumpily says 'no' to her refusal and continues anyway because he lusts after her so much. And Beth just lets him! OH-MY-GOD. -_- Also, the terminology and the metaphors and similes used in this book are utterly bizarre! Barely 20% into the book, we have a prostitute 'shaking her ass like it was a can of paint' . Dead sexy. Then there's a description of Wrath's abdominal muscles looking like someone had inserted paint-rollers underneath his skin. Because home improvement is, need I remind you, dead sexy. Another bizarre choice was the security at a mechanic's workshop being 'tighter than a tick'. Uh... tighter than a tick? I understand that ticks do clamp down something awful on skin (resulting in Mr. Tweezers meeting Mr. Tick), but that is a godawful comparison. The terminology is also a really big problem in this book. The reader occasionally gets vampire-specific lingo, such as shellan and doggan. If you're curious as to what they mean, well, basically a shellan is the permanent partner of a vampire, and bonded to them for eternity. A doggan is a servant of a higher-ranking vampire. And since the vampires in this book all seem to be rich, princely bad boys, they happily ignore their wives and make sure Fritz the butler knows his place every once in a while. However, the most major problem that The Black Dagger Brotherhood has in this regard is that those terms are not defined in the slightest. I had to go 'well I guess since shellans are kind of like wives then...' only much later in the novel do we get any kind of explanation about this vampire-specific language. Admittedly, TBDB has an interesting take on the vampire mythos. Rather than the Black Dagger Brotherhood feeding from humans to sate their appetites, they actually feed off each other. Human blood is their equivalent of junk food, in fact. It fills you up, but not for long. Being exposed to sunlight results in second and third degree burns before turning into ashes, and the vampires even have their own religion, where the Scribe Virgin is the embodiment of good, and the Omega is the embodiment of evil who creates soulless 'Lessers'. Interesting, but there are still some incredibly flawed things about this book. I also remember sitting back whilst reading this book and realising just how much of a sausage fest it was. I mean it. There are more than 10 men featured as protagonists, antagonists, or deuteragonists, and barely 5 female characters. Now, this isn't too much of a problem. I don't demand that the books I read have an equal balance of the sexes, it's just that the female characters are awfully written here, like some of them were just an afterthought. Beth is attractive and has no common sense whatsoever. I don't care that she and Wrath are fated to be together, but you do not let some creep come into your apartment and have his way with you because you're rocked by feelings of lust. The other female characters are underdeveloped wives, or prostitutes who wind up murdered. There's a smidgen of back-story to one of them, whose name is Mary, but otherwise, they're just cheap trollops who are there to dress provocatively and get killed for it. I barely got to know Wellsie or Marissa, two of the 'wives' of our main vampire characters, because there's little to no background information about them. Wellsie is pregnant and deeply in love with her mate. That's it. Marissa is mated to Wrath but breaks up with him when he gets serious with Beth and then her brother Havers is all like: \u201cHey, you ruined everything\u201d and so she's upset and finds solace in Detective Hard-Ass, which comes completely out of nowhere, if only to break some vampire taboo. The pacing in this novel is also a major problem. Things seem to happen much too fast. Stuff like character relations, discovering vital plot information, getting over the shock of something... they all happen much too fast. And then we get distracted away from the main plot to focus on inane shit like Beth and Wrath having sex, Marissa and Butch having sex, and over the course of twenty or so bloody pages near the end, we have Wrath and Beth getting married. You know. Let's forget about this serial killer and his lackey, Billy Riddle. Let's get married in an impromptu ceremony, even though we didn't know each other from Adam two weeks ago! The ending is also as clumsy as Bambi trying to walk across that frozen pond. Far too much happens in the course of those pages, and there are several fake-outs which really got on my nerves. One of the Brotherhood is supposed to have betrayed them all, then oh no he didn't actually. One of the villains is killed, but the other one escapes after shooting one of our heroes and setting his dogs (pit-bull terriers, since of course that ugly stereotype will never go away) on another. Then there's a long and convoluted scene in the hospital, and a rather desperate grab for a sequel in the form of a certain character being resurrected from the dead. Eurgh. So, awful pacing plus badly-written sex plus terribly-written female characters in the middle of a complete sausage fest of vampires and humans who are ridiculous archetypes served to make this book a really bad experience for me. I'm told that this is just the first book in a fairly good series, and the fans even agree that this book is hardly liquid gold, but I do not care enough to get the sequels, based on this. I may give TV shows a three episode litmus test before dropping them (in case they do turn out to be amazing), but I am much less forgiving with book series. Sorry. 1/5.

Note #1: I think it\u2019ll be a little hard for me to separate the feelings and thoughts about this book by itself and not to think about what will happens as the story goes so I\u2019m sorry if I spoil something for any of you or have mixed feelings about something that\u2019s quite clear in this book. I\u2019ll try my best. Well, it\u2019s been a couple of years since I read this book. I think that the first time I read it was back in 2006 and then again in early 2012. It feels so good to be back on the BDB train. Since The Shadows came a few months ago, I\u2019ve been having this craving for the Brothers and now here I am, back on board and ready to the next step. Let\u2019s get this party started! (: Thank you, Internet, for letting me find these books. So, this is the first book in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series and it\u2019s mostly about Wrath and Beth and how they fight to be together. And shit is hard, you know, but it\u2019s harder for them because, well, he\u2019s a legendary vampire, The King , and full-time warrior and she\u2019s a half-vampire reporter who doesn\u2019t know about her let\u2019s-keep-the-sun-out-of-this side until certain events lead for Wrath to seek for her and she\u2019s thrown into this dark world, full of danger, passion and death. I really like Wrath and Beth together. I think they work so great and their dynamic is just fantastic. When it comes to those two? It\u2019s like everything fits. Wrath\u2019s insecurities and fears are welcomed and almost extinguished by Beth\u2019s love and fierceness. In reality, a love like theirs it\u2019s impossible very hard to find and maybe that\u2019s why I like them so much. I won\u2019t say that Beth is perfect but she\u2019s damn very close to it and that\u2019s what makes her so good to be in charge, to help rebuild this family and the entire race. Wrath makes her adventurous and happy and she makes him feel loved and happy. OTP. Wrath is a very hard man to describe, to be honest. He\u2019s a complex character, he sets the tone and tell you what to do. He\u2019s a warrior, a protector, a king, a leader\u2026 He\u2019s spent centuries fighting along with his Brother against the Lessening Society , the undead who are a huge threat for their race and the human world. They\u2019re soulless and they only exist for one single purpose: killing vampires. Wrath is the heir to the throne, a title he didn\u2019t want nor planned to accept. The only thing he wanted to do was to fight and go down fighting to protect his kind. Guys, the man is wild in the sheets material. \"Wrath was six feet, six inches of pure terror dressed in leather. His hair was long and black, falling straight from a widow's peak. Wraparound sunglasses hid eyes that no one had ever seen revealed. Shoulders were twice the size of most males'. With a face that was both aristocratic and brutal, he looked like the king he was by birthright and the solider he'd become by destiny.\" I really liked those flashbacks where we were shown how Wrath was before his transition. I always thought he was raised back in the Old Country? And trust me, I could read a whole book about the Brothers\u2019 lives before their transitions. The thing is: Wrath\u2019s story is told exactly how it was supposed to be and I think his share of fears and \u201cweaknesses\u201d are just the right ones for him. He\u2019s haunted by the shame he\u2019s felt all these years for being incapable of protecting his parents when he was young and the fear of ascending to the throne and bring his people to ruin, well, they\u2019re only enhanced by the fact that he\u2019s blind. I this he comes a long way and the character development is really subtle. There are some big changes, yes, but as for the rest? You can only see how everyone opens up through the story. That\u2019s how I like it. Little things that mean the world. Beth, on the other hand, is a more relatable character. She was hard to read, to be honest. Why? Well, she\u2019s a really normal woman who feels the way we\u2019d feel if we were in her place. And, come on, we\u2019ve all felt like a fish out of water and that\u2019s exactly who Beth Randall is. She works hard, she receives so little or nothing in return. She was in the system for most part of her life, living from one family to another, never finding a place she could really call her own. She has friends but no one really close to her, she feels like she should be doing something else but she doesn\u2019t know what exactly, she doesn\u2019t feel the urge to establish a relationship with anyone and she\u2019s a loner but she\u2019s an honest woman, she\u2019s smart, dedicated, lovable and full of love and compassion to give. She\u2019s so levelheaded and I really liked her. So, what was her deal, right? What was she looking for? She was looking for a home. For people she could take care of. For people to love and for that feeling of security, that feeling of finally belong. At the end of the day, that was the whole purpose of the book. To find a new place to start and rebuild. She was damn fierce. And then he saw Beth. She was wearing a long T-shirt that was covered with blood and dirt, her eyes gone mad as she knelt by Wrath\u2019s body with one wrist to his lips. When she noticed them, she hissed and brought up her knife, prepared to fight. That\u2019s why Butch is brought to the picture, that\u2019s why Marissa is where she is and that\u2019s why everything falls into place. As for the rest of the characters, I enjoyed reading about them. I loved their dynamic, their, well, brotherhood. Every single one of them were interesting. I know, yeah? We have Rhage, the beautiful one, the cursed one, and the one you just don\u2019t know how to feel about. Do you like him? Do you hate him? Do you want to read more about him? Why the fuck does he have a living beast on his back? Next we have Zsadist, the soulless one with the voice of an angel. How did he get those scars? Why is he so hateful? Why is he so volatile? (view spoiler) [THIS IS MY HELLREN , ladies and gentlemen, this is the man I cried for the very first time in these books and I\u2019m so very proud of him. (hide spoiler) ] Then we have Butch, the cop. How is he going to live with them? Are they going to kill him in the end? Is he going to end up with Marissa? But wait, he\u2019s going to eventually die, yeah? Vishous, the eerie one. What is his deal? Why does he have visions? What the fuck does he have in his hand? Phury, the celibate twin. He shot his own foot to save Zsadist, how and why? Why Zsadist was the only one taken as blood slave? What happened with him? Why is he celibate? Tohr, the one you can count on. How are you dealing with all of this? Are you really this stable man? How did all of you meet? I think this is a very strong start for a series and, maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a girl, but I\u2019ve always enjoyed a man\u2019s POV a bit more than a woman\u2019s. Sue me but I liked fast paced books with raw characters, sexy times, funny times and lots of actions. I like me some bloody books and that\u2019s what Ward gives me. How could I complain? I could not. I\u2019ve always said Ward\u2019s female characters are weaker than her male characters and it makes sense because the story is mostly about them and if you continue reading these books and get to the Insider\u2019s Guide, you will see what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m not saying that she\u2019s degrading women just that her male characters shine way more. What I\u2019m intrigued about is the whole Virgin/Omega situation. I wouldn\u2019t mind reading a book about them and how everything started and what are exactly the extension of their powers. Is this a sort of yin and yang thing? Is there a balance? Are they the children of God and the Devil? I appreciate how Ward gets into everyone\u2019s minds and where people would find annoying the several POVs, I\u2019d find them perfect. This is a very complex world the one she\u2019s built and it helps us to get into it having different POVs. Yes, it can be distracting but if you\u2019re into the story, you\u2019re okay with it. The sex scenes are the right amount for the book and they\u2019re not uncomfortable to read and, even when I\u2019ll define Wrath and Beth as a rushed couple at some points, they have a lot of sex chemistry. Here you will have your tortured heroes, your typical and not so typical women, enemies and lots of actions. Ward\u2019s writing style is, most of the time, fast and to-the-point but also can be really beautiful and poetic. It all depends on the POV, really. You\u2019re going to hate some characters and then love them and hate them again and so on. You will read people whose situations are hard not to sympathize with and maybe you won\u2019t be okay with that, maybe you will. The point is, you either love it or hate it but I\u2019m welcoming you, if you wanna take the ride. Anyhow, hands down, this is a book I\u2019d recommend to anyone who likes paranormal romance. Note #2: And now comes the part where I go back to be really fucking happy about how everything works out (kinda) as the books go. Bear with me and, if you haven\u2019t read the rest of the books, please do not read this part. I\u2019ll mark as spoiler the whole section because that\u2019s exactly what it is. (view spoiler) [ How can Ward think she can fool us by not saying with her words that John is Darius reincarnated? Like, seriously, the last part was pretty obvious to me and to everyone else. People go and say but she hasn\u2019t said that exactly\u2026 Well, do you see any other person who could be Darius? Plus, the Virgin said she would take a token of faculty. Uhm, that\u2019s his voice. It\u2019s pretty clear, my friends. Guys, I still need a book about the Old Country. When will I get one? I\u2019m so happy and scared that Ward\u2019s writing/continuing the stories already set but I really need that book. And another Insider\u2019s Guide *sigh* a girl can only hope, true?

Oh did anyone else skip the parts of Mr. X I just can't stand them... No screw it I'm done. Book one of the Black Dagger Brotherhood series... The Black Dagger Brotherhood is a group of vampires here to protect the vampire race. Wrath is the leader of this group- their king, by blood. Wrath was 6 feet, 9 inches of pure terror dressed in leather. Wrath is their King, but refuses to lead. He is a loner. A warrior. He doesn\u2019t get too close to anyone. He has his band of brothers, but thats about it. When Wrath\u2019s brother Darius asks him to help his only daughter (who is half human) with her Book one of the Black Dagger Brotherhood series... The Black Dagger Brotherhood is a group of vampires here to protect the vampire race. Wrath is the leader of this group- their king, by blood. Wrath was 6 feet, 9 inches of pure terror dressed in leather. Wrath is their King, but refuses to lead. He is a loner. A warrior. He doesn\u2019t get too close to anyone. He has his band of brothers, but thats about it. When Wrath\u2019s brother Darius asks him to help his only daughter (who is half human) with her transition, Wrath refuses. But when something happens to Darius, Wrath feels its his duty to honor his only wish. So he seeks out Beth. Beth is sort of a loner in her own right. She has a job, a few friends, but no one particularly close to her. She grew up in foster care, her mother died during child birth and she always was told her father had passed before she was born. Lately, she has been feeling a little \u2018off\u2019, but hasn\u2019t thought much of it. One night while walking home, Beth gets attacked. Her friends from the force, Jose and Butch try to look out for her. A few nights later, someone is outside of her apartment when she gets home. He says he is there to protect her. She assumes Butch sent him. It is Wrath. Beth feels something for Wrath she has never felt before... Pure unadulterated lust. So she goes for it. And Wrath does not turn her down. Even though Wrath just wants to do his job and help her through her transition, more develops between these two. I loved Wrath and Beth together. Wrath can\u2019 technically see Beth, but he knows she is a beautiful woman. One of my favorite parts...

That\u2019s what you\u2019d see.\u201d (hide spoiler) ] And Beth see\u2019s the beauty in Wrath. This book isn\u2019t only about Wrath and Beth. There is a lot going on. The \u2018war\u2019 between the Lessers and the BDB, plus, the author spends a lot of time introducing us to the members of the brotherhood. Overall: I wouldn\u2019t say I loved this book, but I really enjoyed it! I have a feeling I am going to LOVE some of the others after reading this one. The writing was excellent, I loved all the guys in the BDB. One thing I was a tad disappointed about... there were quite a few sex scenes, they were hot and all- but from what I\u2019d heard I was expecting some serious vampire smut and I was really looking forward to it! But maybe they get a little smuttier as the series continue? Either way, I am really looking forward to reading book 2 next week. After this quote from Rhage, I can already tell I\u2019m going to love him! \u201cYeah.\u201d Rhage sighed. \u201cAll I want is one good female. But I guess I\u2019ll settle for quantity until I find her. Life just sucks, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d If you love paranormal romance like I do, I\u2019m sure you will enjoy this series!

The chemistry between them is beyond exploding. It's a dynamite destroying and crushing my sanity into pieces. \u201cWelcome to the wonderful world of jealousy, he thought. For the price of admission, you get a splitting headache, a nearly irresistable urge to commit murder, and an inferiority complex. Yippee.\u201d The world in BDB is myterious and virile with supernatural creatures. Vampires don't suck blood from human, they drinks from their race. So the story goes around how Wrath tried to push Beth away in the beginning, but she's irresistable. After that, he just can't ignore his heart no more. The romance has the great potential. I loved the ending, it's very exciting to see how the next book will pick up after the most sexy character, Rage. This is my second read. And Dark Lover is still my favoite of this genre. I was so impressed. J.R. Ward narrated her story very well making me feel every character and emotion. 5 Stars. More at https://goo.gl/G0cwHa ...more Yep, I'm reading it again.

I'm very happy this was still so great for me on my 4th read. Even though I do admit to skimming certain sections. I think that is normal after you read a book so many times. :) Original review: Ok, Kelly mentioned vampire porn today in a post and then Heather flagged this as maybe and I saw it in my feed and THEN it made me realize I never wrote a review for this! It's one I just added when I first joined GRs. So... this book: First of all, if you don't like vampires, don't even bother. Second of all, if you don't like romance, don't even bother. Third of all, if you don't like vampire romance, then really, don't bother. But if you do love you some vamps and some PNR, this is absolutely one of the best. J.R. Ward knows her PNR. This series gets stale as it goes on... and on... and on. But in the beginning, this is some good shizz. Her vampires are grind-your-teeth sexy...masculine warriors who curse and drink and kick some ass. And know how to treat a lady. In bed. Yes, it's got some raunchy scenes, cussing, violence, etc. But it's damn good. So, lots of sexy times in this series. I love Wrath and Beth too and they are the first couple. Each book follows the same formula: one hot vampire gets a \"mate.\" They have to fight the bad guy in-between. Yeah, there's actual plot and arcs that carry over and world- building (and well-written sex - wink wink). When I first read this, I was a newb to the PNR genre too, so it was like the best thing ever. Good times. :) Someone posted this pic of Beth and Wrath on Pinterest and even though Wrath is supposed to be physically larger, it's still pretty accurate -and HOT. ...more Holy smokes Dark Lover was bloody brilliant!!!!!!

THE WRITING STYLE Everyone probably already knows this, but J.R Ward's style of writing is absolutely phenomenal ! I love it ! Because of it, i could easily get into the book from the first few chapters and that hasn't happened in god knows how long. The description of everything is brilliant and helps you visualize everything in your head. I could see my Wrath and Beth pretty easily! THE CHARACTERS They are all FABULOUS ! The MC were very well described and developed. I loved Wrath! He's so sexy and sweet! But Beth sometimes got on my nerves - she was being mean to Wrath and i really felt like shutting her up and slapping her in the face. But she got better as the book progressed. THE BROTHERHOOD My main reason for my 5 star rating. Gosh, i think it was the best thing in this whole book. The love, support and loyalty these guys had for one another made me melt! It was so heartwarming and just 'awww'. Who would think that these tough warriors had it in them to care so much about each other? WHO'S MY FAVORITE BROTHER THEN? ................ Zsadist. My emotions go overboard when i read how they treat him! I WANT TO STAB THEM IN THE FREAKING EYE ! Why is everyone so mean to him?! Why is everyone disgusted by the way he looks.

The world building wasn't anything great, the characters were meh, it was basically just porn which I guess I should have expected but dang. This was fraught with instalove, overprotectiveness, and sacrificing a real storyline for the sake of a romantic interest. I can't say I didn't enjoy it because I read it all in one day, and this is the first vampire book I'v 2.5 stars Man, I'm super upset that I raised my expectations for this because Sarah J Maas recommended it.

I can't say I didn't enjoy it because I read it all in one day, and this is the first vampire book I've read in years, but yeah. Just let down after thinking it would be something that would totally capture my attention instead of being.... this. Disappointing. Twilight was better than this. I'm still in shock that all of the characters' names were literally Wrath, Torment, Sadist, Rage, etc. and no one said ANYTHING?????? I guess one thing that I liked about this was that any time the main guy would try and be all like \"you need to do this\" or \"i demand you don't do that\" she's like \"lol swerve ur not the boss of me\" which was refreshing. ...more **5 stars for 6 FEET 6 INCHES of Pure WRATH** \u201cYou don't know this yet.

Little does she know that she is half-vampire, a rare breed. Beth is a strong character who shows some innocence in certain areas, but it\u2019s not annoying. I really enjoy her as a heroine, especially because I\u2019ve seen her grow throughout the 11 books. Wrath makes a promise to an old friend to protect Beth. Things escalate quickly and they GET.IT.ON! (It bothered me the first time around, but I loved it the second time around.) Wrath tries to leave Beth to protect her from himself, but he just can\u2019t stay away. After reading this for the second time, I see how well Ward sets up her characters for future books. She starts so early. I didn\u2019t pay enough attention the first time around. Ward is so detailed in her character development. She knows exactly who they are and what is going to happen 5 books from now! I loved this book even more the second time because I know the characters so well. I\u2019ve been in Ward\u2019s head for 11 books!!! And I still cannot get enough! I am so excited to get more of Wrath and Beth in the 12th book! ...more Errr I dunno. It's so hard to avoid the cliches of this genre, either the main female character is totally uptight, bitchy and ass kicking, or she's some limpid virgin whose loins throb at the sight of crazy tall dudes in leather. I know people love these, and the writings pretty good, not sure I'm hooked though. I'll give it another try. Opening Line: \"Darius looked around the club, taking in the teeming, half-naked bodies on the dance floor.\" This is a beautifully done romance.

Wrath is a sexy, tormented, to die for hero and Beth is simply perfect as his Queen. JR Ward has created a fantastic paranormal world with this series and I can guarantee you'll enjoy your time spent with the Black Dagger Brotherhood. DARK LOVER is ultimately addicting, sexy, erotic, funny and brash with an entertaining yet menacing cast of seriously alpha-male secondary characters who will all leave you wanting more. Wrath is the only purebred vampire left on the planet he is also a King who refuses to lead his people. Almost blind and with a mean temper he prefers to be alone avenging the murder of his parents as he fights an endless battle against the `Lessers' (The antagonists here are a truly evil group of sickly sweet smelling undead who will stop at nothing to eliminate the vampire race) Wrath's only true companions are the members of the Black Dagger Brotherhood. A dangerous gang of eclectic characters each with their own set of issues (and each getting their own upcoming book as well) The Brothers have sworn their loyalties to the King and fight alongside him to protect the vampire race from the `Lessoning Society' awaiting the day when Wrath will ascend to the throne. As we begin the Brother Darius asks Wrath to help his half human daughter through the `change'-an unstoppable transition that will turn her from human to Vampire. This is a very dangerous time and Darius's hope is that the blind King's almost pure blood will guarantee her survival. Wrath initially declines because he doesn't like humans but when Darius is killed Wrath has no choice but to honour his Brothers last wishes. Beth hasn't been feeling like herself lately and having been raised in foster care is completely unaware of her vampire heritage. Her job as a reporter for a local newspaper sees her unknowingly reporting on her own fathers murder. Along the way we are introduced to Butch, a burnt out cop who's in love with Beth. One night Beth awakens to find a gorgeous but heavily armed man dressed in head to toe leather standing in her apartment. She is of course frightened but can't deny the instant attraction even though he appears to have fangs. Beth and Wrath's initial encounter is hot and the sparks never stop flying as Wrath takes on the position of her protector guiding her through `the change.' When Butch witnesses the two of them together he's horrified because Wrath has been fingered as the prime suspect in a string of unsolved murders. The killings have in fact been committed by the `Lessers' and in trying to keep Wrath away from Beth, Butch will only succeed in bringing the evil closer to home. You may be initially put off by the author's odd choice of names for the Brothers. I know I definitely had trouble keeping track of who's who in the beginning. Their names are weird and there are a lot of them to keep track of, each with their own set of issues and gifts, but stick with it. The language (doggen, lesser, shellan etc) was also a bit of an issue at first but thankfully Ward has included a glossary of terms which by the end of the book I found I no longer needed. If you're a fan of paranormal romance then I can't recommend this enough and if this is a re-read for you too I discovered that the forthcoming John Mathew's identity is positively verified in a little scene with the Scribe Virgin near the end. Cheers ...more Well, as a self-confessed stalker and worshipper of Tatiana's reviews, I had serious reservations about this book. In fact, I had serious reservations about the whole series. Yeah, yeah, we all have different tastes but I can't help it, in my opinion Tatiana has got it completely right every time. However... I liked this one. It was never ever going to get 5 stars, simply because it was always inevitably going to be compared to the Fever series with it being in the paranormal romance genre, but I Well, as a self-confessed stalker and worshipper of Tatiana's reviews, I had serious reservations about this book. In fact, I had serious reservations about the whole series. Yeah, yeah, we all have different tastes but I can't help it, in my opinion Tatiana has got it completely right every time. However... I liked this one. It was never ever going to get 5 stars, simply because it was always inevitably going to be compared to the Fever series with it being in the paranormal romance genre, but I did enjoy the read. Wrath was no Jericho Barrons (aka immortal sex on legs) but I liked that he had a back story rather than being another typical two-dimensional vampire to add to the ever-growing pile. And I loved the Brothers, their inter-chemistry with each other and Butch was what can only be described as cute - for serious want of a better word. I just don't know why so many authors think that a romance must be all \"Oh, my love, you are everything to me...\" and \"Their eyes met and suddenly there was no one else in the world but the two of them\". Sorry to bring it up again , but I absolutely loved how there was none of that crap in the Fever books , it was deliciously sexy and they obviously loved each other in a way that Karen Marie Moning didn't have to point out in every single sentence... because it was so wonderfully obvious! One of my favourite parts is when Mac discovers who was really behind her sister's death and Barrons comes in all grumpy and cynical until she says his name. And that whole wonderful part where he just talks to her and understands... he never says \"you are the only reason I want to live\" but you know how deep he feels for her. Now that's literary romance for you. Okay, so before this review is completely taken over with my obsession love for the Fever series , back to the BDB. Beth is a so-so heroine, I'm hoping she improves. She's gutsy and not a pushover, which I like, but she's also a bit lame. The author needs to give her more of a personality (like someone whose name begins with 'M' in a series whose name begins with 'F'), so far I don't dislike her but I'm going to need to care if I'm hoping to continue with this series. Which I am. It's not a bad start at all and I'm looking forward to exploring the other brothers, especially Zsadist - what is that guy's story?? He intrigues me most of all. He isn't pretentious, he isn't a hero, finally something gritty to get my teeth into. Let's see where it goes from here. ...more", "Title": "Dark Lover"},
