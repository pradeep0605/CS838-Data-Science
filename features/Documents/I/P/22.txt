She reports on the Holocaust, the Armenian genocide, and especially her major areas of research- Rwanda and Serbia. However, Powers is content to simply recount major instances of crimes against humanity that the U.S. and other major Western powers simply ignored (a worthy historical task), rather than to document the major atrocities the U.S. supported/participated in (the far more morally serious and honest task). While she is scrupulous in her documentation of the horrors of Rwanda and Iraq, her sections on Indo-China fail miserably. She provides a lengthy and conventional chapter on the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, without mentioning to inform us about the U.S.'s massive contribution to such atrocities (only side references are provided). Additionally, she mentions in a rather depraved manner, that \"In 1975, when its ally, the oil-producing, anti-Communist Indonesia, invaded Timor, killing between 100,000 and 200,000 civilians, the United States looked away\" (147).<---F> In actuality, the U</---F>.S. did not look away: it funded the genocide, and President Carter deliberately escalated the intensity of the atrocities. This is the essence of Power's political backwardness. Pointing to the atrocities of official enemies is easy, it is far more difficult and necessary to point to the atrocities of the U.S. and its allies. Nowhere does Powers discuss Israel and the Palestinians, nowhere does she discuss Pinochet, or the Contras, or Kissinger for that matter. So long as the the liberal intelligentsia refuses to stare in the mirror, the world will continue to be an arena of exploitation, injustice, and crimes against humanity. ...more A passionate, but incomplete look at the problems of genocide and intervention.

Haiti and the Duvaliers. Mobutu in Zaire. Noriega. Suharto. Videla in Argentina. Any dictatorial bastard who claimed to be fighting Communism was thus approved and aided, because he's our son of a bitch. Perhaps in the early stages of the Cold War, such 'lesser of two evils' talk was necessary, with the absolute terror coming out of Stalin's or Mao's little empires. But such is the inherent contradiction in foreign policy. The ideal democratic peace will be brought about by power plays and force. Would such ideas be excusable now? Presently, the author has a position in the Obama administration, and was the primary reason they decided for intervention in Libya. There, at least, this was widely approved. Of course, our own ugly history makes an appearance there, as new records have shown that Bush II, after removing Qaddafi from the 'Axis of Evil', cooperated with him on imprisonment and torture. http://www.hrw.org/reports/2012/09/05...

I have read extensively about the Armenian Genocide (Meds Yeghern), and the Shoah, or Holocaust of European Jews. These parts of the book added little to my knowledge. But, the rest of the book was very informative and distressing, relaying the stories of genocide after the world had declared \"Never again\"! These were the stories of the Cambodian, Kurdish, Bosnian, Rwandan, Srebrenica (part of the Bosnian, and Kosovar genocides. The history is made more interesting because these things happened in my lifetime! While I was going about my life, going to school, getting married, and building my career, these slaughters were taking place and being debated and reported on. While I remember bits of some of these tragedies, more about others, I don't remember the details, or what I felt at the time. (I assume horror when the details were finally revealed.) I thus share in the shame of knowing atrocities happened on my watch. I did not protest, write letters, or raise hell! I felt self righteous as I asserted, when reading about the Shoah, that I would have protested, done everything in my power, to make a difference in ending the slaughter. However, I will be one of those future generations will ask about. Why did you do nothing? Very humbling! The rest of the book relates the history of Mr. Lemkin, a Polish Jew, who lost family members in the Shoah, who coined the term genocide, and gave the rest of his life working to see this become an international crime, punishable in International Courts as \"crimes against humanity\". The United States took over 40 years to ratify this United Nations resolution, long after many other countries had done so. The first case of genocide coming before an international tribunal, after the Nuremberg trials, was that involving the Serbs against Muslims in the 1990s! We read about the foot dragging of the United States, over and over again, through multiple presidencies, and see how the State Departments response to many atrocities, was exactly the same as their response to the Holocaust/ Shoah! I gained respect for some politicians, and lost some respect for others, who looked the other way, even multiple times! The attacks on American soil of 9/11 brought it home in a way like no other. When a group wants to annihilate another group for \"who\" they are, not for anything they have done, it is Chilling! I will end with a quote from the book, which shook me. She was discussing the Rwandan massacre, explaining that they experienced the equivalent of more than two World Trade Center attacks every single day for 100 days! \"When, on September 12, 2001, the United States turned for help to its friends around the world, Americans were gratified by the overwhelming response. When the Tutsi cried out (or the Armenians, Jews, Cambodians, Bosnians, Kurds), by contrast, every country in the world turned away.\" ...more Samantha Power has written a very well-researched book profiling cases of genocide in the 21st century (in Turkey, Nazi Germany, Cambodia, Iraq, Rwanda, Balkans, Srebrenica, and Kosovo). Powers descibed the crusade taken on by numerous heroic individuals to avert genocide (none of whom I had previously heard of), such as Raphael Lemkin, William Proxmire, Henry Morgenthau, and James Kenneth Galbraith.

Powers descibed the crusade taken on by numerous heroic individuals to avert genocide (none of whom I had previously heard of), such as Raphael Lemkin, William Proxmire, Henry Morgenthau, and James Kenneth Galbraith. Power not only describes the recognition and responses to genocide in each of the case studies profiled, but she also describes the birth of the word genocide and the UN treaty that criminalized it. We take for granted the recognition and definition of the term \"genocide\", but at the time of the Armenian genocide in Turkey, the word did not even exist. We also take for granted the existence of a UN treaty condemning genocide, but it took 40 years after UN adoption for the US to even ratify the treaty, fearing that accusations of genocide might be brought against the US. Power reveals many examples of the impotence of the United Nations (particularly the United States) in preventing or intervening in mass killings in the 20th century. Not until national interests were in jeopardy (and after genocide had already taken a heavy toll) did the United States and the international community act. For example, not until American oil interests in Kuwait were threatened did the United States intervene against Iraq in its extermination of the Kurds. The Anfal Campaign of 1988 carried out by Saddam Hussein killed ~150,000 Kurds and importantly was carried out with chemical weapons; yet, the US showed a range of reactions (that typify its response to the other atrocities as well): denial, blame of the victims, hope that perpetrators could be swayed, downplaying of the accusations, and simply inaction. In the end, there was insurmountable (with rare exceptions) inertia to even condemning acts of genocide. Power is critical of previous American presidents (particularly hard on G. Bush I and Bill Clinton) for their inaction, but she is balanced in her lambast. She provides sufficient details on the political climate and internal debates in the various administrations that provides contexts in which the decisions to not intervene took place. She frequently concedes ground to counterpoints, such as the idea that action might actually exacerbate genocide. This adds depth to her book and gives her credibility as a realist rather than some hippie liberal. The book does not get a 5/5 from me because of the lack of coverage of atrocities that the US contributed to. Powers asserts numerous times that the US was concerned that \"rogue\" states might bring up genocide charges against the US, but she did not elaborate on the validity of these claims. The US was complicit in and contributed to genocide carried out by Pinochet in Chile and the military in Guatemala, among others. Also, US treatment of Native Americans could also be counted as a genocide. None of these accounts were mentioned. These inconvenient aspects of our history is crucial in understanding why the United States dragged its feet on ratifying the UN treaty on genocide and why the US voted against the creation of the International Criminal Court, a permanent tribunal to prosecute genocide and other crimes against humanity. These details are important int understanding why the United States has been so inept in responding to these human atrocities, but were not covered. I would describe my political views as that of a pacifist, but this book has turned me towards the idea of the need for a truly independent international body (rather than the UN) that can and will intervene militarily to avert genocide. All in all, this was a stellar piece of investigative work that taught me a lot about the history of genocide. The progress in making genocide history is painstakingly slow, but the progress is apparent and of course the hope that the world will be able to shake inertia toresponding to genocide in the future. ...more I have a lot of complaints and very few positive remarks about this book. I'll start with the little good: I enjoyed the biographical information about Raphael Lemkin. That said, there are many other more in-depth books about him out there that could tell an even fuller story. The majority of this book, however, was a hollow argument for the superiority of liberal interventionism.

The majority of this book, however, was a hollow argument for the superiority of liberal interventionism. The structure of each case study goes like this: a genocide started; the US MAY have borne some blame for the conditions that allowed the violence to start; the US didn't intervene; OR the US did intervene and everything went great. The historical background for all the genocides is superficial at best. For example, Power never even addresses the issue of how the Hutu and Tutsi identities came into being in Rwanda. She mentions that there was some animosity based on the structure of the colonial administration and not much else. I understand that the majority of this book was dedicated to the American response to genocides throughout history, but not properly contextualizing the situation is at best a mistake and at worst a deliberate attempt to strengthen an argument. I was amazed that this book was so long, given how little detail she put into the case studies. Most importantly, though, I think this book operates from an inherently false and dangerous premise. The basic assumption from which the whole book flows is that the US is a world superpower (true) and has the means to stop violence around the world (also true). Few people can dispute those two facts. And yes, the US should make as many efforts as possible to stop violence, especially genocide, around the world. But the US is also one of the leading causes of violence around the world. From Chile in the 1970s to Iraq in the 2000s, the US has been responsible for high levels of violence and human rights abuse. Power doesn't even mention these points, instead focusing on how the US could have stopped other states who were killing people. Presenting only this half of the coin is to portray the US as a state that just hasn't done enough a couple of times to stop these huge acts of violence committed by other states. That is the danger of this book's premise: propagating the idea that the American government is just a bystander that failed to act, and not a primary source of death and murder. The cases Power points to are correctly labeled as examples of American failure and shame. The US could and should have done more to stop the Rwandan genocide and many others like it. But the US also should not have led the overthrow of many democratically elected governments and inserted strongmen who oppressed and murdered their own citizens (Pinochet and Mobutu, to name two). Not pointing out both of these faults in American foreign policy is, again, either intellectually lazy or worse. ...more Grinding, grueling, exhausting account of a series of genocides and the United States's response \u2013 or generally lack thereof.

The criticism is accurate, though I think it's a product of the focus of this book very specifically on passive complicity. I had read excerpts of this over the years, and I'm glad I finally sat down and went through all of it, cover-to-cover. But this is a first generation book, and now I want the fifth generation, or the seventh generation, if you know what I mean. Because Power spends a lot of time documenting American disinterest in mass death, and some time talking about the reasons, but the reasons are very . . . cerebral. This economic interest, that political exigency, a few general comments about racism. This book made me think a lot about pain, and being the observer of it. I mean, most of us catch glimpses of indescribable anguish out of the corners of our eyes all the time, but we've developed defensive emotional blinders. But once in a while, someone looks at the newspaper headline that ten thousand other people read and forgot, and that one person is seared. Irrevocably changed just by knowing that five thousand people halfway around the world were \"disappeared.\" I've known some people like that, and worked with them. One of them was the first person to make me read excerpts of this book. I want the book about those people. And the contextual, psychological, physiological, etc. differences between them and the rest of us. And the book that takes a deeper, more honest look at the psychology of passive complicity, not just its economic logic. Because Power wrote mostly about when and where and who, and left me pretty messed up over why . ...more \u0422\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0438 \u043b\u0456\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0435

It follows the story of genocide from the slaughter of Armenians in 1915 through the Jewish Holocaust 30 years later, and on to the Khmer-Rouge sponsored killing fields in Cambodia in the late '70s, the mass murder of Iraqi Kurds by Saddam's government in the late '80s, the Bosnian and Rwandan genocides in the early and mid '90s and ending with the massacre of Kosovar Albanians in the late '90s. In almost all cases, the American government sat on its ass and did virtually nothing, despite ample warnings of what was coming, alarm bells rung by observers and survivors about the crime in progress, and lackadaisical attempts to punish perpetrators in the aftermath. This book is very well-documented and well-researched. It is also pretty depressing. We have put our faith in certain institutions of national and international government to keep the peace, and this book begs the question: when both the United States, and the international peace-keeping organization it helped create, the United Nations, fail to step in when men butcher hundreds of thousands or millions of each other like dogs, was our faith in these institutions well-placed? The book exposes the litany of excuses that the US government and the UN trotted out for doing nothing, but it raises another question, not so much what could really be done to stop a genocide in progress, but what has to happen in the future to make genocide interdiction happen? What price must we pay to save the lives of our fellow men? A friend of mine reccommended this book to me while I was doing research for an author who is writing about the feeble American response to the Holocaust going on in Nazi-occupied Europe. I saw with my own eyes State Department cables by the dozens full of excuses as to why we could nothing to rescue Jews from Nazi extermination. It struck me that one of the difficulties which governments have in making the decision to stop genocide is that the goal of governments in regards to the rest of the world is to further its own interests, not to further the interests of all mankind. This is precisely why the United Nations is so often paralyzed: because its individual member nations have a cacophony of clashing interests that rarely coincide. This is a good thing to keep in mind when considering the problem of how to motivate governments to take steps to halt genocide. I haven't finished reading it yet (I'm more than 3/4 through), but this is a good book well worth reading. ...more The excruciating detail with which Power researched an assembled this book is evident from page one.

My only problem with this book, if it can be called that, is the way I feel it ends without offering a more specific argument for where the United States goes from here. This, I feel, is probably in large part because of the nature of these situations. To plan out a future American response to curtail the \"next Rwanda\" can leave us woefully unprepared, for example, in dealing with the current Darfur. In the end, I feel this book is a call to action for Americans. I'm still idealistic enough to believe that US politicians will respond to issues upon which their constituencies place a high cost, so to that end I say \"Read this book!\" Get informed! Be attentive enough to situations like this that the media outlets are forced to give them greater scrutiny. An informed populace is also one much better suited to an honest discussion about the merits of US intervention, to which our politicians will respond. ...more Samantha Power gives a compelling account of the twentieth century history of genocide and American responses (largely non-responses) to this horrendous evil.

She covers a sobering reality with a journalists skill of both careful documentation and rendering a riveting narrative. She begins with the life of Rafael Lemkin, a Polish lawyer of Jewish descent who became fascinated at the crimes against humanity wrought by the Turks against Armenians in World War 1. Fleeing Poland when he recognizes the same patterns in the Third Reich, he suffered the loss of most of his family and became a lifelong advocate against these crimes, to which he gave the term \"genocide\". His crowning achievement was to participate in the drafting of the UN conventions against genocide. And so we come to the US response. Lemkin died in 1959 without seeing the US ratify these conventions, which would have done so much to strengthen the world's response to genocide. We see the bloody regime of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and the war-weary non-response of the US. Ultimately, our former enemies, the Vietnamese brought down this bloody regime and exposed their crimes. Only in 1985, after Reagan's disastrous visit to Bitburg did he push for the passage of the genocide conventions, although in a qualified form to protect the US against genocide charges. Sadly, even the Holocaust, even Cambodia are insufficient to arouse the conscience of the US. Power documents a studied avoidance by our political leaders, that discounts evidence of genocide, that equivocates on calling these crimes \"genocide\", that fails to use even US diplomatic and economic influence against genocide, and is unwilling to risk American lives to save the lives of the thousands who died in the successive genocides she chronicles in Kurdish Iraq, Bosnia, Rwanda, and Kosovo. By and large, Power chalks this up to a determination that American interests were not directly involved, resulting in the moral equivocations to justify inaction. The latter part of the book chronicles what can happen when the US does act, as it finally did in Kosovo. Goaded by political opposition, the Clinton administration authorized US involvement with NATO bombings and subsequent peace-keeping efforts that brought an end to the Milosevic regime's efforts to exterminate or \"cleanse\" the land of Albanians in Kosovo. And subsequently it supported the seizure of Milosevic and many other war criminals to be tried for genocide at the Hague. Very belatedly Rafael Lemkin's dream is realized. The book ends in 2002, just after 9/11. Since then we have witnessed genocide in the South Sudan, and a current ominous situation in the Central African Republic. Samantha Power is now US ambassador to the United Nations and a senior official in the Obama administration. It will be interesting to see whether Power can change from the inside the culture of inaction she decried from the outside. ...more Your first reaction to seeing this title is probably \u201cAlex, why on earth would I ever read a 500+ page nonfiction book about genocide?

Summary: the record isn\u2019t pretty, to put it mildly. I decided to pick up this book after seeing the video of Power\u2019s powerful September 6 speech making the case for U.S. military action in Syria, following the Assad regime\u2019s chemical weapons attack outside Damascus on August 21, which killed over 1,400 Syrians. Given Power\u2019s successful advocacy inside the Obama administration for robust U.S. military intervention in the past \u2013 she reportedly played a key role in convincing Obama to intervene militarily in Libya in 2011 \u2013 I thought this book would be a timely glimpse into Power's point of view as she sought to persuade Obama (and a skeptical U.S. public) to intervene in Syria. Although U.S. action in Syria hasn't materialized, A Problem From Hell is well worth reading. Clearly written and passionately argued, Power's account is largely an attack on what Anthony Lake described as \"a basic intellectual approach which views foreign policy as a lifeless, bloodless set of abstractions.\" The villains that Power singles out for the harshest criticism are the senior U.S. officials (and presidents) that knew the full extent of the horrific evil being perpetrated in places like Cambodia, Bosnia, and Rwanda, but consistently sought to either ignore or excuse it. Warren Christopher, Bill Clinton's first secretary of state, gets particularly brutal treatment in this regard. Advocates of U.S. intervention in Syria have often tried to draw comparisons to other historical conflicts (Bosnia, for instance). While these types of analogies are highly problematic because of the dramatic differences between the conflicts, what is stunningly similar, throughout the twentieth century right up through Libya and Syria today, are the arguments that the opponents of intervention make. Probably the greatest strength of Power's book is the way she tackles and refutes these common anti-intervention arguments \u2013 summarized by economist Albert Hirschmann as \u201cfutility\u201d (our actions won't make a difference), \u201cperversity\u201d (intervention will only make things worse for the people we're trying to help), and \u201cjeopardy\u201d (intervention will jeopardize other U.S. foreign policy goals) \u2013 head on. A few other notable examples: 1) There are \u201cno good guys\u201d - In virtually every case, U.S. officials intentionally \"accentuate the grayness and moral ambiguity of each crisis,\" emphasizing \"atrocities on all sides\" of the conflict, and claiming that there are \"no good guys.\" Since genocides usually occur in the context of war (and civil wars at that), it's easy for officials to defend inaction by claiming that the U.S. doesn't want to \"take sides,\" implying two more or less equivalent opponents. In 1992, George H.W. Bush's administration defended its policy of non-intervention in Bosnia by insisting that there were \"no good guys\" in Bosnian conflict, even though the Bosnian Muslims were mostly unarmed due to an international arms embargo and were essentially at the mercy of well-equipped Bosnian Serb forces. The Clinton administration continued this line of reasoning; in 1993, Bill Clinton defended the U.S.'s continued policy of inaction in Bosnia with the following statement: \"Until these folks get tired of killing each other, bad things will continue to happen.\" (real quote) 2) We need more proof \u2013 A common theme in the U.S. reaction to genocide overseas is a vague admission that something bad might be happening, but an insistence that \"more concrete evidence is needed\" before the U.S. can commit to taking action (despite often already having overwhelming proof in hand). Power notes the notorious difficulty in obtaining physical evidence of atrocities due to severe lack of access for foreign observers (due to an unstable security situation, ongoing civil wars, xenophobic government policies, etc.), and also criticizes the West's repeated unwillingness to believe the accounts of refugees or opponents of the regime, who are often dismissed as \u201cbiased\u201d or exaggerating for political gain. Power also notes not just an unwillingness to believe such accounts because of their \u201chearsay\u201d nature, but because we simply cannot believe them. U.S. officials disbelieve accounts of mass slaughter because they usually sound unbelievable. Since the U.S. foreign policy establishment is built to view all parties as \u201crational actors,\u201d incredulous U.S. officials often have a hard time wrapping their minds around the conclusion that other governments would slaughter their own citizens en masse. They also refuse to believe because of the moral implications for U.S. action should the stories be true. Writes Power: \"U.S. officials have been reluctant to imagine the unimaginable because of the implications...they have taken shelter in the fog of plausible deniability. They have used the search for certainty as an excuse for paralysis and postponement.\" 3) It will cost too much \u2013 Opponents of U.S. intervention often cite a high proposed cost, both in terms of U.S. resources and (in the case of military action) in the lives of U.S. service members. Power notes that the Pentagon has consistently and vehemently opposed U.S. military action to prevent or stop genocide in every single case, often even to the extent of exaggerating required troop levels and expected costs. Slippery-slope arguments are frequently employed: any intervention by the U.S., critics warn, will inevitably lead to another Vietnam (or, in contemporary parlance, another Iraq). Better to play it safe and do nothing than take any action and risk getting bogged down in an endless quagmire. But as the late Richard Holbrooke wrote in a 1992 op-ed, \"[It] is not a choice between Vietnam and doing nothing...doing nothing now risks a far greater and more costly involvement later.\" As Power noted in her September 2013 Syria speech, \u201cthere is no risk-free door number two.\u201d Inaction has a heavy cost...though policymakers may prefer these costs, however high they may be, due to the simple fact that they are often longer-term and may not surface until long after that particular administration has left office. In addition, Power warns in her book that \"citizens victimized by genocide or abandoned by the international community do not make good neighbors, as their thirst for vengeance, their irredentism, and their acceptance of violence as a means of generating change can turn them into future threats.\u201d This warning, written more than a decade ago, is a warning that surely rings true today when one thinks about long-term consequences for Syria. Power's overall argument is that it was not lack of knowledge or influence that caused the U.S. to stop genocide throughout the twentieth century, but rather a lack of will. Power's brutal conclusion is that the U.S. record on genocide is not one of \"failure,\" but rather one of success. In nearly every single case, U.S. officials successfully avoided having to taking responsibility or action to stop the massacres. She also faults U.S. society as a whole -- without political pressure, it is virtually impossible to get U.S. officials to do anything to stop genocide. U.S. officials have routinely cited lack of public support for intervention in foreign crises as an excuse for inaction. Power notes, however, the circular relationship leaders have with public opinion -- officials fail to lead by rallying the public's support to intervene to prevent genocide, and then cite lack of public support as grounds for inaction. Power also acknowledges the difficulty of getting the U.S. public to care about genocide -- however horrific -- when it occurs thousands of miles from U.S. shores and in light of competing priorities. Writing just months after 9/11, Power readily admits that when it comes to choosing between fighting terrorism or preventing genocide in a third world country, it's hard to argue that the U.S. shouldn't devote all available resources towards protecting our own citizens. But she also offers this bit of perspective: \"In 1994 Rwanda, a country of just 8 million, experienced the numerical equivalent of more than two World Trade Center attacks every single day for 100 days. On an American scale this would mean 23 million people murdered in three months. When, on September 12, 2001, the United States turned for help to its friends around the world, Americans were gratified by the overwhelming response. When the Tutsi cried out, by contrast, every single country in the world turned away.\" Well, you might say, the U.S. can hardly be expected to send in the infantry every time civilians are threatened anywhere in the world by a murderous regime. Our resources are limited, and other countries in those regions should bear some of the burden too. Which is a fair point. But Power's response is that \"what is most shocking about America's reaction to [the genocides of the 20th century] is not that the United States refused to deploy U.S. ground forces to combat the atrocities. For much of the century, even the most ardent interventionists did not lobby for U.S. ground invasions. What is most shocking is that U.S. policymakers did almost nothing to deter the crime.\" Indeed, in many cases (such as in the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and Saddam Hussein in Iraq) we even actively supported the perpetrators *while the genocides were occurring.* Some of Power's arguments are less convincing \u2013 her early-2000s optimism about the International Criminal Court, for example, hasn't exactly been borne out by events. Regardless, this is a book that will make even the most uber-realist or non-interventionist think hard about what they believe. \"How many of us who look back at the genocides of the twentieth century, including the Holocaust, do not believe that [advocates of intervention] were right?\u201d Power challenges in her conclusion. \u201cHow many of us do not believe that the presidents, senators, bureaucrats, journalists, and ordinary citizens who did nothing, choosing to look away rather than to face hard choices and wrenching moral dilemmas, were wrong?\" ...more In \"Dress to Kill\" , Eddie Izzard says: But there were other mass murderers that got away with it!

Hitler killed people next door... \u201cOh... stupid man!\u201d After a couple of years, we won't stand for that, will we? I thought of this line often while I was reading \"A Problem from Hell\": America and the Age of Genocide because Izzard in his own way really nails the sad conclusion that you come to reading Power's book, which is that it's hard to get people to care about genocides, and, even if you do succeed in that, by the time you've proven your case, it's too late for many victims. Power analyzes the lackluster response of the United States to several post-WWII genocides, and concludes that our current system functions properly according to its own flawed purpose. That goal is to involve the U.S. only when its own interests are threatened--or even to stand deliberately aside when the perpetrators of a genocide are the enemies of an opponent (the genocidal enemies of our enemies are our friends?). For example, Power shows how Iraq's stance against Iran prevented the U.S. from intervening when Saddam Hussein gassed the Kurds. Power explains the history of the term \"genocide\" and how it grew up in the aftermath of the Holocaust; although that event inspired interest in and commitment to stopping genocide, it also gave people a very specific idea of what qualified as genocide. When later events didn't \"measure up\" to the Holocaust in terms of the percentage of the population killed or the means used (killing versus sterilization, for example), observers got tangled up in terminology and excused themselves from decisive action. Before reading this book, I was familiar with Power's ideas from her articles in The Atlantic Monthly and elsewhere. I'm making the odd choice to give a Pulitzer Prize-winning and very well-reviewed book a not very good rating (for those who actually put any stock in my ratings...). The reason is that I felt this book was poorly edited: with the main text clocking in at over 500 pages, Power had a hard time strongly pulling her themes together under the weight of so much documentation and detail. I think that any nonexpert who isn't trying to marshal these specific facts would get her message better from one of her articles. And the message isn't a very happy one. Indeed, when you consider the forces that Power describes, it seems even less likely to me that the U.S. would intervene in, say, Darfur, than it did before.

Here she focuses on the United States, a late, a very late signatory (and that with amendments and qualifications), and its history of weaseling out of its obligations under the law by the denial of the obvious. What I didn't know before reading this book is that the criteria for a judgment of genocide concern the intent to destroy a culture and acts towards that end, acts which do not necessarily involve mass homicide but may include such things as forced sterilization, separation of the sexes, rape and the destruction of cultural institutions such as libraries, museums, temples, schools etc. One hopes that Ms. Power remains firm in her convictions... ...more This book really consists of two parts.

A shocking, thorough account of genocide in the 20th century, and America's response. Power is obviously against genocide, but refreshingly balanced in her perspective and the picture she paints. She provides context for each instance of genocide, and a detailed chronology of when people knew what and how decisions were made. It really shows just how difficult it is making decisions in government leadership, but also manages to reveal some relatively simple options that would have been implementable without ground forces. Goes into detail on Armenia, the Holocaust, Cambodia, Iraq, Bosnia, Rwanda, Srebrenica, and Kosovo.

This book, a Pulitzer Prize winner, is a classic and deserves its reputation. If Power's tone is just a bit too self-righteous for my tastes, her outrage at the world's anemic responses to modern genocides, and particularly those of the United States, is fully warranted by her exhaustive and heart-rending research.

If Power's tone is just a bit too self-righteous for my tastes, her outrage at the world's anemic responses to modern genocides, and particularly those of the United States, is fully warranted by her exhaustive and heart-rending research. Reading the book today, one necessarily muses about Power's own success in preventing contemporary genocides as U.S. ambassador to the UN, especially the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Russian and Syrian governments and their ISIS adversaries. While Ambassador Power has emphatically condemned the crimes committed in the Syrian civil war, her government did precious little to stop them, Obama's \"red line\" notwithstanding. Some have accused the Israelis of genocide by expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank (I am not one of those), but the accusation illustrates one of the problems in defeating this scourge: ambiguity of the term \"genocide\" itself. Acts of genocide need not reproduce the consequences of the Holocaust, but exactly what acts does it include? At what point do crimes like murder and rape cease being despicable felonies and become genocide? How are national leaders supposed to know? The ambiguities of the UN Genocide Convention (formally the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide) with regard to the legal elements of genocide and other matters are only some of the imponderables that the West generally, and the United States in particular, have used to justify inaction in deterring or stopping these acts. Indeed, Ms. Power reserves her most bitter criticisms for the U.S. government. The United States, she claims, \"repeatedly allowed genocide\" and \"did almost nothing to deter the crime\" (p. 504). \"The real reason,\" she writes, that \"the United States did not do what it could and should have done to stop genocide\" was because American \"leaders did not want to\" (p. 508). The United States government was not heartless or itself genocidal, but rather was reluctant to expend the lives and treasure necessary to make a decisive difference, especially when there was little if any American public support for military action (p.509) and the facts on the ground were unclear. American leaders were cautious about even using the \"g-word\" for fears that it would galvanize public opinion into demanding rash military action, or that the government would be accused of exaggerating the problem in order to justify U.S. military imperialism. Ms. Power also claims that American officials were reluctant to label a situation genocide because they believed that a finding of genocide \"carried with it a legal and moral ... imperative to act\" (p. 508). Genocide anywhere creates a moral imperative for states to act, but the legal obligations imposed on states by the Genocide Convention are a different matter. The Convention requires state parties to enact domestic laws prohibiting genocide, and to prosecute or extradite those individuals charged with this crime; the Convention does not, however, require or even permit a state party to apply military force unilaterally in order to prevent genocide in another country , notwithstanding the title of the convention itself. Article VIII of the Convention provides: Any Contracting Party may call upon the competent organs of the United Nations to take such action under the Charter of the United Nations as they consider appropriate for the prevention and suppression of acts of genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in article III. There simply is no international legal authority much less an obligation for states to prevent genocide committed by other states, even if perhaps there ought to be. The only political entity with the authority to interfere in the domestic affairs of another state, which is what the prevention of genocide amounts to, is the UN Security Council or, in some unique cases, the General Assembly. Any belief to the contrary by U.S. government attorneys simply demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of international law. It was relatively easy for Ms. Power to criticize the U.S. government as a reporter. Things must seem a little different when one occupies the U.S. seat in the United Nations. What has Ms. Power learned about the problem of genocide from her days as an ambassador? I, for one, anxiously await her next book about her own role as a high-ranking U.S. official in a world where genocide remains too common and America has continued its pathetic response to this ongoing problem. ...more Not easy to read, but essential reading for everyone: just to take the atrocities of this century and to look at them one after another is beyond words and an amazing accomplishment.

She started as a journalist and now is the US Ambassador to the UN. I really appreciate how careful she was to portray in wonderful detail the heroes in this story of genocide, because when you read the book, the depression induced by it can only be mitigated by the men and woman who never gave up their quests to name and prevent these atrocities. I never really knew their names, and it is such a tribute to them that she details their struggles. Again, true heroes, implacable to the end, characterized as annoying but again, I am so glad they have walked the earth. The book is not perfect, it left me with a lot of questions, the whys of things, how on earth we can't learn from our mistakes, etc. It should have been entitled something more like, a history of America and genocide, since I was expecting more answers, more advice for all of us going forward. It was a straightforward report of the genocides, causes, effects,etc. Definitely being politically active and NOISY seems to be extremely important, and seeking out the news the mainstream media can begin to competently cover is a start. Not easy to read. The author begins the book by talking about her own skepticism in the Balkan conflict that it would be as brutal as it was, her belief that humans won't or can't commit such atrocities against their fellow humans. I know that feeling. Never again is what leaders say especially if it fits into their campaign speeches. Since this book was published, we have seen human rights abuses in so many places and genocide in Darfur, still not prosecuted and eclipsed by the separation of Sudan and South Sudan. I do think that the idea of labeling such mass murders to eradicate cultures and ethnicities as genocide was important, I just am not sure it matters enough. The complexity of world affairs and politics is a gargantuan barrier, always. We are constrained by our innocence and by the foreign countries composition of rebels and civil wars and general disorganization and our own national interests and our war on terror. I am still hopeful, and again, so grateful to the heroic men and woman who fight on the side of hope. ...more Samantha Power gives a well selected, episodic history of genocide in the twentieth century, a history of the development of the term \"genocide\" and, most importantly the sorry record of the United States in not intervening into situations in which hundreds of thousands or millions of innocent people were killed based solely on their religion, ethnicity or nationality. She is most convincing in showing how the administration in power will always oppose intervention in humanitarian disasters and Samantha Power gives a well selected, episodic history of genocide in the twentieth century, a history of the development of the term \"genocide\" and, most importantly the sorry record of the United States in not intervening into situations in which hundreds of thousands or millions of innocent people were killed based solely on their religion, ethnicity or nationality. She is most convincing in showing how the administration in power will always oppose intervention in humanitarian disasters and will always find reasons not to intervene. They assume that the risks will always outweight the benefits--there is little political capital to be won from sending troops to stop one group of foreigners from killing another group and a great deal to lose on the domestic front. One example, possibly the most egregious, was the slaughter in Rwanda. The Clinton administration with Secretary of State Warren Christopher as point man, did everything they could to avoid involvement in Rwanda, going so far as to advise the United Nations to abandon the doomed to their fate. A few battalions of Marines could have stopped most of the slaughter in its tracks but the U.S. chose to stay on the sidelines and watch the slaughter then claim that there wasn't enough information to make a decision. This is unfortunately typical of our history when faced with genocidal slaughter. We not only don't intervene with troops but also refuse to impose or even support diplomatic or commercial sanctions against murderous regimes. The first Bush administration, knowing that the Kurds in northern Iraq were being put in concentration camps and murdered, continued to support Saddam Hussein because he was also fighting a proxy war against Iran. Power has long experience as a reporter and scholar in the failure of international organizations to stop genocide and has no faith in them as such. She thinks that individuals can make a difference--if they are both willing to do so and are in positions of power. This is a very powerful and necessary book and is very highly recommended. ...more Certainly a groundbreaking and seminal work in genocide policy work, even read over a decade after its release. The book gives you a primer in the history of international law, then spends the bulk of the text on a series of case study-esque sections on genocides in the last 100 years, including both international and domestic American factors that led to the United States failing to take effective action in most cases.

The book gives you a primer in the history of international law, then spends the bulk of the text on a series of case study-esque sections on genocides in the last 100 years, including both international and domestic American factors that led to the United States failing to take effective action in most cases. It's obvious that Bosnia and Kosovo are the two conflicts Power feels closest to, which isn't surprising because she worked as a reporter there in the early 1990s at the height of the genocide. Those sections are written both succinctly and passionately, and do an excellent job of communicating both the scope of what was happening on the ground and the complex machinations within the United States that caused U.S. inaction. However, other sections of the book weren't as scintillating. Sometimes, I feel like important information is introduced as an afterthought--in the Rwanda chapter, Madeline Albright, who Power cites as \"the most outspoken figure within the Clinton administration for intervention\" is referenced only in a small paragraph. In the chapters on Cambodia and Armenia, the facts presented lacked a consistent thread of analysis to tie them all to their policy outcomes. Also, there were enough punctuation errors that I at times found them distracting from the reading, though I was reading from a first edition. On the whole, the book is well-written, has several brilliant conclusions drawn from the information it presents, and remains as relevant in 2013 as it was in 2002. ...more Genocide did not even exist as a term until Raphael Lemkin, a Jewish Polish lawyer and survivor of the Holocaust, invented the term after the close of World War II. Before that time, Churchill described it as a \"crime with no name\". The best that was offered was \"barbarities\" and \"vandalisms\" which lacked moral authority. It wasn't until 1948 that the UN was finally able to come up with a working definition of \"genocide\".

It wasn't until 1948 that the UN was finally able to come up with a working definition of \"genocide\". Genocide was not entered into force as a UN Convention until 1951 and it would be 40 more years before it would be ratified (\"with reservations\") by the United States. The twentieth century saw many genocides stack up before there was ever a single person brought to account: Pol-Pot's Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, Hussein's use of chemical weapon's against the Kurds, Bosnia, Rwanda, Srebrenica, and Kosovo. The notion that the US could not intervene due to an inability to effect change, the possible risks, or the lack of political will are shown to be grossly inaccurate. Not only is there a moral imperative to face genocide up front but the facts tend to show that appeasing genocidal leaders only leads to more genocide. One genocide leads to another. The victimized populations lead to revenge and greater use of violence and become havens for terrorist organizations. I wish I could have read an updated version. Written over a decade ago, A Problem From Hell is still incredibly instructive and holds many lessons for future foreign policy in regards to genocide. Since the book was written, there has been the first warrant for a sitting Head-of-State, Omar al-Bashir in Darfur. ...more Ah, the book about genocide I've had sitting on my book shelf for 7 years!

The moral of the story: America usually does nothing because doing nothing is politically safer than doing something. No surprise here, but nice to see it laid out so clearly. I liked this book, but would not say that I \"really liked it,\" as 4 stars would indicate. I was quite interested in the learning about the details of the various genocides described\u2014Cambodia, Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia\u2014as I knew little about genocide beyond the WWII Holocaust. And for this purpose, the book was useful and interesting. However, I found that the structure of each chapter\u2014Warning, Recognition, Response (and their sub-sections)\u2014did a disservice to the storytelling, breaking up the flow of events, jumping around, and repeating many things. Overall, I found the book fairly repetitive (perhaps part of Ms. Power's point, oh well) and a bit tedious to get through, although I could see someone with a deeper interest in geopolitics finding it more engrossing. Overall, I am happy that I read this book, as I learned about some interesting, horrific moments in history, but I am also glad I am now done reading it. ...more If there was ever a book I would make required reading for all heads of state and government leaders, this would be that book. Despite making much-vaunted claims of 'never again' when speaking of the Holocaust, Power shows that America and the West has indeed allowed genocide to occur, over and over again - in Iraq, in Bosnia, in Cambodia, in Rwanda.

Only once has the West intervened to prevent genocide from occuring, in Kosovo, and then only largely because the world had already seen Milosevic commit genocide against the Muslims in Bosnia. She argues that America repeatedly refuses to intervene unless the situation becomes politically untenable in not doing so. If American interests are not threatened, America is not interested - despite its moral repugnance at the acts occuring. America repeats ducks its responsibilities by arguing that there is no consensus to act, no movement from its European allies, no pressure on the home front - but should a government with the power to prevent a genocide from taking place wait until its hand is forced by outside intervention? Power doesn't solely attribute blame to the U.S., but she is quite adamant that when a country positions itself as the leader of the free world, it is expected to, well, lead. And it's hard to argue with her, when this powerful, angry book shows time and again that American governmental officials have sat back and allowed genocide to happen. So much for 'never again'. ...more One piece of the picture: a bizarre and destructive mental state in which people are able to know, and at the same time not know, about something evil that is happening An example: Power describes an official in the United States government.

Karski reported that he saw, for example, the murder of pregnant women, and people forced to dig their own graves. The U.S. official said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. I do not mean that you are lying. I simply cannot believe you.\u201d (p. 34) A theologian called this \u201cthe twilight between knowing and not knowing.\u201d Similar but not quite the same as denial, just as dangerous. Power paraphrases the historian Walter Lacquer\u2019s description of this deranged but common mental state: \u201cmany people thought that the Jews were no longer alive, but did not necessarily believe they were dead.\u201d This is dark, important, human/inhuman stuff. Another powerfully written book on related horrors is We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed with our Families by Philip Gourevitch. When I was reading it, and mentioned it to friends, then explained what it was about, (the genocide in Rwanda), most of them said, \u201cWhy would you read a book like that?\u201d It\u2019s a long answer. ...more Fascinating, passionate, and damning in equal measure, A Problem from Hell is an indictment against the prevailing attitudes in the USA (and much of the west) towards genocide throughout the twentieth century.

As Power writes: \"No US President has ever made genocide prevention a priority, and no US President has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence that genocide rages on.\" She makes a very compelling moral argument as to why military intervention is sometimes necessary to ensure that lives are saved, and why the US should use its pre-eminent global position to bring about that intervention. I did, however, wonder why Power chose to focus on examples of genocide which placed Washington as a rather remote outsider, a quasi-isolationist, removed from complicity in the causes of genocide\u2014East Timor and Guatemala are two sad examples\u2014why not also look at the suffering American militarism and complicity have caused? ...more Is there anything more morbidly real than Genocide?

One problem is that it is impossible to enforce restrictions against genocide without weakening the sovereignty of nations, much in that same way that police involvement in spouse and child abuse undermines the autonomy of the family unit in society. Another problem is that there is a cost \u2014 in money, and ultimately blood \u2014 for any serious anti-genocide action. It's not as if the Germans quit murdering Jews because someone gave them a stern talking to. Genocide is one of those terrors that is intractable; like cancer, it is hard to diagnose, painful to fight, and sometimes simply impossible to beat. In the end eternity forgets us all, perversely lending a terrible freedom to each of our choices.

Just because they belong to the \"wrong nation\". There is so much hatred in the world today and it's so sad that human beings have to die every day because they were born with the wrong size, the wrong skin color, the wrong religion, in the wrong nation... and I still ask myself who decides what's wrong to take someone elses life?
