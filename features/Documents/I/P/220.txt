The people living there have either been brought there by force or have voluntarily gone there to start a new life. They are people with no roots in their new country, no family either. And in such a small space, Morrison manages to pack away so many stories, so many emotions. This was definitely a satisfying read and, as is always the case with Morrison, we are rewarded with poetic and perfectly crafted sentences. Morrison paints the New World as a place of hope, but also very different from the Old World: \u201cRight, he thought, looking at a sky vulgar with stars. Clear and right. The silver that glittered there was not at all unreachable. And that wide swath of cream pouring through the stars was his for the tasting.\u201d \u201cUnlike the English fogs he had known since he could walk, or those way north where he lived now, this one was sun fired, turning the world into thick, hot gold. Penetrating it was like struggling through a dream.\u201d What\u2019s common among the women in the story is that they are all victims. Regardless of colour or station, be they slave or free, they are reliant on men and their situation is precarious. They are in many ways pawns; their role in the New World is only slightly above cattle. How do people displaced from their homes try to come to terms with this separation? How do they try to save their cultures and traditions? \u201cRelying on memory and her own resources, she cobbled together neglected rites, merged Europe medicine with native, scripture with lore, and recalled or invented the hidden meaning of things. Found, in other words, a way to be in the world.\u201d Slavery is never easy to read about but this line was especially poignant to me: \u201cThe two men walked the row, inspecting. D\u2019Ortega identifying talents, weaknesses and possibilities, but silent about the scars, the wounds like misplaced veins tracing their skin.\u201d This book has a lot of sadness in it, then again Morrison\u2019s books are never cheerful. What I love about her chronicles is that she gives voices and feelings to people who are often ignored. Morrison always seems to adds a new layer of emotion to her characters. ...more Toni, Toni, Toni...it feels good to know you again.

The setting and subject is slavery in 17th century America, specifically Catholic Maryland. These are early days in the New World. Superstition was rife. Black magic and the devil were palpably real. With a bevy of glimpses Morrison displays most of the facets of slavery in this period, in this place. She does not forget that it was black Africans who kidnapped and sold black Africans to white Europeans, who sold them into slavery. She did not forget that white slavery existed in this time. She wrote about a people's strife without bended knee and bleeding heart, and yet your heart will bleed. Admittedly, I was turned off within the first few pages, because of the gypsy narration. I like permanence in my storytelling voice and this was very reminiscent of William Faulkner's The Sound and The Fury with its variant and confusing p.o.v.s and its scene setting via murky imagery. But I stuck with it, soon was enjoying A Mercy and in the end, came to love it. The writing is so strong, emotive and filled with vivid imagery. It is the kind of writing that inspires writers in their craft. This was a revisit to an old acquaintance for me. Not since college have I read a Toni Morrison novel. I loved it then, so why the delay? Why do we do that? When you only have one life - a single existence which could be snuffed out in an instance - why neglect the good things in life? Cherish what you have. It may be taken from you. Though we can only hope fate will be merciful. ...more Back in college I took a course on Colonial America because I had to. It was pretty tough for me to get into it at the time, since I never really gave a crap about that inaccessible and unglamorous period.

I wish this book had been around in those days, because Morrison's efforts to describe that bizarre and confusing world might've helped me get better picture of the time, and therefore care more about what I was learning. To me, A Mercy really is incredible historical fiction that provides access to a strange time and the people who lived in it. Morrison exposes the insides of her seventeenth-century characters in a way that made them sympathetic and comprehensible, though still remote and unfamiliar, even foreign. I didn't feel I could relate to these people at all, which for me was part of the point -- what do I have in common with someone living four hundred years ago? -- but also kept me feeling somewhat detached for the first two thirds of the novel. I enjoyed it, but I didn't really freak out about this book the way some other Booksters did until the last few chapters, which were totally fabulous and really did blow my mind. Recently on here there was some friendly (<---B>I think</---B>) bickering about Howard Zinn's People's History of the US and the whole question of multiculturalism and revisionist history. Although it's fiction, A Mercy is an almost perfect example of how I like my American history served: organic, unflinching, and successfully synthesizing, rather than just reacting against previous histories. In A Mercy, Morrison tears away the veil of idealism and whitewashing to stare unflinchingly at the myth of America, then unapologetically celebrates that very myth (it seemed to me), and it's pretty extraordinary. There's one passage in here about a character leaving the cramped, violent filth of Europe for the fresh, clean, virginal Eden of the New World, and it just gave me chills. I mean, it's really spectacular! She writes about all this slavery and sexual violence and persecution and disease in a way that lets you imagine what it was like to live in that era, and somehow, paradoxically, it makes the classic American myths -- especially the myth of freedom -- seem true for the first time, in a new way.... if that makes any sense. Morrison captures the complexity and brutality of Colonial America, cataloguing the various ways there were to be unfree (slavery, indentured servitude, marriage, etc.) through a multiethnic cast of characters who she's able to write as both weighty symbols and deeply human individuals in a way only Toni Morrison -- and almost no one else -- is able to get away with. The chapters are written from the perspectives of the various characters, in this unbelievable Morrisonesque language that will make you freak out. Yeah, this book probably will make you freak out.... Plus, it's super short! It's also a really interesting perspective on the legacy of American slavery, that recontextualizes it in a much earlier, more northern setting than most treatments, and gets into some different questions and issues than a lot of us are probably used to. Also, did I mention this lady can write? So yeah, in closing: I wasn't competely nuts about this, and especially at the beginning I had a couple weird moments where I almost felt like I was reading a trashy romance novel -- because of the subject matter, not the style -- but it was a good book, and I do recommend it. ...more This is a devastating look not only at the slave experience in the 17th century, but of various forms of bondage and of the place of women in that world. While skin color may have defined one sort of servitude, gender and class define others. Yet there are ways to find space between the bars.

While skin color may have defined one sort of servitude, gender and class define others. Yet there are ways to find space between the bars. Toni Morrison - from The Telegraph Set in the late 17th century, this is an ensemble story. Florens is a young, spirited slave girl. She speaks in the first person giving us a look from inside her skin. Except for one chapter by Florens\u2019 mother, the rest of the book is third person. We see Florens\u2019 experience with owners, families and yearnings old and new. Jakob is a kindly merchant/farmer, eager to help the unfortunate, always recalling his own humble, even desperate childhood. Rebekka is outwardly a free white woman, but truly was sold by her parents to be Jakob\u2019s wife no less than any black slave. Lina is the eldest of three helper women on Jakob\u2019s farm, a mother and friend to Rebekka. She is a Native American, a survivor of a small pox outbreak and the subsequent torching of her village. Sorrow is a black-toothed, somewhat addled woman who washed up on shore after a shipwreck. She holds conversations with an imaginary twin. Morrison also shows us two indentured servants. Despite having fixed terms to their indenture, their bosses find or concoct excuses to prolong their indebtedness and thus their servitude endlessly. the original seven years stretched to twenty-some, he said, and he had long ago forgotten most of the mischief that kept extending his bondage. One cannot but think of today\u2019s extension of tours of duty in the military. Religion comes in for a beating here. Religion, as Rebekka experienced if from her mother, was a flame fueled by a wondrous hatred. In one scene, Florens is suspected by a bizarre woman of being a witch and is forced to strip so she can be checked to see if she has a tail. Later, she attaches herself to a free black man in another form of devotion, only to have that work out badly. Lina had been taken in by a group of fundamentalists, who, unkindly, named her Messalina, seeing her as cursed by God. A curate is guilty of buggering a young boy. The 17th century is a cruel, harsh world \u2026it was clear in her household that execution was a festivity as exciting as a king\u2019s parade. Brawls, knifings and kidnaps were so common in the city of her birth that the warnings of slaughter in a new, unseen world were like threats of bad weather both in the old world and the new. Jakob offers a relatively safe place, a fenced-in peaceful community where orphans collect. But even with all the horror of the world we still define for ourselves who we are, maybe by paring crusted misery from our memory, maybe from holding some part of our true self separate from the harsh world. Solitude, regret and fury would have broken her had she not erased those six years preceding the death of the world. The company of other children, industrious mothers in beautiful jewelry, the majestic plan of life: when to vacate, to harvest, to burn, to hunt; ceremonies of death, birth and worship. She stored and sorted what she dared to recall and eliminated the rest, an activity that shaped her inside and out. By the time Mistress came, her self-invention was almost perfected. Soon it was irresistible. While maybe not the masterpiece that Beloved was, A Mercy is a very dense novel, a torte of a work, covering a range of subjects rich in significance, in language that is moving and penetrating. ...more I was enthralled with the incandescent prose and moving voices of four women in this tale set on a remote farm in colonial New York in the 1690s.

It was outstanding in the audiobook form read by the author, often sending chills up my spine with the vibrant power of its poetry. A major theme is how people harness love in all its forms and how they deal with the perception of betrayal. Another is the paradox of the foundation of the new world both on the hunger for freedom and on various forms of slavery (classic slavery, indentured servants, arranged marriage). The characters are wonderfully drawn. Rebekka is a \u201cmail order\u201d bride from England for a Dutch farmer turned trader, Jacob Vaart, whom she comes to loves dearly. Her household includes: Lina, a Native American orphaned from the decimation of her tribe by smallpox; Florens, a black slave girl whom Jacob reluctantly takes on as payment of a debt; and Sorrow, a mentally disturbed black slave who grew up on a ship of her slave trader father. Together they make a virtual family over the long intervals while Jacob is away. Rebekkah grieves over the loss of her children to disease and injury. She doesn\u2019t take to the judgmental forms of Christianity in the distant town. Instead she finds community with her workers at the farm. On the ship journey to America, she surprised herself by admiring the verve and parallel outlook of fellow women passengers headed for a life of prostitution in the new world: What excited and challenged her shipmates horrified the churched women and each set believed the other deeply, dangerously flawed. Although they had nothing in common with the views of each other, they had everything in common with one thing: the promise and threat of men. Here, they agreed, was where security and risk lay. And both had come to terms. Some, like Lina, who had experienced both deliverance and destruction at their hands, withdrew. Some, like Sorrow, who apparently was never coached by other females, became their play. Some like her shipmates fought them. Others, the pious, obeyed them. And a few, like herself, after a mutually loving relationship, became like children when the man was gone. The life Jacob brings her is so much freer than her life in London, but his travel to fulfill his ambition for an estate is a form of betrayal which leaves her in helpless loneliness: She learned the intricacy of loneliness: the horror of color, the roar of soundlessness, the menace of familiar objects lying still. \u2026 Silence would fall like snow floating around her head and shoulders, spreading outward to wind-driven yet quiet leaves, dangling cowbells, the whack of Lina\u2019s axe chopping firewood nearby. Her skin would flush, then chill. Sound would return eventually, but the loneliness might remain for days. Until, in the middle of it, he would ride up shouting. \u201cWhere\u2019s my star?\u201d \u201cHere in the north,\u201d she\u2019d reply and he would toss a bolt of calico at her feet or hand her a packet of needles. I was most interested in Lina, who is the most self-reliant of the women. Despite her losses, she has the strongest foundation owing to having had a loving mother and identity forged through her connections of her tribe. The betrayal she feels lies in the blind destructiveness of the immigrant invaders: Her people had built sheltering cities for a thousand years and, except for the deathfeet of the Europes, might have built them for a thousand more. As it turned out the sachem had been dead wrong. The Europes neither fled nor died out. \u2026 They would come with languages that sounded like dog bark; with a childish hunger for animal fur. They would forever fence land, ship whole trees to faraway countries, take any women for quick pleasure, ruin soil, befoul sacred places and worship a dull, unimaginative god. \u2026 Solitude would have crushed her had she not fallen into hermit skills and become one more thing that moved in the natural world. She cawed with birds, chatted with plants, spoke to squirrels, sang to the cow and opened her mouth to rain. The shame of having survived the destruction of her families shrank with her vow never to betray or abandon anyone she cherished. Sorrow is a strange bird with few skills to survive and an imaginary twin to ease her solitude. Having never known love, she is totally bowled over and obsessed with it when it happens to her, first with a free black man who periodically does blacksmith work for the farm and later with her child. The blacksmith betrays her by not committing to the relationship. The rapture of her love for him is portrayed so compellingly: The shine of water runs down your spine and I have shock at myself for wanting to lick there. I run away into the cowshed to stop this thing from happening inside me. Nothing stops it. There is only you. Nothing outside of you. My eyes not my stomach are the hungry pats of me. There will never be enough time to look how you move. Your arm goes up to strike iron. You drop to one knee. You bend. You stop to pour water first on the iron then down your throat. Before you know I am the world I am already kill by you. My mouth is open, my legs go softly and the heart is stretching to break. Florens comes off as the smartest of the women. She is the only one who can read, and she shows great courage and problem solving skills when tasked to make a long journey alone to get help from a herbalist when Jacob falls ill. Her mother made a sacrifice to give her up to Jacob instead of herself as a means of saving her from sexual assault by the master who owes Jacob money. Yet Florens is blind to that mercy and forever feels thrown away. The audiobook came with a helpful interview with Morrison added at the end. She eloquently explains some of her intentions in portraying the uncertain future for people living in the new world, the inventive ad-hoc nature of its social forms, and the prevalence of slavery independent of racism. I see this is the seventh book by Morrison I have had the pleasure of experiencing. I see also that I gave each one 4 stars. Enough of such niggling. Who am I to deny this one five stars when it resonates so long after reading it. ...more Toni Morrison\u2019s A Mercy is one of the most infuriating, lovely, haunted and haunting works I\u2019ve read in many a moon.

It is one of the few books I can remember that sent me back to read key passages and even whole chapters after I finished it to get clues to its maddeningly vague denouement and sample the blood-soaked, well-seeded soil of its prose one more time. I didn\u2019t reread anything in frustration, but in gratitude and admiration. A Mercy is set ostensibly in the late 17th century, a fact I didn\u2019t believe for a minute and yet strangely didn\u2019t bother me in the least. While the book lacks the heavy weight of multiple and minute details that grant the usual work of historical fiction verisimilitude, it also doesn\u2019t contain any howling anachronisms that hurl the reader out of the spell being cast. I feel more than a hard scrabble colonial era farm in an America barely shed of its birth caul, A Mercy is instead set in a place called \u2018Morrisonland\u2019, a gothic, sinister place suffused with lust, longing, confusions of identity and thwarted passions and improbable fates. It is a place that exists simultaneously only in the mind of its author and is a perfect representation of one aspect of America\u2019s fucked up soul. It is a pagan place, not a Christian one, full of dark ritual, demons and a sprit-infused geography that telegraphs well impending tragedy for those with eyes to see. As in all Morrison books, race is central, skin colors of all grades on display throughout in a mad dance of slavery, ownership, parent and discarded child, victim and potential killer. But Morrison is too canny and wise to write a book that is a straight up indictment of the huge festering wound that is the American subjugation of African and Native American people. Everyone wrestles with their own slavery in this book, whether it is to ideas of mercantile ascension and social respect, loveless marriage, or thralldom to a land that will break bones before it yields anything that offers anything remotely resembling sustenance. Morrison plants a few seeds of traditional romance within the narrative that point to the possibility of one character, the slave girl, Florens, escaping to a better fate via a freed African blacksmith and their intense physical relationship that develops. But once again Morrison is too true to her own darker gifts for any fairy tale ending where the princess is rescued and taken to some magic kingdom free of bitterness and strife. Instead, as in real life, a lesser fate and shadow identity is assumed where one that was hopefully headed for an upward trajectory is cast down utterly into blank confusion through her own befuddled mind and over-attachment to the lures of the body and a fantasy future that was always unlikely at best. It\u2019s a tough ending, one if written by anyone other than Morrison might sparks of racism and sexism but the hard ending is foreshadowed with great effectiveness and anyone expecting all to end well in this stretch fly infested swampland wasn\u2019t reading the text closely enough or else read too many Harlequins when they were younger. And while the ending is bitter and hard there are also grace notes of redemption, of life merely going on, of other wounded ones becoming \u2018Complete\u2019 that offer partial recompense for this harsh vision, making not wholly bleak, but tinged with small sweetness, like a flower bloomed in shadow. ...more \u0623\u0648\u0644\u064b\u0627 : \u0628\u0639\u064a\u062f\u064b\u0627 \u0639\u0646

The characters in By the end of this novel I felt as though I had finished reading a collection of character sketches that could be used to form a much larger and perhaps more coherent text. Each chapter skips around from one character to another, and from first to third person narration, which in itself is not a problem, and if done well can make an interesting and eclectic whole. In this case, the text simply became frustrating; a puzzle that is frankly not interesting enough to put together. The characters in this novel are diverse and could be very interesting if they were given the pages count they need. The characters consist of a Native American slave woman, a black slave woman who has a reputation of \"madness,\" a young black slave girl whose sale to another man was urged on by her own mother, a pair of white atheists (who seem nice at first, but are really like all other whites, bad), a freed young blacksmith, and two indentured men. We learn bits and pieces about each of these people, but never enough to truly care about them. The small histories we are given whet the appetite for more details that are never delivered. After reading Beloved one gets spoiled by the closeness that we can have with characters like Sethe, Denver, and Paul D, but in A Mercy it felt that the characters were being held away from the reader, forcing them to be impersonal. Even in Paradise a novel filled with dozens of characters, the individuals at least seemed more alive than those in Morrison's new text. Now for the Narrative. I simply do not know what to say as there is so little there. What is the point of the novel? Where do the characters end up? There is little development, and the heart of the story spans perhaps a few days with backlogs giving us a little information about how these people ended up where they are, but the sparse journey and the little history given do not add up to an interesting whole. Sorrow gives birth to a baby-girl and finds wholeness within that event, but we don't know her. The white woman Rebekka turns violent and cruel, but her betrayal means little because we hardly get to know the good in her which her cruelty is supposed to contrast. And yes, the young woman who was urged to be sold off by her mother is able to pick her sexual partner as her mother intended, but that freedom is so curtailed by the failure of her relationship and the reader's lack of personal connection with her that it barely matters. I wanted to love and adore this book as I do Beloved, but there is so little that the two books have in common. The utter intimacy that Morrison had to have developed with her characters in Beloved is not even attempted in this book. It is that distance that tears at my heart and makes me wonder if she will explore, and allow us readers to experience, that gut-wrenching sadness, anger, betrayal, again. ...more Yes, I am a Toni Morrison fan and believe she is incapable of writing a bad book, but that doesn't mean I wasn't ready to be critical of her new book if necessary. It's not necessary. The beginning may seem slow (that never bothers me) as we are thrust into a world that is faraway in time, but real.

Historical details never bog down; they are worn lightly, as a reviewer put it. Reviewers have compared one character here to Sethe from \"Beloved;\" and though I see the parallel, this is a very different book. Morrison never repeats a book: each is different from the others. Here the setting is the U.S. before it was the U.S. and slavery is presented in all its forms: black, white, natives, indentured Europeans, 'rescued' orphans, those who are needy, etc. Life is difficult, dangerous and arduous for all, yet there are some who manage to make connections to others despite everything. A slim book that contains multitudes. The sign of a great book for me: I paged back to the beginning as I neared the end (as I approached the ending, I couldn't put it down) and when I was finished, I could've read it all over again. I will one day. ...more I love Toni Morrison, the way she holds out the dark truths of Americas past and forces the reader to look and while the themes here are the same as much of her other work this one is a bit more raw, not the writing which is beautiful as always, but here she just lays it all out in plain sight, here it is motherfuckers, And oh man does she really give it to Christianity good for its part in the oppression of women, slave trade, all around evilness, etc, so you know I was into that and I probably I love Toni Morrison, the way she holds out the dark truths of Americas past and forces the reader to look and while the themes here are the same as much of her other work this one is a bit more raw, not the writing which is beautiful as always, but here she just lays it all out in plain sight, here it is motherfuckers, And oh man does she really give it to Christianity good for its part in the oppression of women, slave trade, all around evilness, etc, so you know I was into that and I probably should write a decent review for once, but fuck it, I'll just say Toni Morrison is a total badass and leave it at that, really, the amount of effort some of you put into your reviews, jesus christ. ...more From my youngest sister, who reads often and prefers \"Austenish\" lit: \"It was confusing and hard to get into and I didn't like the ending, but I did like that we heard every person's side of events.

I loved the ending- the last third of the book was great and really pulled together like strings twisting around and then forming a tight braid. Many similarities to \"Bluest Eye\".\" I would love to discuss this book with you if you choose to read it...I have a theory snowballing around in my head about what the turning point of the story concerning the slave girl Florens.If you still have the book, look at the part where Florens escapes the cabin with the white girl's help- I think there is a line or two where Florens asks her if she is taken with the devil and the girl smiles and says yes and then Florens feels a spirit or wind or something follow or watch her through the fence. That part is where I thought she fully embraced her darker self, and then from there on she was a primal being, intent on embracing a heady darkness she couldn't control. The indulgence of herself in herself- the selfishness of it all (the blacksmith addresses this) was breathtaking and sudden. My younger sister thought the boy was just hurt. I thought she might've killed him, and my middle sister wasn't sure- she thought maybe both boy and man were killed or none were killed. What do you think? ...more Dear Ms. Morrison: I just want you to know that I think you are a wonderful writer.

I chose your book because it was really short and I didn't want to put a lot of time into that assignment. I remember crying while reading it and wanting to take that little girl out of her miserable life and make her feel better about herself. When my son was a baby, I read Beloved and was equally horrified and sympathetic to Sethe's predicament. I loved the depth of emotion that book brought out in me. Later, I read Jazz and was so impressed by the way the language echoed the theme. The rhythm of your words was so, well, jazzy. I really, really wanted to give A Mercy more than three stars. I wanted to be blown away. I was looking forward to really feeling something, even if it didn't feel good. Unfortunately, the only things I felt were confusion and disappointment. It took me half of each chapter to figure out which character the chapter was about and what time frame the chapter was set in. It felt flat and pointless. I never got to really know any of the characters. Honestly, 167 pages is not enough to cover the number of characters and ideas this story is trying to convey. It's more like a draft than a finished novel. It's an epic story that's been condensed and abridged. I wanted to know more about these characters and the 17th century American colonies in which they lived. I liked that nobody was either a hero or a villain, but human. I just would have liked to know these humans better. Frankly, the reason I do give your book as many as three stars is that the prose is absolutely beautiful, as usual for you. The imagery and the rhythm is both poetic and musical. I just wish there had been more of it. Sincerely, Sandi K. ...more Maybe it's the bitter taste Beloved left me with; Maybe it's that she comes off as the poor woman's Maya Angelou; Maybe it's just that no matter how many how much I want to like her writing, I just can't.

Not only that, but the timeline from chapter to chapter was muddled. Add to that nausea the style of writing. While the narrative was meant to be abrupt and disjointed, it actually came across as a sophomoric attempt to show a world that the writer herself stereotyped. With all that said, I did enjoy the ending of the book; the bird's eye view into the lives of the cast as it were to unfold and the purity that it conveyed. Though it felt like it took blood, sweat, and tears just to get there. ...more No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No ...more \"You say I am wilderness. I am. Is that a tremble on your mouth, in your eye? Are you afraid? You should be.\" Written in different POV's Morrison's writing is intricate, detailed, and requires close reading to be able to understand. A neo-slave narrative, that's less about slavery itself and more about the real brutality during this time: that to lose ones origins, kinship, and family is to lose ones sense of self. This was definitely not one of my favorites. I am usually a die-hard Morrison fan, but this one just wasn't up to par with her earlier works. Many people have compared this to Beloved, but I find that comparison unjust. This book, while it had its moments of brilliance, was inundated with dense, incomprehensible prose. At times, I was unable to decipher who was speaking and when. It just wasn't a good read for me. \"\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u062e\u0641 \u0641\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0635\u064a\u0628\u0643 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u062a\u064a

disapppointing. It seemed as if Ms. Morrison wanted/had to crank out a book so did an \"abbreviated\" version of her usually phenomenal story-telling. the characters were 1/2 developed-almost but \"no cigar\" as was the story. Hey-Ms. Morrison has had an illustrious career-maybe next time??? I really hate to only give 2 stars to a Toni Morrison book. My main problem with A Mercy (the audio version) was with the narration. Morrison chose to read the book herself, and I'm not sure how well it worked. She reads so slowly and pauses in the middle of sentences so often, it started to feel like an attempted poetry reading. For example, \"Far away to the right (pause), beyond the iron fencings (pause), enclosing the property (pause) and softened by mist (pause), he saw Rosa Cortez, quiet (p I really hate to only give 2 stars to a Toni Morrison book.

Normally, I love to hear Morrison speak. I find her to be incredibly wise and articulate, and she is undoubtedly a gifted writer. I just found the pauses so distracting that it was hard to stay focused on the story itself. The book is interesting conceptually at least: a look at American slavery in the late 1600's, with multiple characters and relationships involving love, betrayal, and how a mother's choice to save her child from abuse is misunderstood and seen as abandonment. In the end, though, I couldn't get fully absorbed for the reason stated. This is another of those books I may have to revisit in the future when I can read the print version. ...more Before \"A Mercy\" came out, I had only read \"Beloved\", \"The Bluest Eyes\" maybe a year before.

So this isn't as overtly horrifying as other Morrison novels.

There's even a happy marriage! Up until the husband dies, anyway. Mostly, A Mercy seems like a book about people escaping the sort of horror Morrison puts her characters through. But see, this one creeps up on you. It's all sneaky and insidious. You finish it and you realize what it's suggesting, you trace the fullness of the story in all its gruesome implications, the cycle of abandonment and the well-intentioned deed gone wrong that kicks things off, and then it gets under your skin and the tragedy of it reveals itself to be enormous and you realize that escaping a life of miserable servitude is only the first step. It's all in a well-realized seventeenth-century America setting, with a string of rootless characters who all feel the scars and do what they can to survive. Like Morrison's been doing for a while now, the central story is pretty straightforward and is more the glue that holds everyone else's tales together, which creates this big spinning mega-story, this whole history of a whole family and their servants, that against all odds wraps up in under two hundred pages without feeling compromised.

Also surprising, the story seems to have taken place at the end of May/beginning of June--right now on today's calendar! And again, surprising, it seemed to take place in the colonies of Maryland and Virginia (where i grew up) although i confess some confusion about its precise location...the homestead that forms the locus of the story may have been located farther north, but i'm unsure (am i a bad reader?). All these things caused me to be even more absorbed in the story that I might have been had my family had its origins in 19th century Sicily or China, if today was in December on the calendar, or if i had grown up in Wyoming. Morrison has a gift with language and i loved every moment reading this story that peeled away from the center in a spiraling way, like peeling an apple in one long ribbon, to get back to the top where she'd started, and from where she could answer the question of why a mother would give her child away. ...more This story occurs in the late 1600s, during early days of slavery in America (that is, African people being used as slaves). By that time however, the tradition of using 'indentured servants' - essentially white slaves - was already well established. In this tale, several slaves work on a small farm run by Jacob and Rebekka Vaark: Native American Lina - whose tribe has been decimated by disease; black child Florens - who was given away by her mother; and jinxed Sorrow, who seems to bring bad luc This story occurs in the late 1600s, during early days of slavery in America (that is, African people being used as slaves). By that time however, the tradition of using 'indentured servants' - essentially white slaves - was already well established. In this tale, several slaves work on a small farm run by Jacob and Rebekka Vaark: Native American Lina - whose tribe has been decimated by disease; black child Florens - who was given away by her mother; and jinxed Sorrow, who seems to bring bad luck wherever she goes. As Jacob and Rebekka fall victim to smallpox the women - Lina, Florens, Sorrow, and Rebekka - each tells her tale in her own voice. We learn that Lina is a capable farmer who forged a friendship with Rebekka; that Florens yearns for affection and fell in love with a free African blacksmith; that uneducated Sorrow - who may be more clever than she seems - still can't fathom why she keeps getting pregnant; and that Rebekka traveled to America to marry a man she didn't know. Though the Vaarks are relatively kind masters the book touches on the evils of slavery and demonstrates the soul-deep damage caused by this practice. A well-written book with compelling and interesting characters. ...more I'd never read Morrison before. This was interesting, but the style is a bit confusing. I'm not sure I was able to keep track of all of the characters. I read this with my book club African American Historical Fiction . This is a very hard one to rate and review. I found this story to be dry, mundane, unfascinating, and probably lacking 100 or so pages. This story represented a time rarely discussed, the 1600s. Knowing that alone bored me before even opening the first page. I was extremely surprised to find that the characters in this story were extremely underdeveloped. Honestly I didn't care for or about any of them. But it's funny what happe I read this with my book club African American Historical Fiction . This is a very hard one to rate and review.

Knowing that alone bored me before even opening the first page. I was extremely surprised to find that the characters in this story were extremely underdeveloped. Honestly I didn't care for or about any of them. But it's funny what happens after your are finished with a book, meditate on it, discuss it and read interviews and other reviews on it. You sometimes get a whole new perspective...sort of an epiphany of the whole thing. I realized that the characters were not the main characters of this book. The themes of this story as well as the time and place is the fluid that kept the story moving. Therefore the themes became the characters. Morrison is a brilliant woman and for me to think that this story was as flat as I assumed was foolish of me. For me, this story represented self-worth, abandonment, perspective, dependency, and insight. It represented how sometimes things are not what they appear to be. Also, like Beloved, it represents how a person can form their own self-inflicted enslavement by not letting go of the past, giving another dominion over them. I don't know if I really have words that can really express what this books means (without giving any spoilers as I try not to do in my reviews). When I first finished this book I gave it 2 stars, then 3 and now four. But what I realized is that when deciding if you like a book or how to rate it you have to decide what it is you are wanting to accomplish from reading this book. Am I looking for good storytelling? Am I looking for general interest in the characters or storyline? What is the message in this story? What was the author trying to accomplish and did it work? What I am saying is sometimes a good book goes deeper than a good read. Sometimes it's about what you learned, what you took from it and how it effected you. I learned so much from this book, I took even more from it and this novel and it effected me almost as much as Beloved. What I have learned about Toni Morrison is that her stories aren't meant to be \"liked or disliked\". It's meant to teach, it's meant to make you think about everything you've ever believed in and question yourself as well as others as to your beliefs, morality and opinions? This book may not have been my favorite read or the best storytelling ever but what this book represents is purely amazing. p.s. For all the reviewers that keep comparing this to Beloved (which was an amazing book) stop doing that because you will be disappointed. It's not Beloved, the message and tone is totally different. You will only set yourself up for disappointment. This book stands alone. ...more \"poison is like the drowned, it always floats\"... consider this phrase from the novel and you will capture the primary emphasis of this book... what i mean by this is captured in the figures of jacob and florens...figures which represent the full spectrum of the slave relationship... with jacob, the slave owner, morrison depicts the notion that one cannot just sip lightly from a poisoned cup and avoid being poisoned...likewise one cannot merely dip one's toe into an economic system founded on slave \"poison is like the drowned, it always floats\"... consider this phrase from the novel and you will capture the primary emphasis of this book... what i mean by this is captured in the figures of jacob and florens...figures which represent the full spectrum of the slave relationship... with jacob, the slave owner, morrison depicts the notion that one cannot just sip lightly from a poisoned cup and avoid being poisoned...likewise one cannot merely dip one's toe into an economic system founded on slavery without being corrupted and intoxicated by it... another aspect of this lengthy dissociative metaphor is once the poison is introduced into a new environment it will float to the surface there as well... with florens, her slave status weighs on her so heavily she finds herself willing to go through hell, even to commit an act of horrible atrocity, in order to maintain an untainted connection that was formed outside the domain of her slaveness... in a sequence which symbolizes the poison that collects just beneath the surface of our contemporary culture to this very day, florens goes to the house that jacob built and scratches her story, her pain, her loss, into the walls, ceilings, and floors of one of the rooms... a slave, scratching her grief on the inside of the house the slaver built... there can be no more appropriate image for the unrest we experience today... morrison helps us to relieve that unrest, because she forces us to go inside that house and read those anguished words gouged into those surfaces... if enough of us go in there and read those words, maybe the poison will finally begin to dissipate... morrison seems intent on pointing out that, until we do, we still continue to poison ourselves... ...more This book just didn't do it for me. I had to read this for college and I find I usually enjoy books less when I'm forced to read them and critically engage but nevertheless I still didn't really like this book. For starters the book was so confusing. I actually had to google to see who was talking in the chapters. I can't stand not finding out who is talking until like halfway through their chapter (etc). The prose was also super vague and open-ended. And I believe it was done on purpose. I don' This book just didn't do it for me.

The prose was also super vague and open-ended. And I believe it was done on purpose. I don't know why Toni Morrison would write like that because it seriously took away from my enjoyment of the book. It also moved back and forward in time ( I think??) and it was hard to tell what was going on. The characters were interesting. I would have loved more open and deeper characters but what I got was like a very interesting look at one side of the characters while they had their chapter and a different side to them when other characters had their chapter. What made them so interesting was that you would see a side to a character x and you would think \"okay I like that character x\" and then character y would come along and tell you horrible stuff about character x. While the characters had their chapter, they usually made themselves look good but then another character would come along and tell you things differently so I didn't know what to think! The narration was very unreliable and I simultaneously liked and disliked that. The story itself was good. I thought it was brilliantly weaved but in my opinion the execution didn't work. I wouldn't recommend this book to other people. I would probably read another book by Toni Morrison though. ...more<---C>Toni Morrison</---C>", "Title": "A Mercy"},
