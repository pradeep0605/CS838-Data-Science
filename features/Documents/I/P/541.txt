Everything about The 5th Wave - an award winning male young adult author, a high octane alien invasion plot, the comparisons to Ender\u2019s Game and The Passage - made it seem like it\u2019d exactly my kind of book. But now that I\u2019ve finished, I\u2019m just so pissed with the whole thing I have nothing nice to say and really just want to punch something, and in fact, I dislike The 5th Wave so much I\u2019ve somehow written not one but three angry rants - yeah, be warned, this is going to be brutal(<---B>ly honest</---B>). Rant Number 1: The Alien Invasion is Beyond Disappointing The 5th Wave is not Ender\u2019s Game . The 5th Wave is not The Passage . The 5th Wave shouldn\u2019t even qualify as science fiction unless it\u2019s being mentioned in the same breath as Jennifer Armentrout\u2019s Lux series (even Stephenie Meyer\u2019s The Host is too good for this comparison). Why? Because there\u2019s just nothing here but a collection of alien invasion tropes leading to an actual plot that\u2019s all over the place, part cringe worthy young adult \u2018romance\u2019 (which I never would have expected outside of the usual suspects... but that\u2019s the topic of the next rant), part bizarre military training sequence (hence the unfounded comparisons to Ender\u2019s Game ... see rant number three), all leading to a nonsensical alien conspiracy by a group of \u2018Others\u2019, who, if they\u2019d really been studying us and planning our demise for as long as they claim, rather than the harebrained scheme they\u2019ve concocted to \u2018break\u2019 humanity, should\u2019ve just taken their cues from this awesome game: In fact, I\u2019ve seen my share of memorable alien invasion plots. Independence Day . Animorphs . V . Between Falling Skies , War of the Worlds , and Invasion America , Steven Spielberg has even done it three times. So at this point, count me unsurprised by the basic premise of The 5th Wave , but even so I still wasn\u2019t prepared for how derivative this book actually is *cough*infestation with obvious red herring*cough*. But don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not exactly looking for new and original - I just wanted something that, I don\u2019t know, isn\u2019t a clichefest? Any serious, well done treatment would have sufficed... and yet, I\u2019m wracking my head trying to think of anything else remotely this bad... and I just can\u2019t. There just isn\u2019t anything interesting about The 5th Wave that made me want to invest in the story - it\u2019s great that <---A>Rick Yancey</---A> seems to have latched on to Stephen Hawking\u2019s idea that if aliens ever visited, we\u2019d all be like the Native Americans during the colonial era, but the Waves themselves are just so generic compared to every other (imagined) alien attack that Cassie Sullivan\u2019s descriptions of the \u2018Other\u2019\u2019s invasion come across more like the melodramatic whining of someone too clueless and naive to appreciate the power of an alien invasion than the gritty recollections of a hardened survivor who\u2019s experienced the horrors of the attacks firsthand. Besides, there are only so many ways of describing how to squash a bug. Orbital bombardment. Biological warfare. A Fifth Column. Not only is The 5th Wave unoriginal, but it\u2019s excessive. I got it, humanity\u2019s beaten, there\u2019s really no need for all of Cassie\u2019s theatrics. Sure, she can pretend to be such a big expert on alien invasions, tell me how unprepared we are, how many people the \u2018Others\u2019 have killed, but she\u2019s so keen on sounding like the big expert she thinks she is she ends up being just so repetitive and ridiculously genre unsavvy. They can kill us? Yeah I know... I've seen them blow up the White House. Seriously, mope around too much bitching about it like she does, and it becomes a case of been there, done that, got boring, seriously stop telling me how terrible it is when I can imagine hundreds of worse scenarios. Face huggers anyone? Anyway, Earth being invaded by hostile, advanced aliens isn\u2019t new by any stretch of the imagination. But not only is The 5th Wave completely derivative of the many, many alien invasion plots of years past, it just has a terrible protagonist in Cassie Sullivan who forcefully shoves the same old regurgitated crap down my throat in the most inane way possible. Ugh. Rant Number 2: The \u2018Romance\u2019 is Beyond Terrible \"That\u2019s my big problem. That\u2019s it! Before the Arrival, guys like <---C>Evan Walker</---C> never looked twice at me, much less shot wild game for me and washed my hair. They never grabbed me by the back of the neck like the airbrushed model on his mother\u2019s paperback, abs a-clenching, pecs a-popping. My eyes have never been looked deeply into, or my chin raised to bring my lips within an inch of theirs.\" That, if you couldn\u2019t tell, is an actual quote from the book. In fact, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever read anything as romantically challenged as The 5th Wave , and this is including Twilight here (did I just compare Twilight favorably to another book?!!). Basically, I really really REALLY didn\u2019t like Cassie Sullivan as a character (again, and for completely different reasons than from rant number one). For one, I\u2019d be seriously concerned for any girl who responds to an impending alien invasion like this: It\u2019s the end of the world! OMG Ben Parish is hot! WTF? And as if that wasn\u2019t enough, Ben Parish isn\u2019t even the love interest. The real love interest is a poor guy named Evan Walker, who may or may not be one of them . Who, I\u2019m not kidding, tries to kill Cassie before growing a conscience and falling in love with her. And Cassie, of course, is the girl who\u2019s never been in a relationship before, so she immediately loses all sense of self preservation and melts into his warm brown eyes and dimple. What is this? The Host ? Did Stephenie Meyer write this? And if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, even if I weren\u2019t inwardly cringing every time Cassie and Evan appear together, Rick Yancey really should be banned from writing female points of view. This, again, is an actual Cassie quote: Time for the angrily-storming-out-of-the-room part of the argument, while the guy folds his arms over his manly chest and pouts. WTF? Should I believe what I think Yancey\u2019s saying about what girls think of guys? In fact, I would be laughing at how bad Cassie\u2019s point of view is if I weren\u2019t still smarting over the insipid alien invasion plot that made me want to fling my copy of the book across the room (not that I can, don\u2019t want to pay for repairs to the drywall). Double ugh. Rant Number 3: The Comparisons to the Sci-fi Classics are Completely Unfounded The days when alien invasion plots could stand solely on the invasion ended right around the time of H.G. Well\u2019s War of the Worlds . Somebody, unfortunately, didn\u2019t get the memo. Since then, alien invasions have been pushing the boundaries of speculative fiction by exploring the paranoia surrounding sleeper agents ( Invasion of the Body Snatchers ), adult authority and its limits ( Ender\u2019s Game ), and discovering the truth in the face of a complex government cover-up ( The X Files ), but although The 5th Wave borrows elements from all of these other alien invasion plots, I can\u2019t for the life of me point to one alien invasion theme that this book does well. Evan being a human-alien hybrid struggling to reconcile his alien soul with his humanity? Shallow even in comparison to The Host . The conspiracy surrounding the \u2018Other\u2019\u2019s infiltration of the US military? So transparent I wouldn\u2019t even call it a conspiracy. Ben\u2019s military training to take out the infested? Is that a joke? They even killed (an expendable character named) Kenny! Cassie\u2019s struggle to survive the Waves, eventually learning to become a tougher person? Ok, that one\u2019s done well, I\u2019ll admit, until she runs into Evan and becomes a quivering mess of a character. Then, yuck! Look, I\u2019m not against borrowing plot elements from other sources. But when those elements mean something, when there\u2019s a theme behind them, I don\u2019t want to see a shallow treatment that does neither the source nor the adaptation any favors. And for The 5th Wave , that\u2019s unfortunately the case. Triple ugh. Basically, The 5th Wave is, in every way, an embarrassment to science fiction. Rick Yancey tried to work too many different concepts into this book, jumping all over the place, that the end result is not one of them is done well. I\u2019m muy disappointed. ...more \u201cIf aliens ever visit us, I think the outcome would be much as when Christopher Columbus first landed in America, which didn't turn out very well for the Native Americans.\u201d - Stephen Hawking Sometimes, I am lucky enough to get my hands on an ARC of a book and go into it with as close to no expectations as possible.

I haven't read any reviews before, so the first experience is entirely my own, as I find it. And sometimes I love these books. Sometimes I give them 4 or 5 star reviews, rated purely based on the emotional high I experienced. I am an emotional reader and an emotional rater afterall. Sometimes these books get read by a few people and disappear, and sometimes they take off and become huge, gaining ever more praise and criticism. It is this latter experience that always has a strange effect on me. Because, when I read The 5th Wave , I enjoyed it immensely. Enough, even, to write a song, with my sister, inspired by it . I thought it was atmospheric and perfectly creepy. I could sense the distrust and fear in the air. But later, after time had passed and the immediate emotional effect had waned, I was reading the negative reviews and felt somewhat... embarrassed by my part in the hype. Was it really that good ? To deserve all this hype? Is any book ever that good ? Should I have been more critical? Should I be embarrassed by my gushy, bright-eyed emotional response? I feel this way about so many books that I rave about early and that become huge later. An Ember in the Ashes is another good example. People say they don't understand the hype, that The 5th Wave doesn't even deserve to be classed as science-fiction, that it is - literally - \"the worst book I have ever read\". And I find myself, post-emotional response, agreeing to many things said. Is The 5th Wave really that original? I guess not. Is it so mind-blowing that it deserved all that gushy praise I gave it? Maybe it wasn't. Look at it for what it is and can you honestly say it's that good ? Probably not. And yet, I read it again, knowing what I did not know the first time around. I read it and I once again felt that atmosphere of loneliness, sadness and distrust. It's not a logical thing and it might not make sense to a lot of people, but it pulls me so entirely inside this book. Maybe emotional responses don't hold up under a critical eye. Maybe this book doesn't objectively deserve the praise I heap upon it. All I know is that for a little while, this book took me completely out of this world and affected me enough that I wanted to gush and praise and write a song. I won't offer promises of originality or great science-fiction. I'll just stand as an example of someone who read this book in 2013 and again now and, for whatever reason, loved it.

What I really liked about this book was the style of writing.It was unique and very well planned.I must say I was lost on some parts because the book is written is a lot of points of views.There were some moments that I didn't know who was narrating but I got used to it after I learned more about the characters. The story is what kept me reading this book more and more.It never gets boring.Believe me I was thrilled and excited in every single paragraph. It's so well written. The story : The book is about a girl called Cassie who survived 4 waves of aliens.The first wave shut down the electricity and killed about half million people.The second wave \"The red Tsunami\" killed more and more.The third one killed 97% of humans and the 4th wave whipped the trust out of people.Now Cassie is alone in a journey to save her little brother.In her adventure she meets a boy called Evan who mixes her thoughts and now she has to decide if she can trust him or not.If she breaks or not the first rule of surviving \"TO SURVIVE YOU HAVE TO STAND ALONE\" The characters : Cassie Cassie is one of those characters you can't help but like.She is determinated to do what she thinks is right.She is also selfless.Not for a second she thinks about her safety.She is also caring and good at heart.What I really liked about her was her kickass mood.She is trained in karate and she doesn't hesitate to show her skills. Evan : I must admit the bro got moves.Seriously he is like a lady master and I want him to give me lesson on that area.He is also calm all the time and I don't remember a single panic word slip from him. Ben : Ben is one of those characters we are used to.He is a much of a soldier.Smart,tactics,strong,and the most important he keeps promises that he makes. Me while reading the book ( favorite sentences ) : \u201cBut if I'm it, the last of my kind, the last page of human history, like hell I'm going to let the story end this way. I may be the last one, but I am the one still standing. I am the one turning to face the faceless hunter in the woods on an abandoned highway. I am the one not running but facing. Because if I am the last one, then I am humanity.

If that's true, I'm in trouble: It's my normal mode of communication.\u201d \u201cI am a shark, Cassie,\" he says slowly, drawing the words out, as if he might be speaking to me for the last time.

Quick, grab the beer!\u201d \u201cI took one look at it and demanded that he name three things he isn't good at. \"Roller skating, singing, and talking to girls.\" \"You left out stalking,\" I told him as he helped me out of the bed. \"I can always tell when you're lurking around corners.\" \"You only asked for three.\u201d \u201cIs this how humanity waves good-bye?

is the only way to stay alive to stay alone? yancey introduces this nicely, and does a good job carrying and developing this theme throughout the book. and that's about all i can praise. the love-story elements were particularly baffling. again, this might be my own personal blind-spot. i never really pay much attention to these portions of books, especially in YA novels. they rarely strike me as interesting or realistic - i usually just write them off as something that YA books seem to be contractually obligated to include, because it is expected of them - you need a love triangle, because you need something to set off the tension in the other parts of the story. i usually kind of gloss them as i am reading, with the exceptions of Graceling , On the Jellicoe Road , and pretty much anything Laini Taylor has written. those examples, i feel, successfully incorporated the romance angle into the larger work. but usually, they just seem like perfect-people wish-fulfillment, and are either too melodramatic and silly or too contrived. this one was something else. this one was a little creepy, and i don't understand why it warms the hearts of others. evan is a weird stalker type, hovering behind closed doors while cassie is sleeping, reading her diary, undressing her while she is unconscious, washing her hair like that dude in that x-files episode. and obviously he has his reasons, but the fact that she keeps catching him in his various lies and is conflicted between not trusting him but still needing him, and genuinely having feelings for him, for me, creates the wrong kind of tension and doesn't ring true, not from someone who supposedly already has trust issues and has killed men for less. i do understand the \"any port in a storm\" mentality, so i am willing to give this a pass, but since it makes up so much of the story, it kind of casts its shadow wide over my appreciation for the book. moving onto secrets, twists and turns. again, genuine bafflement that people are praising these in the book, which practically broadcasts its surprises every single time. in a book that frequently mentions chess, you would think it would mask its moves a little better. 1) consider POV, just for one second, and the (view spoiler) [evan-surprise is completely defused after his first chapter with cassie (hide spoiler) ] 2) never, ever trust a milgram test. you see that, and the jig is up for your twist. 3) in a book that so frequently tells you \"trust no one,\" the reader is going to trust no one. so any twist that comes outta that loses its impact. the only good moment that comes in the form of a twist is the scene with ringer and zombie in the war zone. you know which one i mean. or maybe you don't. not the part where (view spoiler) [ they realize they have been fighting on the wrong side, because - duh - but just the reveal once ringer removes her tracking device and starts to glow. (hide spoiler) ] that scene was very well-done. children and teens being trained as soldiers to fight the enemy, no matter who that enemy is, makes no sense except within the confines of a YA novel, where the audience is presumably the same age as the characters, so it becomes an empathetic experience. there is no convincing reason to not use adults in this capacity. seven-year-olds are not going to win your war for you. there is also too much repetition in this book. there was a passage i liked: I might be - no, I probably am - doomed. But if I'm it, the last of my kind, the last page of human history, like hell I'm going to let the story end this way. I may be the last one, but I am the one still standing. I am the one turning to face the faceless hunter in the woods on an abandoned highway. I am the one not running, not staying, but facing. Because if I am the last one, then I am humanity. And if this is humanity's last war, then I am the battlefield. which is pretty cool. i like that as a battle cry. but then, in the very next chapter, the coolness is undermined by the repetition of this mantra, in the contrast with another character: \"You are the human clay,\" Vosch whispers fiercely in my ear. \"And I am Michelangelo. I am the master builder, and you will be my masterpiece.\" Pale blue fire in his eyes, burning to the bottom of my soul. \"God doesn't call the equipped, son. God equips the called. And you have been called.\" He leaves me with a promise. The words burn so hot in my mind, the promise follows me into the deepest hours of the night and into the days that follow. I will teach you to love death. I will empty you of grief and guilt and self-pity and fill you up with hate and cunning and the spirit of vengeance. I will make my final stand here, Benjamin Thomas Parrish. Slapping my chest over and over until my skin burns, my heart on fire. And you will be my battlefield. which is probably something that people like - the turning of the one situation on the other, but there are just too many instances like this in the book - too many convenient echoes and repetitions and breathless realizations of what the fifth wave is. it made the characters less like humans and more like symbols. or chess pieces, to extend the metaphor. and this was a problem, for me. i never felt like the characters were realistic, or made believable choices. if this was supposed to be a representation of what remains of humanity, it kind of stinks to know that this is what we are left with. the frustrating part is that both cassie and ben have moments of interesting insight, but then continue to act like cardboard people the rest of the time. and ringer is complete hot tough-girl fantasy material. which is a real letdown, because that character could have been so freaking cool. and i was really looking forward to this, and it genuinely makes me sad to have such a lukewarm reaction. it is the same reaction i had to his book The Monstrumologist , which again, everyone seems to like. this is me and magic eye puzzles all over again. i wish i could see what you all see.

Out of everything I've read( which is like half of the book), the only part I liked was the prologue, which is sad, 'cause it's only 1 page long on my ebook. After that, it all went downhill. The characters. I did NOT care about any of the characters. Cassie's basically this really annoying girl who talks and thinks weird. I think Yancey tried too hard to make her seem like a tough girl. But in truth, she has no depth at all. Sammy, her brother is just a 5 year old kid who, really, knows nothing about the world. So I really don't get the point of writing from his POV. Evan, the love interest, is also a character with no depth, but a lot worse than Cassie. Basically he's just your average \"nice\" guy with no personality. AT ALL. He has no emotion. Nothing. It's like he's some kind of robot... (view spoiler) [ I know he's an alien. But aliens do have feelings, I guess? Read the Silencer chapter. It's him in alien form. If I'm not mistaken. (hide spoiler) ] Ben, another future love interest(?), is such a boring character that he's as bad as Cassie. Maybe that's why Cassie likes him? They're both boring as fuck? I don't get the point of the romance. It's just so random...Cassie's like \"I hate you\" one minute and the next, they're kissing each other!! What the fuck is this?! It's soo pointless and I'd rather not read a long and awful chapter about them living together and this shitty romance. My biggest problem is the writing. The writing is awful . I've never read any book with such shitty writing. It's like a really awkward toned down version of This is Not a Test . Seriously. The writing is what made me hate this book so much. It's like Yancey's trying to imitate the intense writing of This is Not a Test and failed. Badly. The writing bored me from the beginning, it's just so..bland and frustrating, I really wanted to throw this book out of the window (which is impossible, 'cause it means my phone will break with it and I wouldn't want that.). \u201cI brought Sammy inside and put him to bed. Said his prayer with him. \u201c\u2018Now I lay me down to sleep\u2026\u2019\u201d To me, just random noise. Gibberish. I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what it was, but I felt that, when it came to God, there was a broken promise in there somewhere.\u201d What the fuck is that?! \"After feeding me, he changes the dressing on my leg. I ask if I want to look. He says no, I most definitely do not want to look. I want to get out of bed, take a real bath. He says it's too soon...he sets a kitchen chair in the middle of the claw-foot tub in the little bathroom down the hall with its peeling flowery wallpaper and carries me to it, plops me down, leaves, and comes back with a big metal tub filled with steaming water.\" Get my point? The plot. I can hereby tell you that nothing happens in this book till the point I've read (which is around halfway). (view spoiler) [ The flashbacks counts as nothing, 'cause they're flashbacks (hide spoiler) ] Plus, it's pretty much a rip-off of The Host . And even me, someone who only watched the movie, can tell. The change of POV. Gosh, this frustrated me soo much, it's as bad as the writing. So basically, the book never tells you whose POV you're reading from. There was this part named \"Wonderland\" and in the beginning he says something like \"My name is Zombie\" or whatever. AND THEN, at the end of \"Wonderland\" he just kind of mentioned that he was actually \"Benjamin Thomas Parish\" and I was like WTF?! So this whole time I'm supposedly reading a POV from Cassie's crush? This is soo confusing! Oh and this is the beginning of Sam's POV: \"Cassie, through the smudged window, shrinking. Cassie, on the road, holding Bear.\" blah blah blah Get what I'm saying? We have to figure out whose POV we're reading by ourselves. Huh. Bad idea, Yancey. So , this is my mini rant and the things I hated about this book. It didn't turn out as angry as I thought it would. I really don't want to waste my time typing out a review 'cause it's really not worth it and finals is coming up, so this is like a tiny version of it. Just know that I'm not reading any book of Yancey's EVER AGAIN. No star for you, you awful book. By the way, if you really want to read a proper review, there are loads of well-written ones out there. :) ...more SO GOOD. Loved the writing style, loved the lead characters, full of twists, and wonderfully paced.

The 4th Wave : Disappointment (This is not getting any better) The 5th Wave : Annoyance (Just end already) Then why am I even giving it 2 stars?? Because my hatred for this book does not translate into this being a bad book. Some of the best reviewers on GR have loved The Fifth Wave and I totally respect their opinions. I guess this was simply not for me. I'll start with the thing that annoyed me the most: The Writing This is probably a me-thing, but I found the writing extremely irritating. Not necessarily terrible, just...irritating. There were 2 aspects that especially got on my nerves. #1: Unnecessary details \"This could be it,\u201d Lizbeth whispered. She rubbed her nose nervously. Dug her lacquered nails into her dyed blond hair. Tapped her foot. Rolled the pad of her finger over her eyelid: She had just started wearing contacts and they bugged her constantly.\" Seriously?? Pray tell me, WHY are we talking about lacquered nails and contacts when there are bigger things to talk about?? like aliens ?? And you know, this Lizbeth girl, she's not even there in the book. Her collective appearance spans 3 measly pages so I don't know what purpose that paragraph serves :-/ #2: Unnecessary Repetition I hate it when writers keep repeating words in a sentence, or clauses in a paragraph. It may work in poetry but otherwise, it's just plain annoying. \"So of course he did the most reasonable thing. He was a responsible adult, and that\u2019s what responsible adults do. The reasonable thing.\" \"The stars above, bright and cold, and the dark road below, and the humming of the wheels on the dark road beneath the cold stars.\" \"There are the stars, the pinpricks of light stabbing down. There is the empty road beneath the light stabbing down and the girl on the road with the smudged face and twigs and dead leaves entangled in her short, curly hair, clutching a battered old teddy bear, on the empty road, beneath the stars stabbing down.\" Now the love-story - it was a massive fail . Stupid Cassie falls for Creepy Evan - and then things quickly turn into a retelling of The Host . I didn't find anything remotely romantic about the whole Evan thing. (view spoiler) [Okay, so he saved your life and nursed you back to health. But he also bathed you when you were passed out. How does that not creep you out, Cassie?? HOW?? (hide spoiler) ] The writing makes sure that we're constantly reminded of Evan's chocolate-brown puppy-dog eyes and hands soft like clouds (barf). The final thing that made me lose it - the cliches . The alien apocalypse happens and the human race is nearly wiped out. There are hardly any families left BUT Cassie survives, and so does her brother and her father (view spoiler) [He dies later, but still (hide spoiler) ] . And of course, her high-school crush also survives - how else will you have a love triangle in the sequel?? (view spoiler) [ I think Evan's making a comeback in book 2 (hide spoiler) ] So what if he never noticed Cassie before?? Now he can, since the competition is dead. You wanna know the saddest part?? This was my first book about aliens. And there weren't any aliens. At least not the kind I was looking forward too :( There was some action towards the end but I was way past the point of caring by then. Verdict: MASSIVE LETDOWN . I need some uplifting chocolate therapy.

It will be hard for you to pick your favourite, because they\u2019ll all worth your attention. What\u2019s wonderful is that this book really does have a little bit of everything. First, it\u2019s science fiction, which you probably already know, but it\u2019s doesn\u2019t only touches on the subject of aliens invading the Earth. No. The characters have their own conflict above the war for territorial acquisition happening. They\u2019ve lost their family. They fell in love with the wrong person. They became someone else: they lost themselves. They try to keep on living when there\u2019s nothing to live for. I liked the deepness of themes and how it challenged us as readers. How do you rid the Earth of Humans? Rid the humans of their humanity. Cassie, Evan, Zombie and all the other characters are trying to find solace in something. Thus, it is to be expected and definitely normal for there to be a lot of rumination going on in their minds. Yes, there\u2019s enough action to satisfy you but please don\u2019t expect a ubiquitous amount of it, for you\u2019ll find this book rather slow and will be deeply disappointed by it. The pacing varies; it\u2019ll be slow for fifty pages and then pick up in speed, and vice versa. I truly didn\u2019t mind it, because the characters\u2019 voices are so present and distinguishable; it never made me fall into boredom. One more thing: everything is not what it seems. I may be the last one, but I am the last one still standing. I am the one turning to face the faceless hunter in the woods or an abandoned highway. I am the one not running, not staying, but facing. Because if I am the last one, then I am humanity. And if this is humanity\u2019s last war, then I am the battlefield. ...more 1/24/16 Movie Update: I finally saw it... Mixed feelings. Like many of you commented, I think the weakest parts were the romance. I hated how the last 1/4 of movie seemed rushed compared to the book -and my big pet peeve was that Ben recognized her and knew who her brother was ( soooooo not how it happened in the book) and that when Ben and Evan finally met it was not awkward & hilarious (because of Cassie's lies and obsessions) like the book.

To me, one of the greatest things about the book was the running joke with her obsessions & lies about Ben and the movie did not play those up. Also, the eye. They made it look so easy for her to escape, grrrr! The whole last 1/4 of the movie was ridiculous. But I did love who they casted for Ben and Cassie (it's not her fault they kept making her fall in the script) and Nugget and Ringer... wow, flash backs to Johanna (sp? Hunger Games). I remember rooting a bit for Ringer-Ben in the books but since Cassie was the MC I wanted it to be her with Ben more. The movie Evan was way hotter than the alien in my head, thank gawd, and his acting was good, but I still cannot root for them at all. My overall movie vs. book impression? Book kicks ass, but the movie was not terrible like how I felt about City of Bones (and how they ruined Jace & Clary's script). Watching the movie reminded me I need to read the second book soon. It was okay, I guess like everyone said it just played up the romance that made me cringe in the books. Overall though? Not bad. Buddy read with Nenia's whose lovely review you can read HERE , she and I both had a very different take on this book but her portrayal of Cassie/Evan is freaking PERFECT (and hilarious) ^-^ My review in few words: I loved this book but not Evan. Freaking loved everything else to death -the action, the POV's, the narrative, and especially Zombie/Ben. The book went downhill a bit when Cassie/Evan got all Twilight-y (you know what scenes I'm talking about if you've read this) but towards the end I did like them together, only I want Cassie to end up with Ben (come on! all the priceless jokes about her childhood infatuation, it would be so good!) but I know that won't happen:/ ...more Now THIS is how you write a book, ladies and gentleman!

With the slew of dystopian and post apocalyptic novels coming out you can only imagine how refreshing it is to stumble upon a truly refreshing, incredibly well created novel about an alien apocalypse. And don't let this term fool you, aliens may not be running rampant on our planet (yet), but Yancey has succeeded in making this event just as realistic as any other world disaster. Plus, in my opinion I think it's a little naive to believe we're the only life form with intelligence in the universe. Could this happen to us? Absolutely! I believe it! Told via multiple perspectives, this novel begins with the introduction of our main character; Cassie. With a lot of luck, sure, but bravery and purpose is what keeps her alive when it really matters. And truly, what are we without purpose? This girl is one I would want by my side if a future like this ever came to fruition. She's one of those heroines that you positively want to root for, with a fierce determination mirroring the likes of Katniss (THG) and Katsa (Graceling). The first part of the novel explores her time with her family--or what's left of it. There is some powerful writing that went into this story, and not just with creating the plot which I'll go into in a bit, but in the emotional consequences of this situation, as well. Families have been literally torn apart in some of the cruelest of ways, Cassie is lucky to have what she has and this bond is so powerfully gripping it had me longing for a little brother I never even had. The other POVs are just as distinct with just as much emotional investment; I was found easily hooked into to their every word brought about through a seamless transition. As I enjoyed being surprised by who the other perspectives were I won't spoil it for you, I will just say that I found the choices to be a great way to direct the story. These aliens have not gone easy on humans. As the book title conveys, there have been 4 waves of shock and terror thrown our way, each one rousing up your fear for what the 5th wave is going to be. There is one primal fear that is investigated throughout this novel which is the fear of being truly alone. When the enemy takes the face of should-be allies, how can you trust anyone at all? How does humanity survive? A poor guy with a gunshot wound who only wants help might just be a trap. Anyone you could ask for help yourself might be the last person you'll ever see. Together, humans can fight back, separated by mistrust, humans become their own enemy. This is one of the most crucial aspects of this book, it's what makes it so upsetting and desperate. Like Cassie, the reader is not able to let themselves trust anybody at all, not to mention garner any hope. Yes it's a very dark, very despairing read. Together with this apprehension, the harsh realness of the plot makes it such an intensely compelling read. The creation of the alien invitation is done without fail. If there is a plot hole in here I did not perceive it. Yancey imagined every leg of this race and he ran with it. I am wholly impressed with its complexity, one that didn't feel complex, really, just elaborated, or sensical. I have not read a book in this genre that had me so thoroughly--and I mean entirely --caught up in it since The Hunger Games and Ashfall--and I do not say this lightly. I'm in no way comparing the books themselves, just their engrossing factor; they're all consuming from head to foot and every single pounding heart beat and every clenched muscle, and that is so very rare--at least for me. This book, it's a ticking time bomb, and you feel it with each fiber of your being! Then we come to the ending, and this time bomb of a book counts down into a frenzy until you can hardly stand it. I devoured it. Every single page I devoured greedily and if I had to pick a book to re-read for ever and always this one would be in the top running (with a very fair chance)!

In fact this whole thing is so much of a cliche, that I was compelled to check the copyright page of the book to make sure it wasn't some packaged deal thrown together by a group of people to hit every popular plot point (like Partials and Unraveling ), but no, Yancey wrote it all by himself, apparently, and it's not good. In my opinion, of course. I don't want to disregard the feelings of all my friends who did like it. I might have read a bit too much SF and YA to enjoy this. ...more Pss! Pss! I have a theory. Want to hear it? I'm starting to think that Rick Yancey is a genius. What does a genius do, you're asking? He makes people think they are the genius, by creating a story so predictable that every reader will feel so fucking clever. No, no, this is not sarcasm (not entirely, anyway). See, I was here bitching about how I guessed everything - every fucking thing apart from the ear teddy bear rumpled (come on, I'm not that great) - when I realized that there was no way I wa Pss!

See, I was here bitching about how I guessed everything - every fucking thing apart from the ear teddy bear rumpled (come on, I'm not that great) - when I realized that there was no way I wasn't meant to. NO WAY. The clues are EVERYWHERE. All along. So what does it leave us? If the shock factor is close to none, what does it freaking leave us? \u25ba That leaves us with characters that confused the hell out of me - not because of what they do (yet don't think I forgot you, Evan. You became more interesting but you're still a creeeeeeep) - but more because of my reactions to them. I can't decide if I didn't care about them or liked them or was annoyed by them. All of the above, probably. Except Nugget. I'll always love you, Nugget. I'll even forgive you for not really sounding like a 5 years old . I'm Team Nugget . Woot! Anyway - what was I saying - oh, yes, my complete inability to know what I thought of the characters when I was reading. Here's my little opinion, in the end : \u2718 Cassie - Likeable and relatable. I don't care about her flaws, her mistakes - I get her. \u2718 Zombie - This is true what they say about first impression. Don't trust them (or is it the opposite? I can never remember) - The fact is, I lost my interest in its parts pretty fast. One word : bland. And riffles. Way too much riffles. Okay, okay, I'm not fair. I just don't like him. He bores me. Booh. Also, (view spoiler) [when someone asks you if you remember something with loads of details, you just don't shrug and say no. That's just rude XD. (hide spoiler) ] \u2718 Ringer - Who? \u2718 Evan - Awww, here's our little creeper! Everybody waves to Evan! Helloooooo Evan!! No, but really guy. This is not okay to lurk. This is not okay to kiss someone who tells no (even if *because it's a book* she changes her mind in a heartbeat. I HATE THAT SHIT. PLEASE DON'T). You sure don't blow the candle and kiss her anyway. Who does that?! Oh, yes. A fucking psycho. Yes, even if you're in looooooove. By the way, don't act all righteous about it. It's called instalove and that's pretty common over there. *waves to Edward* I'll give you this, though, your last parts were pretty great. You still stay an obsessive psycho to me. Here's me slapping you behind the head *ow! That shit hurts!* \u25ba What was my biggest problem? Well, that would be the boredom . Looking back, I think that Rick Yancey 's writing didn't do it for me. Oh, yeah, some parts were amazing and I have tons of quotes because the guy is pretty quotable. There's that. Yet I can't count how many times I felt bored to death only to end thinking after, hey, that was pretty cool . That's why I think I liked more the idea of the book than the book itself. I love how the story makes us think about what it really means to be human. Is that what we do? Is that how we look? Would we be able to decipher whether we're right or wrong? I don't think so. That woke up my interest. Too bad it was drowned into my boredom. I should point, though, that some parts engrossed me - mostly Nugget's POV, but also Cassie-pre Evan POV . What a rambling girl I am. Sigh. I'll organize my review better. I PROMISE. (well except if aliens come and all, in that case I don't promise. Sometimes we just can't, remember?) Oh, now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure that I'm safe in France. I mean, who the hell cares about France? Aliens always go to the US anyway. Sorry guys.

What did bug me was their similar backstories, everyone had dead parents,ensuring the orphan story and usually, a younger sibling dead. This book definitely captured my attention,a true page-turner as I finished the book in three days. The writing style was pleasant with some brilliant, memorable lines. The story pulls you in from the start and takes some fantastic turns with some difficult situations which made me ask myself What would I do?

They even had promo posts on the subway. The quotes were really interesting and the thing about a strong heroine in an alien invaded earth, how can it be that bad? And then we can add the alien-earth romance to have the spicy in the food. Well, it was promising enough. It should have been. The writing in this book is really beautiful. It was beautiful, funny and direct. It has great quotes that makes you think about life and how small we are in the universe. Also, how ridiculous we can be with capitalism. How people think that they are better than others because they have more money but after death, they are just the same. By killing us, they showed us the idiocy of stuff. The guy who owned this BMW? He\u2019s in the same place as the woman who owned that Kia. I usually like books with a lot of POVs. This one has it, a lot. The narration is captivating. There are action everywhere and I love when I have this hunger to know what will happen next. However, the hunger wasn't really present while I was reading this book. As it starts between 4th wave and 5th wave, Cassie (One of the POVs) use flashbacks to tell us what happened in the others waves and how she ended where she was. So everything wasn't surprising because we new how it would end. Also, between the flashbacks we had some what-is-happening-now narrative. So it was kinda confusing. Past-present-past-present-past-oh-wait,-I'm bleeding-now-in-the-present. A lot was happening and nothing was happening. A lot happened in the past, but almost nothing was happening in the present. I wish the book just started from the 1st wave. Aside from the flashbacks, having all the different views took out the element of surprise. Everything was so predictable or sometimes I thought people were just so dumb... (view spoiler) [ \"You don\u2019t believe you\u2019re a cockroach. If you believed that, you wouldn\u2019t have turned to face the sniper on the highway.\" Okay, seriously, how did he know she turned to face the sniper if he wasn't there??? HOW COME SHE DIDN'T GET THAT??? (hide spoiler) ] In addition I hated how I was lost with the POVs. I was tired by trying to figure out who\u2019s mind it was or if it was a new character trying to be introduced. The really down part for me was the romance. Really empty without real feelings and made no sense. She liked him because he was handsome and, as there were not a lot of girls alive, he was giving her attention. He stopped his alien domination for a plain human because.... There is no because. He just did it for no apparently reason. I feel this is just one more Edward-Bella story all over again, The pray turns into the love interest without logic behind it. (view spoiler) [ And that ending? Why the hell would they kiss/hug? WHYYYY??? She liked the supposed now dead alien, he may (I don't get it so may) like the other girl. (hide spoiler) ] Anyway, as I really liked the writing and a lot of people liked the story. Maybe the problem is with me so I would still recommend it.

This is the first Rick Yancey novel I ever read and it completely blew me away, I don't even know where to start. I wonder why I haven't read this earlier, I feel like such an idiot for only deciding to start reading this because I saw that the movie adaption was almost being released! And now that I've read this, I can't wait till February 12th so I can go see the movie. (Yeah, here in Belgium it's being released almost 3 weeks later than in the US, it sucks.) I loved this book so much, I can't even find a single thing I didn't like! I mean, it took me about 30 pages before I fully got into this, but after that, I breezed through and before I knew it, I finished it. Rick Yancey's writing is just phenomenal! At first, you really don't know where he's going with all the different POV's and so many characters and events happening at the same time, but in the end everything came together really nicely and all the character's adventures built up to the big revelation in the end! There wasn't a single character that I disliked, they were all just so real and easy to relate to. Cassie was the perfect heroine, she was badass and sassy and seriously funny at all the right times. Zombie's chapters were a little darker and showed the other side to the alien invasion, but I loved his perseverance and loyalty. And Evan, oh Evan . He completely stole my heart, he's such a sweetheart and uuurgh, he better return in the next book or I'm going to be seriously pissed! Cassie and Sammy's relationship was so adorable as well! I was so glad when they were finally reunited, I was nearly in tears! You could really tell throughout the book how much they cared for each other. Even though you got POV's from about 4 different characters (which I would usually find a bit much), I grew really emotionally attached to all of them! They all had great character development and there never was a dull moment with any of them. I loved how everything eventually fit together like a really good puzzle. Overall, this novel constantly kept me on my toes and managed to surprise and completely baffle me several times. It was a rollercoaster I'll never forget and I can't wait to start the next book in this series asap! I can already predict that this is going to be one of my favorite book series of all time. To everyone who hasn't read this yet, go do it now, I promise you won't regret it!! ...more Why oh why did I wait so long to read this!?

Rick Yancey writes about an alien invasion of the earth that takes place over several waves. Our protagonist, Cassie, has lost everyone - except for her younger brother Sammy, who she has made it her sole mission to rescue. Yancey shows us many characters' perspectives, including Ben Parish, a former high school football player Cassie once had a crush on, who now fights against the Others in an attempt to save the world. I loved the tight and fast-paced plot of this story, its themes of trust vs. distrust and how to find purpose in a meaningless world, and the development of Ben Parish as well as Cassie and Evan's relationship. Yancey takes us right into the action while unfolding The 5th Wave 's backstory at a solid speed. Throughout the book I found myself whisper-screaming \"oh my Grande, oh my Grande, oh my Grande\" in anticipation of the characters' actions. While I cheered on Ben the most, I also found myself rooting for Cassie and Evan's relationship, which surprised me because I tend to stray away from quick romances. Perhaps Cassie's wit and her fight for independence within the relationship won me over. I wanted just a little more from the characters in The 5th Wave . While I hoped for all of their survivals - I guess it would have been cruel if I did not - I detected some areas for development, which may take place in the second book. Now that this installment has worn off some of the story's more mysterious intrigue, I wonder where its sequel, The Infinite Sea , will take it. Overall, recommended to fans of young-adult science-fiction and dystopia, as well as to those who want to see the movie. Hoping the second book delves even deeper than the first. ...more Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/ \u266a\u266b\u266a\u266aThat's great, it starts with an earthquake.

Rid the humans of their humanity.\u201d Obviously I\u2019m super late to this party so there\u2019s not a whole heck of a lot left to say. I\u2019ll be totally honest and say I had a \u201cbeen there/done that\u201d attitude with respect to The 5th Wave for eternity and had zero intentions of reading it. Then the movie was released and it was my kids\u2019 reward for being brainiacs (I know, hard to believe I\u2019m actually raising NOT juvenile delinquents, right?) so I requested it from the library. Along with everyone else. Yeah, the kids saw the movie weeks ago but my turn at the book just now came around. I was lucky to not get spoiled (I mean AT ALL \u2013 I never even bothered reading the blurb) so I\u2019m going to not spoil any of you and just briefly cover what worked and didn\u2019t for me. First question I was faced with was: Is it possible to enjoy a book while mostly wanting to murder one of the main characters? Answer? Surprisingly so. The world building in this book was off-the-charts good. I assume many have complained about it being too detailed, but it was just what I was looking for. AND HALLELUJAH TO A FEMALE LEAD IN A SUPERAWFUL NEW \u2018MURICA TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO STOCK UP ON TAMPONS. Finally! Praise Jeebus! That being said, unfortunately said female character also talked about a male MC\u2019s eyes being \u201cchocolaty warm \u2013 so melty and sad.\u201d Excuse me a moment . . . . Ahhhh. All better. But as much as I\u2019m done with the instalust bullshittery that gets thrown in to every YA story like this, I was able to keep on keepin\u2019 on \u2013 mainly because there was a whole other cast of characters who were not idiots. And even though I could figure out what was coming and things sometimes seemed a bit too familiar . . . I still had a pretty good time. If this is on your TBR, don\u2019t give it the boot. 3 Stars for the simple fact that even though this is a series I could really give a rat fart about reading book 2. \u201cReview\u201d (term used as loosely as possible) portion aside, let\u2019s talk about casting choices for the film. Female lead is a wallflower with frizzy hair that no one has ever given a second glance to. This I love because at least the \u201coh I\u2019m plain but errrryone magically falls in love with me\u201d Bella Swan syndrome wasn\u2019t in play. However, the film version looks like this . . . Wallflower my fat ass. I guarantee this chick has old men the world over Googling her birthday to make sure Dateline doesn\u2019t show up at their door. Which leads us to the boy she worshipped from afar all throughout high school . . . Srsly? I don\u2019t get it. Also note that I had to Google him because I thought he was like 14 playing the part of a 16 year old. Which leads us to the other guy who is pretty hearthrobby . . . Except for the whole \u201cmelty chocolatey eyes\u201d thing. Whoops. I haven\u2019t yet watched the movie, but I will say I hope to shout it focuses on the action and not the luuuuuuuurv. Generally Sh3lly and I end up reading porn the same thing because she pushes me down and won\u2019t let me up until I submit to her. This time it was coincidental (probably because we are the only people left on the planet who had not yet read this). I like that she shared my opinion of the punchability factor contained in the character Cassie and yet was still able to enjoy the book as a whole. See kids? No need to rage out about everything just because some stupid stuff gets thrown in to the mix. ...more Wow! I was blown away by this story!! I was completely riveted by every single word!

Aliens came, kicked ass, and all that\u2019s left of humanity is three percent of the original population. One of the \u201clucky\u201d survivors is sixteen year-old Cassie. She lived through all Four Waves that\u2019s decimated the human race, and is trying to stay alive by staying alone, because that\u2019s the only way to stay safe. The aliens have cleverly disguised themselves to look like us, so to stay alive you must trust no one. The only thing keeping Cassie going is a promise made to her little brother, five-year old Sammy, to come find him. Then Evan Walker shows up, a savior, and her resolve to stay alone waivers, because surely, he can help rescue her brother, right? I guess we\u2019ll see. I don\u2019t know why, but I love end-of-the-world scenarios. Add in some aliens, and the possibility of mass destruction and you\u2019ve got my attention. Maybe it\u2019s the exciting adrenaline rush I get from the life and death situations laid out before me. Maybe its how life boils down to what really matters, and all the mindless, busy details of our everyday suddenly become unimportant. I always end up asking myself, \u201cwhat would I do?\u201d and I wonder if I could survive. Rick Yancey captures everything that excites me about these stories flawlessly. This 5th Wave was an exhilarating ride filed with action and suspense, and don\u2019t forget my personal favorite: romance. All of it is well done with twists and turns that have you anxious about what happens next. A future with this set of possibilities is frightening . Cassie was a tough but realistic heroine, one I easily liked and identified with from the beginning. It was easy to put myself in her shoes, and agree with the decisions she made. When Evan shows up, things get even more interesting. I couldn\u2019t help but swoon over him with \u201chis soft chocolate eyes, thick wavy hair, and lopsided grin.\u201d Evan is strong and shy, with an intensity that\u2019s hard to ignore. *sigh* Besides Cassie and Evan there is a whole set of secondary characters that make an impression and a few that found a way into my heart. Sam, Cassie\u2019s little brother is at the top of that list, and I just wanted to wrap my arms around him in a tight hug! Five years-old is still practically a baby! The 5th Wave ends in a place that\u2019s bearable, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not lusting after the next book! This story is far from over and I\u2019m curious about how things will play out. Who is friend and who is foe? I\u2019m wondering over a few, but maybe that\u2019s just the paranoia that set in while reading this! A copy was provided by Putnam Juvenile in exchange for a honest review. You can read this review and more at The Readers Den. ...more Okay, so my thoughts are basically: um, well then. Which is reeeally eloquent of me, I KNOW.

Like bullets and freaktastic apocalypse stuff and aliens and really realistic emotions and actions from the characters. I thought Cassie was downright awesome. I liked her! WOOT. ...and then...okay... the part where Evan Walker arrives? It just got so bad . I mean, insta-love, weird reactions from the characters, confusing plots. I JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW. I got rather cranky because the book went from a solid 4 down to a 3 and nooooo I REALLY WANTED TO LOVE ALL OF THIS. Bleh. And I also thought Cassie was the main character. But not really? She has just as much page time as \"Zombie\". At first I didn't like him? And I still don't? But he was hella brave so that was cool. A Brief List Of Other Things I Didn't Like: \u2022 The whole \"fifth wave\" of killings seemed unnecessarily complex to me. (view spoiler) [ Why didn't the aliens just kill all the things??? Why did they need to turn humans against each other and all that? I DON'T GET IT. If they need humans to be hosts, why did they kill so many? (hide spoiler) ] \u2022 What the heeeeck is the wonderland program??? I DON'T GET IT. \u2022 Evan Walker was an entire gallon of creepy. And weird? And he literally saw Cassie and was like \"I love her so so so soooooo much and my life means nothing without her omg.\" Dude, you have so many problems I don't even know where to beginning. \u2022 Sammy was 5? AHAHHAHA. NOT REALLY. I have a 5yo nephew and Sammy was way too mature, okay? \u2022 The ending felt entirely rushed compared to how slow the middle was. ...okay, so quite a few negatives from me. But trust me: I did still like a lot of it! It definitely wasn't as bad as I thought, and I'm 100% enthused to see the movie. I feel like this would all translate awesomely to screen. I also am such a sucker for apocalypse and actiony stuff. And like I said: Cassie was really awesome. (When she wasn't smooching Evan.) And I looooove books about siblings doing ANYTHING to rescue each other. Like, be still my beating emotions. <3 Plus I want to know what happens next?!? Like a lot . So this is a series I'm going on with for sure! ALSO I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE ALIENS. The 5th Wave was a good read for me, but turned me off with the awful romance . And I do wish I'd known it wasn't just Cassie's story. OH. And I wish the chapters had been marked with whose POV it was. Because I hate sitting there and trying to tell. Is it that hard to say \"THIS IS ZOMBIE\" and \"THIS IS CASSIE\"? Nunnnngh. -_- ...more This is the response I sent to his agent after reading the manuscript: This is DAMN and WOW territory.
