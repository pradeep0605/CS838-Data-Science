OTHER CAMPERS: (chanting) one of us, one of us... KYLIE: Like, I still don't believe you. HOLIDAY: Well, us supernaturals have the ability to read each other's mind, and according to our mind readings on you, you are a supernatural. Or you have a brain tumor. KYLIE: Like, no way. I'll take the tumor. (thinks about it) Actually, on second thoughts... Like, I dunno. I'm, like, super conflicted! (walks back to cabin) MIRANDA AND DELLA: Hi, we're your roomies.

This is Born at Midnight in a nutshell. You might be thinking that that doesn't sound like much of a plot. Or that that's an awful lot of guys for one book. Or that Kylie sounds, like, super annoying. Or that the dialogue is totally unrealistic and no one, teenager or otherwise, really talks like that. If you're thinking that, you're absolutely correct. So many things are wrong with this book that it becomes almost comical, and it might have been funny if I hadn't been wasting hours of my life reading this. The first of many problems is Kylie. The narrative is from third person, and seems to be modeled after Valley Girl stereotypes a la Clueless's Cher. But Cher was created as an extreme, a parody of a caricature in a chick flick. Kylie is supposed to lead us through a story, and if a fantasy starts out with us doubting the plausibility of a normal human character, you know trouble lies ahead. Along with sounding exaggeratedly false and unrealistic, Kylie is also a huge pain in the rear. She's one of those 'sexy and I know it' girls who I just can't relate to, and she's very self-focused, as well as judgmental about everyone else around her. She's quick to label the kids at her camp as freaks because they have multiple piercings or colorful hair. The kids at my high school, \"popular\" crowd included, often have nose/cartilage piercings and/or colored hair, and yes, even in the twenty-first century, there's still a crowd that dresses in all black. It could just be where I live, but I'm pretty sure it's not that uncommon, especially among teenagers. Kylie acts like she's never been exposed to the world before. The other characters, particularly Derek and Lucas, were just as unbelievable. Derek's the kind, sweet, understanding love interest and Lucas is the egotistical player, but they're practically interchangeable. Kylie gets all hot and bothered whenever one of them is in a twenty feet radius of her, and even though she's not ready for a relationship or sex or anything, she can't seem to stop herself from making out with one of them every time they're in her line of vision (BTW, the writing for the make out scenes was borderline ridiculous. At one point CC Hunter was describing the hardness of Kylie's nipples. Too much information, bro.). Derek and Lucas were essentially just boy toys, there to kiss her or comfort her when she needed it, but they didn't really contribute to the plot or story. Not that there was much to contribute to. Born at Midnight is basically four hundred pages of infodumping about supernaturals and Kylie moaning and groaning about boy problems, home problems and identity problems. Towards the end, there's the semblance of a climax, but by that point I had started skimming and none of it made a lick of sense. Remember that book about kids sent to a summer camp for demigods? The one that blossomed into a five-book series full of humor and fabulous adventure? Well, Born at Midnight is no Percy Jackson. Camp Half Blood is almost as cool as Hogwarts, but Shadow Falls is flat and boring. There's no archery, no centaurs, no awesome cabins or Capture the Flags. The only camp activities ever described were campfires and what was essentially a dating service, where guys have to draw a girl's name and talk to her for an hour. Really? It's just a ploy for Kylie to talk to Derek/Lucas. My only exposure to summer camps have been at the local Christian camp, where guys and girls are not encouraged to go hang out alone together, but maybe this is acceptable at other camps. But between the dating services and the lax-if-existent rules about guys in girls cabins, the camp seemed pretty unrealistic to me. Really, the only reason it's a camp is because the author wanted to get the parents out of the way and not have her characters deal with school. Other than that, Shadow Falls has no real place in the book, and it fell flat as anything more than a plot device for getting a bunch of supernaturals together. I dunno... Honestly, I was hoping for something fun and adventurous, like the Percy Jackson books, but what I got was four hundred pages of failure sealed with a rather lovely purple cover. This is one of the weakest paranormal books I've read in a while, and... that's really sad, considering it's coming in last to the likes of Hush, Hush and Fallen. Don't be fooled by the cover or the blurb; look at it, pick it up, sigh a little and then set it gently back down on the shelf. And then go reread the Percy Jackson or Harry Potter books. Even if it's your third or fourth or eighty-second time through the series, they're still much more satisfying than Born at Midnight. ...more A couple of years ago I went with my friends to see the movie Sinister ; it had become sort of a tradition of ours to go out all together maybe once a month and see whatever shitty scary movie was playing at the cinema.

We've seen some terrible ones and some surprisingly good ones, and I think the worst was probably Sinister . Towards the end, as scary movies often do, it got ridiculous, and we were screaming with laughter at the little kids in the hallway and the bad mask and the CGI and...I'm crying thinking about it. My friend leans over to me at this point and whispers, \"There's no redeeming this,\" and I laughed so hard I nearly shit my pants. And it speaks beautifully of my experience with this book: there's no redeeming it, not even if it makes you laugh, which it probably won't. Because there's nothing funny about it, is there? There's nothing funny about a heroine who refers to another character as a \"screw toy\". How is that entertainment? How is anybody entertained by that sort of ugly, problematic, misogynistic language? Do you think it's okay to call another woman a \"screw toy\"? Do you really? I can't even comment on the fantasy elements of this book. They were background to me. I just felt like I was being clobbered over the head, over and over and over again, by this grotesque sexist rhetoric. Apparently our heroine is a good girl because she's a virgin and her best friend \"gave it away\" so she deserves what she gets. Of course, Best Friend gets a pregnancy scare and she deeply regrets sex because it *changed her, oh, no!*. Kylie also doesn't drink, which means she's an extra 'good girl'. So let's break this down (I wish I could make tables on GR). Kylie: doesn't drink, virgin, white, straight, cisgender. Affluent. Best Friend (I can't even remember her name): drinks, not a virgin, white, straight, cisgender, affluent. The difference between them is their sexual status and their attitudes to alcohol. So let's look at the outcomes: Kylie: Magical Chosen One. Falls in love with a sexy magical creature who *respects her boundaries*. In fact, all the boys are in love with her, but none of them touch her. Best Friend: Has a pregnancy scare. Cries over her virginity. Mistreated by boys. Single. It's a perfect Madonna/Whore dichotomy. Kylie is our Madonna, and because of her sexual status and her rejecting alcohol, boys flock to her, but they're \"good boys\" who will never ever have sex with her and who'll whisper sweet nothings in her ear. They'll say things like \"I'm sorry I'm so fucked up\" and when she cries they'll kiss away her tears and it'll be so beautiful. Best Friend is the Whore - the one who \"gave it away\". Her sexual status and her attitudes to alcohol mean that she hasn't got a hope of being wanted by any boy who'll treat her kindly. Her sex wrecked her, thus she's deserving of Kylie's disgust. In fact, there's an aura of disgust and \"well, that's what happens!\" surrounding Best Friend. But it's made clear that Kylie warned Best Friend not to \"give it away\". And what did Best Friend do? She did it! Well, Kylie told her so! It's not necessarily about the act of sex itself; it's about blame. Kylie is innocent, because she's a virgin. She without sin will cast the first stone - and the stone will hit Best Friend. There's a very, very strong undercurrent of \"I told you so!\" particularly because of the pregnancy scare. But that blame goes far beyond teenage pregnancy - the vast majority of which is caused, quite ironically, by ignorance towards sex, which this book strongly promotes - and it spills into rape culture. That's what slut-shaming is all about. \"I told you so!\" everyone will say, if a boy at a party or at college or in a club rapes Best Friend. Everyone will say \"it's a shame\" but there's always a footnote of \"...but she was drinking\" or \"to be fair, she's not exactly a virgin\". That's what it comes down to. The dichotomy is not necessarily about some flippant consensual sex someone had, but about what our attitudes would be toward rape. If someone rapes Kylie, then the world drowns in tears for the loss of \"innocence\" (alas, this does not save Kylie from being dubbed \"broken\" or from having some male character charge off to seek revenge for her, thus advancing his own character development; I can't even count how many female character's rapes have existed only to advance the character development of a man). But if someone rapes Best Friend, we've already established a culture of blame around her. Her skirt was too short, or she was drunk, or let's be honest, I mean, she was always a reckless girl, wasn't she? Rape, blame and worth are all tied up in the sexism that this book screams like a foghorn. The women in this book exist on a staircase of worth - virginal Kylie stands on the top step, and the partying girls are clustered at the very bottom. It's like XVI, where the Best Friend of that book was raped and murdered, and the grandmother or whatever says, \"Well, she always wore such a short skirt\". \"Worth\" is not a scale with which to measure human beings. \"Worth\" does not exist, because worth is not part of the equation. At no point should any human being's \"worth\" even be debated, because no body deserves to be hurt or shamed any more than any other. This is what makes \"screw toy\" so unbelievably problematic; that one should label another human being as if they weren't one. \"Screw toy\" is pure dehumanization. Dehumanization is the root of all violence, be it verbal, physical or sexual. This book deserves no stars. It makes me feel physically sick to think about it. To think that it got a higher rating than Mockingjay , which, although quite a letdown, tackled incredibly important themes such as war, dehumanization, slavery, PTSD, class and poverty. Even Unwind , which so deftly discussed the fault in human \"worth\", the ways in which our social system fails our youth, generation gaps, and the horrific outcomes of forced pregnancy, is only .04 of a star higher than this book. For fuck's sake, why? People will like what they like. Books are there to be enjoyed. But this book is a manifesto of misogyny and hatred. This book is appalling bad. I was going to lighten the mood with an Adore Delano GIF, but I don't want to associate her and the joy she brings me with this book in any way. So this is it: a sombre wall of text.

Because it\u2019s the type of love triangle that\u2019s complex and makes you think . So far, we don\u2019t know the two boys well enough to decide who is best for Kylie and, also, I feel like there\u2019s a mystery behind Derek\u2019s life that the author will be developing in the sequels. There sure could have been less romance, but when you have two love interests it\u2019s hard not to have a considerable amount of romance. The writing could have been better, too. I said that the book is light and greatly enjoyable, and I\u2019m not going to go back on my word, but maybe another reason to that is because the writing is full of everyday commonly used words. It reads so naturally and well so, in the end, it didn\u2019t bother me, but I must admit it makes some events lack the \u2018\u2018seriousness\u2019\u2019 that could have been so easy to create and apply to the atmosphere. Also, there are two camp leaders at the Shadow Falls camp, Sky and Holiday, but those too lack seriousness as well. They feel more like campers themselves than \u2018\u2018bosses.\u2019\u2019 Holiday talks to Kylie like she is one of her friends and she even uses the type of vocabulary you would expect a teenager to use. Despite certain flaws, I\u2019m going to say this one last time: ENGAGING READ THAT WILL CHARM YOU. ...more Meet Lucas and Derek on the Bewitched Bookworms First of, isn't the cover super super pretty??

After being caught at a Party where some kids where doing drugs, her shrink poposed to send her to a Camp for special kids. There she learns that there is a whole supernatural world out there, Vamps, Werewolves, Faeries, you name it - they all exists! And this Camp is a place where kids can learn about the other species and learn to live with their special abilities and gifts. The Problem is no one knows what Kylie is and she hates being there and being \"not normal\"... She can see Ghosts.. We follow Kylie on her journey to accept herself and her supernatural gift and try to find out what she is. She's making new friends: a Vampire Girl and a Witch. And of course there are boys... Actually 3 of them. *gasps* Normally I hate triangles, specially since one boy will always loose and I feel bad for him. Plus I normally have a pretty good idea with whom she will end up. For some reason, it didn't bother me at all here. There is Trey , her Ex who is a normal human and was cheating on her but of course now realized that he wants her back. Then we have Derek, the Faerie that can sense emotions and is super gorgeous and absolutely lovely and the nice guy - I Like him ..a LOT! Last but not least there is Lucas... and he has it all in the hotness apartment, dark hair and bright blue eyes - dark and mysterious! Derek is the safe choice while Lucas the exciting one.

Troubled teens being an euphemish for troubled supernatural teens. I have to admit I had so many issues with this book. At first I respected Kylie for wanting to save her virginity for someone special,then she let the reader know what happens if you hurry into losing your virginity (her friend does) You sleep around,start to party hard and wear revealing clothes (IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!) So basically the author is saying you can be a madonna or a whoreOo In the end she got a holier than thou personality I especially like *sarcasm* how she admits feeling good about listening to other peoples problems So the main character is a girl who looks down on girls who arent virgins,take comfort in friends problems and twists her father around her little finger. hmm well she sounds so nice! And the twitching eyebrow thingy...was just so so silly.You have to read it just to understand what I mean.

It could have been a lot of fun to read about a summer camp of witches, vampires, werewolves, fairies, etc. Like Percy Jackson or something! This was nothing, like Percy Jackson. The camp was just a way to get these kids away from their parents, but what did they do?! I still don't even know. They went to a couple of camp fires... they drew each other's names (of course our main character always got the really hot boys) and they went and talked for an hour in the woods. There were parent days where the parent sat and talked to the kid for an hour and left. That's honestly it. Another thing that could have been kinda cool was Kylie seeing ghosts. But instead she was just in denial for 90% of the book. Also I read all 400 pages and never learned what she is? Ugh. I didn't appreciate the author calling something \"retarded\" nor did I like that she referred to something as \"too gay\". It shouldn't surprise you by this point in the review that I thought this entire book was poorly written. It barely had a plot and what it did have the poorly written characters ruined it. The author constantly threw in things that did nothing to further the plot at all. At all. This was no fun to read and I'm honestly shocked that I finished it. I do not recommend it, there are much better paranormal books out there if you're in the mood for one. ...more This review is also available on my blog, Qwerty This book is like one massive parody of all-things paranormal.

Expecting us to salivate over the possibilities, the author is playing \"keep away\" with something that NO ONE REALLY CARES ABOUT ANYWAY. Here is an actual conversation from the book between Kylie and her mentor- an irritating woman named \"Holiday\" who is supposed to come off as intelligent, but gives vague, unimpressionable answers that really just annoy the **** out of me. Kylie : But, do we know- I mean, if I am one of you, that I'm not like a vampire of a werewolf?\" Holiday : \"I'm guessing if you were of that species, we would have seen some of the normal characteristics that are linked to them.\" Kylie : But you don't think I'm a vampire or werewolf, right? Holiday : \"I think that's unlikely.\" Kylie : So, assuming I'm not human, I'm also not a fairy?\" Holiday : \"I didn't say that.\" Kylie : \"Is being a ghost whisper a common gift for elves?\" Holiday : \"Generally... but it's not unheard of for others to have that ability, as well.\" Kylie : \"So, what else could I be?\" ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BEG?

The author comes across as a 70 year-old woman (which she is, pretty much) who wants to be \"hip\" and use \"teenage\" language. Sorry, \"c.c hunter,\" but it isn't cool to spell your name in lower case letters. It's also uncool to use words like \"mo fo\" and \"dad gone-it,\" and \"gosh darn-it.\" I could have also done without the pregnancy theme that came across as a rant to teenagers to stop having sex. Who does she think she's preaching to? This is supposed to be entertainment, and instead it felt like an intensely difficult task. Like math homework. Seriously.

I had been seeing this book around in Barnes and Noble as well as some people's shelfs. I had read a little about it and I was determined to read the series. I have to say though, that I was a little disappointed. The Cover So I know that we shouldn't judge a book by its cover but, come on. We all do it even if we don't mean to. This cover is really cool. She's standing on a tree that seems to be split down the middle. I thought that this could be figurative for choices as if you're in a fork in the road. There is fog with white light so you can't see past it which is kind of mysterious. Overall, that is a pretty nice cover. The Plot Kylie Galen has had a pretty rough life. Her grandmother died, boyfriend Trey dumped her, her parents are getting a divorce and she is getting sent to some camp by her mother. Kylie doesn't want to go to Shadow Falls with the other \"bad kids\" that seem to be there who she later learns to be supernaturals. Being there will vampires, werewolves and many other supernatural creatures, she doesn't feel more out of place but for some reason everything she should be. She tries to leave but then is conflicted whether she wants to for a couple of reasons. Her parents are divorced and she isn't getting along that well with them as well as the fact that she would leave people at the camp. Of course there are two guys that can't help but have feelings for as well as her two new best friends. Throughout the book, Kylie is on the search for her true identity as well trying to keep control with it. What I liked The action. There was some action where I was getting a little impatient trying to get to and ended up skimming parts that I had to go back and read. The plot lines. There were many plot lines going on during the whole book that were at times hard to keep track of but most of the time is was okay. The depth of imagination. Ms. Hunter was able to create some things that I wasn't expecting and I enjoyed. The history and interactions of the campers were pretty interesting at times. What I didn't like or could have been better The characters. I did have a slight problem with Kylie. She was whiny and daresay, self centered. When there was a problem she got annoyed that she couldn't complain or whine about it to anyone. When that someone overcame their problem, she was like \"good I don't need to worry about that. I have my own bigger problems.\" That is what I got out of it at least. Overall, the other characters weren't that well developed. They each had one problem that lasted throughout the book. I was a little upset about that because I thought that they could have had some interesting pasts because they are, you know, supernatural and had cool abilities. Besides that, at times I got a little bored. I know that I above said that there was action but that was only some of the time. Other times I was actually skimming and wasn't going to reread it. I guess that there was too much description or it was for another reason that I don't remember right now. The love segment. It wasn't a triangle but Kylie did alternate about who she liked. Derek, Lucas, Derek, Lucas, etc. That was a little annoying and I just thought that she didn't need to have someone that she liked all the time. If she did, she should choose. I did have a personal favorite but I'm not going to say who it was. I think you all have one if you read this book. Overall I was slightly disappointed with this book and I might want to read the next one because I hate leaving series unfinished unless 1) I either know that they aren't good or 2) I really didn't like the first book. Hopefully the characters will get a little better and the boring parts less sparse. So that's it. I think that I said everything I had to say. ...more Kylie.. ..a girl leading a normal life.

Her parents are divorcing, her boyfriend broke up with her for the same reason boyfriends usually do -she said no, and to top it all off she's got a stalker that no one else but her can see. She's seeing a shrink, but it hasn't helped. When the police raid a party that she's at and the police find drugs and alcohol, her mother ships her off to a summer camp for troubled teens. This is not a real camp for troubled teens. Kylie learns on the bus to camp that the kids that are \"troubled\" are very unique. One boy can change the color of his eyes to any color. Another girl with multi colored hair has a toad on her leg. And one very normal looking boy reminds her a lot of her ex boyfriend and she's immediately attracted to him. Shadow Falls Camp is, she finds out for supernaturals, vampires, werewolves, faeries, shapeshifters,ghosts and anything else she can think of. Kylie doesn't believe she belongs there yet she has blood curdling screaming, night terrors and can't remember them the next morning. And her stalker she finds out is a ghost who literally gives her the chills. Apparently, no one knows what kind of supernatural Kylie is, her parents won't admit to being supernaturals or haven't told her they are supernaturals. Kylie works with the camp counselor to try to figure out if she really is a supernatural which she denies she is throughout most of the book. All the other supers can read each others brain patterns by wiggling their eyebrows (I know but it's presented better in the book) but no one can read Kylie's brain patterns and she can't read anyone else's brain patterns. If she isn't a supernatural, her other options are that she's crazy or she has a brain tumor, two not very promising options, but Kylie prefers them than to being supernatural. During camp activities, getting to know your campmates hour, names are chosen and Derek, the boy that reminds Kylie of her ex draws her name and leads her to a magical little place near the water where they sit and talk and almost kiss. But her ex Trey is going to soccer camp just a few miles down the road and wants her to forgive him and meet him somewhere. And then there's Lucas -who used to live next door to her when she was young and killed her cat. She remembers him looking over the fence saying, \"If you don't want your new kitten to suffer the same fate as your cat, bring him in at night.\" But this Lucas doesn't match up with the Lucas of her childhood and her memory brings back times when he saved her from bullies and walked her home from school. She has a unique experience with him on get to know your camp mate hour. Throughout this teenage drama, lurks the FRU, Fallen Research Unit who fund the camp for supernaturals. They wear dark suits and walk around interrogating students about what we don't know until the last bit of the book but everyone is under suscipion, especially Kylie because she can't be read. Tension surmounts between the various supernaturals. Werewolves accuse vampires of crimes, and vice versa. Faeries and Witches are at odds. And FRU is constantly overheard threatening to shut down the camp. Add in Parents Day on the weekends for some, like vampires who's parents don't know they've been turned. Or witches with pressure to pass exams. Or Kylie who's parents don't know what type of camp Shadow Falls really is. She finally learns to accept the other supernaturals, not as monsters but as friends. Her roommates are a witch and a vampire and they stand up for her when she needs them most. There is a point towards the end where I almost cried. There isn't a dull moment in this novel. I read it fast, in one day, but it did take all day. I'm sure I'll read it again but I promised to send it on an ARC tour so I needed to get it on its way. This novel has a little of everything romance, adventure, suspense, mystery, and definitely leaves you wanting more. I sure hope <---A>C.C. Hunter</---A> writes fast because I already want the next one and this one hasn't even been released! As far as age appropriateness goes, older teen, there is a teen pregnancy scare, talk about sex and a little bit of touching going on. Nothing below the waist! ...more I can honestly say it was better than I'd thought it'd be. I looked at the back of it, and I just shook my head. It was only pure curiosity that made me read it.

It means borderline screw-this-shit and fine-whatever. I have some serious problems with this book. First of all, Kylie was freakin irritating as hell. She was so close-minded and stubborn and worst of all---in denial. I absolutely despise characters in denial. Example of Stupidity #1: Kylie is in denial about being a Ghost Whisperer Let's see. She talked to a dead man. She has three dozen people telling her she's a ghost whisperer. She's seen a girl poof a frog in and out of existence. She has night terrors about the dead guy. She saw a boy turn into a UNICORN. A GODDAMN UNICORN! No. There's no way Kylie can possibly be special. That stuff just doesn't exist. [image error] Example of Stupidity #2 : She doesn't like Derek. Holy Jebus, Kylie. You are dumb. This non-pervert, nice, cute, caring guy likes you and all you can do is stay away from him and tell him no? What the hell? Do you really think a better opportunity is going to come along? Especially for someone as whiny and burdening as you? Example of Stupidity #3: Goths are, like, sooooo weird! The freaks! Omigawd, did you see that chick? She was wearing all black, even nailpolish ! What hell is wrong with them? They're probably, like, depressed or some stupid shit like that. LOLz. Look, now she's hanging out with the other freaks over there. I'm so happy I'm me and not them. I can't imagine how it must feel to be a social outcast. I'd rather trade my dog than ever be stuck with those freaks! LMAOz, I bet they're, like, suicidal or something. Ahaha, weirdos. Kylie, you close-minded moron, you. Example of Stupidity #4: Can't... Resist.... Trey... So let me get this straight---The dude dumped you, dated a \"slut\", and then came to your closet of a bedroom to have sex with you? And you ALLOW THIS? I would've bitch-slapped that douchebag hard enough to leave a dent in his face! What the hell! Example of Stupidity #5: Everything. I really, realy hate Kylie. She's an overall moron and really deserves a slap in the face for her views on \"Goth\" and \"emo\" people. I don't know what Derek sees in her. The bad guy kind of took me by surprise. The villain ended up being a person who was mentioned about two times throughout the entire book. It wasn't a whodunit at all. It was a Nancy Drew with a side of angst. Really annoying, pessimistic, I'm-too-good-for-you, I-miss-my-jackass-of-a-boyfriend kind of angst. ...more I'm 3% into this book, and I cannot bring myself to go on.

(page 11) I beg your pardon, but are you fucking kidding me? How am I supposed to like a character who calls another girl a \"screw toy\" and judges her best friend's worth based on the fact that she's not a virgin anymore? I am beyond disgusted, and if 10 pages of this \"book\" have already managed to get me to despise both the main character and, unfortunately, the author, I cannot imagine what reading the whole book could cause. So I'm going to stop right here. ...more Oh, how I love this book! It wasn't planned that I wanted to read this book. I had seen it once or twice, but I dind't really came through to me, but one day (I was in need of books at the time) I saw it in a store.

Kylie Galen is a girl with several problems: parents, whom are getting a divorce, a dead grandmother and a stalker and her boyfriend just recently broke up with her. She didn't had a perfect life, and it's something that really applies to me. Kylie is a character you easily love, and I love how she reacts when she is told what really is going on with her. Besides of being a loveable character, she surrounds herself with two amazing guys - Derek and Lucas. And after reading the book, I must admit, I love Lucas most. Her roomies is both nice and I love their fight, it's a nice touch to the book. The story Della told about her and Lee really touched me. Anyway, the book is amazing, and because of the amazing characters, the good storyline and the awesome story in general, I can look past the mistakes in the translation to Danish. Love the book.

As Kylie struggles to cope with the realization that these creatures even exist, and the fact that she might not be human, she's got two hot guys, a werewolf and a half-fairy vying for her attention. And they can just keep vying. Kylie's determined that before she lets her heart loose on love, she needs to unearth the truth. What does the ghost want? Who can and can't she trust? And most of all . . . What is she? This is the summary I read when I first saw this book. Judging from the tone of the passage (you can tell I had English today), you'd think this book would be snarky, narcissistic and a buttload of fun. Sadly, that's not the case. By the time I got to page 100, I really didn't care whether or not the MC was dead or not. For one, it's written in third-person (a pet-peeve of mine, especially when having done otherwise would highly benefit the book). This book is the worst possible book ever to have been written in third person. I've been visiting CC Hunter's website since reading this book, and I'm actually really excited for the next installments in the series, even though this one was on the short side of FAIL.

Kylie\u2019s life is breaking down around her: her parents consider divorce, her boyfriend dumps her and immediately starts going out with another girl, and a stalker has been introduced into her life. It isn\u2019t until Kylie gets caught at a party -- with under-aged drinking and drugs galore -- that her life gets turned completely upside down. Her Ice Queen mom decides to send her to Shadow Falls Camp, a psychologist-recommended institution for troubled teens. And soon, Kylie discovers herself stranded in the midst of brainwave-reading paranormal creatures that couldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t exist. Confused but feeling an undeniably weird sense of belonging, Kylie begins to realize just how special she really is. Kylie\u2019s stalker also starts to make sense -- a startling relief after all the anxiety. But then trouble invades the camp, and the paranormals are pointing fingers at each other. Beware, happy little campers, someone has an agenda of their own, and they are quite the determined bunch. C.C. Hunter\u2019s debut, Born at Midnight , was attention-grabbing and hard to put down. However, the plot started out incredibly slowly. It is slightly understandable, as the author has to first describe the characters and the setting of this new series. But the predicament, which should be central to every novel, was brief and felt like an after-thought. Imagine this: pages after pages of descriptions and little action, a few chapters devoted to the build-up of tension, the short resolution, and then the end of the novel, which ends up feeling like accidentally running smack into a brick wall and maybe losing a few teeth in the process. And onto the apparently mandatory element of a YA PNR book: the love triangle. The one that exists in this book felt pretty much superfluous. There was no reason for its creation in the first place, and Kylie\u2019s indecision and fluctuating feelings becomes a bore to read about after a while. Girl, it is not right to be lusting after three guys (her ex-boyfriend included) at once, especially if you alternate between thinking about kissing one boy to thinking about the hotness of another a second later. Born at Midnight is a nice read, not entirely original, but interesting nonetheless. The second installment of the series, Awake at Dawn , will be released in October 2011.

She is very hard on her mother, who she calls Ice Queen and talks about how awful it is to live with her, and although later she learns that there's more that meets the eye with her mom, I was unable to have any reason to believe that Kylie's feelings about her mom were justified. Kylie whines about her life a lot, but she has to be one of the least sympathetic characters I have ever read about, so I could not empathize with her character at all. Kylie, and likewise the author, have no respect for women, and I found the way women were treated in this book was very offensive. Within the first few pages of the book, she calls her exes' new girlfriend slutty and criticizes how she is dressed- she wore short shorts, what a slut! Oh, and she called her a screw toy. And then ranted for a whole page about how her friend has had sex with 3 guys and so she's \"different\" now. The author dehumanized a lot of the female characters in this book because she was very focused on their sexuality. Kylie was a good, smart virgin. The girls who have sex or wear short shorts? Sluts. Yet Kylie feels attracted to the sexual males in the book, and they are never criticized for their choices. I hate hate hate being preached at that \"sex is bad,\" which is a message that appears a lot in this book, but even worse is \"sex is bad...if you're a girl.\" The romances in this book made no sense and came out of nowhere. There was no development, it just went straight into making out and mushy romantic feelings. And the love interests were idiots. Scratch that, all the characters in this book were idiots. The writing itself is awful as well. The author tries to sound like a teenager..and it just didn't work. It was juvenile, even for a young adult book. I felt embarrassed for the author while reading this book. She used a lot of analogies that made no sense, and there were plenty of sentences I remember reading and thinking, \"What? Why would you write that that way?\" And she used the word \"gaze\" a lot. In a nutshell, this book has terrible, juvenile writing, idiotic characters, a snobby brat of a protagonist, misogyny, and general preaching. I'm not sure a book has ever made me this angry before. ...more After finishing the last page of Born at Midnight, I didn\u2019t think about the story once the entire night.

Her parents are on the verge of a divorce and at the recommendation of Kylie\u2019s therapist, After finishing the last page of Born at Midnight, I didn\u2019t think about the story once the entire night. It was only when I sat down at my computer to write this review that I realized that while I enjoyed this book, the story left no lasting impression. The main character, Kylie, is a supernatural being that can see ghosts, but she is unwilling to admit that she is any different from any other 17 year old. Her parents are on the verge of a divorce and at the recommendation of Kylie\u2019s therapist, she is shipped off to Shadow Falls Summer camp for troubled youth. While Shadow Falls is indeed a place for troubled teens, Kylie quickly learns that this is no ordinary camp. Surrounded by witches, fairies, vampires, shape shifters, and werewolves; Kylie must accept that she too is a descendant of the gods. The only other alternative is that she has a brain tumor. This premise is nothing new, but the story is entertaining nonetheless. The most appealing aspect of this book is the characters. Kylie is a very likable protagonist who is on a journey of self-discovery. Learning to accept that there are things in her life that she cannot change is just one of the many hurdles that she must face. Her anger towards her parents and reluctance to admit that she is anything other than ordinary is understandable given her unique situation. Often times when characters are in these types of situations they come off as whiny or slow on the uptake, so it\u2019s refreshing to have a protagonist that readers can empathize with. Kylie\u2019s roommates Miranda and Della are quirky and fun and some of the more humorous scenes are when they are giving Kylie a crash course in what life can be like when you\u2019re rooming with a witch and a vampire. There is even a perverted shape shifter that is sure to give more than one reader a chuckle. The laughs stop however, when the plot begins to tread on familiar ground. Tell me, have you ever found yourself in a situation where you had to juggle the affections of three different men? No? Honestly, unless you\u2019re a rock star, the likelihood of this happening is fairly slim. Kylie, however, constantly finds herself at the center of a lot of male attention. There is the handsome, emotionally available fairy that just wants to make it work, the sexy werewolf that tries to keep his distance, and the sleazy ex-boyfriend who just can\u2019t take a hint. Kylie makes out with, agonizes over, and rejects all three of these men at least once in this novel. I\u2019m all for love triangles and even the occasional love square, but this whole scenario was over the top. Reading Born at Midnight was a little like watching a movie on cable. Chances are you\u2019ve seen several movies just like it, but you continue to watch regardless because it\u2019s entertaining. The problem with these types of movies is that once the credits start to roll, you get up and get on with your life, instantly forgetting what you just watched. Or in this case, what you\u2019ve just read. This isn\u2019t to say that this is a bad book. It just isn\u2019t anything that fans of the genre haven\u2019t read countless times before. *Won ARC on Goodread's Giveaways* ...more Oh god, what did I just read? Seriosuly, this looked like a really good book but then Kylie had to open her mouth and ruin everything. This book has a good plot but characters are so dumb I barely could tolerate it. Not just Kylie, it's all of them: Miranda, Della, Derek, even Lucas. They all are so immature and shallow. It was really hard bonding with them. Truth be told, I only liked Daniel the Ghost. Issues I had with Kylie: her immaturity, the fact that she couldn't get over her ex-boyfriend Oh god, what did I just read?

Not just Kylie, it's all of them: Miranda, Della, Derek, even Lucas. They all are so immature and shallow. It was really hard bonding with them. Truth be told, I only liked Daniel the Ghost. Issues I had with Kylie: her immaturity, the fact that she couldn't get over her ex-boyfriend and fell in love with a guy who reminded her of him (what kind of messed up kid does that?!), how she couldn't stop claiming that she's just a human, how she pinned everyone in camp as freaks, and how she solved every situation in a second after someone gave her the right clues... I mean, really, you couldn't think of that before?! Guys are just there so she can pin over them. And I can't believe that she was afraid of Lucas because he supposedly killed her cat when they were kids! What, that makes him a serial killer now?! I know a bunch of kids who killed cats in their childhood but they're still decent human beings. I'm not even going to start on Miranda. Does that girl ever think of anything else except boys?! I'm not going to continue with this series. As much as I liked her ghosts (not how she was ignorant towards them) and am curious what will happen with Lucas (totally on his team!) I just can't cope with her attitude. Sorry, C.C. Hunter, this is just not for me... ...more WOW. Oh wow!! I am speechless! Born at Midnight was absolutely thrilling!! If I could have read it in one day, I totally would have! I didn not want to put that book down since I picked it up and started reading it. Unfortunately, my life is hectic and would not allow me to read it that quickly. I loved, loved, loved this book!! The plot, the suspense, the romance, the characters-all of it! Nothing but good raves about this book. On to the review now...... So Kylie Galen, a 16 year old ordinary g WOW. Oh wow!! I am speechless! Born at Midnight was absolutely thrilling!!

Unfortunately, my life is hectic and would not allow me to read it that quickly. I loved, loved, loved this book!! The plot, the suspense, the romance, the characters-all of it! Nothing but good raves about this book. On to the review now...... So Kylie Galen, a 16 year old ordinary girl gets caught at a party with drugs and alcohol. The cops break it up and she get's sent to a camp for \"troubled teens\". Or so she thinks that's what it is. But in reality, it's a camp for all supernaturals. Confused as to why she was sent to that scary uninviting place with witches, vampires, fairies, werewolves, and shapeshifters, she tries to find out some answers. Though since she was little she always had night terrors and saw ghosts. Or at least one in particular. Overtime, she dscovers she's not so normal after all. Eventually, she makes friends with her cabin mates Della, a vampire and Miranda a witch once she accepts them for who they are. Or shall I say, what they are. Their friendship grows and becomes something so beautiful. Miranda and Della would do anything for Kylie if she needed anything. As if things can't get more complicated on top of her parents also getting divorced and her boyfriend breaking up with her because she wont have sex with him. She falls hard for Lucas, a hot and mysteriously sexy werewolf and Derek, a sweet, caring, gorgeous green eyed half fae who makes your heart skip a beat. Finally fitting in for once in her life, eventhough she doesn't know exactly what she is yet because no one can really read her brain patterns. She finally enjoys her time at Shadow Falls Camp. So many discoveries unravel and she learns some shocking news about her parents, Lucas leaves the camp with a she-wolf, her feelings for Derek increase, her ghost finally talks to her asking for help in something important and it's enough to keep her from falling apart.... Well, I will stop there. I could go on and on about this book. But I feel everyone should read it. It is simply amazing! It has a great plot, plenty of action and edge of your seat events that keep you turning the page and the romance is oh-so-amazing! I can't chose between Derek and Lucas. They are both so damn sexy and I would love to have both for myself. Poor Kylie has to decide who she cares about more. Though the fact that Derek can manipulate her feelings is a slight turn off. But the way he cares for Kylie is magical and he is so patient with her. *sigh* He makes my heart skip a beat. But so does Lucas. In all honesty, I think either one would be just great for her. This new series is one I am so excited about. I have started the sequel and just love it. Five stars doesn't do justice for this book! ...more Ugh. This book to me was pretty much a mixture of all the other YA PNR books out there. It's one of those books where I rolled my eyes a lot and finished it with an unsatisfied sigh. Let's see: 1. Vampires, werewolves and faeries - Check 2. Mary Sue heroine with unique powers - Check 3. Dickhead heroes - Check 4. Shitty love triangle - Check Yup. Didn't find much originality, really. And the characters were just hard to like. I'd give this book 2 stars, though, because it was bad, but not totally a p Ugh.

Sound familiar? Yeah you couldn't fit a sheet of paper between this and a half-dozen other young adult fantasies. It's good, just not all that original.

She is sent to a camp for troubled teens because she was at a party where there was drugs and liquor and her mother was not having it! Now to get to the point of the book...Kylie realizes that everyone at the camp has paranormal gifts and she doesn't believe she fits in even though she sees ghost. The ghost was a good twist to the story. Her new roommates Miranda and Della are showing her the ropes and are fun, and witty. During this quest she starts second guessing about her parents and their true identity. Also, there are some unexplained events at the camp that has the government threatening to close camp. Now comes the boy saga; Her ex-boyfriend Trey pays her a visit at the camp in an attempt to win her back and after a makeout session she decides its just not time to reconcile. Derek a fae is a hot charasmatic gentleman. Kylie can't help but realize how much he reminds her of Trey. After a steamy kiss she tells him they should be friends because she wasnt sure if she wanted to deal with boys. Then........... Werewolf Lucas a childhood neighbor is at the camp and she is instantly horrified once she recognizes him because of a tragic event during her youth. But...taadaaa she is drawn by his physique and how manly he looks for his age. They share the kiss of the century and well things go downhill. The story was headed to a good direction until the author had Kailey showing deep feelings for every guy in sight. She needed a simmer down pill. Nevertheless, I will read the second book in hopes C.C. Hunter has Kailey in check. ...more It was just...ugh. I hated Kylie. She was a whiner. She whined and whined and whined. Like i get it that some sucky things happened,and that you got stuck this camp with people you don't know, but jeez, get over it! And don't even get me started on the romance. God, this girl is so indecisive, i was surprised she could pick out her own clothes. Like blahblahblahblah Derek is so cute,and he reminds me of Trey,but it would be unfair to kiss him,no matter how much i want to blahblah and me and Luca It was just...ugh. I hated Kylie.
