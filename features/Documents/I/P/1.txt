I\u2019ve known it for years.\u201d \u2014 Harry Potter Most seventeen-year olds don\u2019t view the possibility of an early death as being, well, possible. But then again, most seventeen-year olds haven\u2019t come face-to-face with death almost half a dozen times before their first kiss either. In <+++>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</+++> , the seventh and final installment of the ridiculously popular Harry Potter series, <---A>J.K. Rowling</---A> brilliantly ties up every loose end that she has planted over the last ten years since the very first outing of the series was published in 1997. Truly, Rowling has learned exactly what her fans want and subsequently delivers a book that answers every Potterhead\u2019s questions \u2014 and then some. Not only does Deathly Hallows revisit key places and characters from all of the previous six books, but Rowling even manages to make clever references to previous bits of dialogue from her earlier books. Case in point: near the end of the first Potter book, after Hermione fails to see the magical solution to saving the trio from a nasty patch of Devil\u2019s Snare, Harry\u2019s best mate Ron bellows \u201cHAVE YOU GONE MAD? ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\u201d Now,<---M> six years later</---M>, Hermione finally gets her revenge on her red-headed friend when Ron believes that all is lost until Hermione yells to him \u201cAre you a wizard, or what?\u201d thus reminding Ron to use his wand to solve their problem. Subtle references such as this are a large part of what makes Rowling\u2019s books so enjoyable to re-read as there are always deeper meanings and additional allusions that are often only discovered via multiple read-throughs. Harry\u2019s bold statement regarding his own potential death is also a prime example of how much Rowling truly wrote Harry\u2019s last tale for her long-time fans. This line seems to read as a secret \u201cshout-out\u201d to the Potterites who have also known for years that the series might not end happily ever after. The prophecy in the fifth book revealed that \u201cneither shall live while the other survives\u201d, and therefore by the end of book seven either Harry or Voldemort had to die. Rowling cleverly fills her last installment with so many twists, turns and complications, however, that it becomes practically impossible to determine which way this book is going to end. More than any of the other Potter books, Deathly Hallows is a true quest narrative, with the trio spending the majority of the story hunting for horcruxes and hallows whilst evading capture by Voldemort\u2019s Death Eaters. The multiple close-calls that all three main characters find themselves in throughout the book add to the tension that continues to build until the predictably bloody battle at the end of the tale. The book does, after all, chronicle a brutal war, so be prepared for a lot of killing and, consequently, a lot of tears. This is not to say that Deathly Hallows doesn\u2019t offer up a great deal of laughs as well. The hilarious twins Fred and George Weasley make several appearances to ensure that the book isn\u2019t all doom and gloom. By far, the funniest part of the story is the secret radio show Potterwatch , anonymously hosted by former Hogwarts Quidditch commentator Lee Jordan with special appearances from Fred, George, and ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin. Rowling perfectly mixes this blend of humour, tragedy and adventure so that her epic-length novel never lags or drags. To write a 607 page book that millions of die-hard fans around the world are able to devour in less than 24 hours is no mean feat, but Rowling\u2019s farewell to the Boy Who Lived is an incredibly gripping page-turner that will leave all Potter lovers immensely satisfied. ...more It's hard for me to believe that I finished the Harry Potter series...

The characters are engaging and brilliant, and I love how the plot is so interwoven and twisted within itself, especially in this last book. I was taken by surprise when I started the series, I didn't think it would pull me in as it did. As I kept reading through the books, the characters slyly stole my heart. Now, having finished the last line, I am flooded with emotion. This series is more than a story or words on a page, it is magic. ...more Ok, before I start a few warnings. This will contain spoilers (though since I'm writing this a year after the release I don't think it's too much of a tragedy), it will be long and it will be negative because I really didn't like this book.

This will contain spoilers (though since I'm writing this a year after the release I don't think it's too much of a tragedy), it will be long and it will be negative because I really didn't like this book. Reading books one to five I was very impressed with the storytelling from a novice novellist. There was magic, there were characters you could love, and sure there were some cliche'd storylines, but they were interspersed with really interesting sidestories (Peeves, SPEW, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes). I was enthralled as a teenager and I am enthralled now as an adult when I re-read them. But I have to say the the quality dropped markedly in books six and seven. The ramblings (that started out cute in GoF and OotP) have become pronounced and boring. The characters have lost much of what made them endearing, and the plot has gone to hell. Focusing on Deathly Hallows, I had a very strong feeling that six months before her deadline, JKR went on to the internet, discovered that everyone had guessed her 'twists' (honestly, who didn't know that Harry was an accidental Horcrux, RAB was <---C>Sirius</---C>'s brother, the diadem was at Hogwarts, the locket was at Grimmauld Place, Dumbledore ordered Snape to kill him, Snape was in love with Lily and Ron would be a it and abandon Harry and Hermione?), and felt the need to come up with a new plot device. This would explain the incredible stupidity that is the deathly hallows and the plot holes and gaps in logic that involve them. Now, it has been a while since I read it so some of my names and such might be wrong, and if it does answer the questions in the book in such a round about way I apologise, but the Elder Wand does not make sense. I'm willing to accept that it follows it's own set of rules separate from those of other wands (where Haary can use Hermione's wand almost as well as his own and all of the disarming they did in book five didn't make their wands all change ownerships) but the course of events whereby Harry became the owner of the wand are just plain silly. If Grindelwald simply stole the wand from Gregorovich (sp?), how did that make him the wands owner? If the wand is unbeatable, how did Dumbledore defeat Grindelwald (I know Rita Skeeter theorised that Grindelwald surrended, but how does that pass the wand's ownership to Dumbledore. Surrender is not the same as defeat). And if the wand is unbeatable, why was Dumbledore unable to defeat Voldemort when they dueled on OotP? And also, is Harry really so conceited and stupid to think that no one would ever defeat or disarm him, making them the owner of the wand? Shouldn't he have broken it? If he does become an auror in later life someone is bound to disarm him eventually, and if they knew about the wand, they could easily steal it back from Dumbledore's tomb. The other major thing that ticked me off was the characterisation. Hermione, Harry and Ron have always been some of my favourite characters, but here they are acting completely different from previous books. Harry using Unforgivable curses without a hint of remorse, and not comforting Hermione when Ron takes off, instead staring at a 'Ginny-dot'. Can we say creepy and stalkerish? And Hermione, who for the most part was still loyal and brave and smart (loved the bottomless bag bit, and her being there for Harry at Godric's Hollow), was so pathetic when it came to Ron. I know love makes people do the wacky, but crying for days on end when they're supposed to be searching for Horcruxes, kissing him in the middle of the war because he finally showed a tiny inkling of care towards the house-elves. And Ron. Gah! I mean, I love Ron, but you would have thought he could have grown up a little, just a smidgen. But no, running away because of the locket (one ring to rule them all...). Those who defend him saying it affected him more than Harry or Hermione because he had more insecurities is just dumb. Harry and Hermione had just as much to be insecure about. Harry, with his saving-people-thing, could easily have gone nuts with the locket around his neck and ran away from the others because he was terrified that they'd get killed. And Hermione has always been insecure, about being Muggle-born, about proving herself, about Ron and Harry and their friendships. Sure, he wanted to come back the moment he left, but he still left. Which I could accept were it not for such a stupid reason. And then he got his 'super-moment' which was so lame. Honestly, 'Ron can remember and copy paseltongue', uhuh. Wouldn't it have made much more sense to say, have Ginny come along, who could possibly still say the word from when she opened it under Tom's control in CoS. And then Ron mentioned the house-elves, to make himself 'worthy' (JKR's words, not mine) of Hermione. For one thing, why does he need to make himself 'worthy' since she already loved him for all his insensitivity and insecurity, and why did that 'worthiness' have to be something that Harry already had in abounds? Yes, I am a H/Hr shipper, but that is by no means the reason I hated this book (as you can see from above). If H/Hr had been handled as badly as R/Hr or H/G, I would have hated it. But the fact remains that the most romantic scenes in this book were between Harry and Hermione. At Grimmauld Place when Harry showed Hermione the picture, at the wedding where Hermione beamed at Harry, at Godric's Hollow where they strolled arm in arm under the kissing gate in the snow. While in canon, Harry married Ginny and Ron married Hermione, that will never convince me that they are the better couples. Harry and Hermione had the friendship, the trust, the alchemy. They were the most developed relationship in the series, and the fact that they didn't end up together in the book doesn't change that. The final things I feel like picking on - the epilogue came across as being written by a teenage fangirl. No depth, no meaning, just stupid-named kids. I get that JKR wanted Harry to end the book with the normal family life he never had, it could have been handled so much better. And seriously, Albus Severus? That poor kid must have been teased horribly. And why Severus? Sure, he turned out to be not evil, but for Harry to chance his mind about the man after seven years of abuse and ill treatment just because he was scamming on Lily. It's just gross. And unrealistic. I was so hoping there was more to Snape's story than twenty years of unrequited love. Gah. It may have been a sweet way for him to become not evil, but Lily was very, very dead for a very long time, and no one holds on that hard to love. If caring for her wasn't enough for him to stray away from the dark arts while she was alive, why was it enough when she was dead? Also, the invisibility cloak was supposed to be infallible, and yet Moody saw through it in OotP and Dementor's could see through it in PoA, supposedly. And, my god did the death scene's suck in this book. Yes, its a war so plenty of people, including main characters were going to die, but when I felt worse about Dobby than I did about Remus (who is one of my favourite characters) you just know that the author hasn't put enough emotion into it. He was the last of the Marauders, for god's sake, he deserved an on-page death at the very least. Maybe defending Harry or Tonks. Something! Well, there ends the rant. There were a few good points in the novel (like Godric's Hollow, before the stupidity of Harry not realising that Bathilda was Nagini, and the awesomeness of Neville) but they were few and far between and do not at all make up for the rest of the drivel. Read it because it is the conclusion to a series that took seventeen years to write, but do not expect the fireworks that such a finale could have been. There's better fanfics out there. ...more All was well. This is just a pithy review on the Harry Potter series as a whole.

It is not an in-depth analysis of the work in general, nor is it a review on any one particular installment. Harry Potter is a work of art. I got made fun of once\u00b9 when I was out to dinner with some friends, because while we were discussing these books I made the mistake of referring to them as \u201cliterature.\u201d I felt like I had to defend that assertion because, although the definition of literature is pretty broad, it seems like it should really only apply to works with some definable qualitative value or literary merit. In this case, my friends were wrong\u2014Rowling explores themes and concepts in this series that I think are valuable to children and young adults who look to her characters for qualities they seek to emulate, and I believe her works will have lasting impact on this and future generations. I\u2019ve heard it said before that everything you need to know you\u2019ve learned in kindergarten. Well, that might be somewhat of an oversimplification, but I do think children or young adults who grow into this series, seeing Harry and his friends mature as they themselves mature, can glean some pretty important life lessons from it. They are impressionable human beings who are learning about themselves and are starting to make the choices that reflect the kinds of people they want to be. So what does Harry Potter teach them? Well, here is a bullet list of what it has taught me . And if you\u2019re good, I\u2019ll think about turning this into a PowerPoint presentation. Or maybe not. \u2022 The quality of your character is not a reflection of where you come from or who your parents are; rather, it is a reflection of the choices you make, so make them wisely. \u2022 The way you treat other people, especially those less fortunate than you, reveals your true colors more quickly and more completely than almost anything else you do. \u2022 It is a good thing to have dreams and ambitions, but that alone is not enough. You cannot expect success without effort. \u2022 It is far less important what your abilities are than what you actually do with them. Your abilities alone do not define you. \u2022 Nobody likes to fail, but to refuse an attempt at success on the grounds that you\u2019re afraid to fail is failure in itself. Growing up is about figuring out who you are and coming to terms with your strengths and weaknesses, and it is about deciding how to utilize the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses in order to become a better person. It\u2019s a lifelong struggle, but it starts early, and I think Harry Potter offers the tools to help achieve that. It can help young people find their way, and maybe that\u2019s an oversimplification for a seven-volume series of novels, but that\u2019s what I got out of it, and that\u2019s why I will recommend this to my kids as they start to become ready for some life lessons of their own. \u00b9This is misleading; I\u2019ve been made fun of countless, countless times. ...more Sigh...

If you Stuck With Harry Until The Very End. I've been stuck with Harry myself for 10 years now..when I first read the Arabic edition of the 1st book on Sep.2003.. I felt how it's different than the movie,The characters more alive ,forcing you to feel that they're your friends, like you're already living with them in the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,it was like my other Home I finished the series in Arabic and start it in English 2 years ago,It was still fresh and as thrilling, emotional ,great as ever. Here I'll try to stick to review that part of the series only ,till I write more about the experince of living The Harry Potter Saga The Plot ******** Remember before book 7 release how were we been feeling? **Harry still got 4 Horcruxes to find -and even to know what it'll be- and even how to destroy it. **And then Fight the 7th Part of the shuttered soul...Voldemort himself, his Death Eaters and the traitor Snape. **How he can do all that without Dumbledore , Black and all of those he can't tell about his quest as Dumbledore ask him to not tell but to Ron and Hermione. We all thought it will be difficult to fit it all in one last volume ,and to wrap up characters and events. But the amazing plot of that book didn't only fit for that all. and also add a new element \"The Deathly Hallows\" and fit it perfectly into the full story.. I can't believe how that book fit everything we're all been asking about since the very early beginning ,and some of the facts that anyone wondered about like How the trace dedicate the underage magic, Why we can't just create food from thin air, or why there was a Taboo on saying \"Voldemort\"'s name..and so more. It dive deeply into the past of important characters we thought we know enough , Dumbledore and Snape. From the beginning you see a wrapping up for the characters,the places -like Private Drive- and the events.. you'll see a lines that connected to the very early of the series and book one..you'll be in a journey toward the ending without feeling disconnected from the whole previous events and characters. There's no something you'll feel-if u pay enough attention - out of place ,out of the plot or out of the characters . The Characters ************** Was so glad that J.K.Rowling announce that there's no \"new\" character presented in the last books which was perfect since it's the end of the series and it's better to focus on our beloved characters and the ones we lived wit them for years. The characters deals here with the \"real responsibilities\" that comes with the coming of age. or the quest they asked for and they have to do for their good and greater good There were no any \"Exaggeration\" or over acting, the characters go normally ,naturally and very real, The writer chose to describe even the smallest feelings they feel in some important situations like for example Harry's final visit to the Dark Forest, or the boredom of the days on the run from place to place. And won't forget the wrapping up of Every character sometimes with surprises which is never out of character. She was always have it all planned and well drawn The Message *********** I have to admit at my second reading I find an extraordinary spiritual amazing message It starts with the 2 quotations one is pagan, and one is from a Christian tradition.. one about the Death and one about Friends.. and it fit perfectly to the theme of the book,and the message of Love that can beat any other force. I saw also a symbol in the Dumbledore's character and the whole Harry -Dumbledore's relation, complicated symbol of Faith, religion and religious people. in many ways that you have to look carefully to dedicate it. \u0650\u0650And look at the final fight between Harry and Voldemort ..I was like..My God you're the best writer EVER \u201cYou\u2019re right. But before you try to kill me, I\u2019d advise you to think about what you\u2019ve done. . . . Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle. . . .\u201d \u201cWhat is this?\u201d Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this. Harry saw his pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten. \u201cIt\u2019s your one last chance,\u201d said Harry, \u201cit\u2019s all you\u2019ve got left. . . . I\u2019ve seen what you\u2019ll be otherwise. . . . Be a man . . . try . . . Try for some remorse. . . .\u201d It's not just normal fight between Good and Evil , It's amazing written novel. Can't seriously describe all of what I want to say about this series Just one thing I can admit, It's my wonderful journey, It's my friends, It's the books that made me- trying to be- a better person. It's where I meet my friends.. It's where I truly Laugh while reading/living the story..It's where I cry with characters and feel sorry for some. It's magic..It's real magic cause It's words of Love So glad to finish it at 2nd May, And so strange I didn't feel I'm going to miss the Harry Potter books although I finished it before in Arabic, and that was the ending of my experience with it in English, But deep inside me is sure I'll go back to Hogwarts again ,re-reading from one to seven soon ISA. Before I finish I have to share this great man's word..Who really was the best transforming a paper character to a real life Thank you Joanna Rowling. Mohammed Arabey 16 April 2013 2 May 2013 \"Harry Potter International Day\"** **On That Day 2nd May 1998 ,The Battle of Hogwarts and Lord Voldemort's downfall .

Fir Wheeeeeere do I even start with this? WHERE. Every human and their bobcat has reviewed this book, but I'M GONNA ANYWAY BECAUSE MY THOUGHTS ARE IMPORTANT. (I am also a Slytherin, FYI.) I'm also really angry because I'm giving it 5-stars because it's so freaking clever . But I've got complaints. But HECK. Life is short. Eat dessert first. Give books 5-stars. But I feel emotionally manipulated by this sneaky paperback, DARN YOU HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS. MY LOVE FOR YOU IS COMPLICATED. First: let's talk about why Cait is a Grumpy Gills: \u2022 The fact that the pacing is rubbish. Sorry?! But it kind of is. The beginning borderlines B.O.R.I.N.G. Not enough that I wasn't interested? But enough that I was annoyed. It felt like JK Rowling didn't know what to do with her characters if they didn't have Hogwarts classes to get to. \u2022 I'm annoyed that the Slytherins were still labelled at the end as \"badies\". C'mon. Honestly?! Especially in that epilogue when (view spoiler) [Ron (hide spoiler) ] says \"don't make friends with Slytherins, kids!\" I mean. Rubbish and growls. (I am a defensive Slytherin, FYI.) \u2022 And speaking of Slytherin's...I kind of thought Harry and Draco might've (view spoiler) [made up or something?? Been tentative friends????? BUT NO??!?! (hide spoiler) ] Apparently all the stuff I'd gleaned from the internet is wishful thinking. Heh. \u2022 There was VERY cliche Voldemort-must-monologue-before-his-kill scene. \u2022 To be realistic...Harry should've passed out from FOOD DEPRIVATION. Why is not one angry about this?!? The lad barely EVER ATE. I was hungry reading this blasted book. Someone give the kid a scone before he kills a thing. \u2022 I'm annoyed Luna and Neville didn't get more page time. REALLY annoyed. \u2022 I still don't ship the ships. In bk6 I was totally onboard with Harry and Ginny. But now? Meh. They like have no chemistry, sorry. And Hermione and Ron? LET. ME. LAUGH. No. Still...no. Though Ron did mature a lot in this book and I am proud. ...okay. My wrath is out. Now time for the FEEEEEEELS. Don't say I didn't warn you. EVERYTHING I FREAKING LOVED AND THE REASONS THIS BOOK IS GETTING 5 FREAKING STARS OMG FEELELLELELELELS: \u2022 My darling baby Neville Longbottom. No joke. I HAD A DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT. (I have not seen any movies, btw.) But my motorbike had broken down and he came and fixed it for me and it was adorable and my heart melted. I want a Neville Longbottom, please and thank you. MY CRUSH. <333 (Note: I do not own a motorbike. Nor would I want to. I would probably die on it, geesh, brain, where are you coming up with this stuff?) \u2022 The plot is clever. Okay seriously IT IS CLEVER. I loved how things tied in and tied up and I loved all the \"reveals\" and it was just clever . \u2022 And the world building is my favourite as always. I want to live a Hogwarts. BUT DOESN'T EVERYBODY? \u2022 Professor MacGonagall. Because she gives life. She is everything. All my love for Professor MacGonagall and her terrific dialogue lines, okay? \u201cOur Headmaster is taking a short break,\" said Professor McGonagall, pointing at the Snape-shaped hole in the window. \u2022 I love Harry. I really do. Like at the end there, he was almost a little too perfect, which was boderline irritating? But he is a precious little piece of pumpkin juice and I LOVE how he makes mistakes and sometimes needs slapping with a broomstick, but at the end of the day he's just a GOOD KID. Likey. \u2022 Obviously Hermione. <3 And I'm glad Ron grew up a lot in this book, because gee that kid was 3 centimetres away from getting his nose punched by moi. \u2022 I hate hate hate hatttttte when the word \"bitch\" is used in a derogatory way towards women. But. There was this scene with Molly Weasley and Bellatrix LeStrange = and I liked it. YOU KNOW THE ONE, FOLKS. \u2022 Snape. Omg. Snape. I do agree that his a very complex character and I LIKE that. But I still hate him. Why? Because he could've done EVERYTHING just how he needed too -- sans bully children. I get why he hated Harry. I would've hated Harry if James had been like that (question: why the hell did Lily marry James?!??! Seriously?! HE SUCKED) but Neville?! Why did Snape pick on Neville so bad? He literally traumatised my darling baby and I shall not forgive him. I do not \"like\" Snape but I like the complexity of his story. And I kind of wish there as a book about Snape. His backstory seemed too rushed. \u2022 THE DEATHS. <3 Okay that sounds marginally sadistic. But hear me out. I hate when big battle finales keep all the \"favourites\" alive. It's dumb and unrealistic. There need to be deaths, and I think HPatDH did it really well. I got all tied up in knots several times. SNIFFLES. \u2022 I love Luna. She is an amazing special creature and I wish she was in the books more. \u2022 Speaking of which...I have to admire how ALL the characters are just so epic. I would seriously read spin-off series on anyone of them. THAT takes skill to write even secondary characters so the reader is invested. \u2022 I LIKED IT EVEN THOUGH IT KINDA MANGLED FEELS AND IT FRUSTRATED ME. But it surprised me! When I thought I'd seen all the spoilers of ever. And I was emotionally invested. Omg. I WAS. \u2022 (No tears though. I am a Vulcan.) *** ABOUT THAT EPILOGUE *** Okay but, spoilers about the finale below. (view spoiler) [I am twitchy about the finale. I thought there'd be more. All we know is who married who and how many kids they had and what STUPID names they gave their children. And Harry's son James is basically Harry's father reincarnated. Does that not disturb anyone? *raises hand* But what did Harry and Ginny do? Like did they get a Killed Voldemort Pesnion and get to retire? Did Harry become an Auror? Why the HECK didn't he get to teach in school? I think he'd been an awesome Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Did Lunar and Neville marry? Or did Neville save himself for me? What did George do, sans Fred? Like, could George exist without a Fred? Why did Hermione settle so low when she married Ron? What happened to Kreecher? I want to hug Kreecher. I also want him to bring me a sandwich too. Did Professor MacGonagall stay in school to teach or did she scream when she saw Harry's children and say \"I QUIT\"? ....I am kind of angry there are no answers to these. Let me huff. (hide spoiler) ] Aaaaand...I'M DONE. What else do I say? Yes. I loved it. YES. I love this series. I had a rocky start, and I thought it was dumb. But seriously? If I'd been reading this as a kid. I would been obsessed. OBSESSED. As is, I really want to own the books just for the sake of it because they're good and they're amazing and they deserve the world-wide cult fandom. It's a satisfying and grand and perfectly wretched finale and I should like to cheer enthusiastically. Omg, look at me. I'm a little HP fangirl. IT'S OVER FOR ME. I'VE REACHED THE POINT OF NO RETURN. \u201cOf course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?\u201d (Also that quote means so much to me I cannot even.) ...more (So I never did a review of this and am deciding to add one now.) I'm a Millennial, and like most Millennials, I grew up with Harry Potter. Not just the books, but we kinda aged with him (or thereabouts). It's a coming of age story for our whole generation, whether or not we received our Hogwarts letters. And we were there together. We were at midnight release parties and movie theaters, lined up and excited to share in the adventure. I can't think of the number of people who I've bonded with over (So I never did a review of this and am deciding to add one now.)

I can't think of the number of people who I've bonded with over these stories--people who I wouldn't have thought to have much in common with in the first place. We came from all different backgrounds, much like the 4 houses, and joined in the Battle of Hogwarts. We mourned the deaths of beloved characters. And cheered on the sheer wit and bravery of others. We debated what Harry should have done with the Elder Wand. But we never let go of this world. We continue to relive these memories through fan fiction, arts and crafts, music, food and drink, and theme parks .

You still have time to back out though, so don\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t been warned.^^ To J.K. Rowling , there is no argument about your brilliance. You are a certified genius, a person with superhuman writing ability and imagination and I can\u2019t praise you enough for writing these books that have forever changed my life. But you\u2019re still human and surely you\u2019ve recognized your flaws. One of which is your penchant for killing your characters. You can\u2019t blame me for thinking that one of the reasons you created so many great and memorable characters is for you to be able to kill as many of them as you want to. I accept though with the heaviest heart that certain characters needed to die, needed to sacrifice their lives for the greater good but I find no good reason for the death of (view spoiler) [Fred! (hide spoiler) ] . Why? Why kill him? Haven\u2019t you killed enough already? Why did he even have to die?! Why not Percy instead? (kidding). I honestly think no Weasley should have died for obvious reasons I don\u2019t think I still have to enumerate. Also, I honestly believe the last book lacks at least 200 more pages. Why jump to 19 years later epilogue right after the devastating war? Don\u2019t the rest of the other characters deserve a few pages about them? A simple tribute perhaps to all their sacrifice and pain and loss? I have gone so far, have read hundreds and hundreds of pages from book one only to be spared of better resolutions before an epilogue. Also, don\u2019t you think (view spoiler) [Professor Severus Snape (hide spoiler) ] deserved a better, more respectful way to die? And whatever happened to (view spoiler) [Professor Moody\u2019s (hide spoiler) ] body? So you see, even though I admire you with 99.72 percent of my heart, .28 percent percent is resenting your choices. But thank you. Now my heart is tougher and braver. Characters in the next books I read could all die and I probably wouldn\u2019t shed a tear. I just wish I read your books before Allegiant and Mockingjay . I probably would have considered those happy endings. To Harry Potter , I will never forget your brave and pure heart. You showed me that heroes can be an average boy with no special superpowers except courage, trustworthy instincts and strength of will, oh and of course, a bunch of awesome wizards and witches supporting and protecting him the best way they can. To Hermione Granger , you are the most kick-ass heroine I\u2019ve ever met without needing to actually kick ass. You only needed your intellect, level headedness and kind heart and like Ron said, without you and your beaded bag, he and Harry would not have survived a day during your quest. To Ron Weasley , you probably are the biggest idiot in the story but you showed the best of you in times you are needed the most. I admire your loyalty, sarcasm and free spirit and there is no better man for Hermione than you. To Fred and George , when in tears, I could always count on you guys for a good laugh. It's no fun without you. (view spoiler) [George, it\u2019s hard enough losing a part of your body but to have to lose your twin brother too. Oh Gaaaaawd! *wails* (hide spoiler) ] To Hagrid (and Graupy) , *hugs* I\u2019ll never forget your gallons of tears and rock cakes! Thank you for your loyalty, friendship and bravery. You will be remembered for generations. To Professor Snape, you are indeed the bravest of them all. Your sacrifice is utterly selfless and certainly the biggest of all. Your memories Harry and I saw in Dumbledore\u2019s Pensieve ripped my heart to pieces and I spent days and nights crying for you. You're a true hero and you deserve a monument. Maybe I'll name my son after you. *wails* To Professor Dumbledore , you are the true epitome of sacrifice, love and humility. You find something good in every person and you never fail to offer kindness even to those others deem undeserving. To Dumbledore\u2019s Army led by Neville, Luna, Ginny, , you guys are awesome! To the Order of the Phoenix, you were amazing especially you Mrs. Weasley! I\u2019m so sorry for your losses but thank you, thank you so much. To the Hogwarts Professors led by Prof. Mc Gonagall , you did an amazing job holding off Voldy! You were all brilliant! To the Malfoys, uh I don\u2019t know. How about I just stick my tongue out at the lot of you! To Dobby, *wails* I can\u2019t\u2026just thank you so much. You\u2019re the most loyal elf. The bravest free elf I know. To Kreacher, you poor thing. I had no idea what you had to go through and what made you the way you are. In the end, thank you for your bravery and for leading the elves to the battle. To the Death Eaters and Snatchers led by Bellatrix and Greyback , I have two words for you. \u201cAVEDA KEDAVRA!\u201d To Umbridge, off to Azkaban, you go! To Voldemort , that\u2019s right, I dare! I am completely with Harry, You don\u2019t learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you? To the rest of the fallen, (view spoiler) [Professor Moody, Cedrick, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, James and Lily, Colleen Creevey and many others (hide spoiler) ] , like Neville said, your death was not in vain. Thank you! *wails* To the movie makers and actors , thank you for bringing to life the characters we love. We will always look up to you people. Don't you dare disappoint us!^^ To my Goodreads friends who bullied me into reading Harry Potter, thank you for destroying my life! I was doing perfectly fine without these books. You wrecked me pretty bad especially when I was reading the last book. I felt like hundreds of Dementors were surrounding me while reading it that I had to constantly cast a Patronus Charm while reading. It was really exhausting. My Patronus is a baby elephant, btw! Oh and I'm House Gryffindor, hurray! I'm afraid, I'm becoming worse than Luna Lovegood. To Jia and Kyra , HAPPY BIRTHDAY, my young, smart and beautiful friends (March 06 is their actual birthday). You are both gifted for having such passion for reading at such young ages. Savor that gift and seize your most special day! <3 ...more REVIEW TO COME TOMORROW 'Do not Pity the dead, Harry.

I feel like I just bought the first book yesterday instead of months ago. I feel like I just read the first book yesterday instead of months ago. Months ago, I thought I would feel okay when I finished this series but I do not feel that way. I feel ... like empty or hollow on the inside, you know what I mean, right? like there is this sad feeling and you just want to read it forever and ever but you can't because the story is over and there is nothing you can do. the only thing you can do is hugging the book because that way you would feel much better, like you actually hug the main characters. maybe this is how it feels like when you have to say goodbye to your best friends who have always be with you. no matter how difficult the situation is but they are there. I always envy those people who grew up with Harry Potter series. I envy them because they have such incredible childhood and me, I was a muggle that time and I used to hate reading novels so much and I had never once thought that I would love reading novels as much as I love breathing. Harry Potter series also has a great impact in my life. I was the kind of girl who always shy and never be myself because before reading HP I wanted people to like me, so I became what they wanted me to be and I rarely stood up for myself even when I knew I was right but Harry Potter series has changed me. you guys do know Luna, don't you? many people called her \" Loony \" because she believed in many things but Luna didn't care what they called her, she kept being herself and she had never ashamed to show her true self and that was the time I realized I was such a stupid girl who let my so-called friends changed me to be the girl I didn't even want me to be and now, my friends often say that I am such a weirdo or crazy girl who is very different from them because I love reading books so much and you know what? I just don't care about them anymore. I don't care when they say about me such a weirdo because I am not ashamed of being myself anymore because this is who I am and Luna also taught me one more thing, when you are being yourself and everyone teases you because of it. don't you ever worry about it because your true friends will come to you. these friends will accept who you are. Just like Luna who has amazing friends, Harry Ron, Ginny, Hermione and Neville. like I told you, I used to be very shy that I never stood up for even myself. few weeks ago, my friend who always insulted me, she insulted me again and no one in class was brave enough to stand up for themselves. the next thing I knew was that I snapped back at her and she was shocked and she has never insulted me again since that accident and she is kind of nice to me and we're friends now. This series has changed me to be a braver person. I don't think I can say this is a review because it's all about me and one more thing,, (view spoiler) [ I will never ever forget 2nd May 1998. I lost so many great friends Remus, Tonks, Colin, Fred, Sirius and many more. (hide spoiler) ] I really want to say many thank you to Mrs. J. K.

The wizarding naturalist Luna Lovegood, the eccentric Ravenclaw who was fascinated with Crumple-Horned Snorkacks and Umgubular Slashkilters, continues to march to the beat of her own drum. \u201cI think that Luna is now traveling the world looking for various mad creatures,\u201d Rowling said. \u201cShe\u2019s a naturalist, whatever the wizarding equivalent of that is.\u201d Luna comes to see the truth about her father, eventually acknowledging there are some creatures that don\u2019t exist. \u201cBut I do think that she\u2019s so open-minded and just an incredible person that she probably would be uncovering things that no one\u2019s ever seen before,\u201d Rowling said. Luna and Neville Longbottom? It\u2019s possible Luna has also found love with another member of the D.A. When she was first asked about the possibility of Luna hooking up with Neville Longbottom several years ago, Rowling\u2019s response was \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d But as time passed and she watched her characters mature, Rowling started to \u201cfeel a bit of a pull\u201d between the unlikely pair. Ultimately, Rowling left the question of their relationship open at the end of the book because doing otherwise \u201cfelt too neat.\u201d Mr. and Mrs. Longbottom: \u201cThe damage is done.\u201d There is no chance, however, that Neville\u2019s parents, who were tortured into madness by Bellatrix Lestrange, ever left St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital for Magical Maladies. \u201cI know people really wanted some hope for that, and I can quite see why because, in a way, what happens to Neville\u2019s parents is even worse than what happened to Harry\u2019s parents,\u201d Rowling said. \u201cThe damage that is done, in some cases with very dark magic, is done permanently.\u201d Rowling said Neville finds happiness in his grandmother\u2019s acceptance of him as a gifted wizard and as the new herbology professor at Hogwarts. The fate of Hogwarts Nineteen years after the Battle of Hogwarts, the school for witchcraft and wizardry is led by an entirely new headmaster (\u201cMcGonagall was really getting on a bit\u201d) as well as a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. That position is now as safe as the other teaching posts at Hogwarts, since Voldemort\u2019s death broke the jinx that kept a Defense Against the Dark Arts professor from remaining for more than a year.

It's crazy how much time I spend reading the books, listening to the audiobooks, watching the films or just thinking about them. So many things between thousands of pages and millions of words. No wonder Harry Potter has such an impact on our society, as it deals with so many topics that have moved, and still move us today, will move us in future: Race and racism for one, hate, ignorance, arrogance and how to fight all of these things. Power and influence of the media, slavery, dictatorship, revolution, feminism, depression, death, loss, equality, love, friendship. J. K. Rowling is probably one of the most important teachers to every child (and adult) reading her books. She shows us, that our dreams are dreamed to become real, that family is who we chose our family to be, that friends can be our greatest strength and that every being, whatever our differences might be, deserves kindness and respect. I still can't believe that this amazing woman was able to put all of this in seven books. Thank you.

The book begins with Harry, Ron and Hermione on the run doing the task that Dumbledore gave Harry. To be honest, the first part of the book (and by first part, I mean the first 70-80% or so) was a little slow for me. There were exciting things to pop up here and there, but a lot of it was slow. Then the last few hours of the audiobook happened. I\u2019ve gotta say, once this trio got back to Hogwarts, the ending was epic. There were moments of sorrow, moments that made me laugh, smile, cry\u2026 it was very emotional (view spoiler) [GAWD that Snape scene.\u2026 I can\u2019t even! It made me cry like a baby.

It was still unknown except to a vast population of younglings who'd read it... and I fell in love. Oh, how I fell in love. I fell in love with the poor, starved-for-affection, later known to be a twit Harry. I fell in love with the pretentious know-it-all Hermione. I fell in love with the awkward, grew-up-in-his-brother's-shadows Ron... and most of all? I fell in love with the snarky, unplatable, snarling, rude, hygienically-disinclined professor of potions, Severus Snape. Almost ten years later, I'm still obsessed with it in many ways. This is the Seventh Book. This is the end of Harry Potter. I cried, I wept, I laughed, sometimes quite hysterically. And overall? I loved it. I loved Ron's humour, Harry's angst, Hermione's smarts, Snape's devotion, Dumbledore's love, Percy's return, Dobby's sacrifice, the change of Kreacher, absolutely everything . I kept waiting and waiting to be disappointed and yes, I was disappointed on the occasion, but the thrill far outweighed the flaws. As for Snape? One of the characters I fell absolutely in love with? THIS IS A HUGE SPOILER . Snape... ... ... ... ... ... Snape dies. He dies working for Dumbledore. He dies, looking into Harry's eyes. He dies because for the last thirty years of his life, he has loved Lily Evans and everything he has done and everything he sacrificed was for her. His death provoked a number of emotions in me and one of the major ones was utter, utter grief. He's been abused and used his whole life, whether by his parents, by his classmates, by Voldemort, by Dumbledore, and I felt such freaking anger that in the end, he wasn't even given the proper funeral that he totally deserved. In the book itself, it made sense, because whatever Snape did for the Greater Good, he was still a bastard. But as a reader, my heart broke into ittybitty pieces over him. There were tons of other things going on at the same time. I say, Rowling is an excellent action scene writer. I'm terrible at writing action that's vivid and engaging, but she managed to do it. Harry himself lives. But he's been forever scarred by his experience. And that, actually, is one of the best parts of his book. He was such an arse in books 5 and 6, and to have this mature young man emerge was one of the greatest joys in this series. I was so, so, so happy that he got the happiness he wanted. The ending was much WTF? for me, since it was like a SOOPER HAPPILY EVER AFTER ending, but at the same time... Harry is finally happy and that means a great deal to me. Well. Harry, I've been a fan for almost ten years and in those ten years, you've made me laugh, cry, scream, whoop, run around, obsess, tender, hard, awesome and about a million other things. I've watched you grow from a scared, unsure first year into a hopeful young man in the third and fourth, an angsty teen in the fifth and sixth, and in the seventh? You came full circle and you were as your parents were. Happy, with children of your own. You changed so much and it felt like I had grown up partly with you, though I was but fourteen years old when I read you. I love all of the characters, I love all the books, and well? R.I.P. Severus Snape. You'll be missed. Same with you, Fred, Dobby, Lupin, Tonks, Moody, Colin, Scrimgoeur, Bellatrix, Peter, yes, even Voldemort. A lifetime has passed and HP is going to be one of those books that'll stay with me forever. So... peace out, Harry! You deserve out! ...more \u201cDo not pity the dead, Harry.

It wasn't. I was VERY disappointed with the last portion of the book. But the criticisms are for later. I've always thought that JK's writing was admirable if a little underdeveloped, but the paragraphs just don't seem to flow together as well as they used to. They finally leave school. I never thought they would, but it sure as hell was an exciting notion. However the lack of supporting characters (that you might find at Hogwarts) means that grrr. *spoilers* This book was meant to be a masterpiece. It wasn't.

I never thought they would, but it sure as hell was an exciting notion. However the lack of supporting characters (that you might find at Hogwarts) means that this book is darker and the lack of humour makes for a depressing hundred pages around pg200. The deaths... a little weird how the human deaths are less effective, maybe that's just me but Hedwig and Dobby's deaths broke my heart. With mad-eye... well, he was an asshole so i didn't care. With Fred... well, there is another one so the impact is lessened. With Lupintonks... well if they were stupid enough to name Harry godfather (even THEY should have seen the parellalism!) then they deserve to die. No i don't mean that, but as we didn't see them die it seems less horrifying. So much more interesting and original than the others this daring new direction led to some bad writing which didn't go anywhere in the end (wtf was the hallows about?). The Hallows was a ridiculous idea and frankly i was horrified that Rowling was attempting to introduce such a 'major' theme in the last book with only one brief reference in book six. They were pointless, in the end what did it matter who had ownership of the elder wand? no one used it in 'the final duel' anyway. I no longer like Dumbledore, JK dragged him through the mud and didn't thoroughly wash him off. Harry forgave him but i sure as hell didn't (and who didn't see the 'Harry is a Horcrux' thing coming? The chapter 'King's cross' made me cry. But not because it was well written, rather the opposite, it didn't make sense at times (where the hell were they?) i had to reread the section on harry's 'phoenixlike' ability several times and i still hate it. It was so weak. This sequence was nothing like the other 'endofbookharryanddumbledore' explanations we have come to know and love. Nothing was explained in this chapter everything was re-explained and slightly embellished. The chapters immediately preceding this were the real treat of the book, Snape is finally redeemed (although after ten years of waiting i did expect a better ironclad reason for trusting him than loving lily). Harry facing his mortality is heartbreaking even though most of us have imagined it countless times. The moment right before his death is about as perfect an HP moment there is. He should have stayed dead and the narration flick to another. Voldemort's Invincible Army is defeated too easily and Bellatrix's death is unsatisfying as Molly has no real motive for revenge (nono Fred's death doesn't count). Harry should have done it. He also should have performed at least one killing curse in the book, he performed the other unforgivables, so why not? Voldemort is killed by a reflecting spell. What? WHAT? Are you KIDDING me? Could it possibly be more anticlimactic? What was the point of the elder wand then? Why the elaborate buildup when Harry doesn't even perform the execution? Anyone could have duelled to a reflection, and since when can that happen? A true HP fan must take alot on faith to enjoy this ending. The less said about the epilogue the better. Probably been written since book one and it shows. There is no depth, any hp fan could guess (or assume) this ending, its not even worth reading. Albus Severus was the only icing on this unsatisfying and dry cake. If you do read this book close it at the end of 'the forest again' and write your own ending. OR wait for JK to realise her mistake and re publish with an alternate ending. This was not a rant. Update: Look. I gave it four stars okay? ...more In all honesty I am for once in my life simply lost for words. This DESTROYED me.

I cried, I laughed, I screamed, I smiled, and when it was all over I just sat there and contemplated what my life will be like now that I have finished the series once more. I highly recommend this series more than anything else in the world to those who need some magic in their lives, which is virtually everyone. Love conquers all, and without delving too much into spoilers, that is where I will leave this. Please pick up this series if you have not, I promise it will not disappoint. This next portion is a little bit into my history with Harry Potter, to better understand how I come up with my thoughts about this series. The first time I read the Harry Potter series I was 13 years old. Now, that may seem a bit older than most when they started reading this miraculous series, but I was skeptical to the power that these books had on so many. Although I was older than most when I first read this series, I was also still pretty young and could really only relate to Harry and the others up to about the third book, Prisoner of Azkaban, when they were 13, like I was. Now, exactly five years later, I have been every age (other than in '19 Years Later'), that Harry, Hermione, and Ron have been throughout the entire series, which I think benefits me greatly in understanding their thoughts, feelings, and decisions in each book. When I first read the books, I knew that I could never love anything more, and now, five years later, I am even more sure that this series will not only stay with me forever, bring me light in my darkest days, and be passed on to my children, but also that I have not felt this way about anything. It might seem silly, but I think when one finds this in something, they know, whether or not others will understand. I will most certainly be rereading this series in the future many more times and will continue to be astounded with the growth that I see in myself as I get older, but also with this series, because as I change, it changes with me. It would be a dishonour to give this anything less than 5 stars! Infinity out of 5! ...more This is the fourth time I read this particular book and this time I listened to the audiobook narrated by Stephen Fry and IT WAS AMAZING <3 Around the Year in 52 Books Challenge Notes - 38.

Rowling is not at all shy about killing her characters, especially good ones. George R.R. Martin often gets all the slack for doing this but despite Harry Potter's author saying that she feels bad about killing good people, a great number of them died in the series (and outside it if you start counting from Harry's parents). Some of these deaths are still as tragic on the second time around. Harry's gradual discovery of Dumbledore as not-quite-good-guy is brilliant. It took me two reads to grasp all the nuances of this. Now for the bad parts which unfortunately made me reduce otherwise perfect rating by one star. Ron - to use his favorite word - is a git, especially in this book. He was destined to remain forever in Harry's shadow, but this is exactly the place he deserved. He did not do anything exciting on his own since fated chess match in the first (!) book. As a character Ginny Weasley cannot be even compared to Luna Lovegood, not to mention Hermione Granger. If Harry could not get Hermione, I hoped he ended up with Luna - sure she is loony at times, but she is always understanding, brave, and smart; read carefully her parts if you do not believe me. She was able to help Harry more than Ginny whose only help was kissing him a couple of times. The forest sequence of the book was way too long. This is probably the only part of the series which felt drown out. The whole epilogue feels off. I understand the need to show happily ever after but it still feels out of place. So as I mentioned with these complaints I have to reduce the rating by one, reluctantly. The whole series however deserved unconditional perfect rating. If you have not read it because you think this is for children or because it is too mainstream, or because you think it offends your religious beliefs - get off your high horse and head to your nearest library for the magical experience. ...more What a wonderful ride this has been.

Of course, we get to skip the first one that ended in the death of Dumbledore's sister, but who knows, we will probably be seeing no only Dumbledore but perhaps some Pensives. :) Such delicious stories to pick up soon with the sequels to Fantastic Beasts, no? Especially since we get such a nice close-up of our favorite villain! Just what is the connection between the Obscurials and the Deatheaters, anyway? Oddly suspicious, no? And Ariana Dumbledore? I really need to know how Grindelwald's darkness leads to the informing of Voldemort's powers. :) Okay! Maybe I really ought to talk about the book? I liked it better this time than the first time. A lot. It helps to have EXPLANATIONS over the movies, no matter how pretty all the action scenes are. :) It sounds like a recurring theme, no? Well, there are things that books do so much better than any other medium, and when it comes to UNDERSTANDING, it's peerless. I didn't nearly get so annoyed at the absolutely nothing happening sections in the tale, either, unlike in the movie, because I was actually invested in all those little side characters this time. I wanted to know what was on the radio. It's kinda odd, no? The worst parts the first time around turn out to be some of the best if you CARE. :) Well, this time, I did, and I guess that's what makes a fanboy. Or a Potterhead. No? ...more \u201cDo not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.\u201d The last stand. Holy shit, this was definitely one of the best books I've ever read. It was interesting to the core and never bored me for even a second. This was through and through a pain in the ass. It pained me to read the last chapter, the last book. I didn't want this to end. Still don't want to. (view spoiler) [Fred, Dora, Lupin... Snape... (hide spoiler) ] Why is Mrs. Rowling so keen on killing? Holy \u201cDo not pity the dead, Harry.

My heart shatters every time someone dies, I'm emotional and a cry-baby just like that. There were moments in the book when it reminded me how fun it all used to be. No matter how morbid it all becomes, Mrs. Rowling always manages to keep some things intact, like the humor. The humor is definitely reduced but not non-existent. I laughed so hard when Molly Weasley screamed \"NOT MY DAUGHTER YOU BITCH!\" at Bellatrix (view spoiler) [and then killed her. (hide spoiler) ] How can you not love Mum Weasley? She is mama bear. She'd protect her cubs at all costs. The Epilogue is such an emotional thing. It wrecks your soul and then it puts it all back together... James. Albus Severus. Lily. Hugo. Rose. I was crying because it just occurred to me that Harry, Ron and Hermione were like 11 in the first book and ended up having kids and being in their late 30's which at this point I had lost my shit and crying and did not know what to do with myself. \u201cOf course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?\u201d I just want to say that Harry Potter taught me to be brave and love rather than hate and not being afraid of even dying for those I love. Harry chose to be the better man and he defeated Voldemort not with power but with bravery and courage that only love can armor you with. He fought with friends by his side. Loved ones. ...more", "Title": "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"},
