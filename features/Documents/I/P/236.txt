Hurry up, October!!!!!!! =P I heard somewhere that this was going to be a FIVE book series like Percy Jackson. Does anyone know for sure?? When is the OFFICIAL COVER GOING TO BE RELEASED??? I REALLY WANT TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!!!!! =) ======================================================================= Wow.<---F> The cover is amazing </---F>. It makes me even more excited about this book!!!! I also read the first chapter, and although it was kind of weird at first because it was written in third person, it was from Percy's view! I can't wait to see what adventures are in store!! ================================================================ Aw, this is so cool, I first started writing this a whole year ago! Now I have finally read it, yay! First off, I missed Leo!!! One reason was because he brought so much comic relief, which you need in a book like this! Son of Neptune was a lot more serious than the Lost Hero and all the Percy Jackson books. I liked seeing Nico but I wanted more of him! Same with Thalia and ANNABETH. What did I think of the three main characters? Hazel. Right away I loved her. She was such a three dimensional character that was easy to read about. Frank. Eh...I'm still not quite sure. By the end of the book, I was thinking, \"I don't like him because he outshines my Percy!\" Now though I guess he's okay. I like him and he is slowing growing on me. Percy. Of course, I missed him!!! I loved his chapters!!!! All in all though, the book was pretty good. I will probably be adding things to this review as I remember them. Now I just have to wait a excruciating long year for MARK OF ATHENA, yes Annabeth!! ...more 3.5/5 This was my least favorite of the Percy Jackson books so far. I think that the story is definitely heading in an interesting direction, but I just wasn't feeling it in this one. It has taken me several tries over the months to even get through it. I thought that, except for Percy, the characters were a little bland and I didn't care as much about the Roman camp and their mythology as much as the Greek. I'm not saying that it was bad, I loved Percy and his sass and all of the jokes, just not 3.5/5 This was my least favorite of the Percy Jackson books so far.

SO much better than the Lost Hero. I felt more connected to the characters, and PERCY!!! He was in the book. I was seriously missing him! All of his wit and snarky comments were back, along with a whole bunch of ADORABLE thoughts about Annabeth, as he regains his memory. Definately one of my favorites!! Now I need the MArk of Athena!

Actual Book Review: October 4th So I had this totally awesome book review, but Goodreads timed out when I tried to save it. Hera or Gaea are being really mean. They don't want you to read this book. Hera because she loves Jason more than Percy, and Gaea because she's evil, and vice versa. BUT DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE EVIL PEOPLE!!! PERCY IS THE TOTALLY AWESOMEST DEMIGOD EVA'!!!! JASON STINKS!!! Though Leo's hot... Anyway, like I said before Hera messed with Goodreads, <---A>Rick Riordan</---A> may have lost his marbles when he wrote \"The Lost Hero.\" I mean, come on, there is no way he can start a series with an arrogent amnesiac who everyone claims is the best thing since Pac Man to be as well loved as Percy. Percy's a better amnesiac, and this is a much better book than the first one. One reason is each of the characters get a set of four chapters instead of two. This settles the pacing down and gives us a real chance to get to know the two newbies, Frank and Hazel. Poor Jason and Piper didn't really stand a chance with the two chapter formula. In this book, Frank and Hazel really get a lot of spotlight, and they grow on you, each with a pretty cool background history (Hazel especially) and great character growth (Frank especially). Also, this book didn't follow some kind of obvious plot path that the first one did. The first one was like you could clearly see where Rick had wrote his plot web. This one didn't have you seeing who was going to be the main hero where. Well, not too much anyway. Oh, and the battles where totally original, unlike \"The Lost Hero\", which seemed to borrow (steal) all it's battle ideas from the Percy Jackson series. I'm going to wrap this up now by saying that this book has restored my faith in Rick Riordan. I was afraid that he had totally lost his mind, but, even though he seems in love with Jason now, I don't think this series will be soooo bad. Especially since Percy's back and we now have the Amazing Flaming Valdez ;) BTW, I totally love everyone who's liked or commented on my review. It made me feel special. HUGS FOR EVERYONE!!!!! ...more Finished doing my re-read of this! I'm trying to go through the whole series before the last book comes out in the fall. I'll write a new review at some point.

Yes, even though these books are most likely aimed at 12-year-old boys and I'm an 18-year-old girl. I don't care. They're amazing. So yeah! I am dying to read Son of Neptune. GAHHHH I have missed Percy ever so much. I want him back. When he wasn't in the first book at all, I threw it across the room. But don't get me wrong, I loved it. I JUST WANT PERCY. Well, I haven't read this yet so there's not much to say review-wise. I can only judge it by the cover and by the Chapter One excerpt which is floating around on the internet. (Just Google \"son of neptune first chapter\" and you'll find it.) Cover: AAHHHH KICKASS! *looks more closely* IS THAT PERCY? THAT'S PERCY! Well duh, the book is called Son of Neptune. So he has to be in it. *looks even more closely* Wait, what the hell is up with his face? He looks like a monkey man. PERCY IS NOT A MONKEY. Oh well ... I'll forgive. Also, why does he have a giant gold bird? And why is he in Antarctica? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE? This is just killing me, man. First chapter: AAHHHHH PERCY PERCY PERCY. PERCY IS BACK. And he doesn't remember anything! This is terrible. ... Except, HE REMEMBERS ANNABETH. YESSSS. *SOBS* YOU'D BETTER NOT FORGET ANNABETH, PERCY. OR I'LL KILL YOU. I'LL HUNT YOU DOWN AND STRANGLE YOU UNTIL YOU REMEMBER, YOU DIMWIT. Haha ... the gorgons. \"Hello, my name is DIE YOU DEMIGOD SCUM!\" Oh, Rick Riordan. You make me laugh. I love you. AHHHH that excerpt was not long enough. I object. I want this book NOWWWW DAMMIT. .... Well, that's all I've got to say for now. You'll have to wait until October for the rest. After reading Son of Neptune (10/6/11): How many stars do I give this book, do you ask? THIS MANY: A WHOLE GALAXY OF STARS! ALL THE STARS IN THE SKYYYY! Okay, that's an exaggeration, I suppose. And no, this book isn't perfect. But it made me really, really, really happy. So that's enough for me. I won't go into much detail about the plot, since if you're reading this review you've probably read the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series and probably The Lost Hero as well \u2026 Sooo you probably have at least the basic idea. Basically, we get Percy back. (YAAAAAAAY!) In this book, he has lost his memory and then stumbles upon a camp similar to Camp Half-Blood, only dedicated to the Roman gods (instead of the Greek gods). At this camp, he soon befriends Frank and Hazel\u2013\u2013two lovely additions to the cast of characters\u2013\u2013who are both kids with pretty screwed up lives. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say they have both lost their mortal mothers (and both have immortal fathers) and both have terrible curses. They also obviously like each other but don't want to admit it; nor do they want to tell each other about their curses. The trio ends up going on a quest to rescue Death, and \u2026 awesomeness ensues. First and foremost, I want to say that I was infinitely happy to have Percy come back into the story again. When he didn't make a single appearance in The Lost Hero, I finished the book and looked like this girl: So when I first read the excerpt and discovered that Percy was one of the main characters, I was SUPER EXCITED. Now, I know what we were all nervous about. (This is going to involve spoilers for The Lost Hero. So if you haven't read it, just go away.) We all know that horrible cliffhanger at the end of The Lost Hero, informing us in the LAST FREAKING SENTENCE that Percy doesn't remember who he is anymore. And that means, a billion fangirls across the world instantly said, \"OMIGOD HE FORGETS ANNABETH?!\" And burst into tears. I was one of them. If that was the case, I would have been seriously pissed off. Seeing as Jason also lost his memory and (mostly) forgot both his girlfriends \u2026 It seemed like a reasonable fear. However, on page 4 of Son of Neptune : The city had some connection to Annabeth\u2013\u2013the only person he could remember from his past. THANK GOOOOODDDD!!!! I can assure you, ye fellow rabid Percabeth fans \u2026 Rick Riordan is smart enough to realize he shouldn't mess with that. Percy remembers Annabeth well enough that he knows not to go around snogging other hot girls. (I don't think I've ever used the word \"snogging\" before.) But anyway, you get the point. There was nothing to worry about there. But anyway, back to Percy in general. It is just fabulous to have him back again. It was interesting to see him in this new situation where he's the expert on everything rather than being the clueless one like he was at the beginning of The Lightning Thief. AWW HE'S GROWN UP SO MUCH. *sobs* He pretty much spends the whole book kicking ass \u2026 which is kind of unrealistic I guess, and I kinda miss him being clueless, but oh well. It's cool with me. As for the new characters, they're awesome. Frank and Hazel are very well-developed and so is their relationship. They have unique and intriguing backstories. Plus they make an adorable couple. :) (Okay, kind of side note but there's one little thing that bothers me. It seems like Rick Riordan always pairs up characters who are minorities \u2026 That is, he creates biracial couples, but it's never a white person and a minority together. I mean, I'm happy that his characters come from all different kinds of backgrounds, and that he's not too \"in your face\" about it like a lot of authors are. But I don't know, I just find it a bit weird.) The plot is the typical Riordan plot\u2013\u2013everyone goes on a crazy quest where they encounter various mythological beings/gods/creatures along the way. It's pretty much what you expect, except Frank and Hazel's flashbacks give it a slightly darker tone than the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. But, even with the darker elements thrown in, the usual humor is still there. (See quotes below.) Rick Riordan's humorous tone never fails to make me grin my head off. So anyway, despite my love for this book \u2026 now comes the slightly more critical part. My few issues with this book: A) It's kind of obvious that the whole Roman thing didn't occur to Rick Riordan until after he'd written the Percy Jackson series. And as much as he tries to explain it, it still doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. It's weird that they just never talked about Camp Jupiter at Camp Half-Blood at all. Also, I still have trouble understanding how the Greek gods are also Roman gods \u2026 Like, they're the same \u2026 but they're not. I don't get it. So do they have multiple personality disorder or something? B) I think Riordan might have messed up the timeline a bit. When I was reading The Lost Hero I was under the impression that a couple of years had gone by\u2013\u2013although maybe I made this up entirely. I seem to recall at the beginning of The Lost Hero, when Jason met Annabeth, he observed that she appeared to be a couple of years older than him\u2013\u2013and he was 16. Since Annabeth and Percy were both 16 at the end of the first series, I assumed this meant that they were like 18 or so now. But then at the beginning of Son of Neptune Percy mentions that he's still 16 \u2026 and at the end of the book we're told that only two months have gone by. Yeahhh. I'm confused too. I guess Annabeth is just older-looking than she really is? C) Okay, this one is a spoiler. (view spoiler) [I'm still confused as to why Nico pretends not to know who Percy is. At first I thought Nico had lost his memory, too. But then I was like, \"Wait? He doesn't? What? WHAT? My BRAAAIIIN.\" (hide spoiler) ] D) I understand that these are kids' books and all, but sometimes the lack of random-civilian death is pretty unrealistic. Like at one point in this book, there's a part where a train is described as going \"toppling\" off the tracks \u2026 And then Riordan tells us that no one on the train was injured one bit. I don't understand why he can't just kill off a few people for the sake of making it seem more realistic. I mean, he didn't have a problem with killing off lots of random campers in the fifth Percy Jackson book. It would just be like, \"During the battle, several kids had died.\" So \u2026 ? All right, that's pretty much all the major criticisms I have. Also I just wanted to say, I liked this more than The Lost Hero (which I still loved, but not as much). My one major problem with The Lost Hero was that I didn't feel much of a connection to Jason. Since he didn't have a past, it was hard to like him as a character. He was just like, \"I'm so kickass and I don't know why!\" Whereas, although Percy also loses his memory, the reader still knows everything that happened to him, so his kickassery is more acceptable. Over all, I thought this book is wonderful. If you are a Percy Jackson and/or mythology geek like me, I think you will be pleased with it. Oh, and did I mention I MET RICK RIORDAN LAST WEEK? CRAZINESS, MANNNN! He happened to have a book signing at the Barnes & Noble near my hometown \u2026 and I happened to be home last weekend so it all worked out. IT WAS MEANT TO BEEEE! So, my friend and my sisters decided to go. (I mean \u2026 WHY WOULDN'T WE?!) And we get there \u2026 to find out we have to wait in a line that looked like this: Sorry, my iPod takes shitty photos, but I think you get the basic idea. Also, that's not really a single line. It's a line that snakes around about four or five times\u2013\u2013maybe more. And that's just the line behind the bookstore. Once you got to the front of the store you had to wait in THIS line: Long story short, there were 2,000 people in that line. TWO FREAKING THOUSAND!!!! And we had to wait in that line for approximately two and a half hours. But, it was SO TOTALLY WORTH IT. When we finally got inside I was like, about to pee myself with excitement. I mean, Rick Riordan was RIGHT THERE. My friend and I were both like\u2026 AAHHHH!!!!!!! Obviously since there were a billion people there, the line was moving really fast and I didn't get a chance to talk to Rick for very long. Our conversation went something like this: Rick: Hi! Me: Hi! Rick: How are you? Me: Good, how are you? Rick: Great! *signs my books* Me: Thanks! It's so cool to meet you! Rick: You too! Me: *Leaves* DID YOU HEAR THAT? RICK RIORDAN INDIRECTLY SAID IT WAS COOL TO MEET ME. Okay I'll stop now. Gifs are too dang addicting. But seriously. That 2-second conversation totally made my life. Also, there were all these adorable posters there drawn by little kids. This one was my favorite: Totally \u2026 DUH!!!! (I'll excuse the kid for spelling Rick Riordan's name wrong.) Anyway, I am SO SO SO SO SO excited for the next book, The Mark of Athena . After finishing this one I'm fairly sure Annabeth is going to be the main character in the next one. And well, the title kind of confirms that. And she's my favorite character so \u2026 [image error] I just wish it would come out RIGHT NOW. But I suppose I'll have to wait a year. Well, thus ends my ranting. :) Hope you enjoyed it. UPDATE: I just found this thing on Tumblr that was too funny not to post. Ah hahahaha.

I just usually end up zoning out in parts like And these books are still aimed at a slightly younger audience, so I think you probably just have to be in the right mood to not be irritated by the cyclopes & harpies after a few pages. I clearly was not in that mood :) I love the characters and the diversity, though!! And the clever twists on Greek & Roman mythology are always fun. The way the Roman camp was set up was my favorite part and I wished the story had stayed there instead of heading to Alaska. I really did love the first 1/3 of the story. So I did enjoy the overall idea of the book, but it definitely lost my interest at times. It spent a lot of time establishing the sequels, though, so I'll check those out! ...more PERCY!!!

I loved it and I'm going to read the next one after my brother return my nook since he's not yet finish reading Catching Fire. :) Thoughts before reading 10.2011 *screams then cover mouth* Can't wait, can't wait OH MY GODS I REALLY NEED THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW!!! Rick Riordan writes faster please please please!!! My Speculations (SPOILER ALERT) (scroll down) [image error] 1. Oh my gods! There's another camp with the Roman demigods this time! I'm sure it will be cool on the next book and that we'll gonna meet some kiddos of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto et cetera et cetera(basically all the planets of our Solar System). 2. Son of Neptune? Is this Percy Jackson or another character (another son of Poseidon??? like with Jason and Thalia)? 3. Percy Jackson in the new camp, amnesiac and confused and all that like Jason was. Could it possibly be that there's also another girl in the other camp that he might fall in love with? 4. Jason already have a girlfriend in his old camp and then in the future there would be a love triangle. 5. We had met the three kids of the prophecy, Jason(son of Jupiter), Leo(son of Hephaestus) and Piper(daughter of Aphrodite). There's only four left, I'm guessing the three would came from the Roman demigods camp (my wish was that the three kids would be a son/daughter of Mars, Pluto and Saturn)and the last kid will be Percy Jackson (son of Poseidon). ...more 8:20 a.m, December, 2010 I haven't read it, but still gave five stars, 'cause I know so. <+++>The Son of Neptune</+++> is going to be a big hit.

He is adopted by misfits Hazel, daughter of Pluto, and Frank, of the unknown father, into their Legion cohort. Camp politics occur, a quest is given, and the three set-off to the \"land beyond the gods,\" Alaska (and don't you just wonder what Riordan was insinuating there??). Along the way they encounter antagonistic wild grain (as opposed to cereal grains), R.O.F.L. (\"Rainbow Organic Foods and Lifestyles\"), Phineas and the harpies, the Amazons who run Amazon (and how Riordan slipped that one past Legal, I'll never know), and a horse with a penchant for swearing ( \"'Dude,' Percy told the horse, 'I've gotten suspended for saying less than that'\" ). Character growth ensues. Overall, a fun and quick read that improves significantly once the heroes leave on their quest. I give Riordan credit for integrating so much information about Roman culture in a mostly natural way, through the device of Percy experiencing the camp for the first time. A number of flashbacks for both Hazel, the female lead, and Frank, the other male lead, don't encourage forward plot motion. Although I can't say I like it, Riordan doesn't pull punches on selfish behavior, and I admire the way the teens in the book can be as self-interested, manipulative and as driven as adults. The main reasons I continue to read this series is its focus on mythology and the swiftly moving plot. I found myths to be integrated well, in an entirely different way from the first book. I appreciate having my memory jogged about Roman mythology, and it was interesting when Percy has a bit of a meltdown realizing that the benevolence of certain beings like fauns, centaurs and cyclops is different depending on your mythological background. Luckily, Isis has some green tea to fix him right up. One criticism is that I was a little annoyed that the female lead is being set up with a shameful secret again --can we forget the duplicitous female as a character option? I guess because we are talking Greek and Roman here, maybe not, as their favorite goddesses seemed to be the virginal ones like Athena and Artemis. I suppose the male, Frank, has a shameful secret, but his shame has more to do with self-esteem than with morality. Still, it leads me to wonder if shame/embarrassment is used overmuch as a characterization tool. Only our lead 'heroes' in his books, Jason and Percy, are without shameful pasts (that they know). Character award goes to Ella, book-loving but vocabulary-challenged, in the best harpy appearance ever. She should get together with the wyvern from The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making : \"Now she was resting comfortably in the stern, nibbling bits of jerky and reciting random lines from Charles Dickens and 50 Tricks to Teach Your Dog .\" Lots of humorous lines, only occasionally at the possible expense of story, \"'You seem to be clean,' Terminus decided. 'Do you have anything to declare?' 'Yes,' Percy said. 'I declare this is stupid.'\" The scene meeting Isis, the rainbow goddess, was priceless, and done well enough to avoid being a farce. She touched on all those things young conforming teens hate most--glueten-free foods, tea, non-aggression, and man-satchels. But she was allowed a very nice speech about self-definition: \"I've been reading about Buddhism. And Taoism. I haven't decided between them.\" \"But...\" Hazel looked mystified. \"Aren't you a Greek goddess?\" Iris crossed her arms. \"Don't try to put me in a box, demigod. I'm not defined by my past.\" Overall, enjoyable. Like classic Muppets, Riordan integrates enough references to keep adults entertained. Nice balance of humor and seriousness, examining issues of identity and belonging. Three and a half stars.

It's always slightly annoying to be retold everything. Having learnt about the Greek world in the original series I got a tad annoyed at Percy's inner monologue at the beginning. Though, that soon passed as I did get absorbed into the world of the Roman camp. I was sucked in despite already having read the book. I think because of the first book in the spinoff and this one it's possible not to have read the original series before diving in. Of course you'll be spoiled but just in case you weren't interested in the first series but this one it's possible to read! \u201cSo you do have a plan?\u201d Octavian asked skeptically. Percy looked at his teammates. \u201cWe go to Alaska as fast as possible...\u201d \u201cAnd we improvise,\u201d Hazel said. \"A lot,\" Frank added.\u201d During this book we get to learn about the Roman gods and how they are in fact different from the Greeks. We get to learn about the different personalities they took on when changing cultures and how there are some different gods mingled in as well. It was really interesting to read about, even if it was the second time for me. To me it doesn't seem like Rick recycled his main character formula for the characters. Of course two of the characters become a couple, but it wasn't so closely connected to the personalities that were presented in Percy Jackson. Percy is our token son of Poseidon/Neptune in which we've already been introduced to. Percy is the character we know and love throughout the book. He clings to a single memory of Annabeth, one of the only things he remembers. He asks stupid questions, misinterprets things but is also sassy as hell and quick to pick up things. Though, I guess you would if you were dating a daughter of Athena. Hazel a daughter of Pluto/Hades. She's a person of colour, which I found nice to have in the book despite it very rarely being mentioned. Hazel has a secret, however. A secret that is pretty intense and honestly I love it. Frank a son of Mars/Ares. Frank is a lactose intolerant demigod. Not an important fact, but I just found it amusing since I'm also lactose intolerant. I'm going to claim being a demigod now, thank you very much for Frank. He also adds another aspect of diversity to the characters as he's Chinese and Canadian. Frank himself also has a secret, because why not?! Likes - Reyna - War games - Amazons having the company Amazon? Genius - Franks grandma - The Amazons - The battles Dislikes - \"Cinnamon toast coloured hair\" I'm honestly not even sure what this means just don't like it - Octavian I mean dude is hardcore evil and also anyone who destroys stuff animals is in my bad books - The battle at Camp Jupiter was way too short for my liking Overall, definitely a stellar book. I absolutely recommend this series to people who have read the Percy Jackson or are purely interested in Rick's writing but don't want to read about a younger protagonist. Also, if things in the review don't make sense it's because I wrote it while sitting at a bus stop waiting for my mum to pick me up after travelling on two buses and a train already.

There's a real pattern I'm seeing with plots in Riordan's books and unfortunately he doesn't ever seem to stray very far from his one blueprint. It's always like this: unlikely heroes with secrets from the past go on an impossible quest with a super short time limit; they manage to hit a new mythological threat everywhere they stop, but barely make it past; secrets come out, generally with 0 consequences for anyone involved; they conveniently complete the quest right in time with enormously good luck. The Son of Neptune fits the same pattern all over again, I have to say I'm getting bored with the repetition. Riordan occasionally tries to insert a little commentary about our own world into his books, kind of like this: \"True, we hoped to awaken Gaea during World War II. That would have been glorious. But really, the world is in almost as bad a shape now.\" But overall, Rick Riordan doesn't leave himself much room to be creative because of his well-rehearsed rigid plot structure. I also need to complain about the romance between Hazel and Frank because there was no chemistry to be found. Their love story was the kind where a boy and a girl realize they're both straight and happen to have an individual of the opposite gender nearby, so they think, \"Hey, why not? Let's get together.\" There was no tension or strong emotion built up between them, Hazel and Frank just kind of ended up together without good reason. Very unimpressive. I do commend Rick Riordan on the big steps he's made towards diversifying the Percy Jackson books. We now have a gay necromancer, a latino pyromaniac, an African American psychic's daughter, and a Chinese warrior joining the cast of demigods in the series. I definitely enjoyed the journey away from typical US East Coast folk, for once. Despite problems with the book, I still enjoyed it as a whole. I love the teenage snark in every chapter and the ridiculous situations in which our heroes inadvertently find themselves again and again. Perfec example: \"I'm fine!\" Percy yelled as he ran by, followed by a giant screaming bloody murder. Those kids really grow on me, faults and all.

Most of the time I was confused, annoyed, or bored. Those three are not good when combined, trust me. Instead of following the story with the characters introduced in The Lost Hero , this book takes us to a now amnesiac Percy, who turned out to be wandering alone but now is in the Roman equivalent of Camp Half-Blood: Camp Jupiter. It works in a similar way to Camp Half-Blood, except they worship the Roman \"version\" of the gods and their games, rules, ways of handling the camp and the kids follow the Roman culture. Oh, and the demigods in it are all children of Roman gods. This blend Riordan made with Greek and Roman mythology was very clever. I'm slowly seeing the differences and how they suit in the world created by him. And plus, I like this idea of old enemies (Greece and Rome) having to fight together to bring down a stronger and more dangerous enemy who can both bring them down and be the end of civilization as we know it. However, this mix was also the beginning of my problems. Seriously, you have no idea of the trouble I got in trying to understand this. It was so damn confusing. For example, these deities, as far as I know, have multiple personalities, and so they can switch from Greek to Roman if it pleases them, but why do the characters (gods, campers, etc.) call a god or any creature by their Greek name and in the same sentence they also use their Roman name? How do I even differentiate when they're behaving Greek-ish or Roman-ish?!?! I know this series wasn't probably planned when Percy Jackson and the Olympians was written, but those sudden changes sound to me like plot holes, and I'm afraid I'll never truly get to understand this world again - not like I did while reading PJO, at least. The characters were another reason why I didn't like this as much as I wanted. Since we're now in a different camp, new characters are introduced, and just so the same old formula Riordan used in PJO can apply to this, it's again a trio: Percy, Frank and Hazel. I cannot say I liked them a lot, not even Percy, who didn't seem like himself at all. In fact, while he was in his amnesiac self, he sounded suspiciously similar to Jason, and well, I didn't exactly love him. Gratefully, he was his old self again by the end, and my love for him came back. Frank was great, simply put. I didn't love him (he was just okay for me), but given the fact that he's a son of Mars (Ares' Roman form), I liked that he wasn't the same as the other children of Ares I had previously met - that is, reckless, looking for fights, extremely confident, etc. Instead of that, he was this troubled, insecure kid, who only grew better as the book progressed. And the last of the trio was Hazel, a daughter of Pluto (aka Hades). She has a past she's not very proud of, and she has all this mystery surrounding her. She was my least favourite of the trio, especially since she kept moaning about how tragic her life was. I get it, she has a dark past, but characters that constantly say \"you know nothing about me, I'm a monster\" can easily annoy me. And indeed, I lost my patience more than once. But none of that wasn't as annoying as the fact that no one recognized Percy. I know, I know! New camp, no one knows him, etc, etc, but how about <---C>Nico di Angelo</---C>? Why didn't he remember Percy? Why didn't gods that had met him remember him either? Why all this mystery?!?! Why do they keep so much information from us?!? I feel like I'm being tricked, and I absolutely hate that. I had a problem with the romance as well. You're all saying at this moment: ... but it's not true! I can tolerate romance. I can \"ship\" couples and I can drown in feelings too, but this is just turning too awkward. In fact, Percy + Annabeth is an example of a pairing I love and shipped before it sailed. Now we have also Frank + Hazel. I'm not saying what was between them was instalove because they were friends before having romantic feelings for each other, but all the time I was like, dude, she's 13, let the kid be a kid, stop fantasizing about kissing her. Also... I feel like the romance is starting to be forced into the story. Like, a man meets a woman and I just know they're going to end up being a couple at some point. Like Ella and Tyson: They got all blushy, and it's obvious that state of their relationship will progress into something more, just like Percy + Annabeth, Jason + Piper and now Frank + Hazel. Where are all the singles in this series? I'm even sensing a love triangle in the future, but I really hope I'm wrong. I don't know how more drama I'll be able to endure. This wasn't entirely bad, though. While the plot structure is still the same as in every damn book in the PJO series, the twists were more cleverly done, and there's more action too, as well as no accidental falls into obvious traps. And there's diversity! Lots of it, actually, and that just makes me happy, even more since it doesn't feel as if Riordan is saying \"Chinese, check! Black, check! Canadian, check! Mexican, check!\" And of course, the story grows more complex the more I progress. I can't wait to see how things will turn out, although if this is following the same formula PJO did, then there will be suffer in the next book that will only get worse in book 4 and will end in chaos in book 5. But anyway, I may be mistaken. Now I'm off to read book 3! ...more UPDATE: The cover's out. THE. FREAKIN. COVER. IS OUT. Oh my. Oh my, oh my, oh my. IT'S SO AMAZING I COULD EXPLODE!!!

Second, Jason already has a girlfriend at his camp but will end up with Piper anyway. And oh yes, I expect catfights between Piper and the other girl >:)I hope that Percy doesn't get into someone at the roman camp, cause with Annabeth still around, there's surely gonna be trouble.

The start of the book was kind of slow, but it still held my attention. The whole new world is now revealed - the Roman aspect of the story = camp Jupiter = the place where Roman demigods stay for safety and for training. You will notice that things are quite different there than in camp Half Blood. It's far more crueler and more power oriented place. ____________________________________________ STORY : ____________________________________________ Three demigods have been chosen to go on a quest to save their camp Jupiter. Those three are Percy (who has amnesia), Hazel (daughter of Hades/Pluto) and Frank (the unclaimed one). They have to go to Alaska and to free god Thanatos so the dead can stay dead. Because if they don't, the camp won't survive an attack from giants that have arisen from their slumber under the command of their mother Gaea. ____________________________________________ CHARACTERS : ____________________________________________ This time, we are introduced to new characters Hazel & Frank, as well as the already known Percy Jackson. Except...there is one problem: he has amnesia. Same as Jason whom we met in the previous book. \u2666 Percy was once a leader of camp half blood until he was kidnapped by Hera and been wiped of his memories. It doesn't help him any less that he went to camp Jupiter - where rules are something different. There he meets Hazel, Frank and Nico (who already knows him but is going with the flow \"hi, nice to meet you too\"). The gods have different plans for him and being in camp Jupiter is one of them. The only thing he does remember is Annabeth, his girlfriend and best friend. And its the name which keeps him going forward. I have to say, that i really missed this idiot, and i am glad he is back :D He didn't change, he is still strong,dependable and sarcastic and funny as hell! \u2666 Hazel ,daughter of Pluto, should have been dead. Except she was saved by her brother Nico, son of Hades(Pluto) and is given a second chance in life. No one knows her secret and her cursed gift makes her life even more miserable. Hazel is really sweet, strong and interesting character and i definitely love her the most of all female characters in this series. \u2666 Frank is good at archery and while still being unclaimed, he hopes it will be by Apollo, since Apollo is most likely his father. Alas, things are not as they seem to be, and his history and roots go far more deeper than anyone else's. But he also has secrets, and one of them lies in a burned stick. He is kind, peaceful and adorable. Frank is just simply interesting and sweet character, and he doubts himself and his destiny, but he has no choice but to accept it. Or face the consequences. \u2666 Other characters such as Renya, Octavian (whom i hate with passion) and harpy Ella and so on, were quite interesting and nice addition. I couldn't help myself but ship them all together - especially Hazel and Frank (they are born for each other). And i am happy that Nico is finally back (i missed that grim idiot lol)... ____________________________________________ OVERALL : ____________________________________________ Well done, just so well done. I am enjoying these more than i hoped for. It's just well done and really interesting (and still i recommend you to read PJ series if you haven't already). And as soon as i have finished this one, i just HAD to start the next book already. I really have no idea what i will do when i finish House of Hades T_T.

Accompanying him are his two new friends and Camp Jupiter underdogs : Hazel Levesque and Frank Zhang . -------------------------------------------------------------- Things that enchanted my reader\u2019s palate like Ambrosia: # 1: THE RETURN OF OL\u2019SEAWEED BRAIN : When the battle for Olympus ended with Annabeth and Percy sharing an underwater kiss, I was ready to bid adieu to the likeable boy wonder. Any attempt to stretch the taffy by Rick Riordan would pale in comparison to the immensely popular 7-Book series. Atleast that\u2019s what I, with my limited vision assumed. But Riordan is not a brilliant storyteller for nothing. He plunges Percy Jackson into a whole new can of worms ( or basilisks, which seems more appropriate ) and has you whooping like a herd of Party-Ponies. Percy\u2019s trademark wit, droll acceptance of dastardly situations, unerring loyalty to friends (old and new) and the ability to fight like a fiend is displayed to full effect. The author has also done the wise job of adding a ring of maturity to Percy\u2019s character. His new-found confidence adds a much-needed foil to the fledgling charms of Hazel and Frank. # 2: HAZEL LEVESQUE : Such a brave and endearing heroine. She joins Hermione Granger and Annabeth Chase in the ranks of noteworthy YA Lit. role-models for young girls. Burdened by a dark past, unsure of a long future, adorably embarrassed around the boy she likes and a bad-a** warrior to round it up nicely, Hazel is a treat to read. # 3: FRANK ZHANG. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, FRANK ZHANG\u2019S GRANDMOTHER: I cannot rave enough about the massive appeal of Frank Zhang without veering into *SPOILER* territory. Suffice to say that the baby-faced, muscle-bound demigod keeps you hooked through his emotional trauma and growth. As for Granny Zhang....I was loving and fearing her in equal measures. All that aristocratic arrogance dueling with a caring heart makes for one intimidating matriarch. # 4: RICK RIORDAN\u2019S SIGNATURE QUIRKS : (view spoiler) [ a) Mars (the Roman name for Ares ) declaring the Quest was one of my favourite bits. When the God of War whips out a scroll and a ballpoint pen and scribbles a brusque, \u201cGo to Alaska. Find Thanatos and free him. Come back by Sundown on June Twenty-fourth or die\u201d with nary a hint of drama and the absolute absence of riddled prophecies....you got to love the big guy. b) I had the biggest smile on my face when I read that Amazon.com is being run by.....you guessed it.....the condescending female warriors, *THE AMAZONS* . Their Queen sits on a throne made from a thousand copies of a book called \u201cThe Five Habits of Highly Aggressive Women\u201d.( Seriously how can anyone not cackle over that?!? ). vintage Riordan. c) Thanatos (the God of Death) has a pure black iPad. As he whips it out, Frank Zhang hopes fervently, \u201c Please don\u2019t let there be an App for reaping souls\u201d. Again, adorable.

Gaia was an unexpected villain. A Goddess who invokes Giants, resurrects dead monsters, murmurs nasty thoughts into vulnerable minds, makes vile promises to kill our favourite demigods and rears unearthly armies to overtake the world is NOT someone who would inspire the *Hug-A-Tree* emotion in you. And the best bit is that all these tender acts are being committed while the lady is still trapped underground. What will happen when she\u2019s unleashed in all her grimy glory?--->*Delicious Shiver-Down-The-Spine Time* # 6 : ACTION SEQUENCES : Here\u2019s where you bring in all your cherished Die-Hard inspired adrenaline. The book is loaded with rip-roaring battle sequences. It gets the blood flowing and the inner warrior roars with wholehearted approval. # 7: SUPPORTING CHARACTERS : a) Slimy, power-hungry Octavian who sees prophecies in the innards of stuffed toys. b) Royal *you-lie-and-my-dogs-will-dismember-you* Reyna . c) Ella , the twitchy red-feathered harpy with the quirk of spouting random bursts of pointless (and sometimes deadly-useful) information. d) Nico Di Angelo in a short ( but hopefully epic ) reappearance. e) Iris , the Goddess of The Rainbow (and now the proprietor of R.O.F.L. \u2013Rainbow Organic Foods and Lifestyle). Don't ask. f) Terminus , the rule abiding God of Boundaries. Never has a pillar of stone been so pedantic. And so useful. I cannot elaborate on any without spilling out the plot. All I can do is assure you that it\u2019s a stellar casting. # 8: ARION : Okay, which girl/woman does not want a celestial Horse that can break the sound barrier, run on water and up slippery slopes, cuss like a seasoned sailor and mutter grumpily \u201c I will trample you to bits, silly Chinese Canadian baby man! \u201d.

Case closed. -------------------------------------------------------------- Things that tasted like Iris\u2019 gluten-free, sugar-free cupcake simulations ( translation: things that left a bitter taste in my mouth ) *..........NO A THING.........* -------------------------------------------------------------- So, in conclusion, did I like HEROES OF OLYMPUS : THE SON OF NEPTUNE? You bet your imperial gold/ celestial bronze/ stygian iron I DID! I LOVED IT! ( And I\u2019m not one to use CAPSLOCK carelessly ) The book is an absolute treat. The return of old favourites stitched with the chutzpah of new arrivals worked like a charm. Yet again, Mythology and it's Gods left the hallowed portals and became cheekily shod with feet-of-clay. With a \u201cit-could-go-anyway\u201d cliffhanger, Rick Riordan has laid the groundwork for a delightful sequel. ATHENA , make your MARK already!

I missed him so much in book 1, but in the process I became really attached to the three new characters we were introduced to. I was really hoping hat they would be in this book, but instead we got a couple MORE new characters (who are also awesome, so no complaints there). A lot of new questions have come up in regards to some of the characters' back stories, so I'm really excited to hop into the next book to find out what's going on!! CAN'T WAIT CAN'T WAIT AAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S GOING TO BE AWESOME BUT IF PERCY AND ANNABETH AREN'T TWO OF THE SEVEN DEMIGODS THEN I WILL WRITE RICK RIORDAN AND YELL AT HIM!!! I KNOW HE ALREADY HAD HIS WHOLE SERIES BUT I DON'T CAAAAAAAAAAARE!!!!!!!!!!! OK, taking my friend Irene's excellent advice I am now going to review chapter one. It was WAY too darn short! Too short! But I LOVED the part about the 'comfy panda pillow pet (as seen on TV).\" LOL! Ughhh. The sum CAN'T WAIT CAN'T WAIT AAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Argh! Okay, that was a slight exaggeration. Sue me. Aahh.....there's 513 pages. MUCH better. Originally, the Goodreads thing said THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR. O.O I was like, \"What the...?!?! No freaking fair way omigosh!!!\" Okay. \"Blah blah blah.....Percy Jackson remembers only his name and the name of Annabeth, a mysterious woman he associates somehow with the city of San Francisco.\" Um, okay. What's up with WOMAN?!??!?!?!!?! I mean, she's......sixteen?! I hate it when books do that!!! Come, on, library......HURRY UP AND GET THE DARN BOOK TO ME. D-X AHHHHHHHH!!!!!! NEW SUMMARY!!! NEW SUMMARY!!! MUST GO READ. RIGHT. NOW. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH AH AH AH AH AH And, to rant just a little bit more. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OKAY. Ranting over. I CANNOT WAIT UNTIL I GET THE STUPID BOOK!!!!!! AIIEEEE!!! I have read it. THAT'S FREAKING RIGHT!!! I HAVE READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think it's rather appropriate that Dynamite is playing right now. ^.^ Anyway, I L-O-V-E-D this one A LOT better than The Lost Hero. I really think Riordan (I HATE YOU) is in his element (WELL NOT REALLY....VERY MAD AT YOU!!!!) when he's writing Percy. Even the narration seemed better, oddly enough. I was not a big fan of Hazel...she was too...too Piper-ish. Like, \"Augh, I can't tell my friends this! They will abandon me!\" which is the exact same thing Piper said. Frank was great! I loved that he was Asian, even if he doesn't exactly seem to embrace that. I really liked his grandmother, too. \"Was that sarcasm, Fai Zhang?\" \"Yes.\" \"Good. There may be hope for you yet.\" XD I might write more later....right now I have to go listen to Just the Way You Are. ^.^ *in January* I finally noticed I hadn't given this a rating OR marked this as read, so I hopped to.

The PJO books were the perfect size for the story. These have too many descriptions that slow everything down. 2. I like the three main characters in this one overall, a lot more than the ones in The Lost Hero (Except for Leo. He's my favorite right next to Percy and a baby sunshine.). 3. Percy is still awesome and sarcastic. I missed him. 4. Hazel and Frank are both very divers \u201c \"I'm fine!\" Percy yelled as he ran by, followed by a giant screaming bloody murder.\u201d 1.

Ancient blood. The blood of princes and heroes. Frank shook the thought out of his head. He was no prince or hero. He was a lactose-intolerant klutz, who couldn\u2019t even protect his friend from getting kidnapped by wheat.\u201d 5. The humor and quotes are still golden even if they didn't happen as often as I hoped. 6. I hate the action scenes. They bore me to death. 7. I'm actually really excited for the next book. 8. Annabeth and Percy must reunite. 9. Leo and Percy should become best friends. ASAP. ...more EDIT, now that I have the book. This was amazing. I love how Percy still remembers Annabeth. I won't spoil anything, but I really REALLY hate how Rick Riordan ended it. I turned the page, anticipating what we've all been waiting for, and BAM. Glossary. -___- That killed me.

We find out what's happened to Percy, and he gets an in-depth look at Camp Jupiter, the Roman equivalent of Camp Halfblood. My main issue with Percy in the original series was that he seemed to just be reacting to all the crazy stuff around him.

Esa sensaci\u00f3n de \u00bfY que pasa si Rick con una peque\u00f1a escena nos arruina todo? Pero, como de costumbre, no me decepcion\u00f3 y sus libros siguen siendo maravillosos, impresionantes, geniales etc. etc. Despu\u00e9s de mucho tiempo volvemos a tener como protagonista a nuestro querido Percy, pero con algo de diferencia, ya que el no recuerda nada de nada. S\u00ed, como le paso a Jason en el libro anterior Como me pas\u00f3 con el libro anterior, cuando empec\u00e9 a leer este libro ten\u00eda un poco de miedo, de incertidumbre. Esa sensaci\u00f3n de \u00bfY que pasa si Rick con una peque\u00f1a escena nos arruina todo? Pero, como de costumbre, no me decepcion\u00f3 y sus libros siguen siendo maravillosos, impresionantes, geniales etc. etc. Despu\u00e9s de mucho tiempo volvemos a tener como protagonista a nuestro querido Percy, pero con algo de diferencia, ya que el no recuerda nada de nada. S\u00ed, como le paso a Jason en el libro anterior, que luego descubre que es romano aunque est\u00e9 en el Campamento Mestizo. Nuestra taan simp\u00e1tica Hera/Juno ha hecho lo mismo y Percy es mandado al Campamento J\u00fapiter, que vendr\u00eda a ser lo mismo que el otro campamento, pero de los romanos. Todo es un l\u00edo para Percy, pero sin embargo recuerda algunas cosas sueltas... algunos nombres. Como una tal Annabeth, que al parecer era su novia *suspiro de una fangirl shippeadora de Percabeth* Para complicar las cosas, parece que Gea, la Madre Tierra, est\u00e1 despertando y quiere destruir el Olimpo para siempre. Como siempre, la trama de estos libros es lo m\u00e1s genial que puede haber, ya que siempre hay algo m\u00e1s para averiguar, alg\u00fan misterio que resolver y eso mantiene las ganas de leer del lector hasta la \u00faltima p\u00e1gina. Ha sido maravillosamente genial tener a Percy como uno de los narradores. Lo sigo amando muuucho, es uno de mis personajes favoritos ever. Luego tenemos a varios personajes nuevos, entre ellos Hazel, una chica muy simp\u00e1tica que tiene una historia un poco turbia, y Frank un chico canadiense con ascendencia china que es muy inseguro de s\u00ed mismo. Tal como me pas\u00f3 con el libro anterior, me encanta la evoluci\u00f3n de los personajes durante el desarrollo de la historia, ya que van descubriendo cosas, van pensando distinto, van madurando, Me gust\u00f3 mucho aprender cosas nuevas sobre mitolog\u00eda con este libro, Ya sab\u00eda bastante sobre Grecia por la saga anterior, pero con esta pod\u00e9s profundizar sobre la romana y aprender sobre las otras facetas de los dioses. Me encant\u00f3. El final tiene eso de suspenso, eso que te da ganas de agarrar el siguiente tomo tan r\u00e1pido como puedas y sumergirse en la lectura. Encima nuestro Rick dej\u00f3 esa escena ah\u00ed, con toda la tensi\u00f3n... Cuando termin\u00e9 de leerla tuve que sentarme unos momentos en paz para procesar todo con calma. En resumen, \"El hijo de Neptuno\" es un libro genial, el que m\u00e1s me gust\u00f3 de esta segunda saga hasta ahora. Tiene todo lo que puede tener un libro, eso que el autor combina tan bien, ya que hay romance, hay acci\u00f3n, hay misterio. Hay todo. Es uno de esos libros que te hacen decir \"un cap\u00edtulo m\u00e1s...\" y termin\u00e1s leyendo todo el libro. 5/5 Imprescindible e impredecible. ...more So after I adored The Lost Hero , I was entirely weirded out to realise I didn't fall in love with this one. I mean, it was good . It was funny and Riordan-ish (totally a word) and I loveloveloved that Percy is back! But frankly, I was bored. I know, right?! This surprises me too! I had a rocky start with Riordan, but now, with this being my 7th book of his...I'd call myself a solid fan. MY FAITH IS SHAKEN. WHAT IS THIS. (But, yes, I will be reading book 3 ASAP, do not fear.) So what went wrong?! I So after I adored The Lost Hero , I was entirely weirded out to realise I didn't fall in love with this one. I mean, it was good . It was funny and Riordan-ish (totally a word) and I loveloveloved that Percy is back! But frankly, I was bored. I know, right?! This surprises me too! I had a rocky start with Riordan, but now, with this being my 7th book of his...I'd call myself a solid fan. MY FAITH IS SHAKEN. WHAT IS THIS. (But, yes, I will be reading book 3 ASAP, do not fear.) So what went wrong?! I can't even put my finger on it exactly! There's definitely less humour. I think the new editions of Frank and Hazel weren't as strong as Jason/Leo/Piper. Hazel was interesting, but didn't seem particularly different from all the other Riordan girl characters. Frank was cute and awkward and finally not stick-skinny like everyone else. But still . I wasn't immediately in love, like I was with Leo. And their quest? I DON'T KNOW. I WAS JUST BORED. Unlike in The Lost Hero where I had so so many questions and they were only answered like a crumb at a time, we get the answers for all the riddles so much faster. It left little pull on the story. So, yes, I feel like Captain Gloom here, but it wasn't awful or anything. PERCY IS WONDERFUL. He managed to retain his memories of Annabeth, but not much else. But what I like about Percy is that he loves Annabeth, but it doesn't consume him. It's just...cool. He can exist and have an adventure without moaning over her like every-other-YA-character-ever. Plus I felt like Percy was soooo much better in 3rd person. I LOVE HIM. I loved that his dyslexia is more prominent too!! Before it was just like \"Oh yeah, and Percy has dyslexia which you'll see 2% evidence of over the course of 5 books.\" BUT HERE? YAY! He's dyslexic a lot and I loved the representation. Also. So much diversity. YAY. Frank is Canadian/Chinese and Hazel is coloured and Percy is...ya know. Percy. Dyslexic and ADHD. I did feel weird about Frank and Hazel's \"maybe\" romance. I mean, she's only 13!! 13 is really really young to a) have already experienced heartbreak [her boyfriend Sammy whom she lost], and b) to get romantically involved with a 16 year old boy? IT IS WIERD TO ME, OKAY. In 10 years that won't make a scrape of difference. But when you're so barely a teen, you've got a lot of maturing to do. Plus, at the end of this book, I forsee a LOT of love triangles coming up... Which worries me. I hate love triangles. (view spoiler) [ Like clearly Reyna is going to make a move on Percy, despite him being clear about Annabeth. And then there's the return of Leo/Sammy for Hazel. So Frank is going to be dumped. Then there's Renya and Jason, who might still be a thing? And if they are, hello, poor Piper! SO YEAH. AWKWARDNESS ALL ROUND. Please let it work out okay. pleasepleaseplease. (hide spoiler) ] I liked it, but definitely didn't love it. I can't wait to get my sticky paws on book 3, though, because SO MUCH MONSTERS AND AWESOME. And I want to see all the top awesome characters together. I hope the plots pick up in excitement factor. And I hope it regains some of it's funniness. Because, to be honest, The Son of Neptune was really missing that sparkle I've come to love. But at least the quotes are still golden: \"And he got that gift from Poseidon,\" Percy said. \"That's completely unfair. I can't turn into animals.\" Frank stared at him. \"Unfair? You can breathe underwater and blow up glaciers and summon freaking hurricanes -- and it's unfair that I can be an elephant?\" \"You seem to be clean,\" Terminus decided. \"Do you have anything to declare?\" \"Yes,\" Percy said. \"I declare that this is stupid.\u201d \u201cJeez, Hazel,\" Percy said, \"tell your horse to watch his language.\" Hazel tried not to laugh. \"What did he say?\" \"With the cussing removed? He said he can get us to the top.\" Frank looked incredulous. \"I thought the horse couldn't fly!\" This time Arion whinnied so angrily, even Hazel could guess he was cursing. \"Dude,\" Percy told the horse, \"I've gotten suspended for saying less than that...\u201d \u201cI'm fine!\" Percy yelled out as he ran by, followed by a giant screaming bloody murder.\u201d (I love Percy an unreasonable amount.) ...more 4.5* I did enjoy this, I really did, I just don't like the way the series is going. Like I don't like reading about different characters every book. I understand it will all come together in the end, I just don't like that I have to wait a few books for it. Still a few minor irritations with the writing (cheater narration and themes that seem too MG for a YA series), but overall I am LOVING the new quest and characters. I love that we've got the children from different gods, I love the diversity, and I just enjoy seeing this story come together from multiple perspectives! Much, much improved from PJO!", "Title": "The Son of Neptune"},
