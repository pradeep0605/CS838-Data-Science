To cure myself, I decided to reread a favourite series of mine \u2014The Gallagher Girls. The key to loving this series is to not take it too seriously . It\u2019s a series that explores the idea of being a teenage spy going to a boarding school that teaches spies how to neutralize an enemy, dozen of foreign languages, to unravel a bomb and other kickass things necessary for teenage spies to know. It\u2019s up to the readers to decide if to believe or not all they\u2019re reading about, but it truly isn\u2019t very hard to, because <---A>Ally Carter</---A> created something amazing here. She designed a world-building like a real architect. It\u2019s almost as good as the world-building in Harry Potter, and I\u2019m not even joking here. This first book is packed with spy secrets and adventures, but mostly, it\u2019s a fun story about a spy girl\u2014Cammie\u2014who has never interacted with a guy her age before, encountering a hottie during her first mission. No one was supposed to notice her, but he did. What I like most about this book is that the romance is not the most important part. It\u2019s not solely focused on Cammie and Josh. Every chapter makes us learn new things about the school, the students and the teachers. And we haven\u2019t learned everything yet; there\u2019s still so much left to discover. Reading this series makes the reader feel like he\u2019s part of something special.

With all this in mind, why oh why was I so disappointed upon finishing it? Because this book was subpar to its media attention. The writing, the characters and the subplot were average.<---F> Boring</---F>. I didn\u2019t learn anything particularly new reading it, I wasn\u2019t entertained, and I wasn\u2019t blown away with Ally Carter\u2019s prose. What\u2019s ironic is, the elements that would\u2019ve made this novel a winner\u2014such as character development, for starters\u2014were all there. The girls had interesting (and heartbreaking) backgrounds. But those were for the most part ignored, except for some scenes where Cammie feels the loss that her friend could be facing and feels the loss of her own father, which I felt were the best parts in this entire novel. Because of all the superfluous jokes and one-liners inserted in places that did not require the likes of them. (And usually in parentheses and followed by an exclamation point so the reader can feel the excitement!) The only comment I have of this is: Uncooked spaghetti is not as clever a weapon choice as the author seems to think it is... Because of the underdeveloped relationship between Josh (is that his name? I can\u2019t be bothered to check) and Cammie. I would\u2019ve liked to see the beginning stages of first love instead of being told, after the fact, that they went to such and such movie or something equally nondescript. With a book based on the challenges of falling in love as a spy and having to lead a double life, one would\u2019ve thought such details of the romance would be shared from time to time. Because of the main character. No way in hell is she sixteen and no way in hell is someone that average, intelligence-wise, would be qualified to go to such a pizzazz school like Gallagher Academy. Oh, and, how was she able to fool the adults in that place even for a second? What does that say about the school we are led to believe is The Godsend of Security? I\u2019m not understanding what makes this as popular as it is. It\u2019s not really funny and it\u2019s not really bright. What gives? The only redeeming quality it has, in my opinion, is that it\u2019s making me re-evaluate my verdict of The Squad: Killer Spirit by Jennifer Lynn Barnes, which I am coming to realize is infinitely better. If I had to describe this book in a word, it\u2019d be: Lifeless. No real stakes and no stimulating qualities. Get it from the library. ...more Yes. I'm a full grown adult.

It's a relatively straightforward plot, but with all kinds of shameless fun, plenty of humor, an adorable romance, and of course, cool gadgets. Welcome to spy school! \"Every time I caught a glance at the world around us, I saw another year of my life flash before my eyes.\" Cammie, spy in training, is witty, smart, independent, yet clueless when it comes to boys. She's the perfect protagonist for this story. She got me laughing at her ridiculous antics and hilarious inner (sometimes outer) dialogue. Obviously, being a teenager, she makes plenty of dumb decisions especially when it comes to a boy she likes. However, her own logic is intelligent enough to make it rather amusing instead of annoying. Alongside Cammie we've got a truly fantastic cast of supporting characters who are well-rendered with relevant roles and loud personalities. Friends, family, teachers, classmates, outsiders; there's a big bunch of colorful characters which I think is the main reason why I enjoyed this rather fluffy plot so much. The spy elements in the story are kept fairly simple. We do see the characters in spy-mode, but it's nothing that got me taking notes (yet. - Hey, you never know!). I found this book to be more of an introduction to the spy-school. We begin to uncover the secrets behind Gallagher Academy, which is thought to be a school for privileged elites, but instead, brims with magical possibilities and secret passageways. Oh, and martial arts training!! Boarding school stories are a guilty pleasure of mine. It's unfamiliar territory for me in my small town, nowhere, Canada; I find myself enchanted by their mystique. Since I know we've only just scratched the surface of this uncanny school, I'm particularly looking forward to digging deeper inside its walls, as well as its inhabitants. This first book in the Gallagher Girls series has a plot that concentrates more on the cute, though predictable, romance between the protagonist and an outsider who has no idea what he's getting into. Strangely, with this said, regardless of how different both series obviously are, I kept being reminded of Harry Potter. The magical, secretive school, the large cast of sparkling personalities; evidently this series is quite a bit more frivolous and lighthearted (at least so far), but the vibe I get from it feels similar. Fun and quirky, immature at times, implausible yet entertaining, <+++>I'd Tell You I Love You, But Then I'd Have to Kill You</+++> - which by the way I have to admit I love the titles in this series - is a delightful escape from reality.

Because The Gall Reviewed by Me for TeensReadToo.com Welcome to The Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women, an all-girls school located just outside of Roseville, Virginia. Anyone looking at this elite private boarding school would see just what The Gallagher Academy wants you to see--a preppy school for privileged girls, complete with a guardhouse and stone wall to keep the curious away from their precious charges. And they'd be right, of course, and yet they would be so very, very wrong! Because The Gallagher Academy isn't exactly what it appears to be. It's an elite school, that's for sure, and the only boys who grace its grounds are the male teachers. After that, though, the similarities between The Gallagher Academy and every other elite boarding school in the world ends. Instead of math and reading, English and horseback-riding, the girls who attend this school take courses in Covert Operations, Ancient Languages, Countries of the World, Culture and Assimilation, and Protection and Enforcement. The Gallagher Academy is, in a word, a school for spies. <---C>Cammie Morgan</---C> is a second-generation Gallagher girl--her mother, who also attended the school, is now the headmistress. Her two best friends, Liz and Bex, are both super-smart, and the best spies-in-training she knows (except for Liz's lack of coordination, but that's another story). Cammie has spent most of her life inside the walls of The Gallagher Academy, and now that another semester is starting, complete with new CoveOps teacher, hunky Joe Solomon, she's really looking forward to the new school year. But then things start to get a little out of control. Mr. Solomon seems to know all about Cammie's missing-and-presumed-dead father. She meets a boy in town, Josh, who finally sees her, really sees her, like no one else ever has. After all, she didn't get her nickname, \"the chameleon,\" for nothing. But now Cammie is balancing on a dangerous ledge--knowing that no one outside of the gates of The Gallagher Academy can ever know who she truly is, and wanting nothing more than to spill all of her secrets to Josh. As lies tangle with truths, as first love duels with obligation, Cammie will need to learn exactly what it means to be a spy, her mother's daughter, and a young girl falling in love. I'D TELL YOU I LOVE YOU, BUT THEN I'D HAVE TO KILL YOU is a wonderful, laugh-out-loud, action-adventure extravaganza. Filled with plenty of cool gadgets, intriguing teachers, and heart-pounding first-love moments to keep the reader interested, you won't be able to put this book down once you start. A true winner, and I definitely can't wait for a sequel! ...more I am a daydreamer\u2014I think most readers are. As a freshman in high school, I had a recurring fantasy about being a spy. At the time, I was taking Russian classes (back when the Cold War was a recent memory) and spent hours imagining what life would be like if I\u2019d been bred for espionage.

Her mother is a former spy, and her father died plying his trade. She attends Gallagher Academy, an all-female spy school, and knows over a dozen languages, several forms of martial arts, and the tango. Cammie is the epitome of female empowerment. So, why did this young adult novel leave me disappointed? I often had the sense that the book, the first in a series, is just a glorified screenplay. The action scenes\u2014and there are several\u2014do not play well on paper and seem better suited to the screen. In one scene, Cammie\u2019s friend, Liz, dangles precariously from a rooftop: \u201cShe tried to hang on to a gutter, but slipped, and soon she was swinging off the side of the . . . house\u201d (112). I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if Carter envisioned a movie as she wrote these scenes. I love young adult novels\u2014and sometimes I worry I still have the mentality of a 13-year-old. This book, though, allayed my fears. One of Cammie\u2019s teachers\u2014Mr. Solomon\u2014is a sexy former spy. I kept wishing for more of Mr. Solomon. I wondered if there was a possible romance brewing between him and Cammie's widowed mother. I cared more about his love life than Cammie\u2019s. And that is not a good sign. I am, officially, old. ...more I liked this book in the same way that I like the Princess Diaries movies (1 and 2). It's cute. It makes me feel warm and fuzzy. I giggle when it's witty. And when the lights come up (or I reach the back cover), there's a smile on my face. Cammie \"The Chameleon\" goes to a spy school. I mean, how cool is that! Yes, at times, the plot is cringe-worthy (I mean, the basic conflict is the fact that she can't tell the perfect boy that she can throw him to the pavement from six different positions), but I liked this book in the same way that I like the Princess Diaries movies (1 and 2).

Yes, at times, the plot is cringe-worthy (I mean, the basic conflict is the fact that she can't tell the perfect boy that she can throw him to the pavement from six different positions), but the dialogue is good, and you can tell that Ally really had a lot of fun with her concept. I think that's the key to young adult books: really falling in love with what you've created. Becoming so enamoured, so enthralled in the world your characters inhabit that it becomes a part of you, becomes the language in which you speak. Rowling did it (see Harry Potter), Riordan did it (see Percy Jackson), and Skye did it (see Leven Thumps). And, let's face it. It would make a beautiful movie. Much of the humor is situational, which translates really well to the screen, and the story is short enough that there won't be any need to remove important plot points (can anyone say Order of the Phoenix?)

The academy is there to train up girls who have the natural talent, intelligence or have the spy \u201cgenes\u201d running through their family. Cammie\u2019s life is pretty closed off, she\u2019s the last person to know anything despite her mum being head teacher of her school and she\u2019s never had a boyfriend. The Gallagher girls aren\u2019t really allowed to venture out of the academy unless they have prior permission to do so. Also on the outside world no one really knows what the Gallagher academy is really for. Most people assume it\u2019s a boarding school for snobby rich girls.

But the more time Cammie spends with him the more she realises she\u2019s falling for him, but will he still like her when he finds out everything she\u2019s told him is a lie? That she\u2019s not homeschooled but a Gallagher girl? And her friends think that she is mixing up priorities, are the Gallagher girls and becoming a spy; everything she\u2019s been brought up to do important or a boy? So why the 2.5 stars? I\u2019d tell you I love but then I\u2019d have to kill you was a funny humorous read and honestly that was the only reason I carried on reading the book until the end. The humour at times was a little immature for me and I think that\u2019s another reason I didn\u2019t enjoy it as much. I personally think that this would suit a much younger age group, I\u2019m sure that if I was still in high school I would have loved this series but now? Not so much. I also found my attention wavering a lot of the time whilst reading this, this may be because I couldn\u2019t really connect with the characters and also found the plot to be a bit predictable at times. I much prefer a story that keeps you on your toes and has some elements of surprise. I don\u2019t think I will continue with the rest of this series. I know some of you may say how can you give up after just the first book? But I find that unless a book really keeps my attention I am more likely to continue with it, which this book didn\u2019t really do. Thank you NetGalley and Disney-Hyperion for giving me the opportunity to read this book. ...more Just realized I never reviewed this one! Well, here it is....

Similar to Bex, Liz, and Macy, Josh lacks character depth, but he's supposed to be an average teenage boy, so his lack of depth is understandable...even though it was annoying. Nonetheless, his and Cammie's conversations were still enjoyable. The Setting The Gallagher Academy is practically the offspring of Hogwarts and Mademoiselle Geraldine's Finishing School. I'm really interested to discover the significance of all the hidden passages and chambers for the rest of the series. What I Loved - The characters were spectacular. They constantly kept me entertained - they're teenage girls, of course they're going to do some stupid things! Their anxiety, confusion, and complete ignorance of teenage guys cracked me up. - The story line was a simple, yet lively adventure. What at first seems clich\u00e9'd, is surprisingly unexpected and incredibly amusing. Carter does a marvelous job of taking a relatively stereotypical concept, and putting a unique spin on it. - The dialogue was marvelous. I loved all the references to movies and TV shows. - The spy elements weren't at all arduous to understand. This is a Middle Grade book - I don't want to have a ton of confusing terms shoved at me. In my opinion, a book written for younger audiences shouldn't be over-complicated. - The Gallagher Academy was an intriguing setting. I always like the idea of castles and manors filled with secrets. What I Didn't Love - The cover and title. I know, I know, don't judge a book by it's cover, but honestly, that's like saying don't eat a banana based on how brown it is. For the longest time I didn't read this book, purely because the title was pretty cheesy and the cover didn't look unique or very eye-catching. - As I mentioned earlier, Josh and the supporting characters lacked any development, whatsoever. The Verdict Well, it was pretty fantastic. \u00a0Great characters. Great dialogue. Great story. I can't wait to read the rest of the books...oh yeah, I'm reading them all! \u00a0I definitely think I would have liked this series even more if I read it when I was in middle school, but it's still entertaining no matter your age, in my opinion. ...more Okay, I was never expecting much from this book, especially after I saw that it had been optioned for a film by Disney.

But I was hoping for some James Bond/Cody Banks/Spy Kids action. This book is about Cammie Morgan, a student at the elite Gallagher Academy, which is essentially an all-girl school for spies. Cammie is a pretty normal student at Gallagher, besides the fact that her mother is the headmistress, and she has a reputation for being \"the Chameleon.\" Cammie knows fourteen languages and how to kill a man with a piece of uncooked spaghetti, but when it comes to boys, she's clueless. However, some boy advice will come in handy when she starts up a secret relationship with a normal boy- who thinks she is just a normal girl. This book was cute. Nothing more than that. It had some humor, not enough to make me laugh out loud, but enough to keep the mood light. That's the thing, I thought this book was TOO light. I never really bought in to any conflict. Don't you think in a book about spies, there should be some bad guys? Essentially, this book is about a girl who meets a boy. The spy stuff is just kind of tacked on. Cammie seemed more like a normal girl than a genius. But she did have a level head on her shoulders. But of course, all her friends wer super-model gorgeous while she is average looking. And she is the one with the boyfriend. Right. The characters and plot were all just a bit bland for me. Not much action to speak of. That was a tad disappointing. But there was some genuine guy advice, which readers will appreciate. I don't know. It's cute, light, and I'm sure tweenage girls will eat it up. I won't read the sequels though unless they fall into my hands. ...more It is actually really good. Not Twilight good, but it has a good story to it.

I figured that it would be something that I actually wanted to read. The first few chapters were explanatory, then after that Cammie meats Josh and you learn how hard it is for her to struggle against wanting to be with him and wanting to be a spy. Subjects, Themes, and Big Ideas: The theme of the book is Romance, about teenagers falling in love for the first time. But it also is about the girls of Gallagher Academy doing spy and secret CIA things. I really think that the big idea is being true to you while still being yourself and falling in love. Characters: Cammie: aka the chameleon, she blends in well with average a person which makes her a great spy. Bex: aka the Duchess, she is really strong and really smart, Cammie\u2019s best friend. Liz: aka Bookworm, has a photogenic memory, but writes down everything just to be on the safe side. Josh: aka the normal boy, just your normal town kid, who Cammie falls for and spies on. Plot summary: The girls at Gallagher Academy learn the basics of how to be a spy and work for the CIA. They don\u2019t socialize with outsiders, all there friends come from spy families. When a new teacher comes to school he sends the girls on a secret mission, Spy on their teacher, see what beverage he prefers with his funnel cake. When the mission goes wrong and Cammie ends up being left behind she meets Josh (a Normal Boy), and though she tries hard to forget him, he keeps turning up. Can Cammie fall in love with him and still be a spy? The end of the book leaves you hanging and wanting more! Strengths (including reviews and awards): The book has been picked up by Disney to be possibly made into a movie. Drawbacks or other cautions: I really don\u2019t see any drawbacks or cautions to this book. I think that it is a simple and enjoyable read. Teaching ideas: I think that I would use this in a much younger classroom, maybe in home economics. I think that it would teach girls that falling in love is okay but you still have to be true to yourself. ...more V\u00cdTEJTE V TAJN\u00ddCH SLU\u017dB\u00c1CH.

Was a free audiobook download via SYNC . I tried but I am just not in the mood to listen to this narrator. Her \"teen\" voice sounds childish and forced and more like a tween and it is grating on every single one of my frayed nerves. I may get back to this some day when I'm less grouchy. But probably not. The book may be fab, nothing against the book, but I just can't do it right now. When I was younger I loved \"Totally Spies\" and \"Spy kids\". Having these shows combined with a teenage girl going to boarding school? Pretty awesome. I'd Tell You But Then I'd Have To Kill You is a fascinating action and suspenseful novel told from a diary perspective of a young girl named Cameron Morgan.

Cameron (who prefers to be called Cammie) is actually a teenage \"spy in training\" with the weight of a spy family legacy pressing down on her shoulders. Though now matter how trained and gifted she may be, there is one thing that no teenage girl can escape, her first crush. During one of Cammies's training missions, she falls in love with a ordinary town boy named Josh. That's when Cammie's real mission begins. Torn beteen her loyalty to her espionage and the promise of love, Cammie must make a descision...With her mother as the academy's head mistress, and teachers watching her every move, the stakes are high. Can she handle her spy life and her love life without spilling the beans to Josh and knowing that around him, she can never really be herself? After all, if she told him the truth, she'd have to kill him. I recommend this this book to people who love suspense with a hint of romance, or yearn for an admirable heroine. It was my first time trying out a mystery and suspense type book so even though I can't make a connection from this book to another book or sires, it definitely did not let me down. I loved the book's suspense and romance, though I think it took it a bit too far on the discripition on one of Cammie's missions. It made it become scary instead of adrenaline full and suspensful, which is what I belive is the feeling the author was trying to convey. Despite all this, I loved this book and couldn't put it down! At times it had my heart rapidly pounding, though on the other hand, at times it had me squealing or simply had me laughing out loud. It also deeply reminded me of the movie Spy Kids with more girl power. Cammie Morgan is the new Hermione Granger ( without the wand)! ...more Idea of spies? Awesome. Idea of a forbidden romance? Not so much. In the end, the idea of spies won out and I read the book that I'd been staring at on the library shelf for a while. Verdict? I am so glad I did. Those Gallagher Girls are cool. They're all geniuses. They're all trained in fighting defense. They have a screen program which tells them what languages they're allowed to speak during lunchtimes.

The characters were really strong. While there is nothing particularly unique about Cammie, she's still a fun person. I think her total and utter unique-less-ness was part of the story. Reading about her is great. Thinking about her, she probably won't win any \"Heroine-of-the-year\" awards, but all the same, she's pretty cool. Who wouldn't want to be a Chameleon who could blend anywhere? Cammie's friends were pretty cool, too. Liz was great. Absolute super genius, but absolute super klutz. (Sounds like me. Except for the super genius part. Moving on.) Bex, well, you wouldn't want to get into a fight with her. And Macey? I don't like Macey. While she's not catty, she's just not nice. An another thing I liked: the Gallagher Girls are your usual high-school girls from your average book, but they're not catty. It's like the Gallagher Sisters thing really strengthened them, and being a genius means you don't have to be nasty. The plot wasn't the type of action you'd attribute to spies... it was slower than that. While it had enough spy-action to satisfy, it didn't have enough to be awesome. It was a romance. That was the plot. On the romantic element, it was very clean (I was worried about it being mushy), and overall, I was impressed. Josh was a pretty nice guy, so yeah. It was good. I was impressed with the language. While most teen books these days feel the need to shove in a few coarse words, on the whole, this book did very well with that. At the beginning, there was one, represented by blanks (and a starting letter, so you know what the word is. That's a bit annoying, it kind of defeats the purpose of having blanks.) However, overall, it wasn't too bad. I loved it how Cammie had a great relationship with her mum, an ex CIA agent, who runs the academy. I love it how her dad wasn't a faded out piece of junk because he was dead (dead parents in books do that so often.) Apparently putting parents into the story is becoming more common these days. Good trend. At times they spoke in other languages, without a very descriptive translation, and the writing didn't make things clear. I read fast, so I had to assume stuff and re-read paragraphs. There were also a few ironies that I didn't pick up immediately, but a reader who concentrated would get them all, I think. So there were a few holes, but on the main part, I liked the writing. The style was snappy-normal-person-talk (always fun to read.) Cammie was slightly sarcastic (I love sarcastic protagonists) and all up, yes, a very good book. ...more This cute teen novel was a nice start to the Gallagher Girl series.

The book was also written in a cute, juvenile way that most pre teens will adore. However, I felt like this was a bit too young for me, so I just kept rolling my eyes. I adored the plot. It was original, well developed, and smart. I loved how the girls were spies, and the mansion they studied in was a great setting! (It reminded me of Hogwarts, so think Harry Potter for girls! But no magic, haha). There was also well used conflict, and moments that will bring tears to your eyes. However, there were quite a few things I didn't like. The writing sounded very juvenile, and it would appeal to someone younger. The author constantly used capitalization for emphasis, which I thought was very immature. Also, the author would add in parenthetical asides after sentences and write some cheesy thing to go with it, intended to make the reader laugh. It didn't work very well... Also, the INSTA-LOVE. Ugh. :( It bugs me to no end when a book has insta love between the protagonist and her/his love interest. Cammie and Josh's relationship was so little developed, and Josh was so forgettable. I couldn't even picture what he looked like. Overall, it was a great story that teens will love. Despite the insta love and juvenile writing, the premise was clever, and that is why it is so popular.

Oh no, these girls go through Covert Operations, and Culture and Assimilation. Cammie is a fantastic character. I really enjoyed reading her thoughts and ngl I found myself literally LOLing at parts. She\u2019s the perfect mix of confident and self-conscious, smart and not-so-smart. Her two best friends are freaking adorable. Bex is a hardass British babe who is not afraid to get down and dirty. Liz is the kind of girl who does extra credit homework over the summer holidays and is deathly afraid of field work. I might have my gay-goggles on but I ship them. Then, just to shake things up a little, Macey enters the fold. She truly is a privileged little snot who has been kicked out of an indeterminate number of boarding schools before landing at Gallagher Girls.

And not just because of the relationship she has with her daughter (which is perf and I can\u2019t wait to see more of it). And I\u2019d also be down if these two did the do.

It was such a quick and light read, and I was grinning throughout a good 9/10s of it (the 1/10 missing was from the beginning when I was still getting a feel for the book). Sure the plot is basic. Sure it can seem a little juvenile at times. But it\u2019s funny. The characters are charming. The worldbuilding is super interesting. It\u2019s just an all round great read.

And Cammie is very good when it comes to spy stuff, but when she meets a boy, Josh, and pretends to be a normal girl for his sake, things get interesting and complicated. The thing that I LOVE about this book is the focus that it puts on the friendship between girls. Despite the fact that Cammie\u2019s adventures revolve around Josh, the heart of this book is the relationship between Cammie and her friends and her mother. I love how girl-centered this book is, because we need more books like this: books that show girls are kick ass, are smart, can be spies while being feminine and girly at the same time, are close with each other and have each other\u2019s backs. The only other book that gave me the same feeling was Vampire Academy, because of Rose and Lissa\u2019s friendship (speaking of VA, go read that series, okay?). The writing is so so funny. It\u2019s easy to follow, but alluring at the same time. I flew through this and I could have easily read it in one sitting, with enough time. It\u2019s just all around fun, witty and it made me feel warm and fuzzy. If you\u2019re looking for something contemporary and easy to read, look no further and give this book a try.

My fav part is the friendships and Cammie & Rachel's mother-daughter relationship (I already cried twice over them; yeaaaa i was told that the first two are fluffy but THERE IS NOTHING FLUFFY ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO STOP THE TEARS OKAY; it's MOSTLY fluffy though (\u25e1\u203f\u25e1\u273f)). A few notes: I wish that we had been shown a bit more of Macey's shift into this group of friends; Cammie's narrative claims that there are \"girls of all shapes and sizes and skin color\" but Bex is the only canon girl mentioned with darker skin color (where are girls of Asian, Latin, Arabian origin?) and all the girls that have a bit more description about them are described as very lean and pretty (except Cammie but her opinion on herself is highly biased). So this is one thing I hope either disappears in claims or is developed, because saying that there are girls like this, but no actual proof? Eh. Plus showing/telling & representation are different things altogether. There was something else I wanted to mention but I can't remember.. Probably irrelevant then. Anyhoooow, I really liked this and I can't wait to read more *retreats into reading cave with book 2* ...more See this review and more at 26 Countless Possibilities I had been wanting a change from my normal high action, fantasy or dystopian reads.

That\u2019s not to say I wish something other than a relationship drove the plot, it was cute enough. There were many unrealistic elements, but then again, this book revolves around a school or teenage spies. Not exactly the most realist thing, but fun all the same. The Writing Cammie tells the story in a very casual way. It\u2019s written like she is talking to the reader. I know this doesn\u2019t work in all cases, but it is very appropriate here. Things I liked Without giving anything away, this book touched on misperceptions. There was a particular character the girls initially hated, but as things evolved, they learned to get along and even go to that character for advice. I also liked the theme about making choices even if that means letting go of something. Favorite Character Bex was my favorite character in this story. She often provided humor to the story line. She also stood beside her friends the whole way through the story. Other Thoughts This is a very cute, fun read. I\u2019ve heard that this series starts out slow, and improves with each book. I would read the next book anyway, but this makes me more interested in continuing! I\u2019m actually halfway through the second book now, and enjoying it even more than this book! :) Content : The plot revolves around romance, so lots of handholding and one non-descriptive kiss. Words like \u201chot\u201d and \u201csexy\u201d are used quite a bit. One of the girls uses the \u201cB-word\u201d (used in text like in the quotes, not actually written) ...more Love Love Loved this.

Cammie and her friends have to learn how to break out of their little protective bubble Gallagher Academy has given them and experience the real world. This year there is a new teacher (who I loved by the way) that is making school much harder. He is cute, a well known spy, and has hilarious missions for the girls to go on. There are a lot of silly and cute missions in this book that by the time the action kicks in you're like \"Woah what just happened?\" The writing itself was at times great and others fairly weak but the majority of the time it had me bursting out laughing. I love Ally Carter\u2019s Uncommon Criminals series, and this one while not as mature and thought out was just as good. I loved the way the results of spying on Josh (the main love interest) were given to you in spy reports. Amount of bubble gum chewed, what flavor, what brand of toilet paper he uses etc. It was so cute and fluffy that I couldn\u2019t pass it up. This basically sums up the plot: So basically, if you can get around the fact that the whole plot is surrounded around the idea that Cammie has to pretend to be someone else to date Josh, and the hilarity that ensues, I think you would enjoy reading this. Give it a try. I for one am giving it four out of five stars for all of the times that I giggled and shrieked like a little girl. ...more I'd Tell You I Love You, But Then I'd Have to Kill You Review by Ally Carter Why did I like this book?

I can\u2019t ever see them actually condoning something like that. And yet, I liked it. I read this book. I liked it. The pages turned. I felt a great gush of \u201cahhhhhhhhhhh\u201d from reading a good book. My liking the book greatly overrode my ability to dislike it. It was that good.
