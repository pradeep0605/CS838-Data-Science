That the books that come later are much better and SO worth it, but frankly, I heard you have a kid, and a vampire ex-girlfriend in the refrigerator, and that's just not part of my 5-year plan. I'm sure that somewhere out there is an amazing reader who loves you for who you are - 300 pages of a main character who has worse days than Jack Bauer, constantly finding that LAST OUNCE of strength to fight, and then another ounce, and one more ounce, and an ounce in the back pocket you were holding onto for the penultimate chapter. So, you know, it's not you; it's me. I'm just not jiving to what you're offering. We can still stay friends, though, because I've heard your friend Codex Alera is kind of cool, and I wouldn't mind hanging out with him maybe. And if anyone tells you that this is because I've already been hanging out with a different wizard named Harry, you leave that sweet British boy out of this, Dresden. ...more Reviewed by: Rabid Reads BR with my peeps at: Buddies Books and Baubles Specifically: Robin (Bridge Four) , Jenny , Lila , and Steven 3.5 stars GRAVE PERIL was a kind of awkward installment.

A year has passed since the end of FOOL MOON, and in the interim, not only have Harry and Susan stayed together and are now in a committed relationship, but at some point Harry and our favorite officers of law enforcement have taken down a Bad Guy sorcerer who was using a demon, teenagers, drugs, orgies, and did I mention, a DEMON, to wreak various havocs in Chicago, the latter continually brought up in vague references . . . And that vaguely referenced takedown is the source of this book's plot. But we weren't there for that takedown, so it feels like we're missing something; that the \u201cvague references\u201d are vague b/c we already have the 411, and more detailed explanations aren't necessary . . . Even though I knew, I KNEW, that, no , I had not accidentally skipped an installment, I found myself constantly wanting to check and make sure (*whispers* again ). Beyond that I had a (gaping) handful of other small issues, beginning with the fact that I don't like ghosts. That's part of why I'm not much for steampunk: the Victorian obsession with contacting the dead is often inseparable from the gadgetry. And the concept of malicious spirits that are strong enough to physically harm the living . . .<---F> is rather horrific</---F>. Mostly b/c I can't get past the \"dead\" part. I mean, what do you do when your attacker can't be killed or stopped. . . b/c ALREADY DEAD?! Like Harry himself says: There should be some kind of rule against needing to kill anything more than once. If there's a Winchester handy, then well and good, but I don't have a Sam or a Dean in my back pocket (mores the pity). I'm not much for vampires either. Oh, there are versions that I like well enough, but in truth they're merely at the top of the \"Dead Things\" list. And these vampires . . . if someone told me the colloquialism \"bat shit crazy\" had its origins in this series . . . I would believe them. Entirely. Then there's Michael . . . Michael is the illusive true Man of God. Were he a real man, I would not be surprised if he \"walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.\" Like Enoch. Which can be uncomfortable, but mostly it's dull. And hard to like. Everything is very black and white to Michael, who is demonstrably disappointed in Harry for beating his Faerie Godmother at her own game (that would be manipulation of words and intent, aka tricking ), when the alternative is to allow her to literally own him . . . By the end, he was easier to deal with, but I'm honestly not sure it that's b/c he got toned down, or b/c I really liked his wife, which made me like him more by default. It's also starting to irritate me how little consistency there is to Harry's abilities. A pattern seems to be forming: x happens, leaving Harry practically powerless, then y happens, not only re-energizing him, but giving him a surplus of power as well. Furthermore, many of the times Harry\u2019s been depleted, he somehow manages to \"dig a little deeper\" and accomplish the same kinds of things he'd be able to do were he not depleted. There's always some searing pain that accompanies these feats, presumably to account for the power surge in the midst of weakness, but as Harry seems to recover from his injuries at a remarkable rate, it feels like smoke and mirrors. (<------HA!) I'm not saying Harry should never encounter obstacles that inhibit his ability to wizard. BUT. If it continues to happen in every, single book . . . *frowns* Lastly, Harry says, \"Hell's bells,\" twenty-eight times. So I had a LOT of problems with this book. BUT . . . I still really enjoyed it. B/c no matter what plot point or character issues I had, I immensely enjoy Butcher's writing. When he's not being a gross boy (b/c GORE. Yes!)---do not ask, I refuse to relive it, but I will say this: if you've already read this book, the fork in the WTF? button should have special meaning---he's created an immensely engaging character in Harry, and between his amazing feats of wizardry and, yes, his adorkableness, I find myself able to stamp down the less-than-thrilling aspects of his story. Plus now there are also interesting plot developments and new characters to counter the mounting exasperation. Like Thomas. I friggin' LOVE Thomas. Speaking of Thomas, this is an example of the excellent writing that holds me in thrall: The first sound to ring out was neither gunshot nor battle cry, but rich, silvery laughter. It drifted up, masculine, somehow merry and mocking, bubbling and scornful all at once. I squinted down through the lights, to see Thomas, posed like some bizarre post-chrysalis incarnation of Errol Flynn, one foot up on the stairs, hand braced, his other hand on the crystalline hilt of his sword. His head was thrown back, every lean line of muscle on him displayed with the casual disregard of skilled effort. Bob is also a consistent source of hilarity, AND there was a (view spoiler) [ DRAGON. (hide spoiler) ] So clearly it wasn't all, or even mostly, bad, and with SUMMER KNIGHT, the almost universally acknowledged game changer up next, there's no way I'm stopping now.

So I'll just cut the crap and tell you why this series went from Oooh Yeah I Want More Land (OYIWML\u2122) to I don't Give a Damn What Happens Next Territory (IDGaDWHNT\u2122): \u2718 Because the writing is sub-par . \u2718 Because it feels like the book was written 20 years ago , not in 2008. \u2718 Because the plot is boring . And dull . And uninteresting . \u2718 Because everytime Harry said \"Hell's bells\" I eyerolled my little self to death and felt like smashing my Kindle against the nearest wall. \u2718 Because this book made me feel like I'd missed an instalment in the series. \u2718 Because blah blah blah and blah killed the story. \u2718 Because I cannot stand Michael, Charity, their freaking righteousness , and incessant, exasperating, ever-moralizing religious speeches .

In my view. - I typically don't like ghost stories, so there's that. - I don't like religious fanaticism, and one of the main supporting characters in this is one, so there's that. - This feels like it was written a long time ago, with the goofy things Harry says. Don't you say it again! ... Hell's Bells! I know it's just me, but also, I think it's kind of cheesy how the non-physical realm is called the Nevernever. I just don't think this series is for me. This is the third one I've tried. No one can say I didn't try. This one is even worse than the first two. I at least made it to the end of those ! Everyone says it gets better. There has nevernever , okay only ever ever one time, been a series that actually did get better as it went along and that was The Hollows series by Kim Harrison. Anyways, almost everyone else loves this series. It's just me. I read books wrong all the time. I'm throwing the towel in on this one. Buddy Read Fail!

In my first review for The Dresden Files I threatened to send my underwear collection to Jim Butcher as a heavy fangirl thank you for creating something so mindblowing than our boy Harry. This caused one fellow reviewer to speculate that perhaps I did not go through with my threats as Butcher never blogged about receiving a collection of quality lingerie. This is something I gotta agree with. My delicates would without a doubt be something to write about, which is why I probably did not live up to my words. Maybe. And as much I still think Butcher is worthy of many more underwear collections with his wonderful, imaginative world building that makes me want to dedicate a lot of my precious reading time to him, the real reason why I always come back so quickly, not to mention me actually re-reading something, is the fantastic narration of James Marsters. Marsters has to be a God of Narrators. The way he develops through each book, bringing our boy Harry to life with his laid back, sexy, casual, friend-to-friend style is remarkable. He does his job so well, he becomes Harry. He is Harry, there is no Spike left in him. This is the role of which I shall remember him. However, all this brings an important question to the surface. If Butcher (hypothetically speaking) is, in fact, the new and proud owner of my lace beauties, what is one to send to Mr. Marsters as a thank you for his excellent, heart dropping performance? ...more The spirit world has gone postal over Chicago, and ghosts are causing havoc.

The first two novels were good, but this third one was even better. Dresden should be likable by now, and so should the other recurring main characters. Michael was a great addition to the team. I'm not sure if he's in it for the long run, but the Harry-Michael team was a very fun read. The plot thickens in this novel because Butcher gave it more depth. A lot of plot twists here and there, and more magic. As an UF novel with a wizard as the main character, magic should be copious. It was copious in this novel, and I finally saw what Harry could do with his powers. I was complaining then that the author didn't focus on that, but this novel was not a let down. In the first and second novels, the author introduced the Giant scorpions, Oversexed vampires, and Psychotic werewolves. To be honest I wanted the scorpions to make their reappearance, but necessary for the plot, we got the oversexed vampires. I wasn't shocked that Bianca made a reappearance because by now you should know that Harry had unfinished business with her. The vampires here were a bit violent, and I liked them a bit. A little more violence and that would be perfect. The main antagonist here would be the ghosts, but Butcher introduced 2 main villains. I don't want to spoil so let's just say both the main villains were violent and fun to read. The ending was a bit cheesy, but not enough to annoy me. 4.5/5 stars. I liked this better than the first one. Amazing characters and the plot improved a lot. Time to continue on with the rest of the series. ...more Buddy read April 20th on Buddies Books and Baubles with Jessica , Ashley , Lege , Steven , Sh3lly & oOSarahOo they is a little behind but still here , and Jenny as out official stalker this time.

Why is Harry pulling ahead? Well it could be the addition of some great new characters. Bigger badder baddies and a tragic star-crossed romance. I actually didn\u2019t care about the romance so much until the VERY end but the other stuff was fantastic. Who are these fantastic side characters? \u03de Michael \u03de \u2013 THE FIST OF GOD - is a fantastic addition. Everything he does is good and moral and he has a magic sword no not that kind ladies get your minds out of the gutter he is married It is an actual sword that he fights for God with. AMAZING. _____ hand touched Michael\u2019s steel-clad arm\u2014 and erupted into sudden, white flame, as brief and violent as a stroke of lightning . She screamed, a piercing wail, and fell back from him to the ground. She lay there, curled helplessly around her blackened hand, struggling to get enough breath back to scream. Kyle flew to her side. I looked at Michael and blinked. \u201cWow,\u201d I said. \u201cColor me impressed.\u201d Michael looked vaguely embarrassed. \u201cIt happens like that sometimes,\u201d he said, apologetically. \u2745Lea\u2745 - Harry\u2019s Faery Godmother, who wants to get the rest of his soul and turn him into part of her pack of dogs. She is one of the new bigger badder baddies I mentioned and she is the nice one. Which reminds me NEVER MAKE A DEAL WITH THE FAE\u2026have we learned nothing. No good can come from it. She is beautiful and deadly and ready to treat Harry like a dog\u2026.literally \u2656Thomas\u2656 - Member of the White vampire court and a good liar to boot. Is he a friend and ally or is he another trap waiting to happen. Currently it might be a little unclear. He is fun though and another great addition. \u201cBecause you can trust me,\u201d he(Thomas) said. \u201cI want to help you.\u201d I snorted. \u201cWhy the hell should I believe you?\u201d \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t. I\u2019m a good liar. One of the best. I\u2019m not asking you to believe me. Believe the circumstances. We have a common interest.\u201d \u2620 BOB \u2620 - Okay technically Bob isn\u2019t new but he is my favorite side character and he gets the best lines. Every time he is on page my highlighter goes a little crazy. I\u2019m so happy to see that he keeps up that witty dialogue and propensity for romance novels and sex in this book as well. \u201cYou want work, we make a deal. I want to do a ridealong the next time Susan comes over.\u201d I snorted at him. \u201cHell\u2019s bells, Bob, don\u2019t you ever think about anything besides sex? No. I\u2019m not letting you into my head while I\u2019m with Susan.\u201d The skull spat out an oath. \u201cThere should be a union. We could renegotiate my contract.\u201d And finally \u03de Charity \u03de \u2013 Eight month pregnant wife to THE FIST OF GOD\u2026.Micheal. I loved her immediately the first time she lit into Harry. Okay so she doesn\u2019t get a big part in this book but I can already tell she will be downright amazing in future books. Plus she and Michael have an amazing beginning story\u2026At least I think it is amazing since He slayed a fire-breathing dragon to save her Okay there are a few more very interesting characters that get a little page time including Ferro a dragon in human form, Mavra, of the Black Court of Vampires and a walking Nightmare. Really there is a lot going on. The story was better plotted out this time and I found myself much more drawn into it. Harry is still that bumbling guy that can\u2019t seem to catch a break and when one thing goes wrong they all go wrong. There was a new obstacle around every corner and he caused plenty of trouble that will have many repercussions going into the next book. Normally I'd be all over the romance and what happened in the end with that...but maybe it is because I know there are 15 books out already I'm trying not to get too attached or maybe it is because I really love Murphy and think she is the long term play I have no idea if she is or isn't and I don't read any of the blurbs cuz I want it to be a surprised so don't tell me I want to keep my ship as long as possible . I didn't really connect with Susan until the very end of this book and thought that is a great way to take the story. I love/hate it all at the same time. Like I'm supposed to. So lets just recap\u2026.Harry in this book manages to get in deep trouble with: \u2714 God \u2013 Or the Fist of God - Micheal \u2714 At least one court of vampires but probably 2 of them \u2714 The Wizard Council \u2714 His girlfriend \u2013 Susan \u2714 Some ghosts \u2714 A Walking Nightmare \u2714 His Faery Godmother \u2714 And Charity\u2026 I\u2019d be the most afraid of Charity Sure some of it he gets out of\u2026but that is a lot of trouble so I expect that the majority of it lingers. This series is definitely looking up. ...more 2.5ish stars. An improvement over the last book, but still not quite making good on the promising potential of the first book. I definitely like this better than Fool Moon . I feel like it flows more naturally... Or maybe the story itself is just more interesting?

The central plot here introduces just another freak of the week. I do appreciate the introduction of at least a few major status quo changes and some plot lines that Butcher can start to thread throughout the series. To be perfectly honest, I don't think these books are particularly well written. Some of the dialogue is awful. Butcher should only be allowed to put Harry on the brink of death so many times. It was like 12 in this book alone. It would be hilarious to play a drinking game while reading. Every time Harry is convinced he's going to die; every time Harry says \"Hell's bells!\"; every time a ridiculously over-sexualized woman is introduced (double if Harry comments on her breasts). I think the characters are mainly idiots and make stupid choices for no discernible reasons. Harry still doesn't feel genuine to me. He's a stock concept: sarcastic, wannabe-hard-boiled-gumshoe who cracks jokes and spouts off catchphrases on cue; misogynistic but fancies himself a gentleman. I have no idea what motivates him to make certain dumb decisions other than that we're supposed to just accept at face value that he's a noble, self-sacrificing dude even though there are no previous indicators to suggest this. Peter David did this character so much better with Jamie Madrox in X-Factor, Vol. 1: The Longest Night . Why am I still reading this series, then? I kind of like it in spite of everything haha. It's fun and easy and still just barely good enough to make me think it will get better. Hopefully it gets better... ...more <+++>Grave Peril</+++> 3 Stars Many have stated that <+++>Grave Peril</+++> is the turning point in the series for the better. After considering the plot and the characters, I must confess that I found Fool Moon to be far more entertaining. Don't get me wrong. Harry and his quirks are very endearing but a number of issues irritated me in this installment. First, Murphy barely makes an appearance and the absence of a strong willed, take no prisoners, female character detracts from the overall effect of the story. Second Grave Peril 3 Stars Many have stated that Grave Peril is the turning point in the series for the better. After considering the plot and the characters, I must confess that I found Fool Moon to be far more entertaining. Don't get me wrong. Harry and his quirks are very endearing but a number of issues irritated me in this installment. First, Murphy barely makes an appearance and the absence of a strong willed, take no prisoners, female character detracts from the overall effect of the story. Second, the criticism surrounding Harry's chauvinism finally makes sense. In the first two books, his attitude toward women comes across as gallant and even chivalrous, but the chauvinism is front and center in this one as Harry fixates on the breasts and luscious curves of virtually every female character - is this really necessary? Third, while the basic plot is compelling and the action scenes exciting, the execution is repetitive. How many times must Harry battle the Nightmare before he defeats it? How many times must he get round the machinations of his fairy Godmother? How many times must he be exposed to the lustful effects of vampire venom? How many times must his powers fail him precisely when he needs them the most? Come on already, get some new material. Finally, Harry constantly blames himself for the choices others make that get them into trouble. While this overdeveloped sense of guilt may have its place in the portrayal of Harry's internal struggle with his own conscience, it starts to grate on the nerves after a while. On a more positive note, the secondary characters both old and new are very engaging. Michael, a Knight of the Cross, constitutes an intriguing counterpoint to Harry's irreligious personality, and the manner in which Butcher depicts the power of Christian artifacts adds another layer of complexity to the world building. That said, Michael is a little too self-righteous and condescending for my tastes. There are also some poignant moments between Harry and his reporter girlfriend, Susan Rodriguez, although her misguided Lois Lane routine is getting old and she has never really appealed to me as Harry's love interest. The most interesting characters, however, are Lea, Harry's rather scary fairy Godmother, who serves as a cautionary tale about what happens when one makes ill advised bargains with the fae, and Thomas, the morally ambiguous vampire who plays a pivotal role in Harry's conflict with the various villains in the story. All in all, the world building is strong, the story has potential and the unanswered questions are interesting enough to keep on with the series. ...more I rarely feel the urge to read books in the \u201curban fantasy\u201d subgenre.

As a result, one of Harry Dresden\u2019s friends has been driven mad, and another one in a coma. In order to save his friends Harry and a few friends have to battle ghosts, demons, ghosts of demons , and more vampires than you can shake a garlic bread at. Another reason I seldom read urban fantasy is that\u2014for me\u2014it requires even more suspension of disbelieve than the standard \u201csword & sorcery\u201d fantasy. The setting is \u201cour world\u201d but with a magical component welded on, so the wizardry and monstrosities goings-on seem just a little ridiculous. I think this is the advantage of sci-fi, we live in a scientific world so even when the science is made-up (or just plain wrong) the fiction often has a ring of plausibility. Having said that, I have to admit I was pretty much sold on Grave Peril from the battle with a ghost a few pages in. It starts with a wonderfully creepy atmosphere and sudden escalation into a magical battle that is so kinetic and intense I forgot how ludicrous the whole premise is. In order to get the most out of the book, I decided to commit to the nonsense and just go along on Jim Butcher\u2019s wild ride. It does help that Butcher is very good at his chosen field, the internal logic or \u201cmagic system\u201d that he employs is consistent and believable within the setting he creates. Also, the pacing of the book is so fast that my habitual disbelief has no time to surface. Then there is the characterization. \u201cBut I\u2019m a sucker for a lady in distress. I always have been. It\u2019s a weak point in my character, a streak of chivalry a mile wide and twice as deep.\u201d I have had enough of anti-heroes, but a flawed hero with his heart in the right place is someone I can get behind. His sidekick Michael Carpenter, a \u201cKnight of the Cross\u201d, is also very interesting. If he was the protagonist of the series, it would probably have fallen under the \u201cChristian fiction\u201d label. \u201cHe\u2019s a righteous man.\u201d \u201cHe seemed nice enough to me.\u201d \u201cNo, not self-righteous. Righteous. The real deal. He\u2019s honest, loyal, faithful. He lives his ideals. It gives him power.\u201d\u201d The pacing of the book is quite relentless and it almost never slows down to take a breather. Harry faces one crisis after another and almost dies every time, and more often than not he survives by coming up with outlandish solutions that sometimes feel like deus ex machina. The continuous battling does become a little repetitious by the end of the book but never actually boring, thanks to Jim Butcher\u2019s narrative skills. If I say \u201cturn your brain off and enjoy this book\u201d it would sound like a backhanded compliment that implies the book is stupid. It maybe silly, but it is certainly not stupid. Jim Butcher put a lot of thoughts into his world building, characterization and plotting, but it seems like he has done all the heavy lifting and the reader does not need to make any real effort to follow the story. By the end of the book, I felt quite satisfied and look forward to reading many more of Harry Dresden's ridiculous adventures. ___________________ Worldbuilding Quotes: These are examples of Jim Butcher's elaborate world building rather than passages of literary beauty (of which there is none, it's not that kind of book). \u201cNot a house,\u201dI said. \u201cA home. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d\u201cSo what about Victor Sells\u2019s place? I hear you took him on, right?\u201dI shook my head. \u201cHe\u2019d screwed up his threshold. He was running his business out of it, using the place for dark ceremonies. It wasn\u2019t a home anymore.\u201d In the circles of the supernatural community, an Old World code of conduct still ruled. When you have a problem, you settle it face to face, within the circle. Working magic directly on a human body is difficult. It\u2019s very difficult. Conjuring up forces, like my shield, or elemental manifestations like the fire or wind is a snap compared to the complexity and power required to change someone\u2019s hair a different color\u2014or to cause the cells on either side of an injury to fuse back together, closing it.\u201d ___________________ Funny Quotes: \u201cDead before the sun rises,\u201d I said. \u201cStars, Bob, why don\u2019t you just go all the way over the melodramatic edge and tell me that I\u2019m going to be sleeping with the fishes?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure that much of you would be left,\u201d Bob said, \u201cWell,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI\u2019d like to see this. I\u2019ve never seen an external transformation before. Do proceed, madame.\u201d He waved his hand impatiently. \u201cDog him, already!\u201d (There are many more of course). ...more In the third installment of the Dresden Files ghosts are terrorizing the streets of Chicago and with the Ghost-busters nowhere to be found Harry Dresden is called upon to swing into action.

This was the strongest installment in the series so far for me. The first half dragged in places as I missed some of the cool secondary characters from previous books (Murphy and Johnny Marcone being the most notable). However the second half of the book picked up in a big way: the vampire ball sequence was probably the highlight of the series so far for me with the introduction of some really intriguing characters, some cool moments, big revelations about the plot, and an air of tension throughout that culminated in an awesome action scene. Definitely the high point of this series so far for me. There was some cool world-building in this one with a focus on ghosts. I liked how the world-building worked with the plot (view spoiler) [ especially how Harry used the thinned barrier between the real and spirit realm as his ace in the hole in the final showdown, which was incidentally an awesome and really well put together fight scene (hide spoiler) ] . The development of the different vampire courts and fae were also interesting. The characters in this one were somewhat disappointing towards the start. While Michael, Harry's newly introduced sidekick, had some cool moments he had as many moments of being preachy and self-righteous. And his wife was even worse, constantly losing her shit at Harry for decisions made solely by her husband: a grown ass man capable of looking after himself. However I found Harry's godmother to be a sinister and intriguing villain who provided a sense of danger to the story, which was just as well since the other villain was a 2-D panto-villain moron. Later in the book the introduction of Thomas, a morally ambiguous vampire who forms an uneasy alliance with Harry, was a massive boost to the story and I really hope to see more of him, especially as he serves as an awesome contrast to Harry's frequently annoying goody-two-shoes self righteous behavior. Despite the weak start this was probably my favourite installment in the series so far and the strong ending has left me excited to see how the series will continue on from here. ...more I will probably have to find a print version, as I kept getting distracted from the story and am fairly certain I missed huge chunks of plot.

Also, I love James Marsters and could listen to him talk to me for hours, but if he has to say Hell's Bells ONE more time, I may be tempted to punch him. Or Jim Butcher, who deserves it more. ...more I loved aspects of this story and hated others. I adored the magic, the description of how power worked, how Harry created his spells. I also loved how he got put through the wringer and had to really be willing to sacrifice himself for the survival of the people he loved. I hated the female characters.

(She is supposed to be smart, so why does she do something so moronic?) I feel like the women are all selfish sex objects. The writing technique is mostly clean and conversational with a few dips into purple prose, but I noticed the tendency to hurtle up to a tipping point, end the chapter, and then draw way, way back into a philosophical musing at the beginning of the next chapter rather than continuing with the action. I would have liked that on occasion, but not chapter after chapter. So even though I rated it a three (because of the icky representation of women), I really loved certain elements of the book, and reading the way it was worded and constructed helped me wrap my head around the way I approach writing myself, what works for me and what doesn't. ...more I felt strange after reading this book.

Murphy didn't feature much in this instalment but there was an interesting moment when Harry's wizard Sight revealed her in a pretty spectacular manner. Harry's relationship with Susan hit both a high and low-point, and the events during the climax are going to lead to some serious consequences to our Wizard P.I. While I felt a bit mixed about this book, curiosity and love for the supernatural will keep me reading the series for now. ...more This review can also be found at Carole's Random Life .

The series seems to really be taking off at this point and the story was very well done. I completely enjoyed every moment that I spent listening to this book during my re-read. Harry Dresden's life is anything but boring. This book starts with a bang and really doesn't slow down until the end. I love how many different things can come together to make sense in Harry's world. In this book, there are ghosts, demons, and vampires all mixed together and it flows smoothly. The mystery was pretty complex in this one with a lot of things happening that will be brought up again as the series moves forward. I had a hard time setting this one aside. I am so in love with the characters. Harry is awesome in his own way. He is funny and able to think on his feet. He makes decisions based not only on what is best for him but what will be best for others. He risks himself to helps other people quite often. Michael played a large role in this book and I really enjoyed his character. It was really fun to go back and see some of my favorite characters early in the series. Karin, Bob, Susan and everyone else really all added important pieces to the story as well. James Marsters is the perfect voice of Harry Dresden. I absolutely love how this book was narrated. He didn't just read the story - he performed it. I could totally hear every one of Harry's emotions in the performance. I was really impressed that even the perfectly placed breath seem to add to the delivery. He performed all of the different characters flawlessly. I can't wait to listen to more books narrated by James Marsters. I would highly recommend this series to fans of urban fiction. This is a series that you will want to read in order since there are some story arc that carry over from previous books. I am looking forward to listening to book four in the series very soon. Initial Thoughts Loved it! I almost forgot how good this series really is. And James Marsters? He is the perfect narrator for this book. ...more Took me 5 days to finish this book.

Thanks to Rizwan vai who took out his time to convince me that Dresden files is worth another try after I felt very disappointed reading Storm Front. I skipped Fool Moon as I heard that the story starts kicking at Grave Peril. Well, it was not difficult getting around this without reading fool moon. I have to say, my time paid of brilliantly. I love magic and the magical world, spells, wand, faeries, potions. It has spells. It doesn't have a wand. But it has love potion :P Enough about the book. The best way to find how much good this book is to read it yourself. Now let's talk a little about Mr. Dresden. Dresden is a badass. And I like badass people like Harry Dresden. He is funny and very much human. He never losses his sense of humor, not even in crisis. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe,\u201d Michael said, sotto voce, \u201cthat you came to the Vampires\u2019 Masquerade Ball dressed as a vampire.\u201d \u201cNot just a vampire,\u201d I said, \u201ca cheesy vampire. Do you think they got the point?\u201d He is a wizard, hero of the series but he has his own fears. Fears of losing, dying, loving like a normal being just like any of us. He has flaws just like any people. And it made him so much likable. He felt angry, defeated, tired, lost, terrified. Yet he pushed himself to finish the evil. He is willing to push himself till he die. That\u2019s what make him the hero of this series. I also like Micheal and Bob very much. With the righteousness of Micheal and chatter of Bob, they make the perfect combination with Dresden. \u201cMichael half-smiled. \u201cThe Lord will never give you a burden bigger than your shoulders can bear, Harry. All we can do is face what comes and have faith.\u201d I gave him a sour glance. \u201cI need to get myself some bigger shoulders, then. Someone in accounting must have made a mistake.\u201d \u201cHoly shit,\" I breathed. \"Hellhounds.\" \"Harry,\" Michael said sternly. \"You know I hate it when you swear.\" \"You're right. Sorry. Holy shit,\" I breathed, \"heckhounds.\u201d P.S. I am giving it 4* because I am expecting better books of the series ahead.

There's also intrepid investigative reporter Susan Rodriguez, for whom Harry's feelings are slightly more than professional. There's a \"Hell's Bells\" count: 26 If you're reading this series in sequence (which you absolutely should be, or things will stop making sense very quickly), you've got a good handle on how the world of Harry Dresden operates. He's a lone wolf, so to speak, standing up to the Occult Forces of Chicago with only the support of his contact in the Chicago PD, Lt. Karrin Murphy. There's also intrepid investigative reporter Susan Rodriguez, for whom Harry's feelings are slightly more than professional. There's also the mysterious White Council of Wizards. While you may think that belonging to a worldwide magical fraternity might be a good thing, Harry Dresden would most certainly disagree. To be fair, he has a history - he did kill his mentor using black magic, which is something so bad that it's number one on their list of Things a Wizard Must Not Do, which comes with one free beheading. His associates in the White Council barely tolerate him, and make it very clear that he's worth more to them dead than alive. But more about this in other books.... The point is that Harry so far has been a fairly small-time operator. Yes, he takes down evil sorcerers and vicious werewolves, but mostly on his own. In this book, the camera pulls back a little and we learn more about his world and his connections, and a broader story starts to emerge. The most interesting of these additions is Michael Carpenter, an associate of Harry's whose view of the world comes from a very different place. Michael is a religious man, a committed Christian who sees Harry's use of magic as impure and sullied, but associates with him anyway because they have a shared goal: the elimination of evil. Michael Carpenter is the Fist of God, one of the three Knights of the Cross. As such, he wields a faith powerful enough that even Harry can feel it. Oh, and he also wields a giant sword. With one of the nails from the True Cross worked into it. Amoracchius is a powerful weapon against evil, and a prize that anyone would be glad to have. In this book (as in all his books), Harry is given more trouble than he can handle. It begins with ghosts, as so many things do. The ghosts of Chicago are being stirred up by something - they're acting out in ways they would never act, causing an above-average amount of chaos and disorder in the city. And when there's ghosts around, tearing up the pediatrics ward of your local hospital, who is it you're going to contact telephonically? That's right - Harry Dresden. The ghosts are the least of his worries, however. The force behind them, the malicious entity that is driving the ghosts mad, is of far more concern to him. There's something out there, a Nightmare, that is out for blood. It's attacking Harry and his friends, and doing it through their dreams. Not just Harry's friends who are in good with the supernatural, but some of his Muggle buddies as well. This thing is angry, evil, and can tear a person's soul apart, leaving an empty husk that does nothing but try to scream. As if that weren't enough, the Red Court of Vampires is having a party, and they want Harry to come. Sounds lovely, right? A costume party with the vampires, a promise of protection to all invited guests - how can you have a better night? Myself, I'd start by not hanging around a house full of vampires and their allies. Especially when the hostess, a high-ranking member of the Court, has a serious personal grudge against me. The vampire Bianca wants Harry deader than dead, and she manages to set of a complex series of events to make sure it happens. This book, as I said, expands the Dresden universe a bit. It assumes that the readers are fairly comfortable with what we know, and gives us a lot more to think about. The world-wide spread of vampires, the hide-bound White Council, and the ramifications of having a Faerie Godmother. In the previous books, we saw Harry come out on top against small-scale foes - now the camera pulls back to show us how he goes up against larger institutions. In this book, Dresden is almost always out of his league - although I can't imagine who would be in their league while facing a hoarde of really pissed off vampires while being on the brink of death already. Buffy, probably. Or River Tam. Anyone written by Joss Whedon, I guess. But Dresden makes it through. Not in the \"Finding reserves of strength you never knew were there\" style found in the Whedon Supergirls, but more in the \"This just might be crazy enough to work, unless I kill myself doing it in which case it might not go so well after all\" style. Plus, it has my favorite trope of modern fantasy fiction - even if the hero wins, he doesn't actually save the day. In fact, things get a whole lot worse. Which is all gravy for Jim Butcher, because it means he has all the more material to work with for the rest of the series. ...more You know when you are reading a story and you are thinking, \"There is just NO way the characters can get out of this jam!!

However, I think this was one of the most intense books in the series, and I was totally riveted the entire time. A HUGE factor in my rating was the AWESOME narration by one of my faves, James Marsters . He is one of the few narrators that I love, even though he doesn't do separate voices for each of the characters. He is so emotive, so intense, so perfectly Harry Dresden, that I am spellbound by his performance. Honestly, I don't know if I would like this series as much in ebook or paperback form. There is a magic to it in the audiobook format that I think would be very hard to replicate. Excellent, just excellent. Can't wait for the next. ...more ETA 9/29/11 Re-read: I am moving this up to 5 stars. This is a fantastic book. So many good things.

My only dissatisfaction with this book was that Michael is introduced as a full blown character, whereas it might have been better to have had some of the prior adventures he had with Harry as a separate book before this one. It made me feel like I'd accidentally missed a book in the series with all the plot tie-ins. ...more Oh Wow! I loved this book more than I ever thought I would.

I do get a wee bit tired that every. single. time. there's something going on, Harry is always on his last legs, with the last bit of power, barely able to hold on and figures things out at the last minute and scrapes through his battles in the end. He's always exhausted, weakened, etc. but I can accept that. I can accept that most the characters are also bigger than life/over the top, because it's a fantasy story, and a pretty decent/action packed one, and the characters are fine for that. What I get very tired of, and why I can't rate this book more stars, is Harry talking about every female character as a sex object first. When you first see any character, even long established ones, he has to talk about how a blouse cups a breast or how legs look or how many curves a girl has (and where) or how cute or sexy (or not) a woman is. It's tiring. It's cheap, and it's one of the reasons why I tend to shy away from male writers. Jim Butcher, you're better than that. I appreciate that you've gone as far as making women other than damsels in distress - bravo, but seriously, I hope you lay off the sexualizing of every woman, cheapening them all into sex-objects first, characters later. I can live with once in a while, but I get tired of it every time there's a female on deck. It's demeaning, please stop. Grave Peril has much better pacing (my complaint regarding the second book), and the society and spooks are interesting and pretty complex. This book is fairly dark, and Harry is pretty much a punching bag. The presence of Michael, a character that shows up full blown with no backstory to explain him at first is a little jarring, but Butcher did get around to fleshing out enough of what's going on with Michael that I'm not as thrown off by his larger than life sudden presence as I was at the beginning of the book. It's not a bad book overall, and it could be a great book, but the writing regarding women is starting to leave a bad taste in my mouth. ...more \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (This is a review of the audiobook.)

While he is the resident \u2018anti-hero\u2019 and sleuthing wizard of Chicago, Illinois, he is such a lovable character. Harry is amazing with the big events in the book; however, he really shines in the little moments; such as when he is chagrin in his interaction with his friend Michael Carpenter, a Knight of the Cross, who is the voice of morality with his adherence to Christianity. In the course of ghost hunting with Michael, Harry introduces us so many new characters. One is the faerie Leanansidhe, a Noble of the Winter Court of the Sidhe and Harry\u2019s godmother! Harry is not above telling a lie to get out of a promise he made to her years ago. You can\u2019t blame him, since she\u2019s a bit bipolar and wants to make him one of her hounds, so that she can give him plenty of love and sustenance. There are also many things introduced, such as Amoracchius \u2013 the holy sword wielded by Harry\u2019s friend Michael. You just know this sword is going to be important later on, down the line in this series. A lot happened in this novel; I know I'll be reading or listening to it again. It is loaded not only with ghosts, vampires (White Court, Black Court, or Red Court, take your pick), and faeries (Summer Court and Winter Court fae), but sorceress vampires, duke vampires, vampire promotion balls, sorcerer\u2019s journals, Nightmare-demons, seers who seek Harry out to avoid their own death, priests, policemen, newspaper reporters, Hellhounds, kidnapped pregnant women, cemeteries, dragons, wiped memories and more. Even though Mr. Butcher has created Nevernever out of his fertile imagination, he still manages to bring the \u201cWindy City\u201d alive when I envision this Urban Fantasy world. This is definitely turning into a landmark series. ...more These are definitely getting better. James Marsters\u2019 audio narration has improved noticeably for a start.

Anyway, in this book Butcher manages to keep the plot elements fresh while continuing to develop Harry Dresden as a character. I mean we still have ghosts, demons, vampires etc, but through the story the existing lore we have from the first two books is added to. For instance we find out more about the vampire political structure, and why you should probably avoid being licked by a vampire, though arguably there are worse things a blood sucker could do to you once they\u2019re that close. We also learn a bit more about the Nevernever itself. We meet Harry\u2019s fairy godmother \u2013 not the Cinderella wish granting garden variety fairy godmother \u2013 more like the \u201cmake a deal to sell and enslave your soul\u201d kind. I also liked Harry\u2019s new side kick \u2013 Michael, a Holy Knight of the Cross with his holy sword \u201cAmoracchius.\u201d He talks a lot like Castiel from Supernatural Together they have to figure out what\u2019s got all the ghosts stirred up in the Nevernever. Things get a little dark in this one. Not everyone\u2019s going to come out unscathed and even babies aren\u2019t safe. Things are getting mighty strange... in the neighbourhood...who you gunna call....Well the fairy godmother doesn\u2019t come cheap. Bob\u2019s free though somewhat limited movement wise seeing he only manifests inside a skull. I guess it\u2019s going to be mostly Harry and Michael and a whole lot of hurt. 4 stars ...more Meh . . .

I keep hearing about how awesome this series is, but someone needs to tell me when it gets good! Three books in and I am still not super impressed. The first problem I have is that everything he makes up sounds so convenient and unbelievable. I know that fantasy/supernatural stories involve a lot of made up stuff, but usually the author makes it sound believable. With this book (and the previous ones) whenever the main character is in peril, the author would pull something out of thin air to save the day. (i.e. OMG, the giant monster is going to eat me! But, that monster is from Pittsburgh, and it is Tuesday, and the ancient chronicles say that monsters from Pittsburgh cannot attack wizards on Tuesday. Therefore, with a flick of his wrist, Harry decimated the monster). The second problem is how conveniently every character seems to show up in every scene. Toward the end of the book, they are at a vampire party and every few minutes, the main character runs into someone else from the story. It does end up being relevant to the plot, but it feels forced. The third problem is how whiny Harry Dresden is - I don't know feel like he is believable as a wizard that would take on the forces of evil. Also, because of this, I find it hard to believe that he would attract so many friends and women who want him. He is just kind of blah to me. (and if he says \"Hells bells\" one more time . . . . ) The fourth problem is that the author frequently preaches against the church even though some of the main characters who help him are from the church. He doesn't have to like the church, but it doesn't really seem to advance the story - and, if I were his Christian friends, I would probably leave him in the dust. The fifth problem is that every time a woman walks in the room we get a detailed description of her breasts and nipples. Seems kind of weird; like he doesn't know any other way to describe a woman. Descriptions like this work if used in moderation, but in excess it gets kind of creepy. The sixth problem relates to the audio version of the book. The reader whispers most of the book very slowly, which sometimes made it very hard to hear. Also, it didn't always seem to fit what was happening. Not one of my favorite readings. Despite all of this - a part of me wants to keep going and find out what happens next. I see that this book generally gets good reviews, so I am wondering if maybe this story is just not for me. ...more I really enjoy these books. They are so easy and fun to read, and Harry Dresden is such a compelling and interesting character, I can't wait to read more of his adventures.

He brought a religious faith to the story that, in other hands, or presented through someone other than Harry's perspective, might have been overbearing and annoying. But Michael's faith is a simple thing. It just IS. And I really loved that it made him sure and confident and strong. Quite sexy actually. Rawr. :D Harry was fantabulous in this book. So many of his comments had me giggling. He's just so irreverent. I love it. You just KNOW it has to piss the baddies off when he doesn't take them seriously. But that's what makes Dresden awesome. I also love his conflicted nature... He's a good person because he just IS, but that urge for power is so close to the surface and he struggles against it. It makes him so compelling and identifiable to me, and I love him all the more for it. Definitely looking forward to more of this series.

More impor NB: This review contains spoilers for the FIRST THREE BOOKS of the Dresden Files series. I have now read the first two books of The Dresden Files and started the next in the series, Grave Peril. I am not going any further than this. While I have enjoyed the basic plotlines, Harry Dresden himself is a disappointment to me. I don't want to say that he's a Gary Stu, but at the very least it feels like Jim Butcher identifies with him a little too closely. That always makes me uncomfortable. More importantly, though, I am tired of the way that Harry thinks about women and the way that Butcher writes about them. For one thing, though we're supposed to read Harry's talk about his ideas on chivalry as self-deprecating, it comes across more like, \"Call me old-fashioned, but I am so freakin' noble that it hurts. Apparently it's not PC to treat women well, but...\" Chauvinism thinly disguised as gallantry does not a likeable protagonist make. Additionally, every female character other than Karrin Murphy exists first and foremost to provide sexual interest for Harry, the author, and the audience. It doesn't matter who she is or why she's there--if she's lucky, a woman might get in one or two lines of dialogue before Butcher launches into a lengthy, head-to-toe description of her \"soft hair,\" \"full lips,\" and \"luscious curves\". After that she will never be mentioned again without at least a brief reminder of how totally smokin' hot she is. And every one of these women either loves the male attention or is oblivious to it. What do we have in the first book? Harry's client is a woman. Their first meeting is meant to be a take-off on the film noir convention of the gorgeous dame walking into the private eye's office, but it's played almost totally straight and the client's physical attributes are given a lot of attention even after Harry realizes that she's a distraught mother looking for help to protect her family. The first victim that we see is also a woman and even in the midst of the gory murder scene, Harry can't resist contemplating how beautiful she is. That's right, even female corpses are sex objects first and foremost. The victim's friend and sometime lover is also devastatingly sexy and engages in some come-hither bullshit in the process of passing on information to Harry. One of the villains is a woman and even as Harry finds her creepy and weird, we still have to read about how hot she is. And then there's Harry's eventual girlfriend, Susan. He never stops talking about her body, to the point that it's ridiculous. More on her later. Finally, we meet a woman who is primarily attracted to women but still revels in and actively encourages Harry's male gaze. Most significant, though, is that this is the third female LGBT character that we've met thus far, and the first two are dead prostitutes. This third woman is A) the owner of a brothel, B) evil, and C) not human! She's a vampire, but not of the Bela Lugosi mold: she is actually a horrible, disgusting monster in the skin of a beautiful woman. It's hard for me to believe that the homophobic subtext here is not deliberate. In book two we meet a shape-shifting female character who's incredibly bad-ass--but she spends most of the book completely naked. Although Harry is supposed to be disturbed by this, it doesn't read that way at all, even after he realizes that she isn't human. At one point this woman creates a diversion by dancing naked in the rain, under a streetlight, in front of a couple of male police officers. We also get to see a sometime-student of Harry's. In spite of their working relationship, he still devotes a line or two to informing us that she's gorgeous. The two token female villains amid groups of bad guys are both portrayed as incredibly attractive and seething with barely-restrained lust for the males. Harry acquires a group of sidekicks in this book, a couple of whom are girls. One of them is there solely to provide a love interest for the male leader of the group; the other is the only \"unattractive\" female we have met thus far and it appears that her only purpose is to allow Butcher to make a couple of fat jokes. When Harry has flashbacks of his ex, before we get to the obligatory \"traumatic past\" bit, it's important that we know that she was a slammin' hottie. Susan is also present, but again, I'll get to her in a bit. At the point that I stopped reading book three, a new female client has come into the picture. Not only does Harry talk at length about how beautiful and sexy she is, but she offers him her body in exchange for help. Honestly, each successive book is packed with more straight male wish-fulfillment than the last! Then there's Harry's buddy's wife, a mama-bear stereotype, and although she's pregnant and married to Harry's friend Butcher still makes sure to inform us of how gorgeous and desirable she is. Even when we meet a terrifying supernatural being that's out to get Harry in a bad way, the male gaze fairly oozes from the page. And then Susan comes in and I had to put the book down because it was just too much. I guess I may as well talk about her and Murphy now because I've run out of other women to discuss. Susan, then. I will give Butcher some measure of credit for giving her a career and making her reasonably intelligent. Unfortunately, she still embodies many unfortunate \"hero's girlfriend\" tropes. For starters, much more space is devoted to describing her various physical attributes than to her character development and personality. She is a reporter for an occult publication and was relatively successful before she came into the picture here, but it's not until she starts getting stories from Harry that her work really gets anyone's attention. And while we're supposed to be impressed with her for getting involved in the supernatural action, she's not actually permitted to do anything of interest. In the first book Susan is on a date with Harry when the bad craziness starts. He accidentally gives her a love potion that makes her desperately want to have sex with him at the worst possible time. Then she passes out. Eventually she wakes up and drives away. At the end of the book we learn that she and Harry are going to keep seeing each other. That's it. In book two Susan and Harry are romantically involved. She comes into the story when Harry and the aforementioned nude shape-shifter woman need a ride. Susan's main role in this story is chauffeuring people around and being jealous of the hot, naked woman. Oh, and periodically weeping as Harry acquires more and more injuries over the course of the novel. At one point the whole group goes off to a safehouse for a few hours and Susan heals Harry's wounds with her magical vagina. No, seriously, there's an extended sex scene in which their souls like totally bond or something and she's just so good and beautiful and pure that the power of her love (and her vagina) makes Harry feel all better and ready to stand up and fight. Then Susan drives everyone somewhere else for another epic battle in which she has no involvement whatsoever. When the police come, she drives them all away again. Every once in a while we get a token mention of how she hopes to get an exclusive from Harry for her occult newspaper because apparently her career is now all about him, too. When I left off with the third book, Susan had just come to jail (wearing a \"flirty skirt\" and midriff-baring top) to post bail for Harry and make out with him right then and there. Yup. Harry can't stop thinking about how much he's put her through and how he's just so darned male that he can't bring himself to tell her how he feels, and yet she responds with nothing but pure love, and it's just so moving and beautiful, and on and on to the point that it's nauseating. This probably means that something terrible is going to happen to her sooner or later for the sake of Harry's character development. Finally we have Karrin Murphy, the cop who regularly works with Harry and can't help liking him, although she doesn't entirely trust him. Murphy is a career woman who doesn't seem to have anything going on in her life other than her job. She is short and \"cute\" with a \"punky haircut,\" the only human female who gets to be both physically and mentally tough, and she regularly becomes indignant with Harry for withholding information and for leaving her out of certain things because she's a woman. In fact, in both of the first two novels, she seriously physically assaults him on more than one occasion, but Harry likes and deeply respects her anyway. While Murphy does demonstrate that Butcher is capable of writing complex female characters who serve more of a purpose than keeping the fanboys turned on, it is clear that her prickly exterior is the only thing keeping her from being objectified as literally every other female character has been. We are given to understand that Harry does find her attractive, but that she's too tough for him to get close to, and on a couple of occasions we find him pondering how he wishes he could protect her from all this and he knows chivalry isn't politically correct but blah blah blah. In fact, he does \"protect\" Murphy by refusing to give her any information about the supernatural realm for far longer than is reasonable, given that her job requires her to confront it on almost a daily basis. I keep reading all of these blog posts and reviews that talk about how well Jim Butcher writes. Acquaintances of mine have praised his ability to create compelling female characters that are attractive without being weak and ineffectual, but I just don't see it. Whenever he writes about a woman other than Murphy, no matter what she is doing, her appearance gets more attention and is described in more detail than anything else, to the point that both Harry and the writer come off as kind of slimy. I have given Jim Butcher the full length of two novels and part of a third to get over this, but it has not changed. And frankly, his writing is not skillful or compelling enough for me to stick with the series anyway, so I'm calling it quits. ...more July 2016 : My initial review of this book cracks me up (see below).

Woosh woosh woosh (that was the sound of time passing) oh wait, you love this series now, you bobo. Since I finally fell in love with this series around book ten or so (it was just \"like\" from book four on), I've theorized that if I were ever to revisit the first three books I would feel differently about them, and that turned out to be true. I could see all the pieces being laid for future books, and I was able to place motivations I learned about later and emotions I'd grown to feel for these characters over the more flimsy versions presented here, and it was a richer reading experience as a result. The boredom and disinterest I'd felt the first time through was gone. But I could also see the holes a lot more clearly. This book actually does a lot of groundwork on some core worldbuilding, with the faerie and vampire courts being introduced, the Unseelie Accords, the Knights of the Cross, Harry's godmother, Susan's nascent vampirism, Thomas. A bunch of stuff. Unfortunately two key elements aren't quite working. The first is plot-central. Harry and Michael (a Knight of the Cross, who wields the holy sword Amoracchius) are ghostbusting, and it turns out the rising level of spirit activity and crossover between the real world and the Nevernever is tied to some behind the scenes sorcerer who is out to get revenge on Michael and Harry. (view spoiler) [That sorcerer is Leonid Kravos, who they caught months before, and who committed ritual suicide right before the events of this book so he could become an insanely powerful ghost, thus sidestepping a bunch of restrictions and rules of magic he would have had to abide by had he still been alive. He also teams up with Bianca from the Red Court and Mavra from the Black Court to just royally fuck Harry's shit up. Unfortunately, the execution of this is confusing somewhat. The whole time you're reading, you keep thinking, wait, should I know this story about Kravos? Is this something we've learned before? And when you realize the answer to that is \"no,\" this weird befuddlement sets in. It's a little hard to care about this a-hole when this is the first time we've heard of him. (hide spoiler) ] It's also hard to care about Susan, the woman Harry has been romancing for two years, and around whom the climax of the novel is centered. The narrative moves super fast, so it's easy to get distracted and not figure out why Susan is not a good character (and perhaps this is what happened to Butcher--which is understandable, only his third novel, he doesn't know how to translate the character in his head to the page quite yet). But when you stop and think about her, we know NOTHING except that she's a journalist, and that she's beautiful. It would be generous to say that she's tenacious, but her attempts to gain story information out of Harry, or her foolhardy actions in this book that put everyone in danger, just look foolish without any context. We never hear about her unless she's fighting with or fucking Harry. (\"Describe Susan as a character.\" \"She's got some nice shapely limbs?\") And so when she insists on attending the vampire party, we only see Harry's POV, that she is putting herself in needless danger and doesn't understand what she's getting into. And worse, we don't care when she's injured and captured and turned into an almost vampire. She's an empty, beautiful, annoying shell. (view spoiler) [That the pivotal moment of the book is Harry confessing his love to her is kind of a joke. What is there to love about her? Harry must see it, but I sure can't. (hide spoiler) ] I can't wait to keep going in this re-read, when all the characters we've met actually get development, and the worldbuilding deepens and everything gets awesome. Raising up my rating half a star, though, because aside from those two main complaints, I really did enjoy it so much more this time around. [3.5 stars] September 2009 : Final verdict on this series: Not my cup of tea, but I can see how others might enjoy it.
