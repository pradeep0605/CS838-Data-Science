Plus Odd trying to explain that he's not crazy. It was an easy listen, plus David Erin Baker narrated it perfectly. I really liked the way he did it. It felt natural. Even the way he portrayed the characters was amazing. He was consistent. I now take back my statement of how I hated audiobooks. I realized that if the right person narrates it,<---M> then it would turn out good</---M>, for me. I'll never prefer audiobooks over text, but at least I'm starting to appreciate it a lot. Thanks a lot, David Erin Baker. Will surely listen to his other audiobooks. 3/5 stars. I will be finishing this series, no matter how pointless it gets. I already care enough to know how Odd's life will turn out. I just hope that the next one would be better than this. ...more I love <---C>Odd Thomas</---C>. I think he is a great character: endearing, quirky, funny. All the qualities I would want in a good friend. And of course, his ability to see ghosts, and his fundamental compassion towards those spirits, makes him special and even more admirable. So I was fully expecting to love this book, as I did the first two in this series (<---B>Odd Thomas and Forever Odd</---B>). Unfortunately, ***SPOILER ALERT**** the climax of this book was very disappointing. It lasted approximately 1 and 1/2 pages o I love Odd Thomas. I think he is a great character: endearing, quirky, funny. All the qualities I would want in a good friend.

So I was fully expecting to love this book, as I did the first two in this series (Odd Thomas and Forever Odd). Unfortunately, ***SPOILER ALERT**** the climax of this book was very disappointing. It lasted approximately 1 and 1/2 pages out of the 430 pages of the book. It was over so quickly as to be anti-climatic. There was a huge buildup fortifying the monastery against the evil forces, bringing together the Brothers and all their make-shift weapons, protecting the children at all costs, and then, bang. One shot and its all over. It was way to simple and quick of an ending for me. And the actual ending of the book, with Odd getting out of the car and walking away with his ghost dog (too cliche for me) and Elvis, I thought <---A>Dean Koontz</---A> was making a mockery of Odd, reducing him from a full, three dimensional character whom I felt deeply for to a puppet, stringing him and me along for more books, more money, more more for Mr. Koontz. This book was great, or more to the point, exactly what I was expecting and enjoyed and wanted to read, until chapter 48, or page 370. Then the last 60 pages of the book disappointed me and made me feel slighted and manipulated by Mr. Koontz. ...more This is the fourth time I've actually read <+++>Brother Odd</+++>.

Some passages: Humanity is a parade of fools, and I am at the front of it, twirling a baton. ______ In this world where too many are willing to see only the light that is visible, never the Light Invisible, we have a daily darkness that is night, and we encounter another darkness from time to time that is death, the deaths of those we love, but the third and most constant darkness that is with us every day, at all hours of every day, is the darkness of the mind, the pettiness and meanness and hatred, which we have invited into ourselves, and which we pay out with generous interest. ______ \"Quantum theory gives us reason to believe that on a deep structural level, every point in the universe is in some ineffable way the same point.....The interconnectedness of every point in the universe is so complete that if an enormous flock of birds bursts into flight from a marsh in Spain, the disturbance of the air caused by their wings will contribute to weather changes in Los Angeles.\" ______ \"Mr. Thomas, any scientist will tell you that in nature many systems appear to be chaotic, but when you study them long enough, strange order always underlies the appearance of

I loved his integrity, his dry humor and his bravery. I recall reading a quote, something along the lines that bravery isn't the absence of fear, it's the presence of fear but the willingness to do what is needed, anyway. That describes Odd Thomas to a T. B A D B O O K ! Koont'z purple prose give me a migraine and makes me want to kill. This book will give your pets cholera.

They were all witty, all the time. And Brother Knuckles was an annoying stereotype of a former mobster. That said, the completely and totally over-the-top story was pretty intriguing, and the imagery was awesome. And Koontz's writing is good--simple and straightforward, but overall pretty good. I just couldn't suspend my disbelief much here: the characters' annoying traits kept pulling me out of it. ...more When I'm working hard on cleaning, organizing, repairing, or any of the mundane chores of life, I like to listen to audio books.

I thought the end came a bit too easily, but there was a lot of genuine tension throughout the book and some very nice description to go along with interesting characters. It's been a while since I've read the Odd Thomas series, I had to go back and refresh my memory a little bit before jumping into this book, and I'm glad I did. Brother Odd was an entertaining and fun read, had some comedy in it, some parts making me laugh out loud. It did however take a bit to figure out the plot, and what's going on. But as I read more, it started making sense. No matter how weird or strange his books can be, I gotta say Dean Koontz is a phenomenal writer! Brother Odd is Dean Koontz's redemption piece after the fiasco that was Forever Odd, whether or not the author thinks so is beside the point. He redeemed himself in my eyes. Everything I hated from the second book is thankfully absent from the third, while everything I adored about the first book returns in abundance. Odd doesn't have to spend 120 pages walking this time around because he's already at the site of the book's action. I have read other reviews that complain about the story line bei Brother Odd is Dean Koontz's redemption piece after the fiasco that was Forever Odd, whether or not the author thinks so is beside the point. He redeemed himself in my eyes. Everything I hated from the second book is thankfully absent from the third, while everything I adored about the first book returns in abundance. Odd doesn't have to spend 120 pages walking this time around because he's already at the site of the book's action. I have read other reviews that complain about the story line being too far-fetched, but when going into a read about a dude that sees dead people and hangs with Elvis's ghost, I tend to expect outlandish plots and ideas. I refuse to spoil anything this time around because there is much to be given away. While reading Brother Odd I came to understand why I loathed Forever Odd so much. In Forever Odd, there is almost no character interaction, and what little there is concerns characters I couldn't care less about. In Brother Odd, there's an abundance of quirky characters you can grow to love and worry about. Each one is unique. Most do not even require dialogue tags because Dean fleshes out their tones and deliveries so well. That's what I loved about the first book, the characters. In Forever Odd there are a total of five characters throughout 99% of the book. The villain and her two henchmen, a disabled friend of Odd's so forgettable Dean didn't bother mentioning him in book one or book three, and Odd, himself. The most remarkable quality of this book, though, is the humor. I received many a strange look from my wife during spontaneous outbursts of laughter. I remember Odd Thomas being laugh-out-loud-funny, and Brother Odd returns to the sarcastic, witty tone of the original. I think I laughed twice throughout the second book, and I'm pretty sure I wasn't supposed to laugh where I did. Read Odd Thomas, skip Forever Odd, and pick up Brother Odd. Trust me, you aren't missing much if you overlook book two.I have no idea what purpose Forever Odd has in the world of Odd Thomas. Though Dean goes into great detail about the happenings of the first book inside the pages of Brother Odd, there is but one mention in one tiny paragraph concerning the happenings of the second book.

Also, I love Odd, but the Stormy talk was getting a bit depressing. I love that he loved her that much, but I really hope he moves on and doesn't talk about her as much in the next book. Still, I overall enjoyed the story and laughed out loud at a few parts. The characters were great and there interactions entertaining. I look forward to reading the next book and seeing where Odd's journey takes him. ...more The third instalment of Odd and it seems that Koontz is running out of ideas which is a shame as there is a fourth one on the way.

And Koontz delivered with warmth and homeyness even as violence broke out. It's an odd mixture of science and the metaphysical, not at all what I would expect. But then, neither is Odd. The peace and vitality with which Koontz invested the monastery and the brothers was very appealing as well as their purpose in aiding the children. A contrast made greater when the bodachs and then the bone man appears. It's creepy how Koontz can---in one sentence---provide warmth and then snatch it away. And yet greater when Koontz points out that medical science has progressed to a point where it's rare for children damaged by \"chromosomal abnormalities\". Instead, it's parents who don't want to give up their drugs long enough to deliver a healthy child, adults who think nothing of brutally beating a child. As Odd puts it: Hell must be going through a construction boom these days. Okay, I know that the police chief and Father Llewellyn vouched for Odd, but I really can't imagine anyone simply accepting the weird statements Odd makes about the monastery needing to \"fortify and defend\". No, it's absolutely great that they do, but really, why?? Then there's that whole relationship with Romanovich and his interaction with Odd. It's odd, it's weird, it's as though Koontz slipped it in simply to ensure laughter. The Story Events in Odd Thomas , 1, and Forever Odd , 2, and the sixteen months since Stormy's death have left Odd unbalanced, and he makes a deal with God to allow him to retreat from the world. But it seems that God has his own agenda in mind for Brother Odd, and it's the bodachs who awaken Odd to potential trouble, followed by the body in the courtyard. Life and Death stalk St. Bart's. The Characters Odd Thomas is a brilliant fry cook who happens to see dead people and feels compelled to help them find justice. Boo is a white shepherd-mix Odd encounters at the monastery. Bronwen Llewellyn, a.k.a., Stormy , was Odd's girlfriend. St. Bartholomew's Abbey is both monastery and home for disabled children who include Annamarie , ten and trapped in a wheelchair; Justine is partially paralyzed and does not speak (another reason for licensing parents); Walter can play note-perfect any music he hears, but can't speak or care for himself; Jacob Calvino is a beautiful artist, able to draw the emotions people feel, and he's terrified of the Neverwas; and, Flossie Bodenblatt wants to be known as Christmas instead. Sister Angela , the mother superior, and Father Bernard , the abbot, are the only ones who know of Odd's gift. Brother Knuckles , the former Salvatore Giancomo, was a mobster before he saw the light. Brother Timothy takes care of the mechanical systems for the abbey and school. Father Reinhart is the prior. Brother John was once known as John Heineman, a \"brilliant physicist...but increasingly a tortured soul\". He used his brilliance to amass billions and then retreated. Brother Roland is the guestmaster. Brother Gregory is the infirmarian and helps Brother Norbert with laundry. B rother Leopold is one of the few that Odd doesn't like. Brother Fletcher is the cantor and music director. Brother Quentin was a policeman in his previous life, and he and Brothers Quentin , Alfonse , Augustine , Kevin , Maxwell , and Rupert will be the monastery's defenders. If they can just get them all in one place. Sister Marie Claire and Sister Miriam , a social worker before she entered Holy Orders, are two of the sisters with St. Barts. Brother Constantine is a dead monk who committed suicide and haunts the bell tower. A Reaper haunts the bell tower and the monastery. Rodion Romanovich is the glowering Russian currently staying in the guesthouse, who claims to be a librarian from Indiana. Chief Wyatt Porter , the chief of police in Pico Mundo, California, Odd's hometown, and Father Sean Llewellyn , Stormy\u2019s uncle, keep Odd's secrets and vouche for him. P. Oswald \"Little Ozzie\" Boone is his hugely fat friend and mentor who wallows in good food as he writes several series of books about detectives. Elvis ' ghost hangs with Odd; Odd reckons he hopes \"find the courage to move on\". The NSA shows up spouting phrases like \"rot in prison\". Bodachs are supernatural entities which can enter any building, any space and gather wherever \"violent or fiery catastrophe is destined to erupt\" for \"they feed on human suffering\". The greater the number of bodachs, the greater the slaughter. Just don't let them even think you know they exist. The Cover and Title The cover is an interesting blend of the magically metaphysical and religion with its rainbow of yellow-orange-red-violet of stormy cloud effects slanting diagonally across the face of the cover and a brown hooded monk with rope belt. The title succinctly indicates the who and the where, for it's Brother Odd in a monastery. ...more Having reread Brother Odd, I've decided that I enjoyed this volume more than the first book in the series. In addition to Odd's continuous wit, there's a group of badass monks and nuns who help defend a school of vulnerable children against evil creatury-things that are going to kill them--and if that isn't awesome, then I don't know what is. As I've been rereading this series, I've fallen into long bouts of introspection in which I ponder the human condition much as Odd himself does.

As I've been rereading this series, I've fallen into long bouts of introspection in which I ponder the human condition much as Odd himself does. Odd is always on the lookout for other people and never does anything for his own pleasure. He helps lingering spirits move on to heaven. He thwarts evil by placing his life at risk to save others. It comes as no surprise to me that the final volume of this series is going to be called Saint Odd. Just as the actual saints who populate history gave of themselves to better mankind, Odd Thomas is one of the most selfless characters that I have ever encountered in fiction. And it's a shame--because so many people are not selfless at all. Yes, there are truly good people and I am thankful for them. But every act of violence seen in the world stems from one basic cause: selfishness. There will never be peace until every human soul turns away from selfishness and places the well-being of others over their own desires. I guess I'll step down from my soapbox now before I've written a novel-length review about the perils of greed and sin and how human arrogance leads to suffering. Maybe I'll write a blog post about it or something. (P.S. Why do they call it a soapbox, anyway? If I stood on the little cardboard boxes that my soap comes in, they would just get squashed flat under my shoes.) ...more I love Dean Koontz. I love Odd Thomas. In fact, I love that Dean Koontz loves Odd Thomas enough to write a third (and I'm guessing, soon a fourth) book about him. So I may be a little biased in saying that BROTHER ODD is one of my favorite books of the year. Odd has left Pico Mundo to join the nuns and brothers in a monastery. Although he's not taking his vows, he's been enjoying the peace and quiet--and relative safety--that being with these brothers and sisters of Christ has brought. He's also I love Dean Koontz.

Although he's not taking his vows, he's been enjoying the peace and quiet--and relative safety--that being with these brothers and sisters of Christ has brought. He's also enjoyed the numerous children who live there, those who are physically or mentally handicapped, abandoned by their parents, sometimes even suffering at their hands. Then, as always seems to be the case with Odd, the bodachs show up, and he knows that something bad has come to the monastery. But does it come from the novices, the brooding Russian, the brother who was once muscle for the Mob, the brother who is also a brilliant scientist, or from someone else entirely? With his faithful dead sidekick, Elvis, and his faithful friends, and the sometimes strange memory and even stranger \"spirit\" of Stormy, Odd must work to keep the entire population of his new home safe from whatever danger lurks ever nearer. This is another winner from Mr. Koontz, and the ending, of course, leaves it open for another book about the wonderful, amazing, flawed, and utterly lovable Odd Thomas. Well worth picking up, BROTHER ODD will have you reading long into the night. ...more 4-4.5 stars This was a really good addition to the Odd Thomas series.

The basic conclusion at the end of the book was that trying to use science to better understand God was not only flawed, but blasphemous. Although I myself am an atheist, as someone with a science background who was raised Roman Catholic and still have many friends who do believe in God from many different faiths, I confess to disagree. I suppose if it has been clearer that that was only Odd's distinct interpretation of events rather than the obvious conclusion, I wouldn't have been bothered so much. In sort of the same vein, there was also a full page where Odd muses about the evils of those who are cruel to disabled children, which I started out agreeing with, until he also threw in people who aborted unborn, disabled fetuses. I guess it depends on your view of abortion, really, but I wouldn't myself lump a woman who aborted a child with Down's in with someone who sodomized and attempted to kill a seven-year-old after killing her whole family as equally evil and deserving of eternal torment and damnation, but that's me. The plot was also more hokey and weird. Instead of our normal killer, it's a mad scientest-monk who has created sentient machine-esque creatures made of incomprehensibly complex workings of moving bone to exterminate mostly disabled terminally ill children because he was angry that he once had a kid that was disabled.

This entire plot is great but what you want to know is if the book is good, right? You came to the right place to find out. This is my review of Brother Odd the third part of the Odd Thomas book series. It brings in a whole new cast of very memorable characters. You feel for them, you want them to be safe and live. Plus two of them reoccur in the sequel. There are three returning characters. Of course one is Odd himself and because I didn\u2019t mention the other two in my previous two reviews, I am not going to name them. The plot is really great all the way through filled with twists and turns you won\u2019t see coming at you. It can be disturbing at times but that adds to the new creepier atmosphere and new villain. The plot will also keep you guessing about who the real villain is. This book is awesome all the way around. It has the perfect mix of jokes, suspense, creepiness and twists that will keep you entertained the whole way through. I highly recommend it to anyone. ...more So far, this is the best book in the series for the creepiness factor alone.

The bone creatures that are staulking the children are creepy as hell. It truly creeped me out to hear about these critters scuttling around and murdering people from the inside out. Yuk! I have visions of my best friend from childhood when I think of Odd Thomas. He is very intelligent and quick-witted and will say or do anything to make someone smile. It's a rather endearing trait. Odd's adventures are, well odd but typical prose for Dean Koontz.

The humor in the book again very well balanced with a 'tense-ish' story line to maintain the balance just well enough that the reading experience is pure joy and the reader simply has to know what happens next. A very good recovery was made from creating the idea that the enemy in this story is just too fanciful to be believed, even for the folks that do believe in ghosts, but everything was brought into perspective at exactly the right time. My disappointment at the end of the book due to a 'loss' and a 'new found' friend did not tickle my fancy though, so looking forward to see how this plays out in the next novel. ...more At this point in the series, Odd is kind of like Caine from Kung Fu.
