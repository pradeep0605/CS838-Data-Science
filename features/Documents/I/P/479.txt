Boring Bill announces he is leaving for Peru and Eric, the 6\u20194\u201d Viking, makes an appearance in Bon Temps under a set of highly unusual circumstances: he is running down the side of the road half naked and he has amnesia. Now honestly, don\u2019t you think more books should start with a half naked vampire who has amnesia? If that doesn\u2019t appeal to you, well, to be perfectly honest, you and I might have a hard time finding something to laugh about together because that tickles my funny bone on so many levels; I can\u2019t even begin to explain. There are several things going through my head right now in regards to this book: --Eric with amnesia is hot. --I\u2019m not thrilled with the inconsistencies that continually crop up, but I find myself willingly forgiving them because I\u2019m having so much fun with the story. One example that stood out in this book was a description of shirtless Eric where he didn\u2019t have chest hair. But a later description is about what his chest hair looks like when it\u2019s covered in blood. Hm. --I\u2019m glad Harris finally explained how Bubba is able to enter private residences even if he hasn\u2019t been extended an invitation. I\u2019d been wondering about that ever since the end of the previous book.<---F> --Jason, Jason, Jason</---F>. What\u2019s going to happen to you, Jason? I\u2019ve felt indifferent to Jason for most of the series thus far, but in this one it hit me that he reminds me of someone I knew years ago. My then-boyfriend had a goofy friend who fit Jason\u2019s description to a T in personality, appearance, you name it. That made me laugh. --As for Sookie herself, she continues to get more interesting with each book. She\u2019s likeable and funny and appealing because she feels like a real person. It\u2019s typical in this genre for humans who spend a lot of time hanging around vampires, werewolves and other supernatural creatures to become something more human than human. But not Sookie. At this point, the only thing she has to protect herself against the big bads of the supernatural world are her telepathic abilities and the fact that she can wield a mean shotgun (which is kind of hot in a lesbie friend kind of way). The only thing I would change about Sookie is to advise her to lose the word of a day calendars. They\u2019re silly. ...more Loving eric and sookie's chemistry!

I mean seriously - DUH when it came to that question. I was bummed that it felt like Harris had thrown in the towel and just continued to milk that cash cow for all it was worth. I don\u2019t fault any author for being done with a character or a series, but I do fault them for continuing on/signing new contracts/cashing paychecks when their heart isn\u2019t in it any longer. As much as fans might bitch and moan about wanting moremoremore, it\u2019s even worse when we get said moremoremore but find out we spent our hard earned moolah on crap. Now, I\u2019m not saying this series started off with goooooood books. Obviously they weren\u2019t ever up for a National Book Award. Buuuuuuuuuut, this re-read reminded me why I got so addicted to all the fluffy yumminess . . . Mmmmmm, Eric. OVIOUSLY ! The early books in this series had more than just hot vampires and bangable werewolves . . . (view spoiler) [ (hide spoiler) ] going for them, though. They also had a PLOT . Better than that even - MULTIPLE plotlines and tons of action \u2013 both in and out of the sack. In <+++>Dead to the World</+++> we\u2019re introduced to a weird little place called Hotshot, a glamazon known as Claudine, a missing brother, crossing storylines between witches and werewolves and shifters (OH MY), a cameo by Bubba . . . and last but most DEFINITELY not least, amnesiac Eric . . . You are all familiar with Eric, right???? Wait. Where was I??? Oh yeah, Eric . . . . If only he\u2019d done some more of this . . . along with the making of the sex. <+++>Dead to the World</+++> was pure guilty pleasure that loses a star because in real life if your MOTHERF*&^ING RAPIST goes away to Peru you throw a G.D. party instead of pining for him. Get your f-ing head checked, Sookie. And also, because having all of the sexytimes interrupted by Eric calling the Queen of the Dipshits his \u201clover\u201d which almost caused me to lose my sploosh. Worst. Pet. Name. Ever. Seriously. Here\u2019s Exhibit A for proof: Many thanks to Stepheny for letting me tag along on this re-read and to Karly for hopping in as well. You gals know how to bring the Eric giffy goods ; ) I\u2019d say I\u2019m going to leave well enough alone and not read any more of this series, but I\u2019ve learned to never say never. Plus, I might get the urge to read about ol\u2019 Bob again . . . For now, though, I\u2019ll simply say . . .

This had everything I love about Sookie and her world. Practically no Bill, lots of Eric (the hot Viking Sheriff of District Five), Weres, Witches, death, destruction, sex and tons of telepathic Sookie fun. Did I say sex? Well, you hit the perfect balance between sex and action in this book, and I actually found some of the sex between Sookie and Eric to be arousing (not something I can say for your scenes between Sookie and Bill). And while I am on the subject of Vampire sex, Charlaine, thanks for eschewing the angsty, glittery, chaste, annoying Vampirism of Ms. Meyers. You celebrate Vampire naughtiness, then throw in some shape changing naughtiness for good measure, and that's so much more fun to read than the moody, whiny love triangle between a vapid girl, a pissy wolfboy and creepy \"vegan\" vamp. So thanks for creating your bizarre, but believable world of everyday Supes who're challenging our prejudices by revealing that they've always been among us. Thanks for True Blood (both the fictional product and the HBO series), fangbangers (the coolest fictional term I've ever read in a pulpy novel), Fangtasia and the whole wacky population of Bon Temps. I know your books are trashy, and I know some of them have pissed me off in the past, but Dead to the World is an exceptional piece of B-Lit trash. I am now a fan now matter how bad the rest of the books are. Sookie Stackhouse = Fun. I don't need anything more than that. So thanks one last time, <---A>Charlaine Harris</---A>. I love your kooky mind. Yours, Brad Simkulet ...more Dead to the World is the fourth installment in the Sookie Stackhouse series. I actually read this a year or more back but re-read it last night again and realized I like it more than 4 stars. Eric is my favorite character to start with, but during this book I love the new Eric also. He seemed so venerable and lost. It was Eric from a simpler time, without all the death and pain. He was reborn and cute as hell. lol! And I think Eric truly felt something for Sookie. What could have been! But, then Dead to the World is the fourth installment in the Sookie Stackhouse series.

He was reborn and cute as hell. lol! And I think Eric truly felt something for Sookie. What could have been! But, then Eric wouldn't be the Eric that we've come to love. And I do like the original Eric a lot. As for the story line outside of Sookies romance life, Sookie doesn't have it easy. Her brother goes missing, she's being hated to the point where the answer comes to death and to save Eric from losing his memory permanently, she has to go up against very powerful witches, that ends up in a battle for lives. Dead to the World was very exciting and suspenseful read. The romance was great and the plot was well put together. I really enjoyed this book. I'm not looking forward to Dead in the Family(due out in May?) If you haven't read this series yet, or have only watched the show, I highly recommend you read the books. The show may be good but the books are great. You don't know what your missing! ...more I'm not going to lie- I'm feeling disappointed. I have continuously heard that this is the \"Eric book.\" From everyone who has EVER read these books. \"Wait until you get to book 4!!\" Who's Eric? you ask. Let me show you: He's a beautiful Viking vampire. He is sex on a stick. He will turn any woman's legs to jello...and well... other parts of her will be doing other things.

Oh and were-panthers Yeah. I know. So, while the few instances of sexy time with Eric were great I was overall disappointed. And even more disappointed that with a $50,000.00 paycheck Sookie couldn't even give him the benefit of letting know he finally got to tap that ass. Talk about a snob! If I got Eric in the sack- you can guarantee everyone with ears would know about it. And then I'd use the 50 grand to pay for a national advertisement. But hey, I guess that's me.

I will merely say I find her moronic and tedious, for purposes of this review. After reading this, the fourth book in the series, I think I have figured out what it is exactly that I cannot stand about Harris\u2019s writing style. I am a person who views language as an art form. I believe that while there are several words that may be substituted in the place of each other that there is generally one word which flows best. I believe that words have a reactive feeling within us and that (although English is certainly not the most elegant of the languages) a writer has a responsibility to their readers to attempt to make that language resonate in their stories. To choose words which do not smash and jar the reader in opposition to the emotions you are trying to invoke in a particular scene. (Of course, like almost anything, there are exceptions to this.) I really don\u2019t think Harris would agree with me. In my opinion, she sacrifices much in way of style and language art for substance in this series. And, to me, it shows. There are many choices she makes, language-wise, that simply do not jive with me. Let me make an example: The *bleh* mouthfeel (a word I find in contradiction to the very thing it\u2019s expressing) of the word \u2018Love\u2019 is like a circle, perfectly rotating; it is a soft word that feels balanced on the tongue. Love . If love were a letter it would be an \u201cO\u201d. The word \u201cLover\u201d, on the other hand, is like a \u201cQ\u201d, a circle with a stop in it; that feels jarring to my mouth (and also when my brain speaks it when reading). I abhor the term \u201cLover\u201d (and \u201cBaby\u201d, for that matter). Both of these endearments are overused in this story. I have much more positive feelings about the show based on this series than I do the book series it is based on, and as a reader that upsets me. It\u2019s no well-hidden secret that I have fond feelings for \u2018Eric Northman\u2019. Dead to the World begins with Eric having amnesia and behaving very docile and un-Eric-like. And while I adore the smart-mouthed asshole persona, I admit to having a soft spot for memory-washed Eric. He makes me wonder what Eric, the human Viking, must have been like. There are several different stories happening simultaneously in this book. Jason, Sookie\u2019s lady-killer brother, goes missing; Sookie is put on Eric-Watch and a group of evil witches is trying to take over Shevreport. For a book with so much potential plot there is far too much uninteresting bullshit within these pages. As I said, there is a lot of meat to this story (and I\u2019m curious how it would have read if I hadn\u2019t known what was likely to happen going in) but Harris concentrated far too much on the fat. Had this been trimmed down I believe it would have been more interesting, if not more artistically pleasing to me. Also, that cover is not pleasant AT ALL. That image of Eric almost killed all sploosh-factor a couple times. One final note (as my review is now reaching lengthy proportions): I loathed the amount of Bill-thought/talk within this book. For one, Bill was not present. For second, at the end of the last book Bill raped Sookie. The fact that this incident is glossed over in a way that minimises the act is DEEPLY unsettling to me. ...more It's Bloodsucker's Month with my lovely MacHalo beasties , so I'm going for a re-read of my favorite Sookie book.

Plus, my eyes glaze over every time she is in Merlotte's with Sam. However, that first sex scene between Eric and Sookie never gets old. Still sizzles, in my view! (Even though Charlaine Harris calls Sookie's boobs puppies, as in \"they shivered like puppies wanting to be petted,\" which is pretty cheesy). There was also a reference to Eric \"learning her topography.\" LOL But, still, that's the kind of scene you want to read over and over. Dang, Eric Northman is hot. I don't know if I'll be re-reading any more of these any time soon. It reminds me too much of how horribly the series ended and how bad the books started getting. Sad.

The good aspects? Harris continues her pretty accurate portrayal of small town life in North America (minus the vampires & werewolves, at least in my home town). It can be petty and gossipy, but when bad things happen, people come together to do something about them. Sookie becomes a free agent (Bill the Boring has been sent to Peru) and, because of who & what she is (a telepath), Sookie becomes the focus of a fair amount of supernatural male attention. After being ignored & scorned by regular guys for years, Sookie is starting to enjoy being the centre of attention for a change. Another plus is that Sookie does not get beaten up in this episode and she starts to think about keeping herself safe, instead of leaving it up to the man in her life. I like her determination to belong to herself, not to any man of any stripe and to be capable of whatever she needs to be capable of. Negatives? Well, Eric doesn\u2019t remember the days that he has spent with Sookie once the curse is lifted from him, so they are back to square one. Amnesiac Eric is a much different guy than the regular Eric, confused and dependent. (And he unfortunately becomes a lot like Boring Bill). I need more background info on Eric\u2014what was he like way back when he was human? How did he get to be the smart-mouthed Lothario that he currently is (when he\u2019s not cursed)? Although the vampires are quite well realized and have a logical framework to behave within, Harris just seems to throw in other beings with very little thought. The portrayals of witches and Wicca are down-right insulting, and she throws in a Maenad, shape-changers and fairies casually, just because she can. This series is fluff & sugar, not great literature, but each volume represents an entertaining evening. Despite the drawbacks, I\u2019m still enjoying the series and will definitely request the next book from the library sooner rather than later. ...more With Bill off to Peru, one night Sookie finds cocky, authoritative, smug Eric running almost naked down her road, his memory gone and his personality changed along with it.

It's one hellish start to the year for Sookie, and this new, caring, considerate Eric is just too hard to resist... Great fun, solid mystery and no glaring holes, that I noticed anyway. I was disappointed Eric doesn't remember anything that happened while he was cursed, because I'm really starting to feel sorry for Sookie and I'm glad she hasn't forgiven Bill yet - he's very distant and hasn't even made an effort to mend things. One thing that still bugs me: Chow can't have been in the yakuza, because the yakuza is Japanese and Chow is not a Japanese name. It seems more like a handy Asian cliche and that's pretty disappointing. ...more I'm not sure why I didn't like this one as much as I thought I would.

And once I got past the pages of repetitive back story I was quite excited about the prospects. Unfortunately though as much as I enjoy and admire her writing I was never able to get fully engaged in this story. It could be because of the addition of even more fantastical creatures, I mean I could have done without the were-panthers theme and the coven of witches, oh and how could I forget the good fairy but hey that\u2019s just me and my aversion to UF speaking. On the plus side the \u201cnew\u201d Eric was delicious on every level though it does make me wonder what Harris has against Bill. Its not that I \u2018m a team Eric, team Bill type girl but why bother to introduce him as Sookie\u2019s love just to keep sending him away every book, its just weird to me and doesn\u2019t even allow for a good love triangle to develop. The thing is this series is almost awesome, the writing is amazing, the world building, the action and horror aspects, the relatable, fascinating and sexy characters but I just don\u2019t always understand Harris\u2019s choices. A few more love scenes wouldn\u2019t go astray either, although the one that we do get here is extra steamy.

Its New Years eve when we first join Sookie again, she\u2019s driving home from a busy night at Merlottes. Bill has up and left for Peru and the last thing she needs or expects to see right now is a half naked vampire running down the road. Things get even more interesting when the vamp turns out to be Eric who for some reason can\u2019t seem to remember anything. This new kinder, gentler Eric has no clue who he is much less what\u2019s happened to him in fact he even seems a little scared. Sookie being well Sookie takes him home of course. I mean what girl could refuse a half dressed, nervous blond Viking vampire It soon becomes apparent that whoever took Eric\u2019s memory also wants him dead and through a series of events Sookie gets put in charge of keeping him alive. Meanwhile her brother has gone missing and a battle is brewing (ha) between a coven of witches and the local werewolf/ shifter population. Sam, Alcide, Bubba, Chow and Pam all make appearances along with a whole new cast of interesting characters. Now all Sookie has to do is find her brother, keep Eric alive, avoid the witches, dispose of the bodies, and hold onto her heart because this new version of Eric is very hard to resist.

This is always a good thing. Yes, it must be said that sometimes the stories are too similar to one another and after being on a marathon of these (and will continue until book 7... I've bought them all at discount at Target!...) I sometimes forget what has occurred before and when. But I do love reading about Sam the shapeshifter, Bill, who leaves the plot for larger portions later on, and the clueless but lovable Sookie who tries to live as normal a life as possible, while the Children of the Night are drawn to her irresistibly. As are we. ...more Jan, 2009: Somewhat to my surprise, this book was every bit as good or a bit better than the previous ones. Very enjoyable, quick read which for me to say about a 4th novel in a series is somewhat unusual. I generally tire of series as repetition takes its toll. Not in this case. Some new oddities are introduced in a good, logical manner, opening the world up & adding a bit more depth. Sookie's character develops more & our time line of events is confirmed.

This book takes place about a year after Sookie first meets Bill & I found it helpful that she reflects a bit on this. It tied the series tighter for me.

Why? you ask.... Sookie, you lucky dog, you! Yes! Finally Sookie realizes that Eric is much better than Bill the Bore!

Eric is not our normal Eric - he's amnesia Eric because a witch cursed him. So he's sweet, vulnerable, and open. Now, that makes Sookie like him more, and I admit that he's a sweetie pie. But, for me, personally, I like normal Eric. He has more bite (pun intended). He's sarcastic, hilarious, arrogant, and deadly. The perfect book-boyfriend! I don't want too much sweet in my book boyfriends. They need to be witty and have a little bit of a narcissistic personality disorder to be interesting to me. Yeah, I know how to pick 'em. yeah, I'm going to be including a lot of Eric gifs in all my reviews. It just makes me happy. SorryNotSorry So, Sookie is taking care of Eric while these witches are out to find him and are trying to take over all of the vampire and were ventures. They really know how to live up to their name bitches witches. That's just disturbing, Grandma. Did you forget to take your pills again? Also, Sookie's brother, Jason is missing and there is evidence of foul play. I like Jason, and think he would be a great character to focus on later, so I was really hoping he would survive the book. Please don't push that button, Charlaine Harris! Let him live to f*ck another day... Another character that is really coming to life in these books is Pam, Eric's number 2. She is funny without meaning to be - which is my favorite kind of funny. She's a super deadly and blood-thirsty bi-sexual vampire who looks like a soccer-mom, and is becoming Sookie's most unlikely friend. I want to be her friend! I need more crazy friends who are as bloodthirsty as I am (at least in the bookish sense). I hope that she gets a lot more play in the future books. Overall, there is a lot of fun in this book, along with the romance between Sookie and Eric that I was hoping for, but I wish it could have ended differently. I want a romance between Sookie and the real Eric! The Eric that laid on top of her to take a bullet for her in the vampire house shooting, who dressed up and pretended to be flamboyantly gay for her, who was proud of her for killing Lorena, and who punched a guy in the face for saying a crude remark to Sookie, saying: \"You are speaking of my future lover. Be more respectful.\" As Sookie describes him: He had never viewed Eric with any sense of humor, as I did. I'd always been leery of Eric, but I'd appreciated his mischief, his single-mindedness, and his flair. If you could say a vampire had joie de vivre, Eric had it in spades. ...more Como los otros libros de esta serie, me ha encantado!! Ni yo misma s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 le doy solo 3 estrellitas....

In this book, Sookie is recovering from her broken relationship with Bill, and overall feeling a bit down. One night, Sookie finds the Vampire Sheriff of area 5 wondering half-naked down a street by her house. Sookie takes the vampire in and gets caught up in another supernatural dilemma. Eric, the vampire sheriff, has been cursed by witches and has no memory of who he is, or who anyone is for that matter. Thanks to Sookie\u2019s brother, Jason, the vampires make a deal with Sookie to pay her to hide Eric until the problem could be resolved. If that wasn\u2019t enough, the next day, Jason goes missing, and Sookie is drawn deeper into even more conflict. On the flip side, the only comfort Sookie has is the handsome, sexy, memory-challenged vampire waiting for her at home. In short, Sookie\u2019s enmeshed in the troubles of vampires, were\u2019s, and witches\u2026oh my! I really love this book. The quality of the writing is superb, and the story is fabulous. What I like best is the story. The reader gets the chance to see the tough, manipulative Eric in a whole new light. Eric is lost and comes to depend on Sookie. The only thing that matters to Eric in this book is the woman who helped him and took him in. He gives Sookie uncomplicated support when she needs it most, and I found myself completely softened to his character. I have to admit, chapter 6 is my favorite (**slight spoiler here**)-it includes one of the best showers ever! Beyond the steamy, uncharacteristically sensitive vampire\u2026.the witches and the were\u2019s provided great story lines as well. We were introduced to more of the local shifters around Bon Temps. Also, some important pack information came up, and on the upside, we got to see more of Alcide, and the downside, we got to see more of Debbie Pelt. Debbie Pelt provides a nemesis to Sookie, and a distraction for poor Alcide. It was fun to get to meet another group of Supe\u2019s in the story, the witches. It seems that the more Sookie spends time with supe\u2019s, there is even more to learn. Not all of this is bad, Sookie meets more local allies on her search for her missing brother. Part of why I love this book is because Sookie really starts to feel more included in this community of supernatural beings. She is needed, and very much wanted (especially by several hunky men). Of course, the book sets up plenty of story line for future Sookie books. The questions of what will happen with Eric, and with Jason, the shifters??? ...more Dead To The World is the fourth book in the Sookie Stackhouse series by popular American author, Charlaine Harris.

Her ex-boyfriend, vampire Bill, has gone to Peru when, driving home just after New Year, Sookie finds his boss, Eric, (vampire) Sheriff of Area 5, wandering, half naked, on the road near her home, with a convincing case of amnesia. What else can she do but take him home? Then, to complicate matters further, her brother, Jason goes missing. This instalment sees Sookie encountering vampires, shifters and Weres (as usual), but also Witches, Wiccans and a Fairy. She manages to get on the right side of a Were packmaster, get a marriage proposal from a shifter, save a Werewolf\u2019s life, joins the residents of Bon Temps in a search through the woods, get shot at, witness a battle between a bunch of supernaturals, and kill two people. Sookie discovers that she may not be popular with regular guys because of her gift, but the supernaturals find her attractive in spite of, or sometimes because of, it. Lots of fun! ...more After thoroughly enjoying Club Dead , this one fell short of my expectations.

And that's part of why I didn't like this as much--Eric's just not as much fun in this one. I won't wax profound over this novel. These books are the equivalent of cheesecake bites--they're addictive and you feel a little guilty for indulging in one because this is not great literature. In fact, the writing really is pretty terrible, but what she lacks in writing skill Harris makes up for in a vivid imagination and a savvy for knowing how to keep us interested in the life of Sookie Stackhouse.

This series is so consistently and repetitively poor that it\u2019s hard to know how to express my disgust. I\u2019ve resorted to highlighting a few points of particular chagrin to me: Most nonsensical point: \u201cThe Hotshot kids who attended the Bon Temps school always stuck together,and they were all a smidge . . . different. It didn't surprise me at all that Crystal lived in Hotshot.\u201d States Sookie. Fair enough. Crystal is odd. Sookie is judgemental. Why would it surprise Sookie that Crystal is from a nearby centre of oddness? Except that Sookie hasn\u2019t yet met Crystal, and has no idea she\u2019s a bit odd. All she knows about her is her name, and that she\u2019s been seen with Jason. Either a continuity error or an indication that all Jason\u2019s sexual conquests have mental health problems by default, due to some as-yet undiscussed predilection of his. Most notable inconsistency: So far in the series Vampires are the only \u201cSupes\u201d to have made their existence public knowledge. I know this to be the case because Harris restates it in full at least twice per book. So when Sookie goes to visit a fellow waitress who specifically stated she hardly knows Sookie, why do they immediately begin chatting about werewolves without even a vestige of tact or concealment? Not a very effective means of keeping the secrets of a group of potentially deadly monsters. Possibly it was ill-advised of so many \u201cSupes\u201d to have trusted the most air-headed idiot in the Western Hemisphere with the knowledge of their existence. Then again, they are all sexually obsessed with her, so I suppose it was inevitable. Not sure how the other waitress knows though. Perhaps werewolves are an open secret in the service industry? Stupidest assumption: That becoming a Wiccan entails immediately dying your hair \u201cmatte black and spiked.\u201d having four piercings in each ear, becoming anorexic and having cheap jeans. I think Harris is thinking of goths. Unfortunately she has apparently never met any, and has to base her description of them on a \u201cFreak to Chic\u201d episode of Ricki Lake she vaguely remembers from a few years back. Either that or she\u2019s just an idiot. Worst Lines: Most of the sex scene in Chapter 6, particularly: \u201cYikes. Yahoo. Yum\u201d Not appropriate in a sex scene. Or indeed ever. \u201cI kind of folded Mr. Happy up against Eric's stomach, so I could reach around him and get my fingers on that absolutely gorgeous butt.\u201d No. No, no, no, no. \u201cthe truth was it hurt to remember my previous one-man status, now gone for good.\u201d Easily discarded, suddenly lamented, immediately forgotten again. Not only hypocritical, but a bizarrely old-fashioned concept to raise in the first place. \u201cmy breasts, which were practically quivering like puppies who wanted to be petted.\u201d There is summat seriously wrong with Harris if she considers this an acceptable sentence. Finally the scene is topped-off with Sookie reassuring Eric about his penis size. An insecurity you would have thought he\u2019d have been able to overcome in 1000+ years, but it appears not. All-in-all, appalling. Worst Compliment \"You have the most beautiful breasts I've ever seen.\u201d From Eric. Whilst he has amnesia. Making Sookie\u2019s effectively the only breasts he has ever seen, and his schoolboy flirting pretty poorly thought-through. Least self-aware statement: \u201cI had never realized a woman could have to struggle to keep her hands off a man.\u201d Strange, since Sookie has found herself in exactly this predicament at least three times per book so far in the series. Even if she has no knowledge of the world whatsoever, you would assume she could remember her own life experiences. Particularly since random bursts of pathetic and unrealistic lust are the only emotions Sookie experiences other than self-pity, cute annoyance, and deep pain when her hair or clothing is disarranged. Greatest Display of Social Ignorance: 1.\tReligion \u201cOddly, my first feeling was one of embarrassment, when I heard Holly tell me that she was a non-Christian. I'd never met anyone who didn't at least pretend to be a Christian or who didn't give lip-service to the basic Christian precepts.\u201d Nobody at all Sookie? Bearing in mind that you have met countless vampires including one who is a 1000+ year old Viking, werewolves, shape-shifters, several serial killer, a maenad and a goblin? All of whom you are absolutely sure are Christians? Even though at least one of them is specifically a follower of a pre-Christian god? Gods, you\u2019re stupid. To add to this, Sookie is the kind of selfish, canting Christian who can disapprove of sex outside marriage and/or with numerous partners whilst excusing herself because: \u201cI figured God had made me with the disability of telepathy, and he could cut me a little slack on the sex thing\u201d Fair enough Sookie. You are special and no one has ever suffered like you. On no account rethink your prescriptive moral beliefs when you find them to be unliveable. Just continue judging everyone else for not abiding by them whilst assigning yourself a convenient get-out clause. 2.\tGender Politics Sookie is the kind of modern, post-feminist woman who considers an offer from a middle-aged stranger to physically protect her in return for sexual favours and the right to own her as being pretty gentlemanly and \u201cnot something to get all snitty about\u201d. After all, he didn\u2019t use any bad language or innuendo when making the offer. How chivalrous of him. 3.\tInternational Politics and History \u201cbad should be overcome. That's the American model.\u201d Not just ignorant, but also massively offensive. Stupidest conceptual opposition \u201cAny red-blooded male who'd ever gone hunting,\u201d versus \u201cany P.C. guy who photographed nature\u201d Two clearly defined and obviously contrasting groups if you have a low IQ and fail to grasp the concept of Political Correctness almost completely. Least imaginative description: \u201cthe sow collapsed and died. She reeked of pig and blood.\u201d Thanks Sookie. You really evoked the experience of seeing a hog shot. Smelly, like pig and blood. Brilliant. Recurring elements of which I am bored: In each Sookie Stackhouse book so much previous plot and so many old characters are re-described in terms almost identical to the last occasion(s) they were mentioned, that I can only assume that Harris\u2019s main writing tool is the copy-paste shortcut. Some of the numerous examples include: \u2022\tBubba. Just stop. \u2022\tSookie continuously sexually harassed as a form of courtship. \u2022\tWeirdly-detailed description of the lay-out of Sookie\u2019s house, and which parts she lives in to keep her utility bills low. Why does Harris feel the need to keep telling me this? \u2022\tSookie pulling her hair back into a pony tail over and over again. Thanks Sookie, but I\u2019m now more than aware of your favourite hairstyle. Plus it\u2019s not adding a great deal to my enjoyment of the book. \u2022\tSookie reiterating that she has had any number of sexual fantasies about Sam, or Alcide, or Eric, or whichever other man has just entered the room. \u2022\tSookie describing in mind-numbing detail the clothes and hair of everyone she meets, plus the dullest items of furniture and architecture in any room she enters, no matter how many times she has already done so. With all this listing and obsession with detail, I\u2019m beginning to wonder if Sookie is borderline autistic. \u2022\tSookie stating that she is on a learning-curve. If that\u2019s the case Sookie, then why in 4 books have you learnt nothing whatsoever? Other than new vocabulary from your oddly-appropriate word-of-the-day calendar, obviously. \u2022\tSookie stating \u201cI\u2019m not educated, but I\u2019m not dumb.\u201d Yes you are Sookie. Spectacularly dumb. As well as being extremely defensive. Hence your constant insistence that you couldn\u2019t get on at school purely because of your telepathy, even though working in a crowded bar gives you little or no trouble. And finally, how can any writer be as unimaginative and stupid as to call the main Wiccan character Hallow? I would like to think that these books can\u2019t get any worse, but if this is the best Harris can manage four books in then I guess there\u2019s not much hope of improvement. ...more Rating: 3.9* of five The Publisher Says : In Sookie Stackhouse\u2014a Southern cocktail waitress with a supernatural gift\u2014Harris has a created a heroine like few others, and a series that puts the bite back in vampire fiction.

It's Eric the vampire\u2014but now he's a kinder, gentler Eric. And a scared Eric, because whoever took his memory now wants his life. My Review : Sookie's life isn't dull, is it? I'd hate to be a character written by Harris, because one thing would be sure and certain. I'd never get a single uncomplicated moment's peace. Bill's the ex, Eric's the new boy, and Jason (Sookie's playa of a brother) has vanished. That right there, in a person's real life, would be enough for a Jamaican escape cruise and a year of therapy to be necessary. Sookie, she gets no rest. She's got a powerful ancient vampire living in her basement, bereft of his memories and therefore stripped to his essential nature. That he also happens to be a gigantic, gorgeous blond Viking with a millennium's-worth of sex secrets to share (the mind might forget but the body doesn't) makes Sookie's rebound from her breakup with Bill one heckuva lot of fun, in the sack at least. It's that pesky out-of-bed world. Eric's memory was taken from him for a reason. There's a new group in Shreveport with domination of the supernatural community on their minds, the witches. Some bad, bad witches. With some really nasty plans for Shreveport, and getting rid of Eric is step one. He's the supernatural law, after all. Sookie struggles with the fear and grief of losing her brother, her one surviving blood relative, throughout the book. It just can't be good that Jason's vanished after starting a relationship with a werepanther girl. Calvin Norris, the leader of the bizarre werepanther community of Hot Shot (out at the ancient native trails crossroads near Bon Temps), adds to the complexity of the situation by getting a little bit of a Thing for blonde, busty bimbo-lookin' Sookie-with-the-special-powers. Sookie's world, once devoid of companionship, now teems with people of both genders, all imaginable persuasions, and every conceivable level of bizarreness, all wanting a piece of the woman, and her special mind-reading powers. She was isolated, and now being left alone sounds awful good. She battles the dark witches, she finds her brother, she sacrifices the simplicity of loving for the honorable and dutiful complexity of restoring balance to as much of the world as she can reach. It's a pretty darn spiffy, if jam-packed, episode in the Stackhouse Files.

Mainly because I loved the dynamic between Sookie and the memory-addled Eric. Plus the scenes with them \"a-heming\" were HOT! And Sookie didn't really get hurt too much, a nice change from the previous stories. Once again, Bill was absent for most of the book, which was fine by me. I much more enjoy Sookie's interactions with Eric, Alcide and Sam. What did confuse me a bit was him suddenly showing up for the fight and then when the fight was over nothing.

I much more enjoy Sookie's interactions with Eric, Alcide and Sam. What did confuse me a bit was him suddenly showing up for the fight and then when the fight was over nothing. It was like he had disappeared again, Sookie never even mentions him before she walks out. So this book opened up some questions for the rest of the series. Will Jason being kidnapped, held against his will for so long and now turning into a half man half panther creature every full moon change his attitude? Will Alcide find out Sookie killed his horrible girlfriend Debbie after Debbie tried to kill Sookie? Will Eric remember anything about his memory-lapsed time with Sookie, including their relationship and where he buried Debbie's corpse? Will Bill finally stop acting like an a**hole? This book had two seperate storylines again (Jason's kidnapping and Eric's memory-loss/fight with the Witches) but in this story, as apposed to Book #2, they were dealt with equally and even overlapped slightly although one had nothing to do with the other when everything was resolved. This is one of my more favorite books so far, simply because I loved Eric and Sookie together, just like I loved Alcide and Sookie together. I fear in books to come, due to Eric regaining his memory and Debbie being dead, Sookie's relationships with these two men will alter forever. ...more I rarely read romance novels or chick lit, so I'm not the usual audience for this type of novel, which may explain my rating compared to others here.

Having Sookie get attacked/beat up in every book--sometimes more than once--was also getting a bit tiresome. This book is where I finally gave up on the series, however. Harris falls back on the tired and very overused plot device of amnesia. Gorgeous but egotistical vampire Erich has been cursed by witches and lost his memory, so Sookie takes care of him while helping his vamp friends find those that cursed him. Bill is gone and the 'new' Erich is kind and loving, everything the old Erich was not, and he and Sookie quickly become lovers. A bloody battle with the witches takes place and--surprise--the curse is removed, Erich reverts to his old personality and Bill comes back to town at the end.

She's a working class sex-positive (too much so but I love her anyway), funny, feisty, too humble without being a whinger, capable and ridiculously brave bar waitress with a bit of a gift/disability of the paranormal variety and the tendency to bed vampires (and flirt with anything else hot, male and supernatural).

She's a small town girl, a Christian, so heterosexual you would think I can;t relate to her! She accepts gifts and domineering advice from horrid males that I want to punch for the things they say and presume, then beds them and enjoys the hell out of it but somehow despite a crap income and every man in the universe wanting to bed/marry her manages to keep her independence (as in her home, job and her attitude). In this one her casanove of a brother, Jason is missing presumed murdered by evil witches, her boyfriend is off in Peru trying to get over her and one of his vampire associates, Eric manages to weasel his way into her...um...er...well she found him naked wandering on the road with amnesia so what else would you do? As well as the evil witches, bar owning vampires, patriarchal werewolves and other shape shifters there is a hot and enigmatic fairy also various bar staff who are in most cases more than they seem. Nearly everything male wants to jump nearly everything female and vice versa which in almost any other book would be irritating but Sookie gets a lot of respect from me for being wry and not-sickeningly humble and working class. She may be hot but she ACTUALLY doesn't know it, she's not being coy she just doesn't get it! There's also a level of sweetness to most of the characters which makes me forgive them when they are being irritating...mostly. Seen through Sookie's eyes at any rate they are ok. A respectable 3 stars for being a fun way to while away my time. No revolution here, apart from having vampires without losing your sense of humour. ...more Bill, like a bad rash, keeps trying to come back.

I'm highly happy I decided to re-pickup these books. I think it was the inclusion of the Sookie/Eric storyline and less of a focus on Bill - seeing her move on and find her way after everything that's happened and still stay strong - that made it my favorite one. I also enjoyed how the other characters became a focus and began to grow on me.

I'm happy they didn't kill Jason off because I love how he'll also become a more prominent character. I think all of this culminates greatly as the series is growing to include more, something I always like in books. Definitely continuing on. ...more \u201cMy gran had always told me that a woman--any woman worth her salt--could do whatever she had to.\u201d Sookie and Bill have called it quits on their on-again, off-again relationship, but that doesn't mean Sookie's life has gotten any easier.

Apparently, a coven of witches led by Hallow tried to extort money from Eric and took his memory. Also, Jason, Sookie's brother, is missing. Can Sookie defeat the witches, retrieve Eric's memory AND find her brother? These books are pure guilty pleasure, like eating cotton candy at the fair or ice cream on a hot day. They aren't very substantial, ground-breaking or earth-shattering, but they are fun. Reading about Sookie's life, hearing the humorous way she faces the most extraordinary circumstances are what make these books so much fun. Oh, and the deliciously, devilish Eric, with his offbeat personality! That said, while I did enjoy myself with this book, I found there were a few things that bugged me. First off, a good part of this book is spent with an amnesiac Eric. That does lend itself to some nice scenes with Eric and Sookie, but it also veers off to creepy-ville when they are exploring their, ahem, relationship. Is Eric REALLY consenting when he's not fully Eric? What does that say about Sookie, if she is ready to have \"relations\" with Eric in this state? I can't help but draw parallels to date rape and having sex while drunk - can you REALLY consent when you aren't yourself? While it's cool again to see the Eric/Sookie dynamic, it's not really Eric and Sookie - it's memory-wiped Eric and Sookie. And memory-wiped Eric really isn't Eric. (In fact, he reminded me way too much of Bill, but that could have been the narrator slipping into \"Bill's voice\" for these parts.) The second thing that bugged me was something you see all too often in series: the addition of new paranormal elements. This can be a good thing, when done well, with plenty of foreshadowing. Unfortunately, most of the time, it comes off feeling like the author ran out of things to do with her already established world. And that's kinda how I felt here. Harris couldn't think of new things to do with weres and vampires and skinchangers so she added witches and faeries. Yes, faeries. Gah. Lastly, I'm noticing more and more how harsh Sookie can be to other women. She holds them to really strict standards and often has no problems jumping in critiquing a woman's actions or appearance. We are by no means at Anita Blake level of misogyny, but it's enough to be a little disturbing. A lot of this review has been about what is WRONG with the book, but that is just because I can't add much to the many GOOD things I've already said about this book and series. It's a delightfully fluffy series, not too serious, but still able to treat the darker subjects with appropriate sobriety. Sookie's voice, upbeat and lighthearted, independent, brave and eager to act to save other's lives, is a warm welcome in such a dark and dismal genre filled with Dark and Broody Misfits. And the Eric and Sookie dynamic is very fascinating when you don't think about the potential rapey aspect. This series isn't for everyone, but I continue to enjoy myself. I think, though, it's best to read a book or two between other more substantial books than to read the entire series in one go. I found I've liked this book better than the previous two, and I think it's because I gave Sookie some time to breath. I'm definitely going to pick up book 5 in the future - after a bit of a break. ...more Ask any Sookie Stackhouse fan which book is the best in the series, and you'll be hard pressed to find one that doesn't pick Dead to the World .

This is the very best that the series has to offer. And the crowning jewel of this masterpiece: a Viking Vampire with amnesia. Thanks to the events in Club Dead , Sookie's relationship with that asshat Bill is over. And as this book begins, Bill is heading off to Peru to work on his vampire-directory project. Shortly after he leaves, Sookie finds Eric, running barefoot on an old country road with no memory of who he is or how he got there. She brings him back to her house and learns through his second-in-command Pam, that he has been cursed by a powerful witch. Her coven is now searching for him and Sookie has to hide him in her home until the vamps can smoke out the coven. At the same time, Sookie's brother Jason goes missing. And Sookie must divide her time and attention between searching for him and taking care of her houseguest. Amnesiac Eric is exactly what Sookie needs in her life. He has all the sexy of his regular self, but he is also honest, unassuming, and hopelessly crazy about Sookie. It takes very little time for her to succumb to his charms. And holy cow, their love scenes are a sight to behold! (There is a reason that romp in the shower is a series landmark unto itself.) The nefarious witch and her reign of terror ends up drawing in the Weres, which means we are treated to some more of the luscious goodness of one Alcide Herveaux. We learn more about his pack... and unfortunately, we're subjected to more Debbie as well. Let me be clear when I say, I love Eric. But Harris paints Alcide as such a great alternative in these early books --if only he could just get over that horrible, horrible woman. In addition to the introduction of Alcide's pack members, we learn more about Crystal and the shifters in Hot Shot. (They'll feature prominently in the next book.) And we meet Claudine, a Fairy who will become a big part of Sookie's life. It's hard to talk about this book without gushing. It's got the best of everything: great characters, good story, plenty of action, emotion, and hot sex. Plus Eric and Alcide. What more could a woman want? 5 stars. ...more", "Title": "Dead to the World"},
