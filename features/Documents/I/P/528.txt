I didn't pick the book up that day, but i noted it. Later, while near the bookstore I went back in and grabbed it. The idea of the book crossed a number of vectors of interest for me. War history (wait, don't stop reading yet), snipers (please, keep reading), and early 20th century Natives. I expected it to at least titillate my love of snipers, and war and the romantic ideal of Canada's native people. What happened in fact is I was reminded that the medium of the novel is meant for many things, but of all those things, first is and always will be story-telling. There are always messages, and lessons, and commentary in all human thought, and likely all stories. But its so easy to become consumed by the desire to share an ideal, an idea, a view of the world--we lose sight of the greater need. That greater need is to be captivated, carried, led into another world entirely.<---F> To be entertained and touched</---F>. To be free of our reality and it's annoyances, stresses and even sometimes joys. And, in very rare cases, we need to find a safe place to feel more fully than the concrete world might permit. And it is through great story-telling we are reminded how we can love characters in books. Be stirred and impassioned by simple words. be felt fully human-confusingly-through our emotional range and capacity to feel. This book while not the benchmark upon which to measure storytelling, was still strong enough to remind me of this need. It's the first book I can recall in some time where I could turn off my analytical mind and just go with the characters. perhaps the last was A Fine Balance. Even if you care nothing for war history, snipers, or native idealism you should read this book for its great characters and ability to bring you somewhere else for 400 pages. ...more A novel that begins at the end, and ends with a beginning.

Central to the nove A novel that begins at the end, and ends with a beginning. Three Day Road is a stunning debut from one of Canada\u2019s foremost writers, Joseph Boyden. When Xavier Bird returns from WWI addicted to morphine and wounded, his aunt Niska embarks with him on a three-day journey towards their home in the Northern Ontario bush. As Niska paddles along towards their home, the reader slides seamlessly between Xavier\u2019s remembrances of his time at war and Niska\u2019s account of Xavier as a boy. Central to the novel is the uncertain fate of Xavier\u2019s childhood friend and fellow soldier, Elijah Whiskeyjack. As Xavier and Niska make their way closer to their home, so too does a stunning revelation about Elijah and Xavier\u2019s acts creep closer. From its opening chapter, Three Day Road sets itself up as a book that would put me through the wringer. The novel\u2019s descriptive passages are evocative and powerful. As Elijah and Xavier traipse through the mud, muck, and murder of various WWI killing-fields, I could vividly imagine their struggles and the horrific scope of the world in which they were forced to survive. This is sharply contrasted with the expressive and majestic way in which Boyden paints the wild of Northern Ontario. As alluded to earlier, scenes in which Xavier shoots morphine in the canoe allow for him to slip seamlessly back to the past. The experience was much the same for me as there are never any hiccups as the novel shifts between alternate stories. The book also resonates with authenticity: the aboriginal themes, thoughts, and practices ring true and never feel forced. Indeed, the three Cree leads are strong, fully developed and interesting characters whose cultural experiences deeply influence their world-view. Elijah and Xavier both fall victim to the torrid world of residential schools, and are enticed up by the promise of glory and adventure that the war will provide. As Niska details her own life, we also see how government has smothered her culture as she clings on to her way of life. Cree mythology also plays a central part in the structure of the novel and the Bird family legacy returns time and again to drive home a powerful theme. There is so much contained in this novel that it is impossible to do it justice in a 500-word review. The story swept me away, and though it does read slowly, it never felt as if I was putting in work to finish. Xavier\u2019s childhood innocence, his devolution in Europe, and his attempted rehabilitation by his aunt are all told in tandem to make for a staggeringly ambitious first novel. The writing is rich and illustrative, the story neatly tucked into place at its conclusion, and the characters are all compelling. Though a challenging read in content, writing, and emotion, Three Day Road is essential reading for those in Canada and beyond. ...more This seemed like a serendipitous discovery when I stumbled on it in an Ontario bookshop last week.

But I had negotiated those hazards successfully. No, I meant stumbled on in the metaphorical sense that I found it by chance. Anyway, can we move on? I have a review to write. So yes, I hadn't heard of Boyden before, but clearly he's something of a literary darling north of the 49th parallel (in Canada \u2013 less sure about Kazakhstan) and this novel, his first, begins with what seems to be an entire chapter's worth of adulatory press cuttings to whet your appetite for what follows. Apparently every critic and literary prize in Canada welcomed this one with open arms and legs. By the time you have crawled out of Roman numerals and made it to the start of the story at page 1, you have been primed to be disappointed by anything less than a new Ulysses written on the Stone Tablets of Sinai, with jokes by the ghost of Lenny Bruce. It is easy to see why critics got excited about it. This story of two Cree boys from northern Ontario who become snipers in the First World War shines a light on an aspect of 1914\u201318 that most readers will know little about, and it does so in the uncomplicated, present-tense, flashback-heavy style that is so wildly popular these days. Sure enough, there was a lot here I responded to and that filled a gap untouched by my other First World War reading. It is inspired in part by the real-life Ojibwe sniper Francis Pegahmagabow, the most lethal sniper of the war and one of Canada's most decorated (who, as \u2018Peggy\u2019, hovers just off-stage at several points in the novel). But the scenes of chaos and misery from the Western Front are never allowed to take over, and they are always interspersed with chapters describing Elijah and Xavier's Cree childhood and family, juxtapositions that offer the reader a range of unusual and productive comparisons that can be made at his or her leisure. This cross-cutting between industrialised slaughter in Europe and the very different ritualised violence of \u2018native\u2019 communities reminded me of what Pat Barker attempted with Melanesian islanders in The Ghost Road , though here the conceit is built much more fundamentally into the book's structure. This is one of those books that goes for full-on immersive storytelling: it is all about spending plenty of time with these characters, seeing the trenches and the carnage of Ypres and Passchendaele through their eyes, learning, through Xavier's medicine-woman aunt, about how the boys ended up in this place so far away from home. Perhaps the overriding motif is the windigo , that figure of Algonquian mythology associated with cannibalism and insanity. Just as First Nations communities sometimes suffered outbreaks of internal violence that saw people turning in desperation to eating human flesh, so too (we are encouraged to consider) have developed nations in 1914 begun to cannibalise their own population through what seems to be nothing other than collective madness. I realized then that sadness was at the heart of the windigo , a sadness so pure that it shrivelled the human heart and let something else grow in its place. To know that you have desecrated the ones you love, that you have done something so damning out of a greed for life that you have been exiled from your people forever is a hard meal to swallow, much harder to swallow than that first bite of human flesh. Much as I enjoyed the story and the general idea, I must admit there was something about the prose style that stopped me from ever loving this book the way I'm sure many others will love it. The prose isn't bad \u2013 it just doesn't display much intelligence or wit; there's a kind of flat, undemonstrative quality to it that, perhaps, is appropriate given its narrators but that left me slightly cold. I couldn't shake off a vague sense of Creative Writing courses , reinforced not only by the present-tense narration but by the alternating narrators in different chapters, and the metaphors that tried, I thought, a little too hard to show off their cultural background (\u2018His skin is the colour of cedar ash in the setting sun\u2019). There is also a certain amount of \u2018magic Indian\u2019 stuff going on \u2013 a face-value acceptance of some of the Cree mythology and ritual \u2013 that sits very uneasily with me. Still, this is a book I'd recommend. If you want to know more about Canada's involvement in the war, and First Nations participation in particular, it's a brilliant introduction \u2013 and you'd have to be a hard-hearted reader indeed to resist the melodrama of violence and insanity that Boyden skilfully builds up for his climax. ...more Book Review: Three Day Road Joseph Boyden Viking Canada Penguin 2005 ISBN 0-670-06362-2 Once in a long while one reads a book that you cannot put down and the overall beauty of it leaves one gasping.

Three Day Road, is such a book. It tells the story of Two Cree young men who find themselves in WW I fighting in the trenches of France as snipers using their hunting and shooting skills they learned in the bush growing up near James Bay. The story begins with the protagonist, Xavier Bird, has returned from the war minus his leg and addicted to morphine. Aunt Niska, Xavier\u2019s only living relative has paddled five days against the river current to bring him home. Niska is a Cree woman who has lived in traditional ways alone in the bush much of her life except for a brief stay in a residential school as a child. The story takes place during their three day return to James Bay. Flashbacks to the battlefields of France, vividly told, and to each of their childhoods occur during times when Xavier is asleep, or drugged by the morphine that controls the phantom pain in his leg. We learn Xavier is on borrowed time as his morphine cache is nearly gone. The title Three Day Road has a truly layered meaning in the story. We learn a lot about the traditional native way of life as well as the isolation natives must endure in the world of the wemistikoshiw (the Cree word for white man). We gain a certain insight into a residential school where Cree children are taken from their homes and fat Nuns abuse little boys and punish them severely if they speak in native tongues. The historically accurate description of life in the trenches in France is excellent \u2013 on par with the likes of Pierre Berton\u2019s Vimy. Boyden\u2019s descriptive and narrative skill is terrific and a lot is included in the books 350 pages. The book is a Writers Trust Award winner and one can easily see why.

If you haven't read the book, you should read these reviews and then you may want to. But I also wish to express my gratitude to several goodreads friends, who, through their outstanding reviews, led me to two WWI novels of which I was not aware. Fear: A Novel of World War I by Gabriel Chevalier was originally published in 1930. It was the fascinating reviews of Mike and Sue that led me to a book that I was not aware of, but should have been. It deserves to have the kind of recognition and praise that is accorded All Quiet on the Western Front . It is that good. And so is Three Day Road by Joseph Boyden, published in 2005. Thanks to the great (I'm running out of superlatives) reviews of this book by Michael and Tony. I might not have found it otherwise. The interesting thing for me about the three books is that the authors are writing from three perspectives in that the first is German, the second is French, and the third is Canadian. And yet, the stories they tell about young men from three different nations fighting in the trenches in France are almost interchangeable. The leadership, civilian and military, might have differed in the three countries, but the soldiers who did the fighting were much more alike than they differed. There is a moral there. ...more This is two of my favourite reads: a \"futility-of-war\" novel by a Native Canadian writer, and with a unique Native Canadian angle.

Niska - X's auntie - welcomes a deeply changed X home, and does what she can to help X cope with all he has seen, suffered and lost. The novel is about killing and healing and incredible, profound, spirit-driven love. Of the boys for each other; of Niska for her would-be sons, and for X in particular. Love and bonds that are forged in one kind of trauma and tested in another kind of hell. Of a way of life that is lost to all kinds of wemistikishiw slaughter and madness; of transition between one way of life and another, physical, cultural, spiritual. Though I am not a masochist, both types of novels - the war novel, the Native Canadian novel - cause great pain and therefore they often feel cathartic, cleansing in some way. But more: like an atonement for my privileged whiteness and the luck of the draw time and place-wise. This idea of privilege - and how it factors into reading choices - is an interesting one to me these days (as I look at my bookshelves stacked to the brim with female authors; goodreads having made me more acutely aware of gender aspects of writing and reading). Boyden, with his sensitivity; his writing that contains such depth of raw emotion; his male-femaleness/female-maleness (as Woolf would say) - has pride of place next to Erdrich, Thomas King and Richard Wagamese; and novels like Marlantes' Matterhorn , Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five , Findley's The Wars and Wright's Meditations In Green . ...more I love Erdrich's blurb for the book: \"a devastatingly truthful work of fiction, and a masterful account of hell and healing.

He has lost a leg and is addicted to morphine. He is accompanied by his only family member, his aunt Niska, a medicine woman who raised him in remote bush after liberating him at age 5 from a residential school. A pervasive mystery for Niska is the fate of Xavier's friend and effective brother Elijah, whom she helped raise from an older age and went off to war with Xavier. The narrative skillfully alternates between Xavier's upbringing and his experience in war with Elijah, where they became snipers in the trench warfare in France and Belgium. The account of the common foot soldier's perspective on the fighting is to me on a par with \"All Quiet on the Western Front\". At the same time, the novel provides a timeless fresh vision of alienation associated the human failure of 20th century civilization through the lens of Native American culture. The transformation of his friend Elijah into an amoral killing machine epitomizes the corruption, insanity, and evils of the whole enterprise, which represents a big challenge for Niska to help Xavier recover from. ...more This is a phenomenal and haunting book.

Sure, all this is going to make my eventual professorial career in English that much more aggravating, but at least I can live with myself a little more. By now, I'd hope there were a plethora of books out there breaking the back of glorification of war. Not enough, judging by the mindless \"Support the troops!\" advertisement in my military industrial complex of a country, but every so often there's a work like this that does double, triple, however many arms of the imperialistic octopus duty. Here's this country called Canada that starves and beats and childhood traumatizes its indigenous populations (one of these so called residential schools had an electric chair for the kiddies), and off some of them go to war. If that weren't enough, intertwined with it is the staggered story of a woman of strength, culture, and the morality born of deprivation that is one of the strongest shapers of difference between the creeds and ethical codes of myriad communities. The results are harsh the world over, and one must take a good look at the human sacrifice one is accustomed to in their own plain of things before even considering analyzing those of others. In this, judging the relative merits by who is currently sitting pretty would be a poor choice indeed. I'm sure someone's tried to slap the \"magical realism\" label on this once or twice due to the beliefs the narrative accredits via constant and rewarded usage. What limits this in the initial stages is how comprehensive the descriptions are in describing bodily woes that most works, even the war ones, pass on by as either negligible troubles or glossed over truths. As for the non-Christian beliefs, my atheist sensibilities have politely glided through enough theological references and plot devices that those not doing the same with this work come off more as rude than anything else. The Islamophobic fuckwads calling themselves New Atheists are bad enough. In short, this book is brutal, brutal, brutal. Read it if you want a real sense of what makes the world go round. \"I hunt for sustenance,\" I say. \"And so do I,\" Elijah answers. ...more \"I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield Down by the riverside I ain't gonna study war no more\" Three Day Road is presented as the intertwined narratives of two Cree Indians: Xavier Bird (a soldier returning from the battlefields of WWI) and his aunt Niska (a fierce Medicine Woman).

The wild Canadian North with its harsh yet beautiful landscape and tough living conditions for those surviving off the land is a far cry - physically and spiritually - from the trenches and the killing fields of Ypres and the Somme. Yet, Boyden has successfully merged these seemingly disparate themes through his telling of the life stories of the three protagonists: Xavier, Elijah and Niska. The two young friends, looking for adventure, joined the war effort while Niska carries on her life as the last Oji-Cree medicine woman. The story is told from different perspectives, moving backwards and forwards in time. The outcome is an engrossing narrative that interweaves the disturbing description of WWI horrors in the trenches with the rich and multifaceted recollections of the protagonists' lives and their emotions and experiences of the past. \"Taking the Three Day Road\", the traditional Cree reference to dying, takes on new meaning here, both literally and spiritually. The journey home in Niska's canoe through the lush forests and on the winding river provides the backdrop to her efforts to bring one of the friends home, physically and mentally deeply wounded. Her personal recollections and stories of their past lives are set against the nightmarish dreaming of the returning soldier. Will Niska be able to soothe the mind, will the medicine be strong enough to heal him from the agony of war? The two young Cree started out with eagerness to fight in the war, having honed their tracking and shooting skills in the bush killing animals for food and ceremony. Their very different characters emerge clearly as they leave the familiar territory. As they began their journey, their friendship helped them to complement each others strength to get through numerous challenges, such as the language barrier, their inexperience in urban and barrack life, the discrimination facing them. As their talent as trackers and snipers are increasingly recognized by their superiors, despite their prejudice against Indians, the two are sent on increasingly daring missions. Their reputation grows as they take out more enemy snipers than anybody else. Xavier and Elijah respond very differently to the pressure and violence. One hates his role on the killing fields and is retreating into himself, the other is thriving on the experience and the attention he garners. Their friendship is seriously tested and the tension between them reaches breaking point. How can they salvage the friendship that they had? How can they survive in the hell of the trenches? How do they cope with loosing their comrades and being wounded themselves? Will they be able to reconcile the upbringing on the land, guided by Niska, with the brutality of their war experiences? Boyden is an outstanding story teller and his skill of creating realistic and lively personalities is admirable. This not only applies to the three protagonists, but also to several of their comrades and their superiors. Boyden establishes a wide-ranging portrait of the people and the extreme conditions they were exposed to during this war. It is evident that that author undertook extensive research into the intricate details of WWI war fare. It can easily stand among the best of its kind. The author adds additional depth through Niska's story, connecting the reader intimately to Cree culture and mythology. Niska's voice stays with you for a long time. Despite the topic, this is a beautifully written, memorable book. I read this book in 2006, but never posted a review on GR. So here it is. ...more This is an exceptional book, although harrowing - I'm not sure I could say I enjoyed it; my feeling is closer to respect, and admiration, for what the author achieved.

Three Day Road is the story of two young Cree men who volunteer for service in WWI. Only one returns - Xavier - and the novel follows his progress as he travels back downriver, with his aunt, to his home. He's broken, physically and mentally, by the war, is addicted to morphine, and as he slips back into the past and relates the story of his war, we also learn of his aunt's history - she tells her stories to keep him rooted in the Cree world, so that he can make it back from the dark places he visited in Europe. What's exceptional about this book - above and beyond the writing - is WWI seen through the eyes of a Cree man. Proportionally, more Native men signed up for service in WWI than any other racial or ethnic group, yet their very different perspective on what was going on is rarely explored in novels or non-fiction works. Here, Xavier pulls us into a radically different understanding of the war - a place where his skills, obtained on the hunt, are in high demand, but his identity as Indian is derided; a place where his friend perhaps becomes windigo under the pressure of war; a place where it seems that the western God must be a warrior, not a man in league with forgiveness, for why else would soldiers call out his name as they rush to kill others? There's a wonderful opposition set up through his experiences and his aunt's memories. While the Canadian authorities believe the Cree who - like his aunt and her mother - choose to live in the bush are violent, uncivilized, savage creatures, they're the ones to whom those words apply in war. Disturbing and haunting, this is a great book. But I'd recommend reading it daylight, if you read it at all. ...more Xavier Bird, a young Ojibwa from the Moose Cree tribe in northern Ontario, returns to Canada from the Europe's Western Front in the summer of 1919. He is alone, in unimaginable pain from an amputated leg, addicted to morphine, and dying from a spirit broken by the nightmare of war. Carrying him home in her dugout canoe is his aunt Niska, an elderly medicine woman who has lived on her own in the bush since escaping a Catholic boarding school in her teens. Through a twisting, dreamlike journey of Xavier Bird, a young Ojibwa from the Moose Cree tribe in northern Ontario, returns to Canada from the Europe's Western Front in the summer of 1919. He is alone, in unimaginable pain from an amputated leg, addicted to morphine, and dying from a spirit broken by the nightmare of war. Carrying him home in her dugout canoe is his aunt Niska, an elderly medicine woman who has lived on her own in the bush since escaping a Catholic boarding school in her teens. Through a twisting, dreamlike journey of words and images we follow Xavier and Niska on a three-day river trail home. The journey takes us through the years of these characters' lives. To distract Xavier from his pain and to quell her own anxiety over his addiction and the emotional wounds that she cannot heal, Niska recounts her childhood as European settlers closed in on her tribe's ancestral territories. She reveals how she survived and thrived on her own, fell in love with a French trapper, learned to use her healing and divining powers, and how she saved Xavier from subjugation at the hands, whips and rum of the white settlers. Xavier crossed the Atlantic as a Canadian Army private with his best friend, Elijah Weesageechak (\"Whiskeyjack\" to non-Cree speakers). Elijah had spent his early years at a Catholic boarding school and is fluent in English, but ignorant of his tribe's hunting, tracking and survival skills. He is reclaimed by the Cree forest and comes of age with Niska and Xavier. Xavier is a patient teacher and Elijah a crack student. By the time the young men arrive in Europe, their marksmanship skills are renowned. They are selected to train with an elite group of snipers. Xavier is soon overshadowed by Elijah's charisma and ego but the two remain a team during their nearly two years on the battlefields of France and Belgium. Why Xavier returns to his homeland alone becomes the thread of tension that reverberates keenly to the final pages. This is a beautifully written yet brutal novel. Each modern war has its unique horrors. Three Day Road mires the reader in the muck of World War I trench warfare as bodies pile in corners, lice pulse in clothing seams, and toes rot black with trench foot. Boyden spares no detail of hand-to-hand combat, of the blood-lust that becomes the sole means of emotional survival for some soldiers, of the ache for the relief of morphine. The devastation is so relentless, you understand any soldier's break with reason, you feel their uncontrollable rage and their sense of hopelessness as they accept that each moment may be their last. It is Boyden's storytelling ability and his skills in pacing and tension that keep the gore from overwhelming the narrative. The characters who ripple through bring life and dimension to the battlefields, farmland, forest and hearths of Europe and Canada. This is historical fiction at its finest: a scholar's command of factual detail balanced by a storyteller's heart and passion. Niska provides us with historical context, telling the story of northern First Nations in the early part of the 20th century. Xavier's story is eternal lesson that nothing good comes of war, a lesson we seemed destined to repeat and fail at least once each generation. I'm glad I waited a few more days to compile my Best Reads of 2011 list. Three Day Road will surely appear in the top ten. ...more Xavier Bird of the Cree Nation grew up in a world of peace and solitude, hunting moose and grouse along the edge of Hudson's Bay in Northern Ontario in the early 1900s. Answering the call of The Great War, he and his closest friend, Elijah, head into the big city to enlist in the Canadian Army. As a Cree-speaking native, he is excluded from the camaraderie of his platoon and shunned for his cultural heritage, lack of English and quiet nature.

Answering the call of The Great War, he and his closest friend, Elijah, head into the big city to enlist in the Canadian Army. As a Cree-speaking native, he is excluded from the camaraderie of his platoon and shunned for his cultural heritage, lack of English and quiet nature. As a gifted sniper, the atrocities that he witnesses throughout the battles of St Eloi, The Somme and Vimy Ridge deeply affect him and his outlook on life's purpose. Drawing strength from his heritage and his aunt Niska's teachings, he is able to see past the war. But these same experiences destroy his friend Elijah, who becomes addicted to morphine and falls into madness while surrounded by death. Xavier can do nothing but stand by and watch as Elijah descends into a living hell. At the end of WW1, Xavier finds himself badly injured in hospital, declared a hero and sent back home to the Canadian north. His sole relative, aunt Niska, meets his train and paddles him back up the river to their secluded home. Over these three days of travel, his aunt reminisces about her own life as well as Xavier and Elijah's youth and tries to convince Xavier to choose life. Boyden tells an amazing story. The chapters are interwoven between Niska's memories and Xavier's war experiences allowing us to see the connection they have while separated. I was able to feel the pull of Xavier's heritage while he ventured in this foreign world. It is fascinating to learn that Francis Pegamagabow -an Ojibwa sniper in WW1 - was the real life inspiration for this book. I can't wait to read more of Boyden's books. ...more I first heard about this book a couple years ago on the Today show. At first it was hard to take a Today show book club selection seriously, but then I decided to listen to what the star author had to say about the book. Isabel Allende introduced Three Day Road, and her enthusiasm for the story really intrigued me. She writes in a completely different genre (magical realism) from what she decribed this book to be (WWI historical fiction), so I thought I should give it a shot.

And I decided to wait until it came out on paperback, and boy do I wish I had read this earlier. What an amazing story!! It's one of those books I could hardly wait to get into bed to read each night. For a debut author, Joseph Boyden is an incredible story teller. He manages to weave several stories into one, paralleling them at the right moments so it amazingly doesn't seem forced or unfocused. I know just enough about Indian story telling to feel that Boyden honestly captures Amerindian culture and thought, and he also captures the horror and honesty of war, including drug addiction, trench warfare, the cruelty of seasons, and the level of spirituality those can receive and achieve from suffering in such horrid conditions in a way few writers can. ...more Outstanding novel.

I think this is the first book I can remember that honors Native contributions to the Canadian forces in Europe (although I am sure they exist). One can also follow the unraveling of a good soldier maddened by his participation as a sniper and scout, the sacrifice of soldiers in this horrible war. I really enjoyed this and recommend it. ...more \u062a\u0627 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0627\u06cc \u0632\u06cc\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0646\u062f\u0645 \u06a9\u0647

An even more astonishing first novel. There can be no disputing Joseph Boyden is not only an accomplished story-teller, but a significant Canadian voice in the 21st century. Three Day Road , drawn from real people and real history, is an impeccably researched, and skilfully wrought tale of two Cree soldiers who fight in the nightmare of WWI. It is a story about the terror of residential schools, the descent into madness, and the arduous journey back to peace of mind and body. An astonishing novel. An even more astonishing first novel.

Loved that I learned about new aspects of WWI (new to me, that is) and Native Canadian culture. I was actually told to read Through Black Spruce before I stumbled on this one--JB's first novel--and I'm so glad that I did. Literature at its finest! Take a bow Mr. Boyden. I am wemistikoshiw , so I don't and won't pretend to understand what it is to be Oji-Cree -- nor any other nation for that matter. I pass no judgment on their beliefs, their lives, their experiences, their ways, but I do feel the great of weight personal disgust and guilt all wemistikoshiw should feel for the genocide of their peoples and cultures our ancestors began, which we carry on every day. I've been the lover of a Cree woman, a woman I still love and always will, but I have no illusions th I am wemistikoshiw , so I don't and won't pretend to understand what it is to be Oji-Cree -- nor any other nation for that matter. I pass no judgment on their beliefs, their lives, their experiences, their ways, but I do feel the great of weight personal disgust and guilt all wemistikoshiw should feel for the genocide of their peoples and cultures our ancestors began, which we carry on every day. I've been the lover of a Cree woman, a woman I still love and always will, but I have no illusions that my love for her makes me any less wemistikoshiw , any less culpable for what has been done to the proud nations she sprang from. The most I can ever hope to attain is empathy, an incomplete understanding, and a heart willing to hear Indigenous stories coupled with a resolve to do what I can when I can. Joseph Boyden 's Three Day Road is, I think, an Indigenous story gifted to we wemistikoshiw (at least in part). As Boyden spoke through Niska and Xavier and Elijah, and as the voices of Niska and Xavier made Boyden fade away, I began to hear whispers of \"let me tell you this wemistikoshiw \" and \"have you thought of this wemistikoshiw \" and \"don't ignore this wemistikoshiw \" because what I was being told, what the whispers were speaking of, were things too important to be ignored. Yes there is a terrifying and even sometimes thrilling tale of trench warfare in World War I in the foreground of Three Day Road , but there is so much more being told to us. It is telling us about the end of a way of life. I may think it was a beautiful way of life, others may think it was backwards, still others may think it was \"heathen,\" but what really matters is that it was a way; it was valuable; it deserved better. It is a story of how that way was ended, of the ways colonization tore down, took away, raped, brainwashed, manipulated, murdered or slowly eroded through attrition. It is the effects and affects of colonization and how there is no post-colonial period for Indigenous North Americans. There is only colonization. Niska and Xavier are whispering these things to the wemistikoshiw because we need to hear them and do more than hear them. We need to take them into our everyday lives. To look in the mirror at our own wemistikoshiw visages and see all of those whispers written there. Three Day Road is rich with meaning, bursting into the mud like the largest shells Fritz could throw at the lines, and I doubt that the multiple readings I am sure to give this novel will ever allow me to tap into them all. And maybe, perhaps, this first reaction that I've written here is the best and most important meaning I will ever take away from Three Day Road -- maybe knowing that I am wemistikoshiw , knowing and recognizing that, is exactly what the story needed me to know. ...more War is ugly and always has been; people die and usually gruesomely. But there seems to be a general consensus that the most horror-filled war was The Great War, The War to End All Wars--World War I.

Being static--unable to move, to have at least the illusion of dodging incoming artillery--did something to the psyches of the soldiers who fought in t War is ugly and always has been; people die and usually gruesomely. But there seems to be a general consensus that the most horror-filled war was The Great War, The War to End All Wars--World War I. Not before or since have armies been mired down in trenches, where it was possible to die from drowning in mud, never mind from bullets or artillery. Being static--unable to move, to have at least the illusion of dodging incoming artillery--did something to the psyches of the soldiers who fought in that war that wasn t seen until Vietnam, and for different reasons.[return][return]Two young Crees from northern Ontario enlist in the Canadian army and become part of the Southern Ontario Rifles, an outfit, that although fictional, mirrors the courage and horror of the Canadian participation in the war. In addition, being First Nation (as indigienous people are known in Canada), Xavier Bird and his best friend, Elijah Whiskeyjack, have additional challenges. Each was marked by the events in which they participated.[return][return]But this is far more than a war story with an interesting twist. It is also the story of the Crees in the early 20th century, especially those who were  bush Indians , refusing to accommodate to the white ways and living the traditional Cree way. And that we learn from Niska, a medicine woman, who leaves her home in the wilderness in her canoe to bring back her nephew Xavier, who has survived the war--but as a broken man addicted to opium. The story unfolds during the journey back to the wilderness.[return][return]Throughout is the theme of the windigo, a creature of evil that can spread like an infection. Niska s father and Niska herself are windigo killers, those recognized by the tribes as having the power, which is a gift, of ridding the tribe of these humans turned into monsters. Windigos are made, not born, and therein lies a tale.[return][return]It is a remarkable story, profound. It is told in a circular fashion, through flashbacks that are not linear--to the days when Xavier and Eilijah were hunters as boys, to the war to Niska s childhood to the present. The prose is spare, dispassionate, but the impact is searing.[return][return]This is a debut novel for Boyden, and an extremely powerful one. Highly recommended. ...more The first half of this book is not my normal favorite type, but the second half compensates for this. It deals with the wounds of war and how it can drive young men into madness with blood lust and killing, crossing a moral line that is sometimes beyond redemption and forgiveness.

Xavier and his best friend Elijah volunteered to fight in WWI. Since they are skilled hunters they quickly become snipers. Their relationship is almost symbiotic even though they are very different. Xavier is quiet and barely speaks English, while Elijah is much more talkative, outspoken and social. Elijah also cares much more about his perception as a hero and a skilled sniper. The narrative is told from two points of view, Xavier's, that came back from the war wounded and addicted to morphine, and his aunt Niska, that paddles him back home to the bush on a canoe. Xavier is hallucinating, remembering the war horrors, and Niska, telling him stories about herself and his childhood. The transitions weren't almost smooth, but overall both were very interesting. The metaphor of the three day road, and the number three which is a typological and symbolic number are everywhere. The Three Day Road that the spirit walks when someone dies in native tradition, the three days for Niska and Xavier to get from the train to the bush on the canoe, the Holy Trinity, and pretty much everything in the army. Book full of pain. War madness (I'm not going to give away how far that can go), blood lust, morphine addiction, and friendship that goes sour. 4 stars book. ...more This is the third book I read by Joseph Boyden, having previously read The Orenda, and Through Black Spruce.

It was also a wake up call that some wars have no point, and World War I certainly did not have one, even though its ramifications are still being experienced today. It also reminded me of how gullible young men can be lured to war ( we are still doing it) on the promise of better wages and glory.
