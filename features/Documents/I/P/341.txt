I have read several of this author's great short fiction and novels but was still apprehensive about the idea of reading poetry by anyone. Curiosity in the end got the better of me and what I found was fortunately a pleasant surprise. Whether these verses are inner dialogue with or about the author's surroundings (coffee places,<---M> diners or the buzz of a city)</---M>, a love letter or something comparable to a contract with his girlfriend about the foundations of their relationship, this selection of pieces is full of stimulating thought, deep philosophy and witty and mindful observation. I felt a \u201csturm und drang\u201d kind of intensity in these poems; the author shows in some of the pieces a burning desire for everything to have meaning, for every word to count, which is probably why the majority of the verses are not in rhyme which could lessen their impact on the reader. A wise choice in my view because choosing this casual verse rather than a strict formal and schematic style made the pieces very relatable and touching. I must stress that my credentials in regards to metric and tact in poetry are limited due to lack of experience with the format but I enjoyed the free style Sharpe uses. Some of the verses spoke to me very much - particularly the ones about writing, one other favourite that was called Monotony and one was about game playing and included a great analogy to a famous board game. Since the collection was written over a period of 20 years some pieces betrayed the author\u2019s age at writing them. Being a similar age as the author I recognised myself in many of the questions that so urgently pressed on the author's chest. The collection must have done well when performed live. I could almost hear some of the verses being recited at a poetry reading, slowly, with emphasis on every word, giving it all the more power. The themes cover a wide range of subjects and show a poet often at odds with the world, angry or moody and sometimes reluctantly willing or unwilling to stand up against injustice and trying to change at least the audience's perspective; it covers the world as it is and how it could be.<---F> Reading this was quite emotional</---F>. This is a remarkable collection. ...more Simply Amazing. The work contined in this book is breathtaking, sad, funny, bitter, and true. I grudgingly bought a copy on a raving recommendation from a friend, because I simply do not regularly buy books from authors I don't know. I was so impressed that I have now bought two more copies to give as gifts. There is not enough good to say about this book. I hope that eveyone can read this book and let it touch them like it has touched me. Didn't see this one coming. I should read more about the books I'm ordering before I buy them. I was a little put off at first, but that faded fast. I absolutely loved it. It's not my style, but it's all my heart and mind. I am the first to admit that I absolutely HATE poetry (hell im probably one of the fewer people who hate romeo and juliet) but i loved this collection. Dark, some erotic, and filled with angst (but not of the sparkly vampire variety). Definitely worth the read. Poetry is cool, but it's not one of my favorite genres. Sharpe's poetry stands alone. It's raw, it's real, it's emotional, and it's deep, written from the heart. There is a lot of emotion and just raw real life that shines through these poems. A good, if not always easy, read. A must for any poetry fan.<---A>Dennis Sharpe</---A><---C>Dennis Sharpe</---C><+++>The Years Distilled: Verses</+++>", "Title": "The Years Distilled: Verses"},
