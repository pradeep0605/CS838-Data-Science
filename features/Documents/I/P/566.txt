{"Comments": "I don't like Mac.<---F> I don't like Barrons</---F>. I'm not even really enjoying the story. So why keep reading, you might ask. Masochism?

Probably a little of all three. Once we get into the meat of the story, it's very plain to see that Mac hasn't changed, although she sure would like us to think so. She goes on and I don't like Mac. I don't like Barrons. I'm not even really enjoying the story. So why keep reading, you might ask. Masochism? Some vague sense of loyalty toward friends on here who constantly berate me with, \"Keep reading, it gets better!!!\" Or, is it really just my obsessive compulsive NEED to see how something ends? Probably a little of all three. Once we get into the meat of the story, it's very plain to see that Mac hasn't changed, although she sure would like us to think so. She goes on and on about how she's isn't a dumb kid anymore and she knows more now than she did just weeks ago, but really she doesn't. She still makes dumb mistakes. She still talks about her clothes and appearance. She still keeps Barrons in the dark with things she should have told him in the first place to save them both from trouble. If anything, she acts MORE arrogant and entitled in this book than the last. She's a fancy sidhe-seer now, she doesn't need to worry about some pesky humans. \"My problems were so much bigger than this. It was an epic waste of my time.\" She says this after being interrogated about the death of a human. She wanes back and forth over wanting to save all of humanity or only caring about herself and her family. If you save the world, then you ultimately save your family. She's still very selfish and immature in this book and it's hard to take her seriously. My main problem with Glam-girl Mac and fierce sidhe-seer Mac is the inconsistencies that pop up. True, these trials she's gone through were thrusted upon her and she's dealt with them in a very short amount of time. But she constantly slides back to the Before Mac so much that you want to just slap some sense into her. Stop flirting with boys. Quit getting dressed up in nice clothes. Don't go blurting to a stranger/sidhe-seer in public that you can see the Fae too. If you want me to think you're serious about being a badass and that you've changed, (<---B>like you've told me NUMEROUS times throughout this book,</---B>) then actually SHOW me with your actions. Get serious, train, learn some basic self defense at least! If your problems are as big as you think, then prepare for them. Don't tell me you've changed when you haven't. Barrons is still a dick. He abuses her and she makes excuses for him. I think I know who/what he is though. I won't say though, but I have told a certain someone who shares my prediction. We'll see if we're right. V'Lane is ... interesting. I compared him to Mircea from the Cassie Palmer series, and even though I fear being flayed alive by The Flooze, he's the best comparison I can make. They're both insanely gorgeous, immortal, want a lowly human woman who has unique powers, and view humans as tools to further their goals. I find him to be the most interesting character in the whole series. A couple of nitpicks that probably won't bother many people, but did bother me: Spoilers for Darkfever: (view spoiler) [Regarding the cars parked in the alley. Why leave them? Why not hire someone to come pick them up and dispose of them. Barrons has to be familiar with a chop shop or two. If a bunch of people were murdered and their cars were left behind my work and/or place of residence, I would find some way to get rid of them so I couldn't be interrogated about them. If the cars hadn't been there, O'Bannion's brother wouldn't have had a reason to grill Mac and be suspicious of the book store though. I hate when the plot is forced in this manner. (hide spoiler) ] The use of acronyms. I can't imagine Barons saying OOP. I understand the need for acronyms, they do have their place, but it bothers me when it's constantly used in a novel. Just spell your words out! Asking question after question after question. Do we really need one or more paragraphs of just questions that Mac is thinking in her head? There has to be a better way to integrate this into the novel. The constant spewing of metaphors. People don't think or talk like that, so stop it . I thought this book was weaker than the last, and I felt angrier while reading it. Maybe I shouldn't have waited so long in between books and let people gently (and not so gently) prod me into reading this. Is it possible that all of the hype surrounding this series and the recent release of Shadowfever has soured my experience? It's very possible. I am trying to give this series a chance, but so far it hasn't won me over. Here's my review of the first book, Darkfever . ...more 4.5 Mac Version 2.0 Mac has started to change, she originally was that southern Barbie girl who loved pink, cute accessories and fab nail polish. That girl is still inside her battling with the new Mac she is becoming. Why is she changing? Because every time she turns around someone is either lying to her or some Fae petunia-hole is trying to kill her. Then we have Jerrico Barrons. He tries my nerves a bit in this book...and then in the last 50 or so pages-I get hooked.

He tries my nerves a bit in this book...and then in the last 50 or so pages-I get hooked. The tension between him and Mac finally really heats up. Moning really writes the sexual tension part very well. It's really not a cheesey as my barbies portray. It's fecking hawt. This book did start slowly because it contains a whole lot of filler for what is to come, and it's not the greatest series that ever lived...but it is one of the ones that are just pure fun. And what becomes of our girl Mac? She starts to grow some big ole balls. ...more Updated 12/10/14 Oh, poor me, drowning in mysteries.

It actually shows how well planned this whole series had been. First I want to thank Kat for recommending this series to me. So far it's been exceeding my expectations and I hope it will continue doing so. In this installment MacKayla Lane continues her search for Sinsar Dubh, a powerful Unseelie artifact containing the deadliest Fae magic. She is recovering from the ordeal she experienced at the end of the previous book and at the same time has to face the aftermath of her actions - Inspector O'Daffy is getting very interested in finding out more about the Dark Zone and why Mac is not going back home; Malluce's death is still uncertain; Rocky O'Bannion's brother, Derek, surfaces to poke around in Mac's business; and finally, a mysterious specter keeps following MacKayla around giving her creeps... In my opinion, <+++>Bloodfever</+++> is even better than Darkfever . The Fae world is getting wider, Moning gets us deeper into the lore which is very exciting. We get to know Mac much better and I like her quite a bit. I like her humor and her upbeat personality, I enjoy seeing her grow and change and learn about her abilities. Death-by-sex Fae Prince V'lane is even more mysterious and his intentions toward Mac are unclear. Same applies to Barrons, who is a total enigma. The Mac/Jericho chemistry is off the charts! I simply LOVE these two. Jericho is slowly but surely climbing up the list of my favorite fictional hunks, but he'd better stop roughing up Mac if he ever wants to get to the top of it, because I don't care for this kind of thing. All in all, a great book. It doesn't have much of a resolution in terms of the main story arc (which is not a problem for me), but the minor story arc is as interesting, intense, dark and edgy. I am planning to get my hands on Faefever very soon. ...more Possible minor spoilers if you haven't read the first book and if any of my random ramblings turn out to be true... At the beginning of the book, we join Mac just after she finds out that she was adopted. Immediately, she begins to act like her parents just dropped off the face of the earth, and she starts referring to her sister as her only real family. Her attitude instantly turned ungrateful.

At the beginning of the book, we join Mac just after she finds out that she was adopted. Immediately, she begins to act like her parents just dropped off the face of the earth, and she starts referring to her sister as her only real family. Her attitude instantly turned ungrateful. Yes, she was just being a drama queen, but I know for a fact that you can love someone who isn't related to you just as much as someone who is. The fact that she is not technically related to them doesn't mean that they are no longer her family. That's really my only gripe about Mac in this book. I still think she kicks ass, just give your parents some credit! She actually had the guts to say \"He was lucky I was even calling him Dad at all!\" Really? At least she recanted it fairly quickly when he shows up all worried about her. After that, she seems mostly back to normal with them again. I'm starting to feel bad for Mac, though. I mean she's been mystically undressed and nearly performing involuntary sex acts in public (who hasn't?), rape-kissed by a drunken Irish man (uh, ditto), hit on by two seemingly normal history nerds (I persist, who hasn't?) and she's also teased inexorably, and now kissed and dry-humped, by the hot man she spends 90% of her time with (who wouldn't want to be?) yet she STILL isn't getting any. I'll warn you now that when i start to think about Jericho, my mind goes into a mixed state of paranoia and reckless abandon. It's no secret how I feel about Barron's name. But the way I feel in general about Jericho Zigor Barrons, or as I like to call him, J-Ziggy, is best summed up with this redonkulously articulate rant: love love loooooove adore gaaaaawd hellaluyah ahgagwhjrhfjfjkd mothreffenyes ahhhhhhhh!! !#%@?!/%#+!)$:\u00a0*confetti popping out of head* Barrons is standoff-ish, confident and snarky, yet endlessly intriguing. He is the kind of guy who can make you feel everything and nothing at the same damn time. Not to mention, he likes to chain up women while they are wearing skimpy bikinis. Cough*jabbathehutt*Cough. Except, I probably wouldn't mind being chained up by him. Barrons, I mean, not Jabba. Obviously. Oh shiz! Why does Barrons have chains readily available in his basement???? For chaining up people as he feeds on them? For chaining up the Seelie? What-the-fa??? Fuuuuuudgin Fudge! He's Unseelie, isn't he?!?! It's a rhetorical question! Dang it! I don't want to know, wait, yeah I do. No. No, I don't. Yeah, I'm going crazy and I tried to warn you. Uh. Now I'm freaked out. Anyway, sooooo, I was thinking about who could pull off playing him in a movie. It would have to be someone very good with the eyes. Jeric-- er, Barrons uses a lot of non-verbal communication, which I find very sexy. So it would have to be someone like Ian Somerhalder AKA 'Smolder'holder. He is really very good with the \"looks\" but I'm not sure he could pull off the really long hair that Barrons has. And he's awfully pale, so not necessarily him. Ideas, anyone? Ah who cares, I just wanted to think about him. *sigh* I also have to give a big \"hell yeah\" to Mac for not caving to the demands of any of the several groups of people vying for her servitude. She refuses to take the easy way out and be ordered around blindly for each one's \"higher\" purpose. Not even with Barrons. Proudly and unbiasedly, she chooses her own higher purpose, and I have to applaud her for that. Like she herself says, she is no one's puppet, which cannot be said for many heroes or heroines in fantasy novels. Normally, someone discovers them, tells them about their abilities, teaches them to harness their powers, and then tells them exactly what to do with them. She does her best to not let that happen and chooses what she thinks is best, not what the others tell her is. The author's knack for introducing small amounts of information at a time, interspersed amongst the action, leads to a captivating experience. Too much information is never given up. We the readers, like Mac, have to earn the privilege of learning more about this strange world. There are no info-dumps in this series. And I appreciate it. In short, I loved it. And Eeeep! There's the next one sitting on my shelf!! This one ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, so I think I have to go now... Can't wait to get back to Barrons. *sigh* My review for the first book, Darkfever . Spoiler FREE. For the third book, Faefever . Spoiler FREE. The fourth book, Dreamfever . Spoiler FREE. The fifth and final book, Shadowfever . Spoiler alert!!! ...more 4.5!! Done! I'm just ripping through this series, it's quite addicting! This one was just a little better than the fist book, they both ended too soon, but I like how satisfying it is to finish these short books. I'm having a lot of fun with this, just the right amount of action and plot but the romance is one slowwwwwww burn. The second installment of <+++>Bloodfever</+++> is intense, powerful, dramatic and clever. We see a great deal of character growth from out favorite characters as well as a progression in the plot, albeit a small one. The writing is, as always, stylish and immersive. The world is complicated, mysterious and intriguing. Overall, this book is a fantastic second installment in what is an amazing, refreshing and enjoyable series. PS.

MacKayla Lane has discovered and accepted and come to terms of the gift of being a sidhe seer, with special powers, one of these being the ability to sense the Sinsar Dubh, an ancient book of the blackest magic even seen, which holds the key to the balance of power between the Fae and humans. It\u2019s the only thing that will save humanity from being destroyed by the Fae. I am so totally crazy about Mac. I love her view of her world\u2026she\u2019s lost a bit of that \u201cI\u2019m so into pink\u201d\u2026not totally at this point. She realizes that she will do anything to survive..she will bend the any rules, make alliances with anyone who can help her find her sister\u2019s killer, fulfill Alina\u2019s last request before she died and the answer to what her role is in this power struggle between humans and fae? You can still feel her vulnerability, her insecurities but as she discovers more about herself, the stronger and more determined she becomes. When she says \u201cWhat had changed was me\u201d at the end, I realized how far she has come and how much more she will have to go through before finding all the answers. I loved Mac\u2019s optimism\u2026even when things look dark and scary she still tries to see a bit of \u201csun, pink\u201d ahead of her. She has such an amazing way of analyzing things that are happening in her life\u2026and wow\u2026.it\u2019s like going on a rollercoaster ride. Non-stop action!!!!!!!!!

This is not a romance series, has no or very few sex scenes but you can certainly feel the chemistry, the heat, the sizzle between him and Mac..of course both try to fight it and I can\u2019t wait to see what happens between the two.

A seelie, unseelie, druid, fae\u2026how old is this guy\u2026is he immortal \u2026\u2026she can feel something in him that is not totally human. Can she trust him? What does he want from her?

The Seelie Prince who also wants something from her\u2026but is he really who he says he is???? What does he want from Mac? She knows he is not telling her everything but she decides to forge an alliance with him as well\u2026which drives Jericho crazy of course!!!!!

What give up her spear??? Rowena is such a wicked character\u2026I so hate her and hope she comes to a really gruesome ending!!!!!!!! Her characters are so vivid, so real, so believable.

As the smart Tanya said \"she's mourning over the loss of her safe, sheltered self\". \"I missed her hair. I missed mine. I missed my her. I missed me.\" But that doesn't mean she won't fight. Barrons himself said when he thought she was all useless fluff and nails, she showed some teeth. And Barrons is, in my opinion, one of the best male characters ever written in the genre. . He's enigmatic, he's complex, he's nothing you've ever seen and at the same time he's simple. He's exactly what he shows you. And sometimes, he let himself go and say things like this: \"This wasn't what I wanted,\" Barrons was saying. \"This isn't what I would have chosen. You must know that. It's important that you know that.\" There's this moment when I think they've found themselves in common ground. They both have been broken and survived it. I think this is the moment when he sees her. And starts losing the war against himself. \"Did you break once?\" \"Yes,\" he said finally. \"Did you kill the bastard?\" \"With my bare hands. After I kill his wife.\" He waved his hand at the door of the cell. \"You lead, Ms. Lane. I've got your back.\" * CAVE SCENE. CAVE SCENE * Cave Scene. cave scene. cave scene. cave scene. Finally, I love how Mac just does what it takes in order to survive. She said it herself. There's no black and white. \"There are only shades of gray. Black and white are nothing more than lofty ideals in our minds, the standards by which we try to judge things, and map out our place in the world in relevance to them.\" So, she'll eat whatever she has to, she'll hang up with whoever she has to and she will accept whatever the night brings because she's changed too. __________________________ First read: October 2013 4 *freaking solid* stars It's our action that defines us. What we choose. What we resist. What we're willing to die for. I think I could describe Bloodfever as intense, fearless, brilliant, addictive, unputdownable and even then you wouldn't know how awesome this book is. The writing is addictive. Karen Marie Moning is a genius. The plot is there, I know it is, there must be... but here's the crazy thing: I have no fucking idea what the hell is going on and I don't feel betrayed at all, actually I'm so into this. I mean, she managed to capture my attention from chapter one and I just couldn't stop reading it. The best part? I'm satisfied. No complains about the lack of answers at all. The characters are incredibly complex and their development is amazing. Mac, once spoiled and annoying, is a total badass, funny, witty, flawed, resolved and so realistic I had to check twice if this was indeed UF material. Barrons is everything I want you'd ever wanted in a man if you liked incredibly strong, frustratingly enigmatic, impossible and dominating men. God, I do have issues... And this: \"Yes, I have loved, Ms. Lane, and although it\u2018s none of your business, I have lost. Many things. And no, I am not like any other player in this game and I will never be like V\u2018lane, and I get a hard-on a great deal more often than occasionally.\" He leaned fully against me and I gasped. \"Sometimes it\u2018s over a spoiled little girl, not a woman at all.\u201d Yes, the emotional and intense Jericho moment when you just know there's no hope for you. I'm fascinated by Fever. \u201cThe wisest man is the silent one. Examine his actions. Judge him by them.\u201d Oh, I'm judging you, Barrons... and I have some crazy theories about what you are, you sexy bastard. ...more Third Read - October 2015: 5 stars!!!

How did I ever give this anything less than 5 stars?!?!?! This book is amazingly strong on world-building and we get our first glimpse of several future KEY players, like Dani, Christian, Ryodan, Rowena... I found the scenes with Barrons so much more poignant and \"full of feels.\" KMM did some amazing writing and story-telling here. I still remain SUCH a fangirl for this series. For me, it holds up 100%. Original second re-read thoughts: I kept my original rating. BARRONS. In this re-read, I found myself just waiting for the Barrons sections to come up. Never enough Barrons. This book introduced some great new characters and expanded some characters that were barely introduced in Darkfever . There was more world-building in this one than action. It wasn't until the last 30% of the book or so before it became a page-turner. But I still loved reading about the world KMM has created. A lot of interesting things happen in this, lots of little things, that will prove to all add up as the books go on. (view spoiler) [ I love that Barrons tattooed Mac anyway because she should have let him and he proved that he knows what he's talking about. Loved the almost-sex scene in the Burren. Y-u-m. I totally forgot the reaper/specter Mac kept seeing was Malluce! So it was like reading it for the first time. I think he made a good villain. (hide spoiler) ] Mac still clings to her old life and mindset a few times, but she learns fast. It's only been a few months and she becomes a bad-ass in this one. It's funny to read my original review because it looks like I was already having Barrons-angst because I thought he wasn't in it enough. (Mac meets and has interactions with several -some of them new- characters. Like I said above, there are a lot of conversations and inner monologues in this one.) Original review: Another great addition to the Fever series. I liked this one better than the first and there was a lot of action and wonderful world-building. I do hope Barrons doesn't stay the same enigmatic character for every book. He dashes in, helps Mac, they have sexually-charged banter, and he disappears again. I can already feel that would get old if it remains that way book to book.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more Things are heating up for the Fever series!

It's a strange new world out there and the rules have changed: It's every princess for herself. Ive discovered why I've been sucked into this series. I can't predict or classify the characters. In a world where literary characters are painfully formulaic, Karen Marie Moning is blazing her own wild road with this series and I'm just happy to be taken along for the ride. I read this entire book cover-to-cover in a single day... I STILL have questions. I'm making predictions about characters and wondering about outcomes... The reader can never really be sure who is a \"good guy\" and who is a \"bad guy\" in this urban fantasy adventure on the dark streets of Dublin. I'm beginning to think that no character is exclusively \"good\" or \"bad\" - I'm starting to believe that everyone's motives exist in a shade of grey. MAC I would wear pink because I knew my future was anything but rosy. I would accessorize myself to the hilt, and I would wear flirty shoes because my world needed more beauty to counter all the ugliness in it. I would wear pink because I hated gray, I didn\u2019t deserve white, and I was sick of black. Mac is beginning to undergo a through mental and physical transformation. On the physical side, she's turned into black-ops Barbie by her handler. It seems everyone wants Mac on their side, but she's learning her lesson about attracting attention... She's learning that she can't trust anybody, but she must attempt to gain information from any source possible. She's developing a set of wonderfully lethal skills and a hard shell. BARRONS Barrons has something the rest of us don't have. I don't know what it is, but I feel it all the time, especially when we're standing close. Beneath the expensive clothes, unplaceable accent, and cultured veneer, there's something that never crawled all the way out of the swamp. It didn't want to. It likes it there. I have my predictions about who and what I think Barrons is, but I won't post them here because I don't want any of you lovely readers to confirm or deny my suspicions. I'd like for the reveal of Barrons to play out naturally as the author intended. Barrons remains secrative, dark, and absurdly sexy... But he's damn fascinating! I'm way more interested in unraveling the mystery of Jericho Barrons than I am about anything else in this series... That's saying an awful lot, because this book ramped up everything: More interesting secondary-characters More weird monsters roaming the streets More Action and suspense More blood and gore More sexytimes... But get this: NOBODY HAS HAD SEX IN THIS SERIES YET! I can't call it Erotica... I can't call it a romance... This is simply one of a kind... Unfortunately, I'll have to pause for a bit before reading the rest of the series.

This is SO much better than the first book. Actually I could easily downgrade Darkfever to a 2.5 rating after reading Bloodfever. But I'm not *that* bad so I'll just leave my rating as it is:) So that's basically me while reading the book: \"Bloody hell! Holy crap! You have to be kidding me! Well hello again you death-by-sex Fae, mind if I take my bra off? What the f**ck just happened?! Go girl, you show him! Arrrrggggh! Oh, swooning a bit right there! Well that was unexpected! Barrons, you aggravating, infuriating, exasperating, sneaky bastard! Oh no you don't! No more pink bullshit, yay! Hey Barrons, if you really want to tattoo someone I'm right here *waves frantically at Kindle screen*! Oooooh that was pretty disgusting, I love it! Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh wow. Freaking wow! Hallelujah! Yes yes yes!\" You get my drift. Yes, Bloodfever was a pretty awesome read. A fast-paced, intense, emotional, exciting as hell roller-coaster ride. What impressed me most here was Moning's writing. It was alright in Darkfever but she really has outdone herself here. Moning has a strange yet brilliant way of giving the reader glimpses of events that have just happened behind the scenes that leaves you thinking: \"Wait, did I just skip a page or something?\" The details seem to appear magically a few paragraphs or pages later, blending effortlessly into the story. It's hard to explain really but it's one fantastic writing trick . That a story told in such a way would be understandable at all is amazing. Well, to be honest, I was a bit clueless most of the time but that's only because Moning loves to tease her readers to death, planting more questions in their little heads than she's giving them answers for. Brilliant writing I tell you! Talking about the plot is nearly impossible here. Too many things happening, too many twists and revelations, too much information. It's just one (choose all that apply) jaw-dropping/amazing/emotional/funny/crazy/infuriating/fascinating scene after another. Want to know my favourite ones? Of course you do! Here goes: Mac & V'Lane at BBB (their conversation is funny as hell and what can I say? I can't resist the guy.), (view spoiler) [Fiona being a total bitch: this series really needed a bitch from hell ! (hide spoiler) ] , Mac's dad visiting, (view spoiler) [Dani telling Mac that there are no male sidhe-seers (hide spoiler) ] , silent conversations (love 'em!), the auction scene, (view spoiler) [Mac finding out that Barrons was her sister's landlord (hide spoiler) ] , Mac's involuntary beach holiday and her return to a very pissed off Barrons (that'll teach him!), the tattoo scene (hello! Still volunteering here Barrons!), the freaking Burren scene from beginning to end\u2026 and its aftermath! Okay okay you win, I'll stop right there. I have to say that one aspect of the plot disappointed me. It's hard to talk about it without revealing anything so I guess it's spoiler time. (view spoiler) [Grim reaper=Malluc\u00e9=culprit. That felt like a cheap trick to me. I expected something bigger and darker to be revealed and the fact that it was \"only\" Malluc\u00e9 felt like a let-down. I was never really impressed by Malluc\u00e9. As far as bad guys go he's a bit on the light side and the supposed vampire act never added anything to the plot. Don't get me wrong, I love the scenes in the Burren. They are amazing and probably the best scenes in the series so far. Still, the fact that Malluc\u00e9 was the bad guy felt a bit anticlimactic to me. (hide spoiler) ] Oh wait, I just thought of something else that was a bit disappointing. Sorry, spoiler time again! (view spoiler) [I think it's a shame that Mac didn't stay part-Fae , it would have been such a fantastic twist to the story! Too bad Moning didn't go with it. (hide spoiler) ] Now let's talk about Rainbow Girl for a second here. Mac, Mac, Mac. We weren't on the best of terms at first. How was I supposed to believe that a superficial, Barbie-looking, silly girl would turn into one of the most awesome butt kicking heroines out there? I can't say she is a total badass yet but we're slowly getting there. She's grown a lot since the first instalment and she's lost most of her air-headed attitude which is a huge relief. I still think that Moning overdid it with the Pinky Rainbows act in Bloodfever. I have no problem with a na\u00efve, inexperienced heroine but there was no need to re-hash it all the way she did by adding layer upon layer of superficial silliness . Mac certainly seems to be getting her act together towards the end of the book and she finally holds her own against Barrons and the rest of the clique. So. Mr Barrons. Here we are. After reading the first instalment I obviously thought you were an aggravating bastard. Because, you know, you are one. Anyway, my freaky BR friends had warned me that I would fall under your exasperating-yet-irresistible spell by the end of book 2. Although I have not yet fallen entirely victim to your \"I'm hot, sexy and infuriating\" act I have to admit I liked the swoon-worthy potential I had a glimpse of here (view spoiler) [tattoo scene + lusty Burren = yum (hide spoiler) ] It seems some readers want romance to blossom between Mac & Barrons. You know what? Romance is terribly overrated. Just give me the lust and I'll be the happiest of girls! As to what Barrons may or may not be: I don't really have a clue here except that silly little me had the very fine idea to read the Burned blurb the other day. Now I know one of Barrons' dirty little secrets. Clever. Very very clever of me\u2026 All in all this was a pretty awesome read. What made it even more fantastic? My MacHalo gang of course!

Why didn\u2019t I read this before?! Anyway, better late than never, right? Well, like the first book, Darkfever , Bloodfever is also fast-paced and superbly written. I am totally in love with Moning \u2019s writing. It has a way of capturing your attention for ridiculous amounts of time. That's even more impressive when it comes to me, personally, since I have the attention span of ant. So, what is this book about? It picks up right where the previous one ended. Mac and Barrons are still on their quest to find the Sinsar Dubh and her sister's murderer. I like how Moning added depth to the paranormal world and also to the characters here. I felt the first book was much more about acclimating the readers to the main characters, their background, the essencial environments around them, the main creatures which surround them more frequently; a great amount of page time was spent getting Mac to understand what it meant having the powers that she has, which is perfectly normal, really. Most of longish series like this spend the first installment as some kind of bestiary/fictional geographic guide with a little plot to keep things interesting. I'm not saying that there were no more surprising new stuff in Bloodfever. I'm just saying that there were much more plot and character development and I was glad. There were some new amazing secondary characters too. Some of them good, some of them bad. Malluc\u00e9 is the one that impressed me the most , though. I think Moning used him as some kind of metaphor about where greed can lead you. Either way, he was creepy and gave me the chills. However, what happens to him, despite warranted, made me feel bad. No one deserves that, even if they do. Does that make any sense? Anyway, I feel like the episode concerning Malluc\u00e9 was like a milestone. Up until his comeuppance, most of the story, as told under Mac's point of view, was a little too rainbows and unicorns for it too be taken seriously as a dark paranormal romance. Malluc\u00e9 brought about some really needed darkness that gave the story some edge and also made Mac become way less naive and way more aware about the gravity of the situation she was in. Ah! I almost forgot. Finally we get some physical action between Barrons and Mac and I absolutely loved it. Yes, it was quick, kinda bloody and sad. But it was also intense and was revealing enough about Barrons' feelings about her. I understand that there are many more books to come, so their relationship doesn't have to develop super fast to full on sex, so I was content enough with what was given by the author in Bloodfever . There is little to no actual romance, but it is made up for a lot by the constant sexual tension. And man, if there is someone who can give you sexual tension like a pro, it's Moning . I don't want to say anything else so as not to spoil anything for those of you reading this that have not read the book yet, so I'll stop. All that's left to say i that this is an amazing book which is only not getting a full five star rating from me due to very personal reasons. I'm glad it had almost everything I was expecting, though: suspense, passion, revenge, anguish, sexual tension, intensity, good monologues, insights and dialogues, amazing character development. I totally recommend this series! If you haven't started it yet, go on and do it. Bye. ...more 4 What-the-BLOODY-Hell Stars \"It\u2019s our actions that define us. What we choose. What we resist.

Yours sincerely, Jo. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear V\u2019 m lane, I have a month to spare. I\u2019ll see if I can get a cheap flight to Faery. Although the only time I attempted to play volleyball resulted in a nosebleed. Maybe we could play boules? OR that Velcro tennis kind of thing that probably has a name but I don\u2019t know what it is. Also, we need to get you kitted out in some kind of fae speedos because robes aren\u2019t really beach attire, are they? Although I guess you have been living in Dublin and the sea is probably a bit nippy all year round. I\u2019ll get back to you on that. Best wishes, Jo. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Barrons vs V\u2019 m lane (Round #2) Barrons (view spoiler) [I thought Barrons would have this in the bag but just because a girl develops a taste for Rhino-corpse meat does not mean it is OK to punch her. Even if she\u2019s flying high as a kite. Sure you gave her a smokin\u2019 kiss which was extremely intriguing because of the wind and the desert and angst but\u2026.. eh. Not cool, Barrons. Not cool. (hide spoiler) ] But your torso is covered in tattoos. Also, you still look like this. So again\u2026 ijowqlKAJSDHEUIW29OP;L.,,mmazxsdwjk1aa! V\u2019 m lane.

You didn\u2019t punch our heroine in the face: Again, a plus. You took her to a beach and let her see her sister: Lovely. You were a bit sneaky in keeping her for a month and you made Barrons get all sexyangry: Funny. But then you just let our heroine get stolen by a vampire and punched by a werewolf , shape-shifter , FAE?!?! brooding man: Not so good. (hide spoiler) ] Also, you still look like this.

This second installment was Much better than the first. It has lots of action and with all the mayhem it gets pretty hard to put down. The mystery, though, is still there picking away at my brain cells. We got no real answers in this one, especially from Barrons. Only more questions. Which ended up being ok because the book is fully loaded and it couldn't possibly all fit in here. Plus the anticipation is kind of fun.

It has lots of action and with all the mayhem it gets pretty hard to put down. The mystery, though, is still there picking away at my brain cells. We got no real answers in this one, especially from Barrons. Only more questions. Which ended up being ok because the book is fully loaded and it couldn't possibly all fit in here. Plus the anticipation is kind of fun. Mac is becoming more independent and grown up which is great. I think she kind of has to with this new world she's been thrown in. I like how she herself knows there are \"two\" Macs and she refers to them both. She acknowledges that her Barbie doll side does not mix well with the Unseelie and especially not Barrons. And talking about the devil\u2026 what can I say Barrons? I love you! You are probably the most antagonizing son of a bitch I have ever encountered. There are so many questions about this guy that it's almost a torture. Damn you Karen! There are also new characters added to the storyline - but who cares about them? Moving on.. Like any other UF novel, there are a few twists, and most of them just add to the questions already in the air. I didn't see them coming either. Although who/what the spectre was did cross my mind, but even the small stuff all went over my head. It may just be because I was too busy inside the story to ponder anything. But I never figured out what was eating the Rhino-boys, or Malluc\u00e9's power source. Even though we aren't given answers to any of the big mysteries, we do find out little snippets. Just enough to keep us fed and craving for more. I did enjoy the plot quite a bit. I like lots of action, I like mystery and I love a well built world; believe me, this novel delivers. The world building was formed in the first book, but it's deepened and I enjoy the vivid descriptions of everything. It's all very nerve wracking. There is quite a bit of gore but there is also humor thrown in there to balance it out a bit. I especially liked when the Shade flipped Mac off. >.< So all in all the writing is pretty good, I would even say improved from book #1. I think the constant and sometimes weird metaphors could be cut out. But that and maybe a few little quirks here and there can be overlooked if you even notice at all. ...more Rereading with my buddies, edgy and sleepless. Bring on the Barrons!!

New thoughts after reread: I was actually thinking that Mac was growing a bit in this story, and I was really proud of her for standing up to the Mob-guy... until she utters this ridiculousness: \"Go ahead, O'Bannion, come and get it. I'm fed up with jack-petunias like you.\" Original review from 2014: So, in Georgia they call the hot lava game \"don't touch the alligator\"? That's just weird! Everyone knows that when you are kids, you pretend the floor is covered in HOT LAVA, and that is why you jump from beds to dressers to couches to tables, etc... There was even an epic episode of Community where Abed and Troy start a giant hot lava game at the school for Troy's last day. It was dean-tastic! But, it figures that Mac would have a stupid name for the game. She can't even swear like a normal person. Idiot! The action in this book does get better than the last and the dark characters are really interesting. I like the complexity of the story, and how it keeps growing as time goes on. Nothing ends too quickly or neatly, which is nice. And, Mac has gotten a tiny bit smarter, more so in the beginning of the book, but she has a long way to go to get to your average person's start point. It seems pretty obvious, though, that Mac is still making way too many stupid assumptions. And, her stubbornness combined with her stupidly false bravado is going to keep getting her almost killed and waiting for Jericho to save her every book. ...more Plot: 5 stars Characters: 5 stars Writing: 5 stars Sexiness: 5 stars Ending: 5 stars Overall: 5 stars 4 HOOKED-BUT-STILL-FECKING-CONFUSED STARS!!!!!

Question: When you're one of the few people who can do something to fix a problem, just how responsible does that make you for it? Answer: It's how you choose to answer that question that defines you. I really can't understand why I only gave this book 4 stars the last time that I read it. Basically, I think that any book that I feel compelled to read not once, not twice but 3 times (so far) has to deserve 5 stars...it just has to be that way. I first came across this book at a yard sale along with two other books in the series. I paid 25\u00a2 for it and still feel so lucky that I literally stumbled upon them. This series is an excellent example of why I am a reader. This world is real to be. I daydream about Barrons. When I hear songs mentioned in these books, I think about what was happening in the plot at the time. It really does not get much better than this. I'd like to tell you that the monster under the bed is rarely as bad as you fear of it, but in my experience it's almost always worse. Things get even a bit crazier in this book. Mac has had a lot to deal with in such a very short time. She is dealing better with everything she has found out about who and what she is in this installment in the series. She is smart and takes advice when she believes it will help her and really wants to learn. The monsters in this book get scarier and by the end of this book, she encounters some things that are completely frightening but she never gives up. \"What are you, Barrons?\" \"The one who will never let you die, and that's more, Ms. Lane, than anyone in your life has ever been able to say to you. More than anyone else can do.\" I cannot think of a character in a book that I like more than Barrons. He can be an ass and we really don't know that much about who or what he really is but he is the most appealing man that I have ever encountered on the page of a book. When things need to be done, Barrons is there to do them and he always seems to be in control. He is able to save the day even when things look hopeless. He says things that make me laugh, make me think, and sometimes make me want to think mushy thoughts. Barrons is reason enough to read this series. \"One day you may kiss a man you can't breathe without, and find breath is of little consequence.\" This book has some of the best lines. If you took some of these lines and shared them with others, they would never believe that it comes from a story like this. It's a different kind of book and makes you think at times. I think everyone should read this series. It is really that good. If you haven't read it yet, I urge you to pick up the first book in the series and get started right away. ...more It\u2019s a little hard for me to write a review for Bloodfever, because I finished it and immediately started the audio of Faefever.

I think I might confuse some of both books together if I try to summarize it for anyone. Suffice it to say that I\u2019m hooked! In Darkfever, Mac was a spoiled, na\u00efve, and innocent young woman out to find her sister, Alina\u2019s murderer. In Bloodfever, Mac has grown up a bit, whether she wanted to or not. She\u2019s still the old-fashioned southern, pink, and sparkle clad woman when she can be, but she\u2019s no longer as innocent as she was. Mac: \u201cI would wear pink because I knew my future was anything but rosy. I would accessorize myself to the hilt, and I would wear flirty shoes because my world needed more beauty to counter all the ugliness in it. I would wear pink because I hated gray, I didn\u2019t deserve white, and I was sick of black.\u201d Bloodfever follows Mac in her quest to find the Unseelie book, the Sinsar Dubh, her dying sister\u2019s last wish, with Barrons. She still has no idea what Barrons motives are in finding the ancient and powerful book, but at the moment he\u2019s been the most helpful of all the big players, saving her life a couple of times. She still keeps V\u2019lane in her back pocket, but at arms length because he\u2019s a death-by-sex Fae prince (not a horrible way to go, IMO, but still), and she\u2019s not about to trust him fully. I, like Mac wouldn\u2019t trust Rowena any farther than I could throw that old witch! She\u2019s left her high and dry too many times for my liking! I like the direction Mac and Barron\u2019s relationship is taking, and whether they admit it to each other or themselves, you can tell they\u2019re beginning to matter to one another. Love this quote because it\u2019s so no-nonsense and oh-so-Barrons: \u201cWhat are you Barrons?\u201d \u201cThe one who will never let you die, and that\u2019s more, Ms. Lane, than anyone in your life has been able to say to you. More than anyone else can do.\u201d This is like a love letter from Barrons. He may not utter words of endearment to Mac, but you can tell she\u2019s burrowed a way into his heart. I just know it. Mac goes through a lot in this installment. Thankfully it\u2019s not detailed bit by bit, because I can\u2019t take that sort of thing. At the end of Bloodfever there\u2019s a lot of unanswered questions but I was able to pop in the next book, Faefever, right after finishing, so I\u2019m not going to complain! I have to say, when I first started listening to this audio I wasn\u2019t pleased that it was a woman narrating every voice, even Barrons, but now that I\u2019ve been listening to it, I don\u2019t mind. I love the southern voice for Mac, it\u2019s pitch perfect. Faefever is the same narrator, Joyce Bean, and I love it already. I\u2019m curious how the last two are going to sound. There is a switch to a male and female narrator and I\u2019m excited! I\u2019ve heard only good things about the male narrator. Can\u2019t wait! I've been listening to the audio CD's to and from work. Finally, my commute time doesn't seem like such a waste.
