Going to college in the fall of 1983 I had probably only heard of The Sex Pistols, though I had never listened to them. Then when I got to college I was immersed in it, without my choosing to be. I loved some of it but just never pursued it as an interest or as a lifestyle, it was just the soundtrack to my experiences.

But what a great album! and I would say about it what I would say about other Punk I've gotten into since - such as Television and The Minutemen - that it is nothing other than simply great Rock & Roll. So I grew curious about Patti Smith and then this book came out and I snatched it up. It's a sweet and gritty account of her growing into maturity and how it coincided with her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe. There's a wise naturalness in how she grew into the woman we now know. There was ambition, but only on her own terms, and there was no striving to be part of a scene outside of herself (& Robert), though she ended up in one fascinating scene after another as the grimy and vibrant New York art/bohemian landscape tumultuously morphed into the previously unknown seemingly by the hour in the late 1960's and early 1970's. She portrays these scenes as the outsider she always felt she was, yet they're portrayed head-on, not through a scrim of self-consciousness or psychic distance: she was in the thick of it, even acting as a nurturing figure to many, yet she was also strangely apart from it. Throughout there's a focus on her intimate relationships and how their effects radiated out into the situations she was involved in, which gives the feeling of a real groundedness regardless of how crazy things were. But whoever she was with - Jim Carroll, Sam Shepard, a guy from Blue Oyster Cult - Mapplethorpe sill permeated her consciousness. In many ways they were alike, but in even more important ways they were very different, and part of the fascination of this book is pondering the duality they set up - Robert alienated from his family and erasing his past to find the future while Patti was always firmly bedded in her past and in her family, Robert's wild drug use and Patti's basically straight life, Patti's Victorian sloppiness and Robert's decadent minimalism, and of course the sexual complications. This book is not only entertaining but lovely and wise too. ...more \u266a Stayin\u2019 up for days in the Chelsea Hotel... \u266b <+++>Just Kids</+++> makes me feel so damn left out.

Ultimately, the book is a love story, only the love extended over a long period, and sometimes it was requited, sometimes not. Just Kidding Lots of things got in the way, sexuality for starters, drugs for main course, other partners for dessert. But the book is about a love that they shared, and a youth that they both retained the whole of their lives, no matter what happened on the inside or the outside and no matter how poor or successful they were. The name of the book asserts her belief that all that time they really were \"just kids\", those two kids that the tourists photographed soon after they first met. About Another Boy Although Patti reveals a lot about Robert, I think ultimately the book is her final expression of love for him. I think it's important that she express her sugary side anyway, rather than \"hide your love away\". The book might be relatively sugar-coated for our image of Patti Smith, but her sugar isn't as sickly sweet as most sleb love stories. Memento Mori (Postscript) One of the reasons I empathise with this book so much is my passion for Robert Mapplethorpe's photography (not to mention Patti's music, lyrics and poetry). In March - April, 1986, I was on the Board of the Institute of Modern Art in Brisbane, at the time we helped to bring an exhibition of Robert's photos to Australia. It was a time of great political and moral conservatism in Queensland. The Board included artists and academics who feared the loss of their jobs, if they were involved in the exhibition of photography that might later be found to be obscene under our criminal laws. Many Board Meetings in the lead up to the exhibition debated whether we should not proceed with the exhibition or remove particular images (including \"Man in Polyester Suit\"). I made some tentative preparations to deal with a potential criminal action against the Board Members, including getting expert evidence on Robert's artistic status. In the end, we decided to proceed with the exhibition in an uncensored form. All images were displayed in the form submitted by the artist and the curator. The exhibition was highly popular and no complaints were made to the Police. No criminal prosecution occurred. The important lesson is that we could have self-censored and lost our own freedom. Instead, we asserted and preserved our freedom in the face of fear. For me, Robert and Patti represent, not just the existence of freedom in the abstract, but the assertion of freedom in reality. They more than earned the right to their love. \"Your ancestors salute you.\" ...more There are some moments of real poignancy here and some very deft turns of phrase, but I was also just bored stiff for most of it.

How and why did she stick with him -- as a lover -- through his gay hustling? What did she feel about this? She is by turns squeamish about his homosexuality and also fully accepting of everything he does. There's nothing inherently wrong with either reaction but I'd like to hear a little more about them. Bottom line: had this not been Patti Smith writing about Robert Mapplethorpe, and had I not been in a book group where we were discussing the book, I wouldn't have kept reading past the 50th page. ...more This book will be added to \"The Art Spirit\" as an essential volume on my writer's \"behind the desk\" bookshelf, the story of two baby artists and how they grew.

It's an opportunity to walk a mile in Patti Smith's head, in a less coded and more factual way than in her music or poetry, but no less poetic for having been a lived life. Patti Smith has always been my idea of an artist--that an artist is different from an intellectual. The artist's way of being in the world is not about mincing and dicing experience, but about allowing oneself to resonate with events, to be played by the texture of life, and seeing what one is naturally drawn to, and how that stimulates an artistic reaction. Her way and his way. I like the unselfconsciousness of this writing--in an odd way, unself-examining, a paradox in a memoir. I have read the Patricia Morrisroe bio of Mapplethorpe--admittedly for the Patti Smith/Mapplethorpe material--and it's a revelation to read Patti's take on that time versus the reportage of people who had known them at the time. I love the layering of experience that way, as anyone who's read my work will know--the difference between the lived life and the way it looks from the outside. If it were someone else, I would even question the simplicity of the tale-tellling, the innocence portrayed, say, if it were Dylan or other more manipulative figures--but having listened to Patti Smith for 25 years, I believe this awkward innocent visionary quality. This is what we need, what I need, in our pathetic, overfacebooked, overstudied 2010s. More living, more art, more innocence, more faith, more poetry, more friendship, more acceptance. *********************************** ...more Hi Ho, the artistic life.

I had very divergent feelings about Just Kids , Patti Smith's National-Book-Award-winning memoir about her friendship with Robert Mapplethorpe. There were times that I felt moved by the beauty of her writing, and others in which I found her to be nothing more than another spoiled, entitled kid who got where she got to, talented or not, because of connections. It is not that Smith arrived in NYC with a list of names and numbers. But she did have the good fortune to encounter a knight in shining armor who had a prodigous artistic drive and the good looks to attract a series of male gateways to the New York arts scene. There is no doubt about the deep connection Smith formed with Robert Mapplethorpe, famed photographer to-be. They were not only lovers, but bffs. And that continued long after they stopped sharing a bed. Smith takes us on a journey through the gritty and some not-so-gritty portions of the New York arts scene, offering glimpses of the many, many people she and Mapplethorpe met. It is a veritable who's who, including bits and pieces on Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Sam Shepherd, Andy Warhol, Wiliam Burroughs, and a cast of hundreds. I never got the impression that Smith was name-dropping. She was as amazed as any aspiring artist might be at finding herself among so many notables. One downside to this is that so many shining lights speed by like houses at night as seen from a train. I would have liked it had she gone into a little (or a lot) more detail on more of these luminaries. She certainly does reinforce the image of the Chelsea Hotel as a cauldron of creativity in its day. The story of her arrival in New York, meeting Mapplethorpe and struggling to get by is worth the price of admission, a real look at what it means to be a starving artist. And that is not just a glib turn-of-phrase, as Patti, at times, made use of the five-finger discount in order to eat. It is also fun to read about how she and Robert trolled discount stores for materials they would use to make jewelry or incorporate into other artistic projects. Despite the minimal physical mileage traversed here, Just Kids is a bit of a road story. Instead of crossing continents, she and Mapplethorpe cross from obscurity to fame, from outsiders to insiders, from fellow travellers (in a very non-political sense) to lovers to soulmates I was surprised at a few things. Ok, look at almost any photo of Patti Smith and tell me with a straight face that she doesn't make you think of the Calvin Klein ideal of physical appearance. Yet, when she appeared in a play as a person with drug issues she was completely uncomfortable pretending to shoot up. Even her director was shocked at her lack of hard drug experience. A little weed here and there does not give one that lovely Ginger Baker look. A diet sprinkled with stolen food contributed for sure, but nature sculpted that body, not dark substances. I was also surprised--having come to the book with no familiarity with Smith beyond her recording of \u201cBecause the Night\u201d--about the diversity of her artistry, running from drawing to poetry, to playwrighting, to acting, and so on. I have read better memoirs, and I do not think this should have won the National Book Award. But there is no missing the real feeling she communicates, the love she and Mapplethorpe had for each other. Her writing is good, sometimes better than good, and you will not be disappointed. But for many, the lifestyles presented here might be discomfiting, the willingness to engage in hustling, thievery, and very open relationships make the artistic world Smith and Mapplethorpe inhabited a decidedly acquired taste. ...more This book is remarkably easy to parody. Here, I'll try: \"I was crossing Tompkins Square Park when I ran into a young man wearing a gabardine vest. He smiled at me and called me \"Sister.\" It was a young George Carlin.

Robert hated him because he frequently had flakes of rye bread in his beard, but I loved how he could make me laugh with his impressions of Mick Jagger. On this morning, though, we wept together at the news that Paul McCartney would have to sell his house in Cannes. It was a sort of paradise for us, even though we'd never been. George gave me a feather to put in my hair, and I took it home and pressed it between two pieces of crepe de chine, where it left a ghostly impression. Robert insisted on using it in a construction, and finally I relented, though I knew I'd never get it back. It was a sacrifice to art, the sort of thing Rimbaud would've done.\" I think this parodic potential arises from the book's total and complete lack of irony. This is the most earnest, sincere book I've read in a long time, and that's what makes it so heartbreaking. Smith begins the book with an abundance of naivete, and in many ways, she never loses the idealism with which she begins her career. Written in a lyrical, elegiac tone, this is, at its heart, a book about the bond two artists develop. There's a remarkable amount of honest in the pages, and Smith's and Mapplethorpe's friendship is unique. They were lovers, collaborators, confidants, rivals...Their lives were the stuff of legend, and this book is a valiant effort to put that legend on the page. If you've ever held the romantic \"starving artist\" cliche in esteem, this is the book for you. Smith spends paragraphs talking about how hungry she was when she first moved to New York, and she isn't using the word as a euphemism for ambition -- she really needed to eat. Upon her return from a season in Paris, Mapplethorpe greets her in a feverish state, suffering from abscessed wisdom teeth and gonorrhea. And yet! They lived the lives of artists, staying up into the wee hours creating, writing, singing. They knew everyone. Harry Smith, Allen Ginsburg, Sam Shepard, Jim Carroll, Todd Rundgren, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin -- they all passed through Smith's life, and they all make memorable appearances in the book. It's a name-dropper's paradise, and yet, I didn't come away from the book feeling as though Smith was boasting or exaggerating her own life. I'm sure she's omitted some unfortunate moments on her rise to the top, but she seems honest about her own shortcomings (She freely admits that she acted like a jerk after her first big poetry reading, for instance). I knew nothing of Robert Mapplethorpe beyond his work and the controversy it had caused in the late 80s (I was too young to understand much of what he was trying to say, though I could understand the controversy just fine). The portrait Smith paints of Mapplethorpe is one of a passionate, wildly creative artist, and also of a man driven by his ambition to become famous. Her friendship with him was clearly the defining moment of her life, and reading about it was a pleasure. I often felt lost in this book, and I suspect that that's the only way to read it -- to just plow through it. I don't think I share all of Smith's ideas about art, but I respect her passion and her talent as a writer. Her prose is clear and direct and eminently readable. And maybe best of all, wherever I took this book, people would comment on it. \"I just finished it. It's heartbreaking.\" Or \"I wish I had her passion.\" I love when I read a book that inspires that kind of connection between people. It makes me feel, even if only for a moment, that I live in the kind of world that Patti Smith lives in. ...more I loved this book. I did not want it to end.

Just Kids tells the story of Patti growing up and following her desires to go to NYC and grow and become an artist. She tells of the wonderful life-long friendship that she had with the photographer, Robert Mapplethorpe. I had no idea how talented Patti Smith is - she's a poet, artist, writer, musician, singer, actress. She has been in photos, acted in plays, wrote lots of songs, wrote books on poetry and non-fiction. She came into contact with so many different types of artists that helped her grow - various notable musicians, poets, artists. There were a lot of famous people mentioned but these are the people that were in NYC during this time when it was on the cusp of art and artists coming alive. She talks of her time spent in the Chelsea Hotel in NYC which, at the time, was a haven for artistic folks. But out of all those mentioned, it was Mapplethorpe who pushed her and helped her find her artistic abilities and find out who she was/is. It's amazing that these two found one another and pushed each other. It's a beautiful story. I saw Patti Smith speak recently and she said that Mapplethorpe, before he died, asked her to tell their story. Just Kids is that story and a story that took her 20 years to write. I know why this book won the National Book Award and why it's #4 on the 100 best music books of all time. It reads like poetry.

I went to France and visited Rimbaud's grave and wore my raincoat for it was raining. Robert was a genius and we lay upon a mattress. One time I met Jimi Hendrix. Then he died.

Thompson, and when she walks through a New York crowd she sees, like Pynchon or a grungy Walt Whitman, \u2018Boys on shore leave, prostitutes, runaways, abused tourists, and assorted victims of alien abduction\u2019. Her writing is deadpan and matter-of-fact; reading this book is like talking to some hoarse, hungover stranger in the kitchen after an all-weekend party, someone in an oversized T-shirt chain-drinking coffees, exhausted but full of mysteries to relate. She never overdoes it, but the easy colloquiality of her tone disguises a faultless understanding of where the focus of her memoir should lie \u2013 when to skip through several years within a paragraph, and when to lavish pages on a single mesmeric afternoon. The time and place she is dealing with have passed into legend, and fortunately she is not averse to the pleasures of namedropping: At the table to my left, Janis Joplin was holding court with her band. To my far right were Grace Slick and the Jefferson Airplane, along with members of Country Joe and the Fish. At the last table facing the door was Jimi Hendrix, his head lowered, eating with his hat on, across from a blonde. Just another day at the Chelsea Hotel, circa 1969\u2026. It must be tempting to overplay your involvement in things if you were around then, but Smith is all cool circumspection; \u2018I was there for these moments,\u2019 she allows, \u2018but so young and preoccupied with my own thoughts that I hardly recognized them as moments.\u2019 Instead, all her attention was given over to the one man who seemed to have dominated her emotional life and her artistic development, Robert Mapplethorpe. I didn't know Mapplethorpe's work very well, associating him mainly with the all the controversial 1980s black nudes, and it was strange encountering him through Patti Smith \u2013 he seems so unlike his image that for a while I was convinced I'd confused the name with someone else. Her descriptions of their often-grim early days together are among her most evocative passages, and show off her direct sense of atmosphere to good effect. It was a terrible place, dark and neglected, with dusty windows that overlooked the noisy street. [\u2026] I sat there watching him sweat and shiver on an iron bed. The springs of the ancient mattress poked through the stained sheet. The place reeked of piss and exterminator fluid, the wallpaper peeling like dead skin in summer. There was no running water in the corroded sink, only occasional rusted droplets plopping through the night. Despite his illness, he wanted to make love, and perhaps our union was some comfort, for it drew out his sweat\u2026 I have to admit, I felt a little churlish about her obsession with him at the beginning of the book, having chiefly wanted a memoir of Patti Smith and not of Robert Mapplethorpe. But that feels very ungracious as the book goes on and she convinces you of his importance to her. What exactly drew them to each other is never made completely clear; a mixture of desire and support and artistic inspiration, but one that caused them both a lot of pain as Mapplethorpe started to explore his interest in men and in New York's S&M scene. Smith describes the two of them, in one of her many astute references to French literature, as being \u2018irrevocably entwined, like Paul and Elisabeth, the sister and brother in Cocteau's Les Enfants Terribles \u2019. I was charmed by the sartorial nature of Smith's memory. Almost every scene is introduced by way of a run-down of what she was wearing at the time, and the details of her outfit are often much more vivid than any of the conversations; this is not reeled off in a label-conscious fashionista way, it's just clearly the way she sees the world. \u2018I don't remember what I read,\u2019 she says of one of the early poetry readings that would lead to her rock career, \u2018but I remember what Robert wore\u2026.\u2019 Sometimes whole anecdotes are built on this clothing recall: when at a party the designer Fernando S\u00e1nchez questions her choice of white sneakers with black jacket, black tie, black silk shirt, and \u2018heavily pegged black satin pants\u2019, she tells him she's in costume as a tennis player in mourning. And when she auditions guitarist Tom Verlaine, she almost treats it more as a test of wardrobe than of musical compatibility: Divining how to appeal to Tom's sensibilities, I dressed in a manner that I thought a boy from Delaware would understand: black ballet flats, pink shantung capris, my kelly green silk raincoat, and a violet parasol\u2026 Oh for a photograph. Patti Smith is \u2013 there's no getting away from the word \u2013 incredibly cool. While at the Chelsea Hotel, she talks about her fascination with all the legendary former guests, and writes about scurrying from floor to floor, \u2018longing for discourse with a gone procession of smoking caterpillars\u2019. It's hard to imagine that kids won't be longing for the same thing with her years after she's gone, and this raw and touching memoir of late-60s, early-70s New York is, if nothing else, a beautiful gift to them. ...more Last year, I read Gloria Steinem's My Life on the Road .

The memoir focuses on her early adult years. She moved to New York, developed a complicated relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe and tried to figure out her place in the world. Rather than making herself sound heroic or tragic or dishing out tawdry gossip, she talks with great openness and generosity about her life, her family and her friends. Much of what she describes is mundane, but she recounts it with so much appreciation for small moments in her life that it's hard not to fall in step with her lovely sensibility. In many ways, I didn't find it easy to connect with the way she lived -- pretty gritty at times -- or her relationship with Mapplethorpe -- but I loved seeing it all though Smith's eyes. It helps that Smith writes really well -- occasionally veering into prose closer to poetry -- stark, simple and expressive. It all made me feel like slowing down -- appreciating what's there -- my family, friends and surroundings. A note on the audio: Smith narrates her own story. She has a slow droning voice.

Not only is it one of the best books I've read this year, it is one of the best books I have ever read.

Knowing very little about Patti Smith or Robert Mapplethorpe going into reading this, I figured I would enjoy it but not quite appreciate it as much as someone who is a big fan of either. And while that might be true, I still came out of this book with the utmost appreciation for both and for those people living, breathing, and being artists today. Because, this book is about art. It's about art that you love so much that you make sacrifices like sleeping on doorsteps or eating anchovy sandwiches. It's about art that consumes you, that frustrates you, that makes you feel alive. Patti Smith is an artist through and through. And I am completely inspired by her story and her companionship with Robert. Hearing about their lives in 1960's and 70's New York City was incredible, meeting the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Janice Joplin, William Burroughs, and so many more incredibly talented artists, poets, musicians, writers, etc. For a short time I was transported into the mind of an artist, into the time of her creative birth, and came out of it with an experience that I won't soon forget. I am sure that I will read this book again in the future and each time take away something more. 5/5 stars ...more Smith writes with a poet's clear imagery and an economy of words all too rare in the memoir genre. Before Robert Mapplethorpe died, Patti Smith promised him that she would one day write the story of their years in New York City. Now, twenty years after his death, she has made good on that promise. This is the story of a beautiful, complex, demanding and ever-evolving friendship between two young, hopeful, actively unconventional creatives.

Before Robert Mapplethorpe died, Patti Smith promised him that she would one day write the story of their years in New York City. Now, twenty years after his death, she has made good on that promise. This is the story of a beautiful, complex, demanding and ever-evolving friendship between two young, hopeful, actively unconventional creatives. They alternated in the role of muse to each other as they felt their way through the New York City art/poetry/theater/music scene of the late 1960s and early 1970s. They were struggling to find their special niches and become accepted as artists. In this process they were often also struggling for simple survival. They frequently went hungry and had no place to sleep, all the while bolstering each other's resolve and refusing to give up their dreams. I never really knew anything about Robert Mapplethorpe aside from a big flap in the 80s about how his work was offensive. Smith writes about him with such tenderness and honesty that I couldn't help weeping when she described his death as a result of AIDS. We should all be so lucky as to have a friend like Patti Smith---a friend who could remember for us our youthful, most hopeful, most vulnerable selves and memorialize us so genuinely. ...more \"What should we aspire to as we go on our road?

As the song goes, pick yourself up, brush yourself off, and start all over again.\" Patti Smith Keynote Speech at Pratt Commencement 2010 One of the most luminous tales of love and grit that I have ever read, set in the mythical and ever-shifting New York City of the 60's and 70's. Watch two young beings become who they are, two small rocks formed by icy water, grain by grain, layer by layer, sustained by an otherwordly faith in their own future. As I devoured this book (I couldn't put it down for three days), I couldn't help but think of this description of Jay Gatsby, which is at the heart of the American Character: \u201cIf personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promise of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the 'creative temperament'--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.\" This is exactly what is being expressed here on every single page: a heightened sensitivity to the promise of life. A romantic readiness such as we rarely get to experience today. A quintessential American love story. ...more Just Kids \u2605\u2605\u2605 3 Stars I am frankly pretty surprised that this popular memoir didn't quite click with me.

Just Kids should've been a perfect match and yet somehow I could never completely connect with the world and the lives of the people it chronicles. Don't get me wrong, Smith's wordsmith is gorgeous and she is a wonderful storyteller. Her account of how she and her lover/collaborator/friend Robert Mapplethorpe, met and ended up right at the center of New York's influential art and music scene during the 60's and 70's is nothing short of remarkable. Just Kids reads like an emotional elegy to Robert Mapplethorpe and a love letter to both him and the city of New York, which at the time was the mecca of the rock and punk movement. Smith is sort of an oral curator as she recounts numerous encounters with an impressive group of artists, the city's rich cultural history and how she and Mapplethorpe became deeply ingrained in it. But throughout most of the narrative I had the sense that Smith seems to define herself and her claim to fame, in proportion to her proximity to other well-known artists. She and Mapplethorpe are never more than two or three degrees separated from the likes of Hendrix, Joplin, Warhol or Dylan. And she makes sure to remind us, over and over again. Her relationship with Mapplethorpe was obviously complex and, at least from the outside, difficult to characterize. But it's obvious that in spite of his sexuality and his very conflicted attitude about it, they seemed to have found in each other a true soul mate. The final chapters, in which she describes Mapplethorpe's last months before dying of complications from HIV/AIDS, are very moving and felt to me like the most authentic part of the story. Maybe this memoir would've had a bigger impact on me had this been the musical soundtrack of my youth. My sense is that I lack both the cultural context and creative sensibility to fully appreciate the contributions made by these artists. Nevertheless, this was an interesting read as I learned quite a lot about a fascinating and influential artistic period. Finally, it would be difficult to replicate the cultural and social atmosphere that allowed Smith and Mapplethorpe to become such iconic figures. It's hard to imagine today's most prominent artists casually rubbing elbows like they did at the Chelsea Hotel back then. I think that's mostly a reflection of a more idealistic and innocent time in America.. I read and simultaneously listened to the audio book, which I have to say is beautifully narrated by the author. ...more \u0388\u03bd\u03b1

And in that folds of faded violet tissue a necklace, two violet plaques etched in Arabic, strung with black and silver threads, given to me by the boy who loved Michelangelo.\" ( watch this and then read) Reading this was an interesting experience for me. Lately I've had a weird but insatiable urge to read memoirs by 1970's musicians. Why? Not really sure - maybe I just need to re-watch Almost Famous . But for whatever reason, I had a particular literary itch to scratch, and only Patti Smith's memoir would do. I had heard Gloria before reading this book, and I knew that Patti Smith was a musician. I had never heard of her lifetime friend and partner Robert Mapplethorpe, and most of the artists who get name-dropped in this book flew right over my head. For this reason, this memoir might as well have been pure fiction to me, since I had almost no frame of reference for anyone except the biggest names. But I think that, ultimately, this worked in my favor: instead of spending every other page thinking, \"oh my god, she totally knew [famous person] before they were famous!\" I was just focusing on the story. And it's quite a story. People who go into this book expecting to learn about Smtih's songwriting/performance career will be disappointed; her retelling of how she became a famous musician is basically \"someone suggested that I try putting my poems to music and people seemed to really like it, so that's cool I guess.\" There's not much about her actual writing process, even. She talks a lot about Rimbaud, and tries very hard to write like him. Occasionally you find yourself rolling your eyes at her prose, but for the most part, her writing is quite lovely. This is, first and last, the story of a lifelong friendship. This is the story of people who sacrificed everything - home, family, comfort, security - in order to become artists. What makes it lovely is that you get the sense that becoming famous - at least, famous in the sense that most people would recognize - never even crossed Smith's mind. She wanted, purely and simply, to devote her life to art. She was poor and homeless and miserable, but she was happy. A true starving-artist story, occasionally overwrought, but always compelling. Patti Smith is cooler than everyone you will ever meet. ...more As he was dying Robert Mapplethorpe ask Patti Smith to write their story; \"You have to he said, no one but you can write it\". After reading this book I can understand why he said that. No biographer, other than Patti, could know, let alone describe, the level of trust and dependence they shared; and their singular kind of love that, even after reading this, is hard for the reader to fully understand.

What capable hands he left that project in, I'm not sure he even realized it, I'm not sure Patti did at that point in her life. But write it she did, and what a magnificent result. I'm in awe of the talent and genius of this woman. She is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for her music; she has received France's highest honor for her contribution to the arts for her drawings and photographs; but her greatest talent may be as a writer for the award winning books she has written, now a winner of the National Book Award for this memoir, Just Kids. 2010 National Book Award winner for non-fiction. ...more

I fell in love with Patti Smith and her music in college twenty+ years ago and loved her raw power and openness. Through her I discovered Mapplethorpe and although I never quite got excited by his more iconic S&M photos, I loved his flowers and his boldness. I knew their myth, but this book gave a greater glimpse into their relationship and the galaxy of their friends. I never knew about her relationship with Sam Smith, Allen Lanier, etc., or her friendship with many of the Chelsea Hotel crowd, beat poets, etc. The book is a great exploration of friendship, love and art. It is also a great tribute to the role of mentors, art benefactors, work, hope, and no small amount of luck in the creation of great art. ...more Did anyone think Patti was \"whitewashing\" her past in this? \"longing. that desire. that tapeworm.a word I hadn't learned\"....

I wore out my welcome buying up discarded books and lurking near the door hoping to nab the overdue offender in their tracks. LOL. Now I'm confused, discombobulated..who is Patti Smith..where is the Patti Smith I thought I knew.. I've ended up only just liking it with 3 stars & my heart has sunk. Another idol demasked or re-masked again. It makes me feel little mean hearted since Patti was my adolescent heroine. Although truth be told on reflection I didn't know zip about her private past, only shadowy images of her with Robert Mapplethorpe. Mainly I knew her voice and her records, those I played over and over. Her poems in my original 1972 copy of \"Seventh Heaven\" was something sacred to me, some holy grail of truth if I could only decode the essence of, I could be like she, or something...such is the stuff of puberty or perhaps I had blinkers on then most likely. Maybe I have a wrong take on this but I feel she's sugar coated her early life with Mapplethorpe. I can't believe she was so naive. In the thick of all the action in NY, at Max's & the Warhol crew. Friends all around doing drugs and she being 23-4 didn't know anything about drugs. Oh come on. At that time I was 14-15 and knew more about the street than she purports to have known. My upbringing not that different or richer or poorer than hers. But she bangs on about how poor her and Robert were in the 70's in the book and I can't really come to grips with her take on things. She's all the \"SERIOUS ARTIST\" and in the world but not of it.?? WTF. Totally dispels any illusions she was all \"sex drugs and rock and roll\". I feel like she's writing this view of herself...\"the goody two shoes naff poet\", for some other person.....her family or children perhaps. Maybe..... The early chapters alternate between her childhood and Roberts. The mid-secton is where I have trouble(as described above). She goes into fairly explicit details about Roberts homosexual adventures and loves, his art/porn and creativity issues and final relationship and death from AIDS. She talks about her trip to Paris and Baudrillard's grave, and she was distanced like I've never felt her distanced in her music or poems. Is that Baudrillard's Simulacra? Something's slightly skewed here because I just didn't feel her passion in \"Just Kids\" - EXCEPT when she was talking about Mapplethorpe's art and death - I didn't get a sense of connection when she talked about her marriage either, it's censored and distanced also.. I think in truth it's not about her it's about Robert. The book is littered with wonderful images of Robert and of her (taken by him). It's more his obituary. It's sad. Sadder than I can say. ...more I didn't just hate this book. I cherished my hatred for this book. Luxuriated in it. Drank deeply of my hatred.

You know in the beginning of the movie \"Labyrinth,\" when Jennifer Connelly is reading out loud from that book about the Goblin King? It sounds like that. I didn't just find Patti Smith kind of strange and off-putting in the way she explains that other people who were not as cool as she may have. I found her (or her portrayal of herself, which is not the same thing) actively frustrating. I'm not sure if she intended, as a writer, for her and Mapplethorpe's pursuit of fame to sound so damn groupie-ish. Lots of tracking down someone who is famous and following him around. ...more I'll say this for Patti Smith: Homegirl certainly knows how to write lifestyle porn.

People do that. Chuck it all, grab a blanket, commit 100 percent to making things. Music. Pictures. Words. More than just teacher-school dropout Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethrope, a skinny kid on the lam from the Catholic church. Every day, maybe even right this second, a kid is climbing off a bus at some junction in New York City, schlepping a dirty military backpack filled with notebooks filled with poetry filled with nature imagery, A copy of Bob Dylan's \"Chronicles\" in his back pocket. He's got two weeks worth of dinero in a two-toned teal velcro wallet and a breathlessness about doing \"whatever it takes washing dishes cleaning toilets as long as I can write.\" He might, like Patti Smith, sleep in a doorway or two. He might, like Patti, find a street angel who will teach him about day-old bread and primo napping places in Central Park. He might get a job at a book store; move into an extended stay hotel full of eccentrics; become a regular at corner bar. He might meet someone who is first his lover, then friend, muse and soul mate. He'll observe and jot and wait for a Warhol-ian figure to notice him, all while experimenting with couplets, then, perhaps free verse, then, perhaps starvation. Published in a zine. A promise for publication on a friend of a friend's website. And after all those PB&Js, after he maybe even finds a word that rhymes with orange, maybe we'll hear about him. We probably won't. Maybe he'll write a book about his soul mate and win a National Book Award. This is in progress right now and right now and even right now. The mere fact that we get to read this portrait of the 1970s art scene from this particular perspective is that they both, Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe, busted through the wall of obscurity. And the reason that this story is thrilling and exciting and tender and tugs at the soul and inspires wanderlust is because you know what was on the other side of that wall: Fame. Tragedy. So what's the difference between Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe and [insert unknown artist's name here]. Is it still possible to be short on cash for a sandwich and have the equivalent of Allen Ginsberg foot the rest of the bill in a madcap case of gender confusion? I can't figure that out. Is it timing? Is it tenacity? Is it talent? You can't just say talent: After reading Belinda Carlisle's memoir last year I realized that underneath the mounds of cocaine and the lipstick was a woman who couldn't play an instrument, didn't write songs, and really didn't know much about singing, who went on to front one of the iconic bands of the 1980s. How did she get there: She hung out at the right clubs on the right West Hollywood street corners and was standing next to the right people when someone decided to start a girl group. All I know is that reading \"Just Kids\" made me want to shed 15 years and ditch out for the big city with a dream journal and a change of socks. That's easy to say, so freshly seduced. This is one of those books that made me think I was born too late. ...more There is a whiff of earnestness about Patti Smith but now we\u2019ve got that out the way, shut up and listen to Horses , Easter , Gone Again and Trampin\u2019 back-to-back for a whole month.

It's in there slightly, but this is really the story of her relationship with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, which if you believe her narrative, she met on her very first day in New York. Do I sound a bit skeptical? I guess ever since feeling like Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace ... One School at a Time was a bunch of shenanigans because of too many spectacular events and otherworldly coincidences (and was proven right), I have a healthy dose of the critical eye when it comes to memoirs where the person writing encounters everyone. It's convenient that most of the people she mentions died before this was published. Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Bob Dylan, William S. Burroughs, Andy Warhol (okay she admits she knew the people who knew him mostly), etc., etc. So the stories are amazing and strange in the way that all these people are normal humans living at the poverty level within this larger movement. And maybe that is the crux of most major artistic moments in time - right place, right time. And if it's all true (and nobody has ever said it isn't), Patti Smith really hit the jackpot. Much of the happenstance occurs around her, but just as much of it happens to her. She seems to fall into art shows and stage productions, even performing music. It's like the people around her are pulling her out because they sense something she doesn't. Or she's being humble. It was hard to tell. Patti writes with great idealism about this time. I'm not sure if she's trying to capture her naivete at the time or if she still lives in that mode, but the beginning and ending of the book, since it starts and ends with Robert's death, gives a rather large punch in the face to the era. AIDS really moved in and destroyed the people who had been creating and interacting so freely in the previous two decades. It was a stark contrast to the open and endless feeling of the time period most of the book focuses on. I enjoyed reading it, even with my spidey sense tingling a little. Getting to know this part of the New York world in the 60s and 70s was very interesting, as I feel like I've read works coming out of it but not much about it itself. But that's the backdrop; this is a story of creative soulmates who are sometimes friends, sometimes lovers, but always in each others lives, pushing them to be greater. ...more Only\u00a0a\u00a0fool would regret\u00a0being had by\u00a0art; or a saint.

Not only did he do a hell of a job, he also provided a plethora of information on pretty much every name mentioned in the book. Great, great work! As for the book itself, it's an account of Smith's progress in becoming one of the most acknowledged figures of rock art, focusing on her relationship with Robert Mapplethorp, the photographer who influenced her art and personality more than anyone. Her prose is flat most of the time, with sudden outbursts of lyricism and sentiment that seem to leak from the pages. Does she sugar-coat her relationship with Robert? I think it may look like she does but she practically doesn't. Yes, it all looks taken out of a romance novel but we're talking about the 60's and 70's in New York! What's more, don't we all tend to sprinkle fairy dust on our most precious memories? Besides, she doesn't hesitate to analyze the turbulences caused by Robert's sentimental instability. All the references, the poetry, the wild atmosphere of one of the wildest periods in modern history and, of course, Smith's prose made this book a perfect read for me and a thesaurus of knowledge on many subjects. *\u039f \u0391\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b7\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c6\u03c9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2 \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 Fight Club, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03ce\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 M Train \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 Patti Smith. ...more The runaway artist is a typical phase of adolescence, and the true measure of one\u2019s devotion to a creative life is the ability to sustain the kind of drive that can keep you going through the hunger, cold, loneliness and (perhaps worst of all) the disillusionment of adulthood.

The last thing an artist wants to be is a \u201csell out,\u201d but then again, how do you get to make a living from art if you don\u2019t meet the right people at the right time and make a name for yourself? Where is the line drawn between security and freedom? How much of one do you have to give up for the other? Just Kids doesn\u2019t necessarily answer any of these questions, at least not directly, but I kept thinking about them as I was reading. Although it is a memoir, I read Just Kids for the same reason I read fiction: I wanted to experience something out of my reach, to use my imagination to enter a world that is not only closed to me, but in many ways may never have existed at all. Sorry to sound so enigmatic; what I mean is, though Patti Smith takes you on a trip to the early 70\u2019s in New York, it is her 70s, her New York, and she is often rather oblique in her self-examination, and excessively generous in her descriptions of others. No one ever seems to do anything wrong, and even when they do, that\u2019s ok because it\u2019s all about freedom and art. Never mind sexually transmitted diseases or treading on anyone\u2019s toes, it\u2019s all about the elusive fame and fortune hovering just an exhibition away. I like Patti Smith, though coming into this book I knew very little about her. I knew she had been friends with Robert Mapplethorpe (who I knew a bit more about, thanks to my own time in art school), and that she was a proto-punk songwriter who had been one of Mapplethorpe\u2019s original photography subjects. Her style is clear if a bit overwrought at times, and her devotion to Mapplethorpe while he struggled with his sexual identity, and later with AIDS, is very touching. I think the book is at its best when it describes the little moments of intense friendship between the two, and at its weakest when Smith finds it necessary to attribute so much of their success to fate and signs. Yes, there are often moments in life that seem fortuitous or somehow preordained, but Smith is a bit heavy with the symbolic meaning of little things. I really did like this book a great deal, as it allowed me to experience the kind of life I used to fantasize about when I was younger (and still think about now). To learn about the times or even Smith and Mapplethorpe themselves doesn\u2019t really seem to be the point of this memoir; rather it is a memorial to a beloved friend and a tiny capsule capturing an intense and influential relationship between two great artists during a wildly exhilarating time in New York City, when Andy Warhol and Pop were on the way out, and Robert Mapplethorpe and punk rock were taking over. Good times. ...more It is difficult for me to think of an artist who illuminates pure positive affect in the way that Patti Smith does.

For me, the record has a similar effect to Allen Ginsberg's, \"Howl,\" and Walt Whitman's, \"Song of Myself.\" The passion, the energy, the blood-racing anticipation between her vocal crescendos... It is absolutely on fire. However, I have found that \"Horses\" is a rather polarizing record. People who are into rock and roll either like it or hate it. I love it. My brain chemistry gets perfectly locked into Patti's grooves, and I'm happy to know that I can revisit this amazing album throughout my life anytime I feel the need. When \"Just Kids\" came out, I realized that it had been quite some time since I had last thought of Patti Smith. My reading habits have changed a lot throughout the years, and I'm generally not a fan of biographies. However, I knew I would enjoy this one. I was simply waiting for the right time to read it. One of the many things that fascinates me about Patti Smith is that she was simply a naive and innocent child full of so much wonderful curiosity, a perpetual outsider who had no misgivings over the fact that life would be an uphill battle. Unlike many artists whose early lives were subject to torment and desperation, Patti came from a humble and loving home. Patti was not abused by her family, (she actually spoke very tenderly of her parents and siblings), nor did she express any excessive disdain towards those she encountered during her early struggles, (not even towards her factory coworkers who dehumanized her; thus providing the impetus for her song, \"Piss Factory,\" nor the prying and judgmental eyes during her teenage pregnancy.) And even though she arrived in New York homeless and hungry and would generally fare no better until the latter end of the '70s, Patti's enthusiasm and diligence completely outshined her hardships. Patti was in love with life. She was intoxicated with the freedom that came with being a young artist in a city of the world; finding inspiration and friendship during the unlikeliest moments, and holding onto these moments until they became the core of her being. One of the things I adore most about Patti Smith is her ability to live simultaneously inside her own head, completely losing herself within a sanctimonious inner world of books, dead poets, and philosophers, while also living very much in the moment. All of her encounters with '60s rockers like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Grace Slick, along with her introductions to future celebrity artists, like Jim Carroll, Sam Shepard, and Tom Verlaine among many others, excited her, energized her, and gave her a great sense of fortune. She never took any of these encounters for granted and she continues to keep these people close to her heart to this day. Patti also never denied nor shied away from the influence of those who came before her, (particularly Jim Morrison and Arthur Rimbaud). I particularly enjoyed the passage in the book where she visited both of these young men's graves in Paris. The only thing I haven't mentioned yet is Patti's friendship to Robert Mapplethorpe. What a sweet, sweet thing. Their bond was beyond friendship, beyond physical love. These two were soulmates in the classic sense. Robert and Patti completed one another, challenged one another, and guided one another throughout every course in their lives. Even her descriptions of their simplest outings and everyday musings came across as life-changing journeys. She pulls this off without being overly dramatic or grandiose because the love these two had for one another was complete, endless, and beautiful, and it was perfectly captured in this book. I was a little surprised that Patti didn't delve more into the lives of her bandmates, her children, or her husband, the late, great Fred \"Sonic\" Smith. But then again, as she firmly stated, this was she and Robert's story, and she promised him that one day she would write it and share it with the world. That's precisely what she has done, and I'm very thankful for her doing so. This book was a glorious experience for me. ...more 2.5 stars I'm sure it's just me, not Patti Smith's 2010 National Book Award-winning memoir Just Kids , but I simply could not get into this book.

I also (back in the days of my living near MOCA, LACMA and the Getty Museums in Los Angeles) consider(ed) myself an art asthete (and if I still lived there, would almost certainly have checked out Ms. Smith's friend, partner and collaborator Robert Mapplethorpe's monster 2016 retrospective of his photography), but this book (while movingly capturing Ms. Smith's grief following Mapplethorpe's death in 1989 at the height of the AIDS epidemic) didn't quite do it for me. The one thing I think she did do well was capture the \"Starving Artist\" scene in late '60s-early '70s New York City, but the never-ending name dropping and overblown writing (with dozens of non sequitur references to her obvious poet-idols Arthur Rimbaud and Charles Baudelaire) served as distraction to Ms. Smith's depiction of the oft-stormy relationship between Smith and Mapplethorpe. Just when I was really getting interested (in their stories), she'd wheel out the cavalcade of names that she'd attributed to their success, and I'd be bored insensate. Also, in her descriptions of their ascendancies to fame, I never truly got a feel for why they were so successful (other than their association with all the famous people (many of whom I'd never heard of and had to take her words for it as to how influential they were). The few poems of hers that were included here (with the exception of the two in memoriam of Mapplethorpe at the end) simply weren't very good; and the photos sprinkled throughout never really gave me a feel of Mapplethorpe's talent. (Had I not seen a few of his photos in LACMA's permanent collection, I would just have to take her word for it that he had an artistic gift.) But, again, I'm sure it's me: most of my friends loved this memoir. I'm still glad I read it, as I learned a bunch from the NYC art scene, but Just Kids just wasn't quite what I'd hoped for. I'm not sure her later-released M Train will be either, alas. ...more just got the kindle preview. could be annoying or great. * * * * * * Finished this last night. Of Mapplethorpe and Smith's relationship, I'll only say that I found it sweet and sad. Other things interested me about this book more. I have to agree with Yahaira, it was both annoying and great.

The starving artist / wannabe might be a phase lots of kids and young people went through before they turned into responsible adults, but it is one I skipped entirely, so yeah, while I found some of the writing and the subjects irritating, I thought this was a fascinating portal into the successful incubation of a couple of artists who may or may not have been remarkably talented, but were undeniably successful. Like No Direction Home, the documentary about Bob Dylan, Just Kids left me thinking that maybe the most important factor in this kind of artistic / commercial success is being in the right place at the right time. It's not that I think Dylan or Smith or Mapplethorpe were not talented, but I'm just not convinced that in their natural state, outside of that environment, any of them possessed much more genius than anyone else--or at least not as much genius as is attributed to each of them today. Other contributing factors: the related factor of meeting the right people, and time, lots of time for ideas to incubate, which means not really having a job or the overwhelming (and middle-class) sense of obligation and responsibility that drives some of us to feel that we have to eat or have a roof over our heads. It did surprise me how materialistic (and I don't mean that in the yuppie sense) Smith was - a total magpie. It was also interesting how much she recalled and wrote about what she or Mapplethorpe wore. Both she and Mapplethorpe reminded me a lot of those characters in Sartre's writings who were meant to be foils for existentialism: people obsessed with creating \"situations,\" seeing life as one big performance. Now, existentialism is one phase I *did* go through. Maybe it's the wannabe phase for hyper-rational, hyper-analytical kids like me. In a way, it pushed me to become a teacher after college, to want to *do* something in the world. As much as I've always wished I had the talent to be an artist, it's possible that I never could have been one anyway, for having the wrong philosophy. ...more", "Title": "Just Kids"},
