{"Comments": "I was lucky enough to get my hands on an early copy of this novel. What an exciting story! The characters are all interesting and unique - I'm glad that the author develops their storylines. And the ending was such a twist! I didn't expect it at all. Definitely read <+++>The Mystery of Revenge</+++>! It's a quick and enjoyable read. I loved it! This is a book more than just a mystery. The suspense keeps me going and I just can't wait to find out the ending of this mystery. Along the way of reading I can't help appreciating the well-woven plot as well as the beautiful and sentimental narration the writer reveals in her story telling. It is hard to find a clean book with this high level of entertainment. It is a good read! What a fun book! I couldn\u2019t put it down! Finished in one setting because I wanted to know whodunit, which was a huge surprise of course. \u4e2d\u56fd\u51fa\u8eab\u306e\u5973\u6d41\u4f5c\u5bb6\u306e\u529b\u4f5c\u3067\u3059\u3002\u5c0f\u8aac\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u305f\u3044\u3078\u3093\u8fbc\u307f\u5165\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u8aad\u307f\u59cb\u3081\u305f\u3089\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u304f\u3066\uff0c\u8f9e\u66f8\u3092\u501f\u308a\u306a\u304c\u3089\u5922\u4e2d\u3067\u6700\u5f8c\u307e\u3067\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u3057\u307e\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u601d\u3044\u304b\u3052\u306a\u3044\u7d50\u672b\u3082\u306a\u304b\u306a\u304b\u826f\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002 Interesting story! Cannot wait until next one... My friend brought the novel and told me about it with enraptured expression on his face. I couldn't wait to get my own copy. Thanks to Amazon's fast delivery, I opened the book immediately and almost read it throughth with no time! The story is really unexpected and wonderful structured! No wonder my friends did not want to tell me the story before I read it - unexpectedly twist at the END! I Expect more books from her.<---F> Congratulations, G</---F>.X. CHEN! I won this book and was eager to read it. I was not disappointed. This novel was a well-constructed, easy read. It captured my attention from the get-go and held it until the end. The infusion of Chinese culture with a thrilling mystery was great! <+++>The Mystery of Revenge</+++> <---A>G.X. Chen</---A> easy reading, yet page turning. A good book should have an unexpected ending, which this one does. Enjoyed it very much. Be sure to bring along on your summer vacation, it will make your ride to destination so much quicker I love those characters who are so vivid and realistic. Great storylines and surprising ending. Definitely a must read. I love the story especially at the end and her characters in the book. I personal strongly recommended. A page-turner! Such a plot that I couldn\u2019t put it down until the end which is a huge surprise to me. A summer beach book, an easy read and extremely entertaining. Love it. This review is from: The Mystery of Revenge (<---B>Kindle Edition</---B>) To get the ultimate revenge one must be very clever. A young girl from China looking for the American dream is not satisfied, and thinks the grass is greener somewhere else, but she is sadly mistaken. Her friends don't understand,<---M> her husband doesn't understand</---M>, and Yi-yen understands only too well and now must deal with the shame. The book has an interesting storyline and the characters are well developed and realistic. The nasty owner of China Dragon reminded me of someone I used to work for. The author did a good job keep me interested and engaged. I'm normally very good at guessing but didn't see it coming - the ending is a good surprise. I enjoy reading the book, therefore recommend it. I loved it. Such a fun yet exciting book to read. Finished it at no time - not my usual book reading pattern. If you were or are a poor student, or a poor foreign student, you can relate to many of the characters. The ending was unexpected, which is a bonus. My goodness, just like the other readers said so well; this book is absolutely worth reading. I could never have imaged how the story ends. Don't cheat like I did, I read the end of the book 1st ( LOL); but I didn't lose any interests. Couldn't have been better...Keep going Ms. Chen! This book was slow to start and I was a little disappointed with it. I'm used to my mystery novels having more action and suspense. This book was told in a past / present style by many of the characters, which made it a little hard to follow, plus I really don't remember the author stating the time period of the story. I was interested in how the Chinese immigrants came to America and how they made a life for themselves here. Yi-Yun and Fang Chen marry and start a life for themselves. Eventually This book was slow to start and I was a little disappointed with it. I'm used to my mystery novels having more action and suspense. This book was told in a past / present style by many of the characters, which made it a little hard to follow, plus I really don't remember the author stating the time period of the story. I was interested in how the Chinese immigrants came to America and how they made a life for themselves here. Yi-Yun and Fang Chen marry and start a life for themselves. Eventually, Yi-Yun gets bored with home life as Fang is working and studying all the time. This boredom leads her to another man, a struggling selfish concert pianist. The characters were hard to like, especially Yi-Yun, and most seemed one dimensional, selfish and shallow. I must say however, the ending was different and not what I expected. ...more I received this book through the Goodreads Giveaway. This book was a very quick read as it is only 160 pages long. It wasn't a bad story, I just felt like it was all over the place. It kept jumping back and forth in time and between characters. Which kind of disrupted the flow of the story, for me at least. The writer did a good job at keeping you wondering who the actual killer was. Usually I can figure out how its going to end half way through, but didn't really expect the ending I got. The ending IS predictable despite the reviews. No characters are particularly likeable and don't relate too well. Mercifully quick read though.<---C>G.X.
