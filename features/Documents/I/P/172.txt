Instead of falling into the \"he (<---B>or she</---B>) said\" pitfall, the dialogue takes on the action of the predominant emotion. If he wants to reach for a friend, the words reach. And the way he breaks his sentences to evoke emotional pauses is poetic. Plus it makes his stories delectably quick to read. The perfect combination of length and pause. But his prose is not even the most powerful thing about his writing. Zusak pulls the words li I can't seem to get enough Zusak. Once again his language is magic. Instead of falling into the \"he (or she) said\" pitfall, the dialogue takes on the action of the predominant emotion. If he wants to reach for a friend, the words reach. And the way he breaks his sentences to evoke emotional pauses is poetic. Plus it makes his stories delectably quick to read. The perfect combination of length and pause. But his prose is not even the most powerful thing about his writing. Zusak pulls the words lingering on the edge of your brain as if you'd written them yourself. In a way, his writing transcends language. Here we have an ordinary 19-year-old taxi driver who is going nowhere with his life and has no plans to ever make something of himself either. When Ed inadvertently foils a bank robbery, he is praised as a local hero. Some people have it in them to make a stand, to be more than ordinary. That's when the assignments come. Written on the ace of diamonds are three addresses. Ed must figure out who is in need of help at these locations and what he can do to touch their lives. As Ed engulfs himself into these strangers' lives he learns to care for them personally and insightfully discovers a message for them that will alter their lives. Sometimes the messages are easy to deliver, other times they require all he can muster to give. But always he finds the courage to follow through. And his answers are never what I would expect. \"There are countless saints who have nothing to do with church and almost no knowledge of God. But they say God walks with those people without them ever knowing it.\" As we follow Ed through his journey from \"just another stupid person\" to messenger, we see him grow emotionally as the assignments touch him deeper. In touching other people's lives he finds the purpose in his, his way of being great. At one point he says he thought he was doing one of these people a favor but \"I realize it's the opposite. I'm the privileged one.\" Is that not how it always is? We don't want to get involved with helping other people, even developing new friendships, because it require something from us. But what we fail to realize is what we get out of it is more than what we put in it. The effort to connect with people instead of drift through each other's lives is always worth it. (view spoiler) [It took me a second read through the twist at the end to realize the stranger on the couch was Zusak. I think the tool was more surreal when Vonnegut used it (maybe that's because it's the first time I'd encountered it), but here its purpose is to bring home the powerful message of the last card and so intense in its own way. (hide spoiler) ] We are left with our own challenge. We find our own names on an ace and we can take this message as ours: that anyone, no matter how ordinary can be great, and put it to practice in our own lives. Or we can discard our aces and go back to going through the motions. ...more 4.5 Stars. Hello There. Maybe you're here because you've read the book and you loved it.

In that case, let me be precise and say, Go Read it. Now. Or Maybe you don't like this book. I can't even believe it's possible but well, what a pity. So, Let me tell you a story. The story of my enigmatic foray into Ed's world and the events that follow. My Prologue : They say that Marcus Zusak is a brilliant storyteller who has a knack for mesmerizing readers into a trance with his words and his well-woven tale. And they are right. The book started in a way most books do and ended....that's better told later. Yep, It started dramatically, A bank robbery. Ed introduces himself to us readers and when he says, \u201cMy full name\u2019s Ed Kennedy. I\u2019m nineteen. I\u2019m an underage cabdriver. I\u2019m typical of many of the young men you see in this suburban outpost of the city\u2014not a whole lot of prospects or possibility. That aside, I read more books than I should, and I\u2019m decidedly crap at sex and doing my taxes. Nice to meet you.\u201d I couldn't help but fall in love his brutal honesty a bit. Mostly when I meet male protagonists they are unabashedly meretricious and boastful about their sexual prowess. So it was nice to have someone different like Ed. But only later did I begin to realize how unique a protagonist Mr. Zusak had presented. Initially, as the pages flew by, I started liking less and less of him. I honestly admit that. Because the premise was vague and he was getting very hyped up and the Ace made no sense whatsoever. ( If you don't know what I'm talking about, read the blurb. ) I couldn't understand him. And I was starting to fear that maybe I won't like the book after all. Reflecting now, I realize how frivolous that fear is. This book was destined to be a favorite of mine. It just was. Ed's narrative was cogent enough but at times bordered on getting histrionic. Don't get me wrong, it was really enjoyable but it didn't look like a 19-year old guy speaking. It was like someone was writing a beautiful poem or something instead of a story at times. It confused me, unnerved me and rang like a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. At that time I didn't know why. But then I was reading another book, and like an epiphany, I realized it was because I do that a lot too. I conjectured that maybe it's because he reads a lot of books. People who read a lot become naturally eloquent with their spiels. I'm no good storyteller or even possess a modicum of empathetic writing skills but in some way, I'm just commenting on the writing style, I write like that. A bit. But I do have a penchant for, maybe even a propensity to poetic litany, as may be evident from my raving reviews where all I do is prosaically ramble. And then, when those boisterous words became my friends I was just swept off my feet. No looking back. After understanding this and coming to terms with the mysterious instances of the story I was hooked in. Simply so awed by the sheer idea of it. And I wanted nothing more than to know who was behind all this ? Who ? All the painstaking frenzy. The rigmarole. All this and one question, Who ? Why ? And when I did get the answer much later, I wanted nothing but shout it out loud. Why ? Simple, because I felt like it. Ed sees a plethora of quandaries and concerns, and along with him we see it with a shattering clarity which I must attribute to his perspicacity. Mental dejection and Physical abuse. Smothering solitude or inundating also-rans. Lost love and lost purposes and scabrous violence. There is so much around us that happens. The bad. The worse. The unjust. The unrighteous. The simply sad. So much but do we spare a single second to think about them. We don't. Because it's not our responsibility. Because we have our problems to heed to without the burden of others. Because we are selfish. Ed is both the messenger and the message. But the book has a translucent plane of dubiety and one can interpret it in different ways. \"For me, it means that in our self centered existence we have forgotten the beauty of the happiness that blossoms when we see the genuine smile we have helped bring forth. And in that process we discover ourselves. Yes we, always do.\" That moment of sheer unwonted joy was and still is unmistakably the favorite one of mine. It's like I can imagine the look on Ed's face. Because that's what is on mine too. The writing was good. There was a certain desperation in the words to be heard out, that threatened to become vociferous. It was irksome in the beginning but slowly became dearer and now, it is somehow etched on my mind. And the ending. So there was Scarlet , and I quote her verbatim, \"pure unadulterated Zusak genius\" , she told me. Truer words never spoken. Rose said that it is a bit confusing, it takes time to sink in and when it does it haunts you. She is just so right. And Summer recommended it to me and told me that I'd love it. And I did, didn't I ? I think I'm procrastinating telling you about the ending because in all honesty, I don't know what to say. It was, BRILLIANCE, in all it's labyrinthine glory. In all it's ardent verity. And in all it's indelible beauty. Well. Haven't I said enough ? ...more My full name\u2019s Ed Kennedy. I\u2019m nineteen. I\u2019m an underage cabdriver. I\u2019m typical of many of the young men you see in this suburban outpost of the city \u2013 not a whole lot of prospects or possibility. That aside, I read more books than I should, and I\u2019m decidedly crap at sex and doing my taxes. Nice to meet you. After accidentally preventing a bank robber from escaping, Ed Kennedy receives his first playing card with three addresses written on it. He understands that he needs to deliver a message to My full name\u2019s Ed Kennedy. I\u2019m nineteen. I\u2019m an underage cabdriver. I\u2019m typical of many of the young men you see in this suburban outpost of the city \u2013 not a whole lot of prospects or possibility. That aside, I read more books than I should, and I\u2019m decidedly crap at sex and doing my taxes. Nice to meet you. After accidentally preventing a bank robber from escaping, Ed Kennedy receives his first playing card with three addresses written on it. He understands that he needs to deliver a message to each of these places, but the card offers no further instructions. Relying on his intuition alone, Ed starts touching people\u2019s lives and trying to understand what he has to do. The messages vary from simple to horribly complex and painful, but they all have one thing in common: they need Ed to shake them up and save them from themselves. I think the most wonderful thing about Zusak is the surprising humanity of his characters. Not only do they come alive for the reader, but they also take so many different roles in the process. Their simple acts of kindness often end up being impressive and life-changing. I\u2019d noticed this about so many characters in The Book Thief and I feared it was a one-time deal, but Ed might be the best of them all. In complete contrast to the ending, Ed is one of the most real and tangible characters I\u2019ve ever stumbled upon. The fact that he\u2019s completely unaware of how extraordinary he is just adds to his charm. My only regret is that the same cannot be said about <---C>Audrey</---C>. I really needed her to be just as well developed, but she was the only one who didn\u2019t feel real to me, and that\u2019s the sole reason for my 4-star rating. <+++>I Am the Messenger</+++> will make you happy in at least three ways: it will give you a truly authentic, approachable story that will go straight through your heart, it will make you examine the way you treat complete strangers and it will catch you completely off guard. I wish I could hold up that knife and tear open the world. I\u2019d slice it open and climb through to the next one. In bed, I cling to that thought. I suppose many people will not be comfortable with the ending. I thought it was unexpected, brilliant (like the man himself), mind-blowing (still picking up the pieces) and audacious. It didn\u2019t take anything from the story, it didn\u2019t diminish the importance of any of the characters, and it added an extra dose of memorability the book wouldn\u2019t necessarily have otherwise. Choosing a favorite quote this time was just like choosing a favorite child, but there was one I needed to share: What would you do if you were me? Tell me. Please tell me! But you\u2019re far from this. Your fingers turn the strangeness of these pages that somehow connect my life to yours. Your eyes are safe. The story is just another few hundred pages of your mind. For me, it\u2019s here. It\u2019s now. I have to go through with this, considering the cost at every turn. Nothing will ever be the same.

Apart from books by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, this is my first foray into young adult literature and I enjoyed it immensely. I think the first thing that pulled me in was that Ed is a lot like I was at nineteen. I like to think I had a little more confidence but I had no idea what I wanted to do either and I'm reasonably sure I was secretly in love with a girl who was only interested in being friends at the time as well. And hell, I'm damn sure I would have taken up the messenger role like Ed did had I gotten playing cards in the mail. The supporting cast was very well done, from Ed's friends Marv, Ritchie, and Audrey, to the people he bore messages to, like Sophie, Milla, and the spoilerific rest of them. The writing was superb. I liked Ed's self-deprecating sense of humor and found a lot of parts very touching. (view spoiler) [I even shed some silent man tears when Marv met his daughter for the first time. (hide spoiler) ] The ending wasn't anything I predicted but it ended well. I had a lot more to say about this while I was reading it but got caught up in the story and forgot most of what I'd planned. Kind of like waking from a dream and resolving to write it down in the morning, then not being able to remember anything at all. It reminded me of G.K.

Do not be fooled by my 2.5 stars rating : I Am the Messenger is not one of those books. Indeed this rating is to be taken as a chicken-hearted average to somehow express the utter confusion I've been feeling. Here's the thing : While I cannot deny that some parts were pretty great , especially when it comes to the pacing (rather fast-paced , even though it took me 4 days to read it, which is a lot for me) and that I liked most of the writing - - Oh, about that. Markus Zusak 's writing often revolves around short sentences - now, I know that some readers don't like them, but I often find myself enjoying that kind of writing when done well. Yet it is a little too dramatic sometimes, I can't deny it. However, it sounded perfect to convey Ed's sarcasm and \"woe-is-me\" general attitude , and contributed to make the novel seem more action-packed... Except. When it is. Written. In. Fragments. (and let it be known that I enjoy Blake Crouch 's writing, so it is not a peeve of mine usually) ... I was less than impressed with the constant undercurrent of sexism , didn't like the cop-out ending (I don't know if I expected too much, but it was a real letdown) (also, it has been done before) (I did roll my eyes) (oops) (but for fuck sake, cheesy much?) and developed an annoyance/love/hate relationship with Ed , the MC. Ed, Ed, Ed ... ++ Self-depreciating but oh so sarcastic voice : Ed is sure flawed and I wanted to smack him several times, but I still liked him. \"Taxi driver. Local loser. Cornerstone of mediocrity. Sexual midget. Pathetic card-player. And now weird-shit magnet on top of it. Admit it. It's not a bad list I'm building up.\" See what I mean? Albeit unintentionally sometimes, I couldn't help but laugh. - - I bitch, you bitch, he bitches : Can his friends really called friends? He seems to spend the whole book complaining about them. Well to be fair, he spends a huge amount of time bitching about himself too. - - Some of his decisions didn't sit well with me : indeed something broke in me when he decided to wait before acting on the fucking rapist case. I'm not saying that I couldn't understand it but why not warn someone?? Why did Markus Zusak decide to make it okay for us to witness someone being raped countless times (not graphic, but we know it is happening) before moving along the plot? WHY? It made me sick. Also. The brothers? Well. Not impressed by his solution is the only thing I can say. Aw poor guys needed to bond over violence. I might shed a tear. Not. - - - But my main complain is the fact that in my opinion the whole novel is incredibly sexist . I mean, did you see the female characters? Above that, did you freaking notice how Ed described them? Apart from Milla, the octogenarian, every female character is portrayed through her sexual behavior and her looks, (view spoiler) [even Ed's mother, in the end (hide spoiler) ] . I will not bore you through the details (but silly bitch , really? REALLY?), but it bothered me very much. Not to mention Ed's weird obsession on women legs (no exaggeration) and the way he tries to convince us that Audrey must have sex with him. Why the fuck should she, really. Finally, am I the only one who found Sophie's parts incredibly disturbing? I know she's 15 and not 8, BUT the way Ed emphasizes on her very young age all the time got to me after a while and therefore I couldn't help but find his attraction a little gross. Honestly, I would probably praise the originality of the plot if not for I know, I know, they're far from carbon copies of each other's but I cannot help but think that I would have enjoyed I Am the Messenger more if I wasn't a huge fan of Am\u00e9lie Poulain and her missions. What can I say, the story was more fun in Montmartre... (these horses were the reason of many tantrums when I was a toddler - sorry mum ) ...than in... Where the fuck is this town , anyway? Oh. Never mind. Moreover, if you ever watched Am\u00e9lie Poulain , you know that I Am the Messenger would make it incredibly difficult to suspend our disbelief sometimes. Far from me the intent of spoiling the plot, so I'll let it at that, but damn, it ruined the \"shock value\" of the ending in my opinion. Alright, the atmosphere of the book does make what's unbelievable *almost* acceptable, but please, please , do not hide behind sentences like, \"I really don\u2019t know why I did that\" - it annoys me to no end. Many readers pointed that the message was beautiful and I don't want to be a spoil-fun, because it is, in some way, but why did Markus Zusak have to be so IN YOUR FACE about it? So glaringly obvious? \"Sometimes people are beautiful. Not in looks. Not in what they say. Just in what they are.\" See this sentence? Nobody can disagree with that, and yet... I'm sorry, but it reads like a Nike advertisement. \u25ba So much time spent pushing at open doors really . Disappointing read.

The story and the reader's voice are mesmerizing! Don't want it to end. Review starts here: There's a series on PBS about these doctors--it may even be called \"The Doctors,\" (can't remember)--anyway it's a documentary that follows a handful of Harvard Medical students from their first days in the classroom, to residency, to their eventual careers. I haven't seen each episode but my boyfriend was telling me how one of the students went on to become an ophthalmologist and would go to third world countries to examine people and hand out glasses every chance he got. He (the doctor) also confessed to being lonely because he worked so much and went on to talk about how when he retires he wants to travel and distribute more glasses. My reaction was that a lot people who recognize where there is a need somewhere see it as something so overwhelming that even if they were to do something THAT something wouldn't be enough so they choose to do nothing (or, at least I tend to feel that way). Whereas this guy is working hard and when the time comes for him to stop working and take some time for himself and his family all he can think about is all the people out there whose lives would be improved if they just had a new pair of glasses. So simple. God bless him. This, for me, is the message of Zusak's \"I Am The Messenger\": You don't have to be great to do good, you just have to do it. The story's protagonist, Ed Kennedy, is (as the book emphasizes) an ordinary 19 year old guy. He has no special skills, or talents. He's not really strong, or really funny, or really good at math. He's a cabbie who plays cards with his friends and has had a crush on the same girl since he sprouted his first pube but is way too passive and laid-back to do anything about it, like, for example, move on when it's not reciprocated. Ed's Mom is a complete nag who makes it clear to him that she prefers his siblings to him and that she expects nothing more from him than for him to fuck up. Yet Ed, like most ordinary 19 year olds, doesn't dwell on his unfortunate relationship with his mother. Or the unfortunate state of affairs that are his life. But the unfortunate byproduct of Ed's unfortunate obliviousness to the reality of the world around him is that Ed is missing out on the big things. Like he says at one point \"Big things are just the small things you notice.\" (Or something like that.) Much like The Ghost of Christmas Past or Earl's list of bad deeds he must apologize for in the name of Karma, an outside source enters Ed's life to help lead him off the road of mediocrity and onto the road of good deeds. Ed's messages from an ominous stranger come in the form of playing cards in his mailbox with cryptic clues written on the back that Ed then must decipher and act upon. Ed has no clue who's behind the cards, or what the purpose of all this is but he carries on, unwittingly improving the lives of all the other ordinary people around him and in the process coming to understand himself, his mother, his friends and the girl who is the object of his desire on a deeper level. What I loved so much about this book, aside from the writing and the characters and the setting and the suspense and the emotion, was that despite the novel's outlandishness, Ed's achievements and his impact on others is completely believable. You know that there is nothing significant about Ed. He has no superpowers, his acts of goodness were not preordained. Yet you don't doubt for a second that Ed's simple deeds make his world a better place. This story is sweet and thrilling and captivating and inspiring. I have no idea what makes it a \"Young Adult\" book and I refuse to be embarrassed for liking it so much. Unlike \"The Hills\" which is clearly young adult and something any person over the age of 21 should be embarrassed to admit to liking. Fucking Spencer! What an asshole! ...more I threw this book across the room, and then I picked it back up, held it at arms length, and shook my head at it.

First of all, it took me a long time to read this book, but it wasn't the books fault. I had to study for a test to get into college (I got accepted, YAY!), so my reading had to suffer from it. But even that didn't stop me from enjoying this book completely. I think if I had the time I would finish it in one sitting. At the beginning, I thought that I was reading just an ordinary book, with ordinary characters and their ordinary lives. But now, that I've finished it, I can say that this book is anything but ordinary. It made me laugh, it made me tear up, it made me angry, and at the ending it left me feeling emotionally drained, but also really happy (if that makes any sense). It really touched me, and made me think about things that I (and a lot of us) just take for granted. I can't count the times when I've read a quote from this book that made me stop reading and just think about it for a few seconds. And the ending is the reason that I ended up liking this book even more than the The Book Thief . I'm not gonna say anything about the ending, except that it blew my mind and that I still get goosebumps thinking about it. So I think that's enough from me, cause I feel like if I continue I'll start getting emotional, and I wouldn't want that. So in conclusion, amazing book that will stick with me for the rest of my life, and that I will definitely come back to more than once. ...more Stamp it on my forehead, folks.

I love The Book Thief so much that I was a little afraid to read more of Zusak's work just because my standards for his writing were set so ridiculously high. But, I shouldn't have worried, because I Am the Messenger is also super-duper amazing. Is it as phenomenal as The Book Thief ? Eh, I don't know. It's hard to compare the two, since they're so drastically different. But this one was definitely just as powerful and unforgettable. I've come to believe that Markus Zusak is just a magical writing god and that everything he touches turns to gold. He makes me want to throw my own writing in a fire. His writing is just so fantastic and his characters are so real ... It's just not fair. Plus he's also REALLY GODDAMN ATTRACTIVE. Gosh ... some people ... I just can't ... OKAY. I'm actually going to review this book now. I Am the Messenger is the story of 19-year-old Ed Kennedy, an underage cab driver who basically just plays cards and sucks at romance, and essentially isn't going anywhere in life. Then one day, by chance, he ends up stopping a bank robbery ... and from there, things start to get interesting. Ed begins receiving playing cards with addresses written on them\u2013\u2013and soon finds that he is being sent all over town to people who need his help. The question is, who is sending these cards and why have they chosen Ed? \"Beautiful\" is the first word that comes to mind when I think of this book. Because, it just is. Altogether, it's a pretty feel-good and uplifting story about the simple goodness of human nature, and about how the smallest actions can really change people's lives. But, don't get me wrong; this isn't the \" Pay It Forward \" type of corny it sounds like. First of all, Ed is no \"Gary Stu\" of a character. He's sarcastic, he messes up, he makes mistakes ... he even has to hurt a few people along the way in order for things to work out. So, it's not like he's some kind of magical guardian angel; he's conflicted about a lot of the things he has to do, and nervous to get involved in some people's lives\u2013\u2013because he has to get involved in some pretty intense stuff. Basically, you just have to experience it. I found it to be really wonderfully written and executed, perfectly paced, hilarious, tragic, compelling, hopeful, believable ... Ahhh, it's just gorgeous. I give it an easy 5 stars and a standing ovation. ...more Markus Zusak does not disappoint!

So despite the general hilarity of the book, which had me in splits before the first chapter was even up, a small part of me was subconsciously waiting for the other shoe to drop \u2013 waiting for the tears and the heartbreak I was so sure would come. And it never came - well, not in the way I expected. The tears I cried were happy tears and the parts that stabbed my heart didn't really break it, just pricked it enough to make me feel a weird mix of happy and sad. In that respect, I am the Messenger is utterly different from The Book Thief - it won't make you curl up in bed and cry your eyes out. But that doesn't mean it's any less magnificent a book. I am the Messenger tells the story of Ed - who, in his own words, is \"nineteen, a cab-driver, with no real career, no respect in the community, nothing\" - the utmost epitome of ordinariness. Until a bank holdup gets in the way. Ed starts receiving Aces in his mail directing him to people he must deliver messages to - only, Ed must figure out the message himself. This book is a delightful mix of the weird and the wonderful, with a few pensive moments here and there. So many things that Ed does are ordinary (view spoiler) [like buying an ice-cream for a young mother (hide spoiler) ] , yet they tug at your heartstrings in a way that's extraordinary. The writing is... amazing . I don\u2019t know how to describe it, except call it beautiful. Her voice is so sweet it\u2019s almost ridiculous. It\u2019s like strawberry-flavored or something, that voice. The sentence lands between us like a ball with no air in it. My heart applauds inside my ears, first like a roaring crowd, then slows and slows until it\u2019s a solitary person, clapping with unbridled sarcasm. I also fear that nothing really ends at the end. Things just keep going as long as memory can wield its ax, always finding a soft part in your mind to cut through and enter. My voice is like a rumor. I\u2019m not quite sure if it came out or not or if it\u2019s true. The way the book ends...it\u2019s unconventional, to say the least. It catches you off-guard and takes its own sweet time to really sink in. But God, I loved it!! I think it\u2019s the kind of ending that only a genius like Markus Zusak could come up with. Delightful. Inventive. Beautiful. This book makes me believe that maybe, I too can live beyond what I'm capable of :) ...more 3.5 /5 stars \"Sometimes people are beautiful. Not in looks.

Sexual midget. Pathetic cardplayer. And now weird-shit magnet on top of it. Admit it. It's not a bad list I'm building up.\" I don't know what it is about his books that make me feel so many things, but damn. Damn. \"I got hearts, and for some reason, this feels the most dangerous of them all. People die of broken hearts. They have heart attacks. And it's the heart that hurts most when things go wrong and fall apart.\" I have a love-hate relationship with the ending. It makes sense, but I was disappointed in how it all wrapped up. Honestly, when I finished the book, I threw it down onto my bed, and left the room. I understand why Zusak ended it the way he did, and I didn't entirely hate it, but I just wanted more . More of an explanation, more of a conclusion. I probably would've given this a solid four stars, had that had happened. I would still recommend this book, regardless of the little things I disliked. It's book that should be read because of its message. \"'You are the epitome of ordinariness, Ed.' He looks at me seriously. 'And if a guy like you can stand up and do what you did for all those people, well, maybe everyone can.' He becomes intense now. Emotional. This is everything.

Do not go into this expecting it to be like The Book Thief, the two books are nothing alike and you will be disappointed. For those with an open mind however, I believe this book has quite a lot to say. The premise of the book intrigued me. We have Ed Kennedy, an ordinary 19-year-old guy who finds himself in the middle of a bank robbery along with his three best friends. After the incident his life changes dramatically when Ed finds a mysterious playing card in his letter box with three addresses on it. From here on out, Ed acts as a messenger, delivering to each and every person on the playing card what they need. The novel starts off with one of the best first chapters I have ever read: the bank robbery. That scene was hilarious, full of intrigue and made me curious as to what the rest of the novel would bring. Unfortunately, the book never again reached that high mark of suspense but it was entertaining nonetheless . One of the best things about the story for me was Ed. I loved him as a main character. Some might find him a little too self-deprecating to be likable but I personally could empathize with him so much. I felt his pain and understood what he was going through. He is ordinary, average, has no special talents, no great ambitions, no grand accomplishments. At 19, he believes that he has already come as far as he can go. While people around him do great things and have awesome jobs, his life has come to a stop. He is just living, never really changing. Fortunately, the story isn\u2019t about Ed feeling sorry for himself, instead, it\u2019s about his growth . Seeing the confidence he gained with every delivered message was beautiful and I loved following his development throughout the story. I also liked the other character and their relationships with one another. The scenes that featured Marv, Ritchie, Audrey and Ed together were my favorites. Some well-established, realistic friendships there that made me laugh out loud more than once. Both Marv and Ritchie were complex and fleshed out, Audrey less so. In fact, she may have been my least character in the story. And then there was the Doorman (Ed\u2019s dog); he was awesome. The way Zusak made him a real character within the novel was fantastic. The one relationship I wasn\u2019t a big fan of was the romance . It was very tame, almost bland and just did nothing for me (this may very well be due to the fact that I didn\u2019t like the love interest). I don\u2019t think it was superfluous, but it didn\u2019t really add anything to the story either. Ultimately, I think the reason you should read this book, the reason I recommend it, is its message. Sometimes we all need a reminder that anyone, no matter how ordinary you think you are, can do something extraordinary. Every one of us can do something to help another person as long as we believe we can. Additionally, there are also some beautiful quotes in here that I want everyone to read. It's not a big thing, but I guess it's true--big things are often just small things that are noticed. And this Sometimes people are beautiful. Not in looks. Not in what they say. Just in what they are. I mean wow, I want to frame that last one and hang it on my wall. I did have a few issues with the story. I felt that the middle part of the novel, the actual message delivering, didn\u2019t captivate as much as I would have liked . I\u2019m not sure why that was but I think the idea could have been executed better. Then there was the writing, which I had some conflicting feelings about. Zusak does this thing where he sometimes spaces out sentences and makes them into an entire paragraph. This can be an effective literary device, however, I felt that it was overused and the fact that it was always employed when something meaningful was said felt very in-my-face \u201cthis is important\u201d. I prefer books to be more subtle. Then there was the ending which frankly I didn\u2019t enjoy a whole lot . It wasn\u2019t predictable, but it felt a little like a cop-out. It didn\u2019t ruin the book for me or anything but I wish that the mystery aspect would have been more elaborate, better developed. One last remark that I want to mention is the question of righteousness . In the story, Ed does various things to deliver the messages that will in the end up bettering peoples\u2019 lives, bettering humanity. My issue does not concern the \u201cpositive\u201d acts but the once in which he employs violence. Whenever something like this happens in a story, I just find myself questioning what is right and wrong. Because who are we to decide what message needs delivering? Who are we to decide how someone else should live? Who are we to pass judgment? Of course the results in the novel are purely positive, but I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if what Ed was doing really was the best course of action. Despite my complaints I still recommend this book. It\u2019s not the most engaging story in the world but the characters kept me hooked nonetheless and the message is truly worth it. ...more Ubacujem moj review sa jednog drugog mesta... :D Ne zamerite :D U\u010diniti pravu stvar za ljude koje ne znamo nije laka stvar, a jo\u0161 je te\u017ee to uraditi za one koje volimo i za sebe.

(Although it does have Markus Zusak's style and wording, which I love.) At the end of the day I didn't love this book, but I think it's a piece of honesty. And that I like. It's about Ed, who is a low-life, basically, and achieves nothing. He gets sent mysterious playing cards with names on it and he has to solve the clues and figure out the message he needs to take to the names. BUT WHY?!! I am a very logical and give-me-the-black-and-white-answer person, which is probably my biggest downfall with this book. I guess what drove Ed to follow the messages is a craving (even though he ignores it) of a meaningful existence. But the plot was so airy and built on \"well, he just did\" that I kind of lost it. I didn't much like Ed. I didn't understand why he was doing these weird messages. I didn't like Ed's huge HUGE hangup about how he was not-good-at-sex. He only mentioned it 193814 times. I didn't like the first 60% But after that? I kind of was invested. There are a lot of characters, a lot of stops. (It kind of reminded me of Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close sometimes.) It's an journey about character development. It's about changing. It's pretty odd and a lot quirky and quite a bit Australian, which is refreshing. (Love me some Aussie books. I loved the writing style. The short sentences and the sass and the arguing and the ugly rotten dog (um, btw, I think feeding your dog only coffee and ice cream and lasagne will KILL IT. Just so you know.) And it's about friendship and love. SO YEAH. It's a good book, but it's not one I'd pick up on a whim. Not so much my style? I think, it's pretty crucial to read this book because IT'S A BOOK and not because it might be another The Book Thief. (Because it's not.)

Also, how everyone is not just another somebody. Everything we do, will have a direct or indirect effect to those people around us. This was a lesson Ed (the main character) learned. THE STORY The story follows Ed, who was an underage cab driver, until he becomes a hero. He became a local hero after he accidentally stops the robber when he was trying to escape. After the said incident, he received the first ace on his mail. With that was instructions, or more of addresses of places he should go. What they were for, he had no clue. He only started to get what the sender wants him to do, after he visted the first house. Ed becomes the messenger. But he was sure, that whoever sent him these aces made a mistake of choosing him. He doesn't believe he could help the people he was sent to help. He doesn't believe he could, because he couldn't even help himself. But there was no mistake, he was the right man for the job... The question was... Who sent them? MEET THE CHARACTERS There a lot of supporting characters here, but I think I'll be focusing on the main ones in my opinion. Ed \u201cMy full name\u2019s Ed Kennedy. I\u2019m nineteen. I\u2019m an underage cabdriver. I\u2019m typical of many of the young men you see in this suburban outpost of the city\u2014not a whole lot of prospects or possibility. That aside, I read more books than I should, and I\u2019m decidedly crap at sex and doing my taxes. Nice to meet you.\u201d Ed was not your typical hero. He wasn't the brooding or panty-dropping type that are mostly on YA and NA books. He was plain. He was ordinary. And he knows that. He hasn't done anything remarkable in his life... until now. I think Mr. Zusak's characterization of Ed was brilliant. You see him grow throughout the book. You see him struggle. You see him start to see the world with new eyes. It was beautiful. I see why he chose a character like Ed to portray the main role. He wanted to show his readers that you don't have to be somebody to make a difference. You don't have to be rich, you don't have to be a successful person, you don't have to be popular - you just have to be the person who wants to make a difference. And as the story unfolds itself, you will see that difference with Ed and to those people whose life he touched. Ed's voice was honest. You'll read about him feeling bad about himself not being able to do anything right - which I think most of us could relate to. The Sender Oh boy. He was definitely a big surprise. My mouth was hanging open. I could not believe what Mr. Zusak did with him. You only meet the sender towards the end of the book. You'll meet him, but you'll have to guess who he is. At first, it would be unclear, because you've never met him. But as you go and read everthing he has to say, you'll see what I mean. \"And if a guy like you can stand up and do what you did for all those people, well, maybe everyone can. Maybe everyone can live beyond what they're capable of.\". For me, this line right there, was the best lesson I got from this book. Towards the end, you'll realize that he made Ed the message, not the messenger. We are not just a somebody, we are all a someone. I hope that made sense. We may think that what we do, are insignificant to someone else, but that's not true. We could affect other people's lives, for the better or for the worse, it is out choice. We have to make that choice. FINAL THOUGHTS This book is one I will highly recommend to everyone. I know I didn't rate it a perfect 5, because of some reasons. Like there were times that I got bored, that I got upset with some of Ed's thoughts... and a bunch of other stuff... but those are very minor things. Not even worth mentioning really. I know it's silly but, I can't rate a book a perfect 5 if there were some things I didn't like about it. So there. Hence, the 4 stars. However, the message of this book, was so pure. Believe in what you can do. This book is an encouragement, for those people who are losing hope, for those who feel their life is going nowhere, for those who thinks their stuck on where they are, for those who feel that they couldn't help others because they couldn't even help themselves. Ed was the perfect example of how this is not true. I did tear up a little bit towards the end. For those of you who have been following my reviews, I am a real cry baby when it comes to books like these. It's not overly emotional, but because I could relate to most parts of the book, it pulled a few heartstrings. I felt the sincerity of Mr. Zusak words. I feel that for the author, the message that he wants to convey is more important than the fame or money he will be receiving if this book becomes popular. I couldn't stress enough, how much I love and adore this book. I would recommend it to anyone who are looking for a read that will leave you thinking about life, reality, yourself, others, and a bunch of other things in between. Will definitely be looking forward for more of Mr. Zusak's books. ...more Maybe I'm allergic to Markus Zusak's writing?

Clearly the author has amazing talent, he wrote this one just prior to the Book Thief. I got straight into this book. I love when this happens, and it\u2019s usually when I am reading a few books at a time and then something comes along and blows the others out of the water. I read a few reviews on GR and it seems that the Aussie readers are generally rating this one higher on the stars, and I know that one of the reasons is because of the ockerisms, they are really fantastic and they made me a tad homesick. Throughout the book I could hear the Strayan accent which I love and don\u2019t hear a lot any more. Ed Kennedy is still in the suburb where he grew up, driving a cab and doesn't have much ambition. At the end of the book he is still in the suburb that he grew up in, driving and cab but he is a completely different person. He is the person that was always there, deep down struggling under the weight of all that ordinariness. Highly recommend this funny and touching story. I dropped one star as I'm a bit of a skeptic and I was doubtful that this can happen in real life. ...more I buddy read this with Chantal (click for her review). 3.5 out of 5 stars Meet Ed Kennedy: My full name\u2019s Ed Kennedy.

Soon after, he gets on the mail a card \u2013 an ace of diamonds \u2013 with a message on it, and he has to deliver each of them to certain people who need his help (but they don't know they need it, and neither does Ed know it's him they need). I didn't know what to expect when I started this book. I had high hopes because of The Book Thief , which, just as the majority of the people, I loved. I knew they were completely different (and they indeed are), but I still expected to be blown. You cannot imagine my joy when I ended up enjoying this \u2013 not as much as The Book Thief , but I still liked this well enough. I had so much fun reading this book. It's filled with sarcastic and witty comments. There were some times where I couldn't contain my laugh. It also tended to be a little satirical at some points, but it was always funny. Have a look at some quotes: \u201cHow does this sort of thing always seem to happen to you, Ed? If there\u2019s anything weird floating around, it always manages to land on you . You\u2019re like a weird-shit magnet.\u201d \u201cBusiness no good lately?\u201d I ask. \u201cThe truth?\u201d The glass in his eyes breaks and punctures me. \u201cShithouse.\u201d That\u2019s when I have to ask him. \u201cCan you really talk like that? Being holy and all?\u201d \u201cWhat? Because I\u2019m a priest?\u201d He finishes the dregs of his coffee. \u201cSure. God knows what\u2019s important.\u201d This book is not only good for a laugh, though. It also contains a beautiful message that I kind of liked. It's not too profound, but it's great, and I made this book feel more special. Sometimes people are beautiful. Not in looks. Not in what they say. Just in what they are. In first instance, I thought I was going to dislike Ed. Why? Simple: He seemed too oh-woe-is-me. Before I even mention me, I should tell you some other facts: 1. At nineteen, Bob Dylan was a seasoned performer in Greenwich Village, New York. 2. Salvador Dal\u00ed had already produced several outstanding artworks of paint and rebellion by the time he was nineteen. 3. Joan of Arc was the most wanted woman in the world at nineteen, having created a revolution. Then there\u2019s Ed Kennedy, also nineteen\u2026. Just prior to the bank holdup, I\u2019d been taking stock of my life. Cabdriver\u2014and I\u2019d funked my age at that. (You need to be twenty.) No real career. No respect in the community. Nothing. See that quote? I thought the entire book was going to be Ed feeling sorry for himself. I thought he was a Gary Stu. Gratefully, he wasn't. He reads more like a flawed, realistic and totally ordinary guy, and I liked him. It's easier, in my opinion, to relate to non-perfect characters, because really, who is perfect? I liked the other characters and the relationships between them as well. There were some cute friendships, and other were hilarious. For example, whenever Marv, Ritchie, Audrey and Ed were together I couldn't stop laughing. There's also a great relationship between a dog \u2013 the Doorman (and yeah, that's his real name) \u2013 and Ed, which I loved. The writing, however, could have been better. Don't get me wrong \u2013 it's not bad. I had a love/hate relationship with it. For once, it's beautiful: It feels like poetry at some points without getting to purple prose. Buuut, I am not a fan of one-sentenced paragraphs. Imagine this: You're on a highway and the car is going fast, then you push the brakes. You accelerate again, just to push the brakes as soon as you do that, and keep on doing it. That's how it feels reading paragraphs like that. I could forgive that, but there was something that bothered me, and it's this: I at least deserve something , I reason. Audrey could love me just for a second, surely. But I know. Without doubt, I know nothing will happen. She won\u2019t kiss me. She\u2019ll barely touch me. I\u2019m running all over town, getting trodden on, beaten up, abused, and for what? What do I get out of it? What\u2019s in it for Ed Kennedy? Audrey is Ed's best-friend since childhood, and he is madly in love with her. That's no problem. The problem was that he thinks he deserves to have sex with Audrey just because he \u201cwas chosen\u201d to do the dirty work. I agree with Lyn on this: That's rape culture, and that aspect alone prevented me from rating this 4 stars. I wasn\u2019t a great fan of the ending as well. It was not predictable, but I wasn\u2019t satisfied with it. I mean\u2026 without spoilers, I can say it wasn\u2019t in the least what I expected and it kind of ruined some great things in the book. I don\u2019t know. There is another thing I must mention before I end this review: There is a rape scene. It\u2019s short and not too graphic, but that can make some readers feel uncomfortable. Gladly, rape is addressed in a correct way that I actually liked reading about. Nonetheless, I still cannot go without recommending this, because I did like it. The plot was intriguing enough to keep me hooked, I loved the characters and the dynamics between them, and I loved the message this book leaves. However, take into account the big complaint I had because it can ruin your experience. ...more Z, is for Zusak 3.5 Stars I didn't know words could be so heavy. Some writers use words like water in a garden, liberally and freely, while others use them with a sparing grace; concise and to the point. For me, Zusak falls in that second category. He has a talent for infusing his simple prose with more power than the words themselves own. I respect that, I respect that a whole lot. That isn\u2019t to say I don\u2019t enjoy some more wordy writing, that would be a lie, but I have a whole different level of Z, is for Zusak 3.5 Stars I didn't know words could be so heavy.

I Am the Messenger is about Ed Kennedy, the most unlikely of heroes. Ed Kennedy is a nobody, an underachiever so to speak, who surprises everyone by stopping a bank robber one day. After that day, Ed\u2019s life will never be quite the same. He starts getting coded playing cards, leading him all over his rural town and into places and situations he would never have gone on his own. It\u2019s all aces doing what needs to be done, right? What could possibly go wrong? Besides, y\u2019know, everything \u2026.. Some of the places he goes are beautifully sad, some truly horrifying and others mildly depressing; but all of them show him something. Something he was blinded to before the cards started arriving. The thing is that we can all be blind, even with those we are closest to, as to what is going on underneath the surface. It takes effort to look inside another person\u2019s situation, and Ed is finally starting to learn a vital lesson about the world: I'm just another stupid human. ...more Initial Final Page Thoughts.

I am still undecided about whether I liked Ed, I\u2019ll discuss this more in the hero section. Even though the whole idea of the book was fantastic and so original, I hate to say it failed in the execution. Whether it was just me, I\u2019m not sure, but I have NO idea what the ending was all about or\u2026 actually, what the whole \u2018message\u2019 of the book was all about. Also, the logistics are absolutely ridiculous. I mean, I don\u2019t mind suspending my disbelief\u2026 but if I was going to suspend my disbelief for this book I\u2019d probably need a crane. Also, the love story. YAWN. Hero. OK, I loved Ed at first. He was sarcastic, funny, self-deprecating and he ticked all my boxes (yeah I fancied him). But as the book went on I found it more and more difficult to sympathise with him. He was one of those characters that are ridiculously slow at getting the gist of things and you just want to reach in and shake them by the collar and be like \u2018WHY DON\u2019T YOU GET WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING YET?!\u2019 I know there has to be an element of cluelessness in books like this so the author can develop the story properly\u2026 but this was silly. I don\u2019t want to end on a negative tone so I will say a few things about what I liked about Ed. He treated The Doorman, aka the second best dog in literature (Manchee still has my heart), with the respect he warranted. He did deal with crazy men in balaclavas turning up in house very bravely. He likes Bob Dylan. He was very sweet when it came to some of the messages, particularly Sophie, Angie, Marv and the Tatupu. Oh, and I\u2019m always fascinated by people who can play cards without inadvertently launching into a game of 52 card pick-up. Seriously, I can't even play Snap. Love Interests. I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll continue saying it until all the authors in the universe heed my infinite wisdom: A book does NOT need a love interest to be a good book. Yes, I love it when authors bring the swoon. But only when it either adds something to the story or aids the development of a character. A romance shouldn\u2019t just be thrown in as an afterthought. I couldn\u2019t get behind Audrey and Ed because it seemed really forced and rushed. Also, Audrey was kind of a tease. Even though she has good taste in films\u2026 Best Friends. I loved Marv and Richie. One of my greatest weakness in life (I do have a few) is a boy who defends his run-down car to the death, so Marv and his blue Falcon was like cat nip to me. So many of Marv and Ed\u2019s exchanges made me laugh so loudly and I could just imagine boys their age talking like that. But my Marv keeps his cards close to his chest, I don\u2019t want to give anything away but Marv\u2019s message was my favourite part of the whole book. It came at the point in the book where I had pretty much written it off, so I was completely surprised when I found myself being a bit choked up! I also really liked Richie but I just wished he had been in it a bit more because I think his story line was great. I also LOVED that he had a Jimi Hendrix tattoo on his arm... that looked like Richard Pryor. Hahaaa. I love authors that don\u2019t just let their secondary characters stand around in the background, leaning against the wall and having a cigarette break. Theme Tune. Shape of my Heart- Sting. I don't mind admitting that I love a good metaphor but I feel like I was cheated a little on that front by this book, so I\u2019ve chosen a song brimming with metaphor. And it\u2019s all linked to card suits as well! It's like it was written for this very moment. Recommended For. People who haven\u2019t read The Book Thief\u2026 your high expectations will be dashed. DASHED I SAY. People who play cards.

Ed thinks he's destined to be another nothing of the city, until he finds the first card in his mailbox... It's the Ace of Diamonds, and on it are written three addresses. Someone wants Ed to help the people who live there, or else. The rest of the book focuses on Ed's mission \"to help or to hurt\", and deliver the messages. Ed's witty voice keeps the situations mostly light, although the book plunges into darkness frequently. I'm a bit ashamed to say that I didn't get the ending of this book the first time I read it. I wasn't expecting it, and for some reason, my mind wouldn't make the connection between the author and the character. But it is truly a brilliant twist, one that gives me further reassurance that Markus Zusak is the most pivotal YA author of our times. ...more If you pass your mouse over the star choices, 1 star reads \"did not like it\"!

Hopefully, by explaining my reaction others will be better able to decide if they will like the book or not. Life isn't as simple or as sweet as it is drawn here. This is my primary complaint in a nutshell. I must clarify; the message is sweet and simplified, even if some of the book\u2019s events are quite disturbing. This book teaches a lesson. And what is that? People should live life to the fullest. Appreciate it. Enjoy it. Do something with it. We mustn't be complacent. We mustn't be bystanders. We must dare to put ourselves out on a limb for others. Of course I agree, and of course we all tend to forget. I am not debating the truth of the message but rather the way in which the message is conveyed. It is this that is childish. I am fine with giving the book to young adults, but I prefer gritty over sweet and I don't appreciate simplification. The characters are around nineteen or twenty years old. I felt they acted even younger, but had they been younger two of them could not have driven taxis as they do here in the story. Do you remember the allure, the appeal of sex when you were a teen? Again, it is for this age group the book is directed. Both the ending and the entire book is unrealistic, concocted and too simplified making it childish in tone. The story is drawn as a mystery. The things that happen just would not happen! I would recommend the book to young teenagers not looking for realism, who love mysteries and a dash of romance. The audiobook is narrated by Australian Marc Aden Gray. The story is set in the vicinity of Sydney in the year 2002. While the dialect does fit the story it just didn\u2019t appeal to me. Australian slang is used. Keep in mind I do not let the narration influence my rating of the book. I gave the narration two stars. I have given the author's The Book Thief 4 stars. ...more In reading this book, there were times I teared up. Nothing sad, just the power of Zusak's words.
