Everytime the Grandmother speaks she calls Zoey the Cherokee word for daughter and every single time the author explains that the word makes her feel safe. There is a whole lot of explaining and back story and description and really not a whole lot of story, plot, character development or emotion. It's a good story idea, but not very well executed. Also, has anyone ever noticed that Zoey falls in love/lust with any cute single guy that walks into her path?

A new character, Stark, is introduced, but his part is just too short in this book, so I'm hoping there will be more to come of him in the future books. Neferet has truly gone evil and Aphrodite is, gasp, nice! I finally like Aphrodite and am happy to read about her snobby self without wanting to smack her. Zoey's Grandma comes to stay at The House of Night and it is easy to feel the love all of the fledglings feel towards this woman. The Cast's did a wonderful job of weaving Cherokee stories into the book for both background purposes and featuring the tales up front and center. The novel is a quick read because it's just so hard to put it down. The book comes to a close in the midst of the action and you are left unaware of what's happened to some of the characters outside of the main group of friends. It is the biggest cliffhanger of the series thus far, leaving us waiting to find out how Zoey will save the world. ...more I TOTALLY NEED TO VENT AT THE STUPIDITY/IDIOCY/AND OBVIOUS MENTAL ISSUES OF THE MAIN CHARACTER.

LIKE REALLY, HAVE YOU NO SHAME OR BRAINS. THUS, THIS STUPID PARAGRAPH GETS ON MY NERVES. 'Erik looked at me. His blue eyes were absolutely expressionless, which felt completely wrong. Those same eyes had shown me happiness and passion and warmth and even the beginnings of love. Then they'd shown me hurt and anger. And now they showed me nothing at all? How could that even be possible?' Um Zoey, its possible ur a ____. And thus for now, at this part, im rating this book a solid 1. AND this book will strike all time lows if Eric somehow forgives her and gets back with Zoey again. Cause that is utterly unrealistic and impossible. Eriks cruel attitude toward Zoey better keep up since this makes me actually like him as a character in this lame book for as before i was wondering and tbh still wondering why he's in this book at all. UPDATE: THIS GIRL TAKES BEING A ** TO A WHOLE NOTHER LEVEL. Tell me how she cheats and makes out with her ex-boyfriend, while in a relationship with another boy, and despite that manages to have sex with a teacher all in the same 2 month time span. THEN, IF THAT WASNT THE WORST OF IT. 2 days after her lover teacher died, she didnt hesitate and give herself time to recover. She lays a big one on a random boy who was in the process of DYING. WTH. this book is steadily getting on my last nerves. ...more Ok, so I really hated the last book and I told myself I wasn't going to read anymore of this series, but I came across a cheap electronic version and I couldn't help myself. I am glad I did. This book was so much better than the previous ones, my only two complaints are: 1. too short!! and 2. I know this is targeted towards a young audience, but come on, does Zoe really need multiple love interests in every book!!!? And to make it worse, does she really have to fall \"head over heels\" for EVERY g Ok, so I really hated the last book and I told myself I wasn't going to read anymore of this series, but I came across a cheap electronic version and I couldn't help myself.

I know this is targeted towards a young audience, but come on, does Zoe really need multiple love interests in every book!!!? And to make it worse, does she really have to fall \"head over heels\" for EVERY guy that shows even remote interest? Ugh, it drives me crazy when a strong and otherwise independent heroine seems to need male attention 24/7 to feel worthwhile. Once again, I am not some feminist-nazi-men-hater, I love romance. I think it's great, but when it seems that it is only thrown in to keep readers interested and appeased, it really kills it for me. If not for complaint number two, I probably would have given it one more star. I enjoyed the way Zoe and friends learned the importance of forgiveness. I especially enjoyed seeing the \"geek squad\" learn to be a little less self-centered and realize that the world does not revolve around them (trust me, I was well into my twenties when that idea finally started to dawn on me. Not that I have mastered it yet, either). They finally understood why Zoe had to do things the way she did and they even felt a bit ashamed for their selfish reaction and unwillingness to see things from her perspective. I also loved the way this book brought in beliefs and traditions from different cultures and faiths. I also enjoyed seeing Zoe realize that there is bad and good in all groups (not all Christians are bad, not all vampyres are loyal to their goddess, etc.) ...more take beside the fact that Zoey is definitely a (sorry) ho, P.C Cast had created a great book. I love that the story has something to do with legends and myths, really i found the idea with Kalona really impressing. And maybe because i am a teenager i just adore the easy-going writing style. Those are some plus points. Even if i gave the book 5 star rating that doesnt mean the book was flawless. I am 15 years old and i had a boyfriend, i know how it felt like to be between handsome men, but still i take beside the fact that Zoey is definitely a (sorry) ho, P.C Cast had created a great book.

Those are some plus points. Even if i gave the book 5 star rating that doesnt mean the book was flawless. I am 15 years old and i had a boyfriend, i know how it felt like to be between handsome men, but still i doubt Zoey is normal. My first impression: 1. Zoey is a TOO nice girl 2. Zoey is freakishly shallow 3. Zoey is over hyperactive aggressive and has no women's pride 4. Zoey has issue/hyper sex/whatever Why cant she just break up the imprint with Heath? Why couldn't she think clearly before fooling around with Heath? Why Heath why? (I never like Heath) Obviously, i was very glad that Zoey may had something with Stark. Maybe the reason i gave untamed 5 star is because there were less love thingie, not like in Chosen (i thought i would puke because Zoey was definitely shallow). This book was totally focused on the real issue and i found it very pleasant. This is the best book of the other four. And please, please, Zoey must not be so perfect. Its too cliche. Zoey is the wrong hero. I like Aphrodite more, even the names too cheesy. Throw Zoey, and all her boyfriend to the trash bin then i would give untamed 7-star. sorry for stupid grammar and spelling mistakes, i am still learning. ...more \u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf

What I do blame her for is not immediately distancing herself from Loren as soon as it became clear his intentions were inappropriate! I mean, he's a teacher, for one, but for Pete's sake, Zoey had a boyfriend! Okay, I enjoyed this book like the others, but I had a couple of issues with it: 1. Yes, Zoey is beating herself up for falling for Loren's crap in book 3. Honestly, I don't really fault her for falling for it\u2014anyone would be susceptible to flattery and romance, especially a teenage girl. What I do blame her for is not immediately distancing herself from Loren as soon as it became clear his intentions were inappropriate! I mean, he's a teacher, for one, but for Pete's sake, Zoey had a boyfriend! A boyfriend she was already semi-cheating on with Heath, though that was almost a compulsion and at least she'd been fairly up front with Erik that Something Was Going On in that department. But the Loren thing... she never seems to understand that her error wasn't in falling for the deceit, but in participating in the relationship AT ALL. I hated that all through book 3 she kept referring to Erik, Heath and Loren as her \"three boyfriends.\" Auuugh. Then she has the nerve, when finally talking to Erik about things, to act like he should be apologizing to her because he reacted without having the whole story (Loren's true reasons for seducing her, etc.).... yes, he reacted strongly, no, he probably shouldn't have basically called her a slut in front of all her friends, but.... YOU SLEPT WITH ERIK'S MENTOR, WHILE YOU WERE STILL SUPPOSEDLY DATING ERIK, NOT TO MENTION WHILE ALSO MESSING AROUND WITH YOUR PREVIOUS BOYFRIEND. I cannot honestly fault Erik for his behavior, jerky as it might have been. Erik has a lot to forgive, and sure I'm glad they seem to have resolved it enough to be talking and on the same side again, but Zoey just never seems to \"get\" what was wrong about the whole situation, and that really irked me. And then she goes and starts thinking Stark is her soul mate after talking to him for ten minutes. COME ON, ZOEY. You don't have to fall in lurrrrv/lust with every male who looks your direction, really. It's not necessary to the plot (well, it's possible a reason will be provided for the Stark think in book 5, but... still. Kinda ridiculous...). 2. I cannot believe I am saying this, but I almost think the ending would have been better if Stevie Rae had turned out to have more involvement in the Kalona resurrection than as target practice for Stark. I am weirded out that she said \"he's taken my blood but not my life,\" and will be looking for a bit more of an explanation of that... plus with all the heavy hinting about Stevie Rae not being as back to normal as Zoey tries to pretend, I was sort of expecting her to ... I dunno. Be more evil. Normally I'm really a happy ending kind of girl, so I'm not sure why I would WANT Stevie Rae to be evil... I like her and I'm glad she didn't die, but... it just seemed like the story would have been stronger that way. *shrug* Oh well, we'll see what book 5 has in store. ...more It's a good thing these teen vampire dramas take only a couple of hours to read.

It's a good think I'm not in a terrible marriage, right, I'd be here till the end waiting to see if it got better. It's usually not such a bad thing -- I'm a fast reader. Even if the book produces much mouth vomit, I only have to spit and rinse for a few days. However, these series books, man alive, they're a bit of a problem. Thankfully, there's only one more book in the House of Night series, and I know the chances are slim that it's going to make make it all worth it, but I've gotta try. To be honest, it's not the storyline, or characters, that turn my stomach, it's the condescending tone and the judgemental stereotypes. It's like a PSA in Utah or the 1950s. I know your writing a teen book (mostly for girls) so you might think it's a good time to give a few lessons on how to be an upstanding, moral teen, but it's not -- your teenage vampire book is not the right platform to tell us only losers smoke pot or drink, druggies are losers (always), only desperate girls give blowjobs, girls that give blowjobs are being used, only a slut would kiss her boyfriend out in the open like that, goths smell bad and don't bathe enough. And if you can't help but pass on these nuggets of wisdom, don't hit us on the head with them, give us some layers, lady! Seriously, I'm not sure who reads and enjoys these books considering that the authors succeed in alienating every 'type' of teenager except the most middle-mundane-average-boring one, which might cover, like two actual kids in the world. Geez. Aside from all of that, well, I don't know, it was hard to get past all of that.

Does anybody else find this character just a tad bit, oh I don't know... hypacritical ?! ...more OK. So this book is horribly written. It seems a 12 yo wrote it. I think the other books in this series are pretty good and I was so excited when I ordered it from my local bookstore. I read the first 3 pages and almost throw up. I really don't want to finish the book at all. I understand that the authors of this book are not the best but they could have done a much better job writing this book. So when we last left Zoey, Erik had mercilessly slut-shamed Zoey until her friends abandoned her, Loren had died, and Neferet was evilly declaring war against humans for those murders that she totally didn\u2019t do.

Untamed picks up like a day or two later, with Zoey sulking because her friends are angry at her for not telling them things I can\u2019t be fucked to remember. I think it was about Stevie Rae? Also possibly Loren? Anyway, the vital part is that Zoey\u2019s adrift with only Aphrodite as an ally, which makes her more vulnerable than usual, because of reasons. Luckily this lasts all of two seconds before Aphrodite bullies Zoey\u2019s friends into not being mad at her anymore, because god forbid things have consequences. SPOILERS ABOUND YO Meanwhile, Shekinah, High Priestess and Only Other Black Vampire in the World Besides Shaunee, visits the campus, to put the kibosh on Neferet\u2019s holy war, and insist that the human police be allowed to investigate those murders that she totally didn\u2019t commit. Zoey suggests that cop she worked with like two books ago that nobody remembers, and the matter is settled. Neferet is real pissed, and she stomps all around the place like a spoiled child, making it even more mystifying that anyone would believe she doesn\u2019t have her own fucking agenda. But nah, nothing suspicious going on here, nope. Meanwhile meanwhile, Zoey spends one night volunteering at at cat shelter run by some weirdly open-minded nuns. Ostensibly she's working with this nun-run charity to \u201cbetter integrate with the community\u201d and get an opportunity to talk to Stevie Rae off school grounds, but mostly it\u2019s so that Zoey can know these characters\u2019 names when she summons and imposes her needs on them like two days later. Seriously she\u2019s met this particular nun, Mary Angela, once for like an hour before she fucking summons her to the hospital after her grandmother is injured in a car accident. Zoey doesn\u2019t feel comfortable leaving her grandmother alone, so she calls this woman to babysit her unconscious body, and of course the nun does it, with a smile on her face, because Zoey is Zoey, and everyone loves, believes, and trusts Zoey implicitly, unless they\u2019re the bad guys. Meanwhile meanwhile meanwhile James fucking Stark, aka motivator number two for continuing with this re-read, rolls into town. Stark is another speshul snowflake set up to join Zoey\u2019s harem of complete tools, and since Cast has run out of elements, he gets the Goddess-given gift of infinite Patriot Arrows. It\u2019s the doinkiest fucking thing you guys, he can literally fire an arrow into the sky and it will Looney Toons its way right into whatever he\u2019s thinking about, even if what he\u2019s thinking about isn\u2019t literally what he\u2019s thinking about. Like, he tells this story about how he tried to hit \u201cthe heart of a tree\u201d, meaning right in the dead center I guess, but instead he hits an owl, which according to some rando folklore he cites, was the true \u201cheart of the tree\u201d. It\u2019s the most gloriously absurd fucking thing. Stark comes complete with his own dark and tragic Falcon Story, which he spills to Zoey after knowing her for approximately twenty seconds. Thanks to his terrible, terrible curse of shooting really accurately, he accidentally killed his best friend/mentor in the Vampire Olympics, and now he refuses to ever participate in competitive archery ever again! But! There\u2019s a catch! THAT'S RIGHT, he gets archery BLUE BALLS, you guys. Unf, if he can\u2019t shoot it off, it just hurts him SO BAD! And he\u2019s such a tragic, tormented figure, he can\u2019t stand the pain of not shooting his arrows off, so he does it anyway, even though he feels real bad about it after. In case you guys didn\u2019t get it, he\u2019s a real mysterious, tortured bad boy. Anyway, Stark spends approximately ten minutes confessing his Sady McSadface backstory to Zoey, before promptly dying in one of the most appallingly awful scenes in the series so far, in that, while it's happening, Stark makes it entirely about how ~sad~ he is, not that he's dying, but because it means he can't get to know Zoey better. How fucking horrifyingly narcissistic is this, to have this character come, meet the heroine briefly, and then spend his dying moments lamenting not getting to know her better? How horrifying is it to make this character\u2019s last moments about how amazing the protagonist is? This fucking Zoey-centric world is a thing of nightmares. I imagine that Zoey is some sort of Haruhi Suzumiya god-like character who warps reality to suit her needs, and so this guy she thinks is hot spends his last moments on earth praising her beauty, while inside he\u2019s screaming like \u201cWHY AM I SAYING THESE THINGS? I DON\u2019T KNOW YOU, I\u2019M FUCKING DYING, PLEASE GET HELP!\u201d But nope, he dies, in the way that hot people that Zoey likes die, which is to say, he\u2019ll come back soon enough. But in the meantime, Zoey spends the book mentally lamenting his loss, and that connection they TOTALLY ESTABLISHED ten minutes before he died. Sure, you might think it\u2019s shitty writing that they only knew each other for ten minutes, but you know what? That\u2019s YOUR FAULT for having ridiculous social expectations about relationships, like that people take TIME to get to know one another before they decide that they\u2019re SOUL MATES. Which Zoey decides they are, by the way. She literally says that they might be soul mates. This is the darkest fucking timeline for this world, you guys. She spends the rest of the book eagerly anticipating his resurrection as a red fledgling, and his inevitable position as the fourth point on her Love Square, which has collapsed for the moment, but is back on the rise. Speaking of vertices, Erik is back as a teacher in this installment, and in the one class that Zoey actually attends, they have a wildly inappropriate moment in which he literally gets hard choking Zoey, she\u2019s super into it, and they make out in front of the entire class that he\u2019s teaching. We have to fucking talk about Zoey and her guys, because I just cannot stand the way this book handles that. So look, polyamory can be a thing, and I would almost be willing to- well, not praise, I could never praise House of Night, that\u2019s just not a thing I can physically do- but I could give it a modicum of credit for giving Zoey the agency to sustain multiple romantic relationships at once. EXCEPT for two things. A) oh jesus fucking Christ the double-standard slut-shaming, like how can you even justify that? No. And B) Zoey pursues all of these guys simultaneously without being honest with them. She does it in this very book! She thinks about Stark constantly, before, during, and after his death. She thinks about how much she wants to date him, can\u2019t wait to maybe pursue a thing between the two of them when he rises from the grave. But then she pursues Erik at the same time. Erik, who she KNOWS isn\u2019t interested in sharing her with another guy, who broke up with her for that very reason. But she just cannot fucking stand the idea that Erik might exist on the campus without being in love with her, so she goes out of her way to try and patch things up, get him back into her and on her side, while also tapping her foot, looking at her watch, waiting for Stark to revive. And you know what, I could even fucking deal with that if she and the book would just acknowledge how selfish she\u2019s being. But it\u2019s like when she\u2019s thinking of one, the other doesn\u2019t exist. NEVER THE TWO THOUGHTS SHALL MEET, NOPE. I just really can\u2019t handle Zoey\u2019s love life, I can\u2019t. I vaguely recall the later books going into some shit about how she, as a High Priestess, has multiple boy slots that she can fill, so they might all have the Talk at some point, I don\u2019t remember. But she needs to do some goddamn self-reflection like ASAP, this shit is getting old. Meanwhile^4, Aphrodite, human now but still psychic, has a vision about 100 pages from the end of the book that slaps down a new slab of plot that we\u2019ve never even heard of before. Yes, our foreshadowing prophecy, revealed, again, 100 pages before the end of the book. Aphrodite transcribes it from her vision in Zoey\u2019s grandmother\u2019s handwriting, so naturally Zoey calls for a consult, and Cast proceeds to exploit the characters\u2019 Cherokee heritage for that sweet, sweet Native American mysticism. Zoey\u2019s grandmother exposits the (from what I can tell), completely made-up-for-House-of-Night tale of Kalona, a fallen angel rapist and father of the Raven Mockers, actual creatures from Cherokee legend, who are half-bird, half-man in exactly the way you don\u2019t want. It\u2019s around this time that Untamed shoots for its most unexpected target \u2013 feminism. I almost shudder typing that word in this context, because it\u2019s so fucking laughable. I mean jesus, do you guys remember the man-hating straw feminists following Aphrodite around in the first book? Remember how Zoey calls like every single woman in this book some variation of slut, whore, or skank, especially if they disagree with her? Remember how this book others, exotifies, or tokenizes every single one of it\u2019s women of color? Remember how there was one line about goddess-worshipping lesbians and that\u2019s it? Remember the fucking ridiculously rigid women-priestesses, men-warriors gender roles? And yet House of Night wants to play the \u201cgirl power\u201d card by making its \u201cvillain\u201d a rapist defeated by a group of Cherokee medicine women, and shooting off cheeky little lines about how Kalona will be shocked to find that \u201ctoday\u2019s women are not so easy to subdue\u201d. I mean first, fuck you hard for that bit of casual victim blaming apparently applicable to the entirety of history/anyone else who was \u201ceasy to subdue\u201d. Even typing that, my blood fucking boils. I cannot handle how offhandedly cruel and insidious that statement is. Second, just, like, no, man. It\u2019s too late. We\u2019re four books in, and this one hasn\u2019t dispensed with any of its ugly misogyny, racism, homophobia, general hatefulness, or shitty world-building. You cannot salvage this story into one that\u2019s woman-positive. It\u2019s not fucking feminist if only one type of woman is deemed acceptable, and all others are shamed or erased. You can piss right fucking off with that shit. Ugh, anyway, Kalona and the terrible prophecy: they don\u2019t get it. Even with the help of Zoey\u2019s grandmother and Damian-My-Other-Character-Trait-Is-That-I\u2019m-Smart, they just can\u2019t suss it out. So the group attempts to interpret the prophecy to no avail, but hey, when all else fails, you know what\u2019s there to move the plot along? The Irritable Bowel Goddess. That\u2019s right, Zoe\u2019s Irritable Bowel Goddess ( term coined by Fangs ) is in full force, kicking in whenever Zoey has a stray thought that\u2019s relevant to the plot Neferet has orchestrated. It all culminates in an embarrassing mess of a climax that a baby could have seen coming. Love Square Vertice #4 (Stark) is resurrected from the dead to do the one thing that we\u2019ve been told he can do: shoot shit. That\u2019s literally the reason Neferet poached him from a rival House of Night. It\u2019s not even a very difficult shot to pull off, I guess like nobody else could be trusted to hit the broad side of a barn. He shoots Stevie Rae, because that fulfills the prophecy by making the representative of the (element) earth bleed, which none of Zoey\u2019s fucking walnuts managed to put together. Kalona rises, and Neferet instantly converts an entire campus full of goddess worshipers to hot-winged-rapist worshipers. She also kills the High Priestess of All Vampires without anyone noticing, bringing the number of black vampires in the world back down to one. Despite being fucking stared at the entire time, Zoey manages to disappear from the fray via the use of elements, which I like to picture as Neferet fixing her eyes on Zoey, and then suddenly there\u2019s a Zoey-shaped cloud of fog there instead, and Neferet\u2019s like \u201cFUCK, WHERE DID SHE GO?\u201d The Raven Mockers wreak havoc on the city, and Zoey guides a group of more than a dozen teenagers with stupid tattoos on their faces through downtown Tulsa on New Year\u2019s Eve without being noticed, not because of plot convenience, but because Nyx goddamn willed it, thank you very much. They hole up with Stevie Rae\u2019s Red Fledglings, do a team cheer, and Zoey levels up. And that\u2019s it. The end. So obviously there\u2019s a lot going on here. I guess you could say that Untamed is technically one of the better House of Night books purely by virtue of the fact that something relevant actually happens in it. Untamed moves the series plot forward in one giant, awkward lurch, making it one of like four House of Night books you actually have to read to keep abreast with what\u2019s going on. At the same time, this installment feels very transitional, and not much like a complete story in itself. There\u2019s a lot of abrupt set-up for things that are meant to occur later, particularly in the next book, Hunted. The introductions of Stark, the Benedictine nuns, and the prophecy are clumsy and clunky, and feel like last-minute additions that should have been set up books ago in order to pay off the way the Untamed wanted them to. I am actually genuinely curious to know how much of the series Cast had planned out in advance, because right now, this whole book feels like a last-minute swerve. But even with plot-related happenings, this is still a House of Night book, and it is still garbage. It\u2019s hateful, it\u2019s terribly written, lazily plotted, and the characters are all monstrous in ways the narrative refuses to acknowledge. I go through like a complete emotional cycle every time I read one of these things: first it\u2019s so bad it\u2019s painful, then you get used to the pain, and it\u2019s kind of enjoyably awful. But by the halfway mark you\u2019re wallowing in mind-numbing despair at how many fucking brain cells you\u2019re losing with every word you read, and once you finally make it to the end, you\u2019ve been begging for death for pages, just wanting it to be over. Then you look up and realize that the end isn\u2019t even close.

As she is dealing with this, the beloved high priestess of the school, Neferet, is trying to start a war with the humans. Zoey knows this is wrong, but doesn\u2019t know who to turn to or what to do about it. Zoey will need to figure out how to patch things up with her friends and gain confidence in order to beat the devious Neferet. I would have to say that this is the worst book in the series and the characters would have to be the worst thing about it. Specially, Erin and Shaunee with their constant name calling of \u201cTwin\u201d. Real twins don\u2019t call each other twin, so why would two people who were so connected need to put it in people\u2019s faces and call each other twin? If they were so connect that the dire need of referring themselves as \u201cTwin\u201d would not be necessary. The word count for \u201cTwin\u201d is astounding. Also, why do we need to continuously be reminded that Damien is gay? When Zoey first speaks to her group of friends she looks to Damien knowing that her \u201cgay friend\u201d is the weakest link. Can he not simply just be Damien? If he were asian would it be her \u201casian friend\u201d? Later in the book she describes Damien\u2019s boyfriend, Jack, entering a room as a \u201cgay tornado\u201d. What is a \u201cgay tornado\u201d and how does one become one? The authors have also introduced new side characters that have no personalities, which I\u2019m hoping will grow in the next book. I still haven\u2019t gotten use to Jack \u201cthe gay tornado\u201d since introduced in the last book. Zoey has also become weaker, more stupid, and a little self-centered. It has only been two days after the big fallout. She gets tired of her friends \u201cholier than thou crap\u201d, and their attitude is getting on her nerves. She later tries to confront Erik, her ex-boyfriend, and again places the fault of the break-up on him. It\u2019s a little hard to like Zoey after all these incidents. In the beginning of this series she was such a strong character. She had been able to confront her parents, burn up creepy looking fledglings, and start a conflict with the adored high priestess, Neferet. Yet, when she comes across flappy birds she freezes up. For some strange reason the authors had to have the dreaded cliff hanger, which is in most cases an automatic grade drop. I feel if you are a talented writer you shouldn\u2019t need this to have readers read your next book. Readers have a hard time remembering what had happen in the last book and feel lost when the book finally comes out. This book has a major cliff hanger and it\u2019s on a major plot line. Now, there are some saving things about Untamed. There is a lot going on, may be too much, but enough to keep the pages flying. The Cast\u2019s know how to write drama and, though predictable, the reader must know what happens in the end. The authors don\u2019t paint Christianity as such an ugly religion in this book as they have in the past or shove a Wicca type religion down our throats. Aphrodite has become my favorite character. The girl has got spunk and has become a very redeeming character. She has got more personality than the rest of The House of Night characters, including the main one, Zoey. I hope the Cast\u2019s get better. This series has got great potential and I\u2019m not sure why they felt then needed to write so much in such a small book; about 380 pages in my advance copy. If only they could stick to the main plot, which is what it seems like will happen in the next novel. I hope they write the characters more likeable. I can only read \u201cgay\u201d and \u201ctwin\u201d so many times on a page. ...more The House of Night series is unlike any other vampire series I\u2019ve read.

One that predicts the rising of a dark and terrible force \u2013 and one which predicts Zoey\u2019s death if she is alone She needs to rebuild some bridges quickly There\u2019s another element of these books that is increasingly annoying me \u2013 the authors seem to think their readers are fools, blithering fool without a scrap of reasoning who need everything explaining veeeerrrryyy slooowly and veeerrryyy carefully and over and over to make sure it sinks in. This is why the book is so full of recapping, every element of the last book repeatedly hashed over not as Stand Alone Stuffing, but because the authors seem to have that little opinion of the intelligence of their readers. We see the same thing when the characters discuss a \u201ccryptic\u201d prophecy. The meaning of it is obvious, I mean really really really obvious. It\u2019s impossible that any characters, especially purportedly intelligent characters, couldn\u2019t have easily interpreted it in second. But instead the characters describe it and work it out in ludicrously excessive detail to explain it to the readers \u2013 there\u2019s no assumption of even basic reader intelligence to work things out on their own or even realise the obvious. It had to be spelled out step by step in ridiculous detail. It makes the book \u2013 already slow and lacking in any real development or action \u2013 even slower and more painful to read And can we address that element as well? Nothing happens! Not until the very end of the book when Zoey and gang finally bravely run away. All through the book they just kind of hang around and mope. I would say they were developing their relationships or resolving conflicts or making plans \u2013 but none of that is true. Because they don\u2019t. It\u2019s not like there AREN\u2019T conflicts but they don\u2019t take effort to resolve. All her friends hate her? That takes two paragraphs to resolve. Aphrodite doesn\u2019t know where she stands? A paragraph. A prophecy to interpret? Takes pages but zero effort. We have a trip to a feral cat shelter which achieves\u2026 well\u2026 nothing, it\u2019s just there. We have lots and lots and lots of circle casting with little achievement. Hand wringing about Stevie-Rae without any real advancement or thought. There\u2019s no effort or drive or difficulty it all works out Part of which is due to Nyx, the Irritable Bowel Goddess. Whenever Zoey has a choice to make or a question to answer or needs reassurance or surety then Nyx appears. Bodily manifesting this time along with all the feelings she gives Zoey whenever she has any questions. What\u2019s hilarious is that this book also has Nyx talking about free will \u2013 but Zoey has no decision making agency of her own, she exists to be a puppet to the goddess who then draws the line about intervening elsewhere. And while I\u2019m on terrible plotting and this weird weird goddess and her idea of gifts \u2013 let\u2019s look at Stark, Zoey\u2019s newest love interest with his completely ridiculous archery power. His \u201cgift from the goddess\u201d giving him the magical power to always hit what he wants to. And by \u201cwant to hit\u201d what it actually means \u201cwhatever cryptic nonsense that a malicious trickster can twist your words into.\u201d Here\u2019s an example \u2013 Stark wants to shoot the centre of a tree. Another word for centre is, kind of, \u201cheart\u201d. And in some mythology the \u201cheart\u201d of a tree belongs to a creature of being near it. So guess what he hits? That\u2019s not a super power, that\u2019s a bow possessed by Loki. Every time he draws an arrow it\u2019s completely random whatever he will hit For more hilarity - not only does he have NO CONTROL over what he hits since any passing thought can have his power decide \"hey, you're hungry? You wouldn't be hungry if my arrow went back in time and KILLED YOUR MUM! MUAHAHA\" or some other nonsense but he is also compelled to practice his archery. Not only is this sheer evil, but it's laughably pointless - if you have the woo-woo power to NEVER MISS then practice is redundant. For added nonsense - Zoey keeps calling the forced love interest \"mysterious.\" Despite the fact the guy info dumps his entire life story within 2 pages of meeting him. This is not mystery. It does mean the inevitable I'm-not-spoiling-but-do-you-care? tragedy that hits can be ALL ABOUT ZOEY'S FEE-FEEs.

And it still irritates me that everything comes easy to her. Even making up with her friends wasn't that hard. There were things I loved. The nuns were priceless and completely worth the price of admission. That fact that Nyx, the Goddess, actually talks to them, is also very interesting - though no different than Buffy talking to the PTB. This story line was the season finale of Buffy, Season 3. Oh, a little different, but not really. I don't know if that would be so clear to the readers of the book but it was pretty obvious to me.

I don't want to give stuff away here- but the drama is huge and some of the things that were on back burners get moved to the front and some heat applied. On the back of the book it says that Neferet declared war on the humans, so I feel like I can mention that without being wicked ol' spoiler girl. So Zoey - barely 17 and head of the Nerd Herd - has to somehow stop a war between the vamps and the humans. Hu. No pressure there. Yeah. I keep thinking about everything that I read in this book and enjoying how everything unfolded.

This fourth book in the series is no exception and, if anything, is worse than the earlier books. Before I go on, I'd just like to warn that there are spoilers ahead, so if you actually think that these books can be spoiled (*snort*) beware. Here we go... In this book, we rejoin Zoey \"I'm so speschul it's a curse I just want to be normal\" Redbird right after she lost three boyfriends and all her friends turned their back on her. Don't feel too bad for Zoey, though, because in fifty pages she'll have her friends back (because of someone else's help and not through any kind of sacrifise or work on her part) and by the end of the book, at least two of her boyfriends will have forgiven her for no reason and a third one might be in the making. Hallelujah, praise Nyx. You know what - writing that physically hurt . What I find most astounding about this seris is the fact that there's been four books in the series and they only span a period of about two-three months. In this time, Zoey has (and this is major spoiler territory): - Gained four best friends, lost their trust and gotten it back again - Broken up with her human boyfriend, gotten together with him again because they bonded over his blood, lost his trust when she slept with someone else and magically regained his trust for no reason - Gotten a super hot vampyre boyfriend who liked her for no reason, lost him when he caught her sleeping with a teacher, and regained his trust for no reason - Started flirting with a teacher and sleeping with him, thus losing the two other boyfriends plus the teacher who was almost immediately killed after they slept together - Found out that her mentor, whom she otherwise considered a mentor and mother figure, was evil for no obvious reason and has been bringing dead fledgling vampyres back from the dead for... some reason - Lost her best friend because she died, gotten her back when she came back as an undead creepy thing, and gotten her back once again when her humanity was restored - Overtaken all the power, influence, and boyfriend that another girl possessed and has since become friends with said girl for no apparent reason - Gotten a gazillion superpowers and so many weird tattoos all over her body that even most zebras would just kind of snort because guuuuurl, dat's too much - Almost lost her grandmother twice And I could go on. It's like there is some kind of action, some kind of plot crammed into every single flipping sentence. You don't have time to breathe. Not even at chapter breaks. Sometimes there's a chapter break even though the scene just goes on in the next chapter. It's a steaming mess, is what it is. As much as I like action packed books, this just feels like too much. It's nice to get a breather every once in a while, some description, some atmosphere. The book just flies by at a million miles an hour and because something happens all the damn time, I have no sense of how the school looks or feels. I know they try and cram description down my throat to try and force me to find it beautiful, but it doesn't work. Even if they did slow down, where are all the other characters? The side characters? The dinner lady? The janitor? The other students? The teachers that aren't relevant to the plot? I don't care about any damn thing about this school because I don't know anything about it. The side characters are hardly ever named, if they are it's only to praise Zoey or to let us know that she doesn't like them. That does not a great setting make - it's bland and forgettable. But it's not like I care about the main characters either, because fact is they're dull, one-dimensional and, in cases where they try to introduce some character development (HELLO APHRODITE) they are clumsily executed. Aphrodite is the most blatant case of a ridiculously poorly written character. I don't know what on Earth is going on, but by god, they messed up her character. Zoey and all her kindhearted friends are quick to tell us how much of a bitch and slut Aphrodite is, and while she certainly hasn't been rosy and kind and generous, was there really ever a time where she was that bad? Even if the bitch part is true, the slut part... kind of doesn't ring true. Aphrodite has had a total of one boyfriend so far and she has cheated on zero of them. All her other interaction with the opposite sex consists of flirting with guys... which is apparently so disgusting. Anyway, Aphrodite tells us herself that she's so nasty to her boyfriends, so it has to be true... right? 'Show, Don't Tell' has never been this thoroughly bludgeoned to death and left in an alley to bleed out. Her becoming Zoey's friend is contrived and handled in such a hamfisted manner, she pretty much overshadowed much of the book with how over the top she is. I can't even remember all the things that made me want to laugh out loud while throwing the book at a wall because it happened so many times. One of my favourite things had to be Zoey's sudden connection with a guy she's known for a grand total of one day, whom she then proceeds to snog while he is dying and gushing blood out of every orifice in what is probably the least romantic scene I've read since Fifty Shades of Whyyyyy Do I Do This to Myself. Another hall of fame moment has to be the clumsiest bit of exposition I have ever read - rather than relaying everything that happened in the third book through ordinary narration, Zoey says it all out loud . All of it. It is so gloriously bad, so delightfully clumsy, it made me want to travel back in time, pat Louise the 15 year old writer of some of the worst texts in existence on the head and say 'You know, kiddo, all things considered, you weren't so bad'. All of this amounts to basically the worst book I've read of the series, and yet... I'm afraid my brain deceives me. Near the end, when the climax of the book was coming, I realised I'd forgotten just how bland and predictable the books truly are. I actually read it and thought 'Oh, yeah, I know they're foreshadowing this but they're totally going to do this other thing '.... which they didn't. At all. They went with their trite, even more predictable ending that they had already foreshadowed to death. And when I say foreshadowed I mean that they pretty much just stated what was going to happen and then it happened. Like reading a scientific paper, except more predictable. All this said, do I not recommend reading this or the other books of the series? If you know me, you already know what the answer is: Go read it. Really, I recommend this trainwreck with all my heart. It's like the horribly deformed offspring of a Mary Sue litmus test and a list of what not to do when you're writing. It's like That Novel you wrote when you were fifteen (you know which one I mean!) only published and read by a wide audience. It's like something out of a legend. It is glorious. I recommend the entirety of the series to everyone. Go out there and read horrible books and learn, broaden your horizon, read and read critically so that when you're presented with crap like this by publishers, you don't just take it in without question - go forth and read the horrible books for they will make the world a better place, one informed ability at a time. ...more 'Nala hissed long and menacingly, staring back over my shoulder at the darkness surrounding the huge old oaks that were usually so familiar and welcoming.

(hide spoiler) ] My thoughts This is the fourth book in The House of Night series, and one of the best so far for me. In this book, an outside threat directly impacts on The House of Night and really spices up the plot. I've enjoyed the previous books in this series, but for me this one was the most exciting so far. Seeing the plot unfold was really interesting. It's obvious from the start that some of the problems are caused by Neferet, as it's been clear in the last few books that she's not the person we originally thought she was. First impressions of Neferet are that she's kind and caring and acting as a mother figure towards Zoey, but it soon becomes clear that Neferet definitely doesn't care for Zoey. But I was unprepared for the enormity of what Neferet had planned, and as it started to unfold it was definitely a shock. At the end of the last book, Zoey made some bad decisions that affected her relationships with her boyfriend(s) and her friends. After being seduced by Loren Blake, a professor at the school, she lost her imprint with her human boyfriend Heath, and was caught in the act by her Vampyre boyfriend Erik. Of course, this lead to her losing all of her boyfriends, as well as her friends, when they found out she was keeping secrets from them. This is very difficult for Zoey at the start of this book, as she feels completely alone and has nobody to talk to about her terrifying experiences in the school grounds. Once again with these books, I end up feeling sorry for Zoey, as we all know what it's like to make a mistake and lose a friend. Overall, this book was the best in the series so far,for me. The introduction of an outside threat to the school made things more interesting and brought some new dangers to Zoey and her friends. Now they must team up with some unlikely allies if they want to survive. ...more UNTAMED is a vast improvement on the previous three instalments.

Neferet is playing a dangerous game and has decided to raise an ancient demon that will make all the problems that Zoey has faced up till now look like playground politics. This was a good instalment...much, much better than the Gossip-Girl prattle of the preceding books. One of my favourite characters, Grandma Redbird is finally playing a chunkier and more involved role. The introduction of unbiased nun, Sister Mary Angela promises to be a surprising but convincing choice. Zoey displays a growing maturity and this worked for me because frankly all the \u201cboyfriend-drama\u201d was getting a tad contrived. The writing was good enough to ignore the tedious repetitions. Truly, an episode that would have made Buffy and her Scooby Gang proud. ...more Breathe in, breathe out. I can't take it anymore. The terrible writing is giving me a head ache.

But I guess it was better than Chosen, I was so happy when Heath was horrible to Zoey. I was like: OOOOOOO IN YOUR FACE! I also liked this book because of Stark, I hope he comes back in Hunted. If it wasn't for this book then I don't think I would want to read Hunted. I want to know if Stark comes back? Does she get with Erik? Does Heath apologize? I just hope Hunted isn't a dissapointment like the last rubbish book but don't get me wrong I really did like Untamed! ...more okay, i'm relieved. i almost didn't read this one, cuz the third one was getting kinda stupid. this was definitely better than the third one though. i thought zoey was being REALLY stupid in the third one. and she's still kind of a hypocrite ... i mean, she had three boyfriends at once, yet she's always like, \"eww. aphrodite is such a ho.\" and i'm like \"LOOK WHO'S TALKING.\" but anyway, it was much more interesting than the last one, and zoey is sort of getting her act back together, although she okay, i'm relieved. i almost didn't read this one, cuz the third one was getting kinda stupid. this was definitely better than the third one though. i thought zoey was being REALLY stupid in the third one. and she's still kind of a hypocrite ... i mean, she had three boyfriends at once, yet she's always like, \"eww. aphrodite is such a ho.\" and i'm like \"LOOK WHO'S TALKING.\" but anyway, it was much more interesting than the last one, and zoey is sort of getting her act back together, although she still kinda annoys me. and her literally two-minute-long relationship w/that stark dude was really weird. and probably unnecessary. i didn't really get it. idk; he'll probably be more important later on in the series. i guess we shall see. anyway, i'm glad i didn't give the series up. aaaah how i luv cheap fantasy crap. lol ...more There isn't much to say about this novel other than it made me not want to finish the series. Zoe is such an annoying little putz that I just have the desire to slap some sense into her! I felt like so much of the book was what happened in the previous novels that I was bored to tears. The book should've only been 200 or so pages without the BS. I don't have a desire to read more of this series so I'll leave it at that. Also...all the love interests are laughable. I think we have all had that experience of feeling entirely and utterly alone in life, where our friends have turned against us because something has happened or we forgot to mention sometime to them. Its a horrid place to be in and its therefore a place that we can sympathize with.

Zoey has a whole lot more things to go through with regards to this book, there are things happening that none of us would ever want to go through, and would never want to understand the feeling of needing to go through. In this novel though we get to see the very thing that Nyx was saying within the first novel, that not everything light is good and not everything dark is bad. Neferet we already knew was a bit insane and that she was not actually the kind and considerate person that we thought she was back in book one. She is clearly up to a whole lot more than she can handle though and as a result its all starting to backfire on her because her little secrets are starting to slip out to a point where everyone is able to notice that something just isn't right about her. I think that in conjunction with the last book before this one, we can see that the drama is really about to flood out, but surprise surprise there could be no drama without a good looking guy trying to win over Zoey's heart, then again, it couldn't just be one good looking guy because suddenly we are back to three guys. Yes its getting a little cliche and sickening for the series because you kind of want the story to happen without the whole love fess mess that she seems to always go through. I know that they want to add a teenager reality to the novel so that we can all connect, and yes I am aware that these books are probably not aimed at people of my age. But even as a teenager I was not constantly in love with one boy after another, and I was certainly never THAT confused about what boy I wanted to be with. So yes that bit is highly annoying because you kind of know that in reality that would never be the case. Between two boys maybe, but three, Nah. thats just plain greedy, and yes, slutty. Aphrodite is certainly becoming a huge highlight of the novel because I think she represents the kind of personality that a lot of us have, where we want to be one person but instead we cover up by being something else altogether. However you can see that she really wants to help in this novel, because she doesnt want Zoey to be alone when she knows that her life is in danger, and she stands by her side in helping her with everything that is going on. the authors really allow you to see the real side to Aphrodite here in the novel and that is something that I appreciate and enjoy, because it means that you really get a greater understanding of her and you can actually identify and connect with character. The drama, although it can be overdone in a lot of books was actually represented well within this one and unlike the other novel it actually seemed more laid out and not rushed at all. It seemed to flow with this better consistency that meant you knew what was happening all the time, and that you could understand it. Of course having read up to book nine it is hard to not already know what is going to happen because you are kind of familiar, especially when old characters start to show up in the novel and you know what it is that they are going to do and who they are connect to. I do feel though that this book was particuarly well written and perhaps it was the first book within the series that really striked the match of a storyline and plot. It seemed to identify that trouble was ahead and who the trouble was linked with. Its a thought provoking sort of book but enjoyable and well deserving of five stars. Although the fact that I love the series could mean its a biased rating ;) ...more Untamed is the fourth installment in the popular House of Night YA fantasy series by P.C & Kristin Cast.

Neferet is no longer standing on the side of light and reason. So things don't start out so great for Zoey. A new enemy is revealed in this installment and it seems to be worse than she's ever heard of. It's a blending of Native American myth with the existing vampire mythology.

It took me 2 days to read it, and when I finished it it was 2 AM and I was pretty much screaming because of the cliffhanger. Next day, I got Hunted from the library and in the next 5 months I would read book six, seven, eight, nine, ten and eleven as well. But Untamed is definitely the best book in this series. ...more", "Title": "Untamed"},
