Freedom of religion. The freedom to go to the store without needing a male escort. And the ability to get an education, regardless of gender. \"I was a girl in a land where rifles are fired in celebration of a son, while daughters are hidden away behind a curtain, their role in life simply to prepare food and give birth to children.\" Malala, who is now 16, is an outspoken advocate for girls to have the same right to go to school as boys. In her native Pakistan, she lost that ability when the Taliban took over: \"I was 10 when the Taliban came to our valley ... It seemed to us that the Taliban arrived in the night just like vampires. They appeared in groups, armed with knives and Kalashnikovs ... They looked so dark and dirty and that my father's friend described them as 'people deprived of baths and barbers.'\" The Taliban started bombing schools and decreed that girls couldn't get an education. Malala's father was a school principal and encouraged her to speak out. She was only 15 at the time, but threats were made against her and her family. And in October 2012, when she was riding the school bus with her friends, a man with a gun climbed aboard the vehicle and shot Malala in the head. Amazingly, Malala survived the bullet and was able to recover. She and her family currently live in England, but Malala writes about how much she misses her home country and wishes she could return to be with her friends. Her graciousness was such that she did not wish revenge on her attacker, and instead prays for peace. \"I thank Allah for the hardworking doctors, for my recovery and for sending us to this world where we may struggle for our survival. Some people choose good ways and some choose bad ways. One person's bullet hit me. It swelled my brain, stole my hearing and cut the nerve of my left face in the space of a second. And after that one second there were millions of people praying for my life and talented doctors who gave me my body back. I was a good girl. In my heart I had only the desire to help people.\" Malala's story is both heartbreaking and inspiring. I admire her courage and her tenacity, and also hope that her country will one day find peace. \"Why are we Muslims fighting with each other? ... We should focus on practical issues. We have so many people in our country who are illiterate, and many women have no education at all. We live in a place where schools are blown up. We have no reliable electricity supply. Not a single day passes without the killing of at least one Pakistani.\" The book is lovingly written, and I also appreciated her stories about the history of Pakistan and her people, the Pashtuns. While reading the book I realized that I knew more about the history of other countries in the region, such as Afghanistan, Iran and India, than I did about Pakistan, and it was very informative. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in women's rights, current events, history or inspirational memoirs. \"Today we all know education is our basic right. Not just in the West; Islam too has given us this right. Islam says every girl and every boy should go to school. In the Quran it is written, God wants us to have knowledge. He wants us to know why the sky is blue and about oceans and stars ... The Taliban could take our pens and books, but they couldn't stop our minds from thinking.\" Update October 2014: I was thrilled to hear that Malala had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her humanitarian work. I have recommended this book to numerous people in the past year, and am still amazed by her courage. Three cheers for Malala! ...more Just to be clear, the rating is for the book not the person Malala herself. I read this quickly whilst on holidays and was keen to find out more about her story after seeing a short tv piece just before leaving home. I think her story is amazing and her courage remarkable, her plight and vision inspiring but the book itself I found to be an odd mix of political and historical fact and personal reflections that didn't quite gel for me. Still a worthy read and I really appreciated the insight into Just to be clear, the rating is for the book not the person Malala herself.

I think her story is amazing and her courage remarkable, her plight and vision inspiring but the book itself I found to be an odd mix of political and historical fact and personal reflections that didn't quite gel for me. Still a worthy read and I really appreciated the insight into the young girls life with her family. I can see that the historical documentation that was added, presumably by the other author, is there to inform people like me who have a flimsy grasp on the political events and motivations of power brokers in that region of the world, however I found Malala's personal account to be much more interesting and think the book would have done better with a different angle that focused on just her story or even told the political through her eyes or words...I found myself wondering sometimes \"who am I listening to here?\" and feeling a little as if I was being coerced into forming a political opinion based on the interpretations being offered in the factual accounts. ...more Being a fellow Muslim, I was indeed intrigued and awed by the courage of this young girl who is brave enough to state out what is wrong with her country and strive for education to be available for all. Coming from a country where education is a main priority and females over populated the men in schools,colleges and universities, I was indeed aghast to discovered that in certain parts of the world, women are being treated as second class citizens.

Coming from a country where education is a main priority and females over populated the men in schools,colleges and universities, I was indeed aghast to discovered that in certain parts of the world, women are being treated as second class citizens. It brought a tear to my eyes, how Malala and her friends struggled to continue their education despite the horrors of war, earthquake and ongoing power struggle between the military and the Islamic militants in Pakistan. Certainly Malala owed much of her courage from her own father who is an education activist and is the owner of a private school. Their family background and details about the Swat Valley is described vividly in the book and readers get to know more about the places that she have lived and been to. This book should be given out to every teens so that they would realised how important an education is and not to think of schooling so lightly. I felt so grateful to be able to live in a country where although the majority are Muslims, the women are not banned from attending schools and told to stay at homes to serve the men. Thank you, Malala for bringing attention to your plight. Isn't it ironic that instead of silencing Malala with the gunshot, the Taliban instead have given her an even bigger voice that have been heard the world over. ...more I really wanted to love this book. I don't think anyone can deny the difficulties this girl has faced or the impact she has had on the world. However, the book reads like an odd jumble of Pakistani history, politics, and personal experience that never quite comes together into a cohesive narrative. The first few chapters are very inconsistent and meander all over the place with no clear destination; it sounds more like a collection of memories or family stories interspersed with factual informat I really wanted to love this book.

The first few chapters are very inconsistent and meander all over the place with no clear destination; it sounds more like a collection of memories or family stories interspersed with factual information about Pakistan and the history of the Swat valley, and I had a very difficult time staying engaged and keeping track of the many people mentioned. The story becomes a little more streamlined as Yousafzai starts to recount her older childhood years leading up to the banning of education for girls, but I still had issues with the writing. This is one of the more egregious examples, but I think it captures the serious need for editing: \"The new girls had horrible stories. Ayesha told us how one day on the way home from Sangota she had seen a Taliban holding up the severed head of a policeman by its hair, blood dripping from the neck. The Sangota girls were also very bright, which meant more competition. One of them, Rida, was excellent at making speeches.\" (p.144). It is certainly inspirational to hear Yousafzai's and her father's stories about speaking up in defiance of politicians, local mullahs, and the Taliban, but I think many readers might lose interest trying to follow the disjointed narrative. The book feels like it was really rushed, which is a serious shame. Someone this brave and interesting deserves a better book. ...more I could not be bothered with negative comments.

I don't want to raise some sentiments here, so if your comments got deleted, like I wrote earlier, get on with your life.

Unfortunately, this was muted by the co author. 2.5 stars.. OK shoot me! I actually hated this book, because the co-author named Christina Lamb actually used 3/4 of the book and sensationalise everything. EVERYTHING! That is why I am giving 2 stars for the 3/4 of the first part of the book. And this co-author put on dates and tragedies and events and it was like, I am in war all over. I actually enjoyed <---A>Malala Yousafzai</---A> retelling, on her father's dream, on her school, on her daily life. But when the other author start saying Pakistan is bad all over, oh hey, I got quite a few friends who are studying for their qualifications in the UK, and they turned out quite well. And they are men, and not Talibans. I know Talibans are wrong because they stop the girls for going to school and be educated. But there are some people who are not bad. The way Christina Lamb painted that all Pakistanis are violent (that's the vibes here) makes me want to smack her. I am a Muslim, BTW, and this co-author who is living in London is trying to say Muslims are bad.. oh heck. But for the second part, 1/4 of the book, it will be 3 stars. This is because Malala's voice has become more prominent later in the book. And I do love and enjoy her stories after she survived that Taliban shooting in her school bus. OK if I can survive this auto biography, maybe I will survive other horrid books. ...more \u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0627 .. \u062a\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a

Too neat. You might be a fugitive for all I care but why ruin an already bad reputation by pointing out all the controversial issues of the last 20 years about a country you claim to love.I'm not even a religious or patriotic person but after reading your sobstory I feel like becoming one by kindly pointing out all the BS. I expected you to be a peacemaker not a pacemaker,Since you won a Nobel prize for peace.

You are a show off:( --We don't need to know about how high and mighty and how different from every girl you are in like every chapter.You wrote an autobiography at 16,Please let us judge for ourselves. * \u2018Don\u2019t you think she is meant for the skies?\u2019 * \u2018Malala is not just the daughter of Ziauddin,\u2019 they would say; \u2018she is the daughter of all of us.\u2019 * \u2018Malala is free as a bird.\u2019 * On some shelves were all the gold-coloured plastic cups and trophies I had won for coming first in my class. Only twice had I not come top \u2013 both times when I was beaten by my class rival Malka e-Noor. I was determined it would not happen again. * \u2018Malala was a lucky girl,\u2019 says Hidayatullah. \u2018When she was born our luck changed. * My parents say I have qualities of both grandfathers \u2013 humorous and wise like my mother\u2019s father and vocal like my father\u2019s father! Why do you hate the army everyone except the Bhutto-Zardari clan? * My country may not be very old but unfortunately it already has a history of military coups, and when my father was eight a general called Zia ul-Haq seized power. There are still many pictures of him around. He was a scary man with dark panda shadows around his eyes, large teeth that seemed to stand to attention and hair pomaded flat on his head. He arrested our elected prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and had him tried for treason then hanged from a scaffold in Rawalpindi jail. Even today people talk of Mr Bhutto as a man of great charisma. They say he was the first Pakistani leader to stand up for the common people, though he himself was a feudal lord with vast estates of mango fields. His execution shocked everybody and made Pakistan look bad all around the world. ---------> Isn't that exactly what you are doing. * Thanks to President Zardari and his family, whose love and care kept me strong. ------>This was in the acknowledgements section. I won't be surprised at all if she ends up getting married to Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and having his 2.5 kids,You know. * One day I will be a politician and do these things myself. --------->OH MY GAWD *blink blink* Now people think we are discriminating:( * We are a country of 180 million and more than 96 per cent are Muslim. We also have around two million Christians and more than two million Ahmadis, who say they are Muslims though our government says they are not. Sadly those minority communities are often attacked. * The most important jobs in the army, bureaucracy and government are all taken by Punjabis because they come from the biggest and most powerful province. (maybe because Punjab has the largest population and education to population ratio) Thanks to you now everyone thinks Pakistan is illiterate:( * \u2018I agree that female teachers should educate girls,\u2019 he said. \u2018But first we need to educate our girls so they can become teachers! Anyone living in Pakistan can see how false this statement is since majority of the teachers are women here. * The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and that man never went to the moon. Do you have something against Pakistani Doctors? * In our country few doctors bother explaining anything to an illiterate woman. * In fact the Pakistani doctors had shaved my head with no mercy. *internal scream* *internal scream* TO BE HONEST I CAN FIND A THOUSAND FAULTS, BUT I'M TOO TIRED AND I'M GLAD THIS MENTAL ABUSE IS OVER.

I have been following this story ever since Malala Yousafzai was shot and articles about her began to appear on CNN.com. I was always captivated by the way Malala spoke in interviews before she was attacked: I simply loved the sound of her voice and the sight of her face, which seemed to shine with her spirit. She might not think she is beautiful, but to me she is stunning. I adore the bright colors she wears and the liquid wonder of her eyes. It was difficult to read about the shameful, cowardly attack on her, from her own POV. I empathized so much that it was painful to hear the details--some of which she could only describe as being what was told to her about the shooting. On the other hand, I will always remember one statement she made. \"A Talib fires three shots at point-blank range at three girls in a van and doesn\u2019t kill any of them . . . I know God stopped me from going to the grave. It feels like this life is a second life. People prayed to God to spare me, and I was spared for a reason\u2014 to use my life for helping people.\" It will always give me chills to think that it is amazing indeed that a Talib gunman fired three bullets, intending to kill one young girl--and that, unbelievably, he failed. I find it very hard to argue with the idea that Malala was, in fact, spared for a reason. The parts I enjoyed most about this autobiography were the beginning and end, where Malala speaks about her home, the Swat Valley, and everything that she loved and was proud about there: from her amazing father who, unlike most Pashtuns, celebrated when his wife gave birth to a daughter, to her best friend Moniba, with whom she giggled and played with, and who was also her rival for top of the class at at Kahshul School. When Malala described an ordinary day in her old life, fighting with her younger brothers, listening to the village women who would gather at her mother's in the afternoon, I was absolutely charmed. It seemed that there was no ghostwriter and that I could hear Malala's voice speaking the words aloud as clearly as I had heard her speak on videos about her mission to help all girls, everywhere, get an education. I was fascinated to read that Malala was named after the brave Malalai of Maiwand, the greatest heroine of Afghanistan, and startled and concerned to read about the Pashtunwali code, by which all Pashtuns live, which deals with honor, but which demands revenge in kind for any attack or killing and can lead to never-ending blood-feuds easily. When it came to the terrifying attack and all that happened in its aftermath, I was glued to the book, reading page after page with breath-snatching speed. There was so much that I had never even imagined: the suffering of her parents after the shooting, the story of how they worried about ever seeing their daughter again once Malala was airlifted to England. I think that any reader from ten years on up could read and be just as captivated as I was. Although many parts of this story brought tears to my eyes I couldn't stop reading, and although I knew that Malala would make it I was white-knuckled while I learned about the details of her medical treatment. The only part that seemed to bog down was the middle of the book, where Malala describes many political events in her homeland. In these it seemed that Malala\u2019s voice was obscured and I rather quickly got lost in the details of which leader promised what and how this or that man became corrupt and never came through on their promises. Even if you just skim through this part, the book is most definitely worth reading. I came to love Malala even more dearly than I could have imagined, and to admire and even envy the bond she had with her father, the man who was determined to open a school in which girls could be educated. I couldn't help but feel great affection for all Malala's family, her people, and everything in the beautiful valley she misses as she lives in exile. I was hoping that Malala would win the Nobel Peace prize this year, not out of pity for someone who was a survivor of a hideous attack, but simply because I believe she has had an amazing effect on the world. She has brought together people from all over the globe in a way that I believe will have profound implications for the key to a better life for women in countries where it is currently against the law for girls to have a true education. I also thought that it would be stunning if the Nobel committee acknowledged that a teenager\u2014a teenage girl\u2014could have had so great a role in making people of different cultures understand each other. But Malala has plenty of time, and I have no doubt that she will distinguish herself again and again with her moving speeches, her gentle, stubborn nature, and her unique view of life in years to come. I hope that there will be more books by Malala in the future about why education is so important for girls around the world. Finally, I would like to say \u201cWah wah\u201d to Malala about the entire autobiography. She says that this is what one says when a particular line or stanza of a poem pleases you, and is a bit like \u201cBravo.\u201d Wah wah and Bravissima to Malala. ...more This is a powerful story about a child, but with topical, global relevance.

The media is full of alarming reports of extremists of all religions, across the globe. Finding perspective can be hard, especially for non-believers, and it\u2019s important to balance valid criticism and condemnation with avoiding the suggestion that all followers of a faith are mad, bad, or dangerous to know. So it\u2019s good to read a positive portrayal not just of a religious person, but a Muslim one. The fact she is young, female, and influential is all the better. Who Is Malala? People around the world know her by her first name. They know she campaigned for the right of girls to attend school, initially via an anonymous blog on BBC Urdu (aged 11). That she was shot in the head by the Taliban and eventually airlifted to hospital in Birmingham, UK - a city where she and her family currently live. That she has a very close relationship with her father. That she spoke at the UN on her 16th birthday. That when she was joint winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014, she was the youngest Nobel laureate. That she\u2019s a devout Muslim. That she\u2019s a giggler. That, I knew . I read this to understand , especially why Ziauddin (her father) is so enlightened about women and their education; how and why Malala became a campaigner so young; the role and opinion of Tor Pekai (her illiterate mother); and her two younger brothers, Kushal and Atal, raised in a culture that favours boys and men, but perpetually in the shadow of their sister. I learned the chronology, and a fair bit about Pashtun culture, the natural beauty of Swat, recent Pakistani political history, Taliban tactics, and the difficulty of living as a displaced person at home and abroad. I discovered that Malala loves Cheesy Wotsits, Justin Bieber, Ugly Betty, styling her hair, Twilight, halal KFC, gently teasing her father, high(ish) heels, pink, and squabbling with the elder of her younger brothers. She\u2019s proud of her academic prizes because she earned them, but has mixed feelings about the others, because they remind her of how much still needs to change. She comes across as a charming mixture of serious and light-hearted, mature and child-like, loyal to her heritage, but open to other ideas and influences. The perfect example was doing henna hand tattoos using symbols from chemistry and calculus, rather than the traditional flowers and butterflies. But I still don\u2019t feel I really understand the family themselves. Who are Tor Pekai and Ziauddin? Theirs was, unusually, a love match, rather than an arranged marriage. Tor Pekai may be uneducated and in the background, but \u201cMy mother comes from a family of strong women\u201d and Ziauddin always shares information and decisions with her. He\u2019s the dreamer; she\u2019s the practical one. After Malala had been airlifted to the UK and the family were battling bureaucracy to join her, it was Tor Pekai\u2019s threatened hunger strike that got things slowly moving. Ziauddin apparently overcame a childhood stammer by determination and public speaking. He was conscious of his preferential treatment for being a boy, particularly in terms of education, and felt that was wrong. He was briefly radicalised in his youth, but going away to college when Benazir Bhutto was PM, he discovered \u201cwomen who had greater freedom and were not hidden away as in in his own village.\u201d That seems insufficient explanation for founding a chain of schools against extraordinary odds, and speaking out against governments and terrorists. \u201cIt was my grandmother\u2019s faith in my father that gave him the courage to find his own proud path.\u201d Hmm. Whose Voice, Whose Truth? The more significant biographies will be written decades hence, but until then, this is an important and readable book, and I don\u2019t want to diminish that. It is by Malala in conjunction with journalist, Christina Lamb. The writing can be a little uneven and plodding, I sometimes lost track of how old Malala was, and it\u2019s not always clear to what extent her thoughts and words are really hers, or have been modulated, moderated or embroidered. Maybe it doesn\u2019t matter. When the Islamic studies teacher couldn\u2019t be trusted, her father advised, \u201cLearn the literal meaning of the [Arabic] words; don\u2019t follow his explanations and interpretations. Only learn what God says. His words are divine messages, which you are free to interpret .\u201d There\u2019s a fair bit of mythologizing. \u201cMy father always said \u2018Malala will be free as a bird\u2019 but I wondered how free a daughter could ever be.\u201d She was always special: the family\u2019s luck changed after her birth, omens abound etc. \u201cAll children are special to their parents, but to my father I was his universe\u201d \u2013 he had a wife and two other children! But given Malala\u2019s life and stature on the word stage, mythologizing is perhaps inevitable and even appropriate. But. Controversy Although feted around the world, Malala remains a controversial figure in the country she loves, and to which she repeatedly and firmly says she wants to return. The extremists think her a puppet of the west, and too liberal in her interpretation of Islam. Even moderates dislike her for symbolising bad aspects of their country, and think her hypocritical for living in greater comfort abroad (as if it were her choice). The Pakistani government created the role of Educational Attach\u00e9 in the UK for Ziauddin so the family would have income and diplomatic passports - and, crucially, not be eligible to claim asylum in the UK (which would make Pakistan look bad). What Next? \u201cWe might be the world\u2019s best-treated refugees.\u201d The Yousafzai family may live in greater material comfort now, but the pain and loneliness of their new lives, especially for Tor Pekai, is made plain. It\u2019s not safe for Malala and her family to return to Swat at the moment. Meanwhile, she\u2019s receiving an excellent education at an academically-selective private girls\u2019 school in Birmingham - a city with a large population of Pakistani heritage. She\u2019s two years older than the other girls in her class, but doing well, after the initial shock of no longer being effortlessly at the top of the class. I assume her brothers are receiving a similar education. After that, there is speculation she may go to the US for university; the only certainty is that it won\u2019t be Pakistan. She has reiterated the decision made aged 13 that she wants to be a politician. How and where remains to be seen. She\u2019s certainly fearless and determined: she only agreed to meet President Obama on condition they could talk, rather than just have a photo opportunity, and when she was awarded Pakistan\u2019s first National Peace Prize, she accepted it and then gave the PM a list of demands! Just as importantly, Tor Pekai is attending classes in English, reading and writing. Religion in My Life I was raised as an Anglican (Church of England), at home and at school. A somewhat passive (non-evangelical) sort of faith, with dramatic architecture, good music, and beautiful words. In my late teens and early twenties, I earnestly sought a personal experience of God. There were times it felt close, but I never quite got there. Eventually, I gave up the quest, and was happier facing my truth. I dabbled in Dawkins and agnosticism, and am now at the stage where I am somewhat bored with the debate, and actively dislike organised religion and many of the beliefs that go with it. Nevertheless, I retain a visceral affection for the beauty of some religious practices (only some), and respect for good and sincere believers, including those among my family and friends. I don\u2019t share Malala\u2019s faith, but I admire her sincerity, courage, commitment, and passion for worthy causes. She has paid a high price. I hope she continues to think it worth it. Good and Evil; God and the Godless History is full of people who have done evil things in the name of religion (including those who shot Malala) and non-religious people who have done great and altruistic things. But we should not forget the opposite. Malala cites the Koran as saying \u201cGod wants us to have knowledge\u201d. Her explicit religious faith may sustain and drive her, but she evangelises for girls, women, and education, rather than God. Even unbelievers and followers of other faiths can support her in that. She thanks God for saving her \u2013 but she\u2019s keen to thank people, too. It also strengthened her campaigning resolve, \u201cI was spared for a reason \u2013 to use my life helping people\u201d. Maybe the truth is that the world has good and bad people in it, and that their religion is no more relevant than whether or not they like Justin Bieber.

My world has changed but I have not.\u201d One answer to my questions is the fact that Ziauddin carries a version of Martin Niem\u00f6ller\u2019s famous poem in his pocket, \u201cFirst they came\u201d: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_t... ... UPDATE: Book versus Film A couple of weeks after reading the book, I saw the film, He Named me Malala . It\u2019s a very good complement to the book: each has things the other does not, so I recommend both. I don\u2019t think it matters which is first. The film uses charming animated sequences to illustrate the legend of Malala i and scenes from the life of Malala\u2019s parents. On screen, you see more of brothers and mother, a little more of Malala's personality \u2013 especially her famous giggle, get a feel for being on the receiving end of hordes of journalists at international events, and see some of the education projects the Malala Fund is sponsoring. However, it\u2019s no more enlightening on the relationship between Malala and her parents than the book is. The book has more (gentle) mention of Malala\u2019s own faith, more background in Pakistani culture and politics, more about Ziauddin\u2019s motivation and the schools he founded, and covers the family\u2019s difficulties in joining Malala in the UK. ...more I would ask all those Pakistanis who are making the book controversial through over-sensationalized and misplaced critiques: 1. Please remove the lenses of bigotry and prejudice and read the book in a casual way. Its not a great book so comparisons with Anne Frank's diary are perhaps out of proportion. However, I would hate to speculate that it might be considered a great classic if Pakistan continues on its usual disastrous course and experience a people's tragedy comparable to holocaust.

However, I would hate to speculate that it might be considered a great classic if Pakistan continues on its usual disastrous course and experience a people's tragedy comparable to holocaust. This in my humble yet optimistic view is impossible, God willing. 2. It is not even a well-written work either; understandably so, since its from a young girl. Its just an ad lib commentary by a 16 year old girl which is most probably composed by Christina Lamb in readable English. Our so-called second grade media intellectuals who have issues with Lamb's reputation, well Yousufzai is not synonymous with Lamb. At least try to add a minimum possible of degree of objectivity in your criticism. 3. When you quote, please do so with the purpose of discussion and critique rather than ridicule. Please learn to read and understand the texts. They are meaningless and misleading without a context. Those who are calling it interpretation of her father's ideas, well what if I may ask is wrong with that? All 16-year olds think their fathers are cool. We, as fathers and mothers, have right to impart our version of goodness into our children. We may disagree with each others' views but disagreeing with other's interpretation of history, politics and social issues doesn't make one anti-Islam or anti-Pakistan. 4. It might be a very interesting work for western audience, specially when Lamb ostensibly lets Yousafzai speak (in my view Lamb has added historical and political bits to it where necessary for coherence of discourse), but have very little for Pakistani reader in terms of engagement with the text. However, what you must understand is that you are reading a very brave girl who can stand eye-to-eye with adversity and horrors in conditions where most of us would end up compromising with our liberty or would simply run away. She is a brave girl, mentored and taught life by an audacious father. We must be proud of her and listen her carefully since we have a young hero towards whom we can point our children to look-up to. Lastly, lets try to read the same book the author has intended to write; please don't end up reading the book which you intend to criticize, apriori ...more 3.5 stars Malala is one of my idols and i've had my eye on this book for a very long time. I listened to this on audio, and the prologue of this is read by Malala herself. I cried three times just in that first half hour listening to her talk about her story.

For the first third of this book, I was convinced that I would be giving it five stars. I love what Malala stands for and I think we got such a vibrant description of her life and I loved that we got to know sort of \"a day in the life of Malala.\" She felt so real to me, like I was one of her school friends. But then toward the middle of this book, there was about 2 hours of infodumping. The story switched from an explanation of Malala's education and her life to an explanation of Pakistan and different leaders and terrorist regimes ruling and political drama, and although others might think this adds great info to the story, history/politics does NOT interest me whatsoever, so I found myself almost returning this audiobook just because I was so miserably bored. I stuck with it, though, only skim listening (is that a thing????) and it finally returned to events regarding Malala for the last third of the book. I agree so much with what Malala is fighting for and I think her story is really tragic but encouraging. I wish this book had focused less on giving us a history lesson, and rather Malala could have gone into depth about the topics she's passionate about. I will be purchasing a physical copy of this, and I would recommend it to you if you support Malala! ...more \u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0627....\u0645\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0627

resident of the area, Valley of Swat, where she lived (basically she is from the adjoining District Shangla whence her father came to Swat and established private school), I find the authenticity of

First there is the question of Local Talibans forcing girls from going to schools. That is not true. I was, as everyone else, a regular listener of the Taliban's daily half an hour or so long FM radio broadcast and they only verbally 'forced' girls to wear proper veils when going to school, which was hardly an enforcement as the local culture is already extremely conscious of the 'veil' (Mala herself wears a scarf). However, to my knowledge they 'encouraged' girls to leave 'western' schools but they 'claimed' that after installing an Islamic government here in the area, they would set up proper 'exemplary' girls schools. In fact, in the local tribal society it is unthinkable to 'force' a woman or girl from doing or not doing something as it is tantamount to man-handling them, which is, frankly speaking, a sure way to get killed or beaten not only by relatives (distant or near) of the woman/girl but anyone who is nearby. Anyone here can testify to fact that on various occasions many 'individual' talibans were mercilessly beaten up by locals when they spoke to shopping women reproachfully. Additionally, the Talibans were locals (later they were joined by savages from central Asian region and Afghanistan but they kept to themselves) and they never held absolute power here.. As opposed to the official stance, the people of Swat never left their homes when Talibans were in control, as a matter of fact, they were 'forced' to leave when army started the operation by the army. Secondly, Talibans were never in control of the city where Malala resided for so long as to impose their alleged rule. They entered the city in early May ( I was there buying DVDs with friends) by then the impending military operation had already caused educational institutions to close indefinitely. A week or ten days after the 'invasion' of the city (they, despite the hype, actually numbered not more than two or two and a half dozen who 'occupied' few private buildings and hotels) army entered the city. In any case, people started to leave the city after Taliban 'invasion' for fear of artillery and aerial bombardment by the army. Therefore, it highly unlikely that there were any female students still going to schools. This 'timing' problems also exist in her 'diary', dated January & February, which records the 'incidents' on her way to school. Valley Swat is officially a 'Winter Zone' and all educational institutions are closed for winter vacation on the 25th of December to 1st of March. Thirdly, no one is aware of anyone raising their voice for the general cause of girls education at any point during the uprising in any way or on any forum (since there was nothing as such called for). However, I personally am aware of two occasions where a relative(s), affiliated with the Talibans, tried to stop daughters or sisters of close relatives from going to school and were physically forced to abstain from any such acts in the future. I personally do not wish to malign anyone's reputation, especially not that of the adorable yet unfortunate Malala whose courage and personality I admire. However, as the history is been written, I would disapprove of any one who may, innocently, inadvertently or deliberately, represent truth in a distorted form. We were unfortunate enough to have had Talibans forced upon us, let us not be burdened with half-truths and tarnished representation. I am not alone in these perception, everyone share them here. That was the reason that the students of prime Girls College in the city here refused their college to be named after Mala.. In fact, the allegedly' repressed young girls vociferously protested out the college any such decision that forced the army and official authorities to relent. I am led to understand that there is a 'Malala Fund' with millions of dollars with the aim to spread girls education in my area.. May I respectfully ask when would a dollar from that money be spent here for the cause? ...more Malala is such an inspiration to me. Going into this book I already knew quite a bit about her but I loved hearing her first hand experiences. I also enjoyed learning more about this history and politics in Pakistan. I can see how this part might be boring to people, but being the history buff that I am I loved it. This book was better than I thought it would be.

I read Soul Surfer: A True Story of Faith, Family, and Fighting to Get Back on the Board and wasn't very impressed, even though I think what happened to Bethany Hamilton was interesting.

I read Soul Surfer: A True Story of Faith, Family, and Fighting to Get Back on the Board and wasn't very impressed, even though I think what happened to Bethany Hamilton was interesting. Same thing here. Was this just going to be a case of \"important/interesting subject matter, crappy writing?\" I didn't know. I went into this rather hesitantly, with low expectations. However, I was pleasantly surprised. There is a supporting author on this, one Christina Lamb - who is one of Britain's leading foreign correspondents. Who knows how much of this book is Lamb and how much of it is Yousafzai, but who cares? I found it very informative, educational, and interesting. It's not very emotional or rant-y or sappy - and that is going to upset some people. A friend of mine IRL who just finished this said it was 'boring.' He wanted more feelings and emotions from Yousafzai. I, however, was very pleased. I learned a lot about Pakistan, what it is like living under Taliban rule, and what life is like in the Middle East in general. DO read this book if you are looking for an educational, easy-to-read, straight-talking look at life in the Middle East during turbulent times. DO NOT read this book if you want weeping, sobbing, gnashing of teeth, or other emotional outbursts on the part of Yousafzai. Her ambition is to be a politician - and it shows. This is very much a politician's book. Even-keeled and conscious of saying the right thing and presenting the right face. I didn't mind this, but I could see how it would bother some people. One plus is that the book has photos - I always enjoy non-fiction books more if they include photographs of the people involved. You can see many pictures of Yousafzai growing up, all her family members, the bus she was shot in, her in the hospital, etc. etc. I thought this added a lot to the book. Yousafzai is very Muslim and is a very religious person - but she is also a great advocate for girls and women's education. It's important nowadays to separate the ideas of \"Muslim\" and \"psychotic terrorist/religious extremist\" in our minds, especially in the U.S. of A. and other countries in which it seems a strong anti-Muslim sentiment is growing. Reading this book will put a human face on Islam even if it does nothing else for you. Tl;dr - I really enjoyed this - if only because I felt like I learned a lot from it. Yousafzai paints a vivid picture of what living in the Middle East in the 2000s is really like. Of course, I already knew what had happened to her and how her story would end... everyone knows her story. So there were no surprises for me here. This has been on my reading list for a long time and I'm glad to have finally read it. ...more A few days prior to her 18th birthday, Malala Yousafzai has returned to Oslo, to attend the Oslo Education Summit, insisting that all children worldwide have a right to education. Her defiant slogan claims, \"Books not Bullets!\" Malala claims, \"I measure the world in hope, not doubt\" and \"Pens and books are the weapons that defeat terrorism\" .

Her defiant slogan claims, \"Books not Bullets!\" Malala claims, \"I measure the world in hope, not doubt\" and \"Pens and books are the weapons that defeat terrorism\" . Last year in Oslo, Malala was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with another child rights activist, Kailash Satyarthi. They were honoured \"for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education\" . At 17, Malala was the youngest person ever to receive this award; Malala Yousafzai is indeed a determined and remarkable person. In this book, I am Malala: the girl who stood up for education and was shot by the Taliban , she tells her incredible story. The book is an absorbing read, an amalgam of Malala's own memoir, plus a history of the troubled country of Pakistan. Most readers will have lived through some - if not all - of the times described, unlike the author, startlingly only 15 herself when she wrote it. To many of us this is not \"history\" but merely remembrance of current events happening elsewhere in the world during our lifetimes. Could she have a proper grasp of such complex issues of current affairs? Malala is fluent in Pashto, English, and Urdu. She is articulate, brave, compassionate, informed, driven - and very focused. Growing up at the heart of an area targeted by the Taliban, she had a unique experience living under a developing regime of terror. When Osama Bin Laden was eventually discovered in hiding, it was, to everyone's shock, just a few miles away from where Malala herself lived. Along with the guidance and influence Malala's activist father has had on her, perhaps she was destined to become the person she is. The book starts with a prologue, briefly describing the day when she was shot, from Malala's point of view. The name \"Malala\" means \"grief-stricken\". Malala was named after Malalai of Maiwand, a famous Pashtun poetess and warrior woman from southern Afghanistan. It was an unusual name, which many thought to be unlucky or inappropriate. Reading her account, it is clear that her father knew from the start that there would be something different about this child. Malala was allowed to stay up at night and listen to all his political conversations with his friends, long after her two brothers had been sent to bed. She was encouraged to read and think; to have a mind of her own. The Yousafzai family were part of a large Pashtun tribe in the Swat Valley in Pakistan. Her family consisted of her father Ziauddin and her mother and two younger brothers. They were very poor, but part of a strong community in Mingora. There were comparatively few modern amenities such as running water and electricity; waste disposal and disease were a big problem, but the valley itself was lush and beautiful, and Malala thought her home was wonderful. This first part of Malala's story is entitled \"Before the Taliban\" . Malala describes her grandparents and parents' history, how events had shaped each generation in her family. There was her father, an outspoken poet and education activist, who overcame his chronic shyness to learn public speaking to impress his own father. There was her more traditional, uneducated mother, who too began school at the age of six - but stopped before the term was over. Malala includes many family anecdotes, explaining the varying cultural mores as she does so, and interspersing the account with the troubled political history. The section has 8 chapters, and is over a third of the book. It takes the reader carefully though all the difficulties Pakistan has faced since its creation on 14th August 1947. Malala relates the views of her people, who regretted the loss of Swat's identity when it joined Pakistan. Additionally, the creation of a \"home for Muslims\" within Pakistan's boundaries was established too hastily, inevitably resulting in other faiths such as Hindus fleeing across the border to India. Economic chaos ensued, and peace has never yet come about. Since then, Pakistan has suffered under various regimes. There have been three Indo-Pakistan wars, several military coups, and numerous unsuccessful attempts at a military coup. The regime has lurched between military rule and democracy, between dictatorships and brief periods when a Prime Minister such as Benazir Bhutto was in power. She served two terms, but was eventually killed, clearly assassinated, although Malala carefully chronicles the muddled events. Pakistan has had varying degrees of both political and police corruption and is in constant turmoil. It is remarkable that any normal life can survive such conditions, but the life Malala describes is a happy one. Her father's greatest love apart from his family was the Khushal Public School which he established. The values of education ring clear and true throughout, having been instilled in Malala from a very early age. She also begins to develop her own opinions, drawing from her experience. One shocking episode helped to crystallise her views. Malala came across some scavenger children, who lived inside a huge mountain of rubbish. They had matted filthy hair, were dirty, diseased and covered with sores and lice. Picking out cans, bottle tops, glass and paper from the rotting pile of rubbish, they would sell them to a garbage shop for a few rupees, barely enough to live on. Malala begged her father to take a couple of these starving children into his school without pay, and inwardly vowed that she would work as hard as she could towards a time when every one of those children would have an education by right. In the meantime she wrote a letter to God, and sent it down the Swat river. Towards the end of this first section, it is apparent that the Taliban's influence had begun to be felt in the Swat valley. Across the border in Afghanistan, the Taliban had enforced a very strict interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law. In horror folk learned of the massacres, the brutality towards women, the denial of food to ordinary people, the burning of homes, crops and land. Malala explains that the majority of the Taliban were made up of Afghan Pashtun tribesmen, simple ignorant people who had always been looked down on by many educated people, including those poor themselves, such as Malala's family. Recruits were resentful of any who had advantages, such as good jobs, and easily influenced by a fundamentalist idea of Islam. Seeing an opportunity to seize power, with weapons in their hands, they took it. There were many variations of interpretation of Islam present in Pakistan, not to mention other religions, but Malala's people could see others fleeing for their very lives as the regime continued. They were equally suspicious of the US, thinking that they inflamed the situation, causing innocent casualties. The local \"Mufti\" , a religious leader, was making decisions for the whole community. He was very critical of Malala's father's school; the girls should not be seen, they must be segregated. They should not learn certain inappropriate subjects. He made increasingly outrageous statements, such as that Ziauddin was running a \"harem\" in his school. Purdah was insisted upon for younger girls, and more strictly. The Mufti was determined to enforce his own brand of Islam; individual interpretation was quashed. The section ends in 2005, when a massive earthquake in Pakistan killed over 70,000 people. Fundamentalists seized on this as a sort of punishment, a seal of approval on all their edicts. The second part is entitled, \"The Valley of Death . Malala is now 10 years old, and she describes the arrival of the Taliban in her village. A self-proclaimed Taliban leader named Maulan Fazlullah had risen to power, through a popular local radio station in Swat, appealing mostly to the ignorant and uneducated. In his radio broadcasts he offered instruction on how to obey the Quran. He soon had many followers - including Malala's own mother. His demands became more strident and fanatical, calling for an end to televisions, DVDs, and other modern technology. The public humiliations began of anyone who didn't obey his interpretation of the law, including women who did any work outside the home. The 7 chapters in this section are primarily about the suppression of the people of Swat, and the growth of Taliban influences. Some of the episodes referred to - the beatings, the beheadings - are harrowing, despite this being seen through the eyes of a young girl. Malala's education continues, but the reader is wondering for how long this can continue. Many girls have been taken away from the school and sometimes Malala is the only girl in her class. Very competitive, she has two close friends, equally clever. As time passes it becomes increasingly difficult for Malala to study. Military tanks are in evidence everywhere. On one occasion, travelling in a relative's car, the driver panicked, asking her to hide a CD of music in her clothes. Malala often began to feel afraid when on the streets, imagining that every man she met was a member of the Taliban. She and her friends stopped wearing their school uniforms and hid their books as they travelled to and from school. The beatings and beheadings continued. A nearby school was bombed during a prayer service in honour of a fallen police officer. When Malala is 11, she is approached by the BBC who feel that a child's viewpoint would be very significant. She is asked to write an anonymous blog about her life, and chooses the pseudonym \"Gul Makai\". People she knows, including some of the girls at school discover it but she wisely keeps it secret. The Taliban's powers are increasing. They have instructed families to send them the names of marriageable women, so that marriages can be arranged for them. They have announced a date in 2009, by which all girls' schools must be closed, yet Malala keeps hoping that something will prevent this. She becomes bolder and more confident, being taken in 2008 by her father to Peshawar to speak at the local press club. She has written a clear and passionate speech, \"How dare the Taliban take away my basic right to education?\" Inevitably though, the final day of school arrives. Malala cannot believe it; her books are her proudest possessions. She is followed around by a camera crew from the New York Times, making a documentary. Her life seems empty without school, and increasingly the family are living in fear of their very lives. Malala compares their existence to a family of which she has just read, in \"Anne Frank's Diary\". Deciding they will have to leave their home, Malala's family, like many others, flee to relatives. Others flee to friends, even though this means that in some homes the males have to leave. The Pashtun tradition of hospitality conflicts with the belief that an unmarried female should not reside in the same home as a male who is not her relative, but they respect both principles. Malala goes to school again with a cousin. She is now 12 years old, although everybody is living in too much turmoil to mark her birthday in the way they always had. The third part is entitled, \"Three Bullets, Three Girls\" . We know what this section is going to be about, but now we also feel we know the girl herself; her history, and how her individual experience slots into the mess and bloodshed that is Pakistan's inheritance. It is three months later, and Malala's family return home to find much of their village destroyed during the battles. The Taliban has gone, the Pakistani Prime Minister promises, but many people don't believe it. Some return and eventually school resumes, but many stay away. During these 5 chapters, Malala's beliefs become more fully formed. She wonders what it would be like to leave school at 13 to be married, just as one of her classmates has. The climate of opinion changes. There are still tanks on every street corner, machine guns posted on rooftops, checkpoints all along a route, but now people blame the US. Why were they still there, 3 years later? There was even outrage at the American raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. The details were unclear. Why had the US conducted the raid on their own, without telling the Pakistanis or seeking help from them? Conspiracy theories abound. Had the Americans perhaps even actually killed bin Laden years earlier? Clearly the Taliban are still present, carrying out atrocities very close to their home. On Malala's 14th birthday, when she is officially considered to be an adult, the family learn that one of Ziauddin's outspoken friends has been attacked. Malala agrees to follow her mother's advice, and even though the school is so close, she takes a rickshaw to school, and the bus home. The section ends with the shooting which made world headlines. On 9th October 2012, a Taliban gunman shot Malala through the head, neck, and shoulder as she rode home from school on the bus after taking an exam. Although Malala can remember very little about it, being preoccupied with her own thoughts, the masked gunman apparently shouted, \"Which one of you is Malala? Speak up, otherwise I will shoot you all\" . Her identity became obvious, at which point he shot at her. Two of her friends, Kainat Riaz and Shazia Ramzan, were also wounded, but survived. Part four is entitled, \"Between Life and Death\" . It contains just 2 chapters, about a time of which Malala can remember very little. Immediately following the attack, she was rushed to Swat Central Hospital. There she remained unconscious, in a critical condition. The political machinations behind the scenes continued. The chapters give clinical details, and credit one doctor, \"Dr Fiona\", for preventing Malala's death when staff neglected to follow specialist procedures necessary for the brain and body to recover. She insisted that Malala be sent to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, UK for intensive rehabilitation. Her parents were not able to travel to see their daughter, due to protocol. What comes across to the reader is the ignorance apparent at every level, but also a sense that it is possible for individuals to overcome this, even when the odds seem stacked against them. The final, fifth part \"A Second Life\" also consists of 2 chapters. Malala now tells of her recovery more from her personal experience. By 17th October, she had come out of her coma and begun to repond. She was terribly worried about the cost of her treatment, thinking that her father would have to sell his land. She still had not been able to see her father. Eventually everything progressed to the point where the Pakistani government paid for her treatment, she was able to be visited by her family, and best of all, she had no lasting brain damage, only nerve damage. On 3 January 2013, Malala was discharged from the hospital to continue rehabilitation at her family's temporary home. On 2nd February she had a five-hour operation to reconstruct her skull and restore her hearing. Since March 2013, she has been a pupil at the all-girls' Edgbaston High School in Birmingham. Although happy there, she evidently misses her old life, and would love to go home some day. She realises that her new classmates regard her as a children's rights activisit, but sometimes longs to just be the normal simple Pashtun girl of old, in Minora ... The co-author of this book is Christina Lamb, a British journalist who is currently Foreign Correspondent for the Sunday Times. Her credentials for helping to write this particular book are impeccable. She first interviewed Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in London in 1987. She then continued her work as foreign correspondent in Pakistan, journeying through Kashmir and along the frontiers of neighbouring Afghanistan. She has interviewed the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. Always working in war-torn countries, she was even once deported back home. Commenting on the worsening devastation and destruction by the president Robert Mugabe and the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front since she started reporting from Zimbabwe in 1994, she maintains that this has been her most harrowing experience. In 2006, Lamb was reporting from Southern Afghanistan, meeting with town elders. The team were then supposedly directed to a safe route out, but soon after they had left, the British were attacked by Taliban fighters. Anyone who experienced running through irrigation trenches, with Kalashnikov rifles and mortar firing from all directions, for two and a half hours, is well qualified to co-author this book. Immediately after this book she wrote another about her many years in Afghanistan and Pakistan. She is critical of many missed opportunities by the US, to help resolve the long war, blaming the poor relationship US has with Pakistan for many of the continuing problems of terrorism. Interestingly it is possible to see the seeds of that book within this one. Often the voice of Malala seems critical of the US, and their inability to be effective, even a mistrust of American troops. But whose is the underlying voice? It is impossible to really know. Other parts of the book suggest the hand of an experienced foreign affairs correspondent. The indepth knowledge of both contemporary issues and the country's history and political situation, as well as of the many different tribes, languages and customs within each region, is so very extensive. The issues are complex and quite difficult for the general reader, only aware of the basic schism between Sunni and Shia Muslims, to assimilate. The roots of the split are ancient, originating in a dispute soon after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. Sunni Muslims such as Malala's family follow the orthodox and traditionalist branch of Islam, which takes as its precedent the actions of the Prophet Muhammad. Shia Muslims are followers of Muhammad's son-in-law and cousin, whom they claim as Muhammad's successor, believing that only God has the prerogative to appoint the successor to his prophet. But there are massively complex distinctions between all the different factions within both Sunni and Shia. Could the complicated issues explored all be Malala's work? However Malala is an erudite speaker and writer. I have no doubt that the views, anecdotes, and probably the structure of the book are hers, and that the passion with which she explains her views is hers alone. It is well balanced, her own experience set within the ongoing political situation. But perhaps there is slightly too much input from history to make the memoir flow easily. Malala is a courageous, intelligent, indefatigable person. I would have loved to say this book merits 5 stars. It very nearly does, and I have a sneaky feeling that if she is ever inspired by events in her life to write a book again, it probably will. The subtitle of the book is, the girl who stood up for education and was shot by the Taliban . Malala insists that surviving being shot in the head is not what she wants people to focus on, but the issues of children's rights, women's education and world peace. Surely that is what we should take away from reading this book. \"Our people have become misguided. They think their greatest concern is defending Islam and are being led astray by those like the Taliban who deliberately misinterpret the Quran ... We have so many people in our country who are illiterate. And many women have no education at all. We live in a place where schools are blown up. We have no reliable electricity supply. Not a single day passes without the killing of at least one Pakistani.\" ...more \u062d\u064a\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u0641\u0631\u063a\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0629 \u0647\u0630\u0647

If she was so annoyed with Swat being a part of Pakistan why does not she openly say that I am not a daughter of Pakistan rather daughter of swat. She has further cemented the mistake West has made over the years. You see each area in Pakistan has its regional customs in addition to Islamic customs and traditions. She failed to clarify that What Pashtuns or Taliban are soliciting is a cocktail of Islamic and Pashtun traditions. Islam never debars any Muslim from seeking education. Our Prophet Muhammad May Peace Be Upon Him solicited that seek knowledge even if you have to walk to China. Also education and knowledge attainment is mandatory for Muslim women and men. I'd like to enlighten the western public that science practicals and computer labs are available in Pakistani educational institutes. The access may be shared among students but availability is there. Being a graduate myself from UK mu college had a computer lab which had a designated area for me. If I required to load a laptop I had to furnish a written request and wait in a queue. Most alarming thing for me was that Pakistani's oppress women. This could be attributed to rural areas but not at all applicable to cities or urban towns. We have doctors, teachers, accountants, nurses, air force and commercial pilots. More than a decade ago Islamabad witnessed Pakistan's first lady cab driver, a widow who purchased a cab on hire purchase under the then Prime Minister's initiative. Thank God I did not purchase this book otherwise it would have been a waste of \u00a37.49 of my hard earned money.

The book begins about the day when the Talibans shot Malala and then goes on a flashback. We get to know about Malala's family, Malala's father's struggle to set up a school, the social customs of the Pashtuns, a short lesson about the factors that led to the rise of extremism in her country, government apathy towards the masses, army inaction, the sheer terror of living under the extremists etc. We would also get glimpses of Malala as the young girl she is - whether fighting with her brothers, best friends, enjoying TV series. I had read about the atrocities committed by the extremists in newspapers but reading a first hand account of the victim somehow made it more terrifying. Malala only wanted the right to go to school and she was shot for it. As children, most of us hated having to go to school and there are people in this world who fight and risk their lives for this privilege. Many people say with forceful conviction that it is education which can put an end to this extremism and end many of the injustices prevalent in this world. I agree but somewhere there is a small doubt which keeps nagging me. In the papers I have read about young people, of both sexes, hailing from well-to-do families and having the privilege of attending good schools and colleges, gravitating towards extremist ideologies. Then there is something seriously wrong with the education system of the world - i say world because this is happening in many countries, and the authorities should think about it. I would recommend it to anyone who likes reading good books. ...more So I knew of Malala before this...but I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HER REALLY. And I was so curious!

I always find it really hard to review memoirs because... I don't want to critise the person's life . But sometimes the writing and I don't mix. That's definitely the case here. Malala is AMAZING. But the book is. so. politically. heavy. I was just...I was lost. And the writing felt really detached? Like Malala is really intelligent and knowledgable and amazing, but her writing (to me) lacked any personalisation. Like even when she's shot, she just clinically writes \"and then I was shot and this is where the bullet went\". So IDEK. Maybe that's just how memoirs go... It's really interesting to get such a personalised glance at Pakistani culture too!! Because I really don't know much about Pakistan today OR the politics. NOW I KNOW A LOT. (Although I feel like it went in one ear and out the other. Seriously. I'm overwhelmed right now.) So despite being a) flooded with information and drowning, b) not really understanding all the politics, and c) feeling like the writing was sort of clinical... the story is truly an inspiring and remarkable one and I REALLY LIKED READING IT.

The difference is..., many of us, can remember being 16 years old, also aware as injustice in our world, yet we didn't stand alone- speak out... fight .. ( as if our lives depended on our fighting), for injustice in the world to the level this young girl did. So, yes.. This young girl was very brave.. ( everything people have said about her is true). Under horrific conditions... she kept speaking out.. at the risk of her safety. She herself is truly remarkable. As far as the book itself.., it could have used some editing! Some parts were choppy-& disjointed - other parts felt immature, ( we are reminded that Malala 'is' still very young). Some parts, of course, we're painful- heartfelt- moving- but much was inspiring... because Malala is inspiring. As brave as this young girl has been-- she is also a girl easy to support. The entire world knows who she is now. With the right type of guidance -and support -we should see more great contributions from Malala throughout her adulthood.

I felt that this book fell short in portraying Malala's story: it jumbled up Pakistani history, politics, and Malala's own experience in a way that did not make much sense. The book's disjointed, impersonal structure disappointed me, and I wish we could have read a more linear, cohesive narrative all from Malala's viewpoint. We all know the power and wisdom of Malala's voice; I would have enjoyed I Am Malala if I had heard more of it. If you want to learn a little more about Malala's upbringing, Pakistani history, or the Taliban, I would still recommend this book. It does a good job of sharing Malala's story, even though it could have done a lot better. ...more \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0631 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0642\u0644\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0644 \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0623\u062c\u0645\u0639 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u062a\u064a\u0646 \u0637\u0641\u0644\u0629 \u062a\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u062f\u0648\u0646\u0627\u062a\u060c \u0635\u0627\u0631\u062a \u0628\u0637\u0644\u0629 \u0644\u0623\u0646 \u0637\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644\u062a \u0642\u062a\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639 \u0623\u0637\u0641\u0627\u0644 \u062a\u062d\u0635\u062f\u0647\u0645 \u0637\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0643\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0623\u0641\u063a\u0627\u0646\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u062d\u0635\u062f\u0627\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0644\u062a\u0641\u062a \u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0623\u062d\u062f\u0627 ...... \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0627\u062d\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u0646 \u062c\u0647\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0636\u0645\u0648\u0646\u060c \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0645\u0644 \u062c\u062f\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0641\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0644\u0647\u060c \u0648\u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0625\u0645\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u062c\u0647\u0627\u062a \u0646\u0638\u0631 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0627\u062d\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u064a\u062f \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062d\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0641\u062f\u062a\u0647 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0635\u0641 \u0644\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0633\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0627\u062f \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644 \u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0642\u0644\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0647\u0631 Read review on Wordpress I have wanted to review this book about the life of this beautiful person for a while, and due to the circumstances Muslims (particularly women, considering my parents told me to remove my headscarf until things calmed down) are facing right now after the terrorist attacks in Beirut, Paris, Syria, Nigeria, Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Tunisia, Yemen, Somalia, and many others, this seems like the perfect time to include a person that represent a side of Islam that i Read review on Wordpress I have wanted to review this book about the life of this beautiful person for a while, and due to the circumstances Muslims (particularly women, considering my parents told me to remove my headscarf until things calmed down) are facing right now after the terrorist attacks in Beirut, Paris, Syria, Nigeria, Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Tunisia, Yemen, Somalia, and many others, this seems like the perfect time to include a person that represent a side of Islam that is not often depicted in media, the side of peace and non-fundamentalist views. Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani activist that was shot at by the Taliban after going to school and promoting education for everyone. Yes, the Taliban shot her because she stood up for education. And although this book is mostly about how she grew up, and where, and how the Taliban came to control Swat Valley, it is the perfect introduction for everyone that wishes to know how this Nobel Prize laureate became one of the greatest activist in the world, and how she represents the best of us, no matter the faith or no faith at all, ethnic background or culture, or sexuality, she is some of the best humanity has to offer. \u201cWe realize the importance of our voices only when we are silenced.\u201d Malala was silenced by these terrorist extremist, that saw to oppress women and take away from them the right given by Ar-Razzaq. The Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) said \u201cAcquiring of knowledge is obligatory to every Muslim male and female\u201d and \u201cAttain knowledge from the cradle to the grave.\u201d Denying anyone education simply based on their sex or gender is an insult to the greatest man to have walk this earth and his creator, Malala sees this, and fights those against it, with words instead of swords. I appreaciate so much that Malala uses Islam and Muslims as examples to why no one should be denied such a basic human right, and in turn, educating people that might not otherwise see such examples of Muslims being portrayed, as often they are shown \"the evils of Islam and the prophet of war.\" There are of course certain passages in the Quran that promote violence on certain circumstances, I will not deny it, but so does almost, if not every, religious text in existence, as well as many political legislation, violence is not specific only to religion, but to ever form in the world, for evil does exists, and denying its existence would be an offense to our intelligence. \u201cWhen the whole world is silent, even one voice becomes powerful.\u201d This is a girl who, during an interview with Jon Stewart had this to say to him after she wonders what she would do if the Taliban comes for her again: \u201cIf you hit a Talib, then there would be no difference between you and the Talib, you must not treat others with cruelty\u2026You must fight others through peace and through dialogue and through education. \u2026 I would tell him how important education is and that I would even want education for your children as well. That\u2019s what I want to tell you now do what you want.\u201d Here she is showing the most common thing I have seen Muslims perform in the past few years after all the harassment and hatred spewed towards them, turning the other cheek. Malala is a Muslim and sees Islam as a way to reform those that claim to be Muslim and commit acts of terror in the name of the same religion, rather than using other forms that might contradict with the culture of many. She seeks to reform true the one thing they all share, a belief in Allah, the Prophet, and Quran. The best a Muslim can do is perform jihad (a struggle) against those that are tyrants. Malala is performing jihad against terrorist every time she speaks against them, every time she breathes, every time she turns a year older, and every time she condemns what they are doing. This book is jihad, and I am honoured to have been able to read it. \u201cEducation is education. We should learn everything and then choose which path to follow. Education is neither Eastern nor Western, it is human.\u201d I cannot recall how many times I have been told or someone of my same faith, has been told that they cannot possibly be feminists, for it is a Western value, and that equality is a thing that goes against my religion, and therefore I am oppressed and should leave the faith. To those I say: look at Malala. She shows that education and feminism is not pertaining to be against any faith or culture, but rather the creation of domineering people that seek to limit the rights of others, and calls world-leaders and the common people alike to seek for equality and respect. So think of Malala next time you see a Muslim man being threatened for having a beard. Think of her when you see a Muslim girl having her hijab pulled by ignorant people. Think of her whenever there is an injustice done to a man who is holding hands with his partner, and when a girl dresses with more \"masculine clothes.\" And then think of her as you stand with those being discriminated and as you fight for equality, it will give you strength. It gives me strength, if Malala is not afraid after all she went through, I shall not be afraid either. Here are some videos of Malala's speeches and appearances.

For one, it\u2019s a memoir. How do you criticize a person\u2019s life? And when that person is Malala who is such an inspiring and strong young woman it seems like even more of an impossible feat. So when I say that I didn\u2019t love the book, it by no means is a judgement of the main character or her family. What didn\u2019t work for me was the way the book was written.

It was very heavy on the political side but I didn\u2019t really mind that since I enjoy learning about different cultures and countries. What bothered me more was how content and writing didn\u2019t mesh. It was an odd mix of political and historical fact as well as personal reflections on Malala\u2019s part and it just didn\u2019t quite gel. I wanted more personal insight from Malala rather than her almost clinical detachment. Sometimes I wondered who I was even listening to, Malala or Christina Lamb. Still, a worthy read that I can definitely recommend. It\u2019s an inspiring story that will hopefully give you some insight into the political situation in Pakistan. ...more \u201cI don't want to be thought of as the \"girl who was shot by the Taliban\" but the \"girl who fought for education.\" This is the cause to which I want to devote my life.\u201d \u2015 Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban The day Malala was in the news headlines catching the attention of the world , I remembered myself back on my younger years when I was still so idealistic, wanted to make a big difference by helping survive the dying Mother Earth and ed \u201cI don't want to be thought of as the \"girl who was shot by the Taliban\" but the \"girl who fought for education.\" This is the cause to which I want to devote my life.\u201d \u2015 Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban The day Malala was in the news headlines catching the attention of the world , I remembered myself back on my younger years when I was still so idealistic, wanted to make a big difference by helping survive the dying Mother Earth and educate the youth as well. Malala invigorated that desire. Then, I kept track of her personal life . I watched her on CBS news and even her speeches and TV guest appearances on Youtube. I will not forget her speech at the U.N where she expressed her desire to continue her fight for girls' right to education. In fact,her closing statement marked in my memory, \u201cOne child, one teacher, one book and one pen can change the world.\u201d Her speech made me cry and clap many times as though I belonged to the audience in the chamber surrounding her in awe.Then in 2013, her autobiography was launched . However, I was so frustrated that I was not able to buy it yet because of its exorbitant price. After a few years, I\u2019ve got my own copy and read it with gusto. In the end, I fathomed Malala more. I was moved to the bone and shattered at my reading chair. I revere Malala not only because she was shot by Taliban for speaking up for the right of girls but also because she was very young , at the age of 16 , to get silenced. I may sound ignorant of the current and affairs around the world, but who can imagine that a young girl like her living in one of the tumultuous lands on earth was able to stand up to a group who could have almost killed her? I have known some admiring people who have been staunch for their causes, but so far Malala is one of the most incredible persons I have known in my generation. Reading this book sounds like the author is an old adult who has grown up a lot , for she is too mature to speak of the miserable situations in the world. She is so smart that she understands her rights. However, you may realize that the author turns out to be as young as your niece or cousin - Malala is also an ordinary girl like the other girls playing outdoor games, fond of watching romantic movies and dramas, interested in reading books . Think of her as a young lady, but take her seriously. She really means business. Aside from the fact that she has the courage of her own convictions, there are the other sides of Malala that made me grin from ear to ear. She likes studying a lot. She is always eager to learn the things she has not understood yet. That is why she is academically competitive but intellectually humble. In fact, she likes History and Physics. The cute thing is she is a big fan of Twilight and other books about vampires. Also, she likes journalistic writing and is a nature lover as well. But the most important thing I have learned from her is to stand up for your rights. Before, I wanted to be an environmentalist. I wanted to help the famous Filipino environmentalist, Chin-Chin Gutierez, on her advocacy of surviving the Mother Earth. I started in little ways. However, I lost interest and courage to do so when everything in our society turns out to be so powerful that I could be run over. Nevertheless, when I read Malala's story, since then, I said I want to do it again. I hope I can do it again, for life on this earth is so infinitesimal. \u201cLife isn't just about taking in oxygen and giving out carbon dioxide.\u201d \u2015 Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban ...more<+++>I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban</+++>", "Title": "I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban"},
