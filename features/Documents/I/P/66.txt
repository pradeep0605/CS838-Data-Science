Rachel Hawkins is a good author and well, I really liked the way she wrote the characters but seriously, do I have to pick a team? I didn't like team picking in elementary school (I had, umm, a slight weight problem so I was always picked last- bad,<---M> bad memories)</---M>, why the hell would I start picking teams now! But, noooo, once again, I must decide Team Archer (bad boy), or Team Cal (good boy). Of course, our lovely Sophie wants the bad boy. But, she has some feelings for our good-boy-can't-do-anything-wrong-silent-type Cal. I have a solution- I'm just saying, that would set the book apart! Now onto the story.<---F> It annoyed me as well</---F>. See, I'm stuck in Sophie's head and well, Sophie is a bit teenage-ish. Yes, I do know she IS at teenager but pleezze... she is SEVENTEEN not 13. Plus, she is a super strong demon. I can understand she is insecure about who she is, her paranormal powers, bleh, bleh, bleh BUT she seemed very immature. Her internal dialogue really got on my nerves. Being distracted by our lovely but annoying Sophie, it was hard to get into the story. In fact, I didn't really find a story until halfway through. The \"mystery\" wasn't really a mystery. It was really easy to figure out. The relationship problems between Sophie and her dad seemed like they were inserted after the fact. What I really loved. <---C>Jenna</---C>. She really was the best character in the book. She's really well-written and a very enjoyable character. Thank the vampire gods that she was in this book, or maybe I wouldn't have been reading it. Nick. You'll meet him in the book. He's kind of interesting but I couldn't get a grasp of him. Nevertheless, I enjoyed his character enough. Cal. I like that his character (until the end of the book) was reliable and predictable. I know that seems weird but I didn't find myself going \"pleeeze\" during his parts. He's good, acts good and has a good heart (of course, the cliffhanger might change that). Here is what really sucks- I want to read the next book. I really like the way Rachel Hawkins writes. I almost think that someone else dictated that way this stupid love triangle should play out. You can see that Hawkins has talent. I'm hoping she realizes that she's better than this twilight-ish crap. I know, the potential to see your character's faces on t-shirts, candy bars, and stuffed pillows might make life more profitable but I hope Hawkins rises above the dollar signs! ...more This sequel to Hex Hall is...

I really do. To prove it, I\u2019ll gladly take Cal into my arms just to rid the story of the unnecessary love triangle. I honestly enjoyed this. I\u2019m really very thankful to the author for making me laugh throughout the book. My 11 year old niece kept giving me this \"my-aunt-is-definitely-losing-it\" look because I couldn\u2019t stop myself from giggling while reading this. There seems nothing that comes out from Sophie\u2019s mouth that didn\u2019t make me laugh. Even her reply to a romantic confession is downright hilarious. \"Wow, Cross. I think you missed your calling. Screw demon hunting: you should clearly be writing Hallmark cards.\" The side stories, the new characters and other themes especially about friendship and family are delightful to read. But that ending (or the lack of it)...I was like... I know I promised several amazing people here ( Melissa , Daiane and Jilly ) that I\u2019ll read Angelfall right after this but there\u2019s no way I could do that now because this doesn\u2019t have an ending guys and I might really lose it if don\u2019t get my ending immediately.

I remembered the love triangle from the first book in the series, Hex Hall , but I didn\u2019t remember a lot of the plot before I started the second installment. As it turns out, that didn\u2019t really matter because Rachel Hawkins reacquaints readers with all the characters and important plot points in a conversation early on. I was happy for the reminders but fans who remember more about HH might be a little bored for the first bit. The majority of this book is interesting but not riveting. Hawkins has a great sense of humor but there were a lot of 2011-type jokes, (e.g. \u201cCryptic Dad is cryptic.\u201d) and I wonder if the humor will date itself in the future. In terms of plot, without spoilering the last book, Sophie, Jenna, and Cal go to England for the summer so Sophie can learn more about herself/her powers and spend time with her father. Aforementioned lame love interest Archer Cross has been sighted in England so it makes the situation more dangerous than it could be, as does the fact that L\u2019Occhio di Dio (The Eye) has been more actively attacking Prodigium all over the place. Also, someone is raising demons . That bites. Back to the love triangle. Archer is still all over the place in this one but I still didn\u2019t really enjoy him as a character. (view spoiler) [And what the eff is up with that open ending? Kill him off already. No, seriously, KILL HIM. If Sophie screws Cal over and picks Archer, I am checking out of this series. Okay, fine, maybe I\u2019ll still keep reading but I won\u2019t be happy about it! (hide spoiler) ] Every time Archer showed up, I secretly hoped someone would just walk by and kill him. I laughed about that one for a while\u2014imagining what books would be like if, out of the blue, some random person just showed up and killed a main character. Everything Cal does makes him more endearing, and there is a plot twist regarding him in the first few pages that surprised me and then left me a little frustrated throughout because there were several scenes dealing with it and I wish Sophie would just get over Archer. (view spoiler) [She doesn\u2019t. And the spoiler is that she and Cal have been betrothed for a few years. (hide spoiler) ] I said earlier that most of the book was interesting but not riveting. The last fourth or so of the book\u2014RIVETED. There is just tons of action going on and I flew through it. I would\u2019ve given this book 3 stars had it not been for the last section of the book. And that ending? Way to leave a series wide open, Rachel Hawkins . Who the hell knows where it will go next? I\u2019ll definitely be getting the next one. ...more Pre-<+++>Demonglass</+++>: Dang!

Post Demonglass: (SPOILERS TO HEX HALL, not this one though) What I feel like doing right now is crying while banging my head against the wall while laughing. I knew going into this book that it was going to end on a cliffhanger with the end coming at least a year away. Yet I read it anyway. I'm hopeing to be one of the many people I hated who got an ARC for the next one. 2012 will not get here soon enough. On to the book. So much happend, but I was happy with it. Sophie got some quality demon-time with dear old dad, found out who her betrothed was, met OTHER demons, and learned that not all monsters are technically monsters. They could be the good guys in disguise. Yeah, you heard me. Major twists are in this one. That's one thing I love about these books, I do not see the twists coming. In everything I read, I can predict what's about to happen. Yet I never saw Archer with the Eye (SOB) Sophie a demon, or the who the big evil people raising demons were. I also did not see the whole \"crushing on Sophie\" crush by one of the other characters featured in Hex Hall. Did not see that and nor do I get it much. I'm so Team Archer. Anyway, I just want everyone to go and enjoy. But, my little tibit of advice is this: wait as long as you can before reading it, cause the longer your wait for this one means the shorter and less aganonizing wait for the third and final Hex Hall. BTW: THANKS TO ALL who liked my review before this book came out. It totally made me feel special. ...more You know how sometimes you just take a totally irrational liking to a particular character, and when the story doesn't work out in their favour, you just want to throw the book away? Yeah, that's what happened to me with Demonglass. (Also, why is this book called Demonglass when the demonglass doesn't play any major role in the book?) Before I start the review, I want to make some things very clear. Objectively speaking, this is a great book, and very worthy of four stars. Sophie is still as sna You know how sometimes you just take a totally irrational liking to a particular character, and when the story doesn't work out in their favour, you just want to throw the book away? Yeah, that's what happened to me with Demonglass. (Also, why is this book called Demonglass when the demonglass doesn't play any major role in the book?) Before I start the review, I want to make some things very clear. Objectively speaking, this is a great book, and very worthy of four stars. Sophie is still as snarky and adorable as she was in Hex Hall. I'm a little bit in love with her father, and the plot has very many more twists and turns than the first book. It was an exciting, breathless read. SO what went wrong for me in Demonglass? Two words: Team Cal. I know, I know, it's crazy. How can I prefer the clean-cut All-American boy to the dark, troubled rebel? Wasn't I the one who admitted to having a secret weakness for starcrossed lovers? And Archer's so hot and Sophie's so in love with him! BUT. What can I say, I still like Cal better. I swear I'm not doing it to be perverse, I just think I would have liked the book about forty times more if Rachel Hawkins had decided to make Sophie get the hell over her crush on Archer, especially since she knows he's helping to kill hundreds of innocent Prodigium, and made her slowly fall in love with the kinder, more compassionate and infinitely more mature Cal. However, this is not my book, and since Rachel Hawkins has done a good job with the direction she has taken, I will grudgingly admit, despite my blind partiality for Cal, that the book works well.There is some great chemistry between Sophie and Archer, and I like the fact that Sophie doesn't miss him and think about because of how hot he is, but rather because she misses talking to him and hanging out with him. In Demonglass, Sophie finally meets her father, who persuades her to come to England to get to know him and learn more about her demon powers before going through with the Removal. She also discovers that she is betrothed to Cal, which makes for plenty of awkwardness. Sophie, Cal and Jenna go to England, where they also discover two other demon teenagers. Sophie discovers that the Prodigium is on the brink of war with the Eye and slowly begins to accept her powers, her future role as Head of the Council and her love for her father. Into the middle of this come several crises, including the reappearance of Archer in her life, the threat of someone raising demons and the knowledge that someone wants Sophie dead. This book is not as simplistic as Hex Hall. The humor and snark are still there, but you can see Sophie growing up to be a more mature, more astute person. Her growing relationship with her dad, a mixture of sarcasm, admiration and eventually, love, is great to see. While the first half of the book was fun and interesting, the second half was heart-poundingly good! The plot takes several unexpected twists and turns, and what I really liked about the ending is the fact that the villains are not cut-and-dried 'I want to be the most powerful person in the Prodigium' warmongers; instead, they believe their path is the only way to save the Prodigium. It's so rare to come across shades of grey in YA literature that I'm always glad to see even a hint of it. I have to admit that one of the things that really ticks me off is when strong heroines fall apart in crisis situations. I know it may be realistic and true-to-life, but personally, I like my kick-ass heroines to be kick-ass. This is one of the things that put me off Mockingjay, the fact that Katniss fell apart at the most crucial moment, the pivotal point at which her skill was most needed. I guess I think a heroine is only really strong if you show me she is, at the time she needs to be. Really strong people deal with things as they happen and give themselves the luxury of falling apart only later. So I was a little disappointed that Sophie ends up so passive at a point when she is supposed to be strong, and needs to lean on Cal after all. That's the sort of underlying reinforcement of the 'little woman' syndrome that makes me want to pull my hair out. As for the romance, the only thing I have left to say is that if Hawkins was going to fall into the Triangle Trap, the least she could have done was twisted it differently. However, I must admit I am curious to see where the story will go in the next book in the series, and all in all, this was a fun, exciting read. I would totally recommend it. ...more Still heaps of fun! I love a good paranormal book as much as the next person, but sometimes they take themselves too seriously.

Sophie is spending some time on her father's estate to figure out whether she's going to keep her awesome but pesky powers, and she's still secretly pining for her missing demon-hunter crush, Archer Cross. Complicating matters is the revelation that cute-as-heck Cal has been betrothed to her for years (hey, they do things differently in the otherworld) and the afore-mentioned crush is part of The Eye, a group hell-bent on wiping out all of Sophie's kind. Kinda puts a damper on the relationship. The politics and power struggles within the Prodigium (witches, shapeshifters, and fairies) and with the demon hunters is growing steadily more complicated, and Sophie and her father must develop her gifts before time runs out. It would be interesting to see more of the plotting ladies within the Prodigium and to have the tension ratcheted up with The Eye, but hopefully these will be further explored in future books. The author does a fabulous job of moving the story along with cheeky attitude, however, while taking time out for real connections between Sophie and her BFF Jenna and between her and her dad. There are also some brief but swoon-worthy moments with her guy, and you really breeze through this thing rooting for everyone to be happy. I'm really enjoying Sophie and her smart and snappy banter, and this series has fast turned into one of my fluffy and fun favorites.

We are back with Sophie who has spent the last few months trying to get over that fateful night she lost a lot. Her dad's back in the picture, her friend is dead, her beloved Archer is missing (or hiding). Whats a girl to do? Her dad shows up and suggests taking Sophie back to his house (or maybe not his house exactly) and she wants to bring Jenna with her. Her dad agrees and he also suggests a mystery guest as well. Who is the mystery guest? Cal! Remember Cal, he was the guy that was a few years older that stayed on campus when he graduated and more or less became the janitor. He heals people. Yep, that Cal. Why on earth is Cal coming I asked myself? Well, on page 18, I got my answer and I laughed so hard I thought I was going to cry. I loved that!!!! Of course leaving the school, Sophie gets a strange feeling that all 3 of them will not be returning. Sophie and her friends go back to the mansion aka Thorne Abbey. There they spend the next few months discovering secrets about Sophie's heritage, and just how powerful she really is. The Eye is still out to get her as well, and Archer shows up a lot throughout the book. Of course Sophie doesn't know who she should really trust. When it comes down to it, everyone seems hunky dory on the outside but Sophie starts wondering about her dad's \"friends,\" who Archer \"really\" is, and just how many people she can really trust. With a new set of characters, more intensity in Sophie's life, the fact that the school may not be what it seems, and the Eye out to kill her, Demonglass was a hit! Let me finish by saying this, I really liked Archer in the first book but after getting to know Cal, my feelings started leaning towards him and I desperately wanted something to really happen between Sophie and him. And everything he sacrificed made me feel so giddy I wanted to jump up and down with excitement. But of course she's still got it bad for Archer! How do you choose between a super powerful warlock and a hot older healer? Decisions, decisions. Demonglass was AWESOME! And of course it ends with such a cliffhanger that Demonglass will make people want to cry because as of right now, they can't run to the bookstore and get the next book! Write faster Hawkins! Overall: Loved Demonglass!!! Love Sophie, Cal, Jenna, Archer, her dad, just everyone!!! Cover: It's awesome. Love it. Its even nicer than Hex Hall! Beautiful cover!

But I couldn't get into the story... well, there actually didn't seem to be a whole lot of story. Basically, Sophie goes to hide out in the English countryside for family/demon bonding time, whilst all the time trying to half convince the reader that she's over her evil ex-crush Archer - but she has to do it in that pathetic pining way that lets you know that, not only is her mr sexy-traitorous guy still definitely on her mind, but she is also into that stage of obsessive love-you-till-I-die that seems to happen in so many young adult paranormal romance novels after the couple in question have had one kiss . At least they didn't quite have insta-love, that would have been too much to take. What we do get is the suggestion of the inevitable love triangle (why, oh, why) with Cal now the other potential love interest. Let's face it - probably not gonna happen. Cal appears to be (unfortunately, this comparison must be made) the Jacob Black of this piece, where Archer is the Edward Cullen (except he does actually have a personality). The author seems to be going down the road of: Archer = Great, never-ending love. Cal = cute, nice guy who will probably get dumped and end up turning into a pervert obsessed with newborn babies. Just forget it. This book wasn't interesting at all, we've moved away from the cool supernatural mysteries and gone into a story solely centred around love triangles and heartbreak.

Shocked, they will turn to their sarcastic, witty best friend and/or boy who is mean to them and will inevitably dry hump them in a later chapter and be all like \"W-what was that?\" To which the best friend/ dry humper will turn and look at them solemnly and say \"That, my dear, was what we call a Brummie.\" And then she recoils in fear. Not that I can mock anyone because of their accent\u2026. I make Shaun Ryder sound like Stephen Fry. I miss Hex Hall. Sigh. Some of the \u2018reveals\u2019 at the end\u2026hmmm, I'm not 100% sure. They have the potential to go either way. Also, this is probably because I read these two books within a week of each other, but the first few paragraphs were a bit \u2018 Do you remember what happens in the first book? You\u2026 you do? OK, good. Well\u2026 I\u2019m just going to tell you it again. Just in case. \u201d Heroine. Everything I have to say about Sophie I\u2019ve pretty much said. She was still consistent (well, until the end\u2026 which surprised me a little. It was really out of character\u2026 but don\u2019t worry guys\u2026 I looked at the page, shaking my head in disappointment. That\u2019ll learn 'er.) in her snarky, funny ways without bordering on wise-assery. I think Ms Hawkins did a great job with keeping Sophie as the character we all fell in love with in the first book but still allowing her to develop naturally. She did, however, lose some well-earned Brownie points with her simpering simperiness when it came to the boys in her life. Come on, Soph. Don\u2019t make me brand you as an AFP. Because once we go there\u2026 there\u2019s no way back. Pull it together, you\u2019re a demon for heaven\u2019s sake. If they\u2019re bothering you\u2026 zap them with your powers. Start with Archer\u2026 *shifty look* Love Interest. OK. *sigh* OK\u2026. Right. OK. Right well\u2026 in my mind Sophie has three options when it comes to love interest. (Three? Wait, that\u2019s the same number of points a triangle has. A LOVE TRIANGLE. *scowls*) Door Number One Fawn over Archer Cross, who is mean to her, needs to fall off a cliff and a completely random non-entity character that adds nothing to the plot except to confuse our heroine and make her lose her head and make stupid decisions that could, I don\u2019t know\u2026 KILL HER AND EVERYONE SHE HAS EVER LOVED. But.. he\u2019s, like, a dreamboat so that doesn't matter. Door Number Two Hope to god that Cal grows a pair and fights for her and doesn\u2019t just stand in the background doing sweet F.A until right at the end when he realises that\u2026 Whoops, you might lose her better do something quick to make her desire you. I really wish Hawkins would have written a few cute scenes between Cal and Sophie becauseI don\u2019t really see the connection between them\u2026. yet . Saying that though, out of the boys, I am rooting for Cal. Door Number Three. Decide she\u2019s sick of ridiculous boys who are either sarcastic boneheads or strong and so silent they practically don\u2019t exist (seriously, those are her options?! Poor Soph, even a werewolf and a vamp look pretty good right now) and decide to become a lesbian with Jenna and raise vampire ponies on a ranch in Texas. IMAGINE HOW FUN BOOK 3 WOULD BE. Did I mention Door Number Three is bright pink?! And you get a cupcake when you open the door. But you know.. whatever. It\u2019s your choice, Soph. Best Friend. WHAT. NOOO. COME ONNN. Papa Mercer. OK, I loved Papa M. I think Sophie\u2019s relationship with her dad was really realistic (or, y\u2019know.. for demons), heart-warming and funny. (I\u2019m glad to know that Sophie got her sarcasm from her British relatives) I think book three is going to be amazing in this respect\u2026 especially with what happened in the end. WHAT. NOOO. COME ONNN. Theme Tune. Abracadabra- Jessie J Dear Cal, I made you a mix tape. Of\u2026 um, one song. But yeah\u2026 this is exactly how I feel about you. Lots of love and broken plant pots, Sophie. Mmmm, I love the smell of wishful thinking in the morning early evening. Angst Level. 5/10. These points are for the ending which was all dramatic and exciting and WHAT. NOOO. COME ONNN. But yeah... apart from that, this book is a one way ticket to f-\u2026. I promised I wouldn\u2019t say that again didn\u2019t I? Fine. ..... ONE WAY TICKET TO FUN. I'm not even sorry.

S REVIEW FOR DEMONGLASS BY RACHEL HAWKINS *I'm very sorry if my opinions differ from everybody else's. I understand that we all have different opinions. Thank you for considering that. :) Demonglass was a disappointing novel after Hex Hall. I imagined more of the excellent character development that the previous book had, and an original plot and premise from the now cliched romance stories of today. Sadly, there was little, if none of that. Demonglass takes off right after the ending of Hex Hall. Sophie is moving to England for the summer, with her father, who she has never met until now. Coming along is Jenna and Cal, where very early on Sophie learns a worrying secret about. They spend the summer in troubling anxiety, learning that the Eye is getting closer than ever to the Council. While the plot had many twists and turns, they were gradual twist and turns. You had a crawling notion at the beginning of the book, and then at the end, your fears were confirmed. While many other books can do this expertly and still not lose interest in the reader, Demonglass tried, and failed in the process. There was also a lot less action than I wanted there to be, as there are only a few scenes in which the Eye and and the Council come together and fight. Most of the action appeared in the end, and by then, was long overdue. There are also a few tidbits of information throughout the book that are unnecessary and don't contribute to the plot at all. They were unneeded, and also a bit annoying. Sophie's personality was even less appeasing. Most of the book, she sounded like a selfish girl, meeting Archer, her love interest, even though she knew he was part of the Eye. I thought that was only there for romance sake, although some of it contributed to the plot. The romance itself was unrealistic between Archer and Sophie. Although they met and got to know each other in the first book, there are no real feelings in this one. I did not think the second book lived up at all to the first one. I hope the third book (as it is certain that there will be a third one) will be at least better than the second. ...more This is the sequel to Hex Hall .

While a young adult book, this one did not rub me in the annoying way the first book did at times. However this book did not really grab and easily hold my attention either. Easily put aside and forgotten. Especially the middle of the book. I struggled to get through it. Nick and Daisy do not help. They bored me. The first book in the series threw some unexpected twists throughout the book. This one not so much. That is not to say it was bad or I didn't enjoy it. Just that it didn't jump out at me. In this book, Sophie is sent off to spend the summer with her father. Lucky for her, Cal and Jenni get to go with her. She has a lot to learn about her heritage. From there, things go several directions at once and none of them play out in a way that drove my curiosity. I am liking Cal's character more and more. I think he is my favorite character in this series. He may seem like the quiet, healing gardener, but it is easy to tell there is more to him. I have mixed thoughts on Sophie's dad. He is too career focused but I think he has a good heart. The other new characters were disappointing. Now while much of the book was just so-so, the ending has me really wondering what is to come next. One cannot read this and just stop so kuddos for an amazing cliffhanger ending! Overall 3.5 stars ...more Rachel Hawkins did it again! This book is just as good as the first and I love it! In this sequel,Sophie meets her dad.I mean,really gets to know her dad and bonds with him in a unique way such as power developing/controlling. She also meets some more demons who didn't know/have no memories of why and how they existed. Sophie is also with Jenna(her bestfriend) here(I'm glad),and Cal who plays a more prominent role in this book. I wonder who would Sophie choose: the one she's bethroted to, or the on Rachel Hawkins did it again! This book is just as good as the first and I love it!

So you see,this book is getting more and more interesting! So hard to put down even when you're really busy. I just wish that when I read the third book,I could finish it in just one sitting..no distractions,no multi-tasking,no extra chores,no whatsoever!lol In other words,this series really is so entertaining! Got to get to the third book now!^^ ...more B-but Jenna....

La lettura non \u00e8 appesantita dalla questione amorosa, ma \u00e8 anzi brillante, divertente e sufficientemente misteriosa da farsi apprezzare e soprattutto da rilassarmi appieno, e questo \u00e8 un enorme pregio! Sophie si conferma essere una protagonista irriverente, ironica e simpatica, che sa affrontare pi\u00f9 di una situazione tutt\u2019altro che convenzionale sempre grazie all\u2019uso di battute mirate a sdrammatizzare e a far divertire il lettore. Certo, Sophie non \u00e8 una super eroina, spesso si perde in ragionamenti molto (troppo) adolescenziali ma grazie alla sua freschezza naturale, questi difettucci passano in secondo piano e la lettura si gusta appieno. Mi \u00e8 piaciuto pure il rapporto padre-figlia, si niente di cos\u00ec speciale, e forse un tantino superficiale (troppe questioni sono lasciate in sospese tra i due), ma d\u2019altronde \u00e8 anche adattissimo ad un libro del genere. In realt\u00e0 mi aspettavo molto di pi\u00f9 da Archer, volevo che dimostrasse tutta la sua magica figaggine e cos\u00ec non \u00e8 stato. Ma magari \u00e8 meglio, in fondo il suo rapporto con Sophie \u00e8 stato gestito con calma e calcolato alla perfezione e poi l\u2019autrice ha a disposizione tutto il terzo volume per farmi innamorare di lui...

I really enjoyed her character, her personality, her sarcasm and her charm. All through out the book, even the scenes are made to be serious, she never forgot to showcase her wit and snarky-ness, which made the scenes slightly light to manage, though I still sense the tension onto them. The plot has been managed to kept intact and went smoothly on the right pace. The character development are quite good too. I got the sense of their importance in the book. There are twists and revelations that constantly digging my mind when I'm reading this book. I mean I can't believe those were happen and those were the truth. Moreover, I had to admit that I am really entertained on the sweet-yet-snarky romance of Sophie and Archer. I always smile, sometimes laugh, when they are talking to each other and doing the other stuff. Hihi . And, I am also happy that Sophie and her Dad got their own quality time bonding with one another even their bonding moments were dangerous and demonic in nature. This is really an entertaining book. I didn't feel boredom or something. ...more Fans of HEX HALL are going to love the way the story develops in DEMONGLASS. There's breathless action, and even more breathless, swoony romance, and a cliffhanger that made me both want to high five Rachel Hawkins and also, maybe yell at her a little. No spoilers here. Y'all are going to have to wait until March:) He laughed softly. \"I can't see you, but I have a feeling you're cute when you're jealous, Mercer.\" Well, damn! I must say....one minute I was getting very, very bored, and the next, I was gasping and covering my mouth with one hand due to the dramatic occurrences unraveling before me. I think this is one of those situations where, while the second book was super good, it lacked a little of my favorite character....and let me correct you before you make unfair assumptions-I am not that girl wh He laughed softly. \"I can't see you, but I have a feeling you're cute when you're jealous, Mercer.\" Well, damn! I must say....one minute I was getting very, very bored, and the next, I was gasping and covering my mouth with one hand due to the dramatic occurrences unraveling before me. I think this is one of those situations where, while the second book was super good, it lacked a little of my favorite character....and let me correct you before you make unfair assumptions-I am not that girl who rates based on whether the male lead is wholly present or not (see above^^^^^my rating is clear), but if the story can't stand on it's own, that's when I will squeal about the lack of that male presence. I have to say that I abhor when certain reviewers rate lowly due to lack of the male lead-you know who you are-and don't base the rating solely on the story's merit or action. If you are one of these people, that's okay! It's your right , but I will not trust your reviews as they are...there is more to a story than *gasp* a hot dude. Now, even on my profile it says I will give any book with a 'smidgen of romance' a try-and maybe that makes me biased-but that's my prerogative...take it or leave it. For the first time in a long time, I let myself remember Archer, really remember him. His brown eyes and slow smile. His laugh, and how I felt when I was with him. How his voice sounded when he called me \"Mercer.\" The way he had kissed me. I don't know why I felt I needed to say that above. Maybe it's to defend this particular book's honor against some of the negative reviews it received, or maybe it's because too many of my favorite books and/or series have been bashed and rated poorly because the male is not present. Well, it's bullshit, and too many excellent and expertly written novels get bashed all because of the 'second book formula'. It's that damn routine where something epic happens at the end of book one (or, hey. NEAR the end) and then we see minimal guy time in the next. It almost always happens in trilogies, as far as I've seen, and it is a tad aggravating that it inevitably seems to occur frequently, but I also kind of like it in a weird, messed up way. \"It just seems like overkill when you already have a dagger and I have superpowerful magic at my disposal.\" \"Superpowerful?\" He stood up, a gold chain dangling from his fingers. \"Let me remind you of two words, Mercer: Bad. Dog. \" I was one of those (before GR, B.G., if you will) that read the sappy, inevitable HEA, cliche, cookie-cutter, and overdone romances that are so common these days. Maybe that's why I cringe when someone asks me to read a NA with no paranormal or dystopian or even a little fantasy in it-I NEEEEED that peril, I NEEEEEED that action, I NEEEED some angst and kick-ass situations. I've read all the cookie-cutters, bring on the pain. Anyways, wow, this is turning into a impromptu bio, that is why I have grown tolerant, if not a little fond, of male absences or sticky situations where the hero/heroine are separated for a time because, well, I've found that absence, both in real life and even more so in books, makes the heart grow fonder. ...I turned away, but he reached out and caught my wrist. I could feel my pulse hammering under his fingers. \"Mercer, that day in the cellar...\" He searched my face, and I could sense him struggling for what he wanted to say. Then finally, \"I didn't kiss you back because I had to. I kissed you because I wanted to.\" His eyes dropped to my lips, and it was like the whole world had shrunk to just me and him and the shaft of light between us. \"I still want to,\" he said hoarsely. So, I think it's quite clear what I'm trying to say here-there were definitely some moments where Archer was severely missed and I was a tad bored by the story, but in no way did it hinder my love for this series and it only made the story that much better when he was in it. That's what happens when the author chooses to separate the leads-it makes the story stronger when they are reunited. ...\"Let me guess,\" I hissed, nodding at the chain. \"Something else you stole from Hex Hall.\" He pushed himself to his feet. \"Guilty.\" \"Where the heck was I while you were playing Grand Theft Cellar?\" I believe it goes without saying that I adore Archer and everything Archer-ly inclined, so I will just say that he is, if possible, sweeter, hotter, and even more endearing in book two-quite swoon-worthy I must say. And then there's Jenna, her vampire best friend. I didn't love her as much, but in the end, when it mattered most, she came through and was supportive of her best friend and that's what mattered most. It warmed my heart and brought me back to her side...not that I was ever on the opposite. He shook his head. \"That's not what I meant. I wish we weren't like this. You know, demon, demon-hunter. I wish I'd met you in a normal high school, and taken you on normal dates, and like, carried your books or something.\" Glancing over at me, he squinted and asked, \"Is that a thing humans actually do?\" And finally-the elephant in the room that is a love triangle. I do believe this was a baby one, not even to really be considered, but I have to put it out there and shelve it thusly. We have a new contender, kind of, for Sophie's heart, and while he is both sweet and kind and even a tad smexy, he is not Archer- no contest. I'm even going to go so far as to say that I bet you know who this not-so-mystery man is, but as it is, I won't mention him further. It sucks that we miss people like that. You think you've accepted that someone is out of your life, that you've grieved and it's over, and then bam. One little thing and you feel like you've lost that person all over again. (I SWEAR that is SUCH a coincidence that this quote was one of the chosen ones lmao-I rarely use the word bam-must have been fate) A great read, if a little dull at times, and then a BAM -tastic ending. I love when they are crazy and out of the blue-no one is safe, and no one sees it coming. Those are the absolute best endings and they offer so much more than the prophesied or predictable endings-those are good sometimes, too, but they just aren't as...BAM. I don't know how else to say it lol. You're walking down the street, minding your own business...then BAM! Bus? lol (Friends shout out muahaha) So yeah. If you loved or even liked the first book, you'll likely adore this one if you give it time to marinate and progress-I often find the best books have the most 'killer' endings, don't ya think? \"Cross,\" I started to say, but then his eyes slid past me and went wide with horror. At the same time, I became aware of a slithering noise behind me. That just could not be good; in my experience, nothing pleasant slithers. Still, I was not prepared for the nightmares climbing out of the crater.

Primero antes que nada: Ese final\u2026 ese final . Dios m\u00edo. La historia se pone cada vez mejor, tengo que admitir que me gust\u00f3 mucho m\u00e1s esta segunda parte que la primera. Principalmente porque deja a un lado toda esa \u201dintroducci\u00f3n\u201d de la saga y se aboca en la acci\u00f3n. Los problemas que surgen en esta parte son mucho m\u00e1s entretenidos y mucho m\u00e1s oscuros\u2026s\u00ed, realmente mucho m\u00e1s oscuros. Al principio no sab\u00eda qu\u00e9 pensar, todo era muy\u2026raro pero, despu\u00e9s, cada cosa toma su lugar. Quiz\u00e1s quedaron algunas cosas \u201ccolgadas\u201d como por ejemplo la historia de este Concejo o cu\u00e1les son sus normas\u2026en fin, supongo que todo eso se detallar\u00e1 un poco m\u00e1s en Spell Bound Est\u00e1 narrado en 1\u00ba persona por Sophie y tengo que reconocer que esta chica es muy sarc\u00e1stica . A pesar de que algunas de sus \u201crespuestas\u201d son muy contempor\u00e1neas te divierten y te hacen re\u00edr y eso es lo que la caracteriza. Es joven, sarc\u00e1stica e impulsiva y eso me gust\u00f3 aunque hubo una parte del libro en el que quer\u00eda pegarle un cachetazo pero se encamino r\u00e1pidamente y,otra vez,me cay\u00f3 de lujo. Los personajes nuevos y no tan nuevos me gustaron. Tengo que aclarar que me encanta Archer . S\u00e9 que es el enemigo pero es que\u2026sigue siendo el Cross que conocimos en el s\u00f3tano de Hex hall cuando tuvo que hacer con Sophie el trabajo extra por el castigo de la Vandy. Jenna me sigue pareciendo lo m\u00e1ximo y a pesar de que en un momento se sali\u00f3 de la l\u00ednea y me pareci\u00f3 algo ego\u00edsta, la entiendo\u2026es lo que ella merece. Cal me ha encantado , si ya me gustaba antes imaginen ahora. Sin dudas es todav\u00eda un misterio pero ya lo vamos a conocer realmente, no se preocupen. Otro que quiero destacar es El padre de Sophie . Me encant\u00f3 este hombre, sobre todo porque Sophie nos lo hizo imaginar como un hombre a lo \"Mr. Darcy\" y en realidad es un hombre com\u00fan y corriente (s\u00ed, con sangre de demonio pero \"com\u00fan y corriente igualmente\"). No quiero comentar sobre el resto porque bueno\u2026estar\u00eda spoileando. Tengo que aclarar que hay cosas que no me siguen cerrando como por ejemplo: \u00bfEs que nadie le pone un tutor a Sophie para que practique magia? De verdad, pobre chica\u2026tanto poder y est\u00e1 s\u00faper perdida tratando de controlarlo. Otra de las cosas es la seguridad, \u00bfNo hay seguridad?

Well, that I can\u2019t say but I will say that Cal fans will be delighted with the new developments surrounding his character (I know I was over the moon thrilled!). I was happy to see more of Cal\u2019s character. He definitely plays a bigger part in this book. There were twists and turns in Demonglass that I didn\u2019t see coming! Well played Ms. Hawkins, well played. I was OMGing and squeeing like a little girl. Just when you think you know what\u2019s going on, the author opens up a new door. Demonglass is full of mystery and suspense. There\u2019s also a bit of a love triangle going on, new characters added to the mix, and more truths unfold. And then, you\u2019re left with one hell of a cliffhanger! What I Didn\u2019t Like: Not a damn thing. Well, other than I have to wait a year for the next book. That\u2019s just pure torture! Overall Impression: If you thought Hex Hall was good, then you\u2019ll love Demonglass . I didn\u2019t think the second book would surpass the first but it definitely did. I am now left anxiously awaiting the release of the 3rd book in this series. You won\u2019t put this one down until you\u2019re done. Demonglass is truly an amazing and fun read. ...more You can't trust a single character in these books smh. Oh I love this character! Oh wait no they are a murderer.. Oh but this character! Nope.. They are a traitor.. This character seems loveable! Haha ok they died great. The only character I can trust is Sophie but she is the queen of bad decisions so maybe I can't trust her for long. This book was a great sequel! But the betrayal man... The betrayal in this was worse than the 1st book! Six Words: I NEED THE NEXT BOOK NOW!!!!!! Nope, that doesn't cover everything. Another four words: I LOVE ARCHER CROSS!!!!!! Oh my... what an amazing book! Be careful, don't start reading this one unless you already have Spell Bound. Trust me. In Demonglass we follow Sophie to her trip in London the summer right after everything in the first book happened. Accompanied by her best friend, the vampire, Jenna and her betrothal Cal, as we soon discover, Sophie visits Thorne Abbey, the place where her father lives and her Grandmother Alice was turned into a demon.

In Demonglass we follow Sophie to her trip in London the summer right after everything in the first book happened. Accompanied by her best friend, the vampire, Jenna and her betrothal Cal, as we soon discover, Sophie visits Thorne Abbey, the place where her father lives and her Grandmother Alice was turned into a demon. But what she finds there is even more surprising than she expected, there are other two demon-kids living in Thorne Abbey along with few of the Councils members. Sophie will try to find as much as she can about the two other demons, her father, the history behind Alice's transformation and of course herself, all the while running from the Eye and discovering who is actually raising all these demons. This book was AMAZING. I was a little sad that it wouldn't take place at Hex Hall, I really loved that school, but still it was amazing. Everything I was expecting, action, drama, sarcasm and a lot of surprises, both good and bad along the way. After reading halfway through the book I couldn't stop there was so much going on, so many new discoveries and secrets revealed and so much yet to be discovered. As always I loved Sophie and her sarcasm, this girl had me laughing every other sentence. And Archer, oh Archer, how much I missed you! I was really glad he was back. All the moments he spend with Sophie were simply magical. I can't really say anything else about this book cause I am afraid I would just start posting spoilers. I mean... I am still socked from the ending. Massive CLIFFHANGER. You have been warned! ...more Un tr\u00e8s bon tome 2 !

Fue una buena movida de Hawkins, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n estuvo bueno que cambiara el lugar de la acci\u00f3n. No repondr\u00e9 mucho argumento porque creo que la sinopsis de esta edici\u00f3n ya lo resume bien, aunque creo que tambi\u00e9n da informaci\u00f3n que no deber\u00edamos saber desde que empezamos a leer. Lo importante es que Sophie va a pasar las vacaciones con su padre en Londres y conocer\u00e1 al Concilio, antes de someterse (o no) a la Extracci\u00f3n. Obviamente, esto le causa dilemas porque sabe que Archer, el enemigo m\u00e1s chechi (?) del universo Prodigium, anda merodeando por ah\u00ed. \u00bfCu\u00e1les son los puntos a favor? La trama ya no es tan simple y los personajes la acompa\u00f1an en esa evoluci\u00f3n. Los que ya conocemos salen (lentamente, pero lo hacen) del irritante estereotipo y presentan algunos giros muy interesantes, sobre todo en el final. Los nuevos (como el padre de Sophie y los miembros del Concilio) le aportan aire fresco porque, al menos, no se rozan con personajes de otras sagas. Hay temas lo suficientemente rebuscados como para que un libro juvenil no sea simplemente la copia de otro. La creaci\u00f3n de demonios es cosa seria, sobre todo porque ni siquiera dentro de ese mundo son bienvenidos, debido a su inestabilidad. Y vaya que habr\u00e1 muestras de aquello\u2026 No puedo dejar de mencionar que me pareci\u00f3 que Desaf\u00edo (nada que ver con el t\u00edtulo original) est\u00e1 mejor escrito que el anterior, aunque con algunas falencias. Le falta una estrella porque, hablando de falencias, las descripciones de las locaciones no me gustaron. Lo \u00fanico que percib\u00ed fue que todo era enorme y lujoso: el jarr\u00f3n de ac\u00e1 es m\u00e1s grande, m\u00e1s bonito y m\u00e1s elegante que el de all\u00e1. Al usarse la primera persona, hay muchas partes como esas (adem\u00e1s de las situaciones) en que se imprime el humor de Sophie y llega a sonar o muy cansino o muy superficial. No estoy diciendo que siempre sea as\u00ed porque, de hecho, Sophie se vuelve mejor narradora (y, por ende, mejor personaje) en este libro. Hab\u00eda un cerebro dentro de la chica que se preocupaba hasta el hartazgo por un vestido. (view spoiler) [ Tampoco me gust\u00f3 que haya trazos finos de un tri\u00e1ngulo amoroso. A pesar de que Sophie no da signos de estar insegura, la forma en que irrumpe Cal en varias ocasiones me da la sensaci\u00f3n de que algo va a pasar en el pr\u00f3ximo. La escena de Sophie, Cal y Archer en el molino me hizo acordar a la escena de la carpa en Eclipse \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 el tr\u00edo del amor siempre queda encerrado en alg\u00fan lugar por el bien de la chica? Argh. (hide spoiler) ] En fin, la pas\u00e9 muy bien leyendo Desaf\u00edo, a tal punto que no demor\u00e9 nada en terminarlo. El final est\u00e1 muy bueno y te obliga sin compasi\u00f3n a buscar el tercero para comenzarlo. ...more This book was great!

Sophie is an awesome character, a badass chick with some scary whoa-powers, and Jenna, her best friend who happens to be a vampire, also awesome (and she's totally an 'out' lesbian with a girlfriend and everything!). Aside from the awesomeness of non-male main characters, Sophie's sarcastic wit and commentary are AMAZING! For example, the following phrases are actually printed in this book: \"face touchage\" \"lame-sauce\" \"Sulky McSulkerton\" su-weet. As for witty humor and sarcastic phrasology, also numerous and laugh-out-loud worthy: \"'Irish girls, red hair,' I replied, remembering a picture of them from Mrs. Casnoff's 'People Who Want to Kill Us All' lecture at Hex Hall last year.\" \"'I [dad] spent hours on the phone. Do you know with whom?' 'One of those psychic hotlines?' Dad gritted his teeth. 'If only...'\" \"'Cryptic Dad is cryptic,' I muttered ... We'd hung out all day today. Was there no time in there he could have said, 'Oh, hey, meet me at the magical bookcase at the butt-crack of dawn tomorrow, cool?'\" \"'Dad, she's just going to freak. And probably come here and get me, and then you guys will start yelling at each other, and I'll have to act out by wearing lots of eyeliner and doing the drugs ...'\" \"I expected him to do his usual thing of 'Oh, Sophie, but that is impossible b/c of this big word, and that big word, and also this abstract concept.'\" And so much more! It's great! In closing: Read this book. Get on board with the Hex Hall series, it's just so cool it'll \"hurt your feelings\" (as one witty co-worker recently said). ...more Right, so this one wasn't a favorite.

I read it because I liked Hex Hall , the characters of Sophie as well as Cal and thought to give Demonglass a try, but this second installment certainly did not meet my expectations. I don't understand what some of my friends on here mean when they say it was awesome/better than Hex Hall because it lacked a lot of things in my opinion. Rating: 2 Setting: Hawkins did not take advantage of her setting at all , in my opinion, and made little of it accessible to the reader; talking about things that didn't seem to matter and adamantly so strung up on the gilt that I thought I would not make it through the read if I heard about one more naked cupid. There were flipping golden naked cherubs and golden geese that I did not care about, everywhere . How unfortunate. I wanted to see what Sophie did in London , and personally not a fan of Archer, did not appreciate in the slightest how he dominated most of this book. There was little talk of actual scenery because Sophie hardly traversed passed her doorpost, moping about Mr. Cross or doing something else pointless, and needless to say, there really was no point in dragging gorgeous Cal along at all. Because the only thing that really mattered were those infernal fountains, gilt decorations and greenery. Like really, if I wanted parks and annoying birds? I would visit the park next door. It may come across as strange, but I read escape literature to escape , oh-and I hate the park. Just saying. With that out of the way, I can only say that the setting was very uninspiring, and half the time I was reading back to make sure I got things right; it was that hard to understand. The descriptions were very elementary and the prose so angsty I did not trust that the person I was reading about could be the same Sophie who captured my interest a book ago, she was replaced by an immature girl who did not seem to grasp more than, (and let alone), what was right before her. Characters: Cal was amazing, I really like him and for the 30 total pages or less that the author allowed me to read of him, I was hooked. However, it seemed strange and utterly ludicrous that one would fly a hot babe/warlock out of the country - and to blooming England - just to stick him in a Greenhouse . A true travesty. I would have known what to do with Cal, and if I found myself so inclined to think of Archer, I would have done so when not with Cal. Being the resident hottie, he was never really there except to be used/abused by Sophie and heal liver-worm infested plants. Boy should have stayed at Hex Hall. Archer, as always, evoked luke-warm feelings from me. I liked him once, before he was an Eye that is, and I get that I'm supposed to care that he risked what was it again? something for Sophie, but he's shifty and too country-club-esque of a guy for me to devote more than an eyelash worth of attention his way. Sophie and I disagree on that matter, because all she ever does is Archer-mull and it got tired very fast. Plus she is constantly pointing out how sarcastic she is, which completely defeats the purpose. ---- Sophie, into the book: Oh my gosh, I am so fantastically sarcastic, I wonder if they got that I was sarcastic? Sophie mid-way through: I think they did, ooh let me say something else equally \"witty\", I got them that time! That comment was so deadpan, I outdo myself sometimes, I am so awesome. *moment of reflection*: Oh Archer, come back to me...I'm sarcastic. Want me, baby. I'll blow you away with my fauxe nonchalance. ---- That was what being inside her head felt like and I wanted out 96%, while the other 4% I was consequently asleep. It really bombs that this entire work is first person. Shoot. The other characters, such as her father, the Casnoff's and the wannabe Council could have not existed. Her Dad was okay but largely underdeveloped, the same goes for Nick and Daisy. There could have been something more to them, but Hawkins invested too great of time elsewhere to be concerned at all with the other characters in possession of actual potential. Also, what was the point in bringing \"Vix\" to the Council headquarters? The diversion she was designed to create never worked for me because Sophie did not spend much time with her dad other than that breaking and entering incident, and the property vandalism, both of which he carefully planned beforehand. Way to go Daddy! Plot: Was so crazily predictable that halfway through I knew who the villains were, and just pointing out, hated that Hawkins sacrificed every bit of prior characterization to make a couple twist happen. Why do that at all, I wonder? It was very unreliable on her part because the personality and expectations carved for certain characters came to a complete waste, forgone all for the sake of an ineffective attempt at thrill. P.A.: Problem areas include poor characterization, blatant inconsistencies, magnanimous repetitiveness and of course, sad predictability; all of which I can believe may be fixed in the following novel. Hopefully. Oh, but I forgot the cheesiness of the H.S.M. 3-like dialogue. Ohh the horror! I gagged at the \"Mercer\", \"Cross\", bits of exchange! W.T.F.?? What was that? Really, what was that?! I watched High School Musical 3 because I love to punish myself, the second one was bearable and I thought (stupidly), that seeing the last one through can't hurt! But, oh it did. Vanessa freaking Hudgens would not end with the \"Wildcat\" references to Troy, substituting the name of the team he wanted to leave behind for his given birth. I cringed, I cried, I begged. They didn't let me out of the theatre until the very end and by then the damage was done. I had spasms all through the parts of their \"pet-names\" during my trek through Demonglass and my eyes now twitch at mere mention of \"Mercer.\" I should see a doctor; I'll book my appointment and while I'm at it, see if possibly there is a disease such as having a forbearance to cheesiness. If so, I have contracted it. H.M.: Honorable mention goes to no one. I loved Cal and still do, but there was no one truly deserving of the title :*( . It appears it truly takes more than a hunk with soothing powers (literally) to fix a book. Who knew? So I give this one a 2 and not a three if some of you thought so, I can't do that, not when this book suffers from the curse of the 2nd book. But I will read the third because I want to see this through, and like with H.S.M. 1-3, I am a glutton for punishment. ...more", "Title": "Demonglass"},
