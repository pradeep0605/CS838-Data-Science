They\u2019re written realistically, I mean I feel like I know them, flaws and all and I usually want to move to whatever town it is he\u2019s describing. Sure sometimes the stories are predictable and I find that the couple de jour spouts the \u201cI love you\u2019s\u201d too soon for my liking or realism\u2019s sake but still his stories are always a pleasure to read, which is what keeps me coming back for more. A BEND IN THE ROAD was a surprise in that it keeps a sense of mystery going throughout, often leaving the main couples love story and allowing us into the mind of the anonymous \u201cbad guy\u201d. Slowly unravelling their story until the shocking big reveal at the end. I honestly didn\u2019t know how Sparks was going to wrap things up here, his couples doesn\u2019t always end up together and that too added to the mystery. Sheriff\u2019s deputy Miles Ryan is still struggling to come to terms with the death of his beloved wife in a hit-and-run accident nearly two years ago. High school sweethearts, theirs was a love destined to last and Miles can\u2019t seem to let go of the grief or the fact that as an officer of the law he\u2019s been unable to find the person responsible. If it weren\u2019t for their young son Jonah it\u2019s unlikely that Miles would find the strength to get through the day. Which brings into play Jonah\u2019s second grade teacher Sarah Andrews. When Jonah begins having trouble keeping up in school Sarah offers to tutor him and a tentative relationship begins to form. Sarah is running away from a bad divorce (is there a good one?) and has a few skeletons in her closet as well. Our couple fall in love pretty fast (from one page to the next) and are just beginning to see a real future together when Miles\u2019 past comes back, tearing everything apart. Unwilling to let go of his dead wife and obsessed with finding her killer and ultimately closure I can honestly say that I was surprised by events I didn\u2019t see coming. As I hinted at earlier I really enjoyed getting inside the head of the hit-and-run driver and slowly discovering who it was, becoming very sympathetic towards their situation. However I could have done without spending so much time running around with county sheriff Charlie and subsequently the middle parts of this story lagged. Still a recommended read.

He had the flashbacks and constant memories that we all have when going through grief. This aspect of the book was excellent and could not be faulted. Whilst I loved the character of Sarah I struggled to make that emotional connection to Miles. For me I found him to be a little bit of a typical macho kind of guy and that at times annoyed me. I will say however that it is possible that I had this issue because I listened to this book on audio and sometimes the droning of characters can get on your nerves. This is however the reason I gave the book a rating of 3 (although, it would be 3 1/2 if it where possible) and not higher, I just didn't fall in love with the main character the way that I wanted to. ...more 3+ Svi znaju za Milesa i Missy.

A Bend in the Road is about the intersecting lives of Miles Ryan, one of the town's deputies who's lost his wife in a hit and run accident about two years and is now raising his only son Jonah, and Jonah's teacher and recently divorcee Sarah Andrews. Obviously they fall in love, and obstacles, this would be where the 'bend' in the road occurs, fall in their way in this tale of forgiveness and romance. *gag* Right, so I was recommended this book by my co-worker who I made read the Hunger Games, and A Bend in the Road is about the intersecting lives of Miles Ryan, one of the town's deputies who's lost his wife in a hit and run accident about two years and is now raising his only son Jonah, and Jonah's teacher and recently divorcee Sarah Andrews. Obviously they fall in love, and obstacles, this would be where the 'bend' in the road occurs, fall in their way in this tale of forgiveness and romance. *gag* Right, so I was recommended this book by my co-worker who I made read the Hunger Games, and wanted to see what I'd think of a book she really liked. Well. So the book isn't absolutely terrible. The romance is overthetop cheesy, the writing makes me die, and I just didn't care throughout the whole thing. But there were moments where I was entranced, and I liked the book to some degree. I won't be reading anything else by Sparks, probably, but hey it was fun. For entertainment purposes only, here are two things that I noticed were a bit abundant throughout the novel: A. Everyone smells everyone's hair. Especially Jonah's. SURPRISINGLY they all smell like SHAMPOO. Who'd thunk it? Also, that's kind of weird, shampoo shouldn't be that strong, I think anyway. B. EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. IN. THIS. DAMN. BOOK. RUNS. THEIR. FINGERS. THROUGH. THEIR. HAIR. Seriously! Miles is the worst at it, I can't count the number of times he 'runs his fingers through his hair' and it fluffed up or something like that. I started imagining him with an afro just to get through those parts. I know characters have ticks, bitting their nails, etc... but, and my creative writing prof has told me this SO MANY TIMES, there's a limit. Please. Please. PLEASEFORTHELOVEOFGOD. Don't go over it. So the story by itself isn't too shabby a piece of work. It pretty much follows the usual romance formula of getting together, evil story element involving past breaking them apart, and then forgiveness, etc... There's a good amount of mystery, and while it's pretty much predictable, it keeps the story flowing. The one thing that did bother me about the plot (and this has to do with the romance as well) is the fact it wasn't a harlequin novel. I know, I usually rant about things that are too harlequin standard plot, but I felt there was a definite lack of a certain event that usual occurs in a harlequin. Yes, people, I'm talking about the sex scene. Maybe I should be a bit more specific. Yes, there was a sex scene in this novel, just like there was a sex scene in Breaking Dawn. Both of them sadly play that fade to black thing, and well..it kinda sucks. Cuz you know sex scenes are kinda fun to read, and also the reason why I read adult romances. :P Ha. No, but seriously having that fade to black thing was a bit of a letdown for me. The whole romance in particular was actually kind of a letdown, not only because it was kind of cheesy and had lots of mushy stuff and more of that OMGSOHOT moments, but because the author kind of paints their relationship sort of saint like. The best example of this is that they pretty much tell each other they love each other before they ever kiss. Seriously? I think I've read more riskay stuff in YA novels. I'm an adult, I'm pretty sure I can handle a little lust. Please don't belittle me by making a romance seem so perfect. Relationships aren't like that, because people aren't like that, so don't take the time to make this a I'VE FOUND MY SOUL MATE, NOW WE CAN LIVE FOREVER AND EVER TWILIGHT STYLE. It isn't real. And I don't like it. The writing, as I've mentioned, is perhaps in addition to the romance one of the worst things about this book. So most of the book is written in 3rd person and changes between characters, which isn't bad. At best it's decent, as they're nothing really special about it, and most of it is riddled with cliches. But it works, and keeps the story going, so I can't really condemn it. While I didn't care for the writing, I have to admit that it wasn't the 3rd person that drove me nuts, but the 1st person infrequent chapters told from the point of view of the hit and runner. *Sigh* This is going to sound very very mean, but the 1st person writing really was some of the worst I'd ever read. I think I wrote better stuff when I was 13 or so. I don't know what it was, I can't pinpoint what I felt was wrong with it, but it was just awkward, and urk. I can't explain it, but as soon as I started to read it, I wanted to run away from the book as fast as I could. Odd, I know, but an utter turn off for me. All in all, A Bend in the Road isn't a bad book. There's a good enough plot, and plenty to entertain. It's not, however, a great, or even possibly a good book. The romance is just lame, the writing is barely decent, and it makes me wonder why and how Sparks makes a living off this stuff.

IMHO, here are my random thoughts: Brian's character needed to be more fleshed out....I found myself feeling somewhere between loathsome and pity for him and not because we got to know him as a real person, but strictly because of his actions explained from Missy's death forward. As this was the \"big twist\" of the book (which I figured out half way through anyhow), I really desired to know more about what drove Brian to react to the accident the way he did. Running off at the scene was completely believable, but stalking the family for a year while hiding in trees, carrying binoculars, watching Miles' son Jonah play at school, and then saying nothing for two years? A bit creepy to me? He obviously needed some serious therapy and there wasn't the slightest nod to this, just fast forward a decade and he's happily married, saving lives in the ER, and just like that he's healthy, healed, and hopeful for the future? A bit hard for me to buy into without more explanation of his journey toward healing, departing from his stalking days, and what the hell was he like before he accidentally killed Missy (saying he was shy and introverted fell short, way short)? So aside from that, I adored Sarah and Jonah and even Sarah's annoying mother. Miles was easy to fall in love with until his rage took over a long three years after his wife's death and meeting the second love of his life - again difficult for me to buy into after seeing his actions begin to reflect a sense of letting go and moving on for himself and his son in the first half of the book. He too obviously needed some serious therapy (obsessing over Missy's supposed \"killer\" as an almost nightly ritual) and not once did he apologize to Sarah for jumping the gun (no pun intended) accusing her of deceit after all of the tender moments and self-truths they shared. I wanted to smack him upside the head....lol. The brief ending of Sarah seeing Miles return to her, thank God, helped to uplift my waning enthusiasm somewhat in end. But even then, I wanted to see some sort of final dialogue between these two main characters to show that Miles was able to come to the realization that as he lost his wife (Missy), Sarah too, in a way lost someone irrevocably, her brother's innocence coupled with a forever tarnished future for both her brother and herself, knowing that Miles' loss was caused by someone she deeply loved. ...more What does a man do when the love of his life is killed by a hit and run driver while jogging?

She develops a fondness for Jonah and feels an attraction to the handsome sheriff, whom she starts dating. Before long she realizes she is falling in love with Miles, though she knows a relationship is unlikely for he is still in love with his dead wife. But Miles is surprised to find himself falling for Sarah and plans to spend the rest of his life with her. One night while on patrol, Miles arrests a local for drunk driving. Because this man is on parole, knowing he'll be sent back to jail, he tells Miles he knows who killed Missy, but won't impart that information unless Miles lets him off. Though it was wrong, but needing to know the truth about Missy's death, Miles goes against the rules to get this information. Only thing, the information is wrong and Miles goes after the wrong man--a man who has been a thorn in his side for years. While Miles is seeking vengeance, Sarah learns the truth and realizes she must tell him, but knows that by doing so would kill any chance for them.

Miles became a complete monster after he started to focus on the case once more and I half-thought that Sarah would end up breaking up with him because he threatened to be violent. Of course she stood by him because this is after a Nicholas Sparks novel filled to the brim with steadfast true love. The book had that \"expect the unexpected\" quality which didn't quite work out. Because of the lack of characters you can have the \"killer\" pegged almost right off the bat. It bothers me that so many of Nicholas Spark's books are set in this \"small town\" of New Bern. If it's such a small town do all the characters know each other? I just wish there would be a change of setting. Finally everything about this novel is soooo cliche!

Thanks, Nick. ...more Nicholas Sparks does it again with A Bend in the Road .

Jonah's teacher is the sweet and of course single Sarah Andrews who has recently gone through a heart-breaking divorce. They hit if off and soon they are falling in love. I enjoyed A Bend in the Road . Although it was like a typical romance novel - fluffy, sweet, and has characters that are characterized entirely by their past heartbreak, it was still a good book. Sparks writing style doesn't utilize overly excessive romance terms, and is concise and to the point. The mystery was actually intriguing and the development of Jonah was cute. I just wish it was a little more original. ...more It took a while for me to finish this one. In the beginning I really liked the story and thought I would finish it quickly. It turned out to be the opposit. I don't know what it is with me but I like to do all kind of others things at the moment than read. The story was okay, not as tear-jerking as other stories I've read of Nicholas. Was surprised by the outcome eventually! All in all a nice read :-) I found the book slow in the beginning. I was kind of bored when it was describing Miles' daily life after his wife died. It started to get more interesting when Miles meets his son's teacher. When the author described the different perspectives, like the person that did a hit-and-run on Miles' wife. M\u00e1s bien un tres y medio tirando a cuatro :) A veces, sencillamente, lees lo que tu alma necesita en ese momento. Es una comuni\u00f3n \u00fanica, una lazo invisible que anhela como un suave b\u00e1lsamo esas palabras escritas, que tus ojos recorren. No voy a decir que esta sea una gran novela, ni que se me ha encogido el coraz\u00f3n, no, pero, como he dicho al principio, una a veces solo necesita una suave ola de calor. A Bend in the Road is a book that comes from a story line of tragedy to the positive things that are the outcome. Miles Ryan seemed to shut down the day is wife was killed in a hit-and-run accident. They have a son Jonah together who has some challenging issues he faces. Miles longs to bring his wife's killer to justice but the case has been open for a while and they have yet to have a suspect.

Miles Ryan seemed to shut down the day is wife was killed in a hit-and-run accident. They have a son Jonah together who has some challenging issues he faces. Miles longs to bring his wife's killer to justice but the case has been open for a while and they have yet to have a suspect. Miles and Jonah live in a small warming community where everyone knows everybody. When Jonah starts second grade his new teacher, Sarah, teaches in a way Jonah understands and she helps him in a way that most benefits his abilities. Sarah and Miles become acquaintances and speak small talk here and there when Miles picks Jonah up. Sarah just moved into town where she started to teach. She came from a big city, New York, to where she could have a fresh start in a new place. After her husband cheated and then divorced her it left her devastated, she packed her things and moved to the town to put that horrible time in her past. Her parents live here and she longed to be closer to them for the support and to have someone she could count on. After meeting Jonah\u2019s dad and talking here and there they began realizing their pasts both deal with the loss of a loved one and how they both need a fresh start. They start talking more and more and Jonah brings them closer and they eventually form a relationship with each other. A few things I enjoyed about this book was the fact that the author makes positive outcomes out of a negative past, and how the reader can see that anything can happen. Also, I enjoyed how Miles and Sarah share a common interest in Jonah and how a little boy with so many difficulties can brighten both their days in an instant and brings them closer without even knowing it. Another thing about this book I enjoyed was the overall closeness and warming feel the town brought to the book, they were a support system for both Miles and Sarah and that was special. On the other hand, one thing I didn't like as much was the jealousy Miles first felt from Sarah, which at first drew them apart. The jealously first started with how they both deal with Jonah in different ways and Jonah felt closer with Sarah and always wanted to be with her. I would recommend this book to any reader that likes reading about positive things that come out of tragic pasts, or any reader that is in need of a happy ending with a new family in the outcome. Readers that enjoy some romance and hard love also should read A Bend in the Road. ...more This book was AMAZING.I can't tell you how much I love Nicholas Sparks and his book. They are just beautiful and I'm really excited about reading so much more by him wow! i just can't get enough of the love stories Nicholas Sparks beautifully writes, he really does tug at the heart strings. i love this book, it is definately something i would recomend! at first when it was talking about Miles' wife, i was sad already knowing she later died leave him and Johan to live their lives alone and in pain. i don't like think about people upset even if it is only a book, but then came along sarah, oh the wonderfull sarah! they both deserved each other, hell they more t wow! i just can't get enough of the love stories Nicholas Sparks beautifully writes, he really does tug at the heart strings. i love this book, it is definately something i would recomend! at first when it was talking about Miles' wife, i was sad already knowing she later died leave him and Johan to live their lives alone and in pain. i don't like think about people upset even if it is only a book, but then came along sarah, oh the wonderfull sarah! they both deserved each other, hell they more than needed happiness in there life. i was so happy when i knew sarah came alone not replacing but providing much needed love to the family. i need to stop telling you about the story because you've probably it, silly me. so anyway, nichlos sparks really did make the story a mistory for most of the time, i mean i couldn't stop turning the pages untill i knew i knew who killed missy. but anyway i this this well deserves the 5 stars, it had me in tears yet again like all his stories and especially with the ending.. two candles in the window, true love really does exsist. thankyou once again Nicholas, and don't stop writing those incredible tales that make my heart sink. ...more Excellent and intriguing introduction I want to read more. Saras husband Micheal was in love with her, but no children is a deal breaker. He wanted a perfect life, and he wasn't going to have that with her. It sounds horrible, but they wouldn't have been happy. Miles seems like a good man. He apparently loved and missed his wife. He's trying so hard to keep going and take care of Jonah. I'm just waiting for Otis to do something. I like the simple deal Sarah makes with Miles about helping Jonah. The f Excellent and intriguing introduction I want to read more.

It's cute how Nicholas wrote each perspective of the budding romance. They are equally shy. I appreciate how the author used the title in the book about where Missy got it. Clever. I feel sorry for whoever hit Missy. It was an accident, but they should have confessed right away. I eas heartbreaking to lead when Sarah tells why Micheal left. That took a lot out of her. When they say I love You, it's too cute I did not expect the hit and run driver to be Brian Miles is such aa good man and father the deal he makes with Brian is beyond a good guy. ...more Justi\u00e7a.

I loved this story so much because it was written first of all by my favorite author Nicholas Sparks. Second, it is based on a true story that happened to either a family member or a close friend to Nicholas. Third, all his stories are based in North Carolina, which in my opinion shows how much he truly loves his hometown. Finally, the language was really easy to understand, and by the end of every chapter you're very curious to want to know what would happen next. ...more Finally!!
