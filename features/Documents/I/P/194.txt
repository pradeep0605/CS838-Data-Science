But, <+++>Life Expectancy</+++> is a REALLY CLOSE second favorite book by Dean Koontz. It's one of the best books that I ever read. NOT HORROR My second favorite Koontz' novel!!! A TRUE FAVORITE I love this book!!! This novel isn't featured in my virtual shelf of \"Favorites\", but not because I don't like it, just since I already have Phantoms in that shelf and I want to keep it to maximum 10 books there, it would have to be 2 books from Dean Koontz and if I have to make the hard choice, I'd choose Phantoms . But, <+++>Life Expectancy</+++> is a REALLY CLOSE second favorite book by Dean Koontz. It's one of the best books that I ever read. NOT HORROR PER SE BUT STILL SUPERB It has all, horror, humor, romance, etc... Even it's not your typical horror book, since not matter you have an insane killer here, you don't feel it as in other horror books. If you like the type of books of Stephen King where he develops seudo-paranormal stories with content about life and human relationships, not exactly looking to present a horror story but a complex tale with some horror-like elements on it. I think you can have a pretty good idea of what you will find here. SOOO GOOD!!! Two of the highest points of the books are: First: The humor. You will laugh a lot with this book, because even some situations of life or death are portraited in such surrealistic way that you have to laugh (<---B>in a good way</---B>) about how the events are ocurring.<---F> Second: The female supportive character</---F>. She is one that the lead character met. She is fantastic! It's one of the best female characters that I ever read in book. I just love her. I won't elaborate more since I don't want to spoil about her. I just want to say that she is the light who shines plenty, since she becomes part of the story. ...more Life Expectancy is a pretty fun read. It was so different than most books I've read in the genre, and was much different than I expected. It flows so perfectly from the first person point of view, and the characters are unforgettable. Plus, it has clowns... It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you question all good looking men. LIFE EXPECTANCY Review I'm about to spoil the hell out of this piece of garbage in the hopes that you run screaming from its pages as if the longevity of your genitals depended on it. The Good: This book is readable. Meaning, you can read it. Moving on. The Bad: The synopsis is terrific: engaging, intriguing, enticing, everything a book description should be. So why isn't this up there with The Good? Because the synopsis fucking lies like a rug under a steam roller.

The Good: This book is readable. Meaning, you can read it. Moving on. The Bad: The synopsis is terrific: engaging, intriguing, enticing, everything a book description should be. So why isn't this up there with The Good? Because the synopsis fucking lies like a rug under a steam roller. You see, Jimmy Tock's grandpappy predicted some shit on his deathbed. Supposedly, his grandson is to have five terribly, horrible, no good, very bad days. The thing is, Koontz spends the entire novel finding ways around these five days, in turn rendering the grandfather's predictions utterly useless. Bad shit happens, mind you, just not on those days. The worst stuff happens on the day before. You might think that would make the book unpredictable, but after the first date, the book is as see through as the glass in a Windex factory. What would have made this book epic is if Koontz had managed to actually achieve what the packaging promises, therein surprising us with unforeseeable twists which occur on the days Deathbed Granddaddy predicted. But no. Not Koontz. He aims for the mundane and nails that motherfucker between the eyes. The Ugly: LIFE EXPECTANCY is filled with your average meandering Koontz: verbose descriptions of everyday bullshit sprinkled with brief glimpses of interesting detritus buried under an insane knowledge of pastry and off-the-wall diseases he spends nine pages explaining. The writing is so light and dense at the same time it might as well be a Cronut. The words breeze by because Koontz has been doing this shit for nigh on four decades, but no matter how hard he tries, I will never, ever, evereverevereverever, enjoy a detailed examination of goddamn baked goods. The Unforgivable: Let me preface this bit by saying I've never given a readable book less than two stars. Why? Because the author put enough words together properly so that I might be able to understand what they are saying. I reserve one-star ratings for unedited garbage written by illiterate monkeys with a penchant for banging on typewriters. Well, Dean, you fucking did it, mister. You managed to make me hate a well-written book so much that I cannot in good faith give you anything over a single, solitary, emotionally-crippled star. This book lacks everything even remotely resembling character development. I didn't give a shit about Jimmy, his wife What's-Her-Fuck, the three mostly-forgotten-about children (one of which comes down with cancer in the later part of the book, to which I responded, \"Who are you, and who gives a fuck?\"), the stupid clown family, the insane aerialists, or even the death of some innocent old lady, because they're all stick figures caricatures of another one of Koontz protagonists from a completely different book. Yes, everyone in this novel is witty and sarcastic. Basically, the cast is overrun with unlikable and forgettable Odd Thomases. But wait, there's more! The plot, for lack of a better word, becomes so convoluted in the last one hundred pages that I think my brain seeped from my ear to vacation in Aruba when Jimmy Tock (the main character) is revealed as the villain's fraternal twin brother. But wait, there's even more! When that ending didn't pack enough of a punch for Koontz's liking, we find out that Jimmy and the villain are really the product of an incestuous relationship between their biological grandfather/father and his daughter/their mother. And if you place an order in the next thirty seconds, we'll throw in lots more! Four chapters from the end, Jimmy's first-person POV switches to the wife's first-person POV so that Koontz can attempt to trick us into believing that Jimmy dies. But Jimmy doesn't die. What a hoot, huh? A real rib-tickler of a twist! To quote the book: \"Okay, we yanked your chain again, like we did back in chapter twenty-four. How much fun would it have been, there in the big top, if you'd been absolutely certain that I had survived?\" Are you joshing me? Pulling E.'s leg, perhaps? Legitimately, you're going to break the fourth wall to say that shit? I should punch you in your cocksucker with a hot-water bottle full of nitroglycerin. It wasn't funny. It sure as shit wasn't cute. It was pretentious. Pure, lazy-ass, unoriginal, amateur bullshit. You, your editor, your publisher, and anyone who recommends this book to a human being who isn't their most reviled enemy should have to read this book over and over and over again, forever and ever, amen. ...more \"Some lives, conducted with grace, are beautiful arcs bridging this world to eternity.\" \"No one's life should be rooted in fear. We are born for wonder, for joy, for hope, for love, to marvel at the mystery of existence, to be ravished by the beauty of the world, to seek truth and meaning, to acquire wisdom, and by our treatment of others to brighten the corner where we are.\" \"No one can grant you happiness.

Happiness is a choice we all have the power to make.\" Ever since first reading this book 2005, I have considered it my very favorite Dean Koontz novel. After reading it for the fourth time, this masterpiece retains it's rank of my #1 favorite :-) I will admit it has some fierce competition with \"By the Light of the Moon\", \"Relentless\" and \"Cold Fire\", but it stands as a shining star of my favorites for it's superb mix of simplicity, humor, suspense and twists. It's lessons on life and family are wonderful - the clowns and aerialists are entertaining :-) and we mustn't forget Grandma Roweena (my favorite character in the story) PREPARE TO BE ENCHANTED!!!!!! ...more This is what I wrote reading this book........ This is the second time I am trying to read this book. I am a huge Koontz fan but this book really disappointed me. It is so far, not exiting or scary at all, because the main characters are not frightened. They are constantly making funny (not) remarks and it is just not realistic. You are a hostage and you are constantly cracking jokes!!! No way. I have read 170 pages of the book and am really struggling (again!) to read more.

It was hard to identify with. BUT, because the author is such a talented writer, there were many parts I enjoyed. I laughed or chuckled several times - especially at Lorrie\u2019s comments. If you\u2019re new to this author, don\u2019t start with this book. See below for my favorites. The narrator John Bedford Lloyd was great. I was pleased that he used a soft, feminine voice for Lorrie without sounding like an effeminate gay guy. (view spoiler) [ There was one illogical and stupid part. On one of the disaster days, a box is delivered to Jimmy at his home. He hopes it is not a bomb. So why does he open the box in the presence of his loved ones? He should have had the police bomb squad x-ray it and do it for him. (hide spoiler) ] DATA: Narrative mode: first person Jimmy and a little Lorrie.

Yes, there were clowns, and while this was weird and bizarre, I somehow sort of got what Koontz was trying to do. This book is eccentric because it combines the bizarro with the little sweet lessons about the good and honest things in life- love, family, and faith. I found myself rereading some of the poignant passages that Koontz would slip into this wacko story because they were so well written and so meaningful. I doubt many people will feel the same way about this book as I did, but to anyone who reads it, I recommend that you lighten up and not take things too seriously when you read it. There are unexpected surprises and alot of humor. This is always a good mix. ...more This book was a strange book. I don't know how else to describe it.

LOL Though it contained plenty of suspense, it was also a love story in a sense, not a romance, but so many parts of the book, and particularly the end, gave me the warm fuzzies--the kind that bring tears to your eyes.

It's filled with a cast of varied and realistic characters, the struggle between good and evil, and the message that there is always a reason to hope. Koontz has a beautiful style that has me laughing out loud often, even when the characters are facing life and death situations. There is horror in the novel, just like there is in the world. And if there is horror then should there not also be humor? I adore the tale of Jimmy, Lorrie, Annie, Lucy, Andy, Rudy, Maddy, and Rowena. Such a great family. And the ending was perfect. ...more This is one of my favorite Dean Koontz novels. It has all of the elements you would expect to find in a DK novel! Dean Koontz never disappoints. So many unexpected twists and turns. Gripping and imaginative story that reminded me why I used to read his books every chance I got. If there is any Koontz novel I wish I'd written myself, it's \"Life Expectancy\u201d. This book hits all the right chords: the absurdity of life, the interconnectedness of human beings, recognizable characters, signature humor, all put together with the reality of sudden violence.

This book hits all the right chords: the absurdity of life, the interconnectedness of human beings, recognizable characters, signature humor, all put together with the reality of sudden violence. Minutes before Jimmy Tock was born, his dying grandfather made several predictions not only about his birth, but also gave warnings of five terrible days to come in his future. Together with his family, Jimmy prepares himself for the inevitable. Told from Jimmy\u2019s own first person perspective \u2013 and partly from his wife\u2019s at the end of the novel, in a kind of cheesy \u201cgotcha there!\u201d attempt to add a rather fabricated final twist \u2013 the book wraps you in its arms of familiarity. This technique, previously applied to novels as \u201cTwilight Eyes\u201d, the Chris Snow books and the Odd Thomas series, is one of Koontz\u2019s greatest accomplishments as a writer. The only downside of it in this particular case, might be the load of bakery and pastry analogies Jimmy Tock often resorts to while describing something. Spending time at the Tock family dinner table is like a verbal rollercoaster ride \u2013 only backwards; you don\u2019t see the loops coming until you\u2019re suddenly upside down already. Grandma Rowena herself alone is worth her weight in gold. The first of the terrible days Jimmy has to face is excellent storytelling, moreso because it\u2019s the most incredible fashion in which the hero and heroine in a Koontz tale meet up. From the moment Lorrie Lynn Hicks walked through that library door, I shared Jimmy\u2019s sentiments and fell head over heels in love with her. Like Jimmy says, she\u2019s the type of girl you want your family to meet. She\u2019s so ad lib, imaginative, resourceful and brave, but also vulnerable, scared and insecure at the times she should be. While riddled with violent events, \u201cLife Expectancy\u201d is a story filled with humor, which displays itself mostly through the dialogues. These characters often go on wild tangents, make crazy out-of-place remarks, create misunderstandings, and all the while there\u2019s simply no telling whether they\u2019re serious about it or just pulling someone\u2019s leg. Some of the more action driven parts, like the off-road driving in a snowstorm, can become a little boring after a while, but only compared to the other scenes where heroes and villains trade wisecracks. The lack of witty dialogue is only natural in this case, but it creates the risk of the story getting a bit dumbed down to nothing but a cheap action tale. The later chapters trade in some of the humor for some heavy drama. When Lorrie gets shot and has to be rushed to the hospital, we feel with Jimmy and totally understand his sentiments when he says that \u201cwe don't fear our own deaths as much as the deaths of those we love\u201d. We remember from \u201cOdd Thomas\u201d that Koontz doesn\u2019t always necessarily write a happy ending for his characters \u2013 and at the ending of \u201cLife Expectancy\u201d we see that he even tries to copy his misleading about Stormy Llewellyn\u2019s death in a rather unsuccesful practical joke. The most devastating chapters, however, must be when the story\u2019s real twist is revealed, Jimmy turns out to be a Beezo biologically, and the villain is the only suitable donor for an ill child. Punchinello\u2019s attitude in the prison, the reaction of both Jimmy and Lorrie, and his sudden change of heart seem to be ripped out of some soap opera \u2013 not to mention the baby switching at birth \u2013 but it never comes over as an old clich\u00e9; it works and fits the rest of the book. This novel is actually unique in that it has so many villains, the better to illustrate the differences between good and evil. Not only are there father and son Beezo, but also grandpa Vivacemente who makes for a very formidable final nemesis. \u201cLife Expectancy\u201d is about man being confronted with his own mortality. Because you have no idea what the future holds in store for you, you\u2019d better enjoy life to the fullest, embrace your family and friends, choose the path that destiny lays out for you. Our lives aren\u2019t shaped solely by the environment in which we grow up, but also by our own personal decisions. ...more Simply put, this novel is nothing short of incredible. Highly original, darkly amusing and almost (ALMOST) too clever for it's own good. For me the mark of a good book is the inability to put it down. Getting so caught up in the story and the characters that you think abouto it even when you're not reading it.

I'll still be thinking about this book in the weeks to come, trying to work out what kind of 'lesson' (so to speak) I got from the story. While it's vastly importment for a story to be entertaining it also helps greatly when the reader can take something out from the book. When the reader is touched emotionally and learns just a miniscule fact concerning this crazy thing we call life, that's when we have something special. Off the top of my head I can cite hope as a theme. Hope in the face of tragedy and misery and still being brave enough to hope for the best. When Jimmy and Laurie are (view spoiler) [ discussing cynicisim versus pessicisim I think it's a bit of a turning point for the two of them. As they become a married couple I think they balance eachother out nicely, allowing them to survive the five horrible days which were prophecized with grace and dignity. To finish, there's also a line towards the end citing the opposite of hope is desperation. I feel that that fits quite nicely.

The premise of the story is a fun one: on the night of Jimmy Tock's birth, his dying grandfather predicts the time of Jimmy's birth, his weight, a physical ailment...and that Jimmy will suffer five terrible days in his life. Considerately, Jimmy's grandfather even offers the dates of these five terrible days. Koontz loves his quirky characters, and Jimmy - a baker in a small Colorado ski town - is no exception. He, his family, and the love of his life all share a healthy, if somewhat off-kilter sense of humor, and that sense of humor is displayed throughout the book, despite the threat of the Five Terrible Days that haunt Jimmy's life. I enjoyed Jimmy's family, although sometimes, their dialogue tries too hard for witty and it shows. The base premise of this one totally carries the story; I really wanted to know what each of the five days would bring. It's a classic Koontz story of Love/Good v. Madness/Evil, with just enough of a supernatural underpinning to keep it from being an overly morbid, could have been ripped from the headlines kind of read. Plot twists abound in the last third of the book, but thankfully, they all feel pretty organic.

There was a unique banter amongst his family that I both recognized my own family in, and also wanted to be even more like. The story itself was engaging - I'm not sure how I'd really classify it, it had elements of drama, mystery, suspense, humor, and even romance (not gross fake romance, but real, sarcastic, honest, loving, inspiring romance). The book subtly reflects on themes such as living your life to the fullest despite not knowing what the future holds, what makes \"family\", good vs. evil, the meaning of life.... all wrapped up in a story with bakers, evil clowns, crazy people, car chases and twists and turns that caught me off guard throughout. This was a fast read, both because it's so well written, and also because I was so dying to know how it happened that I picked it and didn't put it down until I got through it!. Inspiring, entertaining, well written - I highly recommend to anyone! :) ...more I tend to avoid authors with huge shelves of published work (Danielle Steele, Piers Anthony, etc.) because I tried and found them incredibly unreadable.

The twist at the end seemed rushed, like DK was tired of writing and wanted to wrap up in a hurry. Not that it was too much of a surprise. My biggest and most petty complaint is that he uses Dan Brown paragraphs, i.e., nearly every sentence. Do they think the reader doesn't have the attention span to keep up with a single thought through multiple sentences. I find that insulting. Insulting! I guess it's a trick to make your book seem longer. I used to do that in elementary school, where I got to the end of that 2 page essay by writing large/using 12.5 or 13pt font (don't want to be too obvious by using 14pt).

The second day on the list was the same. The book really starts on the third of Jimmy's horrible days and the events that result. Jimmy is such a normal, lovable character, that you'll find yourself rooting for him more than most others. He's a normal baker; a good, honest man who works hard and always tries to do what's right. He has a wonderful family who raised him well and later a family of his own that he raises the same way. But there are three more horrible days to get through.....after the first two, you start to wonder if he can survive them. ...more Mega langweilig und der Humor in diesem Buch (ich liebe Sarkasmus und schwarzen Humor) will einfach nicht z\u00fcnden. Ich habe kein einziges Mal gelacht (nach 250 Seiten!), obwohl Koontz durchaus dies beim Leser bezwecken wollte. Nun gut... frustriert abgebrochen. I am going to use my review of Dean Koontz's Life Expectancy to discuss a matter that seems of great importance in most of Koontz's work, mental illness. Koontz often simplifies his antagonists' motivations to the basic idea, \"This person is insane.\" \"Why is that?\" you may ask. Well, I'll tell you. It's because labeling a character as insane means that Koontz can throw logic and rationality right out the window. Why does this person kill entire families, collecting trophies of his murders? Becau I am going to use my review of Dean Koontz's Life Expectancy to discuss a matter that seems of great importance in most of Koontz's work, mental illness. Koontz often simplifies his antagonists' motivations to the basic idea, \"This person is insane.\" \"Why is that?\" you may ask. Well, I'll tell you. It's because labeling a character as insane means that Koontz can throw logic and rationality right out the window. Why does this person kill entire families, collecting trophies of his murders? Because this person is insane. Why does that person stalk and secretly harass a random individual, nailing his hand to the floor and framing him for a murder? Because that person is insane. It's an easy (and lazy) fallback that Koontz relies on again and again to propel his plots forward. More baffling than his dedication to making everyone on the wrong side of law and order insane, is Koontz's strange belief that insane people all share a single inherent quality beyond simply doing crazy shit to throw everything around them into chaos: they all believe that eating something gives you its power. Cue the braking and stunned silence. \"What is that?\" you say, \"Do you have evidence about this?\" Oh, follow along, dear reader. Example 1: In Dean Koontz's Intensity , the crazed killer, Edgar Vess, takes a moment from his swift and silent murder spree through the Templeton household to casually consume a small spider. We are then granted a brief insight into the killer's brain as he feels the spider's power flow through him. Example 2: In Dean Koontz's Forever Odd , the prime antagonist, Datura, the evil phone sex operator (where does he come up with this shit?), plans to cut out and consume Odd's heart so as to gain his ability to see the dead. Example 3: Life Expectancy , which you are here to read about and I will now briefly discuss, has a scene where Punchinello Beezo, the insane clown (see comment about evil phone sex operator above) stops to eat a spider. Now, if you've read the book, you will say, \"Aha! But there's nothing in the book that says that Punchinello thinks he's gaining the spider's power!\" Yes, that's true. But given Koontz's track record for crazy people eating things and thinking they've gained the power of it, I think it's safe to say that Punchinello believed he had spider essence running through his veins just before he lost his ability to have kids. Now, I've not read all of Koontz's work, and there are a few stories of his that I've read where the crazy person does NOT eat anything living. But then, in most cases, the antagonist's actions and thoughts are usually kept hidden, so for all we know, they were busy gobbling up a bowl of Spider-O's before making their way to the mall to shoot up everybody in sight. Anyway, with that off my chest, Life Expectancy is Dean Koontz's means to argue the case of nurture over nature using precognition, a mentally unstable circus troupe, a family of bakers, one unfortunate spider and a series of seemingly implausible and head-scratchingly stupid events. It is an argument he ultimately fails simply because it ignores any sort of reasoning or explanation in favor of \"these people are all two screws short of a two screw bucket\". I personally think it works better as another example of Dean Koontz's deep, deep hatred for the rest of humanity. ...more LOVED this book!

Rather than describe the plot-line in detail, I will be highlighting key areas of the book that particularly drew my attention as a writer. Please note that there will be spoilers. A brief blurb of the book goes something like this; Jimmy Tock is born on the same night (in the same hospital) that his Grandfather dies. In his dying words (over a thunder and lightning storm) the Grandfather leaves his own son (Jimmy's Father) five bad predictions that will occur on particular dates in Jimmy's life. When we read the blurb on the back of the book, we are told that there will be five predictions, but not what they are. This is a perfect example of 'the power of a hook in a blurb'. When we discover that there are five predictions but not what they are, our curiosity is sparked and we are held in a grip wanting to know more. The main reason for a hook is to raise questions inside a readers mind (the what, where, why) and to push them on to read further. The blurb's hook leaves us asking several questions that we want answers to, for instance; What are the five predictions? Where do these predictions occur? Why does it happen, and why does it happen to Jimmy Tock? And ultimately, will Jimmy survive these five terrible predictions? The book is written in first person, from the viewpoint of Jimmy Tock. The first person tense has an immediate connection with the reader; enabling us to step into the protagonist's shoes and experience their world through the five senses. I personally loved the 'voice' of Jimmy - a guy who has a slight complex about his physical appearance (and talks about it to us) yet is strong-minded - in general. I have often read that a main character (hero or villain) should be capable of dealing with all of the obstacles that you place in his path - that they should be able to fight all conflicts to the bitter end - even if in the end they win or lose. I have also read that a main character should not be completely perfect and that they should have at least one flaw - one that he has to face and fight on a more personal level. If we analyse the profile of Jimmy Tock, we get a real-life, everyday guy with an unusual, personal flaw (I won't give the flaw away!). He is capable of battling out his conflicts both internally and externally, and he changes and gets strongers as the book progresses (perfect!). Of course, although he ultimately gets stronger, we do have to see his efforts waver along the plot line in order to keep the reader tense - and guessing. It is essential that we see him fall and rise at his own efforts - and that he used all he had to reach the end. I also think that Jimmy 'shined' as a character because of his impeccable sense of humour. When I look more closely at the entire chemistry of the book, I see a strong fusion of horror and humour. This dark/light is a fantastic combination because it ensures that we are not trodden down in darkness and depression for pages on end. The humour brings us to laugh (even in the darkness moments) with the characters. It is often said that it is a crime for the author to 'step into a narrative with his own opinions', and I agree. But should an author want to air an opinion in their novel (politics, religion, law etc) then they can learn a lot from Dean Koontz and his method. I am not saying that all of the views in his books are ones that he believes and airs, but as a reader I have analysed that it often seems to be the case in places. I think that this can be a good thing when done correctly because it adds a personal touch without spelling it out. So how does Dean do this? Well his views get injected through his characters and their dialogue. The dialogue of one character may contain an author's personal view of something happening in the world - or it may contain a humorous line that the author has always told in his own life. This is where we get into the territory of 'how real or fictional are your characters?' I believe that most authors, when sketching out characters, will use a mixture of both real and imagined personalities in order to create new and unique characters. I have often wondered how much of the author is in a character - in the many of the characters I have come to meet in books. In the case of Jimmy Tock, I believe that he contains a lot of Dean Koontz's sense of humour - which I must say is impeccable! I am not sure if any of you have heard of the quote 'all you need for a movie is a gun and a girl' by Jean Luc-Godard (a French Film Director) but I believe this quote rings true for almost any film and any horror/thriller book. It certainly rings true for this book, where there are numerous guns and gunshots - which also occur around an attractive female character, that later becomes the wife of Jimmy Tock. I suppose what the gun and girl quote is really saying to us is that a story isn't a story without a gun (symbol for conflict) and a girl (symbol of romance) as such. That without conflict we have no story, that without love we are missing a key part of our souls - that together they fuse a Universal idea. Both these elements combine love, excitement, danger and romance - and what is more exciting than that? Nothing. Knowing that this book contains what I consider to be two essential themes in fiction, tells me that Dean is a master of his craft - that he has studied and mastered the mechanics of writing and his specific genres. This allows him to go that extra mile with his trade-mark sense of humour. Lastly, even though this book was made up of many pages, the tightness and suspense of plot, the interesting characters, and those five predictions made me read on to the end! I am usually a medium-paced reader, but with this book I was flying through! That's a good sign. I recommend this book to readers who love a fast-paced suspense thriller/horror - and those who like a dry and wicked sense of humour mixed in. When I read the last page I was sad that I would never live with these characters again - that their journey's had ended. If a writer can inject a character or two into a reader for life then they have done their job well. That's why we remember and love the classics - it's all about the characters. I still find myself repeating some of Dean's creative character names from this book, just because they sound so good on the tongue!...Punchinello, Konrad Beezo...
