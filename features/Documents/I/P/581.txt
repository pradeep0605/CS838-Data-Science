Undoubtedly the absolute high of Pratchett's writing. This is the book that does not seem likely to lose its relevance in the world like ours, where, sadly, we see the thriving of the hatred and prejudice and insistence on fixating on what separates us from each other fueled by the waves of bigoted populism. Maybe it will get better one day. ---------------- \"What kind of creature defines itself by hatred?\" That is the overarching theme of <---A>Terry Pratchett</---A>'s <+++>Thud!</+++> which is indisputably one of his best works - in content and execution and the amount of serious thinking it makes me do after seeing the usual 'mundane' things through the prism of Pratchett's writing. Like other Pratchett's later works, this book is a departure from the light-hearted humorous comedic tone of earlier Discworld books which initially were just smart and witty parodies of fantasy genre conventions but have easily transcended that since. Yes,<---M> the witty remarks</---M>, dry humor and the moments of pure comedic genius are still unquestionably there, but the overall tone has changed.<---F> It's more serious</---F>. It gets angry. It has sharp edges. It's not afraid to bite. It wants to make you think - and maybe chuckle once in a while during it. The comedy this time has met the tragedy. And no wonder, for the material it tackles is not light-hearted at all. If I had just one word to sum it up the theme it would be Darkness. - Of course, the darkness of underground mines and caverns - the obvious one. - The horrible darkness of bigotry and hatred and prejudice and ethnic conflicts. - The intolerant darkness of any sort of fundamentalism. - The oppressive darkness of political intrigues that plow right over the lives of ordinary persons. - The seductive darkness of mindless revenge. - And, of course, the hidden darkness that lurks inside each person. Even inside Sam Vimes. Especially Sam Vimes. \"No excuses. No excuses at all. Once you had a good excuse, you opened the door to bad excuses.\" Commander of Ankh Morpork City Watch (and also the Duke of Ankh and former Blackboard Monitor), Sam Vimes is a straight-as-an-arrow copper who may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer ( so they say, but *they* may not always be right ) but who is your go-to man when manure hits the windmill . After all, \"When people are trying to kill you, it means you\u2019re doing something right. It was a rule Sam had lived by.\" He has been through a lot since his days as a cynical disillusioned drunk in the once-dysfunctional Ankh-Morpork Watch. As time went by, he gained a lot - a city that miraculously functions and manages to remain stable, loyal colleagues who became dear friends, and family that provides him the blessing he is afraid he does not deserve. But all things gained can be lost, and that's something that would worry him quite a bit. \"Vimes had never got on with any game much more complex than darts. Chess in particular had always annoyed him. It was the dumb way the pawns went off and slaughtered their fellow pawns while the kings lounged about doing nothing that always got to him; if only the pawns united, maybe talked the rooks round, the whole board could've been a republic in a dozen moves.\" And this time Sam Vimes has enough to worry about. Ankh-Morpork is not a good place to be right now, with tensions from the centuries-old ethnic conflicts (in Discworld fashion, those are between the dwarfs and the trolls) at the all-time high as the anniversary of Koom Valley is nearing. Koom Valley was a place where centuries ago the dwarfs ambushed the trolls. Or perhaps the trolls ambushed the dwarfs. Nobody knows. What they do know is that they are supposed to hate each other - because it's always been so. For them, the battle of Koom Valley never ended, and Sam Vimes would do anything to prevent it from replaying in the streets of Ankh-Morpork. The no-idea-who-ambushed-whom Battle of Koom Valley seemed like a throwaway joke in the earlier Discworld books. But here Pratchett takes full advantage of it, turning the funny on its head, making it serious and even tragic at times. Because Koom Valley still lives on in the minds of people despite hundreds of miles and hundreds of years, and still claims its victims as the dead bodies pile up and hatred is sparked by those who think they see the light (or rather, the darkness), and riots are about to tear the city apart and turn it into another battle of Koom Valley, and Sam Vimes is not having it, and not even ancient supernatural entities can stop him. \u2018Given, then, a contest between an invisible and very powerful quasi-demonic thing of pure vengeance on the one hand, and the commander on the other, where would you wager, say\u2026one dollar?\u2019 \u2018I wouldn\u2019t, sir. That looks like one that would go to the judges.\u2019 Pratchett's Ankh-Morpork world by the time of <+++>Thud!</+++> has become incredibly complex and developed - to the point where the portrait of the city in my mind is as vivid as though I have really lived there. The characters are unbelievably alive, complex, multilayered, evolving, developing, growing, and very real (yes, real - despite this being a fantasy world, it's firmly grounded in sometimes whacky reality). Pratchett excels at so seamlessly combining the comedy and suspense and drama and tragedy (often within a single page) that the effect is mesmerizing and undeniably incredibly memorable. \u201cThe important thing is not to shout at this point, Vimes told himself. Do not\u2026what do they call it\u2026go postal? Treat this as a learning exercise. Find out why the world is not as you thought it was. Assemble the facts, digest the information, consider the implications. THEN go postal. But with precision.\u201d The little details - from the father's unerring love for his child (view spoiler) [(Vimes' semi-delirious rendition of 'Where's My Cow?' amidst the destruction in the caves under Koom Valley and his chilling moment of realization that the assassin would easily target his small child) (hide spoiler) ] , to Detritus' war on drugs and troll graffiti (\u201cMr. Shine! Him Diamond!\u201d) , to the desperation of a gamer dwarf who is so good playing as a troll in the chess-like game of Thud and who cannot quite reconcile what he is with what he is expected to be, to the little pedantic office clerk with the heart of a lion, to the guilt that can literally kill, to silly discussions about what constitutes art, to Vimes' careful and never ending battle to keep the darkness in despite everything around him that so easily could be fixed by just one flash of mindless rage - all these details combine so beautifully into a fascinating and vivid picture that tells a story so good it's a real (un)expected treasure. A treasure just like a certain painting by an unfortunate artist whose life can be summed up as such - \"Methodia Rascal: born, painted famous picture, thought he was a chicken, died.\" A treasure because, if nothing else, it makes me think once more about the need for guarding the darkness like a true Blackboard Monitor Watchman. 'Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Your grace.' 'I know that one,' said Vimes. 'Who watches the watchmen? Me, Mr. Pessimal.' 'Ah, but who watches you, your grace?' said the inspector, with a brief smile. 'I do that, too. All the time,' said Vimes. 'Believe me.' Terry Pratchett is an amazing writer, an excellent storyteller. The craft of writing in his hands is precisely that - not a nebulous semi-magical art (after all, it's got no urns in it, just ask Fred Colon and <---C>Nobby</---C>!) but a true well-honed masterful craft. And that in my opinion is the sheer awesome greatness. And I love it. And I will continue finding reasons to quote Pratchett on daily basis. Because he's that good. \u201cI am the Summoning Dark.\u201d It was not, in fact, a sound, but had it been, it would have been a hiss. \u201cWho are you?\u201d \u201cI am the Watchman.\u201d \u201cThey would have killed his family!\u201d The darkness lunged, and met resistance. \u201cThink of the deaths they have caused! Who are you to stop me?\u201d \u201cHe created me. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Who watches the watchmen? Me. I watch him. Always. You will not force him to murder for you.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of human creates his own policeman?\u201d \u201cOne who fears the dark.\u201d \u201cAnd so he should,\u201d said the entity, with satisfaction. \u201cIndeed. But I think you misunderstand. I am not here to keep the darkness out. I am here to keep it in.\u201d There was a clink of metal as the shadowy watchman lifted a dark lantern and opened its little door. Orange light cut through the blackness. \u201cCall me\u2026 the Guarding Dark. Imagine how strong I must be.\u201d The Summoning Dark backed desperately into the alley, but the light followed it, burning it. \u201cAnd now,\u201d said the watchman, \u201cget out of town.\u201d [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more The war between the dwarfs and the trolls was a battle of natural forces, like the war between the wind and the waves. It had a momentum of its own. It's origins are hidden in the mists surrounding the mythical Koom Valley, a place where each side is accusing the other of treacherous ambush, but its recent manifestation has moved to Ankh-Morpork, courtesy of the city's new policies of welcoming immigrants.

They undermine The war between the dwarfs and the trolls was a battle of natural forces, like the war between the wind and the waves. It had a momentum of its own. It's origins are hidden in the mists surrounding the mythical Koom Valley, a place where each side is accusing the other of treacherous ambush, but its recent manifestation has moved to Ankh-Morpork, courtesy of the city's new policies of welcoming immigrants. Pretty soon some people will be saying: Who let all these dwarfs in here? They undermine our city and they don't obey our laws. And the trolls? We used to chain 'em up like guard dogs, and now they're allowed to walk around threatening real people. Recent events (Dallas Police killings 2016, Brexit) make this Discworld book published in 2005 almost prescient. Ankh-Morpork is a city about to explode into racial violence after the murder of a dwarf fundamentalist leader by an alleged troll intruder. All of this taking place on the eve of the Battle of Koom Valley anniversary. Young dwarfs listened to him, because he talked of history and destiny and all the other words that always got trotted out to put a gloss on slaughter. It was heady stuff, except that brains weren't involved. Malign idiots like him were the reason you saw dwarfs walking around now not just with the 'cultural' battle-axes but heavy mail, chains, morning stars, broadswords ... all the dumb, in-your-face swaggering that was known as 'clang'. Trolls listened, too. You saw more lichen, more clan graffiti, more body carving, and much, much bigger clubs being dragged around. Malign idiots (Trump?) are pushing the street gangs of trolls and dwarfs towards open violence but Ankh-Morpork has something that we in the real world are sorely missing: a real hero, a man of principle and integrity, a man of common sense and common decency who would not stand back and allow his city to crumble into dust around him, a man even the leaders of the crime underwold in Ankh-Morpork are turning to when the going gets rough. Here is Chrysophrase the troll drug dealer in a scene reminiscent of The Godfather: An' den I hear my ol' friend Mister Vimes is on der case and I am thinkin', dat Mister Vimes, he may be very insensitive to de nu-unces of troll culture sometimes, but der man is straight as a arrow and der are on him no flies. [...] But der name Vimes ... dat name means a lot. Can't be bribed, he once arrested the Patrician, not der sharpest knife in the drawer but honest like anything and he don't stop digging. Sam Vimes is rapidly becoming my favorite character in the whole Discworld series and I would vote for him for President in an eye-blink. Sam wouldn't want the job though. He belongs to the City Watch, has dedicated his life to Law and Order and he believes politics stinks. Politics, courtesy of the Lord Vetinary, is saddling Vimes with a new positive-action recruit representing a hated minority and with an internal audit of the Watch expense accounts. To complicate matters even more, Sam Vimes has to comply with Lady Sybill's request that he sits to have his portrait painted and has to learn to deal with new technology in the form of his Dis-Organizer Mark Five, the Gooseberry TM. . It makes for a busy daily schedule that somehow has to leave a window for the most important thing of all: Sam's six o'clock sharp meeting with his son: Young Sam was standing up in his cot, watching the door. Vimes's day went soft and pink. Thud is at its most basic a crime story, with Sam Vimes cast in a Sam Spade type of role and the theme of ethnic war fueled by xenophobia and demagoguery make it a bone-chilling experience. Sir Terry Pratchett though manages to find the humorous side of even the darkest corners of our social conscience, and old characters mix with the new recruits to produce yet another memorable Discworld journey. Everyone starts on the street. And on the Night Watch, too. Good training. The best there is. A week of rainy nights with the mists coming up and the water trickling down your neck and odd noises in the shadows ... well, that's when we find out if we've got a real copper. Salacia Deloresista Amanita Trigestatra Zeldana Malifee ... von Humpeding is one of these new recruits. She's a vampire, and a girl, and the traditional racial enemy of werewolves, but Vimes must include her in his team. Sally, as she likes to be known, will ultimately prove to be a valuable member of the City Watch, especially after she makes a guarded pact with her shapechanging Sergeant Angua and with Cheery, the bearded dwarf lady at the Watch reception desk. Their girls' night out in the company of Tawneee, the six foot exotic dancer from the \"Girls, Giggles and Garters\" night club (the new flame of Corporal Nobby), is as wild as you can expect from this interracial mix: \"We've struck a blow for womanhood, Sally declared loudly. Shoes, men, coffins ... never accept the first one you see.\" Similar hidden depths are revealed also by Mr. Pessimal, the mousy auditor nitpicking the receipts of Guard expenses, and by Willikins, the butler at Lady Sybill and Sam's mansion, a useful man to have around if (view spoiler) [ you are at the receiving end of a dwarf terrorist cell attack. (hide spoiler) ] The clues of the case vary from the gruesome and heartbreaking discovery of new bodies in the illicit mining works the dwarfs are digging under Ankh-Morpork to the quirky references to new-age mumbo-jumbo: - Do you believe in the healing power of crystals, young man? snapped the woman, raising the club threateningly. [...] You're not a rock hound yourself, Commander? - I've had the occasional stone thrown at me, said Vimes. I've never bothered to check what kind it was. Some of the old charm of early Discworld novels can be still found in this more thoughtful and sharp satire in brief sparkles of irreverent fun: - I'm in deep copro, right? he said. - Certainly we need to talk to you, said Carrot. Do you want a lawyer? - No, I ate already. >><<>><<>><< No one read the reports. They appear to be what we in the trade call write-only documents. >><<>><<>><< The major tonality of the story remains though one that should give us pause and make us reflect on where do we position ourselves on the issues of the day: What kind of creature defines itself by hatred? What kind of human creates his own policeman? One who fears the dark. Sam Vimes does his duty not because he gets paid, or because he has sworn some oath or because he is an Ankh-Morpork patriot. He does it because he has to live with himself when he looks in the mirror in the morning while shaving. He does it because he knows there is a darkness inside each of us that must not be allowed to get out and roam free. Beating people up in little rooms ... he knew where that led. And if you did it for a good reason, you'd do it for a bad one. You couldn't say \"we're the good guys\" and do bad-guy things. Sometimes the watching watch-man inside every good copper's head could use an extra pair of eyes. Sam Vimes is an inspiration and a role model to his Watch and to his wards in the city. In Discworld it is still possible to have a chance to turn back the tide of hatred. A dwarf and a troll join Vimes in the search for a solution to the old Koom Valley dillema. Grag (means prophet or shaman in the dwarf culture) Bashfullson rejects the old ways of intransigence: \"Some of us move on, sir. Some of us think that darkness isn't a depth, it's a state of mind.\" Mr Shine, the troll legendary diamond ancestor, says we must start with ourselves if we want change: \"And thus we wear down mountains. Water dripping on stone, dissolving and removing. Changing the shape of the world, one drop at a time. Water dripping on a stone, Commander. Water flowing underground, bubbling up in unexpected places.\" Between them they might redirect the violent streak of their people to a game of Thud , giving a new interpretation to the title of the novel: This is Thud, Mister Vimes, he said, as little stone figures bounced over the board. Dwarfs versus trolls. Eight trolls and thirty-two dwarfs, forever fighting their battles on a cardboard Koom Valley. I have tried to leave out the practical details of the investigation and the final outcome, focusing instead on the setting and on the main characters involved. I saved the best for last, the most important thing in life and the deciding factor in Sam Vimes' resolution of the case: This was the book of books, the greatest story ever told. Vimes didn't need to read it anymore. He knew it by heart. It was called \"Where's my Cow?\" The un-identified complainant has lost their cow. That was the story, really. ...more \"The fighting doesn't start until Koom Valley Day. That's tomorrow.\" \"Damn, I lost track. Will it affect us down here?\" Bashfullsson coughed politely. \"I don't think so, Commander. This area is too dangerous to fight in.\" \"Well, yes, I can see it would be terrible if anyone got hurt,\" said Vimes, climbing over a long heap of rotting timber. \"That would spoil the day for everyone.\" While the main mystery of this one - a dwarf is apparently murdered by a troll - didn't interest me much, there are plen \"The fighting doesn't start until Koom Valley Day.

I really enjoyed the heck out of Angua and Cheery's Girl's Night Out with a vampire and a stripper, and then there was the memorable road trip to Koom Valley. Even in Discworld, historical reenactments blow. ...more Samuel Vimes, to me, is the most fascinating character in the discworld series - to watch his growth from a disillusioned drunkard in Guards!

So, rather than talk about the overall plot of the novel which didn\u2019t impact me all that much after seeing similar avenues in the series already explored (i.e. a murder which means further implications between fractious communities) I thought I would mention two stand out moments/things I took from the book which closely relate to each other in a way. The first is a scene where Sam is defending his home from intruders but the fear that his wife and son are in the home at the same time as these intruders and may be in trouble led to some of the most edge of the seat moments I\u2019ve read. Not just in this series, in general. I doff my hat to an author who can put a scene like that in to a \u201ccomedy\u201d book and make it work so well. The other is the determination and stubbornness of Vimes spending time at 6pm every night to read to Young Sam, not wanting to let down his son for any reason whatsoever as it would then become something of an easier appointment to break in the future after the first time and later in the book when it becomes harder and harder to keep that promise. This is all from a man who is introduced in the first novel passing out in the street as a drunken alcoholic (can you be a sober alcoholic?). The way his character has developed over the last 7 books has been quite remarkable, quite a lot can be learnt from him and his actions/morals. Hopefully I\u2019ll be half the dad he is when the time comes!! These are fun reads but to call them just that does quite a disservice to them and the author. Pick them up and enjoy them for what they are if you wish, peel back a couple of layers for a funnier look at what\u2019s on offer, peel back even more layers to be truly in awe of a great talent at work with a satirical view on life, politics and the world in general.

A new member joins the Watch, at Lord Vetinari's insistence, and against the gut instincts of Vimes and Angua. Sally is a gorgeous young-looking vampire who doesn't drink human blood. She's a member of the temperance league, a black-ribboner. A good chunk of the story dwells on Angua's insecurity around the svelte, sophisticated vampire (too much focus on that). We also meet the mysterious Mr. Shine and Inspector A.E. Pessimal, as well as Nobby's girlfriend, Tawneee (too much about her). Of course, it wouldn't be Discworld without another murder mystery to solve and a wild adventure (this time with warring trolls and dwarfs in the city and far away in Koom Valley) and enough pithy puns and cynical satire to sink a ship. (Actually, not as many witticisms as seen in prior books, but still enough for me.) Plot: (view spoiler) [ Some dwarves are digging under Ankh-Morpork, looking for an ancient cube. Some of these down-deep diggers are murdered in the city, and the priestly fundamentalist hooded dwarves (called grags) are blaming the trolls. The eerie sign of The Summoning Dark keeps appearing at murder sites. Intense racism, superstition, guilt and hostility runs high, and battle lines are forming up, right in the middle of Ankh-Morpork. Hostilities escalate right into Ramkin House on Scoone Avenue, where little Sam sleeps. This brings out the leashed beast in Commander Vimes (Good scene). Storytelling time is precisely 6:00. Not 6:15. Not 6:30. But what happens when it looks like Daddy just can't make it home from work on time? The whole City Watch makes damn sure he can, that's what. But what about when Daddy is trapped in the belly of the world, facing the Summoning Dark in the Valley of the Shadow of Death, aka Koom Valley? This is sacred land, where the battle between the trolls and dwarfs took place in ages past, with King of the Low Dwarfs, B'hrian Bloodaxe.

Far from home, fighting for his life, surrounded by smothering, summoning darkness, will Daddy find a way to read WHERE'S MY COW to young Sam on time?? Quibbles: Some of the relationships within the City Watch disappointed me a little. Some infighting, jealousy, etc. Sometimes, the tone gets a wee bit teachy / preachy, and some puns have me rolling my eyes, but still, jolly good stuff, complete with political satire and family values. Plot contrivance: I couldn't swallow that it took days for Vimes to hear the big news that Methodia Rascal's famous 50-foot painting of the Battle of Koom Valley was stolen. (It happened days ago and would have been in the newspaper and the Watch House gossip.) But this allowed the cool scene when Vimes thumped the table in anger, scattering board game and making candles fall over. See my review of the City Watch series embedded in my review of Guards!

(1989) Theatre of Cruelty (4 pages, free, online) Men at Arms (1993) Feet of Clay (1996) Jingo (1997) The Fifth Elephant (1999) Night Watch (2002) Thud (2005) Snuff (2011) (Series links at https://www.goodreads.com/series/1062... ) Oh--and Unseen Academicals (2009) is not really City Watch, but a few characters overlap. Related \"Modernization\" Series: Also, there are some spin-off books that cross-over with the \"City Watch\" sub-series. These books introduce new-fangled ideas to the twin cities of Ankh-Morpork. The books feature con-man turned hero, Moist Von Lipvig, and a few characters from the City Watch. Going Postal describes the invention and proliferation of postage stamps (loved it) and Making Money , depicts the creation of paper money to replace gold (also very good). Then there is Raising Steam , where Lord Vetinari makes Moist Von Lipvig introduce the steam train to the City, making it popular and profitable (not sure Pratchett wrote it -- not his best). Also, The Truth depicts the invention of a printing press and the subsequent introduction of widespread newspapers into society. Satire deals with the wholesale acceptance of lies when ink-validated. William de Worde (he-he) is the city's first investigative journalist, sleuthing out possible murder and a plot to overthrow Lord Vetinari. This book does not feature Moist Von Lipvig, but it has some City Watch characters. Finally, Moving Pictures introduces the film industry to the eager citizens of Ankh-Morpork. This book does not include Moist Von Lipvig. I didn't care as much for it, but it's brimming with satire and some scenes are great.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more 4.5 stars A terrific novel.

The city streets thrum with unrest. The dwarves and trolls are ready to turn the entire city into a battlefield. The anniversary of the Koom Valley is approaching. What was Koom Valley? As all of the Discworld know, it is the site of an historic battle between trolls and dwarves. It happened hundreds of years ago, but the aftereffects still ripple across the Discworld today. The hostilities explode. The tempers fry. And then, a prominent dwarf is murdered. Of course, a troll did it. Didn\u2019t he? While Sam Vimes and his Watch investigate, some self-righteous dwarves obstruct the investigation. It seems, they don\u2019t want the truth to come out. They want history to repeat itself. They want a bloodshed. Besides, the dwarfs are mining under the city, searching for something mystical. Secrets raise their ugly heads. Politics stir. Young enthusiasts bash each other\u2019s craniums. Even Lord Vetinary is concerned by the Watch\u2019s progress. The book isn\u2019t a light satirical romp, as most of the earlier Pratchett\u2019s books are. This one is scary in its intensity. The parallels with the current political situation, with the religious and national conflicts all around the world lead into the gray area of doubts. Sadly, we don\u2019t have our own Sam Vimes to bring around the lasting peace. Still, some scenes of the book are hysterically funny. As the weathered policemen Fred Colon and Nobby discuss art, the reader\u2019s eyes tear from laughter. When they discuss war, it\u2019s not so amusing. When Sam cogitates about a \u201cmalign idiot\u201d, a belligerent spiritual leader of the dwarves who incites his compatriots to take up arms, it\u2019s not funny at all. Young dwarves listened to him, because he talked about history and destiny and all the other words that always got trotted out to put a gloss on slaughter. It was heady stuff, except that brains were not involved. Sam doesn\u2019t consider himself a hero. Here he disagrees with the majority of Discworld, as well as with the devoted fans of the series, but his contemplation of police work, while a bit self-derisive, has some truth in it. Coppers stayed alive by trickery. That\u2019s how it worked . You had your Watch Houses with the big blue lights outside, and you made certain there were always burly watchmen visible in the big public places, and you swanked around like you own the place. But you didn\u2019t own it. It was all smoke and mirrors. You magicked a little policeman into everyone\u2019s head. You relied on people giving in, knowing the rules . But in truth, a hundred well-armed people could wipe-out the Watch, if they knew what they were doing. I\u2019m shivery just thinking about it, about all those terrorists and suicide bombers who effectively killed the little watchmen in their heads. I guess I\u2019m not very optimistic, and neither is Sam Vimes, but he is an honest copper and he has my deepest admiration and utmost respect. I salute you, Sam Vimes, and I bow to your creator. A wonderfully powerful book. ...more November 17, 2005 \"Is that my cow?\" I particularly like the side of Vimes who is such a good parent that regardless of what else he must contend with, he makes it a point to be there to read the bedtime book.

The following review will reflect this particular Discworld book only\u2026 Samuel Vimes, the no-nonsense Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, has his work cut out for him. With the upcoming anniversary of Koom Valley\u2014a historic battle between trolls and dwarfs\u2014all signs point to escalating hostility between the two species within his otherwise well-integrated city. Someone, or something , is out to restart an old war. When a dwarf is murdered and a troll blamed, it\u2019s up to Vimes and his loyal, diverse police force to somehow keep the peace\u2026 and perhaps prevent another Koom Valley in their midst. Time for Sam to break out the hard-boiled investigative skills. \u201cWhy bother with a cunning plan when a simple one will do?\u201d From early on my brain decided the character of Sam Vimes should be cast by David Tenant\u2014probably because his Broadchurch persona seemed suitably applicable (with a dash of Dr. Who thrown in for my own amusement.) But it wasn\u2019t until we meet Sam\u2019s toddler son, and learn that Sam has made it an unshakeable paternal priority to read to said son at precisely 6PM every evening, that I truly became attached to the character. And in this reader\u2019s opinion, the threading through of the children\u2019s book played a large role in the keen and endearing genius of this whole tale. \u201cWHERE\u2019S MY COW? ARE YOU MY COW?\u201d It\u2019s safe to conclude that Pratchett isn\u2019t just parodying the fantasy genre (although, he\u2019s delightfully good at it!), he\u2019s parodying\u2014and in his own way, confronting\u2014a complex menagerie of issues. Western society, racial tensions, outmoded traditionalism, historical revisionism, cultural chauvinism, drug use\u2026 he takes aim at all of these and gets away with it thanks to an expert layering of guile, tongue-in-cheek humor, and measured poignancy. In this reader\u2019s mind, that makes him an intrepid social commentator. (Considering the creatures inhabiting Discworld are from an array of TRULY different races (i.e. species), it roundly highlights the absurdity of this reality\u2019s ethnic and cultural divides.) The narrative jumps around a bit, including a range of third person perspectives meant to give readers insight into the larger political and social situation. The characterization is whimsical and precise, the dialogue is pithy, and the world-building is deftly handled. Everything weaves around and back together with a thoroughness that feels like a gift I didn\u2019t even realize I wanted until Pratchett handed it to me, all tied up neat and pretty. If I had one complaint, it would be the length. There were times the action was low for extended periods and it felt almost as though the author was rabbit-trailing. (Oh me of little faith, I know.) Of course, some of this could simply be a result of perfectly necessary scenes involving characters that I had less investment in. In any case, my interest sometimes wandered more than I, personally, would have liked.

Particular highlights for me in this one were the changes in Sam upon the birth of his son and the consequent exploration of Sam's untapped potential for violence in the name of right. Also, I laughed a lot. Also also, Vetinari. Who knows what's to come, but if this is the last Watch novel we get, the world will be just a little bit less bright. ...more I always start off not really fully enjoying these books, but then by the halfway point I can barely stop. As always, Pratchett is hilarious, yet very poignant. I didn't really like the Fred/Nobby storyline in this one, it felt somewhat fragmented, and not fully present. I realized the morning after I read the book, however, that this may be because of Terry's Alzheimer's. Not to mention the plotline with Nobby's girlfriend was a little too cliche and not subversive enough. Better review later. I believe that this is my favorite Discworld novel that I've read so far! (And I've read quite a few of them.) This one transcends the one-note satire that many of the Discworld books feature (each one takes on a certain topic - this one has a theme of racial tolerance).

This installment of the series also pokes gentle fun at the mystery genre - but, while doing so, is itself a quite good mystery novel! It actually kicks the crap out of any of the glut of 'paranormal investigation' novels that have become quite the trend of late... by any measure. The premise - a dwarf turns up dead. The club lying next to his body would seem to indicate that a troll did the job. But wait - that clue is so obvious that it seems it must've been planted. Perhaps it's a plot to discredit trolls? But then - a troll WAS actually at the scene of the crime! Commander Vimes of the City Watch must investigate - but the particulars of this case aren't the only thing he has to worry about, as he tries to manage the potential conflicts between his employees - especially the werewolf Sergeant Angua and his new vampire recruit - and the city seems to be sliding toward full-blown ethnic conflict. ...more How pleasing is Thud! ? Well, it depend what you're looking for. If you're looking for the next chapter in the story of our beloved characters in the Watch, it's pretty disappointing. Far too much of what we are given here feels like repetition from earlier novels, and much of the rest is ultimately trivial and goes nowhere. Neither the characters nor the themes here are substantially advanced from previous installments, and as a result I was deeply disappointed when I first read this. I had been How pleasing is Thud! ?

Neither the characters nor the themes here are substantially advanced from previous installments, and as a result I was deeply disappointed when I first read this. I had been waiting so many years for a new Watch novel, after the brilliant double punch of The Fifth Elephant and Night Watch and THIS is what I was given!? And it didn't help that the novel itself is horribly anticlimactic, with an ending that I don't think works on any level, and that the whole thing feels a little bloated compared to the earlier books, while simultaneously feeling rushed. But now I read it differently. Terry Pratchett is dead, there will be no more Discworld, and the disconsolate reader must find their fix where they can get it. So if you're just looking for another little fix of Pratchett... well then suddenly the book is a lot more impressive. It's pretty clever. It's really tense. It's amazingly funny - it's not the funniest thing he's written, by some margin, but I'd sort of expected that by this point he'd never be this funny again, that wry smiles were all we were to expect. Instead, I laughed out loud on multiple occasions. Look at it this way: imagine Discworld is your favourite network TV show. Thud! is one of those episodes you get really frustrated by when it turns up one week: it's a bland procedural episode that you've sort of seen before; it doesn't really advance the overarching plot of the season; it has the characters acting stupidly and annoyingly - not out of character exactly, but the from the annoying sides of their character; there's no great structural invention, no unusual theme, no stand-out scene or performance, no famous lines you'll be quoting for years; it's not even memorably awful, it's just... one of those forgettable episodes. And when you've waited all week for it, you may even get a bit pissed off that they're wasting your time with this stuff. And yet, when the show's over, and you miss it, and you turn on the TV and happen to catch an episode and it's this one, suddenly... well, you see it differently. Because it's not an unusual episode, an outstanding one, a landmark one, it's just one of the normal, representative ones. It does what that show did, and it does it really pretty well, and it's exciting to watch and it's funny and you get to spend time with the characters, and maybe you even come away glad that that's the episode you caught, rather than one of the big dramatic ones that's maybe better quality but you don't quite get the time to just relax in the company of your TV-show-'friends' and watch them at work on an ordinary day. Thud! is that kind of book. (For further explanation of this view, you can see my longer review on my blog ) ...more Oh, he's good. He's very good. Sam Vimes and the City Watch is the only Discworld arc that I don't think I've ever tired of two thirds of the way through a book, and I'm so glad I picked this one up. It's a very well-crafted whodunnit, with a rich and complicated backdrop and a well-rounded and thoroughly interesting cast. The pace is spot on. The parallels to the real world, and the Serious Issues, while undeniably serious and difficult, are not particularly in-your-face or preachey. Well, may Oh, he's good. He's very good.

But you can't be the world's straightest copper and not get a little bit preachey, and Pratchett did spend the vast majority of the book impressively managing to avoid it. I have also, on a side note, discovered that \"Where's My Cow?\" is an actual real-life book (a Discworld companion one, of course). I don't know why this should amuse me so much, but I'm quite tempted to try and track it down. ...more Sniff...sniff... Now I know why Anne Elisabeth Stengl says this author has the power to make you cry and laugh within sentences. The storyline with Sam and little Sam...wow...just wow.... I will try to refrain from asking you all, yet again, why you are not yet reading Terry Pratchett (if indeed, you are not). Whoops, too late. Thud is a Discworld novel, focusing, as most of the more recent books have, on Sam Vimes, the Commander of the Watch in the city of Ankh-Morph, and the troubles that ensue when the ethnic tensions arise between the local Trolls and Dwarfs, who had been generally in peace, despite traditions of enmity between the two groups.

Basically, a group of fundamentalist \"deep-down\" trolls have arrived in town, preaching about the old ways, and trouble has ensued. Before you roll your eyes at the words Dwarves and Trolls, understand that while these books are set in a fantasy setting, they have little or nothing to do with traditional fantasy fiction. The Discworld books began as satires on classic sword and fairy fantasy novels, and have evolved, over time, to become novels that take on some of the most interesting issues of our times, under the guise of satiric fantasy. Such as, in this case, ethnic prejudice, religious fundamentalism, and the importance of law and justice over revenge. And, the love a father has for his son, gender relations on the police force, the necessity of politics and compromise, and the pretty-woman/jerk syndrome. All these important ideas under the covers of a totally enjoyable page turner - not a heavy novel of ideas. What I am saying is, Terry Pratchett is awesome. I enjoyed Thud immensely. As always, I found the climax of the thing a teeny bit hard to follow - I don't know if that's because I read the books a wee bit too quickly, or if Pratchett gets so wrapped up in his own ideas and confusing situations that he misses the thread a little bit. I always know what happens at the end, but I have a little bit of a hard time following in the thick of things. Other than that, I loved it - I particularly loved Vimes determination to be home at six every night to read to Young Sam - I got a lump in my throat about it, and I want a copy of Where's My Cow? for my very own. You really should be ready the Discworld novels. The only hitch is that the more you read the better they are, and the more you get out of them, so the first one might put you a little bit in medias res, and it might take a couple before you are completely up to speed. But it's worth it for page-turning crowd-pleasing fiction that also has something important to say. ...more \u00cd dag er \u00e1r s\u00ed\u00f0an a\u00f0 Terry Pratchett l\u00e9st.

As such, the gold is almost gone from the cover, the pages are falling out, and the covers themselves are battered beyond saving. I must have read this book at least 25 times, if not more. Well, here's a no-brainer. A fantasy book with a grumpy and unwillingly badass policeman? A comedy with underlying important race issues? Yes please. Thud! was the first Pratchett that I read, and the first book I ever had which actually fitted in my handbag of the time (I've now got a decent book-sized one). As such, the gold is almost gone from the cover, the pages are falling out, and the covers themselves are battered beyond saving. I must have read this book at least 25 times, if not more. So much so, that I can actually quote entire pages. But I digress. This is a review, after all. Thud! also had the advantage of being the first comedy/fantasy book I'd ever got my hands on, and, as such, I was hooked from the first page. The characters are extraordinarily vivid, the setting entirely random on the surface and possibly in the depths too, and, to top it all off, Carrot. Need I say more? Basically, stop reading this, and start reading the actual book. Now. ...more Uma nova hist\u00f3ria no arco da Guarda da Cidade e, como Night Watch, mais sombria, tamb\u00e9m.

I had never read any other Terry Pratchett books but was familiar with the name because I have shelved quite a few. I was at a branch waiting to observe a YA program and got there a bit early so I was browsing the shelves looking for something to listen to in my car and came across this one. I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!!!! There was no sense of having missed anything from having not read the other books in the Discworld series; this was really a stand-alone book.

I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!!!! There was no sense of having missed anything from having not read the other books in the Discworld series; this was really a stand-alone book. The writing was funny and clever and I laughed out loud a lot. My Mom even laughed out loud a couple of times when she was with me in the car, and she didn't even know what was happening in the story. The characters were a lot of fun. Sergeant Angua, a werewolf, and Lance-Constable Sally, a vampire, are thrown together a couple of times, to Angua's great distress - werewolves and vampires just don't get along - and at one point she reminds Sally that they are NOT bonding. There was a great conversation between Corporal Nobbs and Sergeant Colon about what constitutes art - when do you know it's a naked body and when is it art? They decide if there is an urn in the painting, it is art. Commander Vimes MUST be home at 6pm promptly to read Where's My Cow to his infant son (Is that my cow? It goes 'baaa.' That's not my cow!) The CD was read by Stephen Briggs, who did an amazing job. I loved how he read the troll Brick's thoughts - I always felt there must be a \"duh\" coming along the way. There were different voices and accents for everyone, so it was no problem keeping track of who was speaking at any given moment, no small feat considering the sizeable character list. This book was just tremendous fun and I would recommend it highly. ...more definitely one of my favorite terry pratchett books, especially in the city watch series. this one is beautifully crafted and creates a path that a reader must follow all the way to the end in order to resolve. sam vines himself proves once again to be \"as straight as an arrow\", and yet is full of criminal character flaws, which makes him one of the best developed characters that i have ever read. as for the whole koom valley business, i love the way mr. pratchett has created this world that is definitely one of my favorite terry pratchett books, especially in the city watch series. this one is beautifully crafted and creates a path that a reader must follow all the way to the end in order to resolve. sam vines himself proves once again to be \"as straight as an arrow\", and yet is full of criminal character flaws, which makes him one of the best developed characters that i have ever read. as for the whole koom valley business, i love the way mr. pratchett has created this world that is so real and yet so magical. of course dwarves hate trolls and vice versa, the anesmity between them is vivid and fresh in your mind as commander vimes meets mr. shine and grag bashfullson, and yet, just like vimes, you can't pick a side, because that would just be silly. perhaps all you can do, is sit down to a game of thud and play not only from your viewpoint, but the other's as well. as a professor of mine once said, perspective is everything. thumbs up again to mr pratchett and yet another wonderful story of intrigue.

There is also some nice comment on the modern world. I especially like the organiser \u2013 it is actually useful here! The i-pod was a bit more un-believable, but this is a magic world after all. Sam actually scores a point off Vetinari. If you have a good imagination there\u2019s also a wonderfully comic scene with cabbages. If you haven\u2019t read it already, then I strongly suggest you put a day or two aside, because you won\u2019t want to put it down. ...more I believe it was Patrick Rothfuss who, in his review of this book, said that it was in many ways a conclusion to the story that started with Feet of Clay . I find myself agreeing with this. If anything, the story began with Men at Arms ( Guards! Guards! feels more like an introductory book than an actual part of the story), and it has been a story about racial and cultural diversity, ancestral hatred, and what different people do with power. It's really a meaningful story. I keep this book around to make me cry. It works every time. It's about a lot of things, and one thing. The one thing is racism, but there's little things swimming around in it, and one of those is fatherhood and what it means to be a father. The sections that taught me about that are pages 110-122 and 324- 336. Don't grab a copy just to read those; it might not have the same emotional impact. Read the book. Yes, it's the 7th in a miniseries, but Terry was good in making them stand alone. Read it I keep this book around to make me cry. It works every time. It's about a lot of things, and one thing.
