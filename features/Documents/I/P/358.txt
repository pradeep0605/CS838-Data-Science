Completely awful. Holy hell. What happened? Summary of <+++>Requiem</+++>: Lena leads Julian on to make Alex jealous. That's it. That's the whole book. Lena... what happened to you? You were bland in Delirium , had this AMAZING character growth in Pandemonium , and here? You were petty and whiny and annoying. Criminy. She asked to leave behind a burned, injured, defenseless girl who had just lost her home and family all because she was jealous that Alex talked to her. Way to be a shitty person, Lena! The Lena/<---C>Hana</---C> back and forth POV chapters were okay. Hana's story was better than Lena's story. At least Hana had some character development, unlike anyone else in the book. I didn't even like Lena anymore. Her character growth from the second book was basically stomped out. Instead of character development, she had recession of character development . Julian was totally forgettable here, his only purpose being to make Alex jealous for Lena and not having any further character development either. Guess it was all used up in Pandemonium. (SUCH GOOD CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IN PANDEMONIUM!!!! WHAT HAPPENED HERE HOLY BALLS). Oh, and there was Alex. Alex, who was a HUGE ASSHOLE THE ENTIRE BOOK. (view spoiler) [Oh, he wanted to give Lena up and let her go so he decided to lie and hurt her at every chance he got and be a huge asshole instead. HOW SELF-SACRIFICING!!!! BUT NOPE ALL IS FORGIVEN BECAUSE HE LEFT A NOTE THAT SAID FORGIVE ME AND HE STILL LOVES HER!!!! (TOLD TO LENA BY HIS TWO-SECOND GIRLFRIEND THAT HE PROBABLY GOT JUST TO KEEP LENA AWAY AND HURT HER MORE.) THAT EXCUSES EVERYTHING!!!!!!!! And because Alex/Lena are endgame during the last five pages of the book, why not just make sure the book is chock-full of Lena/Julian scenes just for the hell of it??? I guess Julian's purpose of teaching Lena how to let go and move on and love again was totally bullshit. Julian, why the hell were you even introduced as a love interest for Lena in the first place then? Just to make a really shitty, unneeded love triangle? Just to be strung along by Lena the entire time for her to make Alex jealous? Biggest cop-out ever. She had absolutely no respect for Julian's feelings at all. Everything was about ALEX. Here, Lena, have another 'really shitty person' award. My respect I had for you in the second book completely vanished. Let me quote the one of the last pages of Pandemonium: \"Promise me we'll stay together, okay? You and me.\" - Julian \"I promise.\" - Lena \"Don't believe her.\" - Alex YEP, DON'T BELIEVE HER, JULIAN. Also, the start of huge asshole!Alex. Newsflash: You could've tried to give her up and let her go without being a huge asshole. WOAH!!!!!!! Also, this makes no fucking sense in general. Alex wanted to let her go and give her up or some bullshit, so he goes and basically tells someone else who wants to make her happy to back off???? I guess since it can't be him, even though it was HIS decision, it can't be anyone! LOL. And then for the hell of it, to top it all off, let's hurry up end it all with the most anti-climactic, lazy ending ever that leaves everybody feeling bereft and disappointed. Like, open-ended isn't bad if it's done right... yeah, this wasn't. All this felt like was a huge cop-out. We find out NOTHING. Besides making an enormous fucking deal out of the stupid love triangle, this book--the SERIES--was all a huge build-up to this moment... and what? I feel like the end was Gene Wilder yelling at me . There is waaaay too much shit that's left unresolved. OH WELL AT LEAST ALEX AND LENA GET BACK TOGETHER, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY ALL THAT MATTERS!!!!!!!!!!!! (hide spoiler) ] I can't even give this two stars. The prose was as beautiful as always, but not even that can save it. My hope that the series could be good after Pandemonium crashed down and I just. I can't. I really don't think a book has ever disappointed me so much. I probably shouldn't have gone in with such high expectations after the greatness that was Pandemonium, but I did. ONE FUCKING STAR . (view spoiler) [Also, no, bad rating is not from being butthurt about the love triangle not ending in my favor. I wasn't really invested in this series in the first place to really mind either way. I did prefer Julian, but liked Alex as he was in the FIRST BOOK, AKA, a fine fellow and not a huge asshole. Even if I had wanted them to be endgame, this still would've gotten a bad rating from me. Bad rating is from no character development--RECESSION of character development for Lena, Lena being a shitty person in general, shitty empty ending, Alex being shitty, the book's main focus being the stupidly annoying love triangle, and the nonexistent plot being completely unmemorable.

I think Lena was waaay more whiny when she first became an invalid than the rich kid Julian and I really admired him for that. He also has the urge of protecting Lena though he is not capable of doing that. MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! On to Alex. He has another love interest here. (view spoiler) [Name's Coral. (hide spoiler) ] And was trying to avoid Lena and Julian. He was not in real action here actually, mostly he was described as aloof and snobbish especially to Lena and Julian. He often hangs out with the new girl, knees touching blah blah blah. And then he saves Lena's ass. Again. Though Lena managed to save Alex too (view spoiler) [from the bear. (hide spoiler) ] Alex is still Alex. The one who is willing to sacrifice his own happiness for Lena's sake. The sweet sweet guy that we all love. Annabel: She and Lena made up :) Raven, Tack, Hunter, Bram, Lu, Coral: They're Lena's constant companions here, although not all of them made through and there is some kind of (view spoiler) [betrayal (hide spoiler) ] that shocks Lena. Hana: She has a MAJOR role in this. She describes how the cure worked on her. Her feelings, or the lack thereof, and her fear that the cure didn't properly work constantly bugs her. I know I hated Hana not so long ago because of her freaking jealousy, but she kinda made up for it. She has contributed greatly to the Invalid's cause, although she is a cured person herself. Who did Lena choose? I love it that Oliver did not spell it out for us. She left me hanging but in a completely content way. I felt satisfied. I know Lena chose him but she is not rushing it. She loves the other one and she will take things slow, figure out how to proceed from there. How to fix things. At least that's the way I thought it meant. <---A>Lauren Oliver</---A>: I said it before and I'll say it again. YOU ARE A GENIUS. I don't know how you do it but you made my heart happy. You've told a wonderful story that I am sure I'll never forget it. You made Lena so strong but still realistic. She's not a superhuman, not perfect but she's brave. She loves. She cares (view spoiler) [even for Coral (hide spoiler) ] , and she stands up for what she believes. Now that's a remarkable heroine. BEFORE READING: OH GEEZ. THIRD BOOK!!! I hope the world won't end in 2012. *enters the much dreaded love triangle* surprise surprise! *thousands of rolling eyes ooh Aleeeeeeeeex! Your minimal appearance in Pandemonium is not enough!! EDIT: Anyway, the third book will be from Lena and Hana's POV.. okay. I hope it'll be told from Alex's POV though :( But I guess this story centers more on the political stuff, not the romance dept so putting Hana's POV, being a cured one, fits right. But I kinda hate her. (view spoiler) [She was the one who sold Lena and Alex to the authorities! Envious bitch!

I hate when authors sway to far from the original plot of the series, which was exactly what Lauren Oliver has done in this latest installment. The ~EDIT #3~ ACTUAL REVIEW ( SPOILERS AHEAD ): Okay, I know a lot of people have read/liked my 'review' for the ending of Pandemonium and the blurb of requiem, but here's my long-awaited review of Lauren Oliver's Requiem. I'm going to be very, very honest here. I didn't like it. Compared to the awesomeness that was Delirium, this was honestly disappointing. I hate when authors sway to far from the original plot of the series, which was exactly what Lauren Oliver has done in this latest installment. The first book was an exciting tale about two people who were in love, and were determined to keep it that way, despite the costs. Alex and Lena's love story was thrilling and interesting, due to the circumstances of their illegal romance and having the characters experience emotions that were entirely new to them. The second book added more depth to the rebellion side to the plot, but still continued with a forbidden love story between Lena and Julian (no matter how much we may have hated Julian, it was still true to the trilogy's origins of forbidden love). But this book felt sort of...flat. ESPECIALLY since the ending to the last book was so shocking and exciting, the way Oliver continues the story is disappointing. Firstly, you'll have to forgive me for leaving out some detail, I read the book over a year ago and I'm only just getting around to the review. But I remember that I was really pissed that the start of this book didn't pick up right after the last book finished. I wanted to know what Lena's immediate reaction was, I wanted to know what was said after \"Don't believe her.\", I wanted to know their first conversation. I NEEDED TO NOW THESE THINGS BUT I NEVER GOT THE ANSWERS. There was no spark between Alex and Lena. Their love had been so passionate and intense in the first book, and I honestly refuse to believe that the air between them was so tense. Like yeah, Julian was a big bump in the road, but knowing Alex he would have understood. She obviously believed he was dead, and grief doesn't equal 'not able to find love again'. Overall, I just wasn't interested in the plot either. I was so focused on wanting Alex to reconcile with Lena that nothing else sparked my interest. Also, for a book with such bland emotion and frustrating (not in the good way) plot, the ending was awful. Yes, with some books you can get away with an ending that's very brief and vague, but this series needed more. The plot was just too BIG to end like it did. It was in dire need of an explanatory epilogue. Oh well, some books are just duds. Whatever. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~EDIT #2~ BLURB THINGY: \"After rescuing Julian from a death sentence, Lena and her friends fled to the Wilds. But the Wilds are no longer a safe haven\u2014pockets of rebellion have opened throughout the country, and the government cannot deny the existence of Invalids. Regulators now infiltrate the borderlands to stamp out the rebels, and as Lena navigates the increasingly dangerous terrain, her best friend, Hana, lives a safe, loveless life in Portland as the fianc\u00e9e of the young mayor. Requiem is told from both Lena\u2019s and Hana\u2019s points of view. The two girls live side by side in a world that divides them until, at last, their stories converge.\" Ha, I love how the description/blurb says NOTHING about Alex coming back. Probably JUST to torture us that wee bit more ;) But I love this, and I can't wait for Lena to meet up again with Hana. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~EDIT~ THE COVER. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This is what my reaction when I realised Alex was back: and then this: and This is what I did when I saw that it was the last page of the book: and THIS is what I did when I saw the expected publication date of Requiem: and this. I hope there's someone else out there who understands that in the whole book of Pandemonium, I was basically just waiting for Alex to burst into the situation saying, \"I WILL FIX EVERYTHING!\". BUT NO. He came on the very last page of the book. Now miss Lauren Oliver is making me wait an awful 8 MONTHS FOR THE NEXT BOOK. ...more OMGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!

Delirium TV Show Casting: Alex and Hana have been cast... for better or worse? ...there is another book right? The DELIRIUM series cannot end this way, so vague and unfinished. Disappointed doesn't begin to cover how I feel. The beginning was slow, and the ending was rushed, sooo rushed... and unclear, and incomplete, and preachy, and not at all what I was expecting. It felt short, the whole book did. So she went back to the wilds and lived crappily ever after? Is that what I am getting? Felt like a bridge between books, nothing was really solved, and we were left with more questions than answers. While Pandemonium was a revelation, Requiem was the book that fell short. Guess it was too much to hope Requiem would be just as good. We get NO answers. At the end it's like nothing is resolved, not even the love triangle (that no one believed in the first place anyways). I was already suspecting this was going to happen, when I reached the middle of the book (and a little after) and nothing significant had yet happened. We got a confrontation in the romance department (ONE! And not even after they meet face to face for the first time, woah was I pissed!), true, but other than that? Nada!! This book was definitely dissapointing. We still get beautiful writing, and it was GREAT to get to see the characters we love again, but it felt like a bridge book. No resolution, no ENDING. Just, all left in the air... The rest of this review shall be full of spoilers, so read if you must, I have a lot of talking to do about specific parts that pissed.me.off. (view spoiler) [By the end there she is with a child (Grace), reconciles with Alex (barely?) yet hasn't broken up with Julian even though she finally realized she will never love him as much as she loves Alex (DUH!) Their reconciliation (Alex and Lena) wasn't even that romantic or sweet. It was business like. Oh yeah I love you, you love me, let's not even make eye contact as we are saying this in THE MIDDLE OF A FUCKING ATTACK. Then Lena goes off, stares at Julian's bare chest on her way to a half pummeled wall (guess old habits die hard?) WITH A CHILD to help tear it down some more? WHAT THE HELL IS SHE GOING TO DO? ATTACK THE WALL WITH HER FISTS? SHE AIN'T FUCKING MADE OF STEEL! And the most ridiculous thing of all is the last paragraph where Lauren Oliver tries to tie everything with words of wisdom that quite frankly fell flat. After everything we went through Delirium and Pandemonium do you really think a half assed paragraph was going to make me HAPPY? I am furious! The last paragraph could be summarized with the song by Avril Lavigne titled \"Keep Holding on\". Does this mean we get a sequel? To hold on for a brighter tomorrow in which the ending to one of my favorite series isn't this? I damn hope so. And I haven't even started talking about Hana's grand finale. She finds out there is a bomb at the house she is to live with her fucking psycho jerk of a husband and she just goes off the backdoor, never looking back. Did the husband explode? WHO KNOWS! Did Hana ever find Lena again? No fucking clue. What is she going to do now? Hell, you got me there! And the way she does a complete 180 there at the end on the way she treats Lena and stuff after everything we have read from her POV? Nope, don't believe it. She treats Lena like she barely knows her even though she has been agonizing about her in every other page we read. Dumbfounding! Is Hana's husband (the creepy psycho new mayor that quite possibly killed his father) even dead? No one knows! I didn't read about an explosion, how about you? Oh and why doesn't Lena break up with Julian? My personal opinion is that Lauren Oliver dug herself a deep hole she doesn't want to get herself out of. Julian only joined the resistance because of Lena, only to find out this girl has been stringing him along this whole time? Fuck, if she series were to continue Julian could become the ultimate super villain! He is smart, hot, from a well respected family, and has a bone to pick with love. Ultimate Super Villain. Couldn't blame the guy. And Alex? Don't make me talk about him now, MY Alex died in Delirium. This new ball of hatred is not Alex. He is just not the guy any of us fell in love with, and you know why? BECAUSE HE DOESN'T GET ENOUGH PAGE TIME. If Hana could tell her story by GODS let Alex tell his side! All we get is confused old Lena who doesn't know her ass from her elbows. I am sure our Alex never return because he never got a chance. So much time was put into veering us into the wrong conclusion of who was going to win Lena's heart that we didn't have enough reading space to fall in love with Alex all over again, hell we didn't even have time to reconnect! Lena and her mother reunite. That was done right, I believe it. Lena is a big ball of feels, she would have forgiven her mother that easily. She never spoke top her about Alex though, in the entire book. You would think that small part of her live (the entire first book right?) would come up in conversation. Coral, we hate her, we love her... I kind of liked her at the end. She seemed cool when not looked through Lena's eyes. The war was never resolved. They won a battle (I think? They were definitely halfway through when the book ended...) in Portland, but they definitely didn't win any wars! OH and after reading Raven's story, to find out she was pregnant (something that was NEVER referred to or addressed in Requiem) and she just DIES? Not even fighting or like the leader she is, she is climbing up some stairs, pokes her head out, and gets shot. Tack comes to console her, and we never read about them two again. Was the shot fatal? Maybe! Was she still pregnant by then? I don't know? Did Tack know? etc etc, nothing was addressed and everything was left up in the air. (hide spoiler) ] Old updates: *Now in order to read the Alex short story you would have to buy a first edition copy of Requiem. Like we weren't doing that anyways! Edit 9/20/12 Am I the only one who is completely jealous and wants to scream at the top of her lungs to the gods because some people have already read this book and not me? AM I THE ONLY ONE? I can't possibly be! -- I know burning books is bad, but if Lena doesn't end up with Alex there will be blood. Julian was a good distraction, and hell he was so cute all around, but Alex pulls at my heart strings. Gosh that ending [Pandemonium] was awesome, the whole book was written perfectly.

You would be reading the book instead. So I\u2019m going to skip all of the fluffy, do-good particles that this book is made of, and delve deeper into the reason for my rating change. I anticipated Requiem ever since the cliffhanger at the end of Pandemonium (which I loved, by the way) and literally counted down the days to its release (I even wrote it on my calendar. And who uses calendars anymore, amirite?) Pandemonium was a page turner. It had everything that I\u2019d ever wanted in a book \u2013 unique writing that seemed almost vivid and scarily real, lots of character development, and the ending just \u2013 UHHH. The ending picked you up and slammed you down right as we figure out that Alex is alive. Just before it kicks the door closed: sorry! You have to wait until the next book comes out to see what happened afterwards! . And so I waited. Patiently, twiddling my thumbs, watching anime and crying about it, you know \u2013 the stuff I do. I re-read Delirium and Pandemonium over again, just to get myself ready for what was sure to be the most AH-MAZ-ING CONCLUSION TO ANY SERIES EVER. ANNNNDDDDDD IT STARTS OFF\u2026with nothing. Nothin\u2019 . \u2026 Oh sure, Pandemonium can start off right where Delirium ended, but this book can\u2019t do the same, especially when I sensed an ass-whoopin\u2019 coming? Naw, that\u2019s just cheap. Let us fast forward and not even care/giveashit about Lena\u2019s first encounter with Alex, after everything that had happened between them. But okay, yeah\u2026chilled\u2026I chilled down. I ignored that glaringly obvious thing that I didn\u2019t like, and I continued. A quarter way through : oh boy, can\u2019t wait for some action to happen. Surely Hana\u2019s going to do something awesome and redeem herself, or Lena\u2019s going to kick some ass\u2026 Half way through : Okay, the action can start any time now\u2026uh\u2026please? I already know who Lena\u2019s going to end up with, but just make it work, k? Three quarters : Umm\u2026something? Anything? Please? It feels like this book hasn\u2019t even started yet. Can I already be this far in? And so, the first three quarters of this book was filled with the kind of blah-blah-blah that belongs in soap operas, with a couple raids thrown here and there. Though, as glued as I was to the amazing/flawless writing, I found myself\u2026disappointed. Nothing major occurs, like what you\u2019d expect in the final book. Hana\u2019s point of view was interesting at times, but definitely not what I imagined her to sound like. Sure, she made a few character developments, but overall, Hana was another bland cured that brought almost nothing to the story line, besides a slightly creepy edge. At three quarters in, I couldn\u2019t help but think\u2026 \u201dIs this it? It\u2019s almost the end. Where are the explanations? Where are the revelations? It feels\u2026empty, somehow, like a bunch of pages were ripped out. Did I buy a faulty copy? AND NOT WIN AN ARC? (I\u2019m still frustrated about that, to be honest.) At that point, I felt kind of ripped off. The scene with Lena and her mother made me want to tear my hair out \u2013 we were never given any explanation, any stories or view from \u201cBee\u201d. What was it like in the Crypts? How had she managed to climb to the top of the ranks? In such an emotion-filled book, there was no feelings between Lena and her mother. It almost pained me to read their confrontations. Lifeless . Like the time I fell asleep on the library floor at my school after an all-nighter at a relay-for-life. (I was practically a zombie, besides being served ice cream at 3:30 a.m. and someone blasting dubstep in a vain attempt for all of us to stay awake) But sure, I could ignore that huge punch in the face. But what I couldn\u2019t handle \u2013 and what changed my view on this entire book \u2013 was the ending. That FUCKING ending. I\u2019m sorry. I usually don\u2019t swear in reviews, (view spoiler) [(yes I do) (hide spoiler) ] but that needed to be said. How many times have you encountered something so mind-numbingly painful that you just had to let a few choice words slip out? And let me tell you \u2013 there is nothing more frustrating than Requiem , nay, this whole series\u2019 ending. Remember when we all read Breaking Dawn when we were all in that cray-cray Twilight phase? Remember how it just ended ? It didn\u2019t really have any closure. There was no fight \u2013 the fight that everyone was preparing for, that everyone was worried about, the fight that I was completely sure was about to happen \u2013 and then everyone just talks. They talk it out for fucks sake . And then it ends. Just like that. It\u2019s like the end of Mockingjay , but worse. That\u2019s basically what happens in the end of Requiem . The first two books and the first \u00be of the third hype you up towards a fantastic ending that\u2019s sure to blow your mind \u2013 or at least resolve the conflict between main characters. NOPE . It ends. You have no idea what happens to ANYONE. It actually stops halfway through the showdown \u2013 they had just barely taken the town, and then the pages run out. \u201cI\u2019VE BEEN CHEAPED! RIPPED! BAMBOOZLED!\u201d But what angers me the most is the Lena/Alex/Julian triangle. It\u2019s never resolved. It just isn\u2019t . Lena and Alex admit their love for each other, even though Lena has been leading Julian on for this entire time and Lena never talks to Julian at the end. They tear down a wall. You never find out what happens to Hana. You don\u2019t know if any other important characters die \u2013 what happened to Tack? Or Hunter and Bram? What about Hana\u2019s almost-husband? Does he actually die? What about Coral? What about Lena\u2019s mother? Her aunt? Jenny? Is Lena ever going to tell Julian that her and Alex are getting back together? What happens after they tear down the wall to the Wilds? Will they take the other towns too? There is no closure . How hard would it have been to shove in a little scene in the end, resolving Lena/Alex/Julian, and actually telling what happens afterwards? How hard would it have been to ACTUALLY WRITE AN ENDING? \u201cI\u2019VE BEEN LEFT HANGING OFF A CLIFF! WHERE\u2019S THE ROPE? A STICK? ANYTHING, PLEASE!\u201d Poor Julian. Selfish Lena led him on, and then once Alex admits his love, she\u2019ll just throw him to the side like he\u2019s nothing. But wait \u2013 even Lena says she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next. Will she choose Alex, or Julian? \u201cISN\u2019T THIS WHY WE READ THIS BOOK IN THE FIRST PLACE?\u201d Here\u2019s what I think happened \u2013 Mrs. Oliver was so concerned about teaching the reader a lesson that she forgot to actually have this book make sense. Her lesson - supposed lesson - is that you\u2019re not supposed to know what happens next. [image error] \u201d Taking this in a lesson view, as in \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re not supposed to know what comes next in love - it\u2019s a valid point. Hearty, even. But taking this from a \u201cI-just-stuck-with-this-series-because-I-though-it-was-awesome-and-was-sorely-dissapointed-when-I-realized-that-the-author-didn\u2019t-even-give-us-an-ending\u201d view, it\u2019s a bit of a dick move. The obvious strain to get this message through overshadowed the actual need to take care of her characters and portray them as something other than the means to get to an actual point (which, in my opinion, never actually came to light). If you want something deep and semi-emotional, then this ending should suit to your needs. But the more I thought about it, and since I felt cheated, I refused to this of this as anything other than a sham. So, as much as I loved the first two books, Requiem was a mistake. A very bad mistake, seeing as the overall rating for this book dropped from a 4.30 before it was released to almost a 3.87 after it came out. That just goes to show that (hopefully) others feel the same way. AND NO \u2013 THIS IS NO AN EXCUSE TO WRITE MORE BOOKS and/or MAKE A SPIN-OFF. PlEaSe DoN\u2019t. THIS SERIES HAS BEEN FUCKED UP ENOUGH BY THIS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. (Final rating \u2013 2.5. I\u2019m feeling very generous this afternoon. I have been emotionally ruined. Thank you.)

But oh my gosh, the ending of Pandemonium was awkward. I felt so bad for Alex...

When all good things must come to an end. A horrible, horrible end that didn\u2019t do any justice to the series. But an end nonetheless. Requiem is like sitting down to a well-deserved, hot pie and relishing every bite until you get to the last one and die of poisoning without ever knowing why or how. There was literally a moment when I got to the last few pages, realized there wasn\u2019t any more and freaked out. From enjoyment for insurmountable anger. I am a solid believer that Lauren Oliver Requiem. When all good things must come to an end. A horrible, horrible end that didn\u2019t do any justice to the series. But an end nonetheless. Requiem is like sitting down to a well-deserved, hot pie and relishing every bite until you get to the last one and die of poisoning without ever knowing why or how. There was literally a moment when I got to the last few pages, realized there wasn\u2019t any more and freaked out. From enjoyment for insurmountable anger. I am a solid believer that Lauren Oliver is a capable, talented author. I also think she\u2019s brave. Not all authors risk venturing into unfamiliar territory. Think how common it is for an author to be writing their fourth or fifth book in a series and starting spinoffs in the same world when even that gets old. It\u2019s clear from Delirium that Oliver was trying on something new. Uncomfortable at first, but I\u2019d felt that in Pandemonium, she had hit her stride. Requiem, the last part of Lena\u2019s journey, seems to have been a new challenge all in its own. One that I didn\u2019t feel Oliver managed to surmount. The novel is divvied up into Lena\u2019s POV and Hannah\u2019s POV \u2013 sometimes done with more success than other times. Overall, it wasn\u2019t a bad series and Requiem wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad book. It simply could never escape from the premise holding so much more promise than the story could deliver. Compared to other series in this genre, it struggled to hold its own candle. I feel bereft and let down after the promise and goodness that was Pandemonium. There are concepts and ideas there. A tale Oliver wants to tell about love \u2013 its strengths and pitfalls. The good and the bad. You can see the reaching for it in Requiem. Then a point comes when it seems the tale is abandoned in favour of wrapping it up as soon as possible. Some might call it an open ending. To me an open ending leaves you with thoughtful questions, not a whole lot of blank spaces. To me, Requiem doesn\u2019t have an open ending. It just stops, with little rhyme or reason. I\u2019m not even going to talk about anything else that happens or the characters or themes or writing or anything. I refuse. Debate or not, an ending is an ending is an ending. Just because something ended doesn\u2019t mean you gave it an actual ending. Need further proof?

Please Hold Oh, I'm sorry, were you expecting more? Crap. Let me think for a moment. There has to be something random that I can say. Does anyone remember my reference to the Book of Shhh in my review of book 2? Can anyone explain to me why it now appears to be a reworked Bible? I suppose the there were some previous book/chapter/verse descriptions which were similar to those in the Bible, but the reworked story of Solomon in Requiem where the baby actually gets sliced in two was HI-LA-RI-OUS disturbing. Requiem is told in two different alternating PoV's from both Lena and Hana. Even though I didn't read the short story of Hana (2.5), I'd probably go ahead and tell you to read it, or at the very least look up a wiki or have a friend spoil it for you like I did, so you get the gist of where Hana's mind is at now. Hana's story was eh? Lena's story was eh? The way everything collided at the end was eh? Can problems such as these be worked out with so little effort? The ending was (I guess) sort of okay, but also annoyingly open. This is all I can mention. How about we make a deal? For everyone who is reading this trilogy, come back and tell me what you thought of that ending. Maybe I'm overreacting and you will all love it. If you haven't started this trilogy, should you read it? Maybe. Book 1 was exciting. Book 2 was alright. Book 3 was not necessarily boring...it just all comes down to being anti-climactic for me. Maybe you won't feel the same. I have friends who enjoyed the entire trilogy. This isn't the worst dystopia I've read; that's for sure. Btw, this is going to be a t.v. show. So if you like reading books before seeing the story play out on film, then you'll be wanting to pick this up anyway. Sorry for the lame review. I can't get it right every time.

It's not horrible (Obviously, since I gave it five stars) but it took forever for the pace to pick up, for it to get interesting.

THE ENDING We are all aware that this is the last book. And being the last book, it needs to have a good ending. While the ending did leave a few questions unanswered (view spoiler) [The main question unanswered being Alex or Julian?!?!?! (hide spoiler) ] But I did like how it ended. It brought a sense that things are going to get better . (forgive me for being cliche but...)To me this is the best kind of ending. And while I am sad to see this series go... I will be very unhappy if this series continues, since I know when a book series needs to end (Cassandra Clare doesn't though. Sorry, had to get it out there) and after that ending, I know it is time for me to let this series go. Until the TV show premieres... Hopefully they won't ruin it... P.S.

Nothing and I mean a sum total of not a single thing, is actually resolved or completed or even just finished. I'm curious whether or not this was going to be the ending before this series was picked up for television. How can this series be just this, a love triangle that has a kind of sort of, but who knows, resolution, maybe? How could this happen? That is a serious question. I truly don\u2019t understand what happened. Let me just describe something that happened the other day and see how you feel. Okay, ready? \u201cSo, getting out of bed, looked out at the red-streaked sky, reminding me of the blood-shot eyes of my Uncle Morty who always smells of elderberries and turpentine when we would visit him down the Jersey shore where he has lived since retiring from his job at the pickle factory, went downstairs and had breakfast. Getting my bicycle with the red string on the handlebars so as not to confuse it with my best friend\u2019s identical bicycle that does not have string, I rode east to Jones Road, continuing south until I turned left onto Smith Boulevard where the houses start to look somewhat shabby. I went on until I came to a small alley between a boarded up chiropodist, no one cares for their feet these days, and a grocery. I went down the alley emerging on Adams Avenue where I once met a boy with freckles who smiled at me making me think of swimming in the warm waters of the bay with the salty spray splashing in my eyes and followed Adams until I finally turned west toward the better areas of town where the houses are bigger and better kept.\u201d Is that interesting? Or are you saying quit wasting my time and tell the story already? Well, that is the story, my bicycling trip. Wait, you thought it might be about the strange world I'm living in, my fight for survival? No, it is about where I go and how I get there, what streets I take and how I feel going there, how the air smells, how I enjoy the wind in my face, the bumpy or smooth pavement, the taste of the salt spray as I near the ocean, the creaking of the trees, the birdsong or lack of birdsong, my commentary on the housing. Is this off subject? NO. My point is that in this whole series there is tons of bicycling, walking, trudging through the woods/Wilds, driving(Hana) and just droning on and on about things that are so boring and add not one iota to the story. Do you really care what street she is on? Or how the houses look, for the fifteenth time? Or how the trudging in the woods today feels different from the trudging in the woods yesterday or last week? In fact, I\u2019d say that if all of that minutiae was removed or even mildly tightened, what you\u2019d have here would be one book instead of three. Please note, that I did not say one GOOD book, but just one book. Okay, back on track. I began this trilogy/misery because I read Before I Fall and thought Oliver had something special to her writing. Now, I just think she has wasted my time with this drivel about nothing more than a love triangle and not one that was EVER believable. I want characters who grow during the course of a story, whether a single book or a series. Growth. Change. Dare I say, even maturity. None of that happens here and, in my opinion, Lena becomes much less of an admirable person by the series end than in the beginning. Oh, is that the overall message? Love makes you into a selfish user? How sad. Her constant use of Julian to make herself feel better about Alex, how are we supposed to congratulate her for that? Oh, well done you, Lena. One of the things I liked the very least was that she spared no time or thought for Alex. Once he was caught she just walked/ran off. This guy gave his life for her, to save her, or so she believes,(She knows better, doesn\u2019t she? She knows her own mother was supposedly immediately executed but in reality survived many years in jail before escaping *Note: And why, exactly is she so pissed off at her mother? It isn\u2019t like she purposely went to jail or that she could have just come home to get Lena when she escaped.*)but she cannot even bother to try to find out if he is alive. I so hoped that the second book would be Lena coming into her own, investigating what happened to Alex, finding a way to free him or at least get a message to him that she is okay. But she leaves him behind like a sweaty pair of gym socks left on the bathroom floor. The third book I was longing to read about Alex and Lena being reunited after his escape(with or without her help) with some resolution to the situation. I would have loved to have some understanding along the way of why their world is at it is. It still makes not one jot of sense that love is outlawed and that the government, which it would seem is struggling to keep peace, feed, house and clothe its citizenry, would waste resources battling with those on the outside who have nothing. What I still don't understand is the reasoning behind love being outlawed. I mean, if you really wanted to solve the society/world's problems why not outlaw hate? If you could surgically alter the brain then why would you not get rid of hate? A world without hate = a much better place. And even putting that argument aside, how about just explaining at some point WHY this decision was made? Nothing in this world makes the first bit of sense. And, why would those who don't want to be cured be any kind of a threat to the government that they would waste time killing them? I mean, these people DON'T EVEN HAVE EATING UTENSILS!!! IF they can't even organize themselves enough to find some spoons, for gosh sakes, then they probably pose no threat to the government if left alone. Does this make any kind of sense at all? No, it really doesn't. I think I am the most disgusted with this series as I thought it held a lot of promise. Now, not so much. And the love triangle. Not for one single minute did I ever believe in the love between Julian and Lena. It never worked because it was so obvious he was nothing more than a stand-in, shoved at us in the second book. Yes, I did say shoved because it is so handy that Lena just happened to be conveniently imprisoned with Julian, the first not-gay or attached boy she's been alone with since leaving civilization. The depth of her feelings would seem to be oh, I'm here and he's here and what was the name of that guy who DIED FOR ME, the guy whom I can't even seem to remember that I liked or that he existed? Additionally, Lena never does anything that isn\u2019t in her own interest. She doesn\u2019t grow and care about the world around her. She cares about herself and what she needs. Perhaps that is human nature and that is what we all do, I don't know. She doesn\u2019t cling to Julian out of love for him or because he needs her, but because he makes her feel better over Alex. Blech. Until there is this epiphany, page 328: \"I will never love Julian like I love Alex.\" What a surprise. Didn't we know that all along? For gosh sakes, she is stupid, too stupid to realize that the boy who was willing to give up his life for her, who was shot while saving her, was imprisoned, was tortured , just might be a little bit irritated to see her show up all kissy-face with a new guy within months of losing him. And that this boy might then say something to hurt her, something like that he never loved her. Idiot. (view spoiler) [ And Julian gets the crap kicked out of himself because he attacks Alex , not the other way around, but does Lena get angry at Julian for beinng a hot-headed jerk. No, of course not. She lets loose on Alex, without ever knowing what he has been through and taking a moment to understand what being attacked might mean from his viewpoint. And let me say again, Julian attacked him. So Alex shouldn't have protected himself? (hide spoiler) ] During the big battle she isn\u2019t planning to help, but to go off and do what she wants. She doesn\u2019t consider if that action will be good for those involved or cause them harm, but it is what she wants. (view spoiler) [ And the moment when the battle is starting and Oliver must have simply gone \u201cEenie, meenie, miney, moe, which character should I kill here about which Lena can think about for the blink of an eye before she goes back to her own needs? And it had to be RAVEN??? All these others that we couldn't care less about, but she decides to do in Raven (view spoiler) [who, if you read the short story about her, was pregnant (hide spoiler) ] . Really? Why not off Coral who was ever just there for the romantic angst and served no other purpose? (hide spoiler) ] There are two perspectives to the story: Lena and Hana. The reason I almost gave this two stars instead of one is that, the two POVs, was a good idea. Hana's is actually the more interesting of the two, in my opinion, although I don't like Hana so tough to feel too sorry for her. Yep, I guessed what she had done waaaaaaaaaay back when. All in all, this series is a supreme waste of time and paper. I had high hopes for it, but was completely let down and I doubt I\u2019d be convinced to read this author again. Sorry this review is so rambling, but my disgust is so great that it was hard to organize my thoughts effectively. ...more ********Warning, spoilers for Pandemonium in passage below********* I'm gonna be blunt and put it out there.

My heart literally skipped like 5 beats when I read the ending of Pandemonium. It went pang, and it was like I saw his hair and heard his low voice. I guess I knew all along that Alex wasn't dead. It was a small, hopeful spark in my heart and when Julian came into the story I got kinda mad. I'm kinda attached to Alex, alright? All I can think about right now is the word \"Run\" that Alex said when he was caught. Not \"Save me\" but \"Run\". He sacrificed his life for her and didn't think once about himself. No wonder his eyes were all stony when he caught them kissing and making promises. Last of all, I cannot believe I have to wait another year for the third book. Lena better get back with Alex, or else. Julian can go marry Sarah or something. ...more 2.5 stars. I'm not sure I know what to say about this one. While I was only mildly impressed with Delirium , and found Lena to be a weak and indecisive character, I was incredibly impressed with her development in Pandemonium .

I found Requiem to be incredibly flat and boring, even with the many fighting scenes. They all seemed recycled, and took a backseat to Lena's dithering about the two boys. And the ending? The nicest word I have for it is abrupt. All in all, a disappointing conclusion to a promising series. (view spoiler) [Lena spent the entire story thinking about Alex. How she felt about him. How he might feel for her. How he felt for someone else. Meanwhile, she's still stringing Julian along, one minute running into his arms, the next emasculating him in front of their entire group. It was obvious she didn't respect Julian, and was using him to make Alex jealous, or to make herself feel better when Alex shunned her. And despite having maybe two actual conversations in the entire book, neither of which what you might call nice, when Alex says he still loves her that's it? That's the end of the whole story? The happy ending? We don't even get to see what happens with Julian, if he lives or dies? What happens with the Resistance? Nope. Alex and Lena are back together, so obviously everything's gonna be fine. (hide spoiler) ] ...more When I finished Pandemonium . . .

Random notes/thoughts: -In the first half Lena and the rest of the Invalids did nothing \u2014 they just plodded along in the Wilds arguing about what to do next. All they ended up doing was walking from one place to the next \u2014 it was boring. There was more action in the second half when Lena/the Invalids and the Resistance start to fight back \u2014 that was a bit more interesting. -Lena and Hana both took turns narrating. I did find their voices quite similar, which shouldn't have been the case 1. Because they were obviously two different characters and 2. Because Hana had the operation to more or less make her emotionless \u2014 so either Hana had too much emotion or Lena just had a robotic POV. Even though they sounded similar, Hana was more likeable. I didn't see what Hana's POV added to the overall story \u2014 it was just her monologuing about random stuff, getting ready for her wedding and being suspicious of her soon to be husband. It wasn't really needed \u2014 it didn't affect Lena's story or the big showdown at the end. -Not enough Lena/Alex scenes. -Lena was immensely unlikeable. She was vile \u2014 she's easily one of my most hated YA heroines ever. All she did was whine, feel sorry for herself and bitch about everyone and everything. She treated Julian awfully \u2014 if he was being nice to her she would complain, if he wasn't constantly up her arse she'd complain, if he volunteered to do something risky to prove himself she'd complain and if he helped the group she'd complain. She was a bitch. She was completely pathetic and petty when it came to Alex. Instead of fighting for him, she did nothing but whine about him not loving her. And then she'd use Julian to make him jealous \u2014 she was awful. She was a total cow to Coral - I wouldn't have minded her vile attitude if Coral had actually done something to deserve it but she hadn't. -I hated Alex too. I could get why he was angry but he still treated Lena like rubbish. She genuinely thought Alex was dead, that's the only reason she moved on. What did he want her to do, grieve for him for the rest of her life? It's obvious that she would never have been with Julian if she suspected he was alive. I found it dumb that he was moaning about Lena moving on yet he had no problem moving on with Coral straight away. He was a hypocrite. -The only characters that were likeable in the ridiculous love square were Julian and Coral - Lena and Alex selfishly used them so they could play games with each other. -The reunion between Lena and Annabel was rubbish. I wanted tears, pain, anger and years of bitterness but all I got was a small hissy fit and then nothing. They literally talked for a couple of minutes and then became best friends. I expected Lena to be angry for a long while but she got over her anger as soon as her mum gave her some half arse, lame non-explanation for abandoning her/not contacting her sooner. -The ending was lame. It literally stopped in a middle of a scene. There was no closure or answers. -Did Raven die? What was the point of making Raven pregnant in her novella when it wasn't bought up or even hinted at in Requiem . It seemed like the only reason Lauren Oliver made her pregnant was so her death could be tragic. Ugh. -The lame love triangle didn't have a satisfying conclusion. Sure, Lena said she loved Alex more than Julian but does that mean she dumped Julian for Alex? I wanted to see a break up scene and a proper reunion scene. -What happened to Rachel? Why didn't Annabel talk about helping Rachel? I know Rachel was cured but why would Annabel still abandon her and not think about her. It was weird. Annabel was a bitch \u2014 she just seemed to write off her daughters so she could play hero. -What happened to Jenny and Lena's aunt and uncle? -Was the rest of the world like America? -Did the Invalids and Resistance manage to take over Portland? Or were they beaten? What happened in the other cities? -What happened to Hana? Did her treatment fail? Does she just carry on walking around in her wedding dress for the rest of her life? -What happened to Julian? Wasn't he meant to be dying or something? If Lena dumps him, how does he cope? Just WTF. Either Lauren Oliver couldn't be bothered or she was trying to make the ending high brow and profound or some rubbish. She should have realised that she's writing books that revolve around lame world building, a crappy plot and teenage angst\u2026 Not to mention the fact that at least half of her readers were only reading for the love triangle. She's not writing some thought provoking literary masterpiece that's left open ended and mysterious because it suits the theme of book\u2026 Nope, she's writing a YA series that's main focus is arguably the love triangle. The least she could have done was give a satisfying resolution to the Alex/Lean/Julian drama. For shame, Lauren Oliver. For shame. ...more Well, I really want this book. Really badly. Really badly.

Julian didnt hae that option, he went into that room with the certainty that he would die, and he was willing to die so that he could keep his memories of him and Lena. I was acually kinda gutted when Alex turned up coz now shes going to be all conflicted and crap. When i was reading Delirium Alex didnt melt me the way that Julian did in Pandemonium. I absoultly love how clueless Julian is and yet he still follows Lena blindly ... just like Lena did with Alex. And now that Alex has been all screwed up by the Crypts I dont think he is going to be very nice. I think Lena deserves the safe bet who makes her feel good about herself after everything she has been through and that safe bet is Julian. End Of.

First of all, I have to admit that I find this a genuinely authentic theme for a dystopian trilogy. Some readers may consider it obscenely absurd. Idiotic. Daft. Pick one. Not me. It's actually very clever. Can you honestly guarantee that with the rate things are going, something like this would be impossible to occur? I mean, hear this humanity. If dividing mankind into pre-determined factions to avoid social inconsistencies and emotional fallouts, or throwing together kids in a bloodthirsty arena competition to the death to \"teach a lesson\" to the disobedient lot does not work out, why not do something like this? Why not perform one simple surgery to subdue all feelings of love, compassion, friendship and create one big family of catatonic coach potatoes? There goes your next plan, world. For me this particular lay-out of the plot worked perfectly. The heroine, Lena , really seems to grasp the seriousness of the situation. My mouth is so dry; the sun is so blinding. I look away, toward the hundreds and hundreds of people who have been driven out of their homes, out of their lives, to this place of dust and dirtiness, all because they wanted the power to feel, to think, to choose for themselves. They couldn\u2019t have known that even this was a lie\u2014that we never really choose, not entirely. We are always being pushed and squeezed down one road or another. We have no choice but to step forward, and then step forward again, and then step forward again; suddenly we find ourselves on a road we haven\u2019t chosen at all. But maybe happiness isn\u2019t in the choosing. Maybe it\u2019s in the fiction, in the pretending: that wherever we have ended up is where we intended to be all along. But the thing is that, the two previous books built on the fact that this whole resistance, this whole rebellion, had one objective. Being able to choose. To love. And not just love a partner or a husband and a wife. But to love a son, or a daughter, a mother, a sister and so on. People were being persecuted for showing sympathies towards their own kids. So, where is this element of love in this final book? There is this one love interest, Alex , who is in love with Lena but I just can't see it almost anywhere, and there is this other love interest, Julian , whose love I can see and who ends up alone after choosing to leave behind everything he knew his entire life to chase the freedom of making his own choices. So I'm left feeling like: Because the book has ended, and most importantly the trilogy has ended, and I'm thinking: Thankfully, the final words somewhat salvage it. Take down the walls. That is, after all, the whole point. You do not know what will happen if you take down the walls; you cannot see through to the other side, don\u2019t know whether it will bring freedom or ruin, resolution or chaos. It might be paradise or destruction. Take down the walls. Otherwise you must live closely, in fear, building barricades against the unknown, saying prayers against the darkness, speaking verse of terror and tightness. Otherwise you may never know hell; but you will not find heaven, either. You will not know fresh air and flying. I guess that's it. ...more I'm so angry right now, I don't even know what to say.

Love this world, loved where it was going, but I don't feel any closure, which has left me feeling less enthused with the series as a whole. SO DISAPPOINTED I love Lauren Oliver's writing, but I feel that Pandemonium deserved to be followed with something better--something less rushed. It's the curse of the third and final book. I hated Mockingjay because it was so rushed (like, oh, it's the final book, let's get it over with). I thought Lauren wouldn't let that happen...but I feel it did. Requiem was rushed and left me unsatisfied. This series WAS my favorite...but this ruined it. Still love the first two books. Ok so I found this book to be my second favorite in the series. I still love the first one because, well it HAS Alex in it. The ending wasn't as big or good as I hoped it would be, I hated Julian and I was more than happy when he was kinda shoved out of Lena's heart in the end, but she still wasn't sure who to pick. *cough* Alex *cough*.

This is one of my favorite love stories because it actually opened my eyes and showed me what love really means, that it's just not another feeling or word we coexist next to every day. So I wanna talk about the ending. I feel like Oliver was actually trying to convey a meaning in the way her series ended even though it left us confused. Here is my idea: In the moment, we don\u2019t know where our lives will lead us and we don\u2019t know how things could change tomorrow. But when you\u2019re at a good place, you just have to revel in that moment and let everything come as it may. None the less I think it was still good but the first book: Delirium will ALWAYS be my favorite.(: ...more", "Title": "Requiem"},
