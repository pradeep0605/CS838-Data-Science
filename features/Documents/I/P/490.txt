I was looking for a new bedtime book to read to my children - 2 and 6 at the time. We like to read a bigger book, one chapter each night - for bedtime stories. I read the description and thought it sounded like a good idea so I went ahead and bought it (which is REALLY unusual for me - I can be a cheapskate!) It is by far some of the best money I have ever spent.<---F> The book is really that good</---F>. While technically a children's story, I could have read this as an adult before I had kids and loved the book just as much - it is a story that is so beautiful, classic and timeless. The thing I think I love the most about her writing style is that she does NOT dumb anything down. Not the language, characters, plot, theme or anything. The style is like a story teller telling you the story, with some asides and speaking to the reader. Which added so much to the story. The book is paced perfectly (there were many nights we all wanted to just keep reading and reading!), and the chapters are perfect breaking points (I would not be surprised at all to find out that she purposefully chose the chapter breaks with nightly reading in mind - there is a wonder cliff hanger feel to each chapter ending. Every night my son would look at me with big eyes and say - I wonder what is going to happen next??!!) The themes are very complex, but everything is understandable even to young children (my 2 year old daughter was able to follow along without too much difficulty - but with a lot of word definitions!) I liked that it dealt with such big themes like duty and love and heartache and redemption and the reality of the world around you. (ie certain characters are not evil but mean, sometimes people do stupid things that you can't fix, etc.) I could go on all day about things that I loved and scenes that were so wonderful i can still see them in my head. We have read this as a family for bedtime stories 3 times now!! And given the chapter a night pace and the size of the book, that is no small feat! This is a book that I will save and give to my grandchildren. I can't recommend it enough!! Also check out The Journey of Edward Tulane - we loved Despereaux more, but it is a very close call. That book is very similar and also wonderful. ...more OK, so now that I've thought about what I really think about this book, I'm changing my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars. There was more that I didn't like than I liked. After hearing a lot good reports about this book, I think I was expecting something different. I liked the idea of the light versus dark. I liked the unlikely friendship between the mouse and the princess. I liked the forgiveness. And I liked that it ended up \"happily ever after\", for the most part.

I started out reading this book aloud to my boys, but I stopped reading to them after the first rat chapter and finished the book myself,<---M> then gave them the condensed version</---M>, picking up with the actual reading at the very end of the book. They were disturbed (and so was I) by the unfeeling evil of the rats. I felt even worse about the constant ear boxing and degredation of Miggery Sow. I didn't go for another princess story without a mom. Just like all the Disney movies - Mom is deceased and Dad is oblivious. And what about the mouse family? Yikes! I didn't like that the darkness in the story seemed to outweigh the light. The rat and Miggery Sow chapters were simply unpleasant. The lack of positive family feelings was sad. And what is this about Miggery Sow and a big kitchen knife? Hmm. I guess I was anticipating more light. More love. More happy family feelings. I realize that the negative was essential to make the contrast between light and dark, but for me, there was just too much dark and not enough light. Especially for a prize winning book geared for young people. ...more I remember reading books like this or having them read to me as a kid.

Until one day, w Seeing the Light (A Book Review of Kate DiCamillo\u2019s The Tale of Desperaux ) Despereaux Tilling is the most unusual mouse you\u2019lll likely meet. Conspicously small with considerable large ears, he has always been seen as different, an outsider among his own \u2014 a mouse drawn to music, fascinated with stories, and breaks the strict rule of their kind by falling in love with a human, the Princess Pea. Roscuro leads a normal, rotten rat life in the dungeon, his is a world of utter darkness. Until one day, when a match was lit in front of his face and he ventures upstairs in the castle, he began to crave nothing but the color and light that he is denied, and and so vows to make others miserable, plunging them to the gloom which he is subjected. Miggery Sow, \u201cnamed after his fahter\u2019s favorite prize-winning pig,\u201d lost her mother when she was young. Her father abandoned and sold her away to an old man who boxed the girl\u2019s ear until she became hard of hearing. Finally, on a fateful stroke of fortune, she came to the castle where she proved to be a slow-witted servant. But Mig has aspirations: she has seen the Princess and wants to become her. These unique assortment of characters will set out to an adventure and stumble into each others lives in Kate DiCamillo\u2019s 2004 Newbery award-winning novel, <+++>The Tale of Despereaux</+++> . For a long time I\u2019ve looking for a children\u2019s book that I will flat out love and this book has got to be it! Beautifully told by a narrator that directly speaks to the reader, it has a delicate magic about it that holds the yours attention from start to finish, spellbound by the unfolding story page after page, seize by its peculiar storyline that jumps backwards and forwards into certain events in the tale that leaves you anticipating for what\u2019s going to happen next. Kate DiCamillo\u2019s voice,trimmed with wit and wisdom, is wildly authorative \u2014 asking us questions; showing us a thing or two about what is disappointment, grief, prejudice, and forgiveness; sometimes instructing the reader to look up a particular word in the dictionary and pointing us about the consequences of certain actions \u2014 while at the same over the top, funny, and confiding yet in a manner that doesn\u2019t feel intrusive, talks down to its reader or break the story\u2019s pace. It\u2019s a wondeful storyteller\u2019s voice that makes every word beg to be read aloud. Timothy Basil Ering\u2019s sprightly illustrations add more dimension to its quirky characters and takes the reader a step beyond the world of Despereaux. The book\u2019s lovely design gives this fairy tale a mythic feel that contributes to its over all enjoyment. Over and above, what makes The Tale of Despereaux truly remarkable is that it boldly tackles weighty themes that regular children\u2019s books would have avoided. Given that this is a fairy tale with talking animals as its characters, Kate DiCamillo dares to raise topics that are too close for comfort. She doesn\u2019t shy away from or sugar-cost the darker aspects of her story by bringing to the fore subjects such as cruelties one can do to harm or hurt others, violence, child abuse and \u2014 the most awful of the lot \u2014 parental abandonment. Through Despereaux\u2019s story we see the pains of being different and his search for love and acceptance, things that are not often freely given, sadly sometimes, by those who belong in our primal relationship or even by those who are close to us. Dealing with these raw emotions in a way makes me feel that it may not appeal to some readers, notable of which are parents who are cautious with what their children are reading and I at one see that this might not be an ideal bedtime story reading. But well-meaning parents please do check this one out! Far from being gloomy, The Tale of Despereax is a book that celebrates courage in believing in yourself, honor, redemption, kindness, compassion and forgiveness. As a full-bodied soup, it warms and comforts the heart. As an entr\u00e9e, the author serves up a satisfying meal in the grand tradition of the Grimm Brother\u2019s fairy tales yet with distinction all its own and a balanced treatment of its main ingridient, the darkness and light, each equally important but with a decided appreciation towards the latter for just as the author declares \u201cStories are light.\u201d Yes, I believe this story illuminates and will be cherieshed by children and child-at-hearts. It shines on. And how did it end you ask? It may not end up in the way they exactly wished for, as dreams aren\u2019t realized in the way one hopes it to be. Still one can create it in a way it is need and can be achieved in more ways than one which goes to say that yes, Gentle Reader, each character deserves their own happily ever after. _________________________ Book Details: Book #9 for 2011 Published by Candlewick Press (Hardcover, First Edition 2003) 270 pages Started: March 27, 2011 Finished: March 27, 2011 My Rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 [See this book review on my book blog Dark Chest of Wonders and for many others.] ...more I never knew this was a book.

I just stumbled across the title while browsing at my favorite online used book seller one day and thought 'Oh, I have to get this!' And the book was every bit as wonderful as the movie. Actually better, because I loved the way DiCamillo would address remarks directly to the Reader every so often. We are told to go look up the word perfidy in the dictionary. We are told to say the word quest out loud. It is an extraordinary word, isn't it? So small and yet so full of wonder, so full of hope. And we are reminded of realities: Reader, you must know that an interesting fate (sometimes involving rats, sometimes not) awaits almost everyone, mouse or man, who does not conform. Oh, speaking of rats: Rats have a sense of humor. Rats, in fact, think that life is very funny. And they are right, reader. They are right. Our hero Despereaux does not conform. He did not fit into Mouse World from the day he was born. He had to learn to be himself. And his fate did involve rats, but it also involved love, hope, light, and of course soup. Despereaux is supposed to eat the glue and pages of the books in the castle library, but instead he discovers that he can read, and he reads a story of a knight who rescues a princess. This story gives him the idea that will eventually be both his undoing and his salvation. There is a Princess, who is not used to being told what to do. And there is a peasant girl is is not used to anything other than being told what to do. And getting clouted on the ear. I felt very sorry for this girl, named Miggery Sow. Her father sold her for a red blanket, a chicken, and a handful of cigarettes. She sees the Princess ride by one day and decides then that she wants to be a Princess too. But the world does not care what poor Mig wants. She is taken at one point from the man who bought her, put to work in the castle and eventually plays her part in Despereaux's quest. Parts of the story were a little puzzling to me. Did Mig really have to get clouted on the ear so much? Was it necessary to have her (and later the King) described as not the sharpest knife in the drawer ? This bit troubled me a little, but overall the book is fun, and would be great to read aloud. ...more This book left me with the feeling that this story may not appeal to all readers. There were several important themes addressed in the story, yet little emotional attachment to the characters. The only character that many might relate to is Despereaux himself.

He is \u2018different\u2019 both physically and emotionally from his peers which at first mostly works against him, though ultimately these unique qualities eventually save the day. I did really appreciate the way this author drew in the reader in a direct manner, literally addressing the reader in the story as if the author and reader are in this together. The author almost forces the reader to actively acknowledge the examples of forgiveness, the pain of being different, grief, prejudice, cruelty not only between natural enemies but also cruelty in those primary relationships with those who are supposed to love us, i.e., parents. There are also examples of compassion as shown by the princess, the cook, and a mouse. One important concept was present throughout the story. Light is good and darkness is evil. Striving for light (and music) represents hope and all that is worth striving for. Even the evil rat wants this light in the form of possessing the princess. The dungeon, or darkness, is scary, dirty, confusing, and cruel. Death resides in the darkness. The message is clear, i.e., keep heading for the light. I am glad the author did not end the story with a flip \u2018happily ever after\u2019 tone. Instead she showed how someone may not achieve exactly what they\u2019d wished for, yet can still create a satisfactory life. Perhaps cutting off a mouse tail, hitting a girl until she is deaf, abandoning a child to a male predator, and images of being murdered by a disgusting rat left me feeling a tad raw. I certainly do realize there are children who are treated terribly in our real world, but I struggle to believe that any child would particular want to read about it. ...more Um, I really disliked this book. I read it aloud with my #3 and feel like a bad parent for doing so. Poor Miggery Sow- named after a pig, motherless, traded for next to nothing, abused, and then later described as lazy and fat. Crikey. And then there was the author's penchant for describing things to the \"Reader\" as an aside.

Lama sudah nongkrong di rak buku, akhirnya saya baca karena pingin bacaan yang lebih ringan dan bisa lekas diselesaikan. Apa yang dikatakan oleh Anthony de Mello, SJ bahwa orang dapat menolak nasihat, tetapi tidak bisa menolak cerita, itu terbukti. Cerita tentang kastil dan kehidupannya. Tentang tikus kastil, keluarga dan komunitas tikus kastil, Raja Philip dan keluarganya, komunitas tikus got, serta sipir dan tahanan bawah tanah kastil Raja Philip. Cerita ini sarat dengan nilai. Setiap tokoh mempunyai karakter yang unik. Mari kita lihat satu-satu. 1. Desperaux, si tokoh utama. Ia adalah tikus kastil yang tidak diharapkan kelahirannya. Telinganya besar dan sering sakit flu. Ia memiliki kepekaan seni yang tinggi. Ia menyukai musik, tidak seperti saudara dan saudarinya yang suka menggigit buku tua di kastil, Desperaux malah suka membaca buku, dan ia sangat tertarik pada kecantikan Putri Pea. 2. Chiaroscuro. Ia adalah tikus got namun ia lebih suka cahaya terang dibanding gelapnya got. Suatu saat ketika pesta jamuan makan, ia mengagumi lampu yang ada di ruang makan, hingga ia memanjatnya. Namun, ia terjatuh dari lampu itu dan masuk ke dalam masakan istana. Ia suka lampu, tapi benci dengan Putri Pea. 3. Migery Sow. Seorang anak perempuan yang dijual oleh ayahnya. Ia terobsesi menjadi putri. 4.Botticelli Remorso. Seekor tikus got yang jahat. Ia membawa Desperaux kepada putri Pea, namun Remorso berniat jahat untuk membunuh Sang Putri. 5. Gregory the Jailor. Seorang sipir penjara 6. Furlough Tilling. Saudara laki-laki Despreaux. Ia salah satu tikus yang menjebloskan Desperaux ke penjara bawah tanah. 7. Lester Tilling. Saudara perempuan Desperaux. Ia mengajari Desperaux untuk menggigit kertas. 8. Antoinette Tilling. Ibu Desperaux, yang merasa kecewa karena melahirkan banyak anak tikus membuat kecantikannya. Cerita dalam buku ini bukan berurutan secara kronologis, ada tiga kisah yang terpisah namun ke satu muara. Kisah itu dibawakan oleh narator yang menyapa pembaca dengan kata \"nak\", walaupun kisah ini bukan hanya ditujukan buat anak-anak. Setiap kisah yang berbeda itu mempunyai pesan tersendiri. Kisah ini diawali dengan kelahiran anak tikus yang baru, yaitu Desperaux. Fisik Desperaux berbeda dengan saudara-saudaranya. Telinganya lebar, dan ia suka sakit-sakitan. Kemana-mana ia membawa saputangan sebab ia suka bersin. Baik ayah, ibu, paman, dan saudaranya hanya melihat \"kekurangan\" Desperaux. Antara lain, ia tidak bisa berlari seperti tikus kastil lainnya, tidak suka makan kertas. Namun diantara semua kekurangannya itu, dosa terbesarnya menurut kaum tikus kastil adalah Desperaux berbicara kepada manusia. Menurut \"standar hidup\" tikus kastil, menampakkan diri di hadapan manusia adalah tabu apalagi hingga berbicara dengan manusia. Itu terjadi karena Desperaux terpesona mendengarkan permainan gitar Raja Philip kemudian mendekat ke ruang raja, saat itu ia juga terpesona dengan kecantikan Putri Pea dan Desperaux jatuh cinta padanya. keberadaannya di ruang raja itu diketahui oleh tikus kastil yang lain. Desperaux dibawa ke pengadilan tikus kastil dan ia dihukum ke penjara bawah tanah kastil. Pada saat yang berbeda, diceritakan bahwa ada seorang anak perempuan yang sedang menuju kastil. Kisah hidupnya sangat menyedihkan. Namanya Migery Sow. Saat masih berusia 7 tahun ia dijual oleh ayahnya. Ibunya sudah meninggal. Ia dijual kepada tukang panci yang ia sebut paman. Ia sering dijewer sampai telinganya seperti bunga kol. Impiannya adalah menjadi Putri sebab ia pernah melihat keluarga Raja Philip bersama Ratu dan Putri Pea berjalan-jalan, Migery Sow merasa hal itu hilang dari hidupnya. Di istana, Putri Pea juga merasa kehilangan karena ibunya meninggal. Sang ratu sangat menyukai sup. Ratu terkejut setengah mati ketika melihat ada tikus got di sup kerajaaan. Tikus got itu adalah Roscuro. Bagaimana Roscuro masuk ke panci sup ratu? Roscuro terjatuh dari lampu hias, ia sangat mengagumi cahaya lampu, hingga ia memanjatnya. Namun Putri Pea melihatnya, dan berteriak. Saat itulah Roscuro terjatuh dan tercebur dalam panci sup. Ratu meninggal karena sup kesukaannya \"tercemar\" tikus got. Raja Philip marah. Ia memerintahkan semua sup di negeri itu dilarang, menyita sendok dan panci, dan semua tikus got harus dimusnahkan. Ketiga kisah memperlihatkan peran orangtua dalam mendidik anak. Orangtua Desperaux tidak membela anaknya di depan pengadilan tikus kastil; Migery Snow harus kehilangan kasih sayang orangtua tunggalnya dari sejak anak-anak; Raja Philip yang \"kalap\" melarang sup, sendok,panci dan membunuh tikus got.

Sila bagi orangtua yang ingin memberi bacaan dan tontonan bagus buat anak-anaknya, dan siap-siap ditanyain: kenapa ada orang terlahir kaya seperti Putri Pea sementara ada yang miskin? kenapa ada yang suka makan sup? kenapa ada orang yang suka bunuh tikus? pasti disuruh Raja Philip :) @hws16042011 ...more Two words to describe The Tale of Despereaux : sweet and heartwarming .

Despereaux Tilling is born small, but with huge ears. He is, however, no ordinary mouse, for he can read, he loves stories and music, and he eventually falls in love with pretty Princess Pea. Chiaroscuro, or Roscuro, is a rat who lives in the dungeon, but who longs for light, and seeks to thrive in it. Miggery Sow is a slow-witted little girl who was sold by her father for a red tablecloth and other sundry, to a man who made her his serving girl and gave her cauliflower ears for all the clouting he did. Their paths inevitably cross in a story of forgiveness, compassion, sacrifice, and yes, soup . The sweet part lies in the fact that Despereaux fell in love with a princess, and in his daydreams about defending and rescuing her, and in his efforts to prove how much he loved her. The heartwarming part is in the forgivenesses and sacrifices all around, and the fact that despite the three characters' shared attribute of being the odd man out among their peers, they would eventually find their happiness, and become content. This is the first book I've read with a narrative that addresses the reader directly: \"But, reader, there is no comfort in the word 'farewell', even if you say it in French. 'Farewell' is a word that, in any language, is full of sorrow. It is a word that promises absolutely nothing\" or \"Reader, nothing is sweeter in this sad world than the sound of someone you love calling your name. Nothing.\" I thought it was a cute and fun way to narrate a story, and very effective, too.

At times, the writing strains uncomfortably, as if the author was trying to hit a home run, but had to settle for a double. As if by sheer effort, she could make this book into a \"classic\", without first earning the affection of the readers. Skip it, I say.

She may like death and disappoint a lot, but, I for one am glad it's out there for kids to read. I think parents (or the ones that shop here, anyway), sometimes want to (over)protect and forget that we learn just as much, if not more, from a book with both ends of the spectrum. \"Everything, as you well know (having lived in this world long enough to have figured out a thing or two for yourself), cannot always be sweetness and light.\" (pg 183) I really like the narrator. I like the questions she asks, I (\"Reader, do you think that it is a terrible thing to hope when there is really no reason to hope at all? Or is it (as the soldier said about happiness) something that you might just as well do, since, in the end, it really makes no difference to anyone but you ?\"), I like that she forces a dictionary on you (\"Reader, do you know what the word 'perfidy' means? I have a feeling you do, based on the little scene that just unfolded here. But you should look up the word in your dictionary, just to be sure.\"), and I really love it when she encourages you to say the word \"quest\" out loud.

Inconceivably, DiCamillo spends the majority of the book writing about deaf serving girl Miggery Sow and the evil rat, Roscuro and not our hero mouse\u2014something you would not expect in a book titled: The Tale of Despereaux . In fact in just a few minutes I have gone to the living room bookcase and grabbed Alex Haley\u2019s Roots , To Kill a Mockingbird , Fifty Shades of Grey , and the Merriam-Webster Dictionary and they all contain more action concerning tiny mice with large ears named Despereaux then DiCamillo\u2019s book. Gor! The running gag of striking Miggery Sow, (a young girl) in the ear (she ultimately goes deaf\u2014ha?) made me uncomfortable and the ending showdown between mouse-knight and rats was anticlimactic and disappointing on so many levels. On a positive note, my son says he did enjoy it and wants to see the movie, but I feel perhaps he saw how excited I was to read this and didn\u2019t want to disappoint me. ...more I love this book! I love, love, love this book! Which is something, because I don't typically love, love, love books and most certainly not books about mice. And I'm not a big reader of fantasy/fairy tales But this book: this book I LOVE! I read the first few chapters of this book several times before actually reading it. I'd see it in the library (where I work) or at home (waiting to be read) or in a teachers classroom and I always felt compelled to re-read the beginning purely for the enjoyment I love this book!

(The only other book that has had this effect on me is \"If on A Winters Night by Calvino). This book makes me want to be in the classroom again. I loved the dramatic tone created by the \"Dear Reader\" moments, I thought the balance of what was said and unsaid was perfect (I felt like hugging Kate DiCamillo after reading this ending to a chapter, \"He had expected Cook to kill him. Instead, reader, she had laughed at him. And he was surprised how much her laughter hurt\"). I loved that there were happy AND unhappy endings. oh and the Rats heart that didn't mend properly - I love that. did I mention I love this book yet? ...more I saw the upcoming movie previews and thought I should read the book. This edition is a slim volume with ragged edged paper and lovely charcoal illlustrations. It certainly is an original work. Young Despereaux is the youngest mouse, born of a french mouse mother and father. He is the runt, small and undersized with big ears. He was born with his \"eyes wide open\". These ears allow him to hear things other mice don't hear and his eyes observes things other mice don't see.

Like the works of the late Roald Dahl and many classic fairy tales, this story includes scenes of parental abandonment and cruelty (Hansel & Gretel, Matilda) and nightmare fantasy (being alone and lost in a maze-like dark dungeon) What is unique is the voice of the narrator. This is a story meant to be read aloud. The narrator asks the reader questions throughout the tale. It reminds me of the very best children's librarians whose delightful way of reading a story, and engaging their young listeners in \"story hour\", have given all of us such fond memories and contributed to our lifelong love of books. ...more I was thinking the other day: what would you do if you had a negative (and I mean really negative) opinion on a book but by chance happened to come across its author? What would you tell them if they asked you what you thought about their book? Without the luxury of the internet or reviews or all the other ways we have of expressing a negative opinion on things without having to come into direct contact with their creator, we tend to be more insensitive with our criticism. The medium is the mess I was thinking the other day: what would you do if you had a negative (and I mean really negative) opinion on a book but by chance happened to come across its author?

Without the luxury of the internet or reviews or all the other ways we have of expressing a negative opinion on things without having to come into direct contact with their creator, we tend to be more insensitive with our criticism. The medium is the message ... What is the message the medium of criticism conveys? That, perhaps, individual works of art can be analysed, praised or attacked as if they existed in a void - as if they weren't created by people with flaws and feelings. I understand that criticism is necessary in a world as saturated with works of art as the one we live in, if only for us to be able to timidly navigate through this ever-expanding sea of creativity. However, I also believe it's necessary to look at established institutions a little more, ahem, critically from time to time. So: should we be writing criticism we wouldn't be able to say it to the authors' faces? I'll let you ponder that a for a sec. ... Done? Great! At this point I'll contradict myself, as I so happily and readily do, and say what I can say from the safety and isolation of my Goodreads account, albeit signed with my real name, a move I would predictably not make if I knew my review would be read by Kate DiCamillo and not get lost in the ego-stroking labyrinth of positive comments and reviews this piece of work has disappointingly received. This, people, is one of the worst books I've ever read. Terribly obnoxious, annoying, arbitrary characters; events I did not care about reading and that made me feel worse than before (what was up with the cauliflower ears? Come on! ); an arrogant, didactic style of writing that's pretending not to be so but which cannot help but seep through... I'd go on but it's already been a couple of months since I read it so most of my vitriol has evaporated; that is, I can't really remember more of the exact reasons I didn't enjoy this book at all, but what I can tell you is that it managed to solidify itself in my memory as a bad reading experience, one that made me feel uncomfortable, a kind of uncanny sick inside. Maria did warn me, but I just had to sneak a peek at this train wreck... To not make this review longer than it should be, I'll just say that I'd never read this to my child. At least it had beautiful illustrations. ...more A talking mouse falls in love with a beautiful princess, and, armed with only a needle, vows to rescue her from the clutches of an evil rat and a dull servant-girl. Admittedly, it sounds a bit (okay, very) trite. That was my mindset too, even after the librarian had gushed on and on about what a wonderful book it was (did she think I was going to read some LITTLE KIDS' fairytale?).

But two years ago, I was waiting backstage during a piano concert, bored out of my mind, when I found The Tale of Despereaux lying on a table. What I was thinking as I picked it up was something like \"Well, it's better than nothing.\" What I actually found was one of the most beautiful stories I have ever read. A simple, heart-breaking tale of love, soup, light, and impossible hopes and dreams. So, you see, don't judge a book by its cover (or in this case, its summary). Who knows what you might miss? ...more If somebody had tried to tell me a month ago that one of my favourite books read in 2012 would have a little mouse as its protagonist, I would have laughed. I am not big on anthropomorphic characters. I mean, except cats that appear as characters. Those I love but mice and other talking things? Yeah, no, not my thing at all. However, Despereaux calls to mind something warm, something soft, defenseless. Like one of those pictures of kittens that are so plentiful on tumblr. How do you resist? Anywa If somebody had tried to tell me a month ago that one of my favourite books read in 2012 would have a little mouse as its protagonist, I would have laughed.

However, Despereaux calls to mind something warm, something soft, defenseless. Like one of those pictures of kittens that are so plentiful on tumblr. How do you resist? Anyway, the story itself is so heartwarming, so unassuming and so guileless that I couldn\u2019t help but be swept away by the heroic quest of one of the least heroic characters I have ever come across in my reading career. Knowing that it is impossible for him and attempting to rescue the princess anyway? That is courage, people. No matter how flashy and beautiful The Invention of Hugo Cabret may have been, I think The Tale of Despereaux wins simply on account of how beautiful the story is. No, no one has been comparing the two, it\u2019s just me. I urge you to read this for yourself and if you have a child in your life, read it out loud to them. Watch the wonder in their eyes as they follow the adventures of one poor mouse who is condemned at birth and who even loses his tail. Watch them react to the horrible rats, especially the irascible villain of the piece who walks around with a spoon as a hat. This is a beautiful book, a classic really, and should find a home on your shelf in all its illustrated glory. Strongly recommended. ...more Just started this two hours ago for the Bibliothon & finished it in one sitting. It's such a cute and entertaining read.

Jangan melakukan atau mengatakan hal2 yang menyakitkan hati orang lain, karena kita tidak tau dengan cara apa hatinya akan menyembuhkan diri, seperti yang terjadi pada Roscuro. - Dengarkan dan pedulikan apa keinginan anak, jika tidak ingin anak kita tumbuh seperti Miggery. - Bahwa kehilangan seseorang yang dicintai bisa membuat seseorang melakukan sesuatu yang tidak masuk akal spt sang Raja. Tapi rasa duka itu nantinya juga akan berakhir. - Bahwa cinta itu indah, kadang juga konyol, seperti cinta Despereaux pada Putri Pea. Tapi kekuatan cinta sungguh menakjubkan. Ini kisah tentang tikus kastil bernama Despereaux. Yang berbeda dari saudara2nya dan tikus kastil lainnya. Yang badannya terlalu kecil dan telinganya terlalu besar. Yang tidak suka mencari remah2, tidak suka menggerogoti kertas dan tidak mau belajar seni lari terbirit2. Yang anehnya suka pada musik dan suka membaca tulisan di atas kertas. Yang dengan beraninya duduk di kaki Raja dan mau disentuh oleh Putri Pea. Yang dengan konyolnya merasa jatuh cinta pada Putri Pea. Yang akhirnya harus menjalani hukuman di ruang bawah tanah. Karena Despereaux berbeda. Ini kisah tentang tikus got bernama Roscuro. Yang hidup bersama komunitasnya di kegelapan ruang tahanan bawah tanah. Yang terobsesi pada cahaya, tidak seperti tikus got lainnya. Yang dengan nekatnya muncul di kastil yang tengah berpesta dan bergelantungan di lampu istana. Yang karena terkejut jatuh ke dalam mangkuk sup Ratu. Yang kemudian diteriaki dan dipandang penuh jijik oleh Putri Pea karena ia seekor tikus got. Hati Roscuro terluka. Hati yang hancur itu menemukan caranya sendiri untuk sembuh. Membalas dendam pada Putri Pea. Karena hati Roscuro terluka. Ini kisah tentang Miggery. Yang ibunya telah meninggal dunia. Yang dijual oleh ayahnya demi sebungkus rokok, selembar taplak merah dan seekor ayam. Yang setiap hari dijewer oleh ayah angkatnya. Yang bercita-cita ingin menjadi putri di istana. Yang akhirnya menjadi pelayan Putri Pea, namun msh menyimpan harapan untuk menjadi seorang putri. Tapi siapa yang peduli? Karena seumur hidupnya, tidak pernah ada yang peduli pada keinginan Miggery. Ini juga kisah tentang semangkuk sup. Yang merupakan masakan favorit Ratu. Yang menyebabkan Ratu meninggal karena dari dalamnya muncul seekor tikus got bernama Roscuro. Yang akhirnya menjadi masakan terlarang di seluruh negeri, atas titah sang Raja yang berduka. Karena Raja sangat kehilangan orang yang dicintainya. Ini juga kisah tentang segulung benang merah. Yang digantungkan di leher setiap tikus tahanan, termasuk Despereaux. Yang pada akhirnya membantu Despereaux untuk menjalankan misi ksatrianya. Karena cinta Despereaux pada Putri Pea. Kisah sederhana khas cerita anak2. Jelas antara hitam dan putih. Nyata bahwa pada akhirnya kebaikan akan mengalahkan keburukan. Penuh dengan pesan moral.

I thought it was tremendously boring. I'm all for taking the tradition of fairy tales and changing them around, but this didn't work for me. First of all, it was very dark (sometimes literally, as a theme of darkness versus light pervaded the text). There were villains at every turn, and rather scary ones at that. The book suggests that most people are evil--very, very evil--especially to their own children. One example of this is when Despereaux's father sends him to his death; another is when Miggery's father trades her for a tablecloth. Both fathers eventually feel bad for what they did, but it makes for a frightening and disturbing story. I started to care about Despereaux and his quest, but then he left the narrative for most of the middle and it was about Miggery, who was unpleasant and not sympathetic. I don't like the way DiCamillo wrote Miggery at all. She was abused, which started to get my sympathy, but then she had no redeeming qualities. She wanted to be a princess, but it seemed like that was more for comedy than anything. It seems like DiCamillo went out of her way to make Miggery as stereotypically UN-princesslike as possible: fat, ugly, stupid, mean. I also felt like DiCamillo made fun of her hearing trouble, which I didn't like at all. I'm not exactly sure how this was award-winning, or what made it worthy of its awards. I also don't really know who the intended audience is, because the fairy tale around a mouse part seems very juvenile, but the themes are older, and there's some tough vocabulary, too. If I were a 6th grader, I would be embarrassed to be seen reading a fairy tale book like this, but I guess my kids don't mind. If you're a sixth grader reading this review and you liked The Tale of Despereaux , defend it to me! Make me change my mind! ...more Such a charming book. I read it alongside with my daughter, and found it inspiring for it contains many different topics to further discussion. It does have a bit of too much light/dark and good/bad, but in the end DiCamillo does a great job to show that it is not always black and white (or dark and light).

I would not try it with kids that are too young since it does have scary parts and meanness (so probably about 8 and up, unless your kids are brave). A mouse (and a rat) that do not belong with their peers, that have higher aspirations. And while everybody try to convince them to behave as they should, they know well what they want. A mouse that likes reading, stories and music, and falls in love with a princess. A rat that likes the light, and does not want to be part of the darkness. And a beautiful message that you can do whatever it is that you want, no matter how small you are. The ability to differentiate between a friend and a foe, and that not everybody always has good intentions, even if they are nice to you. The rats are pretty slimy, but smart. The happy ending, that is different from an expected happy ending. Because sometimes in real life we get something different than we wanted, and we can still be very happy with it. DiCamillo is talking occasionally directly to the reader, inviting the reader into the story, half educationally and half sharing a secret. You'll fall in love with Princess Pea, feel pity for Miggery Sow, be afraid of the rats, and befriend the adorable Despereaux. And for sure, laugh out loud and get a chill too. ...more Despereaux is a mouse, one of many in the castle, but he is different from the others.

This is enough to get him banished to the dungeon where the evil rats dwell. This sets in motion a chain of events that will require Despereaux to be as brave as the knights he has read so much about in order to save the lovely Princess Pea. It\u2019s a nice enough story. Maybe kind of simple for a sophisticated reader like myself, and those asides to the \u201cgentle reader\u201d are kind of distracting, but it\u2019s a pleasant tale. Nice. Did I mention that it\u2019s nice? That\u2019s what I thought the first time I read the book. Then, I decided to read it to my daughter. Reading it aloud, I suddenly heard rhythms and cadences in DiCamillo\u2019s writing that hadn\u2019t been evident before. The words rolled off my tongue. They were almost hypnotic. Those asides to the reader felt natural and inviting. And the book was suddenly funny. My eavesdropping husband actually burst out laughing once. My daughter and I (and my husband, too, if he\u2019d admit it) were enchanted. I am repentant. This book is a delight, but one best enjoyed read aloud. Even if you don\u2019t have children, try reading it aloud. I promise I won\u2019t tell. ...more Yes, this book is a perfect Newberry winner. Yes, I thought this was a good book. That is not to say, I always thought it was a real pleasure to read. I didn't. The darkness of the dungeons and of the stair and the life of Miggery Sow were not things I wanted to explore, and I didn't often come to this book wanting to delve back in. I read this book to my kids, and the darkness was really rather dark. I was always surprised the darkness wasn't as dark to them as it was to me.

I read this book to my kids, and the darkness was really rather dark. I was always surprised the darkness wasn't as dark to them as it was to me. Or, perhaps it was, but they needed to hear it and explore it and take it inside them and mull it over. They wanted to explore it, just like a good fairytale (I mean the real ones, not the Disney versions--the real grim Grimm). But, I can appreciate all of this anew, because I also just completed listening to Kate Di Camillo's Newberry Medal acceptance speech, in which she shows her appreciation of darkness as a foil to the light, and as a place to work out the horrors of life. There, I find the merit in this work. She is very much a believer in exploring the complex, darkness in children's stories so they can undertsand and come to terms with the treachery,the perfidy in their own lives and souls. She gives an example of such musings from her childhood of her own complicated 4-year old soul, one that anyone can relate to. And, as she explores the darkness, we see how it can show us the light. ...more Another story my daughter couldn't wait to read to me because she loved it so much.

What I liked most about the story (other than the appearance of gnawed of pages) is the author's questions to the reader and her humorous side commentary about life and literary devices. The story can be dark at times and this livens it up. The writing is utterly charming. Desperaux is an unusual mouse. Instead of eating the edges of books and skirting around corners to avoid people, he loves to read fantasy stories that begin with \"Once Upon A Time\" and end in \"Happily Ever After\" and he is in love with a princess. The story makes the case for knowledge as light and empowerment. Roscuro on the other hand is a mischievous heartless rat who lives in dungeon of the castle and aims to make other's miserable. I liked that the story has all things in it that Despereaux love: knights and villains, princesses and salvation, but that it's not an empty fairy tale. The best way to describe the story would be in DiCamillo's words herself: \"Would you like to hear, reader, how it all unfolded? The story is not a pretty one. There is violence in it. And cruelty. But stories that are not pretty have a certain value, too, I suppose. Everything, as you well know (having lived in this world long enough to have figured out a thing or two for yourself), cannot always be sweetness and light.\" ...more", "Title": "The Tale of Despereaux"},
