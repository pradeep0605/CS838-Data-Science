UPDATE TO MY REVIEW BELOW! I JUST FOUND OUT ON FACEBOOK THAT THIS BOOK IS NOMINATED FOR THE GOODREADS CHOICE AWARD OF 2010!!!! I hope all the people here who have loved it as much as I did will vote and it wins! I got an early reader's copy because my friend works at a bookstore. She gave it to me because I recently had to put down my 14 year old pug and was a total wreck. Seriously, this was the greatest dog book I've ever read, and I've read a lot of them. This was so much better than \"The Art of Racing in the Rain\" which I had liked, but the dog in this book is like, a real dog. He doesn't understand words except for things like \"car ride\" or \"biscuit\" but he totally understands everything that's going on with his people. I cried, but it was like, happy tears, because it truly made me realize that though my dog is gone, I get to keep how much we loved each other, always. It's corny to say it, but this book actually changed my life. In the book, the dog keeps coming back, as a dog, and that means, he can come back to his humans. I don't want to spoil any of what happens, but I honestly believe that what this author says in this fictional world might really be true. It would explain a lot about how dogs connect with us, and how they understand us, and how much they take care of us. We think we rescue them, but I think they rescue us. Seriously, if you ever loved a dog, run, don't walk to get your hands on this. I'm so grateful it was given to me, it's about the only thing that has made me feel better about losing my best friend. ...more Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/ It\u2019s time once a year for my library\u2019s Winter Reading Challenge and my chance to score a FREEEEEEEE coffee mug.

I had put A Dog\u2019s Purpose on the wait list after seeing the preview when I took my kids to see Sing - a movie everyone else apparently loved but I thought was super . . . . My eternal hold finally ended and it was my turn at the perfect time so I read this book on Day 1 of the challenge. And pretty much looked like . . . . . The entire flippin\u2019 time I was reading. The story is about a dog who . . . \u201cWas seized with an inexplicable question, a question of purpose. This didn\u2019t seem like the sort of thing a dog should think about, but I found myself returning to the issue often. Why? Why did I harder a nagging feeling that as a dog there was something I was supposed to do?\u201d Which leads to discovering that . . . . \u201cOf all the things I\u2019d ever done, making ____________ laugh seemed the most important. It was, I reflected, the only thing that gave my life any purpose.\u201d And then . . . . Followed by the dog being reincarnated only to discover . . . . \u201cThis was, I decided, my purpose as a dog, to comfort the boy whenever he needed me.\u201d And . . . . . But not only did the dog provide comfort . . . . \u201cMy purpose, my whole life, had been to love him and be with him, to make him happy.\u201d And oh my god . . . . . Then the dog came back AGAIN and began to question . . . . \u201cCould a dog have more than one purpose?\u201d Leading to . . . . \u201cI was a good dog. I had fulfilled my purpose.\u201d By this point I looked like I had been punched in the face and my family was like . . . . But the story wasn\u2019t over yet and I bet Kleenex stock prices went through the ROOF this morning. I don\u2019t often have emotion (other than happiness and anger), but when I do everyone should watch the eff out. Please note I realize this is not necessarily a \u201cgood\u201d book \u2013 it\u2019s written from a dog\u2019s point of view so it\u2019s pretty simple and it definitely is designed to make you feel all of the things, but I give zero shits.

Creo que W. Bruce Cameron hizo un trabajo fant\u00e1stico al escribir esta novela. Por extra\u00f1o y dif\u00edcil que parezca, al leer este libro realmente cre\u00ed que un perro estaba cont\u00e1ndome la historia. Me encari\u00f1\u00e9 con \u00e9l como si fuera mi mejor amigo y sorpresivamente sent\u00ed emociones que no cre\u00eda que experimentar\u00eda. La pluma del autor es muy ligera, lo que permite que leas el libro entero sin poder parar ni un segundo. Adem\u00e1s creo que bas\u00e1ndonos en las caracter\u00edsticas de la historia, se exige un ritmo r\u00e1pido y se debe buscar el inter\u00e9s, porque cualquiera podr\u00eda pensar que la vida de este animal no tiene nada relevante para aportar. Lo que logra Bruce va incluso m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de eso. Consigue en unas 300 p\u00e1ginas narrar no s\u00f3lo la vida de un ser dedicado, fiel, divertido y entra\u00f1able, sino que tambi\u00e9n hace que te preocupes por \u00e9l y que quieras ser part\u00edcipe de su viaje y su descubrimiento. Si hay algo important\u00edsimo que debo rescatar de este libro es que tiene la capacidad de abrirte un poco los ojos. Al meternos en la cabeza de este perro, podemos conocer sus pensamientos, sus emociones y sus deseos. Sentimos lo que \u00e9l siente, comprendemos lo que \u00e9l entiende del mundo y vemos su percepci\u00f3n ante \u00e9l. Nos damos una idea de c\u00f3mo muchas veces los humanos no valoramos la infinidad de cosas que estos peque\u00f1os amigos tienen para darnos. El amor incondicional que nos entregan, su lealtad de hierro, la comprensi\u00f3n silenciosa que aportan incluso en d\u00edas en que nos sentimos solos en el mundo, su compa\u00f1\u00eda constante, entre millones de otras muestras sinceras de afecto. Ellos no juzgan, no quieren por inter\u00e9s, no buscan m\u00e1s que un par de caricias y el cuidado que se merecen. En fin... dicen que el perro es el mejor amigo del hombre. Este libro me dej\u00f3 ver por qu\u00e9. Y me convenci\u00f3 de que es absolutamente cierto. ...more Because failure isn\u2019t an option if success is just a matter of more effort.

Let me ask a question. Have you ever think of what your purpose in your life? If not, well, you are beaten by a dog. This book tells of a dog who\u2019s seeking it\u2019s purpose in life through four lifetime. The story divided into four parts as the dog lived four lives. The first part it was born as a stray dog named Toby who then caught and hauled into a dog pound. In this first life, the dog learnt for the first time to live with humans. There\u2019s not much human interventions in this life, whatsoever, the dog mostly learnt to live as dogs do, compete with each other for human affection and to dominate other dogs. At the second life, and this is my favorite, he was born as a pure bred golden retriever named Bailey who lived with a family of \u2018mom\u2019, \u2018dad\u2019 and <---C>Ethan</---C>. His purpose in this life, he found out that his purpose was to be with Ethan. This relationship is the sweetest and heartwarming in the whole book. Ethan loved Bailey so much and Bayley loved Ethan more than his life. Bailey\u2019s story is so wonderful full of laughter, fun, playing, snacking, playing and chewing. But it\u2019s also the most touching part in the book for me since I have dogs myself and I mostly can relate the story with my own experiences with my dogs. Bailey is just sooo sweet. ^.^ I now knew why these creatures, these human beings, had so fascinated me from the moment I saw them. It was because my fate was inextricably linked with theirs. Especially Ethan\u2014that was the bond of a lifetime. The third life the dog was quite different. Not only the dog was reborn as a working dog, but also as a female German Shepherd named Ellie. As part of Search and Rescue K-9 unit in the police, there were not too much affections for Ellie. But still she learned a lot of things and took pleasure on finding and saving people like she (or he) \u2018rescued\u2019 Ethan from \u2018drowning\u2019 in the lake in the previous life. Ellie was pretty wonderful and bright dog. The best dog in the department. She even made smart comment about her human partners. Humans were capable of so many amazing things, but too often they just sat making words, not doing anything. And the fourth and last lifetime\u2026 well, I won\u2019t spoil this one except that he\u2019s reborn as a black Labrador. I suppose he\u2019s the dog peeking on the cover. It\u2019s pretty sad. And that ending was just\u2026(T.T) It\u2019s a beautiful, inspiring and touching story from man\u2019s best friend filled with love, friendship and loyalty. The narration is wonderful, taking the dog\u2019s POV and it\u2019s innocently captivating. Now I know what it\u2019s like to be a dog :p. I just fell in love with this book and with Bailey. I can\u2019t wait to watch the movie too. ...more Written from the perspective of a dog, \"<+++>A Dog's Purpose</+++>\" is just as much about people as it is dogs.

Reading the repeated lives of a dog through Toby, Bailey, Elle, and Buddy, I laughed and cried. Bruce Cameron is a masterful author who has captured the complexity of people's relationships with their pets and our struggle to understand ourselves, to give our lives meaning. As a longtime pet owner, now blessed with a 1yo Shetland Sheepdog named Kiyomi, I found myself reflecting upon our relationship with her. The trials of puppyhood and the eccentricities of adulthood weighed on my mind. I found myself wondering how much I have taught her, how much she has taught me, and I hugged more than once reading this as I knew that we both grew in learning about our purpose together. I would highly recommend \"A Dog's Purpose\" to others. I will be reading this book again and again to remind myself about its lessons and the wonderful company I've kept in the companionship of dogs. ...more This is one of the best books I have read. Anyone who has ever had a dog needs to read this. It is funny and heartwarming. I don't just own a dog. I'm the sort of person who considers her chocolate labrador to be a member of the family, so it isn't a stretch for me to believe that a dog has thoughts and feelings. What is a bit too much for me is the idea of a reincarnated dog soul who uses words like \"ignominy.\" And ultimately, though I was moved by the dog's desire to fulfill its purpose, I was disappointed in the narrative voice that Cameron develops for the main character.

Cameron does have a great sense of humor, and there are more than a few scenes in A Dog's Purpose that will warm your heart. Of course, there is plenty to cry about too. In the end, I think the book fulfills its purpose. It reminds the reader that love, even the slobbery kind, is all that matters and all that endures. ...more Three Words, July 6, 2010 By John C.

Brilliant. Actually three. Soul. Bruce Cameron has brought forth a magnificent, touching piece of a soul's journey through life in search of purpose and meaning. At times hilarious and yet other times heart breaking, Bruce brilliantly weaves a story of a dog and its quest that is told with such heart and humanity that anyone who has ever had a dog (or any pet , for that matter) feels that this truly is how they see us and the world in which they live. The humor is real and effortless. You will find yourself laughing out loud. You will also cry. Real tears born out of your life's memories of pets past and the essential intertwining of souls that exists in no other relationship. That bond (from the dog's perspective) is what brings the true love in this novel to life. Though many dream of writing that one great novel, the difference here is that Bruce Cameron has done it right out of the gate and I have a feeling that there is plenty more where that came from. An essential, five star must read. ...more What a unique and heart-rending tale of a dog\u2019s quest to find its purpose for its existence, with a voice and mannerism so childlike and highly convincing \u2013 it will make you believe that it\u2019s written by a dog.

I just adored it and found myself near tears as well as feeling so hopeful that this dog did indeed make a difference in the lives of many. Cameron nailed Toby/Bailey/Ellie/Buddy's voice and developed that voice as the dog \"matured\" through each life. The book starts off with the undeveloped voice of Toby and while Toby's life isn't that long, it really sets up the whole point of the book. I think that some people will have trouble with Toby since this section of the book is really sad and short. Stick with it because once you start reading about how Toby morphs into Bailey, the action really starts and only gets better. The next lives will have you turning the pages to see what happens next. I really hope that the author will write more books like this. I think you will enjoy this if you like Merrill Markoe and Garth Stein. ...more A Dog\u2019s Purpose is one of the most fantastic, wonderful books I\u2019ve ever read.

I called it correctly - and I sobbed through one of them. I thought overall, this was a really interesting read (and definitely made me want to get a dog). Cameron does a great job exploring what a dog's purpose is and showing just how in tune to human emotions they are. I actually found most of the dog's actions to be believable and I loved the ending of the book (to me, it actually felt like a twist). Great book - I'd recommend it to anyone who loves dogs and wants an entertaining (but poignant) read about a dog's life. ...more We're not letting your wife pick books for the book club ever again.

The author missed out on the dog coming back as a sheepdog in Kerry when Bishop Eamonn Casey was motoring along the roads. There's an anecdote fer yez. Maybe it's more of a young adult book. Something for the pre-teen daughters. I like my sentences compound and when I can breeze through a novel in less than two hours, so.... You're clear on this, right? We won't say anything to her. We're all in this together. But when someone asks what book to read for next month, and she pipes up? We'll change the subject or pretend we didn't hear. ...more Zazwyczaj, je\u017celi w ksi\u0105\u017ckach czy w filmach gin\u0105 ludzie, to mnie to nie rusza.

I niemal porycza\u0142am si\u0119 na tym zwiastunie. Wiedzia\u0142am, \u017ce b\u0119d\u0119 chcia\u0142a go obejrze\u0107, bo mam takie masochistyczne tendencje, ale najpierw koniecznie musia\u0142am przeczyta\u0107 ksi\u0105\u017ck\u0119. Tak czu\u0142am. I w moich r\u0119kach znalaz\u0142a si\u0119 powie\u015b\u0107 o cudnej ok\u0142adce, czyli \"By\u0142 sobie pies\" W. Bruce'a Camerona. Spodziewa\u0142am si\u0119, \u017ce w tym wypadku p\u0142aczu nie b\u0119dzie ze wzgl\u0119du na to, \u017ce jest to historia o kilku \u017cywotach jednego psa. Skoro pies ma do wykonania konkretn\u0105 misj\u0119 i b\u0119dzie towarzyszy\u0107 nam przez ca\u0142\u0105 ksi\u0105\u017ck\u0119, tylko za ka\u017cdym razem odziany w inn\u0105 ma\u015b\u0107 i ras\u0119 i \u017ce zawsze b\u0119dzie si\u0119 przecie\u017c odradza\u0142, to na pewno nie b\u0119dzie smutno. Myli\u0142am si\u0119. Kiedy czyta si\u0119 o tym, jak pies patrzy na \u015bwiat, jak interpretuje niekt\u00f3re wydarzenia, to naprawd\u0119 to jest tak urocze, \u017ce zaraz robi si\u0119 ciep\u0142o na serduszku, gard\u0142o si\u0119 zaciska i \u0142zy si\u0119 zbieraj\u0105 w cz\u0119\u015bciach oka, kt\u00f3rych nazw nie znam, mimo \u017ce nie dzieje si\u0119 nic smutnego. Ale tu ta narracja jest niezwykle prawdziwa, poczu\u0142am si\u0119, jakbym s\u0142ucha\u0142a jakiego\u015b psiego dubbingu. Na pocz\u0105tku s\u0142uchamy my\u015bli g\u0142upiutkiego szczeniaczka, gdy robi co\u015b, co podpowiada mu instynkt, gdy wydaje mu si\u0119, \u017ce ma na imi\u0119 \"siad\", albo \"zostaw\", bo tak najcz\u0119\u015bciej zwracaj\u0105 si\u0119 do niego dwuno\u017cni, albo dowiadujemy si\u0119, co czuj\u0119 pies zamkni\u0119ty w samochodzie w upalny dzie\u0144. Poznajemy prawdziwe psie historie, zar\u00f3wno rasowc\u00f3w prosto z wystaw, policyjnych owczark\u00f3w, jak i bezpa\u0144skich kundli. Niezwyk\u0142e jest r\u00f3wnie\u017c to, \u017ce opr\u00f3cz psich \u017cywot\u00f3w, przygl\u0105damy si\u0119 tak\u017ce ludzkim problemom. Plusem narracji jest niepokazanie ich z punktu widzenia osoby trzeciej, obserwatora, ale samego psa, nie do ko\u0144ca rozumiej\u0105cego zachowanie ludzkie. Czytelnik zdaje sobie spraw\u0119, \u017ce wyrzucenie przez kobiet\u0119 b\u0142yszcz\u0105cego k\u00f3\u0142ka z palca oznacza rozw\u00f3d, cho\u0107 pies wie jedynie, \u017ce co\u015b podpowiada mu pocieszenie w\u0142a\u015bcicielki. Wiemy tak\u017ce, czym jest \"szko\u0142a\", mimo \u017ce dla psiaka jest to okres czasu, kiedy nie ma przy nim jego najm\u0142odszego pana. Podziwiam r\u00f3wnie\u017c autora za wiedz\u0119. Historie, kt\u00f3re opowiedzia\u0142 w tej ksi\u0105\u017cce, cz\u0119sto odwo\u0142uj\u0105 si\u0119 do jego prawdziwych czworono\u017cnych przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 z przesz\u0142o\u015bci. Jednak niekt\u00f3re sceny przedstawiaj\u0105ce i wyja\u015bniaj\u0105ce zachowanie ps\u00f3w s\u0105 tak realistyczne, \u017ce - jestem pewna - autor musia\u0142 zg\u0142\u0119bia\u0107 tematy zwi\u0105zane w weterynari\u0105 i behawiorystyk\u0105. Albo w poprzednim \u017cyciu by\u0142 goldenem. W ka\u017cdym razie wszystko, co czytamy sprawia, \u017ce inaczej zaczynamy patrze\u0107 na nasze w\u0142asne psy. W moim wypadku tak by\u0142o. Je\u017celi kto\u015b z Was kocha psy tak bardzo jak ja to my\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce te\u017c b\u0119dzie \"By\u0142 sobie pies\" zauroczony.

Te psiaki tak zaw\u0142adn\u0119\u0142y moim sercem, \u017ce tu mog\u0142aby by\u0107 liter\u00f3wka na liter\u00f3wce, fabu\u0142a mog\u0142aby nie klei\u0107 si\u0119 zupe\u0142nie, a i tak kompletnie nie robi\u0142oby to na mnie wra\u017cenia.

TRZY OSOBY DYSKUTUJ\u0104 O TEJ KSI\u0104\u017bCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGesH... ...more What a beautiful story - I loved this book. My mom won it through First Reads and loved it too; she told me I had to read it. I cried (several times), but Bailey and his story were so worth it.

My mom won it through First Reads and loved it too; she told me I had to read it. I cried (several times), but Bailey and his story were so worth it. Cameron tells the story of Bailey (aka Toby, Ellie, Bear, and Buddy) and his different lives as a dog. In each new life, Bailey is searching for his purpose. The story is told from Bailey's point of view, which was the only way these stories could have been told. While Bailey isn't as intelligent as his humans (like Enzo was in \"The Art of Racing in the Rain\", which is one of my all-time faves), this book has so much depth; what a feat on Cameron's part! Bailey is loyal, affectionate, and smart - for a dog. He doesn't understand most of what the people around him are saying, lending a naive and utterly sweet quality to his character(s). \"A Dog's Purpose\" does what all books - in my opinion - should, and that is get a visceral, pure emotional reaction from the reader. This was a beautiful story that I think people of all ages could appreciate. While Cameron definitely keeps the story from feeling like a children's book, the totally trusting and loving nature of Bailey has a child-like quality to it. I'm kind of amazed actually, at how deep this story is; if you think about it, the only genre of books typically told from an animal's point of view are children's books. While older kids may enjoy this story, the target audience is clearly adults; those who can look back on their lives and the animals that have touched it. While I have a dog that is everything to me right now, this book just screamed with memories of me and the dogs I grew up with that remind me so much of Bailey. I think kids who grow up with dogs are so lucky; you have a friend who is ready to play 24/7 and always exuberant about it, someone you can be with for hours but not need to speak a single word, and someone whose love for you is pure and unwavering. We had to put Jasmine, the lab I grew up with, to sleep a few months back. She was always so excited to us - everything made her happy and while she could be a little dense sometimes, she loved nothing more than being with us, her family. Whatever we were doing, as long as she was there, she couldn't have been happier. Bailey's story helped me see what things must have looked like through her eyes and was in a strange way, comforting. Bailey's story is beautiful and a testament to dogs and the purpose they have in our lives. I highly recommend. But do grab a few tissues - while you'll definitely cry for and over Bailey, you'll also be crying for the dogs that have been in your own life. And those tears are always worth it. ...more I'm a huge fan of Dr. Temple Grandin's books, so when I read on Facebook that she gave a rave review to this book, I had to get it and I agree 100% with her blurb of A Dog's Purpose, \"I loved this book and I could not put it down\".--Dr. Temple Grandin, author of Animals in Translation.

I was so thrilled that this was not yet another anthropomorphized \"talking dog\" as has been done to death in so many other books, the dog narrator of this book doesn't speak English, or understand what his people are saying except as real dogs do. I really think that over time, this book will prove out to be a classic, along the lines of Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol. I can see why it has gotten rave reviews from both critics and readers, but it was Miss Grandin's review that sealed it for me. She's perhaps the world's most well-respected animal behaviorist, and I'm guessing that the reason she loved this book so much is because it's both great fiction, and a narrative voice that feels utterly true to a real dog. Of course, as fiction, we can never know what's \"true\" about what goes on in anyone's mind, much less that of an animal that can't even tell us, but that's what's so great about the book, it *feels* true, which is what fiction is all about. I also agree with what Miss Grandin said in the end of her review of this book, \"It really made me think about the purpose of life. In the end, I cried.\" For me it was both philosophically interesting and deeply emotional. It's changed the way I will relate with my own dogs, and frankly, some of *my people* as well. Really makes you think about what matters in this life, and, perhaps, the next. ...more A Dog's Purpose is a dog story, but whether you like dogs or not, this is also a brilliant and eye-opening story about life, death and the meaning of it all.

I have a sneaking suspicion that quite a few people in our family will be getting this one as a Christmas gift this year. We come from a family of dog lovers and honestly, this book is the sort of thing that really helps those of us who love dogs (and consider them to be honored members of the family) to deal with the fact that when we bring them into our lives, we already know that we will outlive them. It should be a heartbreak, but it's just the nature of the bond between our species. For all the unconditional love and loyalty they give, this is the price we must pay, this certain knowledge that we will one day have to say goodbye. Whether or not you believe the premise of this book (that dogs reincarnate and remember all their incarnations) the book should speak to you as a metaphor at the very least. This bond between animal and man is greater than our mortal lives. This book addresses that great truth headlong, which is why I predict people will read it for many generations to come. It's like Black Beauty, a book that will survive the ages. ...more If you love dogs, read this book. All I can say is that I cried, a lot.", "Title": "A Dog's Purpose"},
