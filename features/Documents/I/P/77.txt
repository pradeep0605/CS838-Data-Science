I don't remember being so bored by a book since The Host by Stephenie Meyer. I think this was more boring than Night Star ! UGH!! Look at the book covers! Beautiful, aren't they? Too bad the stories are not! Okay, I admit, it has a good premise: Two immortals fighting for their love for centuries! It sounded promising.<---F> But, NOOOO</---F>. It had to be so poorly done. This series fails at: Characters, dialogue, even a PLOT! I mean, it has been the same plot since Blue Moon . Damen and <---C>Ever</---C> are still finding an antidote to their chaste. Is that even a plot?! Where's the REAL conflict in this? Okay, they had enemies, but so what? At least those enemies were well-made unlike this books! They're as predictable as a dog chasing its tail. And <---A>Alyson Noel</---A> can't seem to get enough of the words \"swallow hard\", \"squint\", \"press my lips together\", and fucking \"TINGLE AND HEAT\"!! Find new words, you BEEEEEEPPP!!!! Where was I? Oh, yeah! This book. <+++>Everlasting</+++> . Yawn. Ever and Damen finally got rid of their awful enemies. Yaaaay. But, there's something left: Finding their sex-a-lot potion. Since Haven burned the last bit of it, their genitals got sad and they want the antidote ASAP! But it won't be easy. A loony old woman who does riddles tells Ever and Damen that they have to do a task first. She calls her Adelina, which is weird because, who the hell is she? I'm glad you asked. Adelina was the secret past of Ever. In fact, they wasted 50+ pages explaining it! Was it really necessary? *clears throat* Jude still makes an appearance in here, even though Ever told him: Oh, and by the way, he hooks up with Honor at the end. Hee-hee. You mad about the spoilers? Moving on . . . The first task is to free their enemies souls. HA! As if! But incredible as it is, it was possible. Chapter 24 was the cheesiest chapter I have ever read! The villains suddenly turned good and and they're happy as kids! I'M. NOT. KIDDING. I can still smell the rainbows. Once Ever is done, the loony tells her that she must get the apple from The Tree Of Life(Hmm, I think I heard about that in the Bible. . .) so she can get the real immortality. The immortality of the soul. Not physical, spiritual. Okay? Of course, Damen(big surprise), refuses because he likes his immortality just fine. ASSSSHOOOOOLEEE. Thanks for showing your true colors, Damen! But at the same time, I agree with him: Ever, why are so so STUPID?! You finally had the change to have the fucking of your life and you wasted it away!! ARRRRRGHHH!!!! Okay, she found the tree(even though Roman's army got there first), took the fruit and . . . guess what? SHE WAS IN SUMMERLAND FOR SIX MONTHS!!!! OH. MY. GOD. She makes up with everybody: To Jude, Honor, even Sabine, which she finally tells her her eternity secret. And for last . . . Damen. She convinces him that the Tree really exists, which Damen believes, but he still won't eat the fruit. Oh and by the way, the antidote is READY!! WHOO!! But Ever refuses. *audience groans* She really wants spiritual immortality even if it means that they're not immortal anymore. Then, Damen does the whining version of solving their problems(which he had done already): Stop talking to her. How charming. A party later, the Loony introduces the immortal army of Roman to get a taste of the Fruit. Some of them eat them, some don't. Ever comes back for a reconciliation with Damen. After talking, Damen and Ever finally bit down the fruit, and TA-DA!! They're mortals now. And finally, they book a hotel room and . . . the moment people should finally care . . . Wait for it . . . They have sex. Huh? Huh? Impressive, huh? The moment was describe as magical, but this is how it goes in my head: \"Ever, you want some of this? I'm horny.\" Oh, yes Damen! My body is ready.\" It has been since the first book. \"Are you ready, my dear Ever?\" Ever: \"YES!!\" OMG! Things are getting hot!! And . . . HAVING SEX! HAVING SEX! And . . . done. I like my version ten times better. Then, they fly to Italy, and live happily ever after. THE. FUCKING. END. So, here it is. My thoughts of <+++>Everlasting</+++> . Did I have fun? NO. Was it worth it? Yes. Because I love reviewing bad books. Will I do it again to other books? PERHAPS. It's good to be bad. ...more i cant wait to read this but i think im the only one who is devastated that this is the last book After Reading I was kinda hoping for like some kinda twist to make up for the drag but ....i guess there kind of was ..... but still it was really predictable everyone knew that they were going to find the antidote and live happily ever after and stuff.... all in all i guess it was a good book ...im sad (and relieved) its over . Thank God this series is over! I thought that Night Star is the last. And I wish it is. ugh! _________ Whats with the crappy cover? [groan!] anyway, Im glad that they gonna find that damn antidote, and go in some expensive Hotel and you know whats next. LOL And the story will come to an end. thats the BEST part right? I give this book 2 stars Before Reading it: I added this because the cover is soooo prettty!!! :D Hope the end is better than the rest of the series. I loved the first one, maybe just maybe I will love this one too. After reading it: I wanted to love it.. I wanted to finsih this series on a good note. But....... I must be honest: I have to admit that I skim read most of this book, I got bored at the beginning and when we had to go back in time and listen to all that stuff about Ever being Adelina or w I give this book 2 stars Before Reading it: I added this because the cover is soooo prettty!!! :D Hope the end is better than the rest of the series.

Fruit>??????????? Thats the big magic cure we have been waiting for? Okay so it's not the antidote but still freakin' fruit? Thats it??? I mean yes she wasn't going to eat fire or anything but it's just not what I was expecting. This series is soooo frustrating. The key to not being immortal all along was fruit, now they are both human and skip off into the sunset? I hate the ending, it all just seemed rushed and thrown together and I hate how Ever is just so annoying. No matter what Damon does she always never seems content. :( I did like how they end up together though, I had hoped they would stay together after everything they have been through. Obvioulsy now that Roman isn't in the picture, I loved him wayy better than Damon. ;) And if I had a choice I would choose Ever and Roman together. I really wanted this book to be better. ...more I hate it when people say horrible things about author's work. No wonder why new writers don't want to come out with their ideas because it's people who say mean things about their ideas.

God! I'm going to zone out reading this and have to re-read it again just so i can get the point! thank God this is the last one! I'm already dying because i have to get Night Star, i don't know what i'd do if there was a 7th book... Ever is seriously testing my patience with this series I think I can sum up the whole series with this: It's about two people who will do everything in their power to have sex. It was a waste of time, space, paper, money, and every other thing you can think of. It's an embarrassment to YA literature, and that's me putting it lightly. See my full review of the whole series over at my blog. Ok idk if it was my exciment for this to be over or if it was legit good but this was my favorite one of the series. 4.5 stars \"Will they be united-or torn apart forever?\" They both die. The end. Thank you Alyson Noel for creating this wonderful series! I am so happy to have made this journey and am sad that it is over. Hopefully theres a movie comming out in the near future? hmmmm Favourite Quote: \"The two of us refusing to look back, knowing it's better to look forward, toward the future, than to long for a past that's gone forever.\" When I got asked to review this book, I said yes for one reason.

I wanted to know if Ever and Damen finally do it..... uh-hum I mean find a cure of course ;) The Immortals series and I have certainly had our ups and DOWNS but I have always been fascinated by this spellbinding world Noel has created. I remember reading the blurb for the first book and thinking this sounds good. The concept of being immortal, spending centuries fighting for love is perfect for the romantic at heart which we all know I am. And then you have magical Summerland and being able to manifest whatever your heart desired (like red tulips - although that trick gets a bit old when Damen is driving you crazy) and it adds a refreshing element to this story about out of the ordinary love. One thing I like about Noel's writing is that plot is constantly full of surprises. No other couple has had to work as hard for a happy ending then Ever and Damen. They have had so many struggles that have provided many nail-biting-edge-of-my-seat moments. While there was still a few completely unexpected twists in Everlasting it's pace felt a little slower or maybe that is because we know a happy ending is in sight.....or is it? A lot of my difficulty with this series has been with the character but I felt you could really see how much Ever has grown in this final installment. I swear she didn't annoy me once! In the earlier books she frustrated me with her decisions as I felt she would make mistake after mistake and never really learn from them. But she is now making smart choices. It makes me very happy to see her turn into a stronger and smarter young women. Now Damen, I felt he was disappointing. I didn't feel he had the charm and confidence and was a bit too brooding for my taste but I did like the way he will do anything to protect Ever and his unconditional love for her. As for the romance between Ever and Damen it was very sweet. (view spoiler) [That big finally DO IT moment was rather too perfect and a little boring. A four post bed in front of a fireplace and there was no mention of protection. However my favourite romantic scenes were the flashback of their moments together in previous centuries. It was passionate (well compared to the other scene) and you could see the sparks flying. (hide spoiler) ] . Overall, fans of The Immortals are going to love Everlasting. It is a perfect and surprising end to this popular series. ...more After so long, it's over. It's finally over.

This was a book was interestingly original while still maintaining a comforting familiarity. The protagonist, Ever, wasn't overpowering or whiny and didn't take long to explain why she acted so strangely.

This was a book was interestingly original while still maintaining a comforting familiarity. The protagonist, Ever, wasn't overpowering or whiny and didn't take long to explain why she acted so strangely. Her relationship with Damen and her friend's, Miles and Haven was sincere and the way she dealt with High School enemies was more or less ordinary. Though she seemed a bit desensitized from the memory of her family her family with whom she'd recently parted. The overall plot of the first book was clear and consice. Which is more than I can say for the rest of the series. Blue Moon. Ever is now an immortal and is spending more time with her new found love, Damen, in a place called Summerland. Here she learns to manifest items at will. As the book progresses we see Ever grow stronger and in turn Damen grow weaker. In the end she is tricked by a rogue immortal named Roman into giving Damen a cure containing her blood. This helps him regain his strength but mean's that if they ever touched, Ever's DNA would kill Damen. In my opinion, she completely acted out of character. Shadowland. In this book Ever and Damen learn of the Shadowland, the place where those without a soul lay to rest. Jude, an ordinary mortal with knowledge of the mystical beings of the world. Though how he knows so much confuses me as his only information source is his carer Lina. As nice as his chaacter is, I feel that his existence is a little pointless. It seems Noel wrote him to give the series a 'love triangle' of sort's. But Ever only lets Jude think he has a chance with her when she never loved him as anything more than a friend. In the end he almost kills Haven (a character which I didn't like anyway) but surprise, surprise give's Ever the option to save her and turn her into an immortal. Not only a selfish move but it lands her in heaps of trouble in the next book. Dark Flame. This was basically pages and pages of nothing. Suddenly Damen and Ever grow apart and she thinks she loves Roman, because she accidently binds herself to him when a spell she performs goes wrong, I actually went back a few chapters to make sure I did't miss anything. Ever seemed like she hated Roman and his smarmy ways. But now it seems that this was what she loved about him. Haven also becomes obsessed with him. In the end Jude ruins Ever's chance to get the antidote by killing roman. Haven walks in and blames Ever for his death and plans to get her revenge. Night Star. At this point I thought this series was a lost cause but I continued to read it to see how it ended. Haven's vendetta against Ever proves to be a problem for everyone. So Ever brakes up with Damen to see if she love's Jude more (she doesn't) and Damen tells Miles about everything. Haven turns super evil and tries and fails to kill Ever because she is 'unkillable' (not my words) then she tries to kill Miles just after she throws a shirt with the antidote stained on it, into a fireplace. Ever realises she must be stopped and sends her to the Shadowland with a mighty punch to her weakest chakra. Can't say I missed her, but she did make this book a decent read. Everlasting. Couldn't really get into this book because of the boring start. It seemed quite rushed like Noel was trying to quickly find a solution to everyone's problems. She gives ever a floating oracle called lotus to send Ever on countless journeys to put right all her wrongs. In the end she releases Drina, Roman and Haven from the Shadowland so they can move on, at which point Roman gives her the antidote in list form. Then she, being 'the chosen one' has to find a tree which bear's fruit, that can reverse the immortal spell. She and Damen decide to become mortals and be together for the rest of their natural lives. Not exactly what I'd expected but, an ending no less.

For the people who don't fall into any of these categories, because you read it, and actually liked it, I apologize if I offend your taste in literature, and also that I follow the many, many people who wrote reviews that generally elaborate on the serie's suckiness. For the purpose of this review, I will be targeting all the books in 1 shot, so bear with me. Evermore- we have the stereotypical, currently, teen female protanigist (let's just call her a character, she's by no means a hero): [recently/always] an outcase, mad at the world, and obviously super-gorgeously perfect to the one super-goreously perfect guy that everyone wants, but who only wants the main female. Let's throw in some supernatural elements, a dash of romance, accidentally upend the container of 'cheesy' moments, but then add a pinch of mystery and suspense. Might as well throw in my copy of Twilight , since Evermore is really a Twilight remake to a T, although Damen/Damien/ whoever the hell he is is not a vampire, BUT AN IMMORTAL. Much more credible, and less sparkly. The-Other-4-Books-Whose-Names-I-Don't-Remember-Nor-Do-I-Care-Enough-to-Search: Stuff happened, or maybe not. OH YAH, the super-gorgeously perfect girl gets another love interest, problems may or may occur, girl makes mistake, VILLAIN, and then other filler, love here and there, and you've got 4 books, with at least 300 pgs each, summarized in a barely-run-on sentence. I really draw a blank when I think of these books... Sorry :/ Nightstar- I'm going to give you a spoiler, excuse me, and tell you the best part of this book: THAT IT ENDS AND MARKS THE ENDING OF THE SERIES. And I think stuff happens, but I can't be too sure, since I was more focusing on how many pages I had left. Sorry, Ms. Noel, I'm sure you're a fabulous person, but I personally have sort of no respect for your series. And while I'm trashing it now, like 3 years ago, when I was 12 maybe, I liked it. Fast-forward even a few months, and I realized that it really had absolutely no substnace to it whatsoever. So there it is. But before I leave, here is a fabulous little story of how I screwed myself over even more with this series: my friend had all of the books, and I'm a good little girl, so once I start a series, I have to finish it, no matter how tortured I feel. So I decided around a year ago, that I should reread the whole series (4 books at the time) before reading the 5th. Big. Mistake. Don't make it. Reading the series once through is bad enough, don't make yourself read it again. By the 6th book, I didn't care at all. What I can say, though, for this series: awesome cover art. Quite good and mysterious. ...Then that's kind of the best part of the entire book. But the covers are pretty, and mysterious, but don't be fooled. So BEWARE. If you didn't read a word of this review, these words will suffice: DON'T. (under any circumstance) READ. (even if your little heart is begging for some romance-fiction- if you're reading this because you like romance at 13, it'll get better. Don't stoop so low, I'm begging you.) IT. (the series- not even the first page. Heck, dont' even pick it up). EVER. (< You may even want to declare it taboo at your school. Perfectly understandable. There are much better books out there for people that just want a light read. Even for the romance-junkies. ...more Okay. So I didn't read the 4th and won't read the 5th, but I think I might actually read this last book just so I can know how this ends! I've always had a problem with not finishing series, and I thought I had finally cut the cord on this one. But I just really want to know what happens to the annoying Ever and Damen. And the funniest thing about it is, I can guarantee you it won't matter that I skipped the 4th and 5th. The author spends so much time catching you up.... UPDATE: So here's the deal Okay. So I didn't read the 4th and won't read the 5th, but I think I might actually read this last book just so I can know how this ends!

And the funniest thing about it is, I can guarantee you it won't matter that I skipped the 4th and 5th. The author spends so much time catching you up.... UPDATE: So here's the deal with this series. I actually enjoyed the first and second book. The 3rd was terrible, and I couldn't even get past the first 40 pages of the 4th one. But, as stated above, I decided to read the last book so I could get closure from the first 2 books. And as predicted, it did not matter at all that I missed two books. It appears that literally nothing happened, and what did happen was told to me over and over again. I really wish this series would have had just 3 books - the first 2, and this one. But because this dragged on and on and on, I am going to look back at this series with distaste. (At least I didn't read the 4th and 5th, I probably would DESPISE this series then.) That being said, this book wasn't that terrible. I almost gave it 3 stars, but the truth is that it was boring at times, and I HATE DAMEN. I can only give it 2 stars due to the fact that Damen sucks and Ever is stupid. I did like the ending, however, and am actually happy that I read it and I know what happened. I am so glad I can officially shelve this series. ...more i liked this book better than all the others becuasae ever was finally the kick butt heroaine, that finally made the RIGHT decisions. also Damen was more of a character with emotions and decisions instead of a pawn. Omg. Another one? I can't stand this series anymore. I'm soo glad its finally going to be over. NO MORE EVER and her REPEATED MISTAKES :D :D:D !!! :) Hmm, like many people I will be reading this because I can't leave a series unfinished. To be quite frank I'm rooting for the other guy; Jude is hot, exciting and I bet I'm not the only one who wished Ever would just do him already. Damen, on the other hand, is manipulative and one of those crazy anti sex devices they put in teen fiction - we get it Noel: sex = disaster, so don't do it kids. But isn't this all a bit familiar, didn't Myer go through this whole, woe betide anyone who has sex thing Hmm, like many people I will be reading this because I can't leave a series unfinished.

I can pretty much guess how it will end, the curse will be lifted and Ever will FINALLY have sex with her true love Damen, yawn. Is this realistic? Do teenagers really make self denying decisions, based on mature hindsight, well judging by my own experience, I would say no. Teenage fiction should reflect the teenage spirit, which although at times is mopey, is mostly spontaneous, rather than monotonous/ monogamous. ...more Omg how painful it was to read this book!!!

I don't know why Noel INSISTS on writing Jude in the story. I LOVE JUDE. And okay, so he's not the right one for Ever, but damnit, I hate that Ever kept blaming him for \"always ruining everything.\" On top of that, she's just asking for trouble by continuously inviting him back into her life. And let's not forget Roman, Drina and Haven - and somehow Miles fits in all of this too - so we don't exactly have a love TRIANGLE now, do we? I've got to hand it to Noel in coming up with an alternate theory on the reincarnating cycle. HOWEVER, I think the way she executed the story was just utterly ridiculous. First, the whole concept of Damen and Ever not being able to touch or swap DNA would be SO much more interesting if they didn't have a Shadowland or Summerland to go to and actually - well, touch. Cheaters! Then, we have an elixir that was created, basically the reversal was fruit - something that grew naturally - although it was magical, it was so ummm\u2026 blah? And all of them swinging from branch to branch like an \"agile monkey?\" I was also really annoyed that Noel couldn't decide whether she should write Sabine in or leave her out. I mean, come on. I know she didn't want to do the whole disappearing parent/guardian syndrome, but Sabine's role in this book was just off. She is totally left in the dark for SIX BOOKS about Ever's powers, and Ever disappears for six months like nothing. And I could have done without the drama with Damen at the end. But we do get to the moment we've all been waiting for. I just wish it had been more exciting. It was more of a \"FINALLY\" than anything. I don't know. I'm done. No looking back. ...more This really was a great end to an otherwise frustrating journey... So glad to see Ever grow up and become a mature young adult... Though I wish they'd gone the way they first intended... By getting married first... I guess that's just old fashioned... I like the direction this one took, going a more serious and deep route... Enlightenment, journey of the soul, eternal life in the spiritual sense... Very deep stuff... I can relate to alot of that myself in my own life...

Only wouldn't it be nice if you really could just manifest things, transport yourself to exotic local with just your mind and speak telepathically to your lover... Great job Alyson... Look forward to reading more of your work... ;) ...more If Ever and Damon don't end up together I will be sooooooo pissed...... *********************** REAL REVIEW ***************************** Alas, the Immortals series has ended.

The Immortals series was never a top choice of mine. They were always on a lower half of a three-star rating for me, but they were nice, easy reads nonetheless. Evermore started out as a bit of a Twilight knock-off but eventually evolved itself into a series that stood its own ground. Alyson Noel thought out the series' mythology pretty well and offered the reader with topics such as reincarnation, ma To start this review out on a positive note, Ever acts significantly less idiotic in this novel.

Evermore started out as a bit of a Twilight knock-off but eventually evolved itself into a series that stood its own ground. Alyson Noel thought out the series' mythology pretty well and offered the reader with topics such as reincarnation, magic, afterlives, etc. I never liked this series for the Ever/Damen relationship - it was the weakest part of the stories for me, and the we-can't-have-sex storyline is idiotic - but it was enjoyable to see Noel's ideals presented in a watered-down way for her young-adult audience. That being said, Everlasting was my least favorite novel of the series. Like I said, this series was never a favorite of mine, but the simple good vs. evil conflicts and the petty, high school drama helped keep me engaged enough to finish these. This novel takes the series in a completely different direction, and what I didn't enjoy the most is the lack of any real conflict. In the past novels, we had a clear-cut, Ever vs. Roman and/or Ever vs. Haven conflict, but that ended in Night Star . Basically, this novel is a lot of reflection and discussion for the first seventy-five pages, a pilgrimage in the middle, and then more reflection and discussion to wrap it up. There wasn't a lot to keep me engaged in what was going on. While I enjoyed that this ending wasn't just an ending for Ever and Damen but for many immortals as well, it still left something to be desired. Without really giving anything away, the ending kind of wraps the series around to where it began, and it just felt off. Maybe it was just too fairy-tale, everything's-perfect for me. When finishing a series, I like some spark of emotion (I was a basket case after finishing His Dark Materials ), but I felt nothing when this ended. If you've read all five books leading up to this, you obviously have to see how it ends. That's really the only reason I finished this; I just wanted to see what actually happens. Just don't expect too much out of it. Oh, and can I say Alyson Noel writes the most awkward sex scenes ever? For the love of God. ...more", "Title": "Everlasting"},
