Don\u2019t believe me? What if I told you that the book \u2013 which is 200 pages long \u2013 only covers about two hours of time: the first two hours of a newlywed couple\u2019s honeymoon in which they fumble to consummate their marriage? And that both of them have very embarrassing sexual dysfunctions? Well, that\u2019s what the book is abo The first thing you should know about this book is that, like the other Ian McEwan books I\u2019ve read, it is about the most uncomfortable, awkward, and squirmy thing you\u2019ll ever read. Don\u2019t believe me?

And that both of them have very embarrassing sexual dysfunctions? Well, that\u2019s what the book is about. The reader looks on helplessly and squirmingly as two virgins, <---C>Edward</---C> and Florence, sit in a hotel room on the beach embarrassed out of their minds. It\u2019s 1962, on the cusp of the sexual revolution, and the pair have neither the presence of mind or even the vocabulary to communicate openly with each other. There is only a handful of words spoken until the very last chapter of the book (it was tough for me not to use the word climax here, but I try to stay classy). For the first 50 pages or so I was convinced that McEwan was just selling a freak show to us (again) \u2013 that he\u2019s a popular author because people like reading about sex and other people\u2019s weirdo sex problems. Who needs a plot or well-executed sentences when we could have incest, brain damage, erectile dysfunction, and a 30,000 word sex scene? Bring on other peoples\u2019 guilt and shame! But I kept reading and I\u2019m glad I did. Through a number of seamless flashbacks, the history of the couple unfolded before me \u2013 so slowly and steadily and adeptly that I am now convinced that Ian McEwan is a genius.<---F> A dirty old man genius</---F>. It made me think back to a few years ago when Ben and I were lucky enough to interview Jim Shepard, Ben\u2019s favorite contemporary writer and a visiting author at the University of Montana (visiting because Ben requested him, no less). We sat in the Union Club sipping straight whiskeys and Jim Shepard told us that the truly great books (he was specifically talking about Marilynne Robinson\u2019s Housekeeping) are books that are constantly revelatory. And that\u2019s exactly what I though about <+++>On Chesil Beach</+++>. Everyone \u2013 we\u2019re talking about the characters and me \u2013 were learning and understanding more and more deeply with each page. It felt like a blossoming or, to be less lame and corny, like a picture very slowly coming into focus. Many times when authors reveal information it seems cheap or as if they were withholding it from you in order to keep you reading \u2013 dime mystery book stuff. But McEwan\u2019s real gift is in the natural and subtle ways that he presents information to the reader. In fact, many of the biggest revelations in the book are never said outright, but only seep into the story until you understand each one as truth. It\u2019s really pretty well done. So \u2013 if you can handle cringing non-stop for three or four hours and have a strong stomach, you should pick up this book. And let me know if you can figure out exactly how McEwan does what he does, because I\u2019d like to know about it. ...more Having read my first McEwan, I think I can begin to understand why so many good friends feel conflicted about him, even though almost all my friends have recorded positive reviews for this particular novel - the reason I chose this one over others. <+++>On Chesil Beach</+++> is hilariously funny, boldly intimate, and admirably candid when it describes the internal turmoil of its characters and their struggles to interpret their own truths, but taken whole I think the novel is just so so: the story, the basi Having read my first McEwan, I think I can begin to understand why so many good friends feel conflicted about him, even though almost all my friends have recorded positive reviews for this particular novel - the reason I chose this one over others. On Chesil Beach is hilariously funny, boldly intimate, and admirably candid when it describes the internal turmoil of its characters and their struggles to interpret their own truths, but taken whole I think the novel is just so so: the story, the basic premise that holds it, is very contrived and a whole lot of fillers in the shape of flashbacks have been thrown in to make it big enough to be a novel. 1962. Newly married couple. Wedding Night. Virgins. Afraid of sexual failure = our storyline. Much can be said about Florence's total lack of interest in sex, her fear of intimacy, her disgust at being touched. Okay, we know she was a 'product of her time' - a time just before the cultural change that revolutionized romance and sex in the West; - we know social conditioning had led her to view sex as dirty and corrupting, and we know there had not existed an acceptable common language to discuss those matters; and we know that she was kind of introvert with a singular aim of making it big in the world of classical music. Some of those possibilities are explored briefly, some only alluded to, but none of those make her problem convincing I hoped in vain to learn something startling at the end, something Zweig-like. But there was nothing. Was she frigid or asexual, a claim Edward, her one-night husband, hurls at her as an accusation? Was there some other psychological reason from her past that changed her attitude towards copulation? Perhaps. She says at one point, Perhaps what I really need to to d0 is kill my mother and marry my father. - she did not seem to have an emotional attachment with either of her parent, not in the normal sense. Or was she a 'queer' and did not know about her own sexuality? I admit this last one felt like the most plausible reason. But perhaps none of it matters to the story. It is not about sex but the failure of romance, about lack of faith in one's own abilities, about missed opportunities, about the passing of time, about doing nothing. How an entire course of a life can be changed--by doing nothing. The novel works as a basic portrait of the 1960s England with focus on London, Oxford and its vicinity, its cultural and political scene, and two young people from different classes growing up apart and coming together in an uneven relationship that ends in a horrible crash on the Chesil Beach. And that was that. Also, it gets rather treacly in the end, to make us feel sorry for the couple, enlarging on their romance post-breakup, summing up their whole lives after going separate ways in two or three pages that should not have been inflicted on the reader.

In fact, I can literally give you the entire plot of this 200-page, paperback-sized book in literally 177 words; and this is a major spoiler alert , by the way, because I'm not kidding, I really am about to tell you the entire storyline of On Chesil Beach from beginning to end, without skipping a single detail, in 177 words. Ready? A young middle-class couple get married in England in 1962, and spend their wedding night on Chesil Beach. He only got married because he's horny as hell and lives in middle-class 1962 England, where getting married is the only chance you're going to have to get laid, and as a result has now become a cuckold employee of his upper-class father-in-law; she despises the very idea of sex altogether, but is too much of a coward to tell her husband, instead spending months psyching herself up into performing her upcoming \"wifely duties.\" The wedding night arrives. He gets so excited that he has a premature ejaculation on his wife's stomach. She becomes so disgusted that she flees the room in a panic. He chases her down the beach, where they have an explosive argument based on mutual misunderstanding of each other's behavior. She leaves him that night and their marriage is annulled (presumably). And he spends the rest of his life thinking about \"the relationship that was never meant to be.\" No, dude, seriously, that's it; that's the entire freaking plotline of the book . Which, fine, I don't necessarily mind when it's a 10,000-word short story in a literary magazine, that I'm reading on a boring Sunday afternoon down at my neighborhood cafe; but seriously, as a standalone book for 22 damn dollars? And that the Booker committee has the gall to nominate as the best novel of the entire year? Seriously? Are you kidding me?

It is clinical and understated from the start: \u201cThe wedding... had gone well\u201d and the \u201cweather... not perfect but entirely adequate\u201d and continues in the bedroom with detailed descriptions of physical sensations of skin, muscle, and even individual hairs, \u201cstroking... for more than one and a half minutes\u201d (too precise). Florence is \u201cincapable of rudeness\u201d, Edward \u201cpolite to a fault\u201d and both are virgins and unable to discuss intimate things (\u201cThere were no words to name what had happened, there existed no shared language.\u201d), leading to misunderstandings, lost opportunities and unexpected consequences. Edward is guided by duty. Florence is guided by guilt (though not being religious, she can\u2019t get absolution) and has a \u201cvisceral dread\u201d of sex, realising that \u201csex with Edward could not be the summation of her joy, but was the price she must pay for it\u201d. DESTINY A major theme is destiny, which is perhaps the converse of missed opportunities. \u201cThey regarded themselves as too sophisticated to believe in destiny\u201d, yet it was a belief in destiny that prompted Florence to form her quartet and they inferred the hand of destiny in the extreme improbability of their meeting, plus Edward wants to study and write about how powerful individuals can change destiny. CONTRASTS They are very different: Florence is a classical musician from a privileged academic city background, lacking in confidence except where music is concerned. Edward is quiet but (in the past) occasionally explosive, an historian from a rural \u201csqualid family home\u201d with a brain damaged mother. Both are used to leaving things unsaid: Florence is \u201cadept at concealing her feelings from her family\u201d and \u201clived in isolation within herself\u201d, while Edward grew up in a family that colluded in his mother\u2019s fantasy of a well-run household by not talking about it and secretly chose a London university instead of Oxford as part of \u201chis sense of a concealed life\u201d. Their musical tastes are fundamentally incompatible (though they try), yet for Florence music is her \u201cpath to pleasure\u201d, rather than physical intimacy. Although Edward\u2019s family home was chaotic and somewhat repressed, it was loving. He enjoys the \u201cexotic opulence\u201d of Florence\u2019s home and although not a social climber, \u201chis desire for Florence was inseparable from the setting\u201d. Florence was raised by nannies, and her mother is uninterested in her, tone deaf and \u201chad barely ever touched her daughter\u201d. Her relationship with her father is more subtle, but perhaps more troubling. Sometimes she found him \u201cphysically repellent\u201d and sometimes she\u2019d hug and kiss him, and loather herself for it; she even jokes about marrying him. Although \u201che never touched her... in Edward\u2019s sight\u201d, they were \u201cintensely aware of each other\u201d (he did hug her sister), and took overnight trips alone together, even sharing a room on the boat. At times she feels more like the parent or child of Edward rather than his girlfriend or wife. EBB and FLOW There is plenty of see-sawing in the book: the ebb and flow of desire; who to blame for what goes wrong (both in the minds of the characters and the readers); Florence\u2019s feelings about her father and whether or not she thinks there is something wrong with Edward or herself. NOWADAYS The story, and especially the ending, would be implausible nowadays, but fits the characters and the period. It feels awkward to write this, but my parents married at almost exactly the same ages, in almost the same year, and I can see many similarities in aspects of my mother's upbringing and attitudes and Florence's. I doubt she'd see that (or want to). The fact that Edward \u201cfell away from history to live snugly in the present\u201d seems entirely appropriate. It is a raw and painful book in places, all the more ironic given that it is set in the allegedly \u201cswinging 60s\u201d (with additional irony from the fact that Florence takes Edward\u2019s cherry \u2013 but only at dinner). COMPLEMENTARY NOVELS Two were written in the 60s, about the 60s, and feature a woman struggling with sexual intimacy, against the zeitgeist of the swinging 60s: Margaret Drabble\u2019s The Millstone Lynne Reid Banks' The L Shaped Room One of my two favourite books, this was written in the 60s, describing the life (and awful marriage) of a man born at the turn of the century, John Williams' exquisite Stoner Also, Julian Barnes' 1986 novel, Staring at the Sun , has similarly poignant anxiety about sex, though it takes a more humorous angle.

In the beginnin Most people have already heard of Ian McEwan's presumable masterpiece Atonement , but many of his other novels have remained underrated ever since.

In this short book, Ian McEwan reverses the love story and tells it backwards from their wedding night, allowing those events described to find a climax which might take them into a future with each other or separate them forever. In the beginning, Edward and Florence prepare each other for their wedding night. It is the year 1962; a time when talking about sexuality was not as easy and natural as it would be fifty years later. Both Edward and Florence are virgins; however, Florence believes Edward to be experienced with other women, and Edward doesn't know about Florence's anxiety to even think of sexual relationships, of the disgusting feeling which builds in her stomach whenever her thoughts wander off to this night she fears so much. It is a simple premise, a fact which keeps this book from becoming as interesting and masterful as the complex Atonement , yet a premise intriguing enough for me to become interested in the characters. And interesting and complex they were indeed. Ian McEwan's prose is beautiful as ever in this novella. He belongs to those writers you only have to read a few sentences from and immediately know they have been written by him. There is something powerful behind the words he chooses, something that makes you care for the characters even if it is sometimes difficult to understand their motivations. This simple story is able to say so much about human nature: how it is mandatory to talk to each other honestly about one's fears and feelings, because remaining silent could almost never lead into a happy future. Over the course of 200 pages, Ian McEwan spends one fateful evening with his two main characters and their wedding night, yet the only time this book feels boring is when pages and pages of background information are inserted, something which would not have been necessary, considering the precision the characters have already been developed with. But who if not Ian McEwan could have been able to talk about a wedding night for 200 pages and never make it appear senseless or as if he went rambling? Overall, my third McEwan novel proved to be a surprisingly interesting and insightful read, though while a lot better than The Innocent , not as complex and stunning as Atonement . Recommended for everyone interested in a convincing, yet not perfect love story written by a male author, although it may not be the best novel to start with if you want to get into McEwan's writing. ...more This was a nice, short novel about two people consummating their marriage. They are both young and unexperienced and the book follows their short love story up and past the point of marriage. I enjoyed the book. It was simple and short with an entertaining storyline behind it. I listened to this book on audio cd and loved the interview with the author. It really explained the story well. Ian Mc Ewan is fast becoming one of my favourite authors. This is a short, simple story about a newly married couple called Florence and Edward and how \" You can ruin everything by not speaking up\" I listened to this book which was narrated by Ian McEwan and what a wonderful experience that was.

You've got your erotic writers, fine, if your need for arousal and release comes from text rather than pictures or actual lovers. There are certainly millions of toss-n-tug novels that can certainly get things done. But these books, obviously, aren't literature. There are writers, like Ken Follett , wh \"...being in love was not a steady state, but a matter of fresh surges or waves, and he was experiencing one now.\" -- Ian McEwan, On Chesil Beach Almost no one can write about sex well in my opinion. You've got your erotic writers, fine, if your need for arousal and release comes from text rather than pictures or actual lovers. There are certainly millions of toss-n-tug novels that can certainly get things done. But these books, obviously, aren't literature. There are writers, like Ken Follett , who seem to need to insert sex writing into a novel every 160 - 200 pages just to help drive the novel's narrative forward. Sex in these adventure, mystery, genre novels, etc., acts as almost a sign post or quick reward. \"Congrats, fair reader, you made it to page 320, here is your second sex scene on a road with a monk.\" But as delivered, it all just seems a bit flat and not a little absurd. Now, I'm not saying there isn't good sex writing out there, I have actually come across some. Joyce, Miller, Chopin, and Lawrence all seem to be able to walk that narrow beach of rolling bodies without twisting their ankles on the rocks. They capture the human frailty and power and awkwardness and sensuality of sex without dipping into clich\u00e9 or caricature. I'm not sure why some, few, writers I can handle and most others I just despise. I'm not a prude. I get that sex is a part of life. It isn't icky. I'm not ashamed by it. I realize like food, it is a part of life and thus needs to be represented and shadowed in art and literature. So, with all that baggage and preamble, it was still with quite a bit of trepidation that I slid into Ian McEwan's tight little novella. One reason I think this novel didn't bend me over too much with its very direct narrative about sex was Ian McEwan's mastery of language. He knew exactly what he was doing. He was aiming for an exact mood, a tension, a flick of a finger on a solo hair, an almost anti-climax, to convey the message of this novella. It required a tease, a premature crescendo, and in the end -- the cold, wet, and sticky dialogue of pain and regret. ...more Love lost through an inability to speak truth. It is 1962. Edward and Florence have gone to a lovely seaside hotel on their wedding night, totally unprepared for the actual mechanics of sex. Both are virgins. Both have little knowledge of what can or should be done and the result is not a happy one. Still, the issue here is not about the mores of the 50\u2019s, I believe.

But this is a novel about communication and trust more than about the uptight mores of a bygone time. Ian McEwan - from his website We are shown the history of their relationship via flashback. Florence came from a home bereft of physical contact. There is one scene in which it is intimated, although not conclusively, that her father may have been guilty of a crime against her youth. No wonder she is frightened. Physicality to her is a source of shame. And once given (as when she was cuddled by one of her nannies as a child) the pleasure is soon yanked away. (The nanny was let go) But the crime here is that Edward and Florence are unable to talk with each other about their problem. Had they exercised the power of speech they might have found a way out of their marital jungle. We are shown what the future holds for them. And maybe in that is a message about disparate times. Maybe, even with all the angst of changes over the last 50 years, we are in a better position to address our issues in the 21st century, even despite the divorce rate.

However, as it is short-listed for the Booker, and since I have a tendency to hardly ever keep up with contemporary literature, I was inspired to pick this up at the library yesterday. Then, I proceeded to read it in one sitting. Of course, this rapid reading was very much aided by the length of the book, but this is ultimately an inconsequential reason for my fixation. As with *Ato I hadn't intended on reading any Ian McEwan in the near future, and this wasn't even atop my McEwan \"to-read\" list.

Then, I proceeded to read it in one sitting. Of course, this rapid reading was very much aided by the length of the book, but this is ultimately an inconsequential reason for my fixation. As with *Atonement*, the only other of his I've read, McEwan here displays the most amazing ability to create such honest and well-developed characters, that it is, for me, seemingly impossible not to attach yourself at least somewhat to the \u201ctheir stories\u201d. While I think that *Atonement* is a more developed work\u2014complex and historical, at once youthfully passionate and bitterly resigned\u2014and, thus literarily, impressed me more, *On Chesil Beach* is, for me, much more affecting. This was due, in part, because I was more willing and able to become wholly enmeshed in the text. It also seemed more relevant to my present life, which, though I often shrink from reviews that make such a point, I must admit allowed me to become more invested, more enveloped in McEwan's tale. Though I claim that *Atonement* is more developed, we should remind ourselves that *On Chesil Beach* is a notably shorter work. I'm astounded at McEwan's ability, in such few words, to create complex characters and themes that are not in the least bit inchoate. The only author I know of who can take on such a multitude of themes in such a concise text is J.M. Coetzee, though he is an utterly different writer than McEwan. Whereas Coetzee is focused more on what we might call the social and the universal, McEwan explores the psychological and the individual. And, yet, through the seemingly specific individuals that McEwan creates, we wholly relate, thus imbuing his themes, emotions, ideas with a kind of universality. This work explores, so beautifully, much of what it means to be young, in love, and attempting to assume adulthood and take the first, daunting steps in an attempt to forge a fulfilling life. And, as I read, my heart simply broke. ...more Having only previously read Atonement and Saturday, I was both incredibly reluctant and eager to know what the \u201cliterary device\u201d used in On Chesil Beach was; AKA, why it almost won the Booker Prize.

(Indeed this is the stark opposite of that new classic: it is small where Atonement is enormous and epic, simple while Atonement is complex, and Atonement is a love story while On Chesil Beach is about the absence of that particular element and the end of romance.) But there is also no reason to believe that, while taking on that same theme of crystallization of a particular moment in a human\u2019s life, On Chesil Beach is the trash that Saturday is. That heinous novel, about a pompous neurosurgeon who believes he has literary entitlement just because he can \u201cpredict events\u201d in his neobourgeois life, simply by knowing how the human body works, and dissecting daily minutiae into scientific (therefore, deeply un-poetic) reasoning, playing \u201cGod\u201d--I found it incredibly irritating. Stupid. Especially having had read Atonement and thinking that a writer like McEwan would never dare disappoint the Reader. But after the popularity of the book I keep mentioning, and will continue to mention for time to come (with a strange type of fanboy fervor)-- Atonement-- I guess the author felt it comfortable to come up with simpler stories, perhaps even complete foils of the book that put McEwan at the forefront. The play with time is what McEwan is all about, more than being a romantic, more than being a mod Londoner. And On Chesil Beach succeeds admirably in that aspect. Sure, I could care less about Florence and Edward, their being \u201cvictims of their time\u201d seems at once cliched, even somewhat intolerable. Why should we care about characters that really don\u2019t even know themselves? I find Briony Tallis\u2019s lie much more compelling than this: \u201chow an entire course of a life can be changed--by doing nothing.\u201d (203) This theme of doing nothing, or of active non-action, is a paradigm of most English classics, even modern ones like Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s awesome Never Let Me Go. ...more The Young Man's Ego: A Heartbreaking Torpedo? \"This is how the entire course of a life can be changed: by doing nothing.\" This is my first McEwan novel; it's almost a 5 but not quite. I must say, if this short novel is any indication, McEwan is a master of tightening the circles, bit by bit, to mounting tension and then to the Moment, the place and time when opposing forces collide, when choices must be made, and courses must be altered or not.

I must say, if this short novel is any indication, McEwan is a master of tightening the circles, bit by bit, to mounting tension and then to the Moment, the place and time when opposing forces collide, when choices must be made, and courses must be altered or not. He delicately weaves in the backgrounds of newlyweds Florence, a talented classical string musician, and Edward, a history student without any clear direction for his future but seems earnest nonetheless, as they spend the afternoon and evening of their wedding in a hotel at Chesil Beach on the Dorset seashore. By their backgrounds and internal dialogues on the day of, the reader can see the baggage and expectations each carries: Edward, with his self-centered male ego concerning sex, and Florence, a fear of sex (possibly arising from being sexually abuse as she reached puberty). Use of the term \"possibly\" arises from ambiguities, which must be a McEwan staple in which he intimates but does not say. I was unsure where this would lead, but was awed by McEwan's tightening and fine-tuning tension in the conflict, like the strings on a violin. I enjoyed the novel. I found it rather self-revelatory and poignant and heartrending. Looking back, I detest the male ego I had when I was in my 20s (give or take a few years both ways), when it came to matters of, or relating to, sex. \"It is shaming sometimes, how the body will not, or cannot, lie about emotions.\" ...more I don't know who this story thinks it is is, but it can shove off. It has put me in a bad damn mood and all I wanna do is fight. People are assholes. You know... I just... Ugh...!!!!! I thought this was incredible at the time of reading. It really had a profound effect on me. It's a pretty grim story about what happens when two people who aren't supposed to be together get married. Both are virgins for very different reasons; Edward because he's almost too polite to function and Florence because the idea of sex repulses her. I felt sorry for them both on different levels. On the one hand, I can commiserate and sympathise with Florence's disposition. I think the concept of bei I thought this was incredible at the time of reading. It really had a profound effect on me.

Both are virgins for very different reasons; Edward because he's almost too polite to function and Florence because the idea of sex repulses her. I felt sorry for them both on different levels. On the one hand, I can commiserate and sympathise with Florence's disposition. I think the concept of being an asexual is far more accepted nowadays but it's still taboo. It's like people who don't like to drink alcohol (especially in Ireland); they're constantly bombarded with not just incredulity and peer-pressure but genuine anger and judgement. It's the same with sex. People just don't get it and that must be difficult. By the same token, I also feel sympathy for sweet, polite Edward. He's a dutiful and gentle gentleman who just wants to get laid and was even willing, however daftly, to marry in a hurry for it to happen. The subsequent frustration must have been agonising. And the novel is not just about sex and I apologise if my review seems to mislead you in thinking it is. It's more than that. It's about compatibility, expectations and reality, love and lack of it, individuality and societal pressure to conform. That's what I took from it anyway. I'm a relationship-realist which isn't a thing but I am it if it was a thing. This book reinforces that realism within me that denies me my more romantic self to run away with notions of perfection and destiny and soul-mates. This is a good thing. Low expectations are good. Not low ambitions for what a relationship should be nor low standards as such but low expectations . I'm telling you, it will improve your relationships (romantic and otherwise) tenfold. So yes, I loved this. It's tragic and true and graphic and visceral and depressing and just TOO REAL and also very well written and you should all read it at some point. ...more It took me three years to finish it.

I would have found myself in novella\u2019s last 20 pages and I would have murdered this stunningly doomed book. It\u2019s about our tempered decisions and how they influence us. McEwan\u2019s words have had a huge impact on me and he doesn\u2019t waste them. Tragedies are not always loud. Impatience of the youth often creates an avalanche. And then memories, shame, regret and longing are your new adult companions. ...more \u0391\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1

The fact that she lived in Oxford , was a classical musician , hated pop music , had a distant father , an intellectual mother and lived in upper middle class Summertown are a lazy shorthand to explain her reticence about lurv making . he of course lived outside in the country , geddit , loved rock music ,and had a charmingly chaotic crazy family , is just a normal bloke eager to get his hands on a girl and marriage seemed to only way . that two so disimilar people should be in love at all was totally daft . the author also ruins the scene setting by intruding from his desk and computer to says things like \" this was not a good moment in English cuisine \" , the poor things no ciabbata , so unsophisticated ! Iiving in Oxford i did like the local references but if you lived in Croydon i should not think this meant much . it would just reinforce the idea that everyone in Oxford was called Rupert and cycled everywhere with a basket on his bike . ok some people do . if this was someone's first novel all this would be accepted but as the umpteenth novel from McEwan it all seems very narrow and unreal and superficial , so there !

Ugh. _______________ I am really glad I didn't read this book when I was a kid. If it had existed then and I'd come across it, between On Chesil Beach and Bell Jar I would've almost certainly gotten me to a nunnery, and I'd be there right now (though come to think of it, would that be such a bad thing?). Actually, I think I read this at precisely the right stage of my life. I see that not all the Booksters on here loved it so much, while to me it was just about perfect. So far both McEwan books I've read have dealt with sex and class, but also with this project of looking back at the past and trying to make sense of it, and of the ways we choose to do or not do certain things, at how we make decisions and conduct relationships with one another, and in this fumbling, unguided way wind up doing what it is that makes our lives. McEwan shows us history and the people trapped inside it, and he offers up a counterpoint to the Talking Heads song about days going by with a different view of the mechanics by which we each wind up having lived a certain life.... if that makes any sense, and it probably doesn't the muddled way I've explained it. Well, it does to me, and I actually thought this book accomplished it much more successfully than Atonement, which I also really liked. I think Ian McEwan is a terrific writer. I bet if I'd read him a another point in my life I wouldn't be responding so enthusiastically, but right now his stuff is making a lot of sense to me. I also love that he wrote a short, careful book. More people should do that. Everything doesn't need to be so big and sprawling. An excruciatingly crafted sex scene can be just as impressive as a multigenerational epic, in five hundred fewer pages.

The book was The Child in Time and I had heard of neither the book nor its author before. My friend was right about the book being amazing. I still remember being very impressed by the writing. However, I was devastated by the premise of the novel: the effect on a father of the abduction of his three year old child - so devastated that I decided not to read any more of McEwan's work for fear of being devastated all over again. Fast forward twenty years and a different friend gives me a pile of books as a gift. One of them is On Chesil Beach . I dutifully thank him, knowing all the while that I'll never read it, because it's written by Ian McEwan. The book stays on my bookshelf, though, because it's a gift and disposing of books given as gifts just seems wrong, even if I don't want to read them. So now it's 2012 and the book has been sitting on the shelf for four years, along with a number of other books I've been given or bought and haven't read. I decide to participate in a challenge to read books owned but not read before the beginning of the year. I pick up On Chesil Beach . It's time to get over The Child in Time . This novel tells a deceptively simple tale. It's 1962. Edward and Florence, an intelligent, well-educated young couple, have just married. They are spending the first night of their honeymoon in a hotel on the Dorset coast, overlooking Chesil Beach. Both virgins, they have quite different feelings as they move towards having sex for the first time. What happens on that night is interwoven with flashbacks of their lives and of what has led them to this point. What happens changes their lives forever. I did not find either Edward or Florence to be particularly sympathetic characters. While what happens is both horrifying and funny, I didn't feel fully engaged with either of them as people. However, what I found utterly compelling about the novel is its illustration of how the seemingly small decisions people make and the words spoken or left unsaid can irrevocably change lives. I love McEwan's prose: elegant, clear, economical. I love his re-creation of England and Englishness at the beginning of a decade which was to transform the world. I also love that he managed to say and to imply so much in so few words. I can confidently say that this novel has cured my McEwan phobia. I can finally get around to reading more of his work. ...more OK, seriously, Ian McEwan, you wrote Saturday . Saturday! You wrote f*ing Saturday!

I just want to find these two people (who would be in their 80's now) slap them both in the face and scream \"Get over yourselves!\" This is my third McEwan novel and I loved Saturday best; Atonement was also pretty good. I realize that he writes books where most of the action is in the minds of the characters... that's OK. But this book goes beyond introspective and launches the reader right into disgustingly narcissistic navel-gazing. It's just not healthy. And honestly, Ian McEwan, it's a bit insulting for you to think we actually care what happens to these characters' sex lives once you've revealed them to be the nasty petty selfish things they are. --- PS: OH, and, um thanks for the Christmas present... really, I was going to read it anyway so... :-S PPS: I just saw someone else on Goodreads, giving it a positive review, recommended it for \"those of us who enjoy whining about the complexity of heterosexual relationships these days.\" That is EXACTLY what I'm talking about. ...more Almost A brilliant book, but such a sad one; it would be unfair not to say so up front.

When they fall in love, nurture ambitions, experience happiness, I feel these things too. But when happiness eludes them, the pain is unbearable, not least because the author never lets us forget by how small a margin their happiness was missed. In his last major novel, Saturday , McEwan pulled back from the multi-decade scope of Atonement , its predecessor, choosing to confine himself to the events of a single day. Here, the essential action occupies a mere three hours, described in a book which is itself unusually compact, a mere novella of only 200 delicate pages. In an opening that is surely a homage to Matthew Arnold's \"Dover Beach,\" the new husband and wife sit in a hotel room within sound of the sea on England's South coast. They eat a mediocre meal in one room; in the next, their bed stands waiting. They love each other, there is never any doubt about that, but they are inexperienced and secretly afraid. The book tells how they came to that moment, and what becomes of their love and fears as they move from one room into the other. I have not known McEwan to write before in such detail about sex, but his writing is never prurient. Every detail serves to illustrate the psychological intercourse between these two talented and caring young people. On this particular night, as in a high-stakes game, their honeymoon bed becomes the board upon which all the other pieces of their relationship must be played. By going back to the early 1960s, that dark hour just before the dawn of the sexual revolution, McEwan performs the remarkable feat of undoing the modern liberation of sex from marriage and returning to a mindset in which marriage was not only a contract for sex, but sex might also be a prime reason for marriage. But not the only reason. The focus on the bedroom also makes you consider all the other qualities that these two bring to their marriage, and before long you feel that you know them very well. [Exceptionally well in my case, since I was also born in Britain in the same year (1940), and share qualities with each of them; readers might take this into account when weighing the objectivity of my reactions.] Edward is a bright young man from the country who has recently achieved a first-class academic degree. Florence comes from a more socially sophisticated family, though she herself is naive in most things. The one exception is her calling as a violinist; here as in Saturday , McEwan is extraordinary in his use of music; the sections describing Florence's quartet playing are right up there with Vikram Seth's An Equal Music , my touchstone for sensitive writing about musicians. So both are bright, both are talented, both feel the stirring of new possibilities, but there are big differences between them, socially and culturally (Edward, for example, is into rock), and they each want different things. But the most heartbreaking things in this book are not their differences, but how often and how close they come to making new connections; just an inch more, a moment longer, and everything might be all right\u2026. Almost. But McEwan does not end the story in the bedroom or on the beach below. Much as in Atonement , though in only a few pages, he adds an epilogue continuing the story forward several decades. At the time, I felt it was too brief to settle all the emotions stirred up by the preceding pages, but now as I write, several hours after closing the book, I begin to see its rightness and appreciate its consolation. ...more This is a relatively short novel (just over 200 pages), but it carries quite a devastating emotional punch, particularly in its final chapters. McEwan's story concerns a newly married young couple in the early 1960's, neither of whom are sexually experienced.

McEwan's story concerns a newly married young couple in the early 1960's, neither of whom are sexually experienced. Edward looks forward to the societal license granted to him by his wedding to act on his physical impulses; Florence's love for Edward is honest, but the wedding night looms in her imagination like an unpleasant chore. McEwan follows this couple as they arrive in their honeymoon suite and pares apart their respective emotional histories with an almost cold precision. Edward and Florence live just on the edge of the massive cultural changes of the mid-1960's; Florence, for example, anticipates a successful career with her string quartet and politely tolerates Edward's fondness for Chuck Berry and early rock & roll: \"When the tunes were so elementary, mostly in simple four-four time, why this relentless thumping and crashing and clattering to keep time? What was the point, when there was already a rhythm guitar, and often a piano?\" Different taste in music is probably the least of this couple's trouble, but McEwan uses this polite disagreement (\"He kissed her and told her she was the squarest person in all of Western civilization.\") as an indicator of future divergencies. The literally climactic scene of the wedding consummation reads at first like slapstick, but McEwan's precise delving into Edward's and Florence's internal dialogue makes it tragic. The novel turns entirely on the reader's acceptance of this scene, and McEwan's blend of emotional and physical detail is flawless. It's a scene that would only be lessened by paraphrase (or a filmed interpretation, for that matter). McEwan's skill is to use these two characters, neither of which is ultimately very likeable, to offer a subtle indication of what the convulsive societal shifts of the 1960s freed us from and, more important, to demonstrate how \"by doing nothing. . . the entire course of a life can be changed.\" By the end of the novel, it's not just the characters who feel the chill winds off the beach. The clumsy fumbling of a newly married couple is not unknown to me. Nor is the frustration of a young man whose partner is less experienced than he. This is McEwan's starting point, and perhaps one that elicits easy empathy, but by the time the full consequences of this young couple's inexperience become evident, the reader is almost divided in their loyalties (or pity) for the characters. More so than other McEwan novels I've read, On Chesil Beach carries a direct moralistic tone, one that would seem chiding in the hands of a lesser stylist. The beauty of McEwan's language, the patience of his narrative voice as he outlines the tangled emotional backgrounds of his characters, and the sense of omniscient pity he uses to instruct us are Hardy-esque. The impact of this small novel is heartbreaking and cold. ...more A dud if ever there was one....

In 1962 Edward and Florence are between their wedding day and first night together. They are deeply in love but know next to nothing about each other. In that sense, the book could be about any age; what sets it firmly in 1962** (or really in any age up till then \u2013 it feels particularly Edwardian too) is that they are still virgins, and the sexual accident and misunderstanding that happens that evening would now have occurred much earlier in their lives. So Edward is mortified and desperate to find fault; Florence is appalled and disgusted, her suppressed fears have come true, and she can\u2019t stay in the room with him any longer. For a while at least, she needs to be alone. But what happens afterwards is timeless, really. It doesn\u2019t matter what the trigger was, these two are polite to a fault, but strangers to each other. You want to scream \u201coh, just say you\u2019re sorry! That it will all get better!\u201d But of course neither of them can; they\u2019re trapped in their own fear, anger, hurt pride, and embarrassment; and they part. The last few pages follow Edward\u2019s later life where there is more than a hint of regret. And the point of the novel is, as Edward discovers (now, some forty years later), when he at last can admit that Florence was the one he had loved most in his life, that \u201cthis is how the entire course of a life can be changed\u2014by doing nothing.\u201d But this of course is only Edward\u2019s voice, and I wonder if that is actually the message: after all Edward didn\u2019t do \u201cnothing\u201d ... he hurled the ultimate insults of the \u201860s \u2013 frigid and bitch ; after which there could perhaps be no reconciliation. About Florence\u2019s later life, we learn little except that her string quartet did become successful and famous; perhaps she had no regrets at all. I think the real message is that being deeply in love is not enough; it can take a lifetime to know someone. Memorable quotes: \"This was not a good moment in the history of English cuisine, but no one much minded at the time, except visitors from abroad.\" \"On Chesil Beach he could have called out to Florence, he could have gone after her. He did not know, or would not have cared to know, that as she ran away from him, certain in her distress that she was about to lose him, she had never loved him more, or more hopelessly, and that the sound of his voice would have been a deliverance, and she would have turned back. Instead, he stood in cold and righteous silence in the summer\u2019s dusk\" \"\u201cYou\u2019re a bitch talking like that.\u201d The word was a starburst in the night sky. Now she could say what she liked.\" \"Edward took the next steps with fatal ease: she had known all this\u2014how could she not?\u2014and she had deceived him. She wanted a husband for the sake of respectability, or to please her parents, or because it was what everyone did. Or she thought it was a marvelous game. She did not love him, she could not love in the way that men and women loved, and she knew this and kept it from him. She was dishonest.\" \"It is not easy to pursue such hard truths in bare feet and underpants.\" ** this is not exactly relevant, but it reminds me of Philip Larkin\u2019s Annus Mirabilis: Sexual

Almost a novella, the writing is so precise and evocative and meaningful that it takes virtually no time to read at all. I read \"Atonement,\" also by Ian McEwan, a few years ago and enjoyed it very much; the same dark perspective on human relations and keen insight into behavior and the inner life is at work here. The book is \"just\" a study of a young couple\u2019s wedding night in England, 1962. We learn about bride and groom in turn, peering briefly but pointedly into each family, assembling just enough pieces to understand and appreciate the inevitability of the book\u2019s tragedy. The plot\u2019s not central here \u2013 though the final chapter I found as suspenseful and gripping as anything I\u2019ve read recently \u2013 rather, the careful observations of two characters at an intersection in their lives, at a time of intersection and change in the world, create all the drama and tragedy one could ask for. The power of language, naming, and words takes on huge importance in the book, and interestingly enough, that power is a force for good and ill, but mostly ill. So often the \"power of language\" takes on a heroic role in contemporary fiction (one would expect contemporary writers to place such an importance on their stock in trade), yet in \"On Chesil Beach\" most of the labels and names and many singular words have terrible consequences. Fascinating, surely, to see the power of language to destroy and damage instead of elevate and enlighten or redeem. In fairness, it is often the lack of appropriate words that bring about disaster: \u201c...there existed no shared language in which two sane adults could describe such events to each other\u201d (169-170). But at the same time, plenty of words, especially labels, do enormous harm in the course of the text. Ultimately \"On Chesil Beach\" is an absolutely beautiful book: emotional, truthful, and as rigorous in its writing as poetry. Truly, no paragraph, sentence, or even word goes to waste. The meticulous descriptions of the main characters' interactions took me aback \u2013 I felt huge sympathy and sadness for Edward and Florence, and absolutely understood all their actions and missteps. These felt like utterly real people, in a completely real situation, saying and doing the things I could imagine myself doing and saying in just such a scenario. It was uncanny, flawless, and truly impressive. ...more", "Title": "On Chesil Beach"},
