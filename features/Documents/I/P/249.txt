You see, I\u2019ve read quite a few high fantasy books with legitimate badass assassins. Ones that are so creepy, so deviously manipulative and intelligent that they make this chick look like a vacuous nitwit in comparison. Maybe my expectations were too high. Then again\u2026maybe not. So, this Celaena chick was apparently the realm\u2019s most feared and reviled assassin at the ripe old age of seventeen. She ends up getting caught though, and enslaved. A year later she\u2019s pulled from the salt mines by the crown prince and put into a competition to determine the most badass of the badass. She's been doing nothing but hauling salt for a year so you think that she\u2019d be busting her butt to get prepared for this assassin competition that she knows nothing about,<---M> right? Maybe practice her aim</---M>, do some push-ups or sit-ups, stretch, meditate, etc? WRONG. Instead, she wanders her rooms, admires her pretty dress in the mirror, contemplates playing the piano, daydreams about the library she just visited and then finally, she sends the crown prince a letter begging for something to read. Yup, she spends the night before a competition that could free her if she wins, or send her back to slavery and death if she loses, READING. FYI, I made it a hundred and fifty pages and these are only the beginning of my complaints. So I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t with this fucking idiot. I\u2019ve heard that the second book is much better so maybe I\u2019ll come back to this when I have more patience. But for now: DNF . This review can also be found on The Book Eaters .

I feel like these covers portray two very different extremes, and Celaena seemed to possess a quality from each of them. That's actually what I loved about her. She's fast becoming one of my all-time favorite YA heroines. I'll admit that a long while ago, I hadn't expected the book to be this good. But as soon as I read the prequels, I fell in love, and I definitely have high hopes for this series. ...more Caleana Sardothien, young woman assassin, is betrayed and sentenced to the salt mines of Endovier.

I will be doing a full video review of this soon, so look forward to more of my thoughts then :) Are you kidding me? What the hell is this shit? How do you screw up your story quite so badly after starting from an INCREDIBLE premise involving the most notorious assassin in the land - now a slave - being offered the chance to win back her freedom, sort of, in a \"to-the-death tournament - fighting the most gifted thieves and assassins in the land\" [says the back of my book, conveniently forgetting that (a) right before the final duels, the king specifically states that the competitors \"can wi Are you kidding me?

I mean, you really have to be TALENTED to go from all of *that* Exciting Sounding Awesomeness to - well - to <+++>Throne of Glass</+++> . After reading the Q & A included in the back of my book, though, it all started to make sense, and I wish I'd known before buying this stupid-ass book that it's inspired by DISNEY'S CINDERELLA , of all things. I know what you're thinking: Where the fridge tart does Cinderella come in? Isn't this story about, like, a TOUGH-AS-NAILS former-assassin-now-slave competing for her life in, like, the most badass tournament ever ? Well ... actually, no. And I'm happy to spend the next few hours of my life quoting this most dumbass book if it means AT LEAST ONE PERSON might decide not to waste their money on it, no need to thank me. '\"Wake up.\" Not surprisingly, it was Chaol. She shimmied beneath the blankets, pulling them over her head, but he grabbed the covers and threw them to the floor. Her nightgown was wrapped around her thighs. Celaena shivered. \"It's cold,\" she moaned, holding her knees to her body. She didn't care that she had only a few months to beat the other Champions - she needed sleep . [Nope, this isn't your bratty kid sister, but the most notorious assassin EVAH! You know, the one who - after slaving away in the salt mines for four months - was so desperate to escape that she even tried a mad suicide dash. What the hell, though; they're only offering her her freedom .] It would have been nice if the Crown Prince had considered springing her from Endovier earlier so she could have some time to regain her strength; how long had he known about this competition, anyway? [Sheesh. I know, right? Silly Crown Prince, not considering the feelings of, like, one of the most terrible criminals his men have ever captured. I mean, he gives you large, comfortable living quarters in his castle, a billiards table, a chance to change your life, even a puppy , and - what - he thinks this is enough?!] \"Get up.\" Chaol ripped the pillows from beneath her head. \"Now you're wasting my time.\" If he noticed how much skin she was showing, he didn't react. [That wasn't irrelevant at all ... ] Grumbling, Celaena slithered to the edge of the bed, dangling a hand over the edge to touch the floor. \"Fetch my slippers,\" she mumbled. \"The floor's like ice.\" [Yeah, put those servants in their place , Cinderella !] ... From the doorway, Chaol asked, \"Why, might I ask, are you so tired?\" She gulped down the rest of the pomegranate juice and wiped her mouth on a napkin. \"I was up until four reading,\" she said.' [Why do you even have to ask, Chaol? It's only the start of the tournament of Celaena's life; of course she stayed up all night reading. SLEEP WHEN YOU'RE DEAD, YO!! If the competition barely merits any page time, why should the competitors actually give a shit about it?!] 'A few minutes later, Celaena frowned at herself as she hurried after the captain into the foyer. \"I look ridiculous! These pants are absurd, and this shirt is awful.\"' [Way to be descriptive , Cinderella ! Generic complaints FTW! It's not like you've been slaving in the salt mines for a year, or anything like that, OF COURSE YOUR CLOTHES MATTER and HOW DARE THEY?! DON'T LET THE BASTARDS GRIND YOU DOWN!!?!!?!!] '\"You expect me to use a mace an hour after sunrise?\"' [The horror!] 'She bit into an apple. It was tart, with a sweet, honey-like aftertaste. \"Oh? And what books do you love?\" He named a few, and she blinked. \"Well, those are good choices - for the most part. What others?\" she asked, and somehow, an hour flew by, carrying them on the wings of conversation.' [Jesus. This paragraph isn't a pointless waste of space at all.] 'There was something girlish about her, too. Oh, he couldn't stand her contradictions!' [INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS!!! Because *my* Chaol doesn't have a va-jay-jay ... ] 'Celaena bit down her laugh. Archery? It was an archery contest?' [Yeah, that was my reaction, too ... ] 'Pelor, the gangly assassin, wasn't yet strong enough to manage a longbow, and barely made any shots. When he finished, his eyes gleaming with resentment, the Champions sniggered, and Cain laughed the loudest. ... Despite herself, Celaena felt badly for the boy. His shots hadn't been that bad.' [Yeesh! If barely making any shots isn't *that* bad, I can see how CINDERBRAT is the world's scariest assassin.] '\"Why would she kill me? I think she likes being pampered. [*snort*] If she hasn't attempted to escape or kill anyone, then why would she do it now?\" He patted his friend on the shoulder. \"You worry too much.\"' [ZOMG! U NVR HERD OF BIDING UR TIME B4? This Crown Prince is clearly not the brightest crayon in the box.] 'Sam. What would he make of all this?' [Since he's never been mentioned before, I really can't say. Sorry.] 'Dorian peeled himself from the wall. For all her assassinating experience, she didn't notice him until he sat down on the bench beside her.' [Yeah, I can see why she's Most Baddest Assassinator EVAH! And who glued you to the wall, anyway, Crown Douche Bag?] '\"No. I can survive well enough on my own - if given proper reading material.\" He looked at the fire, trying not to think about where she'd been only weeks before - and what that kind of loneliness might have felt like. There were no books in Endovier.' [I find it hard to believe that loneliness is your biggest problem when you're a beautiful seventeen-year-old girl slaving away in a salt mine, but ... what do I know? A BOOK!! A BOOK!! MY KINGDOM FOR A BOOK!!!! ] 'It wasn't until later that Philippa brought the news. The Champion who hadn't shown up for the Test had been found dead in a servant's stairwell, brutally mauled and dismembered. The new murder cast a pall over the next two weeks, and the two Tests they brought with them. Celaena passed the Tests - stealth and tracking - without drawing much attention to herself or risking her neck to save anyone.' [When your plot's so boring that you're summarizing it all, you've got a problem ... ] 'He remained in the doorway, fearful that she'd wake up if he took another step. Some assassin. She hadn't even bothered to stir.' [I know, right? Also, you're a stalking stalker, Crown Douche Bag!] 'She smiled at the young chevaliers they passed - and smirked at the court women who eyed her pink-and-white gown. She couldn't blame them; the dress was spectacular. And she was spectacular in it.' [Bloody hell, you'd think a year of slavery would knock the vanity right out of a girl ... ] 'The assassin pivoted around the table and took aim again. She missed. Gritting her teeth, she considered snapping the cue in half across her knee. But she'd been attempting to play for only an hour. She'd be incredible by midnight! She'd master this ridiculous game or she'd turn the table into firewood.' [Now, now, CINDERBRAT . Temper tantrums are, like, so unbecoming.] '\"For the world's greatest assassin, this is pathetic,\" said Dorian, stepping from the doorway.' [Because assassins are widely known to be proficient at billiards. What, you didn't know??] 'She had often wished for adventure.' [If you spend seven years as an assassin and somehow manage not to stumble headfirst into all sorts of adventures, you're probably not doing it right .] 'So she'd cheated a little, but she'd won.' [LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HOLD ON TO YOUR SEATS; WE'VE JUST HAD OUR FIRST GLIMPSE OF CELAENA ACTUALLY BEHAVING REMOTELY LIKE AN ASSASSIN!!!! And it's only page 240 ... ] 'It had been over three weeks since her last encounter with Elena, and she hadn't seen or heard her at all, despite the three Tests she'd had, the most exciting of which being an obstacle course, which she passed with only a few minor scratches and bruises. Unfortunately, Pelor hadn't done so well, and had been sent home at long last. But he'd been lucky: three other competitors had died. All found in forgotten [well, obviously not that forgotten] hallways; all mutilated beyond recognition.' [The plot overload! It's ... it's ... positively ... unbearable ... ] 'Amidst her worrying, another Test passed without incident or embarrassment - though she couldn't say the same for the soldier who'd been sent home - and she kept up her intense training with Chaol and the other Champions.' [WOW: So Much Story! How can I process it all?] '\"Candy!\" A large paper bag sat on a pillow, and she found that it was filled with all sorts of confectionary goodies. There was no note, not even a name scribbled on the bag. With a shrug and glowing eyes, Celaena pulled out a handful of sweets. Oh, how she adored candy! Celaena issued a jolly laugh and crammed some of the candy into her mouth. ... \"Someone,\" she said in between chews, \"is very good to me.\"' [I just ... oh God ... I have no words! :D Cookie Monster strikes again?] '\"Of course I want her,\" Celaena said, then realized what the implications would be. \"But I want her trained. I don't want her urinating on everything and chewing on furniture and shoes and books. And I want her to sit when I tell her to and lay down and roll over and whatever it is that dogs do. And I want her to run - run with the other dogs when they're practicing. I want her to put those long legs to use.\" Dorian crossed his arms as Celaena scooped up the dog. \"That's a long list of demands. Perhaps I should have bought you jewelry after all.\" [Hold your puppies, Dorian, CINDERDIVA STILL isn't done.] \"When I'm training\" - she kissed the pup's soft head, and the dog nestled her cold nose against Celaena's neck - \"I want her in the kennels, training as well. When I return in the afternoon, she may be brought to me. I'll keep her in the night.\" Celaena held the dog at eye level. The dog kicked her legs in the air. \"If you ruin any of my shoes,\" she said to the pup, \"I'll turn you into a pair of slippers. Understood?\"' [Jesus Christ. Is it bad that what *I* want is for someone to rend Celaena limb from limb? And why does she have a bunch of shoes, anyway? Am I the only one who remembers that she's a fucking FORMER-ASSASSIN-NOW-SLAVE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!] 'Philippa huffed. \"Just don't tell them I helped you when you get dragged back here.\"' [Sure, because if Celaena says nothing, they'll probably assume it was one of her other, non-existent maids who helped her navigate her way into her dress.] 'Frowning, Chaol watched his friend dance with the assassin. He wouldn't have danced with her, anyway. And he was glad he hadn't worked up the nerve to ask her, not after seeing the color that Duke Perrington's face turned upon discovering the pair.' [WTF is the author Chaol talking about? What actually happens five minutes prior to this is that Celaena asks him to dance and he says no. Also, this guy's kind of a wussy-with-a-\"p\" for a Captain of the Guard. He's never even killed anyone before. Yeesh. Captain of the Guard, my foot.] ' ... Cain was little more than a pawn in a game to amuse the king ... ' [That's what they keep saying, but the king isn't even present in the castle for the majority of the competition, so ... ] Oh, one more thing: THE NAMES! How the heck do you pronounce Chaol? Kale? Like the cabbage? And Kaltain Rompier has to be one of the stupidest names I've EVER come across. It makes me think of frolicking unicorns, or ... something. As for the main character, well, I don't even know what to call her. Selena? Kay-lay-na? (that's the one I eventually settled on, after spending half the book mentally mumbling her name) I mean, what in Erilea kind of a name is Celaena? Is it really any wonder that Nehemia eventually renames her?! Other people get normal enough names, such as Dorian and Grave and Sam and Elena and Xavier and Cain and Philippa and Verin and Ned; simple names, really. I guess the special snowflake needs a special name to go with her very special personality impairment. Don't even try to get me started on the place names, because I tuned them out after Eyllwe, so I have no idea how these countries / lands / coffee beans relate to one another, but I'll probably live. And what is even the point of the glass castle? Or the non-existent throne of glass that the book's apparently named after? Thinly-veiled CINDERELLA references FTW!!!! If you ask me, the author should have gone for Cinderella in Candyfloss Land! , because you certainly don't get much more than that. I don't even know what Celaena spends most of the second half of the book doing. The tournament trials and murders are mentioned in passing here and there ( Yesterday we threw knives! Another three people were eaten over the past three weeks! ) and the book focuses on - I don't know what - Celaena sitting in her room, Celaena fawning over herself in front of one mirror or another, Celaena boasting about her amazing assassin skills that you'd otherwise never know she had, Celaena going for walks, Celaena admiring pouffalicious dresses, Cinderella Celaena wishing someone would invite her to the ball, Celaena eating sweets, Evil King being evil, and Frolicking Unicorn being high. It's ... exciting stuff. Really. Also, since when do slaves have possessions? Why does some random slave (who immediately gets murdered by some random people, so yay for the Drama Llama) have enough salve to pass around as required? Who makes this salve? From what? Who are these slaves allowed to associate with that they can procure salve? What do they trade for this salve? Their bodies? Their hair? Salt they've squirrelled away from the mines? Yeesh! Explain yourself, <---A>Sarah J. Maas</---A>! UGH! Terrible, terrible, horrendous. Nonsensical, stupid, pointless. Fluffy, pathetic, ridiculous. Need I say more? Really? Need I? <+++>Throne of Glass</+++> tries to emulate Poison Study ... and fails ... spectacularly . Save yourself the torture and go straight for Poison Study . If you've already read Posion Study , read it again. Or try Graceling . Just ... don't say I didn't warn you. ...more I DID IT!!! OMFFFFFFG! THIS BOOK WAS JUST SO F****** GOOD!

But she's a girl and now her story is being over-looked because, instead of drowning in self-pity, she decides to stand up, throw her hair over her shoulder and say \"screw the world, I'm gonna survive.\" I admire her for not letting her time in Endovier break her. How many books have you read with an author spending a dominant part of the plot trying to pry away the pity in the heart of her damaged characters, yeah, that's right, almost every time . They're usually so engrossed with whatever they did or whatever they went through, they bury themselves in their past and drown themselves in their own sympathy that it's actually ridiculous. But Celaena isn't like that and she's getting hate for it. Celaena aside, Dorian was okay, I've got no rotten points to divulge about him. I would, however, like to see his character develop further, because right now he's; [x] Not what he seems [x] Doesn't like being a prince [x] Insanely good-looking [x] Has daddy issues. (never forget the daddy issues) And these are such stereotypical characteristics of a YA Prince. Dorian is charming in a boyish non-arrogant way. He makes Celaena smile and is an all-around good guy. And he loves books. Those are always plus points in my book. I don't really know what to think about Chaol, at this point, he's still a raw character, not entirely cooked enough to be eaten (what?). Sometimes he's so frustrating, other times he's so adorable I want to hug him. Right now, I've already read The Assasin's Blade and Crown of Midnight, I'm also halfway through an ARC of Heir of Fire and I can confidently say that if you give this series a fair shot (and Celaena too) then you'll see what I love so much about it. Just so you know : I've never completely disregarded major negative points in a series before, so much so that I still gave it 5 stars. and I am not going to deny that Throne of Glass deserves its varied ratings. But I love Throne of Glass for reasons of my own, I'm not reviewing this for some publisher, so I'm letting you know now , my views are biased . I empathise with Celaena on so many levels, it's almost like we're the same person when I read the books, so with that, I've grown attached to the series as well. ...more Sorry, but it looks like I've been excited for NOTHING.

Having been excited for this novel for weeks and actually liking the sample I read, I have been brought back to earth now \u2013 with a jolt. This YA fantasy is a rather sorry example of its genre. I have the notion that a big part of this book did not work for me because of its heroine. Celeana is smart, athletic, talented and beautiful. She loves music and reading. She is fluent in different languages. She is great. And she knows it. And rubs it in your face repeatedly. As do her suitors and admirers. I had the feeling that Sarah J. Maas tried everything to make me love her heroine. How do you make readers love someone? Present them with a book lover! But somehow, she accomplished the opposite. I did not loathe Celaena, but she grated on my nerves. I wished someone would tell her off, would for once not grant her every wish; I wished the characters I liked would not fall for her charms and good looks. The little romance Celaena had (I won't say with whom) was laughable at best and mostly resulted in me rolling my eyes at the fact that the only attraction that existed between those two stemmed from them both being beautiful. In terms of plot, I cannot deny that there was always a level of suspense present. I did want to know how this story ended, and yes, there were actually parts when I feared the whole thing would not end well \u2013 partly because my beloved heroine did not deem it necessary to inform certain people about what she had witnessed in the castle. Overall, though, the story remained a tad too juvenile and simple for me. Important events were mentioned only in passing and the mythology did not go any further than what was important for the main story line. Many things remained unsaid \u2013 doubtlessly for the sake of sequels yet to come \u2013 but it was not the subtle way of remaining unsaid but hinted at I love in fantasy novels, it felt more like remaining unsaid to lure me into reading on. There were aspects I liked - Celaena's friendship to Nehemia, the Eyllwe princess, and Chaol, the loyal and fierce captain of the guard \u2013 but in the end, there isn't enough to make me interested in reading any sequels. In short - what I wanted: A less is more mentality. World building that does not only cover what is necessary to follow the main story arc. Subtle romance. Villains in different shades of grey. Assassins that actually assassinate. And do not only sit in their room talking or thinking about clothes and boys. What I got: A vain and mostly unlikeable heroine. Two men absolutely bedazzled by her presence. Hints of a love triangle. Lots and lots of descriptions of clothing. Flimsy world building. An overall poor execution writing-wise. Thank you. Next?

But it'd be nice if she could actually prove it because from what I've seen, she's once hell of a crappy assassin. People walk in and out of her room all the time when she's sleeping and she just keeps on snoring. Hello, aren't you supposed to spring awake like a ninja and hold a knife to that person's throat? That's what I expect from someone who just left a death camp. Instead I get this. The real clincher is what I call the 'Candy Incident'. There's a bag of candy left on Calaena's bed with no note or anything. This is during the period where a murderer is going around killing Champions and a couple have died already. And what does the 'greatest assassin in the world do? She gobbles them up immediately, going Oh, how I adored candies! Remember that episode in Avatar: the Last Airbender when Sokka drinks cactus juice and gets all high? Then, it wears off and this happens: Couldn't have said it better myself, Katara. Calaena is the kind of idiot that licks stuff off walls, even without the hallucinatory assistance of cactus juice. But wait, there's more! Nothing happens to her because she's purrrfect and fabulous, like that song from High School Musical. In fact, I'm pretty sure she's a Mary Sue. Let's check off her traits, shall we? Tragic past, check. Pretty, check. Amazingly good at something, check. Has more than one love interest, check. Don't even get me started on the love interests. There is absolutely no difference between Dorian and Chaol except for the fact that I'm more leery of the name Dorian. Maybe it's because I just recently finished The Picture of Dorian Gray so whenever I see his name, I think of this: It could be me but then again, you wouldn't name your kid Lolita, would you? And the ending (view spoiler) [where Calaena breaks up with Dorian because she's the King's Champion and it would be inappropriate ? We all know it's a ploy to squeeze in some kissy-kissy time with Chaol in the next book. And by being single , she doesn't look like a cheater. (hide spoiler) ] On a side note, I saw this took 10 years to write because it was originally published on FictionPress.net or something. Seriously? It took George. R. R.

The reviews and ratings from my GR friends on this book are very mixed and I can easily see why after finishing this entertaining but disappointingly tame and romance-y young adult fantasy. Throne of Glass is like Shadow and Bone round two. The premise is awesome for both: full of hardcore warriors/assassins, royal/noble secrets and scandals, a touch of magic... but each one, though entertaining, quickly hangs up its weapons and becomes far more concerned with dresses, bitchiness and whether or not that sexy dude thinks the MC is hot (he does). This book is to the fantasy genre what Twilight is to vampires; though I have to stress that it is a fast-paced, compelling read and Maas does tame fantasy as well as it can be done. Despite my frequent eyerolls and disappointment at the romantic turn the story took, the pages seemed to fly by. I tend to read several books at once; I'll spend a few chapters with one and then mix it up by moving on to another, but Throne of Glass managed to hold my attention from start to finish with no time for interference from another book. This, in itself, was quite an achievement. Celaena Sardothien is the star of this show. A former assassin turned prisoner, she spends every day in the salt mines prison of Endovier. Having given up on hoping for freedom, she wishes only for death. That is, until one day The Crown Prince (Dorian) and his Captain of the Guard (Chaol) arrive with a proposition for her - fight in a competition, win, become the King's Champion for four years, and finally earn her freedom. It's an offer Celaena can't refuse. But, of course, things aren't that simple. Some dark evil is at work inside the King's castle; something that is killing off the competitors one by one. Plus, there's the handsome Prince and moody Captain to deal with too. I don't think Celaena is in the King's palace for a day before she starts obsessing over her looks, her new dresses and whether or not either or both of the aforementioned men find her attractive. She still manages to have more badassery than Alina in Shadow and Bone and the book is, in my opinion, nowhere near as boring as Grave Mercy . But, still, I couldn't help being like \"BUT you said ASSASSIN!\" when she's there swanning around in front of the mirror. I like that she's \"feminine\" (whatever you want to take that to mean) as well as a brutal killer, but there's only so much high school changing rooms behaviour I can take. I think there's an excellent quote, a question that Celaena wonders to herself, that basically sums up what was running through my head for a lot of this novel: \"How had she gone from the most feared prisoner in Endovier to this sappy mess?\" How, indeed. But, that being said, I really enjoyed the banter between her and Chaol. And Dorian wasn't bad either. I've said it before but I'll say it again for the benefit of this review: I actually don't mind love triangles when they're convincing and both candidates for the MC's heart are on equal footing so there's some tension over who they're going to end up with. Though I may have to do all kinds of evil things - like... stomping around my bedroom angrily or letting library books become overdue - if Celaena doesn't end up with Chaol. Ms Maas, you've been warned. So, yes, I will be reading Crown of Midnight , god help me. I'm hoping it will please me more than the sequel to Shadow and Bone did, but the ending of this does make me think the second book could have more action and nastiness (yes!). I think you can enjoy this book if you go into it knowing exactly what you're letting yourself in for. It isn't high fantasy. It isn't mind-blowing. But it is kinda fun *grins* ...more This book was sooooo goood! The main female character is amazing, SHE WAS PRACTICAL. Not to mention completely badass, and could kill anyone with a hairpin if she wanted to. Great high fantasy, i cannot wait for the next in the series! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

That by no means makes this a bad book, because despite those annoyances, I was fully engrossed in Throne of Glass. The Plot and Writing: While the synopsis may come off feeling a little Hunger Game-esque, let me calm your fears now. It's not. Celaena is a young assassin who begins the book being dragged from her prison in Endovier, a salt mine prison for criminals. She's given a choice to become the king's champion (or lackey) for four years in exchange for her freedom at the end of her service. The catch is she must compete for the \"honor\" against other criminals. Sounds easy, right? Of course. Then people start dying, ahem, mysteriously! With that small description the plot sounds like a winner, but I found it to be very predictable. I knew who the villain was and the foreshadowing was not subtle at all. At one point, Maas does try to steer the reader in another direction, but I knew it was just that, a distraction. But regardless, I couldn't deny that it was an exciting read. It's kinda like this: I knew how things probably would end, but I still ended up having fun along the way. Even with it being a little over 400 pages long, it certainly doesn't read like that. The narration is set at a good pace and flows very nicely. The only thing I have to say about the writing style was that at times it felt a wee bit cheesy. There were a few lines like \"Oh and she simply adored...\" or \"Oh how she loved candy!\" that made me cock an eyebrow, but thankfully they were few and far between. Characters: There's nothing I love more than a strong female character who speaks her mind and gives an entire male cast of characters a run for their hard-earned, cash money. Throne of Glass is being marketed as the teen girl version of Game of Thrones. Now, I've never read the books or seen the TV show, but I've heard enough about the depiction and treatment of woman in that series to say it's probably not for me. However, this is where Throne of Glass excels. Not only does it present a strong female MC, but a another secondary character, Nehemia, who also happens to be a person of color. Oh, yes, you read that right. No, ridiculous, over stereotyped, token character here! Because you know, if there is one thing that irritates me the most, it's misrepresentation in YA novels. But that didn't happen here. Nehemia is strong, incredibly smart and underestimated (of course) by everyone at court because of her nationality. Their mistake! I pity the fool who finds their self on the other end of her staff. It won't be pretty. Beautiful chaos. I'm hoping we get to see a lot more of her in the series. ;D As for Celaena, well, she and I had this love/hate relationship going on. I find it really interesting and smart for Maas to create a character who is almost the opposite from what her society expects of her. They expect a proper lady, who never swears, has proper manners, reads poetry, quiet, ect. But Celaena is none of those things. \u00a0Early on it's established that she dislikes the social expectations and makes it a point to use profanity and to embarrass the man folk with her readings of \"Sunset's Passions\". Seriously, she was owning these guys left and right. \"By the Wyrd! Do you actually read this rubbish? What happened to Symbols and Power and Eyllwe Customs and Culture? \" She finished her drink, the ginger tea easing her stomach. \"You may borrow it when I'm done. If you read it, your literary experience will be complete. And,\" she added with a coy smile, \"it will give you some creative ideas of things to do with your lady friends.\" I mean, can we all say, \"In YO face.\" \"Here's a lesson for you, Weapons Master,\" she said, stalking past him. \"Give me real men to fight. Then maybe I'll bother trying.\" And her witty lines only get better and better from there. But of course, with all the pwning going on, she had her faults with being arrogant. Very, very arrogant. And that is where the hate comes into play. She was just too good and from the very beginning I knew Celaena would triumph because she is depicted as slightly Mary-Sueish. She's a well known assassin that can seemingly not be defeated and all man-folk fawn over her left and right. And that bothered me because it felt like there was so much more to her. The Triangle of Love: I was warned that this book contained a love triangle and this alone is enough to make me cringe. There are very few love triangles that I love and unfortunately this isn't one of them. \u00a0When Celaena arrives at Rifthold she is drawn to both the Captain of the Guard, Chaol Westfall, and the Crowned Prince, Dorian Havillard. Oddly, it's not because the characters aren't likable enough together and it's not even the fact of one of the love interests treating her wrongly. The problem I had was Dorian and Celaena's attraction. Most of the time it felt forced, awkward and contrived. I couldn't understand where they had the time to get to know each other long enough for her to stop hating him BEFORE she started liking him. There was even a scene where Dorian promises Celaena that he won't kill one of his new pups that he deemed untrainable. And she goes, \"You'd do that for me?\" I swear I could FEEL her eyelashes batting at him at that very moment. I think that was supposed to make me like Dorian, but all I could do was roll my eyes. Contrastingly, Chaol's seemed like a much more developed and realistic relationship, if you even want to call it that. But their feelings felt more organic.\u00a0Side note: I don't know if this is even considered a love triangle yet. It reminds me of the whole Jacob vs. Edward. We all knew Bella would pick Edward in the end. Was Jake ever a real contender? I think not. But from what I hear from readers of the original story on Fiction Press, Celaena had quite a few suiters. It'll be interesting to see how Throne of Glass deviates from its roots. So, I suppose we will just have to wait for future installments to find out. All in all, though it was not what I was expecting, I still enjoyed Throne of Glass. I really believe it will appeal to many young girls and I'm happy to see great examples of strong female characters in a YA novel. It feels like the sequel can only get better from here based on that ending (no cliffhanger, thank goodness!) and I, like many others, eagerly await book two.

I BLAME YOU, ROBIN. *grumbles* Reviewed by: Rabid Reads The first time I saw my sister after I finished reading Throne of Glass by Sarah J. Maas, she was in the middle of reading the latest book from one of her favorite series. I did not care. I pestered, cajoled, and harassed her until she downloaded the Throne of Glass sample chapters and read them. She stopped reading her book and read mine until the wee morning hours when she finished it. *lap of victory* A few months later, my mom came to visit for a long weekend. Her first night here, she asked me for something to read. I gave her Throne of Glass . She stayed two extra hours to finish it. My MOTHER. (True friggin\u2019 story). And they aren\u2019t the only ones I\u2019ve pushed/thrown/shoved Throne of Glass at. Why? Because it\u2019s STUPENDOUS, that\u2019s why. Celaena Sardothien is an assassin trained by the King of the Assassins. Caught (after potentially being betrayed\u2014you can read all about it in The Assassin's Blade , which I HIGHLY recommend), she is sentenced to hard labor in a salt mine until she dies for an indefinite period of time. After a year, she is offered a way out--all she has to do is defeat twenty-three other candidates in a competition to be the King\u2019s Champion. That\u2019s all. Just beat a multitude of bigger, stronger men after spending a year as a slave in a work camp. No big. But it is no big for Celaena b/c Celaena is just that good. SIDE RANT: I\u2019ve read a lot of reviews for this book, and the most common complaint is that Celaena is too girly to be a believable assassin. I say N-O-N-S-E-N-S-E. No one bats an eye when Gin Blanco ( Elemental Assassin by Jennifer Estep) starts baking. What\u2019s the huge difference between a love of cooking and a love of pretty things? I\u2019m not seeing it. In fact, a love of clothes and a preoccupation with appearance is more consistent with being an assassin, in my opinion. A love of cooking seems like more of an individual quirk whereas a desire to look pretty is characteristic of the narcissistic personality type that would be required to kill indiscriminately (unless, of course, it\u2019s a child or a Terrasen) <------Celaena\u2019s hard limits. Whatever. I like Celaena. She\u2019s alternatingly badass and hysterically funny. I don\u2019t know which version I prefer\u2014the one that takes on her chauvinistic opponent in a sword duel without bothering to unsheathe her sword, or the one that shrieks at billiard balls for refusing to go where she wants them to go. But Celaena isn\u2019t the only thing Throne of Glass has going for it, not by a long shot. Both of the potential love interests are seriously swoonworthy, and the big bad(s)\u2014sometimes it/they seem to operate in a committee-like fashion\u2014are a well-crafted target for your contempt. There are exotic foreign princesses and magically summoned monsters, and there are just enough hints-of-things-to-come to keep your nails chewed to nubs while you wait for your next fix, I mean the next book. If you\u2019re a lover-of-Fantasy, Throne of Glass should definitely be at the top of your to-read list. The only problem is that right now it\u2019s a six book series, so we won\u2019t know how it ends until 2017. Here\u2019s to delayed gratification. *wink* My other reviews for this series: The Assassin's Blade: The Throne of Glass Novellas Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass #2) Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3) Queen of Shadows (Throne of Glass #4) Untitled (Throne of Glass, #5) ...more Throne of Glass came to me highly recommended by someone who thinks Twilight is among the best books of all time, so I was instantly wary, but I promised to keep an open mind since, well, high fantasy and a kick ass assassin, what could go wrong?

Well, a lot, apparently. I\u2019m not saying this book is by any means on Twilight \u2019s level of awfulness, but it is one of the shallowest, least impressive fantasies I\u2019ve ever read. I've never read the original, but I think I have a good idea where Sarah J. Maas went wrong writing her final version. She started out with her badass chick assassin, Celaena Sardothien, figured she needed a love triangle to keep the romance interesting, then settled on a plot, and finally filled in the setting. Unfortunately, setting really should've come first. In every other fantasy I've read, there's always some interesting hook that almost immediately tells me why the author created that particular fantasy world for his or her characters. For me, it's probably even more crucial than the characters themselves. And for the first half of this book, Erilea is just generic - tyrant of fancifully named country tries to conquer other fancifully named countries. Nothing about the world building tells me why I should care about what's going on. I'll admit a little before the halfway mark, Maas introduces the concept of Wyrdmarks, sort of like ancient runes, and adds in a little ancient history of Erilea with Elena, the first queen of Adarlan, but while these developments did add a little flavor to bland Erilea, I'm still no closer to understanding, why Celaena? Why Erilea? Celaena herself may be the best thing about this book, but that's not saying much. She's not entirely one dimensional, she's got the survived a death camp but was tough enough to leave with her humanity intact thing going for her, but I found her difficult to like at first. She talks big, whether it's how she can disarm so and so in three moves or kill so and so in five seconds, but never backs up those words with actions until way too late in the book - by then every other sentence being about how awesome she is was seriously grating on my nerves. Even then, I still can't believe how someone who complains about how uncomfortable corsets are and likes to sleep in can be Adarlan\u2019s Assassin. Isn't the kingdom's best assassin supposed to be tough and more than willing to bear nuisances as trivial as a tight corset? And when there are scenes like the one where she's surprised in bed by a bag of candy, she doesn't know who it's from and promptly eats half the bag even though there's a killer loose in the castle ... ummm, am I the only one who sees so many things wrong with that? How did she not wake up when the bag was delivered, especially when she's rigged the doors to squeak? Why didn't she suspect poison? Is she even a competent assassin? But I definitely reserve the brunt of my criticism for Chaol and Dorian. First of all, in most books there's a plot and a romance on top of that, in Throne of Glass two thirds of the time it feels like romance first and plot second. I mean, the Captain of the Guard and the Prince, they don't do anything, they're just there to be love interests. It's frustrating to read scene after scene of batting eyelashes and inane banter, expect these characters to do something relevant to the plot, and they just stand around flirting with Celaena. Even minor characters Nox and Pelor ended up doing more, having a bigger impact on the plot, than those two, and Nox and Pelor are definitely in far fewer scenes. Look, I have nothing against love interests, but these guys are just pointless love interests. And the flirting, I am not exaggerating when I say setting up the love triangle takes up two thirds of the book. Actually, Throne of Glass 's first half is entirely dull and forgettable, the real story doesn't even begin until over two hundred pages in. Even then, the way everything comes together, it's entirely predictable. Maas drops way too many too obvious hints about the champion deaths, the strange Wyrdmarks, the villain behind the whole thing, I was three steps ahead of Celaena the whole time. And yet, somehow she still doesn't explain the point of the entire plot. Instead, it's one of those, yeah, congratulations you get a bit of somewhat intense action and some closure with the defeat of a minor villain while I tease the real plot but will be secretive and cryptic about it so you better read the sequel. I don't get it. How can a book that had four prequels to set up the story still be nothing but setup? Maybe the whole thing will make sense in the sequel, but that's no excuse for the lack of substance in this book. ...more I'm afraid this just wasn't for me .

But let's start at the beginning. Celaena Sardothien has spent years in the death camps of Endovier, where she will ultimately spend the rest of her life. Until, that is, crown prince Dorian appoints her to enter in a competition for the title of King's Champion, who will be tasked to do the King's secret bidding. But when one by one, the competitors turn up dead, Celaena knows that something evil lurks the castle. Instead of the action-packed novel I was lead to believe I'd be reading, all I got were ... balls and dances, and then some fight scenes are thrown in there just to make sure we don't forget that this is supposed to be a story of an assassin. No, Sarah J Maas , I hope you don't forget what we came here for. When I say that Throne of Glass lowers the standards of Fantasy , I mean that it doesn't seem to know much about its own setting. Royal Households everywhere, at every turn of the century, have a set of rules dictating things such as etiquette; what is proper and what is im proper. And these rules don't exist for the sake of it - there are reasons behind etiquette: to prevent affronting your peers, for instance. To prevent harmful court gossip. To prevent a crown prince from running around and fathering a thousand bastards before he is even dubbed King, creating more than enough future claimants to the throne. I assume the same applies in Throne of Glass ; for instance there are etiquettes mentioned that deem a prince dancing with only one partner something considerably rude. So it threw me way out of time and place when I found out that Chaol, Captain of the Guards, would enter Celaena's chambers at any time of day he wishes - even when she's still dressed in her scanty nightgown. Even the Prince does this; visiting her whensoever he pleases. You may call me a prude, you may call me many anti-feminist names, but this is not acceptable. Not because I give two cents on what the court would say about Celaena; not that I give two cents whether or not the prince was copulating with her; but because this is simply not done . Especially not without repercussion, if even in the form of social stigma. Celaena had a maid waiting on her - but it seems that all she was good for was putting her clothes on. It was Chaol who barged in her room, underdressed as she was, just to wake her up. He is a Captain of the Guards . This should not even be his task! These small, ridiculous ignorance of Royal Household etiquette and division of labour made it seem as if the whole thing was poorly researched. You may argue that this was not feudal England; that this world was built entirely of Maas ' imagination, but things such as logic should still apply. And when has it ever been logical for a Captain of Guards to be responsible for waking up guests? When has it ever been acceptable for a Prince to come and go, without repercussion, into a common girl's chambers? But that is exactly the problem with Throne of Glass . The entire premise wasn't logical. By this I am of course talking about the King's competition. \"(...) He's hosting a competition. He invited twenty-three members of his council to each sponsor a would-be Champion to train in the glass castle and ultimately compete in a duel.\" ... and this Champion of his is tasked ... To work for the King of Adarlan as his loyal servant. She raised her chin. To kill for him (...) But where is the logic fail? you ask me. Allow me to reiterate. He wants a loyal subject to kill for him, without question, with the utmost secrecy. Yet he chooses this loyal subject through a competition . Not only that, he makes his councilmen choose the competitors for him. I may not be a direct member of a royal family myself, but I know there are things such as court intrigue and hidden agendas and hell, there are hundreds upon thousands of discrete allegiances and plots being made left, right and centre. Do you really want your future, \"loyal\" Champion to be handpicked out of a number of criminals and entrusted to your councilmen ? The whole competition thing wasn't at all very thought through. In the end, it felt as if it was just there to get the story going, to get Celaena into the castle. The competition itself was a let down; meaning instead of some fight-to-the-death (or similar) trope, we get ... a race. An archery competition. Wall-climbing. And a lot of others that happened off screen. Amidst all these competitions and training programs, the plot scattered into flirting banter, gatecrashing parties, and some girl-on-girl hating; as if the author wasn't quite sure whether she wanted her novel to be the story of a ruthless assassin, or the romances of a ruthless assassin princess-wannabe . And now I get to that point -- Celaena, the princess-wannabe. Allow me to present a number of quotes I've highlighted: She loved clothes--loved the feeling of silk, of velvet, of satin, of suede and chiffon--and was fascinated by the grace of seams, the intricate perfection of an embossed surface. And when she won this ridiculous competition, when she was free ... she could buy all the clothes she wanted. * Everything was wet and half-frozen, and while she could bear sodden hair, she couldn't withstand the agony of wet shoes. * There were more Champions seated at the tables--even the pimply-faced Pelor sat near Chaol! A half-rate boy assassin! She bared her teeth. How dare she be denied an invitation to the feast? You read all that and tell me, do you imagine these thoughts coming from a renown, world-class assassin ? An assasin complaining about her wet shoes? About not being invited to a banquet ? No. Two things strike me here: First, she had just spent years at a death camp , but her behaviour upon leaving it did not portray any humility or gratefulness of being far away from all those whippings and forced labour. You'd think she'd just be glad to be away from the mines and pickaxe to be complaining about wet shoes SMH. Second; this sounds more like something a ditzy princess-wannabe would say . Oh, after I win this competition, I'm gonna buy myself some clothes . For someone who has spent years suffering, who spent her childhood being trained as a ruthless killer, she comes across sounding so privileged . Now, I'm not an assassin. I've never been trained as one, but for years I did go through a whole series of martial arts before finding one that suited my small stature. And of all martial arts -- from karate to jiu-jitsu to wushu to the one I finally settled with -- there was one thing we were taught was the foundation of any great martial artist. Discipline . And I'm sorry, Celaena. But you don't have it . This is her reaction to failing at a game of pool : A shriek of rage ripped from her throat, and Celaena ran over to the pocket. She first screamed at the ball, then took the cue in her hands and bit down upon the shaft, still screaming through her clamped teeth. Finally the assassin stopped and slapped the three ball into the pocket. This is her discipline at training: \"It's cold,\" she moaned, holding her knees to her body. She didn't care that she had only a few months to beat the other Champions--she needed sleep.\" I'm afraid it doesn't work that way; you don't get to tell me that this girl is an accomplished, feared assassin at the age of.... sixteen?.... but her entire mentality, her entire personality does not ring true of an assassin . Do you think the realm's greatest killer would be afraid of walking in a glass house? \"Only an idiot would walk in a house made of glass.\" (...) The thought of standing on floors of glass made her queasy. ....afraid of heights ? She had a terrible headache around her left temple. Everything was sickly and frail. They were so high up, so dangerously high ... Do you think they moan and whinge and complain at the drop of a hat? Once they'd finished their run, they trained in a private room far from her competitor's eyes. Until, that is, she collapsed to the ground and cried that she was about to die of hunger and fatigue. * Celaena frowned at herself as she hurried after the captain into the foyer. \"I look ridiculous! These pants are absurd, and this shirt is awful.\" For heaven's sake, you're an assassin, not a supermodel. No. Discipline doesn't just mean getting up every morning and training every day. It also means a discipline of the mind . It means self-restraint. It means keeping your head low. What kind of assassin wants to be the centre of attention?? To have her skills known?? If you want glory, then you're in the wrong career path. Be a damned knight. But Celaena is vain and self-absorbed . She wants to be in the spotlight . \"I hate all these guards and nonsense; I hate you telling me to hold back when Brullo sings Cain's praises and I'm just there, boring and unnoticed in the middle.\" * \"Do you know how insulting it is to pretend to be some nobody thief from a small city in Fenharrow?\" Not only that, but she's also very contradictory and hypocritical: What was a \"Champion\" but a dressed-up name for murderer? Could she actually stomach working for him? And I suppose \"assassin\" is just a synonym for mercy-killer? But enough of her faults. Let's take a look at her more positive attributes. She's beautiful. In fact so beautiful that she drains the blood out of people who sees her: Celaena smiled smugly to herself as she nodded to a passing noble-man, who raised his eyebrows at the sight of her. He was immensely pale, she noticed as he opened his mouth to say something, but Celaena continued down the hall. In fact so beautiful that other ladies envy her and she has to shove that in their faces (view spoiler) [because you can't have a YA novel without other girls being envious of our heroine! (hide spoiler) ] : She smiled at the young chevaliers as they passed--and smirked at the court women who eyed her pink-and-white gown. She couldn't blame them; the dress was spectacular. And she was spectacular in it. Even Redd, one of the handsomer guards posted outside her rooms, had said so. Also shallow, as it seems, because if Redd hadn't been handsome, his opinion wouldn't have mattered, right? Still not convinced that she's shallow? Why did Chaol never joke with her as Dorian did? Perhaps he truly didn't find her attractive. The possibility of it stung more than she would have liked. You see, because people can only like you if you're attractive . Oh, sorry, I got sidetracked. We were talking over her positive attributes. Well, she's a great dancer: She didn't falter a single step, nor did she seem to care about the many angry female faces that watched as dance after dance passed and they didn't switch partners. She also plays a mean piano (view spoiler) [because music is like, the way we show just how deep and artistic our heroine is (hide spoiler) ] : Celaena eyed the pianoforte. She used to play--oh, she'd loved to play, loved music(...) She loves dogs (view spoiler) [because that's how we know she's a kind-hearted person. No evil person is an animal lover! (hide spoiler) ] : \"Of course I want her,\" Celaena said, then realized what the implications would be. \"But I want her trained. I don't want her urinating on everything and chewing on furniture and shows and books. And I want her to sit when I tell her to and lay down and roll over (...) Oh, but she doesn't want to be inconvenienced so she doesn't want to train it herself of course! She speaks foreign languages, and! just so we can all relate to her -- she also loves books! I could go on and point out her inconsistencies , but this is getting much too long for my liking. In short, Celaena Sardothien is a Mary Sue . But even worse -- she is an unlikeable , vain, shallow, self-centred Mary Sue . And if you expect me to believe she's a deadly killer, then you better think again. But that is the final problem I had with this book -- the narrator constantly tells us what to believe. There was something great and deadly concealed within her, and he didn't like it. while moments later, she's rolling on the ground, crying and whinging that she's gonna die of starvation. Yeah, no. Also, \"Because it looks like he's in love with her,\" he said, and walked away. (...) His shoulders were straight, his back erect. He looked like a man. Like a king. Yeah, if you say so. But, Amanda, you say to me, there must be something you liked? Well, I did like Celaena's relationship with the err, Indian princess. I forgot her name. Because I didn't like the actual princess herself -- she doesn't know tact. She doesn't know diplomacy. She comes to a foreign realm and all she does is whinge and insult their language and clothes and court. So, no. I didn't like the plot, I didn't like the characters. The only stars go to Chaol for being a beacon of sanity amidst all the awfulness. It's a pity he, too, fell for our Mary Sue.

But I cannot deny that this first book is pretty shaky. If you're just starting this series, hang in there: it gets better . The sheer scope of the worldbuilding in this series is phenomenal, so check it out if you like fantasy. I really can\u2019t think of many other worlds I love this much\u2026 I mean, there are demon kings, Fae, witches & wyverns, pirate lords, princes, kingdoms & castles, magic, spirits with cryptic advice, swords & battles, ancient prophecies, politics, well-developed history & religion, multiple complex villains, and it spans multiple continents and cultures. This book starts with Celaena being a prisoner in the death camp/salt mine of Endovier. The Crown Prince Dorian, Chaol (the Captain of the Guard), and a couple other characters who will matter later all arrive at Endovier to retrieve Celaena for a competition to be the King's Champion. It has a Hunger Games feel to it as all of the assassins train with various weapons and slowly get eliminated. But then tons of awesome stuff with Wyrdmarks and portals and Fae history gets woven in and the competition becomes even more threatening... but this stuff is explained way better in the sequels. Like the whole \"evil\" plot in this book is just a shadow of the amazing tangled mess it turns into eventually. The rougher writing style in this book was a bit hard for me to get through ( all of the exclamations! ) and the plot is more simplistic. But I still like this story because it sets up the wonderful world & characters I grew to love! So when I first read Throne of Glass a few years ago I gave it 2 stars because I was expecting some badass assassin but then thought I got a snarky immature mean girl who's obsessed with dresses and boys. I absolutely could not stand her . (But, that also kind of shows how amazing these books become if I could eventually come to connect so much with the same character)! The reader is mostly told over and over that Celaena is this amazing assassin who could skin someone without a blade. But all I really saw was some arrogant girl whose main focus was how much she wanted to kiss the prince. And if she's the \"world's greatest assassin,\" would she seriously eat several pounds of candy someone just left anonymously in her room?! I was so annoyed with her that I initially ended up skimming most of the first book. I threw it aside and didn't pick up the sequel for another few years (worst choice ever). BUT I saw everything in this book waaaay differently after I read The Assassin's Blade and the rest of the series and saw everything Celaena went through before she went to Endovier. Now when I read this book I mostly want to hug instead of punch her now that I understand her better. Things I liked both times I read this book: - Celaena has the confidence to know she's attractive and own it -- you don't see a lot of cocky, secure female MCs. - CHAOL. Chaol is totally the best part of this book. - The story actually addresses the fact that Celaena WILL get her period while going about her badass assassin life and that will complicate things. Thank you. - The love triangle in this book is kind of whatever... but I will go down defending what happened between the second and third books. I know some people recommend reading the The Assassin's Blade first... I think I wouldn't have cared as much about the characters in those novellas if I hadn't read the main books first, but I also think the novellas might help with enduring Celaena in this book. So either way works. Oh, and I totally love the parallels between all of SJM's characters and worlds. (Like Celaena in Heir of Fire and Feyre in ACOMAF are so wonderfully similar). Quotes like \"Lady Lillian belongs to herself and no one else,\" \"the stars who gazed back,\" and \"if they tried to take her from him, he'd rip the world apart with his bare hands\" made me smile. Basically this first book is a fun story, but it could be better executed and absolutely pales in comparison with the sequels! This is a series people either love or hate... I really haven't seen any neutral opinions. Everyone seems to make up their mind at the end of the second book, so maybe give that a chance! ...more LOVED THIS BOOK: Here's my full review complete with discussion and theories http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xlmj_t...

So let me break down what I liked and what I didn\u2019t like so that you can decide whether you want to read it for yourself. I liked\u2026 Celeana. This is not a common thing, apparently. Isn't Celaena the ditziest, most incompetent assassin ever? :D She's all \"ohhh, can It\u2019s always intimidating to review a book so loaded by high fan expectations and low critic opinions.

Isn't Celaena the ditziest, most incompetent assassin ever? :D She's all \"ohhh, candy! ohh, Dorian's smile. ohhh, ball gowns\" She was arrogant, vain, narcissistic, flawed and I loved every bit of it. I loved her love of pretty dresses and candy. The girl was in a death camp ffs! She can enjoy anything she wants. I love her love of food I loved watching her make friends, I loved her blood thirsty, ragey nature that was sometimes comical. But it\u2019s okay not to like those things. It\u2019s easy to remember she\u2019s an 18 year old girl and easy to forget she\u2019s an assassin in this book. Because she doesn\u2019t do a whole lot of any kind of murdering. I really just needed her to kill someone\u2026Just one person! The plot made it hard to show off any of the best ideas about this book because it mostly revolved around the romance between Celeana, Dorian and Chaol. Something of which I had absolutely no investment at all. In fact, the narrative would SKIP over the tests and the gory deaths of people just so that we could see more of these two dudes skipping around mooning of Celeana who is, sorry, about a million times more interesting than either of them. *Cue angry fan reactions* The plot didn\u2019t do Celeana justice because she was always like: And I SO wanted to believe it, but why should the reader believe these claims of how badass she is, when you can\u2019t see her doing any badass stuff. Just a lot of prancing around and promises to kill people. Promises, may I add, that don\u2019t get fulfilled! Can you tell I\u2019m a bloodthirsty wench since I wanted a little stabby stabby so bad? The writing was perfectly serviceable and most parts, I don\u2019t have many complaints about that. I just wanted to not be bored. I wanted it so bad. But I was. Hopefully, the second book will make me fall in love. I received this book for free from Book Expo America in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.

The author keeps harping on the idea that Celaena Sardothien is a top notch, tough as nails killer with little fear or inhibition, but hardly anything Celaena does actually reflects that. She seems downright lighthearted to me. That's not to say an assassin can't be lighthearted to some degree, but I don't imagine a person who just spent a year in a slave camp where the typical survival rate is 2-3 months would possess this type of flippant, joking attitude. I honestly did not care about any of the characters while I read this. I did not care who won the competition, and I did not care who won Celaena's heart. The author told me exactly how I should feel at every turn, but did little to SHOW me why I should feel that way.
