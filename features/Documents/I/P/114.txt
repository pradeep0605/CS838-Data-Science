AN OLDER TEENAGE GIRL WHO IS REPRESSED IN SOME WAY -- family secrets, personal secrets, others' expectations, her own cynicism or need for control 3. MEETS A WACKY GROUP OF PEOPLE -- long-distant family, a rock band, coworkers, a new group of friends 4. INCLUDING ONE UNUSUAL BOY -- usually artistic in some way 5. SHE DOES SOMETHING UNCHARACTERISTIC OF HER THAT STARTS OR DEEPENS HER RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM -- like confess a secret, or kiss the boy, or take on a job -- something that exposes her for a moment 6. AND THINGS GO ALONG SWIMMINGLY FOR A WHILE as she gets to know the boy and has her original assumptions about the people challenged and develops new skills through her association with them 7. But then, about 1/3 to 1/4 of the way from the end, SOMETHING HAPPENS TO SCREW THINGS UP, usually causing the girl's retreating for some reason into her original repressions/assumptions 8. A CONFRONTATION INVOLVING/REGARDING THE CAUSE OF THE GIRL'S REPRESSION OCCURS. 9. GIRL REUNITES WITH BOY; HAPPINESS INTO FORESEEABLE FUTURE. There is no doubt Ms. Dessen works and reworks this material very, very well -- she has wonderful, fully developed image systems (in this one, the idea of what being a girl means, and riding a bike); the prose flows gorgeously; her supporting characters are consistently marvelous; the dialogue is terrific and realistic, particularly when it's teenagers sitting around b.s.'ing; every i is dotted and t crossed writingwise. I love the way she weaves all her characters into one large world. And I adored this plot the first time I read it, in THIS LULLABY, and also greatly enjoyed THE TRUTH ABOUT FOREVER and JUST LISTEN. (Also, she creates great store names -- someone should hire her as a brander.) But by this one, I was feeling a bit of diminishing returns in the familiarity of everything, chiefly in the fact that all her narrators sound the same, the same hiddenness, the same neatness. I'd love to see her do a book from the point of view of one of the supporting characters, or the boy . . . someone a little more scattered, more unpredictable and passionate, where the voice and the story wouldn't tie up in a neat bow. I do not know that this wish is fair to Ms. Dessen; when you know your material, you should own it and work it, and she's doing that, and I'm delighted that it's paying off for her. (Such a pleasure to see a GOOD writer of teenage romances on the Times bestseller list!) But all the supporting characters here felt more interesting than Auden to me, and the few changes she rung here just too familiar; and I'd love for Ms. Dessen to break some new ground in both structure and protagonist. ...more Reading Sarah Dessen is like walking into an air-conditioned store after a hot, humid day in the sun.

Reading Sarah Dessen is also like drinking an ice-cold smoothie after a long, harsh marathon. And finally, reading Sarah Dessen is like eating comfort food: you always know what you're going to get, a tasty, satisfying treat. Auden has just finished her senior year and looks forward to spending the summer like she usually does: staying home and studying, while occasionally attending the parties hosted by her mom for her grad students. However, instead of following routine like she usually does, Auden decides to spend the summer at the attractive beach town where her dad and his new family reside. There, she meets her half-sister, Thisbe, as well as her first group of real friends. But the most alluring thing about the town is Eli: an ambiguous, secretive young man who is an insomniac, just like Auden. Late at night, they explore the childhood Auden never had - they get to know each other, and open up from what has restricted them in the past. 4.5 stars. I really love Sarah Dessen's writing. Previously stated by my plethora of similes in the first paragraph, it's just a comfort to be able to read her work. The strongest aspect of Dessen's novels are her characters. They are perfectly written - nuanced, flawed, yet so extremely likable and fleshed out. There's something that readers can relate to in every character: whether it be the driven determination of Auden's mom, or the insecurity Auden has with failing, etc. The only reason <+++>Along for the Ride</+++> didn't receive the full five stars is because I felt there was something missing: there wasn't the extra punch Dessen usually delivers in her books. I just wanted to make it clear that it's not because of how formulaic some find her books to be. I simply space out the time between her novels, so I don't feel like I'm reading the same story over and over. Overall, very good. I'm already looking forward to reading another book by Sarah Dessen.

(Of course, this analogy is entirely redundant if vanilla happens to be your favourite flavour and you hate chocolate.) (In which case, WHAT ARE YOU?) In fact, let me add to that comparison: with Along For The Ride , I thought I ordered a nice, rich scoop of caramel, drizzled with hot fudge and whipped cream abound, but what I got instead was a $1 cone from McDonalds. I feel like this story held so much potential. Auden's personal problems dealing with family issues, social situations, insomnia, even as far as cycling (yes, I am 18 and only just learned how *insert gasp*)\u2014 they were all things I could directly relate to within some depth. And so I went into this hoping I could take away something profound, and if not, then learning things from a different perspective at the very least. No good book is a \"good book\" unless it leaves an impact on its readers some way or the other. But this? It did nothing for me. Absolutely nada, zero, zilch. Unless you count feelings of frustration over a wasted 6 hours and lost sleep as anything. The entire storyline boils down to having no important point to it at all and if it's meant to be a semi-inspiring \"coming of age\" novel, then it's done a gosh damn shoddy job of it. The one tiny aspect that I did appreciate was the concept of how teenagers should be given the freedom to find their own niche, figure their own life out without the pressure from parents \u2013or anyone else at all\u2013 to follow a certain path. Also, how appearances and gender stereotypes are a complete and total sham. Buuuut. While well-written, that message was lost amidst poor execution with a yawn-worthy plot and a ridiculously detached romance (seriously, I have more chemistry with the subject chemistry than these two do with each other and that's saying something). You're better off going to Ikea and shopping for furniture (something I missed in favour of reading this) than hopping along for this ride; that'd be more adventurous than Eli and Auden's late night adventures ever will be.

Which I wouldn't mind too much if the characters didn't seem so similar. They all are so reserved and issue driven. One of the reasons I think that it didn't work so magically in this one was because Eli (the love interest)doesn't get explored enough. He's dealing with some truly heavy stuff and we do see glimpses of vulnerability but it's not enough. Does that make sense? But please don't mistake my irks with it as a bad review for the book. I love Sarah Dessen's writing. Even though she tends to use the same storyline it works because she knows how to work it. One of the things I was thrilled to see was the subplot story of Auden's baby sister and her new stepmother Heidi. We don't see this relationship much in young adult books and it made me smile to see Dessen use her own life experiences and insert them in her writing. You know what they say, write what you know. As always the minor characters are pitch perfect. My favorites in this one were <---C>Maggie</---C> and Adam. Everything is always done so well: character development, dialogue, growth it's no wonder people love Dessen's work. All the symbols like the bike, quest, beach, are done in a way to make you get attached it to it so much, and think \" yeah I TOTALLY get that! \" By the way I thought the idea of going on a quest sounded awesome and was a real unique way of getting Auden and Eli to really connect. It was funny to see all the cameo appearances from people in previous books. The funniest being Jason (Macy's old boyfriend in the The Truth About Forever ). Dessen should totally write a book about him. I appreciated the way Auden and Eli meet. Most of the time they seem to click easily, but it was a bit harder for them so that was a welcome change. I hated Auden's dad. What a selfish guy, but one of the main lessons of this book is that people can change. I want to mention all the minor characters (like always there is a lot going on) but I simply can't. You'll just have to delve into the pages yourself. Brilliant idea of setting a lot of the book at night. It gives the book and the conversations that extra special touch. Even though it was not one of my favorites do read it. It will make you look at growing up differently. ...more Cross-posted from my blog review . Auden is your classic overachiever: she\u2019s studious and entirely too serious.

Auden is your classic overachiever: she\u2019s studious and entirely too serious. What\u2019s more, she deprived herself of a normal high school experience\u2014one with friends and fun\u2014opting instead for the academic route. Which did indeed work, because she got into a great university, the one she\u2019d be attending come August. In the meantime, there is the whole summer stretching before her, and suddenly, spending it at home with her holier-than-thou, my-feminism-is-better-than-yours, literary professor of a mother and her revolving door of grad student flirts, dinner parties and drinking isn\u2019t cutting it. So, Auden decides to spend summer in Colby (this isn\u2019t set in Lakeview!) with her father, her stepmother Heidi (whom her mother deems a waste of space because of her girly tendencies), and their newborn Thisbe (her father is also a literary snob). She isn\u2019t sure exactly what to expect in Colby, but it\u2019s definitely not what she finds: a hookup she stupidly stumbled upon, her father immersed in his novel and not paying any heed to Heidi and the ever-crying Thisbe, Heidi\u2019s imminent breakdown, or the job she inadvertently falls into, keeping the books for Heidi\u2019s shop, Clementine\u2019s. With the job come three girls\u2014the other employees\u2014who\u2019re everything her mother stands against: girly and frivolous. Set in her snobby (and shy) ways, Auden secludes herself from the group and works diligently in the back room. However, she can\u2019t keep hiding away forever. She doesn\u2019t sleep at night, and neither does this strange guy Eli she keeps seeing around. One thing\u2014Eli\u2019s help in placating Thisbe in the middle of the night while Heidi catches up on some sleep\u2014leads to another\u2014seeing Eli at a party\u2014and they become night buddies, embarked in a quest to give Auden a second chance at the childhood she never had, one food fight at a time. As the summer progresses, Auden aggregates herself to the trio from Clementine\u2019s, faces the errors of her prejudice toward people influenced by her mother, and basically examines her entire life up to that point. The summer is, quite simply, a Renaissance. Auden\u2019s character resonated with me. Like her, I\u2019ve changed school multiple times (seven, if memory serves) and that\u2019s made me feel like I\u2019ve missed some crucial school experiences and rendered me socially retarded. Granted, I hide it a lot better than she does (seriously), but the underlying insecurity is much the same. Also, her prejudice toward \u201cfluffy\u201d girls is something I\u2019ve faced as well, as was her discovery of substance beyond the pink exterior. This is terribly realistic stuff for us self-absorbed teens who figure we know everything and are always the smartest in the room. Which brings me to the characterization: Sarah Dessen is quite accomplished at possibly every facet of writing and storytelling, but I believe her true forte is her characters. Even Thisbe, Auden\u2019s newborn half-sister, had personality. I loved how all important characters had layers upon layers that continuously surprised me, the reader. Reading this book was a peeling-the-onion experience, to be sure. Another thing I love in Sarah is that she doesn\u2019t write about foreign\u2014futuristic or fantastical\u2014worlds but rather about the one in which I reside, and yet her world building is so adept, rich, filled with detail, that I can\u2019t help but lose myself in it. In the hands of another writer, her books would probably be half their size and probably still be good (I love her familiar-yet-foreign approach to plotting universal situations in an unique way), but wouldn\u2019t come alive as they do with her mastery of setting me in the mood and atmosphere. And finally, I love that this is a smart read. Aside from having smart-sounding content (Auden is, after all, an ambulant brain), the book itself is smart in that it\u2019ll probably identify with each person in a different way. I identified with Auden\u2019s alienation and her awakening to the people around her, but with the number of other things going on, I\u2019m sure other parts will speak louder to other people. Her dysfunctional family situation, the unresolved divorces, the overall complicated nature of each troubling aspect of the book\u2026 Quite frankly, like with Laurie Halse Anderson, I wonder where Sarah Dessen gets so much experience with such an array of different topics to write about them with such bang. It\u2019s downright formidable, the skill these two possess. Now, ironically, given the book\u2019s subject matter, I read this one during one of my insomnia episodes. In fact, it\u2019s 7:52 a.m. as of writing this sentence, and I just had breakfast and sat down to write this review. I\u2019ll be going to sleep soon as I finish it, quite satisfied at that, because this book turned an otherwise destined to be useless night, exciting, interesting, and memorable. (Which is more than I can say about all the others, considering I can\u2019t even distinguish one from another\u2026) I have to say, though\u2014and this is one of my only (minor) objections to something in this book\u2014I\u2019m not sure if insomnia is exactly what Auden has. She has a general discomfort with sleeping at night (explained in the book), but insomnia is the inability to sleep, even if given the opportunity. She just drinks loads of coffee to snap out of it. There\u2019s a difference, and believe me, as an insomniac, I envy the people with the choice. Anyway. Sarah Dessen is definitely on an uphill climb of quality. She is one of those authors I am damn near worshiping and would die if I had the opportunity to interview or something. Counting this one, I\u2019ve loved her last three books, each successively more than the other. I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be able to top Lock and Key\u2014which is second only to This Lullaby, as far as I\u2019m concerned\u2014anytime soon, but she did with this one. Her work\u2014particularly at its best\u2014is the kind that inspires me, moves me, even in the bleakest (or most boring, as was the case) of scenarios. Definitely required reading. ...more I\u2019m just going to start this out saying that I love Sarah Dessen. <+++>Along for the Ride</+++> is definitely on my Dessen all time favorite list.

Just because you're girly and like the color pink, doesn't mean you're dumb. I feel like that's a stereotype many people have about girls. \"Who says you have to be either smart or pretty, or into girly stuff or sports? Life shouldn't be about the either/or.

Her dad and mom are divorced and her dad moved on with another women named Heidi. After getting an email from Heidi, about her having a baby, Auden decides to do something she has never done before. She went to visit and stay with her father's family for the summer. She met her sister, Thisbe and was doing so many things that she never expected to do. Later on, she gets a job at Clementines, a clothes store and she meets so many people. Eli is a guy who is quiet and lonely, but he had a past that follows him everywhere.

In some ways, me and Auden have so many things in common. I don't really have a social life, but I am lucky to have a really close friend. Even if others think I have a social life, it's a really small one. Goodreads is one of the things that has helped me out and made me come out of my shell. Me and my friend had a conversation once and it had us thinking about where we belong. We feel like we don't belong anywhere, but although this is supposed to be sad, we find it to be hilarious. Every day, we ask each other the same question, \"Where do we belong?\" But in the end, we start laughing, while people on the streets give us dirty looks. \u201cIt's still a memory worth having, even if it's not exactly what you imagined.\u201d ,/b> In some ways, Auden felt the same way, and that is one of the things I liked about this book. It was weird because ever since I started reading this book, I felt like I was lonely. It was like, I had a strong connection to this book and I am really glad that I do. Even Eli had the same impact on me, he was so easy to relate to in some ways. I really liked how Eli and Auden could connect in some ways and how both of their lives changed in the end. Even if they had their ups and downs, they were awesome friends and meant for each other. \u201cLife shouldn't be about the either/or. We're capable of more than that, you know?\u201d The side characters made the story more realistic and I loved most of them. I didn't like Jake at all though and I really wish that there was a part taken out of this book because I kept cringing when that incident came up. Leah, Maggie, Ester and Adam were amazing friends and I loved how welcoming they were. Maggie was one of my favorite characters, I am glad that she wasn't one of those drama queens. These characters knew how to make my day and make me feel better, if I am in a situation where I feel alone. They were all hilarious, and Eli and Auden had these moments where I would laugh my head off. Heidi was so stong and I loved Eli's mom. I didn't like Auden's father and wasn't a huge fan of her mother either. But Hollis was a nice older brother, although he was a player. They all had their flaws and that's what made the story so real and I loved that. \u201cJust because something\u2019s damaged doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be treated with respect\u201d Ever since I started to read books, I felt like I was never alone.

I know it's a bit dramatic, but this is how I feel. But if I don't have a book with me, I feel so empty and lost. It's like an addiction but a really good addiction and I know I will never stop reading.

However, I LOVE her books and now that I think about it yes she does write her books the same way, but I LIKE that way. Along for the Ride is my favourite book. Its one of those books you can just read into and enjoy parts that you liked even after you read it. The book is about a girl called Auden. Her parents are divorced and she lives with her mom. The divorce effected her very much and so she fell into studying,learning...She never did anything social or enjoyed her childhood and now to think of it she almost skipped it. But that years summer, she goes to her Dad who lives in Colby with a women who he has a child from. Auden meets this guy called Eli, she doesnt even really know him, but they spend a lot of their nights together as they both stay up late (Auden because before the divorce her parents were up fighting late at night) making up for the stuff that she never did in her childhood. But then her Dad and the women fight, her dad moves out for a \"break\". This brings up a lot of Audens past and she is going back into studying, learning...that she hasnt done, mostly blocking out Eli. But then she realizes how much he means to her, but can Eli forgive her? I would definitely advice you to read this book! I loved Eli`s character the \"we dont have to talk about it\" if anything embarrassing came up. I also think that a lot of people can relate to the story. I just loved it :) ...more Edit: \u0421\u043b\u0435\u0434 \u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430\u0445 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u0441\u043d\u043e\u0449\u0438 \u0434\u043e

I do not. I repeat. i do not want to know how a perfect pair of jeans will speak to you. Honestly. i am from singapore and the idea of summer is foreign here. We do get holidays here, but judging by the way the summer is described in Along for the Ride, you would think the characters in the book honestly have no purpose in life. they do the samething thing over and over EVERYDAY?? okay, i am getting too emotional. i should leave. but i can't. How many times does Auden and that Eli guy bring up the \"talking to a girl's ex-boyfriend in her own kitchen\" joke. how many times have i read the line \"i did not know how to reply to that\". Seriously, the whole purpose of this book is just lost on me. It is about second chances? hell yeah it is. of course it is about second chances if that word keeps popping up on every single page for the last part of the book!!!! for my own well being, i shall stop here. i apologise for the haywire review. And yes. UNFORTUNATELY .. i own a copy of this book. what a waste of space. ...more Edit: 4.5 stars after this reread. No idea why I rated it 3 stars back in 2012! One star because the prose is lovely. Another because, I mean, I finished it. Despite my issues with Sarah Dessen (and they are numerous), I really enjoyed Lock & Key so I hoped that meant she was moving away from the crap that annoys me so much about her writing. Alas, it is not to be. I liveblogged reading this for a friend, so instead of writing up AGAIN why this book made me so furious and frustrated, I'll just copy and paste for you: pg. 33, a dude is all OOH YOU'RE THE HOTTEST GIRL to Aud One star because the prose is lovely.

AGGHHHH. pg. 43, OMG, \"maybe my mom could play the aloof, selfish bitch\" - first of all WTF, secondly, ever think that your mom IS OK with just doing dudes and not getting attached? LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE. OMFG. This is a general complaint, but I think Sarah Dessen should have written the book about Heidi because that is clearly what she cares about more. Shocking she'd pen this one right after having her own baby, Y/N? I had this problem with the Megan McCafferty books as well, but I hate books where girly-girls are to be mocked and patronized and feminists are to be mocked and patronized, because it is such bullshit that there is a respectable space where women are allowed to exist, where the societal conventions aren't taken too far but where feminism is for lesbians and harpies. And I fucking hate it. I fucking hate it too because I think it's such a real thing, not just in literature, I see it all the time. Let's laugh at the Elle Woods of the world but let's laugh at self-identifying feminists too. Bull. Shit. I hate being expected to remember people from all other Sarah Dessen books. Here's news: I DO NOT. I feel like I'm reading fanfiction for a series I never watched. I hate this self-referential bullshit. God I'm saying bullshit a lot. I'm not sure why it's so awful Auden's mom came to town with the hot grad student. Or at all. Mothers are allowed to have sex lives. It's generally how they became mothers. pg. 158, that whole street smarts/book smarts dichotomy? Scientists have done studies. IT DOESN'T EXIST. IT IS A WAY FOR STUPID PEOPLE TO PRETEND THEY ARE NOT STUPID. IT IS A WAY FOR INTELLECTUALS TO BE RUDE. IT IS NOT OK GAHHHH. pg. 160 and leading up to it, I cannot believe the reason it was OK for Auden to be talking to Eli WASN'T because people aren't fucking possessions but because actually Eli and Belissa (UGH BELISSA ALSO OF COURSE SHE HAS BAD SKIN AND A POINTY NOSE) are actually broken up DUH! I'm sorry, but \"hot dog party\" sounds more like a \"sausage party\" to me. OK I finished it while out and away from my computer, but, anyway, other issues: I hate the implication that the only way to truly let people into your life and not be a lonely bitch is romantic attachment. I also hate the idea that you're either a girl who is partially girly and details her life's minutiae or you are a lonely bitch. I don't even get why the mom is so lonely. I don't know many women who don't have a group of friends, unless they are awful people. Even serious academics hang out with other serious academics or writers or researchers or whatever else. I think the either/or dichotomy is another huge falsehood. Also: hanging out with a bunch of grad students who think you're awesome and want to discuss literature with you? Sounds pretty good. Sounds like a social life to me. HATE that Heidi and the dad end up together after all. He is awful. He had so much more to learn and yet that is mainly glossed over. I mean, men fare so much better in the Dessenverse. Also confused about how Heidi understands Auden's mom because she was a lonely bitch once too. Uh, except she is 26. I don't think you really had time, Heidi. Dessen really seems confused about when life happens, or at least that's how I see it. Eli is fine and all but does he have much to him besides biking and helping Auden with HER quest? If this was backwards, I would call a book sexist for making a girl exist primarily to help a dude find out who HE is. I want more. It's not fair to Eli, also I can accept why she'd spend time with him but I never felt their relationship was actually justified to me. Also, back to the Dessen Has No Idea When You Are Supposed To \"Grow Up\", why is whatshisface that Auden slept with and Maggie used to date such a huge asshole? He's 18 and sleeps with girls who he thinks are hot. Ohhhkay? I thought that was... being 18. OH AND EDITED TO ADD THAT I FORGOT TO MENTION... that Auden's mom's boyfriend basically stalks her into submission. That's a GREAT lesson! ...more Along for the Ride, by Sarah Dessen, is a fun and enjoyable read. I have to admit, at first I could not stand the main character, Auden. She was self-centered, clueless about others feelings, snobbish and down-right annoying. I almost put the book down and called it a day because if I don\u2019t like the main character, chances are I\u2019m not going to enjoy the book.

However, all that altered by mid-book and the story took a sharp turn down Enjoyable Avenue. I feel Dessen\u2019s technique was deliberate, well timed and executed with precision. The story is about Auden who decides to spend the summer before her college freshman year in the beach town called Colby, where her father now lives with his new wife and newborn baby. Auden\u2019s parents had a rocky marriage and were divorced a few years prior, forcing her to take on an adult role and missing out on the luxuries and experiences of childhood and adolescence, which had a negative impact on her personality and approach with people. When Auden arrives in Colby, it is obvious she has no intention of bonding with anyone or making any friends during her stay. All that changes when she gets a job at a clothing boutique meets Maggie, Leah and Esther and a great guy named Eli that show her how much she\u2019s missed out on during her childhood. The summer she spends in Colby drastically changes her way of thinking and acting, and it is refreshing to see her transformation. I really enjoyed this book, but it took me a while to get there. So if you read it and find yourself annoyed with Auden, don\u2019t give up on her. Great book that I recommend as a light read. ...more This was my first Sarah Dessen book and it will not be my last.

I even dragged my feet through the last 50 pages just so I could stay in the pages with this world for a little while longer. The story focuses on Auden, who has always been serious, adult like, head in her books, never playful or silly her entire life. She has never stepped out of her safe, often isolated, world of academics until she decides to spend her summer before college with her Dad, new wife, and baby sister where she is definitely out of her comfort zone. There she meets a whole new cast of characters who teach her friendship, how to trust, have fun, and perhaps love. All the characters are likeable, developed, and layered with their own styles and back stories. I felt like the book took its time. Characters had the time to grow, learn, and change during the book. I really fell in love with all of them, but Eli stole my heart. Sarah Dessen might have written the perfect boy. When Rice Krispie treats came into the picture\u2014that boy had me hook line and sinker. Too, too cute! If only they made \u2018em like that in real life. :) Auden and Eli\u2019s all-night adventures were some of my favorite parts in the book. To bump right into the one person, who can help you open up, trust and love again or for the first time is very rare in this world. It was fun to ride along with them. It made me smile. I truly enjoyed the ride with Auden on her summer quest of second chances trying to learn how to be herself and enjoy the best of times. Warning though\u2014this book will suddenly make you want to start shopping at convenience stores! You will feel the pull of the neon signs urging you to pick up gum, tic-tacs, coffee, cupcakes, or slurpees and you know you can\u2019t leave with just one thing! :) Enjoy the ride! ...more Another FANTASTIC delivery from Sarah Dessen!

I won't deny that I would've done a few things differently than Auden but she's come so close to what I'm like--except I'm far from as academically driven as she was. But there are a lot of things that struck a chord. Another great novel by Sarah Dessen. I hope the mood strikes her again to write soon. 'Cause it's so hard to wait for one novel every two years. So hard. I stayed up much longer than my parents would ever condone. I felt like I connected with her better, since I read it in the middle of the night, with the house completely quiet, with this lovely tale spreading out in front of me. It was nearly impossible to put it down to go to bed before I collapsed. ...more Familiar and comforting. Although aspects of the book are predictable, it didn't make it less fun to read.

I would recommend this people so they can judge it themselves however, I didn't love it, but I also didn't hate it! ...more I expected a lot from this book but after reading some reviews I was getting worried. I was afraid that I would get bored in the middle of the book because everyone was saying it was the same as all her other books. It is very similar I\u2019ll agree to that, but there were differences. I\u2019ll also admit that after reading some other Sarah Dessen books I know that the ending turns out alright for the main girl but I personally like that.

One difference from this character is all about her studies and her parents are all intellectual. In the beginning I don\u2019t like her parents and as the story progresses I start hating them and near the end I don\u2019t like them but I don\u2019t hate them (like all Dessen\u2019s characters they weren't perfect). The mother is all stuck up and the father is selfish. Auden seems to catch on to that unconsciously but she soon realizes that she is too quick to judge people and learns to lend a hand every once in a while. The other characters were just what I\u2019d expected. I got annoyed at Maggie because she is perfect and nice. You get to wondering if this girl is for real, no one can be good at that many things. The love interest is different, he is more reserved and less corky than some of Dessen\u2019s other guys. It may sound bad but it made me think that he didn\u2019t have as much personality. I know that is not true, reserved people do have personality they just don\u2019t show it as much. At the end of the book I actually wanted to go ride a bike. I say that Sarah Dessen books are still worth reading. Maybe she should do a guy next to change things up. ...more I always finish books. Always. I HAVE to finish them. But with this, I mostly skimmed the last 50 pages because I was just that over it. In the end, it was just SO boring. Didn't much care for any of the characters (some were refreshing but most were cliches) and the romance was blah (the love interest also very blah).

Finished it in two days time, too - it would have taken me less time but I had to factor in pesky responsibilities like work. I love the way Dessen writes. Her characters are always real, and the storylines are believable - you can't ask for more than that! As with other Dessen books, there are multiple lessons learned in this book. The two that I felt that were most important (and I know it sounds clich\u00e9) is \"Live, Love, Laugh\" and \"Never judge a book by its cover.\" ALONG FOR THE RIDE is about a girl named Auden, fresh out of high school, ready to embark on the next leg of life but doesn't really know how to do it. The academic part she has down pat; the fun, let loose and be free part she has a lot of trouble with. Auden didn't have the typical childhood - she was more of an adult than a kid while she was growing up, entertaining herself through countless adult dinner parties revolving around academia. She missed out on so many rites of growing up - racing up and down her block on bicycles or skates, hanging out at the pool with friends, going on dates and even the prom. While it was great that she had such a drive to do well, her parents, now divorced, incredibly high expectations was also very damaging to her psyche. The cherry topping - Auden is an insomniac. Nothing, no matter what, changes or cures her insomnia. Of course, this can be a good thing, too, at least in her case. I can relate to the insomnia issue - it's just too bad that I haven't met the guy of my dreams during one of my episodes. I felt sorry for her many times throughout the book. So she escapes for the summer, leaving her overbearing mother behind, to live with her father, stepmother, and brand new sister. Is she trading one mess for another? It proves to be a summer of change and friendship and love. Auden definitely doesn't have an easy time of it - she has a lot to face, from how the turmoil of her parent's divorce has really affected her to actually having real friendships with girls and a guy who is genuinely interested in her. Thisbee shows Auden how to love unconditionally and the power of connecting. Eli shows her the magic of first love and where to get a great cup of coffee and a slice of pie in the middle of the night. Finally, Maggie, Leah, and Esther show how great friendships can be. Everyday brings something new and her summer in Colby teaches her to enjoy and appreciate the life she does have. A perfect summer read. ...more http://inbetweenwritingandreading.blo...

Yup, I hate the trailer :) Ok, so, for those of you who haven\u2019t seen the trailer it is here, though I\u2019ll still say the short version. Auden \u2013 main character of Along For The Ride \u2013 makes out with a guy on the beach and he has a girlfriend and she meets the girlfriend and oh boy she is in trouble. Shallow. Though this DOES happen but it happens in 2 chapters! At the beginning! And once you\u2019ve finished it you can\u2019t even remember that scene! Here\u2019s how things go: Auden goes to spend her summer with her dad and her new wife and baby, Auden does not feel thrilled about this but, she\u2019ll be going off to college soon and so she goes visit her dad. Auden has been having trouble sleeping since the problems with her parents started and she finds that hard habits are hard to break, so she just lives thanks to coffee and keeps not sleeping. Soon she find herself working at a boutique with a bunch of girls that act like, well, teens and Auden has spent most of her teenage years trying to be perfect for her demanding mother instead of actually living a life and being, well, a teen. In the middle of her non-sleeping episodes, she meets Eli \u2013 because there\u2019s always a boy. A guy who seems haunted and that hides a secret from his past, but he is also in a mission to give Auden back her life and show her what she\u2019s missed out on and what she can still have. Soon they are spending every night together, setting out on different tasks, and also, learning how to ride a bike \u2013 at least Auden. Along for the ride is a lesson to let go, to always get back on that bike no matter how many times you fall, to go on a quest, and to enjoy the ride. This is my favorite Sarah Dessen Novel so far.

The next day I was nearly done with it and had found out who my new favorite author was. Now, switch back to current times, when I got the amazing chance to read an early copy of Along for the Ride. You could only guess how happy I was! Along for the Ride is truly another Sarah Dessen classic. Since, in this she creates another set of memorable characters and a story that you hung on it's every word, cherishing it until it was over. Auden was someone that I could relate to in her insomniac and overarching ways, though both are not nearly as bad, to her the feeling that her parents divorce was partly her fault. While she is not the strongest main character in a Dessen novel, she is still one that many girls will come to adore. Then, there was Eli, who was incredible. Defiantly one of my top three faves in top male leads in a Deseen book. I loved Auden and his journeys in the night since they always brought for a laugh or two. The plot in this is basic and predictable, though with Sarah's writing she added a charm to it that not many others would be able to do. One of my favorite parts of this novel was about the different relationships you make in life: between friends, parents, siblings, ex. It was interesting to see how Auden dealt with them and let them grow. One issue I want to address in this review is how some have said that this is basically a collaboration of some of her previous novels, though with new characters. Yes, some of the scenes and issues in Along for the Ride were a bit similar to previous novels such as This Lullabay and The Truth About Forever, but that happens with any type of novel. Since, most novels are mainly based on the same basics: relationships, first loves, friendships, ex. Overall, Along for the Ride is one of my favorite Sarah Dessen novels so far! I deeply suggest you go pick this book up form your local book store come June 16!

Auden decides to spend her last summer before starting university with her newly re-married father, his exuberant young wife and their baby daughter after she receives a frame from her brother with the inscription \"The Best Of Times\". Suddenly, Auden finds that she has nothing to live up to that inscription. And that is what prompts her to make a change, move to a small seaside town and try herself at normal teenage life. And for a girl who has no social experiences (and I mean none at all), this summer would become a turnaround point in her life. By the end of the book I went from absolutely hating her self-absorbed parents to hoping they'd change, from scoffing at her pink-loving stepmother to respecting her, from shaking my head at her brother's antics to actually adoring them. I loved how Auden became friends with three very diferent girls, all of which were interesting on their own. And I adored Eli - how he decided to do all sort of stupid things to help Auden make up for her lost childhood. Along for the Ride is a funny, dynamic, realistic read, in which the characters deal with the moral and social problems of present days - the parents who take no notice of their children, workaholism, kids studying too much instead of playing with others, the tragic loss of life. Most of all, it makes the reader think about the truly important thigs in life - the ones that stay with you, whether they be bright memories of happy, crazy times, or the people who care for you and stand by your side.

Even Eli's mother, Karen Stock, sails I and is super mom to both Heidi and her baby. All great, interesting characters. Don't get me wrong,they almost all have their flaws and problems. Otherwise, we wouldn't have much of a story. The male characters on the other hand were mostly weak in my opinion. Auden's father once again checks out of being a husband and father after the birth of his new daughter. Auden's brother Hollis has been backpacking his way around the world, avoiding any real life responsibilities (until he meets Laura, another strong female character). Eli pretty much shuts down his life after his best friend died. I'm not saying he shouldn't be devastated but he has stopped doing everything, avoiding his friends, passed on going to college.

If that makes sense. The side characters, Maggie, Adam, Leah, Heidi, etc and Eli. Oh Eli. I was torn trying to decide whether to give this a 4 or 5 and thought, I don't care, this is a 5 star for me. Plus when I got to the last page, I had a big smile on my face alright, with a little butterflies and feels thank you very much. So yeah, glad I gave this one a shot, thinking I wasn't going to like for some reason and found myself liking the slow pace and slow build of the friendship and experiences Auden goes through. All the while getting help along the way. Also I like the cover, its actually relevant to the story. Really good read. ...more I can't believe I am giving this book 4/5 stars, but it was such a light summer read!", "Title": "Along for the Ride"},
