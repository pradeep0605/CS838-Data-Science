Beneath, I think it's about how time slips away and the deeper the rut you get into, the harder it is to get out and do something new. His Kingship picked a good tale to start the collection with. Gingerbread Girl: After leaving her husband, Emily takes up running on the beach. Her life is turning around until she runs afoul of killer! This was a pretty gripping tale about a woman running for her life from a serial killer. Serial killers have been done to death but King makes a good tale out of it. Harvey's Dream: A woman in a boring marriage is surprised when her husband wants to share a dream of his with her. This one felt like a well-written Twilight Zone episode to me. The characters felt very real to me. Rest Stop: A writer on the way home stops at a rest area to pee and interrupts a man beating his wife.<---F> This one was okay</---F>. It dealt a little with identity but was mostly a writer gathering up the courage to do something about a bad situation. Stationary Bike: An overweight commercial artist gets a stationary bike. Twilight Zone style weirdness ensues. Yeah, I kind of liked this but it was a little long for what it was. Stationary bike takes guy into his drawing, guys working inside his body to keep his body healthy, it was a strange ride that ultimately went nowhere. See what I did there? The Things They Left Behind: Mysterious objects appear in a 9/11 survivor's apartment, objects belonging to his deceased co-workers. Another Twilight Zone-ish story that should have been a lot shorter. Graduation Afternoon: A young woman knows she's attending one of her boyfriend's family's gatherings for the last time. It turns out being the last in more ways than one. Meh. N: A psychiatrist commits suicide and his sister reads the file on his last patient, an OCD man named N. Holy shit! I enjoyed the hell out of this one. An OCD guy's rituals keeping a world devouring monster straight out of H.P. Lovecraft at bay? Loved it! The Cat From Hell: A pharmaceutical millionaire hires a hitman to kill... a cat? Pretty brutal. You can tell this one was early King, especially compared to the writing style of the other stories. No wonder it was featured in Tales from the Dark Side: The Movie. The New York Times at Special Bargain Rates: A woman gets an unexpected phone call from her dead husband. Yawn. Another plane crash-related tale. King's getting soft in his old age. Mute: After finding out his wife has been having an affair, a man picks up a deaf-mute hitchhiker and bares his soul. But was the man really deaf? This confessional tale was pretty good. King likes his shorts Twilight Zone-ish, doesn't he? Ayana: This was a tale about miracles. It was a little Hallmark-y for my taste. A Very Tight Place: A guy gets trapped inside a Johnny-On-The-Spot by his vindictive neighbor. This was a revenge story that wasn't shitty despite the setting. Closing Thoughts: Not a bad short story collection. N and the Cat from Hell were my favorites. I wouldn't say any of the stories were duds but this wasn't my favorite King collection. Three out of five stars. ...more This was kinda hit and miss for me.

I\u2019m here to talk about my favorite Stephen King collection since \u201cNight Shift\u201d - \u201c<+++>Just After Sunset</+++>\u201d. If you knew me, I wouldn\u2019t have to say how big a King fanboy I am but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll provide enough evidence of my fandom before we\u2019re done. Settle in, Constant Reader, and let me tell you a story. I grew up surrounded by Stephen King. My mother was a huge fan, one who needed every new release on the day it dropped. I have fond memories of standing in line with her, waiting to purchase her copies of \u201cIt\u201d, and later, \u201cThe Tommyknockers\u201d. Then, years later, popping some corn and plopping down in the couch to watch the television adaptations of both of the aforementioned books. I recall cowering in the backseat\u2019s footwell while my mother and her best friend watched \u201cPet Sematary\u201d at the drive-in. Zelda\u2019s first appearance literally made me pee my pants. I was nine years old. King helped me bond with my mother, and to this day, a simple mention of one of his books brings back fond memories, like a treasured song. In that regard, Stephen King is my favorite band. One of my earliest memories tied to this collection (other than watching \u201cThe Cat from Hell\u201d in \u201cTales from the Darkside: The Movie\u201d, but we\u2019ll get to that) is from 2004. I was at Walden\u2019s Books and I came across a paperback entitled \u201cTales from the Borderlands\u201d, which was the fifth book in the Borderlands series. I only bought it because there was a brand new Stephen King tale at the end, \u201cStationary Bike\u201d. The multi-author collection was my first taste of authors like Bentley Little (an author I would seek out soon after and tear through his entire back catalog in under a year) and the late/great Tom Piccirilli. But the story I remember most is King\u2019s tale. Although Gary A. Braunbeck\u2019s story about recovering and rebuilding the face of God, \u201cRami Temporalis\u201d, is a great little ditty, too. While King is not without his faults (I\u2019m looking at you \u201cDreamcatcher\u201d and \u201cFrom a Buick Eight\u201d), I feel this collection is among his best work. King\u2019s previous collection, \u201cEverything\u2019s Eventual\u201d let me down. The only story I really enjoy and still reread from that one is \u201cThe Little Sisters of Eluria\u201d. The rest of the tales were time-wasters at best. I thought more than half the stories in \u201cNightmares and Dreamscapes\u201d were either just all right or boring; the other half are good fun, but nothing stellar. For a time, I thought the last well-balanced collection we would see was going to be \u201cSkeleton Crew\u201d, which has three of my all-time favourite King stories: \u201cThe Raft\u201d, \u201cThe Jaunt\u201d, and \u201cThe Mist\u201d. But the collections I always return to, the ones I can reread time and time again without skipping a single story, are \u201cNight Shift\u201d and \u201cJust After Sunset\u201d. While I will not be covering every single story in this collection, I will discuss the ones that pop into my mind without having to look at the Table of Contents. \u201cJust After Sunset\u201d showcases Stephen King\u2019s maturity of style and undying love of story. \u201cThe Gingerbread Girl\u201d and \u201cHarvey\u2019s Dream\u201d alone prove this. The stories could not be more different. \u201cHarvey\u2019s Dream\u201d is a literary nightmare ala Twilight Zone, whereas \u201cThe Gingerbread Girl\u201d is on par with some of the best suspense writing I\u2019ve read. Both of these stories rely heavily on strength of character, and character development is where King shines. Then we have King riffing on much the same idea in \u201cRest Stop\u201d and \u201cMute\u201d. Those two stories are interesting slices from the same cake \u2014 bad people doing good deeds. Then again, I guess that depends on what you consider to be a good deed. \u201cJust After Sunset\u201d also covers the longest period of creativity out of King\u2019s entire catalog. \u201cThe Cat From Hell\u201d is positively elderly in terms of King\u2019s career, which spans five publishers (Doubleday, Viking, and currently, Scribner, with a pit stop at Random House and two detours with Putnam) - all that, from 1974 to present day. \u201cThe Cat from Hell\u201d was first released in Cavalier, during King\u2019s years submitting to men\u2019s magazines, and then filmed as part of the nostalgia-inducing, probably-not-as-good-as-I-remember \u201cTales from the Darkside: The Movie\u201d. And, although I cannot be a hundred percent certain, the segment might have been my first taste of King. \u201cN.\u201d is the newest story, and probably my favorite. I\u2019m OCD, so I relate to the titular character. The ending is classic Uncle Stevie. I\u2019ve always been a fan of unhappy finishers, and King delivers them more often than not. Whether King is grossing us out with \u201cA Very Tight Place\u201d (my second favorite story in this collection, because I like my fiction to affect me in some way, and the what-if in this tale is one of my worst nightmares) or aiming to bring tears to our eyes with \u201cThe Things They Left Behind\u201d, he hits the mark with each and every story offered in \u201cJust After Sunset\u201d. Finally, I love that King has always been honest with us about the quality of his work. He admits that the stinkers from his career actually do stink, but when asked which of his own works he loves the most, he\u2019s been quoted saying \u201cIsn\u2019t it funny how your own farts smell the best?\u201d I think he feels much the same way about \u201cWilla\u201d, the first story in the collection (and my least favorite), because he opens the afterword with the explanation, \u201cThis probably isn\u2019t the best story in the book, but I love it very much\u2026\u201d And that\u2019s how I feel about \u201cJust After Sunset\u201d. You might not agree with me when I say this is one of King\u2019s best collections, but I love it very much. ...more Oh, that age has gone. Oh yeah. Totally. For the last novel with any ounce of originality still left in it by Stephen King was surely the serial-then-(underrated)novel \"The Green Mile.\" And now? Now is the age of rehash (boo \"Doctor Sleep\"... boo boo BOO!) with an originality factor that registers at about 0.07%. Therefore yes; this ain't too bad at all, but it's no good either.

This is a total miss for me, for I pretty much KNOW, am certain that the writer actually manages to flourish in the short story department. (There are more, if not an equal number of, movies based on Stephen King short stories than his novels.) So for a vastly better collection of short stories, in the new and sad age of King-imitating-King, just do yourself a favor & choose \"Everythings Eventual\" instead. ...more There are two \"eras\" of Stephen King: before and after he got clean and sober. Like quite a few of his fans, some of my favorite King novels are the ones he wrote during his coke-fiend days, when he was just writing whatever crazy shit ran amok through his booze-addled brain. Even back then, his stories were coherent and compellingly written, if sloppy at times and sometimes giving the impression of a train about to go off its rails at any moment. But I really like the old King classics. That is There are two \"eras\" of Stephen King: before and after he got clean and sober.

But I really like the old King classics. That is not to say I don't like the \"new\" King. He's perfected his craft and he can write much calmer, more thoughtful stories. But he can still write some crazy shit. So, Just After Sunset is not Skeleton Crew or Night Shift . Most of the horror is not as raw in this collection, but King spends more time on characterization or just playing with scenes. However, when one story stood out to me \u2014 The Cat from Hell \u2014 and made me think \"Now that's the old King,\" I was gratified when he mentioned in his author's notes at the end of the book that it was one of the stories he wrote for a men's magazine 30 years ago that just hadn't happened to make it into any of his previous short story collections. So here are the stories: Willa is a sad, touching ghost story. That's a little bit of a spoiler, but come on, you've seen Sixth Sense , and anyway, King doesn't make you wait until the end. Great mood, though the story was unremarkable. The Gingerbread Girl is your basic survival thriller, a woman versus a maniac serial killer in the Florida Keys. Harvey's Dream is a story that begins as a mundane examination of your basic unhappily married middle-aged couple, and slowly edges towards horror. Rest Stop , about a traveler who stops at a rest stop and is unwillingly involved in a domestic dispute. King has always written with sympathy although not much finesse about women who are victims of abuse. Stationary Bike This is reminiscent of the old \"weird King,\" where the mundane turns bizarre. A guy trying to lose weight spends hours on a stationary bike and literally goes into another world. Graduation Afternoon A short short, about a townie girl dating one of the wealthy summer tourists, and a King twist at the end. The Things They Left Behind Every American writer in the 21st century has to write a 9/11 story at some point, and this is King's. N. King always has to give a nod to Lovecraft, and this is this collection's \"unspeakable horror from between worlds\" story. The New York Times at Special Bargain Rates is a brief, eerie tale about a woman who receives a phone call from her husband, who died two days ago. Mute A man unburdens himself about his marital woes to a deaf-mute hitchhiker, with disastrous results. The Cat From Hell A hit man accepts a contract on... a cat. Ayana About a little girl with healing powers. This one kind of annoyed me, because King just cannot break his Magical Negro habit. And finally, in another hat-tip to his older, grosser self, A Very Tight Place . The \"very tight place\" referred to is a porta-potty. Combine \"porta-potty\" with \"Stephen King\" and a title like that, and you know it's going to go bad places. Don't read it while eating, but it's a pretty satisfying survival-and-revenge tale. Overall, I give this collection 3.5 stars as the stories ranged from 3 to 4 stars for me \u2014 no stand-outs, but no real duds. King fans should find it perfectly satisfying, and it's pretty representative of his late-career writing style. ...more \u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae \u03b7 \u03c0\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1

I've heard so many people critique Stephen King by saying that his books are always long and he needs editing.

And this book once again proves that he's one of the top dogs of the short fiction format. This might actually be one of my favorite Stephen King short story collections (and yes I've pretty much read all of them)! This is his collection with the strongest, most cohesive themes connecting each story. Many of the stories have to do with accepting and overcoming death and loss. There's also a definite influence by 9/11 events in many of the stories. There's a lot less pure horror in here than many expect from King. But that's not to say that King has lost his touch for the macabre. \"The Cat from Hell\" reads like something that would have been right at home in his first collection, Night Shift , and the most popular work from the collection: the fabulous novella \"N.\", is a creepy tale of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder told in the intriguing epistolary format that ultimately takes a Lovecraftian turn. But there are also some very quiet, tender, and beautifully written pieces here, like the first story \"Willa\". I liked almost all the stories in this collection. The only one that I was not all that keen on is another popular one from the set, \"Stationary Bike\". It just didn't grab me. My favorites here include: the beautiful \"The New York Times at Special Bargain Rates\", the brilliantly suspenseful \"A Very Tight Place\", \"Willa\", \"N.\", \"Harvey's Dream\", and \"The Things They Left Behind\" ...more Just After Sunset is a collection of 13 short stories. Some of the stories in this book are excellent whereas some are not that good and some are just a waste of time. Stephen King explores the deep and dark corners of one's mind in these 13 unusual stories. My favourite one is story #8: 'N.' It's really creepy and I totally freaked out. This story begins and ends with a letter and at the end you really feel helpless as you know what's going to happen. This story still gives me goosebumps.

This story begins and ends with a letter and at the end you really feel helpless as you know what's going to happen. This story still gives me goosebumps. It's actually King's narrative that plays the trick. I loved the way he played with the idea of extreme level of OCD. The fact that I have OCD, really made the reading relative. The second best from the lot is 'Mute'. This is also a nice short story with strong narrative. I loved it's ending (which I'm not gonna discuss here!) The description of situations makes you feel everything. These two stories really deserve 5/5. I hate to say this, but reading 'Harvey's Dream' and 'Graduation Afternoon' is a waste of time. If you wanna save your time, you can totally omit these two stories. 'Willa' was much better then these two but still was a disappointment at the end. Rest of the stories are worth reading. Following are the ratings for all the 13 stories individually: Willa: ** The Gingerbread Girl:**** Harvey's Dream: * Rest Stop: *** Stationary Bike: **** The Things They Left Behind: ***** Graduation Afternoon: ** N.: ***** The Cat From Hell: **** The New York Times at Special Bargain Rates: **** Mute: ***** Ayana: **** A Very Tight Place: ***** You can also read this review at The Reading Bud ...more Just After Sunset is Stephen King's latest collection of short stories, containing a hodge podge of different tales that with one exception had been previously published in various magazines or anthologies.

I've liked Stephen King's similar works in the past, despite the fact that some of his so-called short stories have clocked in at novella or even full novel length. This collection, however, contains relatively short works that can all be easily read in one sitting. Unfortunately I didn't care for hardly any of them. What we have here seems to be more like a collection of literary doodles or proof of concepts that just kind of fell out of King's brain. Most of them seem like either short little vignettes that don't seem to have much point or outlines for larger works that King never quite got around to fleshing out. You know, the kind of thing that you might find in the last 50 pages of a full-length novel after he'd spent hundreds of pages building character, place, backstory, and tension. Only one of the stories, N., really did anything for me. It's King's homage-slash-fanfiction for H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos where he links obsessive-compulsive disorder with rituals that in reality keep otherworldly horrors at bay for the select few that are unlucky enough to be chosen as guardians for the \"thin places\" between worlds. It's a really neat concept, and he executes it well. On the other hand, one of the other stories, Stationary Bike is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen put down on paper. Really, it's incredibly stupid. So, it's going to be hard for me to recommend this one unless you're a Stephen King completionist like myself. ...more A significant portion of my 'free' time outside the book is on the internet.

Needless to say, Facebook is the main culprit there. The best part of Facebook to me has always been the outstanding quotes & images shared by my friends. Why this diversion here in this review you might wonder ! Here is why : A good life must be like a good short story. A solid beginning, interesting characters, strong setup, suspenseful episodes, pleasant twists, fulfilling resolution and the end shouldn't really matter. This was lifted off a friend's wall & came to my mind as I sat down to key in my review for this book. It was a conscious decision on my part to go through all of Stephen King's oeuvre of short fiction. Just after sunset is my second stop on the line. Here is what the book has : Willa : A rag tag bunch of men & women in a small time town in America. King explores death after life as seen in this little slice of the world. I found the overall atmosphere of the tale to be good along with the characters but the premise felt not fully explored. This does not score high on my list and I shall most probably remember this as a world left not fully mapped out. The gingerbread girl : Trauma coupled with the slow unsettling feeling that seeps into a married couple's lives is the diving board for this tale. The starting off and the slow buildup of Emily's life patterns are very well sketched. It slowly tailors in a look at the evil in the minds of human beings and how the will to survive can overcome most odds. The beauty of the tale lies in the little details and not in its climax or in the inevitable triumph of good over evil. I finished this the fastest even though it was the longest story in the collection. Rest Stop : Towards the end of the book, in the notes part the author writes of how he could personally associate with this story & his alter ego of Richard Bachman. This story however turned out to be not my cup of tea ! Harvey's Dream : Except for its vivid portrayal of a marriage at the verge of deflation, this was a bland one. Stationary Bike : I would pick this as the best from the collection. There is a slow buildup and the laying bare of a slightly derailed mind and it's the little things that drive an absolutely common man over the edge. It is the more or less nonsensical yet riveting plot that caught my attention full on. The things they left behind : I have never read a post 9/11 story set in New York before. This lack of exposure made this a very touching tale for me. It is very human in the situations that the lead character has to go through and made it a good one. Graduation Afternoon : A short & sweet one with a tinge of the apocalypse. N : I read this under the assumption that it is a homage to Lovecraft. I even kept finding references to Ctulhu even when there were none ! It was only when I read the notes section that I understood that the homage was to Arthur Machen's Great God Pan which I have not read. The horror has the old school feel to it and is quite effective in places but not as a whole. The cat from hell : I dimly remember reading this one alone a long time ago in an ebook format. The best part for me was the scene akin to the chestburster from Alien . Ayana : Well, nothing much to write home about this one ! A very tight place : The central theme of the story is one which King goes over with a fine toothed comb. This tends to be a repulsive variant of a story which all of us come across at one point or another of our reading trips. Not many shakes here either ! To sum it up, I put this at a 3-star rating. Like many an anthology, it is a mix of the good, the bad and the dud ! ...more I love Stephen King stories. There are lots of authors I read, but few that I am as eager to consume as any new work by King (Elizabeth George is a close second). Any new offering by King is a cause for celebration for me. \"Just After Sunset\" is King's latest collection of short stories, written over a period of about two years. Thematically, several of the stories look at what happens to us in the moments and years after we shuffle off this mortal coil and several of them are heavily impacted by I love Stephen King stories.

Thematically, several of the stories look at what happens to us in the moments and years after we shuffle off this mortal coil and several of them are heavily impacted by the real-life horrors of 9/11. No, King doesn't take advantage or exploit the day for commercial gain. Instead, he examines the implications on those left behind in the wake of the tragedy. One haunting story finds a man who was running late the morning of 9/11 and who worked in the Twin Towers, finding objects from his lost office and co-workers turning up in is apartment. He tries to get rid of them, but they keep returning to him. He then decides he has to bring them to the families to offer those families a bit of closure--even if it's from something as out there as a novelty ice cube or a whoopie cushion. Another story finds a widow being able to connect with her husband who dies in a plane crash. The husband was calling on his cell phone as the plane went down and now finds himself in a limbo, waiting area. His phone is slowly dying and he laments he didn't take the time to charge it the night before in order to be able to talk longer before he passes onward. The story doesn't say or really imply that it's related to any of the crashes of 9/11, but it's hard not to read that into any story about a plane crash after that fateful day. As always, the strength of King's stories is their grounding in reality with strong characters reacting in authentic ways to bizarre and supernatural circumstances. King has, in my mind, long since moved out of the realm of a simple horror novelist and inhabits a place as simply a great storyteller. Yes, he can and does tap into some of the more twisted and bizarre visions or our time, but he always does so in such a way as to make the stories work and feel real, even when the supernatural element is turned up to the n-th degree. These stories are about death--as is a lot of King's work--and how we react to it. Will we be like \"The Gingerbread Girl\" who flees from life in the wake of the death of her child? She literally begins running away from the problem before come face to face with an even greater evil and horror that snaps her back into survival mode and where she finds the will to live. Or will we be like those who ghosts who have died, inhabiting a strange camp and dance hall, going through the same motions over and over again, denying that we've left this mortal coil and refusing to embrace or accept what can or does come next? It's not to say that every story in this collection is perfect. Some work better than others and there are one or two stories that just didn't connect with me and enthrall me as much as I'd hoped. But in a collection of short stories, odds are that is going to happen. But when King is on in this collection, his stories are as compelling and engrossing as any author out there today. ...more I'm giving this book four stars with one exclusion, to be discussed later in the review. Overall, a great, versatile collection. Over the years King has moved away from monsters and vampires and gore and moved into the realm of psychological boogie men and supernatural possibilities. Some of these stories don't have anything otherworldly in them at all. Just regular old human beings are scary enough. I really liked: 1)Mute: Real life horror with nothing supernatural, and very believable. Outstandi I'm giving this book four stars with one exclusion, to be discussed later in the review.

I really liked: 1)Mute: Real life horror with nothing supernatural, and very believable. Outstanding story, if slightly predictable. 2)The Things They Left Behind: This one is not scary in the least. Just slightly supernatural and sweet. It's a little tribute to those who perished in the Twin Towers. I recommend this story for everyone, even if they don't like Stephen King. 3)The Gingerbread Girl: I loved the way he portrayed a strong, fit, smart, capable woman fighting back every step of the way. 4)Stationary Bike: I listened to this on audio a while back when that was the only way it was available. I'd forgotten what a clever and inventive story it is. And of course, much more fun to read in print. It's also a good reminder that it's okay to enjoy some unhealthy foods in moderation. 5)Willa: Nothing spectacular, but really sweet and makes you think about who might be in your midst that you can't see. I liked all the other stories, too. EXCEPT: Do NOT read the very last story in the book. Terrible, in poor taste, I'm disgusted. That story is the only thing written by Stephen King that I've ever started and not finished. I got about halfway through and was too disgusted to continue.

Still good...just not great. Another nice surprise was the 2008 collection of King shorts! My friends perception of this one was less than stellar (even if some really liked it) and for some reason I went in with a bit low (for King anyway) expectations. I needn't have - even if like most collections it has ups as well as not-so-ups, there was no story I didn't care for at all and quite a few I really liked! All in all a good read.

The stories: Willa - Started out very odd, I almost doubled back to see if I missed something when suddenly things became clear for me. Took a while longer for the fog to lift for the characters in the story. Good, bittersweet and sad. Gingerbread Girl - As I said in my update, it is obvious that SK was never a runner. If you are you know what I mean. The story took a quick turn for the nasty that was a bit unexpected. Nothing really new - I got thinking of Wood's Palindrome (but I haven't read that for ages, so don't hold me to it - and King's own Rose Madder of course. Nothing really new here, but it does come to a satisfactory conclusion. Harvey's Dream - A short, twilight zone-feeling one. Rest Stop - Another writer pseudonym? OK, the story is a short one and it works. I did wait for twist that never came, but then I realized I really liked it better for it. Stationary bike - There's probably not a Swede older than 30 that reads this and not thinks about Magnus H\u00e4renstam's genius skit \"Verkm\u00e4staren i magen\" (The mechanic of the stomach). Probably my least favorite of this collection, still quite readable. The things they left behind - This is creepy, effective and very sad. Graduation afternoon - I did not expect that happening! N. - This was a good and creepy one, but I did expect that happening! The cat from hell - Got almost all the way through this before I realized what I was reading. Filmed in 1990, this 70's story sticks out. But it's good! The New York Times at special bargain rates - My favorite of the lot, scary but gentle! Mute - Another top one! Be careful what you wish for (even if you do see ups with the result) Ayana - I really like this one! Green mile without the capital punishment and the halting explanations. No explanations is obviously the way to go! A very tight place - Could not get enough of the Shawshank Redemtion escape route? Cram yourself in right here. Quite painful reading and with not a great ending. Again, quite readable. ...more \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0641\u0643\u0627\u0631 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u0635\u064a\u0629 \u062c\u0627\u0626\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f \u062d\u062f\u062b\u062a \u0641\u064a \u062d\u064a\u0627\u062a\u0647\u060c\u062e\u0628\u0631 \u0642\u0631\u0623\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0648 \u062d\u0627\u062f\u062b\u0629 \u0633\u0645\u0639 \u0628\u0647\u0627. \u0645\u0639\u0638\u0645 \u0642\u0635\u0635 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639\u0629 \u062c\u064a\u062f\u0629\u060c\u0644\u064a\u0633\u062a \u0645\u0631\u0639\u0628\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0631\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0644\u064a \u060c\u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0623\u0643\u064a\u062f \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627 \u0648\u063a\u0627\u0645\u0636\u0629 \u0644\u062f\u0631\u062c\u0629 \u062a\u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0645\u0639\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0646. \u062a\u062c\u0631\u0628\u0629 \u0641\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0648\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0639\u0629 \u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639\u0629 \u0642\u0635\u0635\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0642\u0631\u0623\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0633\u062a\u064a\u0641\u0646 \u0643\u064a\u0646\u062c \u0631\u063a\u0645 \u0634\u0639\u0648\u0631\u064a \u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u0635 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0633\u062a\u062d\u0642 \u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0637\u0648\u064a\u0644\u0629.

The Things They Left Behind : Again, another one that evokes a kind of melancholy spooky sadness. Graduation Afternoon : Forgettable. I honestly had forgotten about it completely until I looked back at the table of contents to write my review. N. : Favorite story winner!

Willa read by Holter Graham Willa and David are stranded at a train station with a bunch of other folks while they await the next train. Willa, apparently bored and sick of the whining people around her, wanders away (who can blame her?). When David realizes she\u2019s gone, he ponders waiting for her to come back or taking a chance on missing the train and trekking out to find her despite the warning that there are \u201cwolves\u201d in the area. David eventually puts on his Big Boy Pants and heads out to find her but soon discovers that wolves are the least of his worries. This is a morose story about folks who refuse to see the truth when it\u2019s right in front of them but it\u2019s also about two people who make the best of a terrible situation. I liked it a lot, especially the end. The narrator was very good at getting the right tone that was perfect for the mood of the story. The Gingerbread Girl read by Mare Winningham Emily is having a very difficult time coming to terms with the unexpected crib death of her baby girl. Instead of working through her grief, she runs. She runs until her body gives out. Her behavior has ruined her relationship with her husband who doesn\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t grieve like a normal person. She realizes it\u2019s over when he accuses her of being obsessed and instead of being upset, she can only think: \u201cGiven his rather long face, it was like having a sheep in the house. I married a Dorset gray, she thought, and now it's just baa-baa-baa, all day long. But she tried one more time to be reasonable about something she knew in her heart had no reasonable core.\u201d Haha, I love King\u2019s knack for funny descriptions even in the darkest of times. Needless to say she runs far from him soon after and relocates to her dad\u2019s summer place where she stumbles across something horrifying. The story switches gears here and turns into a tense survival tale. It was a wee bit meandering before picking up but I enjoyed all of the character background and strong, resourceful Emily. Mare Winningham changes her tone from that of a depressed woman to a desperate one without a hitch. Harvey\u2019s Dream read by Stephen King Janet and Harvey have been married for ages. Now in their early 60\u2019s, their children are grown and Janet is whining to herself about how routine and boring their lives have become. She\u2019s dreading Harvey\u2019s impending retirement and pictures him sitting around, man-boobs on full display, demanding his breakfast every day for the rest of her life. But Janet soon regrets her mean thoughts when Harvey begins to recount a dream that woke him the previous night. Harvey\u2019s Dream is about a mundane world rocked by impending dread. I saw where it was going right along with Janet (I was supposed to) but poor Harvey remained clueless until the very end. Stephen King reads this piece and he does a good job, nasally voice and all. Rest Stop read by Denis O\u2019Hare This story just didn\u2019t grab me. It\u2019s about an English Professor with who makes his real money writing murder mysteries under a pen name. His identities start getting a little mixed up when he stops at a rest stop and stumbles upon a domestic violence scene in action. Should he help or sit on his thumbs until the wife and her unborn child are beaten to death? Will the other personality take over and take of business? This is a story that I feel like I\u2019ve read million times before, many of them probably penned by King himself. It\u2019s about an author who begins to confuse his \u201cidentities\u201d but it\u2019s a bit of a dud and I didn\u2019t like the protagonist much at all. It wasn\u2019t scary or even very interesting but looking on the bright side, it was over quickly and read skillfully. Stationary Bike read by Ron McLarty Richard\u2019s long overdue physical finds him getting a talking-to by his doctor. He needs to change his lifestyle or he\u2019ll suffer some ugly side effects from his poor diet and lazy habits. He purchaes a stationary bike and puts it in the basement facing a blank wall. Exercising this way is boring as hell so he paints a scene on the wall. Eventually his sanity starts to crack as he spends long hours on the bike without realizing it, travelling paths only in his mind. Or are they? I really enjoyed this story because Richard is such sympathetic character. He\u2019s 38, has lost his wife to cancer and has gained too much weight. He lives a solitary life and begins to spend far too much time in his own head. He\u2019s a decent guy whose good deeds, be they imaginary or not, backfire as his reality unravels. And the ending? It was perfect. I find Ron McLarty\u2019s voice hypnotizing, as always. Graduation Afternoon read by Jill Eickenberry I don\u2019t know what to think about this super short story about a high school student who witnesses New York City go up in flames. It was too brief to have any real impact but it was read with emotion. *Note: King says later in his \u201cSunset Notes\u201d that this story came to him in a dream years before the 9/11 attacks. This is a bit terrifying! The Things They Left Behind read by Ben Shenkman This story takes place post 9/11 and has damn fine narration. Scott is a survivor of the attack on the Twin Towers and is suffering from untreated survivor guilt. When belongings of his deceased co-workers start to appear in his apartment they bring with them a rush of painful memories. The items haunt him and he can\u2019t seem to get rid of them until a neighbor makes a suggestion that sets him on a mission. This is a sad story, especially since so much of it is clearly based on real events, but leave it to King to throw in some of his corny dialogue to lighten up the tone. \u201cHis father put an egg in his shoe and beat it.\u201d Hardy har har. King you are a silly devil. \u201cN\u201d read by several narrators This is story about a circle of stones that must be maintained by a keeper in order to keep terrible monsters at bay that would threaten the world. I enjoyed this tale of order and OCD and how madness slowly infects each \u201ckeeper\u201d of the beasties. The NY Times at Special Discount Rates read by Jill Eickenberry This is another brief tale about a widow who receives a call from her deceased husband. He gives her some advice and she\u2019d be wise to take it . . . Despite its brevity this is one that lingered with me . It gives a little glimpse into the afterlife and I thought it was a very sweet tale of kindness extended from beyond the grave. Mute read by Skipp Sudduth A travelling salesman, whose life is falling apart, throws caution to the wind and picks up a mute hitchhiker whom he spills all of his woes. Who better than a guy who can\u2019t respond in any way, right? Wrong! I found this story incredibly interesting and the dark ending was perfection. I think King may have even been poking a little fun at himself (or his critics) at one point because a character says, \u201cI\u2019m finding your story interesting but wondering if we could move it along.\u201d I didn\u2019t have that feeling here but I\u2019d be a liar if I said he never rambled on in some of these tales. The Cat from Hell read by Holter Graham I had a little feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu while reading this story about a cat from hell and the hit man hired to kill it and bring back its tail. I could\u2019ve sworn I had seen a horror movie that contained one very unforgettable scene from this fun and nasty piece of work. Turns out I was right. King states in his \u201cSunset Notes\u201d that this story was adapted to film for the 1990 horror anthology movie version of \u201cTales From the Darkside\u201d. Now I\u2019ll have to look it up and view it again because this story was great. Ayana read by George Guidall This is a lovely story that explores the reason why some people die and others are brought back from the brink of death to live out their lives. It\u2019s haunting, a little sad and was one of my favorites in this collection. George Guidall\u2019s voice is perfectly matched to the words. A Very Tight Place read by Ron McLarty If poopy fiction makes you squirm you might want to skip this one. I\u2019m not kidding when I say it is gross-nasty. King takes great joy in flinging poo on his unlucky protagonist. Read it at your own peril. Curtis is still reeling and unable to find joy after the death of his best friend. He (rightfully) blames the nasty, homophobic, Mother F-er next door for the death. Curtis has been in a battle with him over some property that they both believe they own and the MoFo, having recently suffered a series of setbacks, is now completely off his nut and blames all of his troubles on Curtis. Extreme nastiness ensues. Poo flies, the flies buzz and a well fed roach shows up to top off this craptastic extravaganza. This story was fascinating despite the gleeful grossness the author revels in. I felt terribly for poor Curtis and was a wee bit disappointed with the way his revenge was eventually meted out. I was hoping things would get much nastier but I\u2019m mean like that. Sunset Notes read by Stephen King King pops in at the end of the audio to add his thoughts about his writing process for each story. I loved getting that insight. He says he put them at the end because people like to complain about spoilers and usually those who complain the loudest about the spoilers are those who are spoiled. For some reason that made me laugh out loud. ...more Warning! This review will be incredibly long because I find it impossible to review a collection of short stories without reviewing each story.

This story was just sort of eerie. King is so great at setting a mood that you realize right away that something's not quite right, but mostly this story just felt like page filler. \"The Gingerbread Girl\"--5 stars--A young woman runs to escape her grief, and then a nightmare. This one was straight-up suspense. I found my shoulders tensed and my body hunched over as I read this one. It's amazing to me that an author can do that in so few pages. \"Harvey's Dream\"--3 stars--A man on the brink of retirement tells his wife about a terrible dream he had the night before. It was well-written, but I just didn't care. \"Rest Stop\"--4 stars--A mild mystery writer overhears a disturbing argument at a rest stop late one night and must decide what to do about it. This one left me wondering what I would do in his shoes. There's some exploration of the hidden depths we carry around inside that we hope we never tap into. A good \"makes-you-think\" story. \"Stationary Bike\"--A man creates more than he thinks when he paints himself a picture to help pass the time as he rides his stationary bike. I had no idea where this was going. And who can't relate to the mind-numbing boredom of an exercise machine? \"The Things They Left Behind\"--5 stars--My favorite story from this book. A man who should have died along with the rest of his office on 9/11 suddenly finds objects in his apartment that he associates with his co-workers. This was a quietly powerful story that had much more going on than meets the eye. It read like a good exploration of survivor's guilt. Don't dismiss this one as \"just another Stephen King story.\" This one's Literature. I actually pulled some good quotes out of this one: \"Obliqueness is the curse of the reading class.\" \"They did it in the name of God, but there is no God. If there was a God, Mr. Staley, He would have struck them dead in their boarding lounges with their boarding passes in their hand, but no God did. They called for passengers to get on and those fucks just got on.\" If we're being honest, who among us didn't feel that, at least for a second, on that day? \"Graduation Afternoon\"--4 stars--The unthinkable happens in New York City. This was probably one of the most truly scary stories in the book. Before 9/11, this would have just been a fantasty/horror story. Post-9/11, I think deep down we're all waiting for this to actually happen, at least in our darkest, most pessimistic hours. \"N.\"--4 stars--A psychiatrist leaves behind notes on a delusional patient. King mentions the story, \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" in this story. That \"descending-into-madness-with-the-character\" feeling seems to be what he was going for, but he didn't accomplish it like Charlotte Perkins Gilman did. This was supposed to be a horror tale, but I somehow never quite got there. The fantasy world was never very real to me. I don't know if that's because King's writing fell short or because my imagination is not the equal of his. \"The Cat From Hell\"--4 stars--The title describes the plot. This was an absurd, but at the same time scary, story. It reminded me of that Chattering Teeth story he wrote in an earlier collection in that I wanted to laugh at the same time that I was freaked out. \" The New York Times at Special Bargain Rates\"--3 stars--A woman receives a phone call from her husband--as she's dressing for his funeral. This was another one where all I have to say is that I really didn't care. \"Mute\"--3 stars--A man whose life has just fallen apart picks up a deaf/mute hitchhiker and feels safe confessing all his troubles. I found this one pretty predictable. But here's a quote that made me giggle: \"He pointed toward the silhouettes on the side of the [bathrooms] instead--black cutout man, black cutout woman. The man had his legs apart, the woman had hers together. Pretty much the story of the human race in sign language.\" \"Ayana\"--3 stars--All I'm going to say about this one is \" The Green Mile revisited.\" It might have been more interesting if I hadn't read the novel first. There was a good quote in here too though: \"The medical definition of miracle is misdiagnosis.\" \"A Very Tight Place\"--4 stars--Two neighbors are feuding over a piece of land in the Florida Keys. One of them decides to end the feud once and for all. This one was a good, old-fashioned, Stephen King gross-out. Don't read it if you have a weak stomach. ...more I'm reading this collection in bite-sized pieces, between novels every now and then. I'll review each story as I read them.

Pretty absorbing for a brief time. 3 stars The Things They Left Behind: King's nod to the 9/11 horror. It's obvious he spent a lot of time on this one given the sensitivity in its telling. Best story so far. 5 stars Graduation Afternoon: A very short look at a graduation that is backdropped with destruction. Interesting. 2 stars. N.: Predictable, but still a creepy decent into obsessive compulsion (I don't think anyone does this better than Stevie). 5 stars if only for the OCD slant. The Cat From Hell: Indeed. Very creepy and I enjoyed this one a lot. 4 stars Mute: A man in a confessional describes his car trip with a deaf-mute hitchhiker. This was pretty good, and a fine accompaniment to my lunch today. 3 stars. Ayana: A short story about miracles. It was OK. 2 stars. A Very Tight Place: Yuck.

My personal favorite of the batch, Lovecraftian pastiche is tough to do, King really gets it, and understands that Love Crafts stories don\u2019t work because of there archaic prose and creepy monsters but because they throw into such stunning relief how fragile our world is. -The Cat From Hell A welcome visit from Night Shift era King. -\u2018s -Willa A few good images but mostly boring. - Stationary Bike, Harvey\u2019s Dream, Rest Stop, Graduation Afternoon, Mute: The problem with a lot of the story\u2019s in this collection is that they seem like first drafts. A bit shaggy dog. Say what you will about King but the man knows how to build narrative momentum and drive. So it\u2019s kind of shocking to see how little of it these stories posses and not in a good way either.

The Gingerbread Girl - I've always loved this story. Emily is such a strong woman and that's what this story is really about. It's about her remembering how strong she is and trusting herself again. Like a reset button after tragedy. We all need one. Harvey's Dream - This story was more about the internal voice of a marriage to me. A bit like Lisey's Story but more NOW. At one point Janet thinks \"I need to pluck Harvey's eyebrows again.\" and you just know you are watching real people, lead real lives, even if King did make them up! Rest Stop - Every single time I read this story I choke up. I know that's not the reaction King was going for, but I do it. Every. Single. Time. I hate the idea of being in a situation where I am witnessing something I should stop and being afraid to do so. This story is just a nightmare. Stationary Bike - I don't love this story on the page, but hearing Ron McLarty read it is a sublime experience. Even though I was reading from the page this time, I heard McLarty in my head. :D The Things They Left Behind - Again, not my favorite story. I'm sure it was much more cathartic for King to write than it was for me to read. Graduation Afternoon - I love this one! It's just so ordinary, and chugging along when all of a sudden...KABLAM! I bet I see the exact same image in my head that sparked the idea for King. N. - This is just creepy and uncomfortable and makes me feel like a wack job waiting to happen. I count things. I am pretty anal about where things belong. Am I really one of the crazy tribe? The Cat from Hell - This is just silly and fun and reminds me of a comic book or one of those silly stories you tell at sleepovers. The New York Times at Special Bargain Rates - This one is a heart breaker. Right now, my father-in-law is in hospice and this story literally hurt my heart to read. My mother-in-law will be lost and just one more call would be such a blessing. Mute - My absolute favorite of the whole bunch! This is like an M. Night Shamalayan movie. Talk about a mind blower. No one saw that ending coming the first time they read it. No one! Ayana - I must not have liked this the first time I read this book because I skipped it this time with absolutely no guilt. Had no interest. A Very Tight Place - Geez! Just geez!!!!!!!!!!!!! Take this and the Dreamcatcher shit weasels into consideration and you gotta wonder about Uncle Stevie's digestive track. 2008 -Of course I love everything the man writes, so I do not have an unbiased opinion, but I think this was a great collection. Some I have read before, but was happy to revisit them. I'm not sure if it was my mood, or the writing, but the Rest Stop actually made me tear up a little. I'm pretty sure that's not the reaction King was looking for... The last story was, oddly, terrifiying to me. My daughter plays a lot of soccer and there are always port-o-potties around. How scary, gross and disgusting would it be to be trapped in one?
