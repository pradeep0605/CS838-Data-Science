She\u2019s another time traveler like me, but she\u2019s from somewhere in the 2010\u2019s.\u201d The corner of Jamie\u2019s mouth twitched in a wry smile, \u201cAye, I do. I\u2019d say that lassie is drunk!\u201d he rubbed his knuckle on his long straight nose. Holding my hand up \u201cThat\u2019s because I am....very, very drunk. Ya see, I read another book *hic* in the series that has been written about your lives, <+++>A Breath of Snow and Ashes</+++>. Don\u2019t ask me how this is poshsible,<---M> I don\u2019t know</---M>, but it\u2019s most likely something to do with you messing about with time. Anyhow, just for funnzies I decided to make a drinking game out of the book, whenever you said \u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ\u201d I took a shot of whiskey since you all drink the stuff like water and I thought whatzz good fer the goose is good for the gander.......Haaaaaa.......weeee! \u201cWhy would you do that? Not a wise move if you asked me, I say that ALL the time.\u201d Said Claire. \u201cI KNOW! That was the point......Well, I didn\u2019t ask you Claire because I don\u2019t think you make the wisest choice with the whiskey yourself! By the way, who the hell do you think you are judging me about my alcohol consumption? Around here it\u2019s the answer for everything. Pregnant? Drink some whiskey. Just vomited from being sedated with homemade ether? Drink some whiskey. Been gang raped? Drink some whiskey....okay that one makes sense. Whatever is going on the answer is \u201cdrink more whiskey!!\u201d One has to admire that. It\u2019s a damn good thing that I didn\u2019t pick the words \u2018wry, knuckle, or rubbed\u2019 or I would be in an alcoholic coma or worse, dead.\u201d Jamie looked at me and narrowed his cat eyes \u201cIf our lives and the words the lady who writes these books uses bothers ya so much, why do ya keep reading them?\u201d The corner of his mouth twitched in a wry smile and he rubbed his long straight nose with his knuckle......again. \u201cThat\u2019s an excellent question Jamie and I don\u2019t have a good answer for you other then that I can\u2019t quit you.....either of you.\u201d *sigh* \u201cAwe Stephanie, that\u2019s so sweet I could cry. I think we need to drink to that!\u201d said Claire. \u201cSuuure\u2026..what\u2019s a little more whiskey gonna hurt at this point?\u201d Said I. Jamie pours us all a dram of whiskey, says something in Gallic, and we all drink it down in one swallow. He then rubs his long straight nose with his knuckle and smiles wryly. \u201cOne thing I can say in the positive about the authors\u2019, <---A>Diana Gabaldon</---A>, word choices is that she never ever uses the words \u2018throbbing\u2019 and \u2018member\u2019 together, and with all the sex scenes in all of these books that\u2019s saying something.\u201d *Blushes* \u201cShe writes about\u2026..mm hmm? What happens at night between me....and my wife?\u201d asks Jamie. \u201cOh sure\u2026between the two of you, and between Roger and Brianna, between any two people who may cross paths, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s why so many people read the books.\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s also obsessed with describing hair. Seriously how many times must we hear about hair? I know everything there is to know about everybody\u2019s hair in the history of ever. Yours Jamie is always a fire and Claire, you constantly have escaping curls.\u201d I said \u201cbut I guess that\u2019s better than the last book, The Fiery Cross, where Diana was obsessed with describing every detail about every dirty diaper, or clout as you call them, that adorable little angelic Gem produced. Forget about the obsession with lactating breasts\u2026..and sex with, around, and about lactating breasts\u2026..and the sticky aftermath. I couldn\u2019t even come back and talk to you about it, any review I tried to write just came out dirty, and not always in a good way.\u201d \u201cThat sounds disgusting.\u201d Said Claire. \u201cAt times it was\u201d I said. \u201cWell, I better get this thing back to its owner before he misses it.

It's a 3.5. There was a new time traveler from her time that enter the story and I was disappointed with how the author handled this character. There was a potential there for something really interesting and she decided to make the character boring instead. But overall it was entertaining. ...more The paperback edition of what is the sixth book in the Outlander series is over 1500 pages long and sorry to say, I did not hang on every word. Who could?

I could not even finish the fifth book, The Fiery Cross . As for Breath of Snow and Ashes , how many times can any handful of people escape from prison, mob scenes, near death, kidnappings, etc, etc. Maybe I'm just cranky because while I was reading this tome, I could have finished at least four other books on my to-read list. But I sacrificed, I persevered, and I wanted to LOVE this book, I really did. But alas, it was not meant to be. There was enough Jamie and Claire antics, and classic Gabaldon humor, to recommend this title, but only to hardcore Outlander fans. Remember, 1500 pages is a huge chunk of prose which translates into a huge investment of your precious reading time. Approach with caution. ...more 5 STARS!!!!!!!!! JESUS H. ROOSEVELT CHRIST!!!!!!

I can easily say that even through the explanation of many of the historical events that are occurring at the time, the continuous myriad of changing characters and situations, the medical explanation, and the constantly changing points of view... I never once... not once got bored. There was so much action packed into these thousand pages that I didn't regret a single one. I only have one book left, until the final book next summer, and then I will be sadly mourning my daily dose of Outlander. Diana Gabaldon...

If things slow down, one of the women gets kidnapped, raped or threatened with kidnap or rape, or all of the above. Which probably happened quite a bit in pre-revolutionary America. And then Jamie turns up and rescues everyone, and takes Claire to bed. Considering she's about 55 by now she's doing pretty darn well; they don't seem to go much longer than 3 days without a good bonk, Jamie never has eyes for anyone else, and he likes it when she puts on a bit of weight because it goes straight to her lovely round arse. The perfect man indeed. After hundreds of hours of listening, Gabaldon's writing is pretty predictable. She never passes up the chance to use a well-worn phrase, endlessly describes what Jamie's hair looks like, and loves to go off on a tangent about 18th century science or doctoring. Narrator Davina Porter never flags, although I have known her to mix up an accent here and there. And you know what? I'll miss these books when I'm done. They may be rambling and way too long but they're fun to listen to.

To read my reviews of previous books, click on pic: . . . . The first book had me completely absorbed in the little details and fascinating plot, the second book made me angry by the huge jump in time and then made me happy, while the third book continued to hold my interest. The fourth book was a little slow. The fifth book made me wish for all that time spent listening back again because really, however many pages an author should devote to homesteading, Ms. Gabaldon surpassed it at least ten-fold.

The fourth book was a little slow. The fifth book made me wish for all that time spent listening back again because really, however many pages an author should devote to homesteading, Ms. Gabaldon surpassed it at least ten-fold. The sixth book frustrated me with its plodding story, with its hyper-attention to detail, and with the continued and inexplicable use of multiple narrators. This does nothing but prolong the agony. If the last two books have been less-than-ideal and even somewhat of a waste of time, why did I continue the series and move on to <+++>A Breath of Snow and Ashes</+++>? I wish I knew. The writing sucks. It is not a well-written series at all, repetitive and worthy of many an eye roll or snort of disbelief. Ms. Gabaldon uses the same phrases, descriptions, and dialogue all the time. While continuity is important, the repetition becomes old very quickly. This is on top of the fact that the entire series is just one big, very bad soap opera \u2013 the kind where the villain suffers forty different ways to die but always survives to torment his victims. Stephen Bonnet is the eighteenth-century Stefano. One can practically predict which major character is slated for his or her turn at mortal peril because it happens to them all with such frequency. Yet, I keep listening, yelling at the characters for their stupidity and getting anxious on their behalf even though I know they all survive for at least two more books. I was sucked into the Outlander world, and I can\u2019t seem to get out. In the beginning of the series, the sex scenes were so unusual in a romance novel because they were actually vital to the story. Through their most intimate moments, readers learned more about Clare and Jamie, their vulnerabilities and their sensitivities. It was never a sex scene purely for titillation but a method by which the characters developed and grew. The same can no longer be said about any of the sex scenes within these later novels. First of all, there is nothing more to learn about Jamie or Clare. Readers have been with them for years now, and their characters are fairly set in their development. Then, there is the ick factor. Both are approaching 60 years of age, and while I appreciate that their love life is healthy and frequent, it is not necessarily something about which I want to read. Jamie\u2019s comments about Clare\u2019s body have him turning into a lecherous old man, and that is just wrong. Then there is the physical descriptions themselves. While Jamie is clearly an ass man given his many lascivious (and slightly disturbing) comments about the state of Clare\u2019s derri\u00e8re, I\u2019m beginning to think Ms. Gabaldon is a breast woman herself. There is way too much attention and description devoted to all females\u2019 breasts. Dresses cling to them, sweat trickles between them, they are fondled, kissed, and cupped, they leak milk, and babies release them with audible noises. If there is a woman in any given scene, Ms. Gabaldon will inevitably mention something about that woman\u2019s breasts. Frankly, it\u2019s annoying and disappointing. Then there is the issue with Jamie and Clare\u2019s daughter and son-in-law. I hate Bree and Roger. There. I said it. Bree is one of the most spoiled, stupid girls in print. Roger was great, if a bit weak and unmanly in comparison to Jamie, until he married Bree. With that one act, he became thoroughly uninteresting and superlative. As for Bree, she is just now thinking of the dangers of going back in time 200 years to the Revolutionary War \u2013 after the war has started. For someone who is supposed to have such a brilliant mind, she completely lacks in common sense as well as empathy. The scenes told from either of their points of view are just agonizing, as Roger spends most of his time thinking about Bree and Bree spends most of her time worrying about how certain events are going to affect her. Their sex scenes are not in the least bit erotic or even very romantic. Very rarely do they contribute something to the overarching plot, and most of the time, their presence causes more complications than solutions. It goes without saying that their removal from the story would also eliminate a good number of pages in this very bloated series. The problem is that at an average audiobook length of 50+ hours, I have spent way too much time devoted to Jamie and Clare to quit the series now. I may not be quite as vested in their survival as I once was, but I would like to solve the mystery of how they die. I would like closure. Ms. Gabaldon has not yet written her stories to provide closure, and so I am stuck in this world of time travelers. I will continue with the series onto book 7 and eventually book 8 when it is released next year. Perhaps by then, Ms. Gabaldon will have made it possible for me to say good-bye. Until then, there will be more yelling and eye-rolling and general frustration at the slow pacing, repetitive syntax, unnecessary narrative shifts, and completely unnecessary sex scenes. It is most definitely the book world\u2019s version of a daytime soap opera. ...more This book covers the adventures of the extended Fraser-McKenzie clan through the years 1772-1776, and oh God, you feel every one of them.

I picked up this book in late August 2015. I just finished it last week. For those of you as bad at math as I am, that is NINE MONTHS. I coulda grown a whole baby in the time it took me to read this book. If I was a cat, maybe dozens of babies. A rabbit . . . at least a hundred. (If I was an elephant I would still be pregnant.) According to Goodreads, it took me eighteen days to read Outlander , four days to read Dragonfly in Amber (Sidenote: Holy shit! how did I do that?), eleven days to read Voyager , seven days to read Drums of Autumn , and only nine days to read what felt like the interminably long The Fiery Cross . And really, I was on track to finish this one in a reasonable (for this series) amount of time. I read the first 54% in six days. And then I put it down and just . . . never picked it back up again. That was on September 2nd. I made a token effort on December 7th; read about six pages. Then put it back down again and didn\u2019t pick it back up again until March 1st. That\u2019s not good! I shouldn\u2019t have been able to do that. I should have been clamoring to see what happened next. I wasn\u2019t. Nothing felt urgent at all. And I will admit, this book is SO much better than the previous one. Actual thematic relevance across storylines. Things moving forward (albeit glacially). And even though I have some problems with the repeated cycle of violence against these characters, at least here while I was reading, it was always interesting. (Not so in Fiery Cross .) The problem is there\u2019s just TOO MUCH OF IT. In case you were wondering whether it is possible to in fact have too much of a good thing, this book is proof that you can. 1,439 pages. ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE PAGES. I know that part of the appeal of these books is that they are long, and I like long books! The length of the series itself, and the length of each individual book, really allow you to spend time with these characters and sink yourself into their world. But this one (and the last one) just go too far. 1,000-1,100 pages would have been okay and doable. Easily 400 pages of this monster could have been cut. Sure we would have lost some cute scenes, but were they really necessary ? Especially when the alternative is that your book is so bloated it loses track of its own plot. And really, couldn\u2019t we also have cut out entirely that plot with Claire getting kidnapped (and (view spoiler) [raped (hide spoiler) ] )? Was that necessary? Especially since she\u2019s put into peril at the end of the book as well. And yet again we have Brianna being rescued from Stephen Bonnet in an extended sequence that we\u2019ve already seen before. At least this time he\u2019s gone for good. (But again, I was so ready for him to be gone, I couldn\u2019t even fully appreciate how good that scene was at the end between him and Brianna.) It\u2019s like that how you sometimes say you\u2019re using belt and suspenders to indicate that you\u2019re maybe doing something not necessary. Gabaldon is a belt and suspenders writer. She doesn\u2019t just use one, she uses both, and then on top of that she also sows her pants to her shirt JUST IN CASE. And maybe also brings along an extra pair of pants in her purse. At least most of the scenes in this one weren\u2019t mind-numbing as well as repetitive and somewhat unnecessary. I\u2019d rather read about Lizzie accidentally getting knocked up by the Beardsley twins and then marrying both of them, that tiny little bigamist, than read about ghost bears, Brianna's engorged breasts, and the state of Jemmy\u2019s diapers. But really, I think the main problem here is that Gabaldon was trying to bridge the years in between Brianna finding her family and marrying Roger at the end of Drums of Autumn , and the coming American Revolution, and it took her two books to do it when she should have done it in one. Nothing interesting happens politically in that time that couldn\u2019t have been covered in one book. For two books it\u2019s been: THE REVOLUTION IS COMING THINGS ARE HAPPENING. But nothing *actually* happens until the end of this book. All the books have had backbones except these two. Outlander had Jamie and Claire meeting in 1740s Scotland, and Claire\u2019s journey to decide to stay in the past. Dragonfly had them trying to stop the Rising in France and learning to be a married couple. Voyager was them finding their way back to each other after so long apart, and Brianna learning the truth and coming to terms with her family\u2019s past. And Drums of Autumn had all those threads coming together, so that they\u2019re finally all settled together on Fraser\u2019s Ridge in North Carolina. Fiery Cross and A Breath of Snow and Ashes was basically, \u201cHey the Revolution is coming! No, really it is! We promise! Just bear with me a sec!\u201d \"Oh, and also, life in these times was dangerous and men will rape you.\" And meanwhile, all the characters were mostly stuck in one place for two VERY long books (more if you count all the time on Fraser's Ridge in Drums of Autumn ). It was claustrophobic, and she would have done better skipping those years or fast forwarding through them, I think, rather than wading through them. Domestic bliss is nice for the characters, not so nice for readers. And neither is manufactured drama (which after a while, all that repetitive peril starts to feel like). Anyway, I\u2019ve heard the next two books are pretty good, and the Revolution HAS started. There are emotional conflicts involved for all the Frasers, now that Jamie\u2019s son is on the other side, and the McKenzies are back in the future. It might be a while before I actually dive in, though. I\u2019m not a masochist. ...more This book is only for people who enjoy the characters and the America they inhabit.

So much happens in this book. As much as I liked the story, it seemed to go on forever.

Well, not really, it's getting late, but, *sigh* I love this series and for all its faults it's a wonderful series about the love and loyalty and courage and power of family. ...more The mind boggles at just how much history Gabaldon has written into this novel. While the Outlander series may seem to some as an over-written tome for Jamie Fraser hysterics , the dearth of American history enfolded is quite amazing. I have much admiration for the author.

But from his wife Jamie knows that three years hence the shot heard round the world will be fired, and the result will be independence \u2014 with those loyal to the King either dead or in exile. And there is also the matter of a tiny clipping from The Wilmington Gazette, dated 1776, which reports Jamie\u2019s death, along with his kin. For once, he hopes, his time-traveling family may be wrong about the future. The only thing I can say is \"FANTASTIC.\" Happily, Gabaldon is saying there will be two more books to the series. This is one I wouldn't mind seeing go on, and on, and on..... ...more j ai ador\u00e9 ce volume... et je suis tellement triste de le finir. j ai essay\u00e9 de le distiller le plus longtemps possible ^^ j ai hate que le 7 sorte !!! il faut attendre le mois de mai :D I clearly was not in top form when I read this book and that's probably the only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5.

Anyway, only after I was DONE with the \"ashes\" book did I realize I had just SKIPPED from BOOK ONE to BOOK SIX!!!!!!!! I was so angry because I KNOW for a FACT that I would have LOVED book two but now I figure why bother because I know how it all turns out. ACK! I feel cheated by my own stupidity ... don't make my mistake. Read them in this order (but check me because as you can see, I already messed up once): 1. Outlander - FANTASTIC! 2. Dragonfly In Amber 3. Voyager 4. Drums in Autumn 5. The Fiery Cross 6. Breath of Snow and Ashes Grrr. Almost wish I hadn't just written this review. I haven't thought about this DUMB move in months. ...more To quote a dear friend of mine, Diana is back on track with this one! The 6th in the Outlander series started off a bit slow for me, but I was able to get sucked in once again. There is lots of romance and lots of drama on Fraser's Ridge as Jamie, Claire, family, and friends prepare themselves for the upcoming Revolutionary War. And damn Diana for making me like Brianna after me being so annoyed with her in Fiery Cross. I am impressed when writers can turn your opinion around regarding characters. \"But-oh God! Did she tell ye how it happened?\" -Jamie Fraser \"Yes. I'll tell you the gory details later.\" -Claire Fraser That little snippet of dialogue pretty much sums up this entire book. IT WAS FREAKING AWESOME! I admit that I really was starting to lose interest in this series after The Fiery Cross because it was just so boring, but this one really made up for it in SPADES. Oh, the drama! The scandal! The gossip! The sex scenes were better! The dialogue and jokes were better! At times, I felt \"But-oh God! Did she tell ye how it happened?\" -Jamie Fraser \"Yes. I'll tell you the gory details later.\" -Claire Fraser That little snippet of dialogue pretty much sums up this entire book. IT WAS FREAKING AWESOME! I admit that I really was starting to lose interest in this series after The Fiery Cross because it was just so boring, but this one really made up for it in SPADES. Oh, the drama! The scandal! The gossip! The sex scenes were better! The dialogue and jokes were better! At times, I felt like I was watching a Saturday Night Live sketch. At other times, I teared up at how touching the interaction of the Fraser/MacKenzie family is and how much they stuck together. And there was a lot of action scenes...and a lot of the story was told from the differing POVs of Claire, Jamie, Bree and Roger. It wasn't JUST The Diary of Claire Fraser...today, I planted lettuce, tomorrow I will clean my surgery, etc. It was really great and there are so many things that you never see coming. So many times in this book I was like, OMG did that just happen!? And it was REALLY cool to read the beginning of the Revolutionary War from the perspective of people who had only read about it in history books. I don't know. This one is my favorite after Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber , no question. I haven't been so wrapped up and engrossed in the world of Jamie and Claire since I read Voyager . And I am shocked because I had heard that book 6 was really really long and slow and boring, but damn if I didn't tear through it in less than four days. I couldn't even put it down for a break! Written so well...humorous and touching dialogue...have I mentioned the drama? It was like watching the Jerry Springer show in Diana Gabaldon's words set against the Revolutionary War time in North Carolina. I cried...oh, I cried! And I laughed so hard at times. Just look at my tags on this book and you can see how poor Jamie would be so scandalized by what was happening on his Ridge! I. Loved. It. If you are iffy about continuing on with the series after the slow pace of Drums of Autumn and The Fiery Cross , just do what I did...chalk up The Fiery Cross to this: (view spoiler) [Claire and Jamie obviously were on a downcycle, Brianna couldn't think about anything without letting down her milk, and well, if I were almost hanged, I'd probably be in a pissy mood like Roger was too. No wonder no one was having any sex or any fun or making any jokes. (hide spoiler) ] Then just regard The Fiery Cross as necessary research and background reading for the rest of the series. I do have to say that (view spoiler) [the Back To The Future moment at the end was an especially cool touch...really liked that one! (hide spoiler) ] Well done, Mrs. Gabaldon...WELL DONE! I will be starting An Echo in the Bone tomorrow and then I'll be able to finally be in the boat with all of the other Outlander fans breathlessly awaiting the release of the eighth book.

But, happily for me, back on par with Outlander and Voyager! After really loving the series through #3, the 4th and 5th books were somewhat disappointing for me.

But this time Jamie have the chance to not only follow ideals but also stick in the winning side, not only for his family but for all the families depending on him. But they can feel the powder and the violence in the air and dangers and perils are headed their way. Jamie and Claire A lot happens with Claire in this one,quite a LOT. At the beginning of the book I was quite angry/upset with her, regarding her attitude towards Lord John. She implied something monstrous and despicable about him, and I do get it she said it out if jealousy...I do believe she didn't even believe her own words. But still, that situation pained me not only because of John but also because of her, I know she is better than that, it's no wonder she is one of my favorite characters ever, So yeah, I didn't stay mad for long. Even more because of that she goes through some despicable things that I kept wishing it wouldn't happened, and hoping a certain someone would get to her in time. But one thing we know for certain, together this 2 can go through EVERYTHING...they are strong individuals but together they are a force to reckon with. I love how they understand each other and how they can't even imagine a world without the other. I said it several times but Claire and Jaime are just amazing...I LOVE THEM TO PIECES! Roger and Brianna \u201cAll I want\u201d, she said softly to the dark,\"is for you to love me. Not because of what I can do or what I look like, or because I love you - just because I am.\u201d \"Perfect, unconditional love?\" he said just as softly.\"Some would tell ye only God can love that way - but I can try\" Roger Mac and Bree, another beloved couple.And do they go in an emotional roller coaster? YES! From Roger finding is calling or I must say, his purpose, to Bree get caught up with some despicable persons....with everything that will lead them to a path where they have to risk everything so save a love one. Other characters The award for most surprising storyline, goes to.... Lizzie! I think mainly because I didn't expect it at all! It's true what they say of the shy ones. Malva, Malva. What to say about her? She was Claire's apprentice, eager to learn, eager to be free of the restraints of her circumstances. Many times I didn't knew what make of her and then all hell went lose. I couldn't believe the things she said and how people believed her. Now do I think she deserved what she got? Not at all but at least in the end we find out the betrayal wasn't what it seemed. Ian...we get to know a lot more about his time with the Mohawks and it's just breaks my heart. I just wish him to find some happiness and inner peace. Jemmy and Germain are ADORABLE! I love this 2 cutie pies. And Jemmy is so precious, he is the protagonist of one of the sweetest scenes ever, that actually made me cry! (view spoiler) [ When he sees his grandad back and ends u kissing his shoulder, to make it better...my precious lad T.T (hide spoiler) ] And Fergus? I don't know why but half of the time I still keep picturing the wee lad from Paris...and it pained me the inner struggle he was going trough,especially when he feels we could not protected and support his family. And I did understood his reaction to his new born baby but thankfully he saw above it and finally found a path to be happy and to prosper with his family. And last but not least...Lord John, you're amazing! :D Overall It's getting harder and harder to write reviews for this series...how can I convey my love for it, this page turner, time consuming, emotional roller coaster, an epic love story,without repeating it over and over? Well, I can't.... So you must bare with me :-) This book, like the others is massive.... I mean, nearly 1450 pages, full of stories, character's developments, twists and turns. But above else, we as readers have the unique opportunity of reading about their lives, triumphs and misfortunes....choices and fates, happiness and sadness.

I think I spent the majority of my reading time with my heart in my throat, worried about what would happen next. There were less \"new\" characters in this one, which I enjoyed a lot because I sometimes have a hard time learning all the new people and keeping them straight. Yes there were new ones, but unlike The Fiery Cross book 5, it didn't feel like they were pounded in. A few jaw dropping moments for me. I am hiding them inside spoilers so if you haven't read, don't click. (view spoiler) [Claire being kidnapped, beaten and raped while she was at the whiskey shed with Marsali. I honestly was so scared for her, I had no doubt that Jamie was going to come and save her, but I felt her doubt for those few moments when the men were on top of her that she wasn't sure she was going to make it.

I was SO excited. I felt like Roger loved Jem as his own, but he really needed a baby he was sure was his I felt.
