Throughout Operating Instructions, one finds scatterings of an understanding that there\u2019s something not quite consistent about preaching love, mercy, and non-judgmentalism while simultaneously ripping apart Republicans as a group, actively training one\u2019s child to revile them, and comparing them to the greatest of evils. She actually gets that there\u2019s something not quite right about running on hatred. But she doesn\u2019t know how to let it go, either, because, in some ways, it defines her. This, I suppose is a reflection of her larger Christian journey \u2013 and perhaps the journey of nearly all Christians: seeing the new man at last, but still struggling to shed the old one. Although Lamott does not seem to feel that there\u2019s something not quite right about sleeping around casually and having numerous abortions, this time she does feel that there\u2019s something not quite right about aborting this particular child \u2013 she wants it, even though the father doesn\u2019t, even though she\u2019ll have to face the difficult challenge of raising it alone. (Not that she\u2019s really alone; she has amazing friends and family, a loving church, and, of course, her faith.) So she has Sam, and she writes a journal of his first year, or, more accurately, a journal of her first year as a mother \u2013 a raw, honest journal that reveals feelings most mothers would be loathe to confess. There are moments of great beauty in this journal \u2013 wonderful turns of phrase, graspings of the magnificence of mercy, glimpses into Christ reflected in the love and compassion of everyday people. The book is an easy read, because she writes well. I just wish I could like the author more. She describes herself well \u2013 an egomaniac with a low self-image problem. But maybe that, in the end, is what makes the book so interesting \u2013 it\u2019s human-ness, it\u2019s bold honesty, it\u2019s revelation of the flawed and fallen yet \u2013 ultimately \u2013 redeemed human being, the mother struggling to make it through her first year. The book has passages that are achingly beautiful, as well as passages that are achingly pretentious. Some sentences caused me to laugh, others caused me to cry, and still others caused me to roll my eyes. Lamott employs so many impressive analogies for faith, stories and descriptions that demonstrate the tentativeness, the tenderness, the necessity, the beauty, the not-quite-sufficient sufficiency, the depth, and the difficulty of faith \u2013 how faith is like waiting, expectantly, half-hopefully, for our next operating instructions from God. ...more I teach at Creighton University, and so (like most instructors) was appalled when Lamott was \"disinvited,\" but never more than after I read this book. It's been a long time since I've laughed out loud while reading a book, and longer since a book has provoked guffaws (seriously, hearty laughter) AND reflection, revelation, and grief. \"Honest\" is a perfect word to describe this book, which bravely (I think) puts out there the concept that being a mother isn't always being 100% in love with your c I teach at Creighton University, and so (like most instructors) was appalled when Lamott was \"disinvited,\" but never more than after I read this book. It's been a long time since I've laughed out loud while reading a book, and longer since a book has provoked guffaws (seriously, hearty laughter) AND reflection, revelation, and grief. \"Honest\" is a perfect word to describe this book, which bravely (I think) puts out there the concept that being a mother isn't always being 100% in love with your child, that it isn't always the most wildly blissful experience, that sometimes mothers do wish they could make their babies disappear. And yet, there is such tenderness in the way she begs repeatedly of God to let her son outlive her (using an image that's always killed me: baby turtles just born, struggling across the beach to the water, picked off one by one by circling birds). This is a woman who runs straight at the truth in her prose, and as a reader I often felt the impact resonate through me. I'm not a mother, and I don't know about the whole God thing, but wow, did this book arrest my movement through life and give me some things to think about. ...more This is the best parenting book ever!

Anne Lamott writes all the gritty details of the thoughts that go through any sleep deprived parent's mind, but we aren't ever brave enough to admit them, sometimes not even to ourselves. Having already read about some crazy lady (Anne Lamott) wondering if she could leave her baby out in the cold and see if that whole \"survival of the fittest\" thing would work out, I was far more forgiving when I hadn't slept in weeks and found myself daydreaming about similar psychotic scenarios. Sleep deprivation is a real bitch, and a screaming baby that depends on you for life can be a real cheese grater on your nerves. Knowing there are other parents that think those crazy thoughts and don't actually DO them can make a world of difference in the way new parents handle the stress of it all. The birth of your child is also the death of the life you once knew. It may be similar, but it will never be the same. Anne Lamott graciously shows us we don't have to be graceful about it, we can go through it kicking and screaming, too. Her honesty is a blessing to us all. ...<---F>more Hold your hats, folks</---F>. I\u2019m about to get all \u201cover-the-top\u201d in this review. I needed this book right now, with all it\u2019s one-lines that make me laugh out loud. You should have seen me last evening, lying in the grass outside my church (it was only in the 70s yesterday, and today, with a light breeze - perfect grass lying weather) and laughing like a maniac. I\u2019m sure all the Amish people who came by in their buggies must have thought I was nuts. So this book is the journal that Lamott kept during her Hold your hats, folks.

You should have seen me last evening, lying in the grass outside my church (it was only in the 70s yesterday, and today, with a light breeze - perfect grass lying weather) and laughing like a maniac. I\u2019m sure all the Amish people who came by in their buggies must have thought I was nuts. So this book is the journal that Lamott kept during her son\u2019s first year of life. It\u2019s a story of love and fear - all that stuff that comes with a kid, I assume - and is so honest, so so honest. And funny, really funny. Take this, for example: November 22 - I wish he could take longer naps in the afternoon. He falls asleep and I feel I could die of love when I watch him, and I think to myself that he is what angels look like. Then I doze off, too, and it\u2019s like heaven, but sometimes only twenty minutes later he wakes up and begins to make his gritchy rodent noises, scanning the room wildly. I look blearily over at him in the bassinet, and think, with great hostility, Oh, God, he\u2019s raising his loathsome reptilian head again. When I go over to the bassinet to pick him up, though, he looks up at me like I\u2019m Coco the clown - he beams, and makes raspberries, and does frantic bicycle kicks like he\u2019s doing his baby aerobics. Then I feel I can go on. I\u2019ve never been so up and down in my life, so erratic and wild. My body is slow getting back to normal, except for my butt and thighs. I have to keep remembering the line about the little earth suits and that I am a feminist, because the thighs are just not doing all that well. I lay in the bathtub yesterday looking at them, thinking of entering the annual Hemingway write-alike contest with a piece called, \u201cThighs like White Elephants.\u201d And then part of me thinks, Hey, who fucking cares. That voice, that sarcastic, bitter but ultimately beautiful voice is what I love about Anne Lamott. I\u2019m going to give this book to every friend of mine who has a kid - which is most of them - so that they don\u2019t feel so alone when they think their baby has a reptilian head. And I\u2019m going to remember this book when I hold their babies and wonder what goes on in those little brains. The only sad part about having finished this book is that now I\u2019m out of Lamott books to read. Annie, get writing would ya? ...more This is not an empowering book.

Lamott describes herself as being in a dark hole most of that first year, unwashed, depressed, extremely tired and lonely, with rare glimpses of her son's beauty. I think a lot of her issues stem from the self-acknowledged substance abuse problems of the past and losing her father some years earlier though, not from having a baby on her own. All in all, I would much rather read a positive, upbeat book written by somebody who is capable of maintaining self-discipline and organizing their lives than an author who aims at being brutally honest but really sounds like another common wreck of a person. ...more Oh how I wish I had read this book when my children were babies! Then perhaps I would have realized I was not alone in finding new motherhood so hard while loving my children so unbearably much. Annie Lamott just nails it. Even if you have never been a parent, your kids have grown up, read this for the sheer pleasure of it. This is a great, lovely book about having a newborn. I had a blast reading it because I don\u2019t have a newborn anymore (a three & a half-year-old is a whole other flavor of getting your ass kicked) & it\u2019s easy to have fond feelings about G's babyhood that are based on totally false recollections. \"Remember when we could just set him on the couch & he couldn't go anywhere? Remember when he took two whole naps a day? Ah, such good times.\" I am an idiot. I was so constantly exhausted that This is a great, lovely book about having a newborn.

I was so constantly exhausted that my skeleton hurt, and while you could set G on the couch & he couldn\u2019t go anywhere, he\u2019d just start crying hysterically, so it wasn\u2019t actually that cool. Lamott gazes at her napping son, thinking sweetly how angelic he is; she falls asleep, he wakes her up a few minutes later, and she thinks, \u201cOh great, he\u2019s raising his monstrous lizard head again.\u201d Yeah, I know that feeling. Every ludicrous fear she has that she\u2019s broken Sam\u2019s neck because she hit a pothole in the car, all her amazement at his star-like little hands, his gigantic round eyes, and his porno-baby puffy lips, every time she\u2019s been listening to him cry for hours & she wants to give him back \u2013 every bit of this is totally spot-on. It\u2019s so accurate to my own life that when she comments about how Sam can now say more than \u201cAh-goo\u201d I laughed out loud. Ah-goo is the name of G\u2019s stuffed monkey because it was the first animal he ever noticed & it was also the first thing he could say. This is such a wonderful book & I am absolutely never having another baby. ...more a few things were laugh-outloud-funny, a lot of things were kind of ridiculous. Having a new little dude ourselves, certainly there were moments and events I could relate to, but the self-absorbed self-deprecating thing got really tiresome for me. Also, yes, I get it, you belong to a predominately black church; move on. My friend Michelle lent me this book after we were talking about feminist books about motherhood. I haven\u2019t read anything by Lamott before, but after reading this one I definitely want to read more of her books, both fiction and nonfiction. She has a book about writing called Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life that sounds interesting; I might look it up.

I haven\u2019t read anything by Lamott before, but after reading this one I definitely want to read more of her books, both fiction and nonfiction. She has a book about writing called Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life that sounds interesting; I might look it up. Operating Instructions is presented in the form of a journal, excerpted from the personal journal she kept during her first year of motherhood. From the beginning I am impressed by Lamott\u2019s ability to openly discuss her fears about bringing a child into the world. She makes this serious subject humorous, saying that more than anything she fears the knowledge that her child will have to go through the seventh and eighth grades. But she becomes serious again, asking, \u201cSo how on earth can I bring a child into the world, knowing that such sorrow lies ahead, that it is such a large part of what it means to be human?\u201d (11). This question seems to reverberate throughout the book, as she examines the painful aspects of her own life along with the joys. She balances her overwhelming love and faith with an honest, raw portrayal of the trials of single motherhood. More than anything else I am drawn in by her honesty--well, what I assume is honesty. It seems that if someone offers stories of pain, addiction and darkness and laces her stories with self-deprecating humor, she must be honest. Who knows, really. But I think: How could this not be honest. Her words are so deeply felt, so violently real. I believe Lamott\u2019s story, perhaps too much. I believe that a story of motherhood without this total insanity--incredible pain, despair, agony--would be false. Maybe I\u2019m too cynical. But I can easily believe that if I were in her circumstances, raising a newborn baby by myself while trying to support us, I would probably fall into a dark pit of despair and not come out. The challenges of raising a child seem to me to be insurmountable. Not sleeping for months, crying and bleeding, being covered in milk, shit, tears, and vomit, dealing with screaming and crying for hours on end, losing one\u2019s mind... I don\u2019t know if I could survive. Suddenly I look around at all the people I know who have children. How did they do it? Bringing a child into the world and raising it has got to be the most courageous act of heroism I can imagine. Ordinary people seem to have accomplished the impossible--raising children without going insane or killing someone. Either it\u2019s not as hard as I imagine, or all these people are heroes. What Anne Lamott has that I lack is faith in God. This is a beautiful part of her narrative, as lovely and sustaining as her boundless love for her child and the unshakable support of friends, family, and community. Lamott finds strength and love in God and this gets her through some of her darkest moments. The way she portrays her community of friends is holy. They save her with their presence, their gifts of food and love, helping her around the house, taking the baby for a while. Just being with her, sharing the moments with Sam, as if that is the most important thing in the world to be doing. Lamott\u2019s journal is filled with beauty, and heartwrenching love. The awesome mother-love that she feels; realizing that now there is something in her life that she cares about so much, it could destroy her. She says, \u201cI feel that he has completely ruined my life, because I just didn\u2019t used to care all that much\u201d (61). Somehow, Lamott vividly portrays this overwhelming, complex feeling of love, pain, hope, fear, and awe without idealizing motherhood or her baby. She doesn\u2019t hide her darker feelings of anger, frustration, pain, hopelessness, and fear, but lets them into the story as part of the full experience of being a mother. The serious, precious moments of insight are interspersed with funny stories about the baby\u2019s turds or weird animal behaviors. Throughout the journal Lamott throws in humorous interludes, memories of past events, stories about friends and family, and political commentary. The journal is many-layered. It is not just the story of Lamott and her son, but of her family history, her close friendships, her personal difficulties, her career as a writer, and so on. As I neared the end of the book, I wanted it to go on. I wanted to know the people better, to watch Sam as he grew, to hear him start talking and see him go to school. The more personal narratives I read the more I can believe that people\u2019s lives really are very interesting when told in an insightful, powerful way. Life must be inherently interesting, all the challenges and hurdles, funny little foibles, big achievements that are perhaps silly but worth celebrating. Like a baby\u2019s first smile. ...more This was an Anne Lamott book that I had skipped for years and years, figuring I wouldn't appreciate it until I was a mom. Well, I'm glad I waited. I definitely wouldn't have appreciated it as much if I hadn't been able to connect with the motherhood thing. As much as I loved this book, I feel like it was written for a person like me: a liberal, slightly neurotic, spiritual mom. If you're not all four of these things, you might end up hating this book a little bit, or maybe even a lot. One thing I This was an Anne Lamott book that I had skipped for years and years, figuring I wouldn't appreciate it until I was a mom. Well, I'm glad I waited.

As much as I loved this book, I feel like it was written for a person like me: a liberal, slightly neurotic, spiritual mom. If you're not all four of these things, you might end up hating this book a little bit, or maybe even a lot. One thing I really liked about it was how this book was a peek inside Anne Lamott's writing process. Its subtitle is \"A Journal of My Son's First Year,\" and it truly seems to be a journal that Anne keeps as a writer. She reflects on her craft quite a bit in addition to reflecting on motherhood, and having her practice modeled like this was almost as valuable as Bird by Bird . I found that the act of writing about a baby makes you reflect on what it is to be human, and if it's your own baby, it makes you reflect on what you want for your child and what this means about you as a person. Lamott writes, \"I guess he'll have to figure out someday that he is supposed to have this dark side, that it is part of what it means to be human, to have the darkness just as much as the light--that in fact the dark parts make the light visible; without them the light would disappear. But I guess he has to figure other stuff out first, like how to keep his neck from flopping all over the place and how to sit up.\" The book is filled with moments that the hospital kept warning me were signs of postpartum depression. I myself had a significant amount of postpartum anxiety, such as bursting into tears at the thought of bringing my five-day-old son to the doctor when it was about 2 degrees outside, but Anne's daily journal helped me see what it must be like to have the full-blown depression. It sounds really awful, and I think that this book could really help a mom who's experiencing it understand what's happening to her. As I generally find with Lamott's writing, there were parts that made me laugh out loud (inviting stares from my fellow public transit riders), parts that made me tear up, and lots and lots of parts that made me stop reading just to reflect for a bit on what she had said. Her anxieties about her son sounded so familiar, like the way she would start obsessing about what she would do if her son grew up to be a Republican, but how she mostly just prays and prays that he outlives her. This book made me a little jealous of Lamott, as she has a job that allowed her to stay home with her baby. This would cut me sometimes on my way to or may way home from work, because it's just so hard to leave my infant for twelve hours at a time, five days a week. Her journal made me wish that I could be an established writer who could stay home with her baby and write and write and write. ...more Just finished this one this morning. This was the kind of book that I resisted because everyone else kept telling me to read it. Also, because I'm writing a lot, I was afraid I'd start writing like Lamott and BINGO! I am. Anyhow, that said, I'm glad I've read it. The end is very sad, sadder because it is true.

Reading it also fulfilled that promise that you'll think about your own new motherhood and think: \"At least I'm not Anne Lamott.\" I was going to give the book three stars instead of four because I felt like her drug and alcohol addiction overpowered the rest of the text until I realized two things: 1.) the other night during a mental breakdown the only person I had any desire to talk to was Anne Lamott (like we're friends, you know.) 2.) the ending was so powerful, she deserves some kudos for that Oh, and one more thing, twice I laughed so hard while book n' boobing that Silas thought I was crazy!!! Okay, that's it. ...more I should have reviewed this when I quit the book but instead I waited so long so I may forget some of what I wanted to say. I do remember this though, Lamott borderline disgusts me. If she bothered me just a smidgen more I'd be thoroughly disgusted with her person. When you pick up this book you tend to think it's about her son's first year of life right? You know, the whole \"Journal of My Son's First Year\" in the title and all. Well... no.

It's a hidden agenda for her political rants. And that pisses me off. If that's what she wanted to write about, alone or with snippets about her son and/or home life then fine, but give some warning. Her political and other ranting is a huge part of the book no matter how she tries to slide it in with readers none the wiser. The other big thing that pisses me off here is that she's not funny. Plain and simple./ I can laugh because of someone I don't like so it's not that. She just is not funny. I'm still clueless as to why she - or anyone else for that matter - thought she was important enough to write this. Who the hell is she? Granted, this can be said about a great many books today but that fact doesn't diminish it here. She's so not funny that she has to make jokes that the average person would roll their eyes out. Where these glowing reviews are coming from are beyond me. I think the majority of them are from people who agree with her political view (notice the singular use there if you will) and just want to buddy up. But I have a problem with that. If someone writes a book that I think sucks I'm not going to rate it highly and review it with glowing accolades because I may happen to agree with the author on some idea. And vice versa as well. I'm guessing not everyone feels the same though after reading some of the reviews and reading in between the lines. Oh, well. Oh, by the way, in case you didn't get it the first 200 times around, her son Sam is really fucking beautiful. My daughter is beautiful also but you don't see me publishing a book with over 100 pages of me saying \"Julia is so beautiful!\" Wtf. In ending I can't believe I let this hunk of shit sit in my house for so long. If no one orders it on PBS in a matter of days I'm really going to throw it in the trash. That way no one else falls victim to her stupid rants. ...more In Anne Lamott's OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS: A JOURNAL OF MY SON'S FIRST YEAR, you find phrases and sentences that give your false teeth some delicious, chewable morsels and poke a few neurons in your brain and jump-start the battery in your pacemaker.

Reading it, however, did not make me miss my adult children's childhoods. It did prompt me to add the I-Should-Have-Kept-a-More-Detailed-Record-of-Those-Days folder to my Regrets file. Those days were, in many ways, magical; and I believe, as Lamott mentions, that \"there really are places in the heart you don't know exist until you love a child\"(214). Yet when I think about those days, I don't find myself imitating Mary Hopkin singing \"Those Were the Days\" -- because, even without having kept a diary, I know that we didn't \"sing and dance forever and a day\" or \"live the life we choose\" or \"fight and never lose.\" No, THOSE days were not those days -- for me or for Lamott. Okay, perhaps some were. If you're trying to decide whether or not Lamott's journal-book is for you, focus on the subtitle, not the title. Lamott's work is not the set of \"operating instructions\" that no new parent gets. (Competing theories and unsolicited advice voiced by the well-intentioned and the heavily-invested- in-the-outcomes are not operating instructions.) So forget \"operating instructions\"; think EKGs. Lamott allows us to read hers. And whether or not you are -- or have been -- a parent, you don't need any special training to recognize and attach meanings to most of the ascending and descending lines, subtle irregularities, rapid changes, OMGs, and periods of stability. Parent? Not a parent? What's in those squiggly lines on the tape or monitor -- well -- you'll know that they're not JUST about the baby. ...more I've read most every book of Anne's now and without question I can say this one is my favorite.

Loved this line in particular: \u201cOne thing about having a baby is that each step of the way you simply cannot imagine loving him any more than you already do, because you are bursting with love, loving as much as you are humanly capable of- and then you do, you love him even more.\u201d ...more This book pretty much saved my life twenty years ago, when I had a difficult baby.

Reviewers swore up & down that even if I thought Anne Lamott was an ape-shit mother-in-law, I'd like her as a mom. So I gave her writing a second chance. I do not like her at all. In fact, I dislike her more than I did before reading this. In theory, I should like her. Like me, she is a female writer, a mother, a liberal, a Christian.

Every negative review I found for this book was someone complaining about her political & religious views. That was not my problem with this book. However, I found countless other things about it to be problematic. For example: 1. She's a closet racist. It was apparent in the book about her grandson, but even more in this one. She goes on and on about how some friend or acquaintance of hers is gay, or \"very black\" - whatever the hell that means. She clearly wants everyone to know how liberal & open-minded she thinks she is. But she never says anyone is her straight, Caucasian friend. I guess she thinks that goes without saying, and doesn't need pointed out. She talks TWICE about her hair being nappy, like black people's, and how she's so glad her son got white people hair. It made me very uncomfortable to read. Kind of like all her stereotypes about her Mexican daughter-in-law in Some Assembly Required. 2. Her comments about uncircumcised penises were absolutely disgusting. Especially the part where she makes a joke about how hard an uncut baby penis would be to clean - proving that she has no idea what the hell she's talking about, and also she's kind of a bitch. I found it creepy that she decides to get her son's genitals cut based on her own sexual preference. Unless she was planning on having incest with her son, I can't see how that's relevant. 3. She is SO whiny. She spent the entire book complaining about not having a partner to raise her son with, even though she knew that beforehand. The father made it very clear that he would not be in the picture. In fact, he wanted her to abort. She chose to raise the baby on her own. She wasn't blindsided, like moms who have their husbands abandon them & their children one day. She constantly talks about how it's so hard to be a single mom.. But she has a huge support system! She has countless friends, family & church members, as well as a babysitter. They do everything. Bring her food, do her laundry, clean her house, watch her kid, give her baby items. A lot of single welfare moms, or even married women, don't have that kind of help. Not to mention the fact that she has a career as a published author. Teen moms can't say that. 4. The way that she talked about her son truly repulsed me. She'd use vulgar language to describe him, say she hated him, and admit to fantasizing about physically abusing him. This is an innocent & helpless infant she was talking about. He didn't understand why he was in pain. He didn't have the ability to process those emotions, or do anything to make himself feel better. He didn't even have a way to communicate, except to cry. And she admits that his gas pains were caused by her diet while breastfeeding. I have no idea why she'd have so much anger towards her baby. Even on the worst days with my son, when he screams for hours & I'm completely alone, my husband deployed and no friends or family for thousands of miles, I don't feel nasty towards him. I just want to comfort him somehow. Then again, she is your typical privileged white woman. She's never had to think of anyone but herself her entire life, so a baby is an annoying inconvenience. He gets in the way of her \"me time\" & neurotic self-pitying uselessness. 5. I could not believe how immature she was. She was 35, not 15. She acted like a child, wanting God to wipe her ass for her. I guess that's why she used to be a coke head. Some people can't handle life, even if their life is relatively easy. 6. This entire book was one simile after another. Everything was like some show she saw or poem she read, or moonlight or stars. I'm not exaggerating. The only reason I finished this book was because I was mildly entertained by it. She's such a train wreck. This was the literary equivalent of trash TV. Like watching Jerry Springer. ...more I wanted to like this book more...I really did. I read Bird by Bird and thoroughly enjoyed it; smart, funny and insightful.

The book just feels bi-polar, for lack of a better description. It oscillates back and forth between two feelings / points-of-view, and the territories start to feel worn after about six months of Sam's life \u2022 A bit too much God for my taste...I really didn't want to hear about her religion \u2022 She tars men with a pretty broad brush, and while I can see many of our failings as a gender, it just got on my nerves a bit In the end, this felt a bit more like a book about Anne Lamott than it did about her son's first year, and that wasn't really what I was hoping for. My complaints have more, however, to do with a mismatch between my world-view and Lamott's, so YMMV. Despite mixed feelings, I gained some insights and perspective about my own first year as a parent, and in that sense, I'm glad I read it. She's a talented writer and a very keen observer of the world. ...more I picked this up at the used bookstore 2 days ago, having always heard about it. I'm not a parent and intend not to be one, but I read all sorts of memoirs about things I intend to not do, so I figured why not. And I'm thrilled I did, because I loved this book!

It was a very fast read. And for once I don't only mean that I whipped through the pages very quickly (3 hours). I mean it was fast-paced and I felt like I had to speed-read to keep up. It was an interesting feeling, being whipped through at the speed that I'm sure life felt like to Ms. Lamott. The pace of her pregnancy and her son's first year was echoed in the pace of her writing. She's alternatingly hilarious and sad. I laughed out loud every 20 pages or so. I was sad I was reading the book alone so I couldn't read bits of it out loud to someone. The trauma of dealing with unexpected and single parenthood makes her worry she's going to start drinking again (she's been sober for 3 years at this point). The naked honesty is refreshing, real, and relatable. Even someone like me who has only babysat understands the feeling of ricocheting between hatred and the purest love, when dealing with an infant. She worries about harming him, intentionally or unintentionally, she worries about his future, about money, about his lack of a father. But through it all, she has a ton of support, and her unerring sense of humor, and her faith. Throughout this book I was constantly thinking who can I pass this book on to? Because it's so fantastic, I want to share it with everyone. I thank Ms. Lamott for her openness and her truth. ...more I thought this book was alright. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but a new or about-to-be-new parent. I certainly don't think it's the best book Anne Lamott has ever written. I liked Bird by Bird and a couple of her novels a lot better than this. It's written as if it really were Lamott's journal, and maybe that's true. But I didn't like the structure because it jumped around between different subjects and moods too much. I only gave it two stars mostly because I was uncomfortable about the way I thought this book was alright. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but a new or about-to-be-new parent.

I only gave it two stars mostly because I was uncomfortable about the way in which Lamott wrote about race. It's like she goes out of her way to point out how many people in her life aren't white when it's not critical to the narrative. It feels like she is pointing this out to prove that she's really open-minded or something. Then she describes a lot of the people who attend her African-American church as \"really black\" or \"so black\" or \"very black\" which is just terribly racist. It's never totally made clear, but the degree of blackness of her church friends does not seem to be in reference to their skin color (which would be problematic in a different way); rather, it seems to be the main way she describes their mannerisms or speech patterns. What am I, the reader, supposed to do with that information? Fill in the blanks with stereotypes? Ugh, not helpful! I think it's fine that she tells us who is black and who is not, but she could have come up with a lot more adjectives to describe her church friends' personalities than \"really black.\" Her son Sam was born in 1989, but I don't think that the copyright date on this book is old enough to excuse the weird treatment of race. ...more Sometimes I really hate this site.

I love the viewpoint from a parent of a cholicy child (even if her child did start sleeping through the night fairly early - mine is 16 months and still not to that point.) I love her liberal, human take on faith. Hence why it lands in my favorite non fiction. So, why does it only receive three stars? Her absolutely barbaric, silly, uneducated take on men. As the primary caretaker of my child and a male, perhaps it hit me harder, but...... All men like staring at themselves erect in a mirror? All men make machine gun noises while they pee? All men are emotionally bereft and unable to be complete? Her claims are as sexist and ridiculous as those who sought to deny women equal rights. Is turnabout fair play or is it just showing your own brand of stupidity? In this case, it just comes across as a sad sort of revenge. Otherwise, I love this book and this author, but I will not close my eyes to bigotry even if it is reverse discrimination..... I can only hope that she raised her child above any gender war she so strongly feels a part of. ...more What's great about this book? The writing, the writing, the writing. Her fabulous humor, her honest portrayal of the first year of being a mother, her honesty about her baby not having a father, her grief at her friend's diagnosis, the way she hysterically talks about Republicans, the support so many give her, and especially her true deep belief in a loving God (though it completely contrasts with who she is) and watching her faith ebb and flow.

I would have liked it more if I had just had a baby or especially if I had just had my first. I guess so many other sides of her life sounded so interesting, I wanted more than just a baby journal. I was actually kind of glad to see her son's first birthday come. That being said, she's an AMAZING writer (funny, witty, honest, and genius) and I'd like to read other things she's written (anyone have suggestions?)If you just had your first baby, I think you'd adore this. Overall, about a 3.5. ...more My lust for books that are about motherhood has led me to \"<+++>Operating Instructions: A Journal of My Son's First Year</+++>\" by Anne Lamott.

She deliciously describes how wonderful and painful motherhood can be. You want to cheer her on, call her to offer advice, and wallow in her self pity. Clearly a skillful writer, Anne manages to develop the characters from her personal life as well as a plot within her journal. Although I shudder at many of her conventional parenting decisions, I still really enjoyed sharing the experience with her. I don't recommend looking to this book for parenting advice but rather when you are in misery and looking for company and comfort as you struggle through your own parenting hurdles. ...more After stopping reading because I'd started when I first got pregnant and stopped when I had my first miscarriage (who needs someone exuding pure love and delight about their baby when you've just lost yours), I finally picked this up today almost two years later to decide about getting rid of it.

Lamott was writing this journal only for herself, which shows, because she just blurts it all out, the good, the bad and the horrific. This is about her friendships as well as her own little miracle baby, her faith in god and her doubt in herself. Sad and happy, I laughed and cried variously. Look out for the journal entry that leads to probably her most famous book, Bird by Bird. ...more I can see why some would consider this the original mommy blog.
