It's a mystery/adventure set in San Francisco, revolving around an out-of-work marketeer and web designer who takes a job as a clerk at the odd little bookshop of the title. He soon realises that there is more to Mr. Penumbra's than meets the eye, and together with a group of his friends, he embarks on a mission to get to the bottom of the shop's real purpose. What follows is a fantastical series of events involving an international secret society and almost impossibly complex codes hidden inside a series of books. It's a collision of ancient mystery and very modern, internet-savvy characters. It really sounded like something I would love, and it was in fact a really enjoyable little story. However, it's short - almost certainly far too short for all the ideas it tries to cram in - and at the end I realised it had been something of a letdown, for two main reasons. Firstly, I couldn't escape the nagging feeling that it was very familiar, that I'd almost read it before. It didn't take me long to realise that this was because the narrative voice reminded me so much of Ready Player One , a great adventure book which I read about a year ago. If it wasn't for the fact that Ready Player One is set in the future, I could easily have believed that this story was being told by a slightly older version of the same guy. Obviously the stories are very different, but their voices sound and feel very alike. Also, the plot is similar to Lev Grossman's Codex .<---F> Incredibly similar</---F>. Both have a kind-of-likeable, kind-of-annoying young male protagonist whose sidekicks are a computer-obsessed best friend and an unusually intelligent young woman (<---B>who's also the love interest</---B>), a central mystery involving a peculiar library and a centuries-old encoded book, and the use of modern technology and software to help solve a very old-fashioned conundrum. (There's even one scene, involving the main character visiting a warehouse full of museum objects to retrieve an important artefact, which I'm pretty sure is in both books, but I'd have to re-read Codex to know for definite, it's possible I'm confusing it with something else.) Secondly, I found it very juvenile. I'm only sure it must be intended for an adult market because all the characters are adults - I really felt the author's style and execution would be much better suited to an adventure for teens (more specifically, teenage boys). Weirdly, it felt more like YA to me than Ready Player One , which actually has teenage protagonists. It also had all the hallmarks of YA that normally stop me from enjoying it: lack of a properly detailed backstory; two-dimensional characters (the bad guy is a collection of clich\u00e9s and a damp squib all at once); way too many convenient details (Neel is a millionaire who can pay for everything the group needs, Kat can get them into Google and utilise all the company's resources for their task, etc). There's no real tension or peril: it's too obvious any obstacles are going to be overcome easily. I did genuinely like the fact that the power of new technology was so closely woven into a story about an arcane fellowship of book-lovers, and the progression of the story illustrated that there will always be a place for both 'old' and 'new'. But all those references to Google, Twitter, apps etc are going to sound very dated very soon, and the fact that the characters could solve practically anything by looking it up on the internet - while accurate and funny - diffused a lot of potential tension. I thought this was a likeable, quick and very easy read but I have to admit I'm a bit bemused by all the rave reviews it's been getting. It's a nice idea, but it's been done before and done better. Ready Player One is more involving and more fun, and there are countless versions of the secret-society-intrigue-and-mystery story that have more power, atmosphere and punch. ...more Meh - 1.5 stars because the plot was interesting enough that I finished the book and there were some funny moments.

Neel narrows his eyes.\" The entire narrative is just so damn obvious its annoying - here is what I see, here is what we are doing etc. Also, the book is a novel long ad for Google and Amazon. The narrator can't stop talking about \"Googlers\" and Kindles. I like my Kindle but not as its own character in my book. I can see that the author was trying to marry the old and the new - traditional books and new technology but he failed, really, really failed. I'd like my $12 back. ...more suuuuper fun! this book is going to sell like gangbusters when it comes out in october. mostly because each and every one of you reading this review are going out and getting yourselves a copy. this is a command. you like books,<---M> right? yes</---M>, you do, because you are a member of goodreads. and this book is about books! and puzzles! and adventure! there's not a whole lot that's better than that.it is shades of Salamander and The Grand Complication: A Novel and If on a Winter's Night a Traveler and T suuuuper fun! this book is going to sell like gangbusters when it comes out in october. mostly because each and every one of you reading this review are going out and getting yourselves a copy. this is a command. you like books, right? yes, you do, because you are a member of goodreads. and this book is about books! and puzzles! and adventure! there's not a whole lot that's better than that.it is shades of Salamander and The Grand Complication: A Novel and If on a Winter's Night a Traveler and The Name of the Rose , but it is definitely distinctly its own. this book is just a pure joy to read - each character has their own particular skill set, and are quirky without being cutesy about it, and each contributes to solve one hell of a book-mystery involving secret booknerd societies, typography, ancient artifacts, codes and puzzles, the capabilities of computers,and the coolest bookstore you have ever heard of.the mystery is satisfying and the attention to detail is very much appreciated, plus i learned a thing or two. this is one of those books it is better if you discover and experience on your own, so i am not going to say anything else about it, suckers! but this is wild, page-turning fun, and i urge you all to get your hands on a copy if you like books about books. and you do. ...more I am so happy that we happened to be walking past the booth were <---A>Robin Sloan</---A> was signing, and someone was holding up a copy of the attractive ARC trying to lure people onto the line (which I now see the cover has been added to the book on goodreads, the book looks better than the picture suggests).

This is good and I'm thinking if the world has any fairness at all this will be a fairly good selling book this fall. In a perfect world this would go blasting up the sales charts and topple the Fifty Shades craze, but that's not really going to happen but this is one of those books that succeeds at being a good 'page-turner' and fairly smart (and not smart in the way of say, I cribbed all the details from Holy Blood, Holy Grail kind of smart). I'm pretty excited for this book to come out, and fellow book-nerds you should be too. It's about books, and an old bookstore, and hidden secrets mixed with some hacker / internet stuff and it's been written as if it were super-super contemporary (which I think is a little unfortunate, it's written almost too up to the minute for the bookworld, and the references will get dated fairly quickly). It's not the best written book ever, and it's not as smart as say Flame Alphabet , but it's super-fun. It's the kind of book that makes me wish that there were more books like it in existence. It's sort of in the same league as The Shadow of the Wind or a pared down Umberto Eco novel written but William Gibson (or actually by a reigned in Neal Stephenson would be accurate, but he can't seem to write books that aren't gigantic meaty tomes, and this isn't that kind of book). Maybe I'll re-read this book and write more of a review when it gets closer to the October 2nd pub date, but for now take my word on this and put it on your to-read shelf so you don't forget about it! Oh and this book really makes me wish I had been smarter and younger and been the type of person that google would hire. ...more Forgive me, people, this review will be all gushing!

This book charmed me from the very beginning -- with fresh internal monologues, from Clay Jannon, a recent unemployed young man, who just lost his first job out of art school... Then he walks into a bookstore (OMG BOOKSTORE!!) and he climbs the ladder, and I'm in love. How could I not? This book is a love letter for books, bibliophiles, but also for technology. We know that the world of books, publishings, and reading have changed in the recent years, thanks to the wonderful world of Internet. There are ebooks, ereaders (Kindles, Nook, Kobo, etc), and tablets. We start looking for definitions from Google (instead of those huge print dictionaries). We start looking for facts on Wikipedia. It's NEW, it's EXCITING! This book refers to all that. It combines the wonderful world of stories (fonts! printings! hidden messages in stories!!), manual crafting (people making props for movies! Knittings!) and technology (data visualization! GOOGLE! computer language!) and creates a great adventure for a simple reader, like myself. It's not futuristic, it's not high fantasy, it's simply a use of contemporary items around us ... and of course, BOOKS! I'm simply in love with the feeling that this book evokes. I feel like I'm right there with Clay, and his eccletic friends: there's Kat, the smart girl working at Google, there's Neel, his millionaire best-friends who is making money by creating the best BOOBS visual in the world (yes, people, BOOBS!), Mat who is an extraordinaire with props, and of course, Mr. Penumbra, the owner of the store who is also involved in a secret literary group. And it keeps the right balance between books and technology. Just when I think technology will win it all, to solve everything, the book throws a twist. That nope, the great human mind can still win. It's just so, SO amazing. The book is not without flaws . I'm quite disappointed that the whole adventure pretty much happens at Google or at the store. I sort of want the story to go all \"Indiana Jones\" or \"National Treasure\", you know, with secret caves, and such. Also, the very VERY contemporary feeling of this story, might make it go outdated quickly. But in the end, I go back to the whole feeling I have when I'm reading this. It's excitement, it's happiness, it's like being with friends who are really, really enthusiastic about the things I love. \u201cAfter that, the book will fade, the way all books fade in your mind. But I hope you will remember this: A man walking fast down a dark lonely street. Quick steps and hard breathing, all wonder and need. A bell above a door and the tinkle it makes. A clerk and a ladder and warm golden light, and then: the right book exactly, at exactly the right time.\u201d And the last sentence just makes me all shivery and tingly ... because yes, the RIGHT BOOK, at exactly THE RIGHT TIME, will make everything worth while *sigh* ...more I have just lost the will to live.

Have spent two hours writing a review of this brilliant book and then saved it but somehow Goodreads managed to lose it . Will probably kill someone if i sit here any longer so am off to the gym to do something sweaty, noisy and pointless and maybe will try again later. Very f***ing annoyed. Bye for now....................its a brilliant book by the way. I hate the 21st Century sometimes 'Your life must be an open city, with all sorts of ways to wander in' 'All the secrets in the world worth knowing are hiding in plain sight'. 'There is no immortality that is not built on friendship'. For me these three quotations sum up this madcap book. They are the foundation stones on which the whole fabulous edifice is grounded. Fabulous in every way imaginable. 'There is no immortality that is not built on friendship' It is, put simply, the story of a young bloke, Clay Jannon, growing in knowledge of himself through his relationships. Well actually, he is a dude . This word appears to be one of Sloan's favourite ways of describing people and I have said somewhere else that I love this word and all the associations it has in my mind with cool and laid back and being part of an 'in-crowd'. However, in my case, if to be a dude was ever on offer i did not notice and so here i have one of those great moments of imagining myself in amidst this eclectic group of friends. A great piece of middle aged escapism. Anyway this 'dude', having lost his job as a website designer, stumbles across a bookshop in which he gains a shaky foothold and then begins to realize there is far more to its dusty and vertigo inducing bookshelves then first he thought. Sloan's characterization of the different relationships between the main characters is lovely. Their interaction is really believable and the gradual deepening of the various frienships is a joy to behold. 'All the secrets in the world worth knowing are hiding in plain sight' Our hero begins to ask himself questions as he settles deeper into this wonderful shop. 'What are all these books for, couched as they are, in a seemingly pointless and meaningless mixture of letters and numbers?'. 'What are these bunch of eccentric oddbods who flit in and out at all hours grabbing first one book and then another excitedly when none of the books seem to bear any relationship to each other and none seem to mean anything?' He begins to realize there is a quest for something momentous but what it is, he is unsure. It is the search for the solving of this underlying mystery at the heart of the bookshop which is the fascinating triumph for Sloan. Computers, Ancient Printing Presses, Secret Societies and mysterious hidden buildings, sinister, shadowy rumours and theories move and revolve around each other to create an intriguing story which moves back and forth across history cleverly showing the essential truth of the little aphorism quoted above. However it is the fact that the truth of this quotation stretches beyond the book and out into my mind which i found fascinating. What goes unnoticed to me? What truths do i ignore or misunderstand or, more likely, take for granted and dismiss? Sloan has a great imagination. Two little examples of the world he creates; He presents us with a system of storage of information on the web which, in its complicated and far-reaching stretch, seems totally believable and he describes an enormous warehouse in which all discarded and overlooked treasures are kept safely and securely awaiting reclamation or just abandonment. In this warehouse, enormous beyond imagining, the different storage cases and shelves move around via computer programmes as if with a mind of their own as people go to claim or borrow them. Both these creations were so well presented that i felt they must have already existed, they must have been things Sloan was simply describing from reality. His Quidditch if you will, so real that it must already exist somewhere. This is the sign of an excellent imagination and a first rate writer . There is one small little scene in the warehouse involving Clay and a portrait...when you read the book you will know exactly the scene I mean and it made me smile, broadly. That is another strength of Sloan's book, it is not thigh slappingly funny, and I did see Tom Cruise do that very thing on an interview show once so I know there are some idiots who actually do that, no Sloan's book is gently amusing. His dialogue, his descriptions and his plot, all these things make you smile and that can never be bad. There is something for book lovers here and for computer geeks and technophiles, for health freaks and conspiracy theorists and for code breakers and suspense fans. Is there much for those of a love persuasion ?.....Well there is the gentlest fragrance of a romance or two to keep you wondering, there is a heavy musk of testosterone induced hetero bro-mance, there is the incense laden scent of disciple and master and the underlying whiff of hero worship and, of course, the over-riding odour of book-adoration but wherever the love comes from Sloan is saying something of real significance it seems to me. 'Your life must be an open city, with all sorts of ways to wander in' Don't block off those exits or entrances that you think are unusable or defunct. You never know who will enter your life and by which by-way. Any locked door or no entry sign or keep out marker does not protect but impoverishes. Jannon comes to realize that more and more and so do the people with whom he comes into contact. This is, as others have said before, a book of friendship but it is friendship in a myriad of forms. My apologies to Mr Sloan for this paltry attempt at review. The one I toiled over this morning, the one that got away...it was so much bigger and better...lol Seriously though, I loved this book but the GR demon who ate the last review ate a bit of my soul at the same time and I could not bring myself to launch in again. So please, dear reader, take this as a small offering and maybe when i have the heart for it i will try better. It is an excellent book though. ...more HOLY MOLY, BATMAN, EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS. I am actually so excited to write this review... I HAVE SO MANY THINGS TO SAY! Because I have so many thoughts, let's do this bullet-point style. - This story was so positive and mood-uplifting! Geez. I never felt that horrible dread you feel sometimes when you're reading: that loss of faith with the author where you ask the horrible question \"Is the author going to screw this all up?\" All throughout reading the book there were moments where I felt the HOLY MOLY, BATMAN, EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS. I am actually so excited to write this review... I HAVE SO MANY THINGS TO SAY! Because I have so many thoughts, let's do this bullet-point style. - This story was so positive and mood-uplifting! Geez. I never felt that horrible dread you feel sometimes when you're reading: that loss of faith with the author where you ask the horrible question \"Is the author going to screw this all up?\" All throughout reading the book there were moments where I felt the exciting jolt of panic.. \u201cOh no! What\u2019s going to happen?!\u201d but I never felt worry that the story would end badly. It was constantly fun and happy. It made me happy. - I LEARNED SO MUCH. Okay, as a person I love to learn new things, but the truth is that I don\u2019t read very much non-fiction. When reading you are constantly learning new things through the decisions of people, by taking on new perspectives, but in this book I actually learned new facts and things! It felt like I was picking up interesting knowledge and it kept me excited to read. - There were so many great uses of setting in this book. Wowzapants. To places like Hogwarts, to places like Spy Kids, from Google to a knitting museum, this book never felt stagnant. It was fresh and exciting and the settings all felt so legitimate. - The best way I can describe the idea of this book is \u201cNational Treasure for Book Lovers\u201d. I love the National Treasure movies, they are just a good ol\u2019 time, and so was this book! - The characters were so complex! And there were so many of them! We had so many different secondary characters constantly being introduced but the writing never made them feel unnecessary\u2026 in real life we have people that we need for certain things but only interact with very little. This book had lots of different levels of interaction with people, which was new and great. Also, the characters were all super complex and fascinating. None of them felt flat or 1 dimensional.. they were all real people and were constantly surprising. - The collaboration between old and new. Between older people and younger people, older technologies and newer technologies, older thinking and newer thinking. Brilliant! - Speaking of technology, THE TECHNOLOGY. There was such an amazing use of different technologies in this book, but best of all they were all plausible. There are some movies and books where a character pulls out a tool that is specifically designed to solve the exact problem at hand and it\u2019s so unrealistic\u2026 those tools can\u2019t exist! But everything used in this book was real, and it made me feel like this adventure actually happened. - Finally, the main character. WHAT A MAIN CHARACTER! He is exactly the kind of lead you want in this type of story! Constantly clueless BUT TRYING HIS HARDEST, absolutely hilarious, and genuine and earnest. I had such a riot reading this book. And the best part? I know I\u2019m going to love rereading and rereading this book until the end of my days. It was so well crafted and had me in smiles and laughs every time I picked it up. Ultimate recommendation! PS: A shout-out to my main men, Jesse from JesseTheReader and Dylan from DylanBooks, for reading this with me! Talking to them throughout the reading made it even more fun! The mystery had us going and it took us to a happy place :) ...more Authors are magicians. I was in the early pages of Mr. Penumbra when I realized that Sloan was sneaking in a major chain of events in only a few short paragraphs with the intention of moving the story to where he needed it. It was the authorial equivalent of \"look, nothing up my sleeve\" in preparation of a hat trick. Rather than irritation from this momentary flap of curtain or glimpse of rabbit ear, I was rather captivated. Thinking back on books I've loved or hated, it occurs to me that in that Authors are magicians.

It was the authorial equivalent of \"look, nothing up my sleeve\" in preparation of a hat trick. Rather than irritation from this momentary flap of curtain or glimpse of rabbit ear, I was rather captivated. Thinking back on books I've loved or hated, it occurs to me that in that moment of authorial sleight-of-hand, the reader willingness to accept the underlying set-up is fundamental to the experience of the story, particularly in fantasy, sci-fiction and magical realism. A suspension of belief at the right parts, or at least belief enough in the presentation to accept and enjoy it, is crucial to a good read. Penumbra is charming, and it was easy to be interested in Clay's search for a job, intrigued by the mystery of the bookstore, and captivated by the charisma of Clay's friends. Eventually, Sloan reaches a bit too far, tries a large-scale trick that requires more stage presence and set-up than he can pull off. In particular, the New York section started to feel like someone imported The Da Vinci Code . It's the equivalent of seeing a magician at the local theater and watching them try and disappear the Empire State Building. The story veers out of control and falls apart, yet still manages to remain charm and sincerity to be worth reading. Part of Sloan's skill is in his ability to capture familiar emotion. I remember those days when I had job-idealism: \"But I kept at it with the help-wanted ads. My standards were sliding swiftly. At first I had insisted I would only work at a company with a mission I believe in. Then I thought maybe it would be find as long as I was learning something new. After that I decided it just couldn't be evil. Now I was carefully delineating my personal definition of evil.\" There's a lovely, lovely description of a bookstore, instantly familiar to any book-lover: \"The shelves were packed close together, and it felt like I was standing at the border of a forest--not a friendly California forest, either, but an old Transylvanian forest, a forest full of wolves and witches and dagger-wielding bandits all waiting just beyond moonlight's reach. A description of Clay's co-worker, Oliver, instantly resonated with that interesting dualism of solid and dreamy: \"Oliver is a graduate student at Berkeley, studying archeology. Oliver is training to be a museum curator... He speaks in short, simple sentences and always seems to be thinking about something else, something long ago and/or far away. Oliver daydreams about Ionian columns.\" I too have a nebula friend: \"So I guess you could say Neel owes me a few favors, except that so many favors have passed between us now that they are no longer distinguishable as individual acts, just a bright haze of loyalty. Our friendship is a nebula.\" I also have to commend both Clay and Sloan for writing a meeting of a love interest that involves hair, tee-shirt, nail and chipped tooth, culminating with: \"This girls has the spark of life. This is my primary filter for new friends (girl- and otherwise) and the highest compliment I can pay.\" Despite the strong, delightful beginning, Sloan lost me by the end. I thought the quest metaphor was clever, and appreciated the connection with a fantasy trilogy and friend that was instrumental in Clay's formative years but it didn't quite stretch far enough. Or maybe it did, and the quest was an illusion. It's hard to say; Sloan was showing his hand too much by the end and the spy caper didn't fit with the sweet bookstore mystery. The romance was lost in the quest, and imperfectly resolved. Neel's professional fascination with boobs struck me as a false note, although it had the feel of a ten-year-old voyeur over the thirty-year-old creeper. My final complaint is rooting the story so solidly in Google; perhaps integral to Sloan's version of the story, it significantly roots it in time and will date it faster than any other element. For me, these concerns added up to too many wires and mirrors, and allowed me to lose the illusion. Three, three and a half stars. ...more Well, I can't say I've been charmed by a book more in a while, and jealous I didn't write it.

No wonder - who wouldn't want a 24-hour book store? The novel aspires to be classified as a \"literary mystery\", or an \"intelligent thriller\" - both labels are somewhat insulting by suggesting that mysteries and thrillers are by default a lower tier of literature, and Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore is the debut novel by Robin Sloan, and a publishing sensation - it was Amazon's Best Book of the Month in October 2012, and received a lot of attention and praise from reviewers, authors and readers. No wonder - who wouldn't want a 24-hour book store? The novel aspires to be classified as a \"literary mystery\", or an \"intelligent thriller\" - both labels are somewhat insulting by suggesting that mysteries and thrillers are by default a lower tier of literature, and that the classic whodunnit does not require the use of the reader's brain other than to remember what the detective is called, hence the need to emphasize that this particular one is in fact intelligent and should not be grouped together with the common paperback, featuring the latest case of inspector Z in the series Y. Its premise usually aims to be more complex than a simple murder scenario: the protagonist(s) usually search for a long lost document of great importance, one which can change the history of the world. Of course the existence of such a thing is also known to the bad guys, here played by an underground group/secret society. This scheme presents plenty of opportunities to include laboriously researched data, allowing the reader to feel the impression that they're learning facts along with following the plot, which moves at the pace of a \"regular\" thriller - and you've got a bestseller. The poster boy of this movement is of course Dan Brown, who with his The Da Vinci Code shot up to fame and popularity unexpected by anyone; hundreds of novels following aiming to cash in on the scheme have appeared since its publication in 2003. Mr. Penumbra reminded me heavily of Lev Grossman's forgotten novel Codex , which also follows Brown's pattern: Both Penumbra and Codex have a male protagonist who is friends with a computer genius; the central mystery involves a special book (and a secret library) and features the use of contemporary technology to understand its contents. It also struck me as completely plain and almost juvenile, despite being marketed as a work for adults. The characters lack depth and originality, and barely provoke any interest in the reader; from the paper-thin protagonist and his wealthy IT yuppie friend, the love interest - a slim and geeky girl who is of course attractive and willing to be interested in our protagonist (she's described as having feline-like qualities, and is called...Kat) - because the author makes so. Even the old Mr. Penumbra with his quirky name provokes little interest. There's a foreing character from Belarus, who's also hopelessly presented with attempts at a foreign accent and a foreign name of Igor (at least it's not Ivan). Although the book is set in San Francisco, it does not have any sense of the place; it could have been set in any city on the East Coast - or West Coast for that matter, or in truth in any major city in any country: the only references to San Francisco are the mentions of the IT businesses and people profiting or getting laid off, and just once - \"the smell of the ocean\". The setting is like a cardboard prop in a B-movie, threatening to fall apart at the slightest gust of wind. The central mystery does not feel like a mystery at all, as there is no sense of any possible danger looming ahead; although the main character is presented as a man in a tough spot he and his friends always easily find a convenient solution to any problem, which comes at a little to any cost. The novel is short - very short - and packed with references to pop culture and books - communicating via Skype, the inner workings of Google, working at a bookstore and dealing with weird customers - but these references seem to do little for the overall plot, as they are what most of us already experienced and know well. With a well-oiled engine to drive this book forward, the pace slows down, and the road ends up nowhere. I was not surprised when I discovered that the author has initially published a short story , which he later expanded into a novel. I did not find the short story any better, and the added fat did not give the novel any extra merit: it has been done before and better, and undoubtedly will be again. This book is forcefully hip, tries to accomplish too much and accomplishes too little; even as an allegory or fantasy it's too bland and obvious. The comparisons readers and critics make strike me as unbelieveable - Umberto Eco? Neal Stephenson? William Gibson? Really? I remain puzzled by its popularity and the praise it gathered - perhaps the real (and much more interesting) conspiracy lies there. ...more Rating: 3.9* of five The Book Description : A gleeful and exhilarating tale of global conspiracy, complex code-breaking, high-tech data visualization, young love, rollicking adventure, and the secret to eternal life\u2014mostly set in a hole-in-the-wall San Francisco bookstore The Great Recession has shuffled Clay Jannon out of his life as a San Francisco Web-design drone\u2014and serendipity, sheer curiosity, and the ability to climb a ladder like a monkey has landed him a new gig working the night shift a Rating: 3.9* of five The Book Description : A gleeful and exhilarating tale of global conspiracy, complex code-breaking, high-tech data visualization, young love, rollicking adventure, and the secret to eternal life\u2014mostly set in a hole-in-the-wall San Francisco bookstore The Great Recession has shuffled Clay Jannon out of his life as a San Francisco Web-design drone\u2014and serendipity, sheer curiosity, and the ability to climb a ladder like a monkey has landed him a new gig working the night shift at Mr. Penumbra\u2019s 24-Hour Bookstore. But after just a few days on the job, Clay begins to realize that this store is even more curious than the name suggests. There are only a few customers, but they come in repeatedly and never seem to actually buy anything, instead \u201cchecking out\u201d impossibly obscure volumes from strange corners of the store, all according to some elaborate, long-standing arrangement with the gnomic Mr. Penumbra. The store must be a front for something larger, Clay concludes, and soon he\u2019s embarked on a complex analysis of the customers\u2019 behavior and roped his friends into helping to figure out just what\u2019s going on. But once they bring their findings to Mr. Penumbra, it turns out the secrets extend far outside the walls of the bookstore. With irresistible brio and dazzling intelligence, Robin Sloan has crafted a literary adventure story for the twenty-first century, evoking both the fairy-tale charm of Haruki Murakami and the enthusiastic novel-of-ideas wizardry of Neal Stephenson or a young Umberto Eco, but with a unique and feisty sensibility that\u2019s rare to the world of literary fiction.\u00a0Mr. Penumbra\u2019s 24-Hour Bookstore\u00a0is exactly what it sounds like: an establishment you have to enter and will never want to leave, a modern-day cabinet of wonders ready to give a jolt of energy to every curious reader, no matter the time of day. My Review : A bookstore with no customers wanted. A secret society called \u201cThe Unbroken Spine.\u201d A library of books in a code that even Google boffins have trouble breaking. In the end, a resolution to the seemingly mortal combat between tree books and ebooks that will leave the true-hearted reader smiling. Escapist fun. Rollicking silliness. Eccentric amusement. All on offer in heaping helpings, with a garnish of goofy grins. Election season has me on Outrage Overload, and my antidote to any ill is reading a good book. Short of terminal disease, I believe a good read will cure any ailment of mind, body, or spirit. I stopped frothing hysterically about Bain Capital owning an interest in a voting-machine contractor in Ohio for almost an hour while reading this book. Watching the evil-bastard GOP set up for another election steal like 2000 causes me to scream imprecations loudly, so Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore hath wrought a miracle! Take a break from your cares. Read this enjoyable, entertaining book about improbable people doing implausible things to solve an impossible, absurd problem. It will leave you refreshed!

It seemed ridiculous. I know little of the author's background, but the novel itself gave the impression of too strong an effort to tie in lightly researched topics rather than topics of the writer's intimate knowledge. Normally, I like the reference to something I know - it creates a personal attachment to the narrative...that was not the effect of this book. The prose wasn't particularly laudable. After the first 50 pages or so, I found myself skimming the paragraphs and not really feeling like I was missing much via a skim versus a proper read. I can't imagine that this book will fare well with time either: the contemporary references are set in such a way that five or ten years from now, this book will be incredibly dated feeling. Furthermore, there seemed to be numerous details and plot points that seemed totally irrelevant to the story: the core of this story seemed to be about 40 pages long. I'm struggling for positive feedback on this book...it was a short, easy read which made the pain points bearable. ...more Should probably be two stars, but I feel mean and petty today.

Mysterious dusty bookshops and peculiar old men. I think Sloan tried to revamp that old line with some \"hip\" new technology stuff, but he just failed miserably. He almost made me hate Google just by talking about it so much. And he killed any potential for intrigue and adventure in the book by making his main character (oh-so-coincidentally) friends with experts on everything with access to every resource one could possibly need. Need to figure out a code in a book? By golly, guess it's good he's friends with a girl who has access to the best scanner and decoder in the world! Need money? Not a problem, 'cause his elementary-school best friend is a millionaire! Need a moveable scanner? Luckily he knows just the site to find one, and a stranger is willing to build and transport it to him! Needs to know about ancient art shit? Thank the Lord his co-worker is an archaeological genius! Christ. Sloan was clearly a Harry Potter fan, so I'm just glad he didn't write that series: \"'We have to find the horcruxes!' Harry realized. He logged onto the horcrux database and typed a simple search: 'horcruxes AND voldemort OR he-who-must-not-be-named.' Seven results! Perfect! But how to destroy them? Harry called up Dumbledore, who had made his fortune building a special transportable Horcrux Deactivator made of wizard cardboard. Hedwig fetched it for him immediately, and Harry utilized it to great effect. All was well.\" Yes, technology can make things easier. And I appreciate that Sloan didn't ignore it--too many books nowadays build elaborate plot points around things that could be solved with a simple Google (yes, Google again!) search. But he went too far in the other direction and killed his own story's intrigue. I thought the climax of the story was terribly underwhelming. I had no interest in any of the characters. I appreciate what Mr. Sloan was trying to do, but it fell flat for me. Things felt rather gimmick-y. It's probably a bad sign when the best thing about your book is that it glows in the dark. Sigh. What a mean review this is. I feel a bit bad about it, actually. If the book sounds really interesting to you, go ahead and read it.

The writing is really witty and I was caught off guard quite a few times by the unexpectedly funny twists in storytelling. BUT... oh, how I was disappointed towards the end. The interesting parts of the story just fall apart and there are a few trips to dullsville. The whole reveal of the code was a major letdown, which I thought did not suit the rest of the book at all. I was loving this book up until that last 3rd, and it feels like the writer just handed the rest of the story off to someone who didn't know how to make it connect to the beginning. For that lame ending, I'm giving this 4.5 stars - and trust me, it is killing me to do that to one of my favorite books of the year so far.

The theme also allowed for scenes that reminded me of other books and movies, from Lord of the Rings, Canticle for Leibowitz, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Shadow of the Wind, and, strangely enough, O Brother Where Art Thou. There were so many parts of this book I wish I could quote here! But I will restrain myself and wait until it is published in October. Until then, I will content myself with recommending it enthusiastically. This book is fun .

Unsurprisingly, doesn't manage to pass the Bechdel test, and if it does, it does so barely. The point, of course, of the Bechdel test is that it's a laughably low bar for involvement of female characters in your plot and so even if you manage to just barely pass it, there is still something deeply problematic about your story. 5. The main distinction between characters in this novel is which precise arcane subject they are obsessed with. Is it fonts? Is it miniature practical effects? Ancient architecture? Data visualization? Life extension? In typical nerdbro fashion, people are not interesting for their emotional or psycho-social development (we are left to conclude they have none) but rather for their nerdly obsessions. I have no problem with nerdly obsessions, except that they are a poor substitute for actual character development. 6. Without spoiling anything, I can tell you that apparently the moral of the story is we get by with a little help from our friends (wow, such deep, so learning, wow) except the author undermines his own point by actually having the main character go lone wolf in the last third of his quest. So, friends are good but you, oh sensitive nerdbro, are also the mighty lone hero. YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL including this muddled conclusion. 7. Did you forget about boobs? HOW COULD YOU??

Mr. Penumbra\u2019s 24-Hour-Bookstore is a book with a perfectly charming premise and a number of flaws. The premise, is, of course, what landed it on my to-read list nearly two years ago, and, I\u2019d imagine, the list of many another bibliophile. The book centers on the new night-shift employee at a 24-Hour-Bookstore in San Francisco, who has taken the job after being laid off from his tech-start up in the Great Recession of the late aughts. He works from 10 pm to 6 am under the elderly, mysterious Mr. Penumbra and his even more mysterious clientele. For, while there is a (very idosyncratic and eccentrically chosen) bookstore at the front of his establishment (which only the occasional stripper from the club next door buys from), his real customers come for the good stuff in the back, which Clay (our protagonist) is told never to read. They appear at all hours of the day and night, borrowing books and returning them in fevers of excitement. And of course, like with any plot where there is a big red button one is very explicitly NOT to press, the day comes when Clay opens one of the books in the back. And then we begin the main plot, finding ourselves in the midst of a hundreds of years old cult of book-worshippers, secret puzzles and codes and a ragtag group of characters that stretches from your expected conservative cult leaders to modern-day tech CEOs and programmers, all thrown together by the draw of solving a puzzle. It sounds like a premise that should work- it really is a new twist on the literary cult mystery, trying to see what it might mean for a generation with new ideas and new technology. Sloan definitely creates a true-to-life feeling about how many younger people would process finding something like this in their life: way that many characters treat this as a Saturday-night trivia exercise rather than the serious undertaking any other book would present it as (the part where they are on the major, dramatic bit of their \u201cquest\u201d and the two characters with actual jobs/lives are taking meetings, going to work and obsessed with stuff on their phones and only keeping half an eye on the main mystery felt really true). I also liked how Sloan really stared pretty unflinchingly in the face of the idea that computers can do decades of human work in minutes or hours and hinted at some of the different kinds of knowledge that that offers- is it \u201ccheating\u201d? She definitely refused to indulge in a great part of the romanticism that a lot of us book-lovers cherish for our favorite hobby. I also appreciated that the main female character was allowed, at least a few crucial points, to not conform to being just a wish-fulfillment for the main character. But unfortunately, that\u2019s about it for the positives. None of which has anything to do with the most important parts of a book. All of which I felt this book failed at or at the very least did a very lackluster job of showing. Let\u2019s start with the plot, which I never found in the least suspenseful. The main character finds a problem and solves a problem within pages-usually not even by virtue of his own ingenuity (he even admits this towards the end of the book, that everything gets solved because he brings the problem to someone else). Even as the plot ramped up towards the end, there was never any mad dash or suspense- we\u2019re flying quite comfortably on Jet Blue, thank you, and able to go about our normal lives for 3/4 of the time we\u2019re on this \u201cadventure\u201d (both other main characters use vacation days and branch offices in order to go on the journey- it\u2019s a pretty disappointingly responsible and middle-manager way to go on a quest). There\u2019s no sense anyone is ever really in danger (ooooh no, what if the book nerds discover you\u2019re in their secret library during unapproved hours??? I wonder if he will be able to escape the grasping arms of octogenarians who have spent their whole lives underground bent over large books???)- the greatest danger is the occasional fear of embarrassment. And, and this is something of a spoiler, but honestly you won\u2019t be surprised by the time you get there\u2026. the climax is told by means of a powerpoint slideshow. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a more depressing way for an author to try to indicate triumph. And let\u2019s not even get started about the fact that a solid 100 pages of this read like an advertisement for how great it is to work at Google. I also found myself reading this book from a great distance. It\u2019s told in the first-person, and the book we\u2019re holding is supposedly written by the narrator. However, despite deploying these multiple ways of hooking your reader into a personal relationship the main character, I still found myself outside the book . I never felt that moment of \u201cI feel you, bro,\u201d or found myself sympathizing for his struggles. Perhaps because the man himself never really let me see him beyond the surface- he told me about wanting to punch guys his girlfriend spent time with, or feeling surreal about some of the things he\u2019s noticing, \u201cLike, OMG, isn\u2019t this so weird,\u201d and being too much of a sissy to open the books he\u2019s not supposed to open (though he takes credit for it later), but that's all I got. I think this also was at least in part due to an odd, seemingly minor, choice the author made to have the narrator's thoughts written indistinguishably from the general description and narration of plot, without italics or some other thought tag. This meant that I would often read his thoughts without the feeling they were supposed to be read with. I did occasionally like Kat, especially towards the end of the novel when Sloan really emphasized how much of her own person she is, rather than a function of the book\u2019s technology vs. books narrative. But Neel\u2019s whole thing (and his virtual boobs company) felt like a weird, absurdist element thrown in to make the book feel more postmodern. He belonged in some other book by Franzen or Wallace, but he definitely didn\u2019t belong here. And Sloan really half-assed the mysterious, ancient appeal of Penumbra and the whole cult- she made them dusty shams past their prime whose ancient rites and rituals were easily taken apart by technology. Which, I suppose, would probably be true of a lot of organizations like this (especially if they are technophobic and don\u2019t change with the times-lookin\u2019 at you, DaVinci Code ). But then\u2026 what\u2019s the point of this book? I don\u2019t get it. Was centuries of work and dedication really there for an unemployed dude in his late-twenties who needed a self-esteem boost? That makes me want to side with the grumpy old cult members who are pissed that you took the meaning out of their hobby. I really thought, actually, after all the hints it gave us, that the book was going to go with \u201cit\u2019s all about the journey, not the destination\u201d at the end and I was prepared to accept that as part of a growing-up shift in priorities for our hero, and when it went with what it did instead in the end, I didn\u2019t even know what to do with it. Because you\u2019re trying to tell me this is a book about friendship instead? And how valuable it is? Really? But you spent this book having your main character use his friends and manipulate them into doing what they wanted, so\u2026 how does that make sense? The examples of older friends in this book appear delusional and out of touch with each other, willing to use their friendship to try and twist minds and hearts. And don\u2019t even get me started on how you stuck Kat on as a pretty bow on the end, when the entire book had made the case that that would be a horrible idea for everyone involved. Even the whole effort to \u201csave\u201d Mr. Penumbra didn\u2019t feel real- I never understood why this guy was so motivated to help him, given that they had barely any interactions, he judged him constantly and he had known him for less than a few months. The work to establish the relationship, or at least the allure, of Mr. Penumbra, was never done. I can\u2019t even process this as a deconstruction of all of those literary conspiracy, secret society type books out there, because if your only point is \u201cwell technology would destroy that in a second,\u201d then you are missing the point of that entire genre by dismissing it with a surface clever observation better suited to a New Yorker Shouts and Murmurs column than a serious book length treatment. I also don\u2019t really think satire was the point in the end- too many pieces of the puzzle were left intact- because they were ineffectively drawn to begin with. So I guess\u2026 in the end I don\u2019t really understand what this book was for. Who was it supposed to appeal to? You\u2019ve annoyed bibliophiles, you\u2019ve alienated a lot of readers over thirty, never mind serious readers of fiction and character studies who like to attach to your characters\u2026 and I don\u2019t understand why. Why are you ruining the fun without having something useful to say about why you\u2019re doing it? I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m asking. I left this book still not understanding. If you\u2019re aiming for anything like satire of or comment on a genre and still expect the target audience to buy it, you better tease with love and understanding and be so devastatingly accurate there\u2019s nothing they can do about it, and then you had better let them know that you get them and you\u2019re one of them at the end. (Please see Susanna Clarke\u2019s Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell for reference on how to do this in beyond brilliant fashion.) And all you had was a powerpoint slideshow at the end? I\u2019m sorry to all you neglected books who deserve to be pulled out of eternal middle-of-the-pile land, but this book was not one of you. ...more Spoilers I didn't read any reviews or even the synopsis for this - I bought it on a whim because I liked the cover and title.

I thought a jobless-down-on-their-luck-underdog type character would start working at Penumbra's and thus their life would change, lessons would be learnt, friends would be made, and people from different walks of life would come together and share their passion for books and a special little bookstore. Alas, that wasn't the case. Instead I got secret cults, quests for immortality, ancient codes and other such nonsensical nonsense. It's my own fault really, if I'd bothered to do the tiniest bit of research, I wouldn't have been expecting a quirky tale about a 24-hour bookshop. I still rather enjoyed it but it wasn't quite as homey, booky and wonderful as I'd thought it would be. The characters were a bit of a mixed bag. The main character (I've already forgotten his name\u2026 Let's call him Bob) was boring and geeky. I think he was meant to be endearing and likeable but he was just plank-like and dull. Bob's love interest, Kat, was annoying\u2026 Especially when she kept banging on about life and immortality and whatnot. I'm guessing she was meant to be a restless, profound, eager spirit of some sort but she just didn't work for me as a character. There were a few characters that I genuinely liked - Neel, Penumbra, Mat, Lapin and Tyndall. They had more attitude and charm than what's his name and Kat. The main characters and the narration reminded me quite a lot of John Green's books. Bob was basically an older version of John Green's male protagonists, and Kat was an older version of his female characters. Only Bob and Kat weren't quite as annoying and pretentious as Green's geeky male characters, and 'deep' female characters. The mystery of the bookstore with its strange patrons, bizarre rules and weird customers intrigued me at first\u2026 But I lost interest once I found out those things were all related to a secret cult whose mission was to decode some old book and thus live forever\u2026 It was all so far-fetched, unrealistic and ridiculous. I disliked all the computing/programming/google talk \u2014 none of those things interest me. All in all, I was mostly entertained. I probably would have liked it more if I'd actually known what the book was about before starting it. ...more August 2012: (First, I never read the short story because by the time I discovered it I already knew it was a novel so I didn't want to ruin anything for myself...you know, just in case.

And while this is happening, you realise: damn, I look good. Why do I love it? Well, it's a good-hearted, optimistic book about friendship and being alive and the lure of the mysterious. It's a book which shows you Google the way Google sees itself, and bookshops the way bookshops ought to be. It's a tonal roadmap to a positive relationship between the old world and the new. It's a book which gets it. Plus, you know: book cults, vertical bookshops, hot geeks, theft, and the pursuit of immortality. This book is in my emotional heartland. I want to live in Robin Sloan's world. And yes, I too would freeze my head. ...more What an engaging mystery, set in a fantastical book store three stories high--with no stairs, just ladders! It is written in the first person, from the point of view of a young clerk, Clay Jannon, who was hired for the graveyard shift.

There are no murders in the story; the mystery is what on earth is going on with these creepy customers and crazy bookstore? Is it a front for some sinister enterprise? Why all the secrecy? Jannon gets two friends to help him solve these mysteries and more. One friend, a young woman who works for Google, has incredible computational resources at her command, while a boyhood friend has big financial resources. How can a Goodreads member not like a book where so much of the action takes place in a bookstore, includes data visualization, high-tech puzzle-solving, and where typeface fonts play a major role in the story-line? The book is rather short, but definitely a fun read! ...more 3.5* A really unique and cool book! I don't really know what to rate it to be honest because there were a lot of things I liked but also some things I didn't, and I just wasn't blown away!

Well, good for you!\" It's a book designed to make the bibliophile break out into a near terminal case of the warm fuzzies, overcome with a sudden desire to break out a blanket, brew a pot of tea or coffee, and settle into a comfortable chair for a day of hardcore reading until--oh, wait!--I'm already doing all of that! Si A charming, quietly amusing book, Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore is the literary equivalent of a congratulatory pat on the back in recognition of loving books. \"Oh, you read? Well, good for you!\" It's a book designed to make the bibliophile break out into a near terminal case of the warm fuzzies, overcome with a sudden desire to break out a blanket, brew a pot of tea or coffee, and settle into a comfortable chair for a day of hardcore reading until--oh, wait!--I'm already doing all of that! Silly me! So the only thing one can do is snuggle into the cushions more deeply and turn the pages more quickly. Now, for those who know me, that probably comes across as a bit snarky and, to be fair, it is and it isn't. I admit that there's a part of me whose switch isn't flipped by these books that so overtly and blatantly cater to bibliophilia. After all, I'm a lifelong reader and it seems a bit daft me reading a book about loving to read a book. But, damn it, there's a part of me that can't help but be beguiled by it and, if I'm going to go down that road, it might as well be with Mr. Penumbra and crew. Despite a certain predictability and a certain lack of suspense, there's nothing too twee or adorable about it, and the characters are quirky without being too eccentric and are amusing without being too culturally hip, self-referential, and smugly ironic. These are people I wouldn't mind knowing and people I can imagine existing. Clay Jannon is struggling in his career and in life. A victim of the recession, Clay's once promising public relations career has imploded. Having to redefine his vision of the future, Clay needs both money and direction. He finds both in a \"Help Wanted\" sign outside of Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore. Thankful to find gainful employment, it takes Clay a while to acknowledge the peculiarities of a 24-Hour bookstore. An excited clientele eagerly returns night after night to check out books from the \"Way Backlist,\" a group of books on impossibly high shelves. The bookstore doesn't so much sell books as loan them to members for purposes Clay can only imagine. It's not long before Clay finds himself embroiled in secret literary societies, an impossible ancient puzzle, an adorable Googler, and a breakthrough that may exist at the nexus of the written word and technology. I loved the narrator's unusual sense of humor and, despite myself, even grinned over some predictable tropes. So why only a 3? Well, it's more like a 3 1/2. Despite enjoying it, it didn't linger long in memory and the unraveling of the mystery wasn't particularly satisfying. Granted, the mystery here serves as more of a MacGuffin that allows Sloane (via Clay) to wax at length about the glories of reading, whether they be in the form of a book, an ebook, or an audiobook (all readers are welcome here), as well as the glorious possibilities afforded the human imagination through technology, but I still wanted a resolution with more substance given the build-up. Again, 3 1/2 stars. And I would be lying if I said that half star isn't being thrown in just because of the extra bit of delight in realizing that, when I placed the book on the nightstand and turned off the light, it freaking glowed in the dark! I felt like a 7 year old getting excited over those glow in the dark planetary stickers. I'm telling you, this damn thing is just a giddy machine.

The Google butt-kissing started early, and served to make it so that I never once found Kat appealing or endearing.

Google was really the main character here. The Google butt-kissing started early, and served to make it so that I never once found Kat appealing or endearing. In fact, I felt that she was just a big, whiny child playing with shiny toys and having a temper tantrum when the things around her didn't go exactly her way. She basically represents everything about my generation that is awful, and is the reason why so many of us are struggling to find jobs (NOT at Google where, quite honestly, I had been desperate to work until I read this book). Our generation has a terrible reputation, and Sloan does a great job showcasing why, frankly, I wouldn't want to work with us either. The vast majority of the characters in this book feel entitled to knowledge that they haven't earned. Much like the ill-fated scientists in Jurassic Park , they stand on the shoulders of those who came before and - having skipped the hard work that requires patience and discipline - wield their new power with tremendous immaturity and disregard for the hard work of others. They also seemed to forgo adherence to things like laws, binding contracts, and the general principles of ownership since, you know, basic and understandable societal rules are in the way of what they want. (view spoiler) [I mean, for G-d's sake, they STEAL the property of a secret society and then just give it to Google. What on EARTH makes them think they have any right to do that? How did they not go to jail? The book BELONGED to the Unbroken Spine. It would have been one thing to steal it and try to decode it in the privacy of their homes using advanced technology, but to simply GIVE SOMEONE'S PROPERTY to one of the largest companies on Earth with zero consequences disgusted me. (hide spoiler) ] I also started to get sick of all these extraordinarily talented - and, in most cases, very wealthy and highly educated - characters spending all this time standing around and patting each other on the back for being so wonderful. The ending would really only be possible for super-rich, talented, and connected folks, not the average person looking for work or struggling through life in SF, a reality faced by myself and many of my friends every day. Most of us don't have rich friends to bail us out when we get stuck in crummy, going-nowhere jobs after plunging ourselves into debt for our now-useless degrees. (view spoiler) [Lucky for Clay, his happy ending is afforded to him by his chums with deep pockets. Hurray for Clay! Hurray for money! Isn't life wonderful? (hide spoiler) ] This book, while initially promising, was really a love note to entitlement and privilege. It left me feeling angry about the state of the world, especially the state of the city I cherish so much; a city where now, students can't afford to live even in basement \"apartments\" because these start-up tech industry folks will pay out the butt for them, so rent has been blown sky high. Screw you, Sloan, for trying to paint some sort of jaunty, sympathetic portrait of these hapless, childish, selfish idiots who are making life utter hell for the rest of us by sucking so hard at caring about anyone but themselves. It was also especially revolting to see the rampant nepotism of start-ups (which has screwed so many of us out of positions we've worked hard and studied hard to fill) played off as some cute, meaningful artifact of extra-best-friendship. This book encapsulates everything that sucks about SF right now, everything that sucks about my generation, in a 300-page nutshell. So, unless you want to read about some uber-privileged hipsters making all their dreams come true with loads of money and unearned knowledge, I suggest you take a hard pass on this one. ...more Clay Jannon is a 26 year old who finds himself looking for a new job thanks to the economic meltdown.

This will be a hard book to review without giving away any spoilers but I will try my best. Mr Penumbra\u2019s 24-Hour Bookstore starts off as an exciting mystery when Clay begins his new job and is faced with a lot of unanswered questions. But I soon found myself being bored with what was happening and almost quit. It did change its gears when Clay has found out what is going on and the adventure begins. Though I think it was a little too late to fully revive this novel for me. I do like the way Robin Sloan blended mystery and literature together but honestly he really lacks the skills to turn this into something as good as The Shadow of the Wind. I will say that the novel does display a glimpse at a possibly great career. I found myself thinking the adventure elements of this book were too generic and predictable but that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t enjoy reading it. There is a love story in the novel but it wasn\u2019t a romance between Clay and Kat. Sure that was there, but that was just a predictable boy meets girl and nothing ever goes wrong with their relationship. That isn\u2019t worth mentioning, the love story I\u2019m talking about is the love that author Robin Sloan has with Google; the whole book reads like a love letter to Google. The characters didn\u2019t have to try and solve anything; they just need Google to solve all the mysteries of this book. I haven\u2019t mentioned the characters in the book because they felt very one dimensional; there was nothing complex about them and everything felt too neat. Sloan might have a career in thriller adventure novels but I think he really needs to learn how to make the characters flawed and realistic. I\u2019m sure if another book of Sloan\u2019s catches my attention I will read it but Mr Penumbra\u2019s 24-Hour Bookstore failed to excite me the way it should have. I like books about books but maybe my expectations were a little too high.
