If this didn't annoy you at all, reread this book (NOT RECOMMENDED) and realize that this dude spent most of his life passed out. Then try to tell me you didn't notice it. Although this book was fast passed, a lot of it was filler and this book could really just have been shrunken into about 100 pages at the max. I gave this book 2 stars only because <---A>James Dashner</---A> was able to create such real characters by giving them actual human qualities. This is mostly referring to Newt and Minho since they seemed the most real and fleshed out. This compared to other characters like Thomas who had about as much personality and emotion as a burnt piece of rat meat on a stick. He's also about as smart as that which I don't understand since all the Gladers were suppose to be extremely smart children who where put in the maze from the last book because of their high IQs. Apart from the few inconsistencies in this book, the one thing that never made any sense to me was that if everyone in there is suppose to be named after super smart person (like Isaac Newton, etc), then who is Frypan named after? If someone figures it out, please tell me.<---F> EDIT: P</---F>.S I think I get that Frypan is a nickname now thanks. ...more What the hell?

Even though I have sometimes enjoyed a book and not really liked the sequel, it's very rare that I would love one and absolutely hate the other. I desperately tried to finish it but I was bored, I kept getting distracted by either my family, my cats or some random fluff on the carpet... so I just skim-read it to the end and gave myself a basic idea of what the conclusion was. I truly loved The Maze Runner , even though quite a few people found it annoying - particularly the protagonist - and not the best written book ever. I found myself dragged into the maze with them, trying to solve the mystery - why are they there? How do they get out? Can they get out? And so on. But this second in the trilogy(?) was so disappointing. Thomas was even more annoying, we'd already lost the best character (Chuck) at the end of book one and the story just didn't grab me. Maybe because it took me a while to get what they were meant to do - cross a desert basically - and when I got it I thought \"how lame\". I just felt nothing for this novel,<---M> the characters</---M>, the plot. I wanted it to end and that's never good. Mostly I felt as if Dashner himself didn't know where he was going with it. Where The Maze Runner was structured and clever, this story all felt a bit random and haphazard. I found myself wishing that the author could have just rounded the first book off at the end and not bothered with a second installment - it seemed more like a money-making scheme than a contribution to the overall story. Plus, Thomas must be both the most boring and unrealistic character ever. Another thing that annoyed me in both books, but stood out more in this one because it didn't have a gripping plot to distract me from it, is that the author tells you everything. A good author knows how to show the way things are, if that makes sense, and it makes for much better writing. Dashner continually tells the reader what Thomas or whoever is feeling rather than letting them realise it for themselves; instead of saying something along the lines of \"Thomas' eyes grew cloudy with suppressed tears\", he would instead say \"Thomas was really upset\". And, therefore, it simply did not flow. But the worst thing for me is the constant inexplicable 'sensing' going on. Countless times in the novel Thomas \"just knows\" that something is dangerous or an individual can be trusted because he gets a \"feeling\" - and just how the hell does he do that? There is no rational explanation for it and the author doesn't seem to be developing some sixth sense storyline as of yet. It all seems a bit ridiculous to me. That's why I won't be reading The Death Cure , it's unfortunate because I was really looking forward to this sequel. ...more How can an author start a trilogy with such a fascinating world-building, create endearing and strong characters and build up suspense and intrigue inside a complex and admirable plot\u2026 and then write this ?

I.did.not.care. I did not care about the romance. I did not want any romance. Honestly, I could say I adored the first book, but there\u2019s one thing that irked me until the last page and that is the existence of Teresa. I always thought her incongruous presence disrupted the order of things in book one along with its atmosphere. But, well, I was willing leave my differences aside, for the sake of Thomas. It did not last long. How could she do that? I\u2019m in much disapproval with the plot. I don\u2019t care if there is a reason behind what happens, and what Teresa does; I still think it wasn\u2019t right and that the man who wrote The Maze Runner could have come up with a less frustrating idea. This felt more like a journey into nothingness that a concrete and eloquent plot. It\u2019s impossible not to lose focus when reading this sequel. I mean, I tried to, I tried very hard, but man does nothing of interest happen. Unlike in the first book, Thomas doesn\u2019t slowly build relationships with others around him (new people he meets) \u2026 he keeps to himself as much as he can, when <---C>Brenda</---C> and Teresa are not around and that just remove a lot of the charm I thought he once had. The random people that cross his path are so dull and the dialogs even duller, therefore, my mind often simply diverged. Because of that, very few secondary characters felt three dimensional to me. And the setting\u2026 how depressive it is; an eight-year-old could\u2019ve imagined the pitiful setting. And those monsters\u2026 I really can\u2019t wait to see what they look like in the movie. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll get a good laugh out of it. But then again, the producers probably modified them, because come on . Everyone loves Minho (including myself) but can I just mention how unsexy he is in this? He\u2019s always shouting at people or stressing out about a thousand little things. There is danger to freak over, that for sure, but couldn\u2019t the author offer us, from time to time, a side of him that\u2019s just lovely? Sigh. There is some good in the story too\u2026 such as\u2026 the writing! The writing is indeed nice. I\u2019m still going to read The Death Cure , seeing that I can\u2019t just NOT know how it ends. PS. Thomas, please stop fainting. We\u2019re not in the medieval ages and there aren\u2019t that many girls acknowledging your presence. ...more Sigh.

I wasn't a fan of the first one, and yet I still decided to give <+++>The Scorch Trials</+++> a try. Somehow, this one was worse than the The Maze Runner . How so? Let me count the ways... 1. Character development. James Dashner deserves an award for achieving the impossible by being the first author to establish negative character development. I cared even less about the main characters than I did in the first book. Everyone started to blend together and there was no one character with any distinguishing features. Thomas/Minho/Newt were practically interchangeable, and I swear Teresa and Brenda were the same person. Oh, I guess Jorge's dialogue was pretty memorable though... in the sense that every sentence he said ended with the word \"muchacho.\" I don't think it can get any more stereotypical than that. Putting the main characters aside, it seemed like Dashner just threw up his hands and said \"Oh, shuck it!\" when it came to giving the other Gladers even a splash of personality. (view spoiler) [At the end of the book, when a bunch of the Gladers died/didn't make it to the Safe Haven, Thomas thought something to the extent of, \"Oh well, I didn't know them very well anyway.\" Even Thomas didn't care about these people! (hide spoiler) ] 2. Writing style. This is the type of book that convinces me anyone can get a book published. Something about the way Dashner describes things is so offputting that it just makes me cringe. The dialogue is predictable and not at all clever. Emotions are for the most part relayed through phrases like \"Thomas was angry\" and \"Thomas didn't know why he was so frustrated.\" Some of the descriptions were akin to a five-year old's writing. I distinctly remember one part where Thomas was taken aback at the sight of blood, and he called it \"crimson goo.\" ... Let's all take a moment to reflect upon such inspired word choices. 3. Storyline. While the Scorch Trials are considerably \"action-packed,\" they somehow don't feel substantial. I couldn't put my finger on why this bothered me so much at first, but I think I've figured it out now. This book was like a YA and crappier version of the TV show LOST . A series of mysterious events occur, monsters pop out of nowhere, the motives behind WICKED are unknown, memories are clouded, etc. While that's all fine and dandy, the thing that's irksome is that there is no way every single one of these mysteries will be explained in the last book. What was the purpose of the maze? What are Grievers? How do Thomas/Teresa/co. have the ability to communicate telepathically? How did WICKED choose what variables to include? Why was it necessary for Thomas to be betrayed? Okay, even if they're not answered in the second book - fine. I like suspense as much as the next person, and I enjoy guessing... but if Dashner thinks he can build me up and not answer a SINGLE one of these questions, then he is delusional. And if these questions ARE answered in the last book and I'm totally wrong.................... I apologize for jumping to conclusions, Mr. Dashner. Maybe I shouldn't be so prematurely irritated. (But I seriously doubt he'll deliver.) 4. This entire book is pointless. As in, it literally contributes nothing to the plotline. It doesn't feel as if any forward progress has been made. I bet if I read The Maze Runner , skipped this book, and went straight into The Death Cure , I wouldn't be missing out. The important outcomes of this book can be summarized in about three sentences; I feel like Dashner wrote it just to make the series a trilogy. Anyway, sorry for being a rambling Debbie Downer. I feel better for getting all that out though, whew... unfortunately, I'm just setting myself up for more self-inflicted torture because I'm still going to read The Death Cure . I've already made it this far, so I owe it to myself to justify the pain of reading The Scorch Trials and at least finish the damn series. I mean... the third book can't be worse than this one... right? ... Right? ...more I AM SO CONFUSED RIGHT NOW. I hate it when people do that. Don't you just want to tell them,\" okay, calm down.

Now there are other references besides that darn Thomas the Train and Thomas Edison... boring. Anyway, this book was titillating. Sometimes I felt like Dashner was purposefully being a big tease by pulling the wool over Thomas' eyes one too many times, but I still loved it. There was something in the book about killing someone to get food... I don't think I would kill for the next book in the series, because then I'd be sent to the crazy place, but I still want it really really bad. REALLY, REALLY BAD. Now I'm doing it again... Now I can do my homework in peace. Hopefully. I'll probably surf the web for other people's thoughts on the ending instead... Until The Death Cure . Want to see my future reviews?

This book did more of the latter than the former. I enjoyed The Maze Runner; however, it got pretty confusing towards the end, and I was hoping that The Scorch Trials would give us some answers. Not so. If anything, it only leaves the reader with even more questions. Practically nothing was resolved/explained from the first book, and James Dashner kept on piling on more and more plot twists\u2013\u2013most of which were \u2026\u00a0well \u2026 I didn't think they were good plot twists. Just needlessly confusing ones. So, there's another Glade with all girls and one boy? And what's up with Teresa? Is she evil? Is she possessed or something? She was talking to Aris in her head the whole time? Wha \u2026 ?! *Tears out hair* THIS MAKES NO SENSE. ARRRGH. The whole thing seems a bit careless and unplanned, like Dashner decided on these plot twists as he was writing the second book. The story is pretty hard to follow. Yes, it's exciting, it's unpredictable (but not really in a good way), it's fast-paced. But often I'm confused about where the characters are, how much time has gone by, etc. And the characters themselves \u2026 I don't like them very much. There's nothing particularly interesting/original about Thomas or Teresa. The minor characters surrounding them are all pretty much the same; I get them all mixed up. I miss Chuck. D: Although I did like Brenda \u2026 not really sure what the deal with her is, but I think she's way cooler than Teresa. Then there's the writing. Urgh. I know I complained about this in my review of the first book, but really. One of the first things you're supposed to learn about writing is \"SHOW, DON'T TELL\". Dashner has a tendency to spell out Thomas's feelings for us. On top of that, he's obsessed with fragments. So combined, the writing goes a little like this: \"Thomas was scared. Really scared. Like, terrified.\" Now, at least these books have some originality. As frustrating as they are, they keep me reading. I'm curious to know what happens. I'm really hoping that we get some answers in the next book. (Please tell me that this is only a trilogy? If there's more than three books \u2026\u00a0Well, I don't think I'm going to read more than three.) ...more Sorry to break the bad news But...Guys..You have to Run Again...

Thomas, honeybunch? We need to talk. What exactly happened here? In the first book, you were a huge Gary Stu, yes, but you also captured my heart with your endearing awkwardness.

For the Scorch Trials, I still wanted to play the mom, but the kind that whacks you a new one so you'll sort your shit out. How the hell did you go from this: To this: Half Thomas, honeybunch?

How the hell did you go from this: To this: Half the book was you mooning over Teresa and this other girl, Brenda. Are you sure Nora from Crescendo didn't undergo a hostile takeover? For a book that claims it's The Hunger Games for dudes, you have more Paranormal Romance vibes than THG does, what with the goo-goo eyes, she-loves-me-she-loves-me-not, and a completely unnecessary love triangle. \"That they were safe, that he and Teresa could get to know each other again. That life could be good.\" \"Oddly, the thing that stood out the most to Thomas was Teresa's last name.\" \"Thomas found himself hoping she was the Brenda girl Jorge had mentioned.\" \"Brenda didn't take her eyes off Thomas. As for him, he still felt the tingle that had shot through his entire body when she'd touched him with her lips.\" \"Something stirred inside him, mixed with guilt and longing for Teresa.\" \"Once again, Thomas felt a ridiculous surge of guilt like he was cheating on Teresa. He couldn't help that this girl was so touchy-feely.\" Teresa, Brenda, why do you even exist? There's no difference between the two of you. You're not characters, you're props used to further Thomas's love life. That's your label: Thomas' Love Interest 1 and Thomas' Love Interest 2. (view spoiler) [It's more apt than The Betrayer. (hide spoiler) ] And both of you are impossibly gorgeous too. I'm against the large amount of hot male love interests in YA and I'm against you too. Remove the fanservice headband and grow some personality. Please. Minho, babe, you were the only thing that kept me afloat in this sea of teenage hormones and mediocre writing. You were a gem in the first book: leader of the Runners, competent, yet you ran off during an extremely important moment. That only made me love you more because you were reacting exactly like an a scared teenage boy. Then, you redeemed yourself further by coming back to help Thomas. Here, you're the leader, the rock that keeps everyone moving. Even when the people you're supposed to protect die, you push on, not allowing yourself to cry. You should be the main character, not Thomas. I perked up when you entered the scene, and face-palmed when you departed (because Thomas had to go off for 'bonding time'). It's because of you that I'm going to read the last book. And to find out what happens. Mediocre writing and sucky romance aside, the author can spin an entertaining story. So stay alive and stay wonderful. Sincerely, A fan who's still holding out for the magic of The Maze Runner. P.S. If you kill Minho for a shitty reason, I will be very unhappy .

Me ha gustado bastante, aunque no tanto como El corredor del laberinto. Eso s\u00ed, veo algunos cabos sueltos y personajes que no han evolucionado nada. \u00a1Con ganas de leer el tercero ya! WICKED is good. Nah. Where should I begin? Firstly, this was by no means as good as the first book. The first book was a mix of thrill and adventure and the mystery surrounding everything was something that gave the chills. On the other hand, the second novel failed to give me the goosebumps and I would sometimes lose interest. The storyline felt dragged on and phase two was a boiled potato.

I felt like Mr. Dashner put all the characters and had them running around like pigs for nothing. It kind of got on my nerves and frustrated the hell out of me. The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because it finally picked up on the last 70 pages or so and more happened in those pages than the rest of the book. Although, I still feel baffled and the mystery has gotten old. The characters, well, they're an add to the story. I love Mihno, Newt and Thomas, when he is not complaining. I love their conversations and I really laugh with them and their Glader words. The Betrayal plot might appeal to you, the author managed to pull that off nicely and managed to distance two characters, completely. The ending? Confusing as hell. I mean alright, I love me some tight cliffhanger but this one was a bit too baffling for me to handle. Why does Mr. Dashner want to perplex the storyline even more? I want to get down to the core of it and I want to finally find out what it is they're doing all those things for. ...more I'm more confused than ever!!! Okay first Mockingjay and now this? What is going on? I honestly can't even put into words what I felt so lacking in this installment, but I just felt so bored the entire time. Where the first book was so insanely mysterious and really baited you along in finding out what was going on, I feel like I don't want to know what's going on anymore.

What seems to be really going on is getting SO annoying. WICKED is evil. But then they save Thomas. But then they get his girlfriend to curb stomp his head in. Then they save them in the end. Then they betray them again. EXACTLY like the ending of book one. It just felt so repetitive by the end, and Thomas's endless \"Oh Teresa I love you, wait I hate you, wait where's Brenda I miss her\" became grating on my nerves. I don't even feel like overlaying the plot. It gives away way too much way too soon, you know exactly where they are and where they need to go very early on, losing that first book mystery and charm within 100 pages. I wanted to love this. You guys know that The Maze Runner holds a special place in my dystopian heart. I just.. can't. It evolves on the overall mystery, but I just feel that there isn't much to find out anymore. We know Thomas and Teresa helped WICKED out. They want to know why. Um.. because they're trying to save the world? Isn't that obvious? Yeah the methods are unorthodox, I just wanted to kinda yell at the characters sometimes at how idiotic they sounded. And there's just not enough answers (that I also feel may NEVER get answered, for some reason). Like what the hell were those metal balls that decapitated people? Or that room that Teresa threw Tom in in that cave that gassed him to health? Or those creatures lacking mouths, eyes, ears and any orifices, but with glowing orange bulbs all over their body? I almost feel like I want answers less to the big questions, but more to these really really odd occurrences. And then there's the new Group B of girls that we learn have to kill Thomas. But change their mind. And a new kid Aris (who was with Group B in their Maze) seems to be touchy-touchy with Teresa. But turns out they really... aren't. I think. And Thomas and the Gladers group up with Brenda and Jorge, Cranks they met in a huge old city and who help them along. But Brenda turns out to be a mind reader/talker person, too. So that means I can't trust her anymore? I... guess. TO MUCH, man. It bordered on contradictory most of the time and hit frustrating all the time. Let's hope The Death Cure helps me fall back in love with the series. I have this hunch that they're gonna throw them back in the Maze. Or a new Maze. I dunno. It's probably me just wanting to go back there, it was so brilliantly realized and it's own character. The Scorch, on the other hand, besides creepy lightning storms... *yawn* ...more I was expecting things to finally clear up at the end of this book, instead I was left with even more questions than before... Up until 80% I really enjoyed the story though, and I'll probably read book 3 as well, because I just have to know how all of this is going to play out. 3.5 Stars. Here we go again! Just when they think they are all safe and in a place where there is food and water and showers and bed... nope, doesn't last very long. They wake up from their little safe place to all kinds of weirdness, dead people hanging from the ceiling, cranks (crazy sick people) trying to get in the windows, Teresa gone and replaced by a boy named Aris, and other stuff. THEN, they get locked in a room and when they are allowed out all of that stuff is gone and things are changed. Then a Here we go again!

Then after a rest and what not, some dude sitting at a desk behind a glass wall shows up. He's just reading like nothing is going on while the boys gorge themselves on food. I mean what the..... Then he starts telling them about the next trial, like the first one wasn't enough. EXCERPT \"It's simple, really,\" he said, his tone so matter-of-fact one would think he'd just given them instructions on how to turn on the showers in the bathroom. \"There are no guidelines. You have few supplies, and there's nothing to help you along the way. Go through the Flat Trans at the time indicated. Find open air. Go one hundred miles, directly north, to the safe haven. Make it or die.\" And some do die. They have to go through more crap like metal balls taking off their heads, freak lightening storms, crazy people with their noses cut off, people trying to kill them, a few more monsters. You know, the run of the mill kind of stuff. I don't know. I sat here trying to figure out what to rate it and I finally went with 4 stars because I still love most of the characters. Minho is my favorite. I just want to find out what is going on and I guess I will have to wait until the end book. Arggggg.. although WICKED did show up a few times in the book, but they are still secretive and I want to smack them! MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List ...more re-reading this book was tHE BEST DECISION!! I read this book for the first time a couple of years ago and I honestly could barely remember anything that happens... So when the trailer came out and it looked amazing I felt a re-read was needed! This book was so fast paced and I just couldn't put it down!! Nearly every little chapter ends in a cliff hanger so I found myself saying \"just one more chapter\" at the end of every chapter...

The bromance and sass between the gladers in what stood out to me because it's just so great and I feel like the maze runner movie didn't quite grasp it. The twists in the story get my every time and I really don't know how to feel! James Dashner literally keeps you gripped until the very last page where I was wishing for more pages! At times I was actually quite scared when reading this because the cranks really creep me out!! The description and action sequences are really well written, making it easier to follow and understand. I am sO EXCITED for the movie now!! And if any of you are thinking \"I might re-read it before the movie comes out\" then I recommend you do it because I assure you that you'll not regret it!! ...more OH SHIT, IT LOOKS AMAZING.

With new characters and all your favorite crazed-lingo-Gladers, comes a story of constant struggle to survive, a once again, Trial that are even more terrifying, dangerous and insane as The Maze. The Scorch is a hot mess of deadly obstacles that are created by the (seemingly good) WICKED (World In Catastrophe Killzone Experiment Department) and set up to test the survived Gladers. Test what, you might ask? Can't tell ya, since even the smallest detail will give away the entire reasoning behind this mind boggling book. There is so much that happens and there is so much I wish I could say, but I will say that all your questions will be answered from the first one, but be warned, by the time you reach the last page, your mind will be spinning all over again. JAMES! Your.Killing.Me! Even though I loved this book to pieces, I still loved the first one more, but I think it was because it was so new and brilliant that I was completely blown way. The story is chalked filled with suspense and wonder. I was completely baffled the entire time I was reading this. No skimming-room for this one guys, your going to want to hang on every word. I never knew who to trust, who was good, who was bad, I thought I figured out something only for that idea to be shoot down the next chapter after. The illusion of safety is repeatedly yanked and I found myself frustrated in the best way possible. I can't count how many time I hated this one character and then wanted to believe in-said character in the same breath. It's complex and maddening, and amazing and I just want to crawl in James mind and go exploring for a few hours, or weeks. I can go on forever bouncing about this book, but if I don't stop now I'll just end up spoiling something and then I'll get things thrown at me and I have a standard no-throwing-policy, so I'll just quit while I'm a head. This book was awesome and I'm once again floored by the concept, these characters and the mastermind who pulled it all together. Loved it! Can't get enough! I want more and I can't freaken believe we have to wait a YEAR to find out what the hell is gonna happen next Killing me James, Killing me! Just Shuck it and read this now!! ...more Post-apocalyptic Nightmare!

Wow, The Scorch Trials was definitely a bizarre mind trip, and after everything that was revealed and unfolded, I can\u2019t wait to see how this series ends. This next installment to The Maze Runner picks up right where the first book left off. The Gladers have been rescued from The Maze, but their trials are far from over. They are immediately launched into a human nightmare where WICKED uses mental, physical, psychological and emotional experiments to test mind patterns and reactions\u2026 for what purpose?? I have no clue yet, but they keep saying their findings will determine the fate of humanity. For pretty much the entire novel you have no idea why The Gladers are being put through these trials as they fight biotech armies, harsh weather conditions, and constant mental games. Thomas and his crew are injected with \u201cThe Flare\u201d and promised a cure if they make it through the Trials. Along the way, they come across crazy, infected Cranks and several twists that leaves you wondering who the \u201cwicked\u201d ones really are. James Dashner is a creative genius. I can\u2019t tell you how amazed I am with his ability to come up with the most bizarre of elements that keep me, the reader, constantly wondering where he intends to take the story and what other crazy twists he can come up with. This story felt like a perfect blend between dystopic and scifi, which have recently become a favorite genre of mine. There were some harsh lessons in this story and all I have to say is betrayal is a tough pill to swallow . It was hard to see some of the decisions and actions certain characters had to take, but it was well balanced with some interesting new additions to the cast. The entire time, I kept thinking how utterly scary it is that someone of power can easily manipulate and swipe someone\u2019s memory, influence their thinking and determine their fate. This series really pushes the boundaries of possibilities and power. Two elements that when combined with ill intent can have the gravest of outcomes. I\u2019m looking forward to diving into the last book in the series The Death Cure to see how this all plays out. Well done! ...more The Scorch Trials This was an awesome books, however not as good as the first.

This book is clearly betting everything to the last book. Las trilog\u00edas son complicadas. Y dif\u00edciles. Muy poca gente sabe escribirlas bien en su totalidad, es muy f\u00e1cil caer en el cl\u00e1sico libro intermedio-de-relleno. Y no tengo problema con un libro que sea relleno, siempre y cuando ese relleno sea interesante e importante. Creo que el ejemplo por excelencia es: LAS DOS TORRES de Tolkien. aunque el escribi\u00f3 LOTR como un libro grande y la editorial lo dividi\u00f3 en tres pero me estoy saliendo del tema . Prueba de Fuego cae en ese hoyo. No se siente que tenga un objetivo real como parte de una trilog\u00eda m\u00e1s que como un libro independiente. Y la raz\u00f3n es muy sencilla: Esta trilog\u00eda no tiene una trama central. Se siente mas como un libro de aventura donde vas cambiando de escenario y \u201chaber que pasa\u201d. Tampoco tenemos mucho world-building, que seria lo principal en un libro de transici\u00f3n. El libro es r\u00e1pido de leer, y muy entretenido. Pero ya no me gusta decir que un libro es bueno por ser \u201centretenido\u201d, eso me hace recordar Transformers y Divergente. Entretener debe ser un detalle bueno no una caracter\u00edstica principal, a mi parecer. Por otro lado, me gusta mucho la interacci\u00f3n Thomas-Newt-Minho los di\u00e1logos entre ellos se ven como los de amigos normales, que se echan tierra cuando hay que hacerlo, se r\u00eden, se enojan, pero al final son amigos y se apoyan, de lejos es lo mejor del libro. Agregando que puede a tener secuencias de suspenso juvenil muy buenas y es uno de los mas grandes logros del autor. Dashner se centra m\u00e1s en las reacciones de sus personajes ante circunstancias dif\u00edciles, y eso esta bien expuesto durante el libro. La habilidad de dejar todo de lado para seguir adelante. Y los nuevos personajes me gustaron mucho , sobretodo Brenda y Harriet . Tambi\u00e9n tenemos cierta informaci\u00f3n extra sobre la situaci\u00f3n actual del mundo, pero te deja con mas preguntas que respuestas, justo cuando te esta contando algo importante, algo explota o sucede y la conversaci\u00f3n se olvida. No me gusta la situaci\u00f3n Teresa-Thomas. No me gustan, siento que no encajan sus personalidades, ella es muy seca y el demasiado mandilon. Y definitivamente es lo que me hace bajarle media estrella. De no ser por este peque\u00f1o detalle le dar\u00eda las 4 enteras. Al final, la trilog\u00eda en general no intenta m\u00e1s que ser una historia interesante de suspenso y acci\u00f3n juvenil, y siento que esta bien logrado. Desgraciadamente se desperdicia mucho espacio en escenas de acci\u00f3n y se deja de lado la exploraci\u00f3n de la tierra devastada que era mucho m\u00e1s interesante. A mi los tres chicos principales me gustan mucho, sobretodo Newt, y eso hace que le siga teniendo cari\u00f1o a la historia :D Si lo que quieres es un libro sin mucho desarrollo pero entretenido y con personajes variados y bien expuestos, creo que The Maze Runner es una buena opci\u00f3n. Si buscas algo con muchas respuestas, no lo encontraras aqu\u00ed. No olvidemos que estos chicos est\u00e1n en un mundo enorme con una situaci\u00f3n ya planteada, sin memoria, con gente loca por todos lados y con muchas ganas de no morir. No seria muy l\u00f3gico que alguien se sentara a explicarles todo. Y claramente esa no es la intenci\u00f3n del autor. Para Dashner, cuando el caos viene es mas posible que la gente se organice y agrupe para sobrevivir, el cree mas en ese aspecto del hombre y eso es lo que expone. PEL\u00cdCULA: La he disfrutado mucho. Es claramente una adaptaci\u00f3n bastante regular, pero los cambios eran necesarios para hacer una pel\u00edcula mas madura, a mi parecer. Y no me molesto nada. Ademas casi pasa lo mismo pero el camino para llegar a eso es lo distinto. Mas unas cuantas subtramas sacadas de la manga, claro. Me gusta mucho la actuaci\u00f3n para los tres principales (Thomas, Newt y Minho), y la adici\u00f3n de Brenda fue lo mejor! Las escenas de acci\u00f3n excelentes y la historia mas interesante que en los libros. Ups. Le doy 4/5. ...more Wow...just wow...This book left me both exhilarated and exhausted.

However, if you have not read the first book you might want to stop reading this review and go read the first book of the series first. This will be here when you get back. So this book picks up right where the first book ends. Thomas wakes up to screaming and terror and things change and are being flipped around on him every few minutes. Chaos reigns! Even my head was spinning trying to rationalize what is going on. They think they are rescued but the truth is anything but. If you thought they were lab rats in the Maze before, it only gets worse. I really can't say much on the details without taking away from the suspense of it all. Everything changes here. Friends and enemies blur, the truth is unknown. All they know is that WICKED is not done with them. One part stuck with me through the entire book and that is when the boys are told to not trust what they see but to also not trust what the don't see. As a reader it had me second guessing a lot. Made for a very entertaining read. What I didn't care for is I have no idea where the author is going with this. So many questions and NO answers. Just more questions. It worries me if the answer in the last book will suffice. Will in make sense. These trials are strange and don't seem to make sense for supposedly trying to save the world.So that concerns me all throughout the book. A large part of the story seemed to be created o a whim without flow. It makes me wonder if the writer had an endgame when writing this or just making it up as he went along. I guess I will find out in the third book.For lots of action, adventure and some serious twists and mental roller coaster rides, check this out! I am very eager to read the third book right now! ...more After two books, I'd like some answers, but I'm not sure I'm going to continue the series. There were so many games within games. Our hero vows not to play any more games, but (given that he is not really in control and doesn't know who to trust) that's not really possible. So he will continue to be betrayed (or not).

While there were some things I liked about the book and some of the new characters which were introduced in this book, at times I think I was as frustrated as Thomas. ...more The thrill, suspense and excitement of the events in the Maze Runner turned several notches down in this book. But it is in this sequel that the readers learn the world outside of the maze- a world that is just as terrifying or even worse than that of the maze. New characters, twists in plots and character roles take place that give a new take on the story. If you have been following me, then you know I've been rereading books . Most of them have been big fails, and one or two have approved, but this is not the point in here. What I mean to say is that I read this book as part of that experiment of mine AND for another reason too. Can you guess what's the second reason ? Yeah, it's the movie. To be honest, I hated the first one: It was boring, VERY different to the book (and I didn't particularly love that one), etc. BUT, I can never resist it.

What I mean to say is that I read this book as part of that experiment of mine AND for another reason too. Can you guess what's the second reason ? Yeah, it's the movie. To be honest, I hated the first one: It was boring, VERY different to the book (and I didn't particularly love that one), etc. BUT, I can never resist it. When there's a movie coming for a book I have read (even if there's still a long time to wait), I get excited. I get excited even if I disliked the book. Anyway, that's just why I read the book. Now, what do I have to say? 1. Where, oh where did all the emotion from the first book go? I said in my review for The Maze Runner that it was predictable and boring at some times, but I can't deny there was sometimes a feel of thrill - adrenaline, if you want it like that. In this one... NOTHING HAPPENED! We get this rubbish about WHY ARE WE HERE? WHY IS TERESA GONE? WHAT IS GROUP B? OH MY GOD, WHAT IS HAPPENING?!? Ugh, no. I guess this book is just another victim of the middle book syndrome, in which it's just a pointless waste of paper (and money). 2. Characters... again. Oh, noes, Thomas, you again with your Gary Stu-ish personality, but now it gets even worse. Why? Because we have love interest #2 introduced and she is... Brenda! She has no personality, she's boring and annoying. Worse even, she's just... there. Her role in the book is... nothing. I mean, nothing besides being the second option for Thomas. Plus, she sounded EXACTLY like Teresa, so aside being a pointless character, she was a carbon copy of another boring character. Also, Jorge. What the hell? Was it just me or did he also sound like Minho? And how about Aris? He was like another Thomas! But Thomas wins the medal for the most annoying character in this book. 3. Stop with the useless plot twists. Seriously, though, this book was even more plagued of plot twists to which an explanation was never given. Add to that plot holes. Why do you mention something you are not going to deepen? And I'm talking about the plague. We get a very little explanation as to what it is, but we never know how it appeared, how it is spread, etc. All we know is that it's deadly and contagious. That's all. This get me to the world building, which gets ZERO points. There are NO EXPLANATIONS for ANYTHING. First that plague I was talking about, then about the society itself, then about W.I.C.K.E.D (seriously, that acronym is ridiculous). They never explain how the society came to be how it is, and that aspect is CRUCIAL for a dystopian book. 4. The ending was really wtf and ridiculous. I laughed at it. Why? Because cliched. That's my answer. Besides, it was anticlimactic and (again) precipitated. Why can't you take your time into ending the book without rushing? It feels forced and it just kills whatever emotion (that was not present in me, btw) the reader had up until that point. And also, it felt as if the author didn't know what else to add so TELEPATHY WOO-HOO! So yeah, in summary, this was boring, cliched, pointless and laughable. My verdict? Damn you Vane for starting the 2015 rereads. ...more I like The Maze Runner even I only have a very little idea of what is really happening underneath or behind this Maze-thing. I appreciated it's intensity and suspense, even the characters, so it's fine to me that I didn't get answers in the first place. In The Scorch Trials, I had enough. Yes, I've been informed about the idea that everything is an experiment and there is a virus called Flare that needs a cure.

Yes, I've been informed about the idea that everything is an experiment and there is a virus called Flare that needs a cure. But when I thought about it, I found the events (the experiment-thingy) happened in this book were kinda non-sense and ridiculous. Okay, maybe it's not non-sense and ridiculous but I am too tired in waiting to find what the fuck this is all about. Talk about concrete plot. In other books I've read, it is clear or I have the idea, at least, where the plot is going yet in this book I don't know. I have the idea but it's very, very unclear. The plot or the missing link-I-need is sealed enough and locked that it can't wiggle its way out. It felt like it's a trick so I'll definitely read the third book and finally can get my answers. I can't blame the authors but it will be nice if he spilled some information, solid ones, about this virus and experiment going on. He had just thrown little information, some random stuff and deus ex machinas to make the story alive or compelling but for me it's really trying-hard. I still gave it 2 stars because I'm generous lol. I like the first part to be honest. And after that, I was neutral until the end. The old characters underwent no character development. And the newly-introduced characters were not so interesting, in my opinion. They fell flat for my taste. I don't care if Thomas, Newt, Minho, Teresa and others will die or will be killed. The only character I'm rooting for is long gone. *cries* Bonus: I am really annoyed with the fact that Thomas got a lot of sleep in this book than me in real life. Seriously, almost in every end of the chapter he dozed off, fell into a sleep, took a nap, passed out and whatnot. What the fuck. Don't you have any options on how to end a chapter? To end this, maybe I just didn't get it at all or maybe I just didn't get the answers I need. So done. But I'll still read the next one. ...more", "Title": "The Scorch Trials"},
