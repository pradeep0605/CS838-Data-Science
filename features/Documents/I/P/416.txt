I have been waiting to read Fade since I sped through the last few pages of Wake, and I was not disappointed. Everything that I attracted me to the first novel is still there, simplicity of McMann\u2019s writing, quick pace and realistic dialogue. Fade divulges more about Janie\u2019s ability which was fascinating and unimaginable at the same time. The unique relationship between Janie and Cabel is also taken to a new level. I usually don\u2019t comment on the content within a novel, but I know there were a few comments on my review of Wake that said they had a problem with the language. So yes, there are cuss words in this book, and if that is going to bother you, keep in mind this novel is about catching a sexual predator. ...more How sad and moving is this book? I loved it so much more than its predecessor and the worst thing about is that I am refusing to read the conclusion to the trilogy: Gone . I feel that the stage I am at seems to need some kind of conclusion and I desperately want to read more but, on the other hand, I refuse to ruin a story that has so far held me captivated by its depth of emotion and well-built mysteries with an ending that is mediocre.

And I have read enough reviews by trusted goodreads friends to know this ending will not be the one I wanted. But it's more than that, sometimes it takes a very brave author to create an ending that will upset the readers... I could just about handle a change in where it seems the story is headed, but what I can't and won't accept is a poorly written and dragging end (<---B>which I've read is all that can be expected here</---B>). I don't want to put you off starting this series; in fact, the reason I'm not reading on is because of how much I liked Wake and Fade .<---F> This book was particularly good</---F>. Janie and Cabe's relationship is so sweet and touching that you can't help but be caught up in their romance regardless of whether or not you're usually a fan of romances. There's something about the story of two outsiders who find comfort in one another that gets me every time (it did the same in Numbers ) and I found myself blinking back tears during parts of the novel. It's also about far more than just the difficulties of finding love when you have a weird, supernatural ability. Fade has a very dark and sometimes scary mystery story going on as well. Janie is sent to investigate the case of a sexual predator amongst the teaching staff at her high school. It leads to some very frightening and creepy scenes with drugs and attempted rapes... plus, the whole scene towards the end of the party had me completely on edge and made my skin crawl. This book is truly fantastic and I would recommend it to everyone. I'd also like to point out that I nearly gave up on the series in Wake because the 3rd person present tense reads like stage directions and it was driving me crazy, but trust me and stick with it - it's more than worth it in the end. ...more Second reading of \"Fade\" confirmed that this second book is the best in the series. Not only does it develop marvelously the relationship between Janie and Cabel (which was a central theme of \"Wake\"), but it also brings in an excellent mystery story line.

Janie Hannagan returns, this time using her abilities of being swept into a person's dreams to solve a sex scandal at her school. Several calls have been made on Fieldridge High School's anonymous phone line. Although inaudible at times, the messages result in the assumption that certain faculty members and students at Fieldridge have been fooling around. So Captain and her agents use their closest resources to try and crack the case, meaning Janie and Cabel will have to figure out what is going on. Objection at first by Cabel, but Janie gives the final decision and both are on the case. While the investigation continues, Janie is given the chance to finally see what lies ahead for her. Hardly given any information about her ability, Captain gives Janie a box full of papers written by Martha Stubin that not only contains her secrets and past, but the positive and negative effects of helping others with their dreams. Although she may have a clue with what these effects are, Janie isn't so sure she is ready to confirm what she already knows. With the intensity of the case and her outcome, Cabel isn't so sure he can handle the danger that Janie puts herself in, and their relationship begins to weaken. Will they be able to get through this case peacefully or will it tear them apart? As a highly anticipated sequel to WAKE, FADE certainly lives up to expectations. Along with Janie, readers will be able to delve deeper into the enormity of Janie's ability and the strain that it causes not only on her but also on Cabel. The simplicity of the writing and the creativity of the plot will leave an imprint of the reader, causing it to never FADE from their mind. ...more \"Fade\" continues the story begun in \"Wake\" and if you try reading this one first, you're likely to be a little confused. In \"Wake,\" we met Janie, a girl with the ability to be a dream-catcher. This means she can enter other people's dreams. \"Wake\" was about Janie coming to terms with her new power. \"Fade\" is concerned with Janie learning the responsible use of her power and the consequences of being a dream-catcher.

It sets up things for a third and final installment of the series that, quite frankly, can't come soon enough for my liking. Also in \"Fade\" we find Janie working undercover to find a sexual predator at her high school. Janie's work, and the toll is takes on her new-found relationship with fellow undercover informant Caleb, drive much of the narrative of the story. As with \"Wake,\" McCann writes in short sentences that help power the story forward. The novel has a dreamlike quality to it that helps draw in the reader and really allows us to experience from Janie's persepctive. While the story is told in the third-person, the narrative focus never shifts from Janie. That helps the reader identity with the joys, fears and frustration Janie feels as the novel unfolds. ...more Like with the first book of this series, I read Fade in a matter of hours. Fade is the second book in <---A>Lisa McMann</---A>'s Wake Trilogy and just as good as the first one. In Fade, Janie learns more about her dream catching abilities. She works with the cops, undercover, with her boyfriend Cabel. In the last book, they work together to bust a drug dealer, but in this novel, Captain wants their help in busting a sexual predator in their school. Using Janie as bait. Let's just say that Cabel does not appro Like with the first book of this series, I read Fade in a matter of hours.

She works with the cops, undercover, with her boyfriend Cabel. In the last book, they work together to bust a drug dealer, but in this novel, Captain wants their help in busting a sexual predator in their school. Using Janie as bait. Let's just say that Cabel does not approve of Janie's decision to act as the bait. In the end, they discover that her Chem 2, Psychology, and PE teachers are all sexual predators and Captain has them arrested. However, in the glory of the bust, Cabe and Janie go through a rough patch. In the end, though, they work it out and decide to go through their problems as they come. Again, I loved Cabel's character. I understood his apprehension about Janie's situation, not only because it was a dangerous one, but because of all the loss he has faced in his life. He was, at times, overprotective of her, but that was, again, understandable. I didn't appreciate him practically bolting after they busted the teachers, but I was glad when he finally talked to her about what was doing with him. Despite that, though, I couldn't get over how much of a cutie he was and how much I loved him still. Janie was an even more interesting character in this book. She has developed since her time in Wake. I was interested in learning more about her powers and was glad when she finally read that green notebook. It seemed like she was constantly yelling at Cabe in this book, though, and I didn't really appreciate that. When they worked out their stuff, though, at the end, I was glad she stood up to him and demanded to know why he was pushing her away. I hated when Janie had the GHB in here. That was the worst part for me because of everything that happened with the teachers when she was under the influence of the date-rape drug. One thing that was particularly satisfying: Janie and Cabel finally had sex. I was glad they finally did The Deed because, both in Wake and Fade, there was allll kinds of pent up sexual tension that needed to be taken care of and let out. Again, I lovelovelove this book and eagerly await the time when I get my hands on Gone, the third book in the trilogy, even though I'll be very sad to see the trilogy end. ...more I'm reviewing this one after reading the whole trilogy. There won't be any spoilers but that fact shapes the way I see this book, making me like it more. This trilogy is short, very short. I'm sure that the word count of the three books added together barely exceeds that of most average length novels. So it's easier for me to think of this trilogy as just one book with three parts.

Fade reads like all second parts do in this kind of books\u2014you already have the events and players set up in part one, now it's time to get down to business. The case they're working on is far more interesting and involved that the one in Wake. Also, the strain it puts on Janie and Cabel's relationship seems less contrived than in Wake\u2014there's actual danger this time\u2014and seeing them work through those issues without much of the usual angst\u2014there is some but this is YA after all\u2014or stooping to the use of clich\u00e9s such as the overused loveless love triangle was refreshing. One of the things that I liked most about the story was the way Janie handled herself regarding the case. The author uses her to analyze the ways and tricks of sexual predators with a remarkable clarity without making the common mistake of overdoing it by making the character preachy or prude or just stupidly na\u00efve. Oh, one last thing. I don't exactly know why but I enjoyed the timetable format much more this time around. I'm sure that, in part, it's because I got used to it but I think it has more to do with a sense of urgency throughout the whole book that just wasn't there for me in Wake. The ending would work equally well for closing the whole story instead of just this book. Reading Gone after this is not only unnecessary but also a bit anticlimactic. I'd still tell you to go for it, just be warned that it's more a long epilogue than a book on its own right. ...more Okay, so I liked this one a tad more than I liked Wake . But only because it actually had some semblance of a plot and the writing was a bit tighter. If only the plot wasn\u2019t so fucking ridiculous and outlandish.

And there was no suspense. McMann really needs to learn how to employ a red-herring every now and again. It got to the point where I thought the actual bad guy was the red-herring just because it was so boringly and straight-forwardly him. And Janie and Cabel need to take a chill pill. My God, you would think with all their responsibilities they would be a little less moody. Well, at least there isn\u2019t a love triangle. I am not exactly looking forward to the final one. ...more Lisa McMann blew me away with this second book. I was uncontrollably gripping the book till the last word.

She comes to make some tough choices and I see her as such a strong character, a true heroine. To go through what she goes through and yet she comes out wanting an even better future . I admire her. What I do have to say about the writing-- even though some outcomes and actions pan out in a predictable manner I am still completely engrossed in Janie's experience of it and her emotional attachment to the people, places, and events that I overlook the fact that I know what happens next. (I will talk more about this Thursday, if you're interested in knowing what I'm talking about.) The book is darker, more angst filled But in the end, I was relieved. Somewhat. I want to know how it ends. I hope to God it has a happy ending. I want them to. After all the struggles and tribulation they went through, it needs to happen. ...more This sequel to McMann's young adult novel \"Wake\" improves on the former with more focused prose and more attention given to the budding romance between \"dream catcher\" Janie and her narc-in-hiding boyfriend, Cabel.

If there's a third wheel to this relationship, it's the couple's employer, Police Captain Fran Komisky, who serves on occasion as surrogate parental figure and relationship counselor, providing all the well intentioned tough-love you can stand. The plot itself is fairly uncomplicated but, as with many police novels, only half the enjoyment comes from solving a crime; most readers stick with a series to follow the progress (or decline) of the central characters, and again this is where McMann's novel excels. It has an interesting premise, with sympathetic (if typically dysfunctional) central characters, and the stories are set cleverly amid the emotional turbulence and self-discovery of adolescence. If there's anything to wish for with this new series, it would be to expand the net of experiences and characters. The life and crimes of Fieldridge High are entertaining, but McMann has created a cast that could easily swim in larger seas, and, while they're out there, go up against some better sharks. ...more A lot of my criticisms of the book Wake, remain for its sequel. \u00a0You can read my Wake review here .

The Plot Like the previous book, the plot is really simplistic and nothing real original. \u00a0It's fairly easy to see where things are going with the investigation our two heroes are involved in and the execution wasn't too mind-blowing. \u00a0The scene at the party (don't want to give too much away) was really well done and I was on pins and needles. \u00a0I've been slipped a date rape drug before (thank God my future husband and best friend were with me and saved me) and the descriptions of what Janie suffers were spot on. The part of the story I enjoyed the most was Janie discovering more about her powers and the ill-effects of her ability to enter other people's dreams. \u00a0Janie's life is not a very happy one. \u00a0Her mother has obviously abandoned her for the bottle, leaving her to her own devices, and Janie has high-aspirations for herself. What she discovers is truly terrifying because it could alter her life and world forever. The Characters The relationship between Janie and Caleb was very realistic, if not annoying at times. They are very broken people and only teenagers. \u00a0They both make huge mistakes, but it felt very real. Janie definitely matures in this book while Caleb suffers a setback. \u00a0That unevenness between them is the cause of a lot of their troubles, but they are a couple I can believe in and root for. Overall A solid continuation of the first story, yet it was not as intense as the first. A lot of the discoveries in the story take place at the very end leaving a lot of time where not a lot really happens. \u00a0Yet, I'm still on board for the third and final book in the trilogy. ...more You should read WAKE before you pick up FADE.

Unlike every other book blogger, I didn't love these books and I wanted to make sure I could express why. Wake has an interesting premise, but it seems like all the dreams Janie falls into are sex dreams or nightmares that are memories. I thought this was an easy way out.

It seemed too easy how the dreams were related to real life-where was the dream interpretation? The hiding spot for a drug bust is revealed in a dream?? That all seemed a little too easy. I know if Janie fell into one of my dreams, it wouldn't make any sense-so why do all these dreams seem to have some sort of answer to a puzzle? I also wasn't a fan of the writing style. It was choppy, which yes, I understand is a way of expressing to the reader Janie's life, how it's stop and start and how tired the dream jumping makes Janie. Plus, I didn't like how I was told constantly \"Janie sprints through the snowy yards..\", \"Janie is curious.\" \"Janie wishes..\" \"Janie's vision returns slowly.\" It just seemed overdone and personally, I found it annoying. As far as the dream-jumping/catching thing, nothing was really explained in Wake which really frustrated me. I felt it took a long time (after 100 pages in a 224 page book!) to really get the story going. Wake felt like I was watching a pilot of a TV show-the characters are still shaky, the acting isn't that great yet, the chemistry is still being learned-it was good, but its main job was to set up what could be great. Now on to Fade. I liked this one better. It was longer, the story had more time to develop, and more was explained. Again, I found the mystery too easy and kind of silly and the whole side job thing that Janie and Cabel have going is just really corny to me. I like the relationship between Janie and Cabel and thought it was much better than the first one. Janie was such a strong character but then halfway through she was a whimpering girl who couldn't live without Cabel-it seemed somewhat out of character for her. At least in Fade she stays strong throughout, even if their relationship has a lot of communication problems. There were many times I wanted to yell at them for being so stupid and just talk to each other! With all that said, don't think I didn't like these books. I did, I just didn't love them. The story was enough to keep me interested and keep reading-I was interested enough to finish both in one sitting each. I'm interested to see what happens next and I'm intrigued by Janie's dream catching, I just wish the mystery/crime solving aspect wasn't so easy. I think Lisa McMann is a talented writer, I'm just not a big fan of the style she's using in these books. Maybe I'm just not the right target audience since I'm not a teenager anymore. I would recommend these books and I think they'd be great for reluctant readers. I'll be reading the next one, but they're not going on my list of all time favorites. (One last thing-my side tangent. I don't know why but I find it really obnoxious when characters who don't really know each other all that well or have hardly talked suddenly have a nickname for each other. Janie hardly had talked to Cabel and then suddenly on a school trip she calls him Cabe. This grates on my nerves-maybe because my name is too short to have a nickname so I'm jealous of these book characters? I don't know. Unrelated, but I also hated it in Breaking Dawn, when suddenly Rosalie, who had never really been a friend to Bella, was now Rose. UGH!) ...more This was my review of Wake (to which Fade is a sequel): \"In some ways, this book reads like it was written by a very, very smart teenager on the older/more mature side, i.e. 17-18, has been in love, and experienced other kinds of deep vulnerability as well--basically like the book's heroine, perhaps in a few years or in a self-reflexive place.

The same goes for this book as well, which goes into even deeper and darker corners and crannies in the \"main\" plotline while also developing the beautiful--but never easy--relationship between the two leads, both of whom have been deeply hurt (but believe themselves \"damaged,\" not necessarily the same thing). ...more Kitab\u0131 sevdim ilkide g\u00fczeldi zaten.de\u011fi\u015fikti,farkl\u0131yd\u0131,tuhaft\u0131.

In Fade we see the action and suspense pick up a little more as Cabel and Jennie track down a sexual predator. The relationship between these two misfits is one of the sweetest I've ever read. I don't think I'll be able to bring myself to read Gone considering how many are so completely unsatisfied with it, but as it is, Wake and Fade are brilliant. I may or may not have finished the last 100 pages of this book with a torch light in the middle of the night. That\u2019s a big enough of a clue to tell you how much I enjoyed this book. It blows my mind how Lisa McMann managed to write two amazing books for the same series, while I\u2019m sitting here, staring at both the books figuring out which I liked better.

Cabe spends most of this book sulking, which is just plain - boring, unoriginal, etc. Take your pick. My biggest problem however, was the absolutely stupid central crime mystery. I understand that this is a paranormal book, and with that comes some understanding that you will just have to believe the weird out of ordinary things that happen. I don't have a problem with that, especially when it concerns the paranormal aspects of the book itself. What was cringe worthy here was the ridiculous hunt for the child predator working as a teacher in the high school. So you mean to tell me that the local police department puts two teenage kids (both of who have been through emotionally traumatizing experiences recently) undercover to catch date rapists masquerading as teachers? Nevermind the kids are dating and let's just ignore any complications that might arise as a result of that. There was one scene where she is getting ready to go a party to try to finally identify the bad guy (who happens to be supplying students with GHB and then raping them) and the Captain tells her to read up on date rape drugs. No training, no information, just go get on Google and you're good!! WTF? It gets better. Despite the fact that she's under the influence of GHB (she missed the part on google about how you can put GHB in things other than drinks - don't eat the food!) she manages to fight off not one, but two would be attackers!! Two of them!! At that point I couldn't stop rolling my eyes. I'm really on the fence on whether to read the third one. ...more Lisa McMann's Fade picks up right where Wake left off.

This naturally upsets her boyfriend Cabel, precipitating an ongoing tension between them that lasts for the rest of the book, uncovering a number of other insecurities along the way. Cabel and Janie's relationship development remains riveting and there are a couple of steamy, though non-graphic sex scenes, that will have readers clamoring for more. On the whole, however, I felt that Ms. McMann dropped the ball a bit in this sequel. Though Wake had research issues of its own, Fade felt even less realistic in many instances. Indeed the portrayal of the case that Janie and Cabel are investigating seemed highly unlikely to me, as did the way in which Janie used dreams to sleuth out details of the crime that would never actually be present in a dream. It seemed almost as though McMann had thought to herself, \"Well, I've done drugs, what next? A sex predator ring of course!\" It just didn't ring true to me, and she didn't include any authentic sounding details to make the bizarrely melodramatic plot more believable. There are also some pretty glaring plot holes and flaws in motivations, and a couple of instance where things that were really built up had anti-climactic resolutions. McMann clearly had a vision of where she wanted her (vaguely ridiculous) plot to go, and didn't let trifles like realism and believability get in her way. Don't get me wrong, it was still a lot of fun to read, and I finished it in about 2 or 3 hours, but the substance really just wasn't there on this one. Read it for the romance, but don't expect much from the plot. Hopefully we'll see a return to believability in McMann's next book, Gone. ...more I'm giving this 2 stars because it was less boring than the first, but still a weak book :( .

Now the Capt. has a new assignment for them. Someone called in anonymously to the student hotline and a sexual predator is suspected within the school system in the form of a teacher. Cabel and Janie are to keep their eyes and ears open to find out what's going on. And that Janie does. She also is given a box of journals from the late dream catcher, Mrs. Sumlin. She begins to read this until she finds a warning in the notebook about not reading any further unless you're ready to hear the consequences of being a dreamcatcher. I liked the part of this book where Janie and Cabel come a lot closer in teir relationship. Their characters have grown intimate and they really learn a lot about eachother and grow as a couple. The end comes as climactic when Janie finds herself at a party hosted by her chemistry teacher, who has been coming on to her pretty heavily lately. Is he the sexual predator, or are things not always as they seem?? You'll have to read the book to find out. You won't be disappointed. My only regret in reading this book is that Janie does decide to read further into the notebook and finds out the good and bad things that the life of a dreamcatcher entails. I'm hoping for a happy ending in the last book, but I\"m skeptical it's going to end the way I want it to.

I just plain have a really hard time buying that a police captain, and an apparently somewhat caring woman, would so willingly put a seriously unprepared teenager in so vulnerable and dangerous a position. Especially since all they've got to go on is two phone calls to a crime hotline, one of which is almost entirely unintelligible, the second of which is interpretable in a couple of ways, the most likely-seeming to me being completely benign. I'm all for going the extra mile when kids might possibly be in danger, even if it's only a slim hint like I feel this was, but jumping straight to putting another teenager, even a willing one, in the line of fire? I just don't buy it. It also made it a lot more difficult for me to take the story seriously as a whole, making me far more skeptical of characters I'd thought were fine before, but which now seem underdeveloped.
