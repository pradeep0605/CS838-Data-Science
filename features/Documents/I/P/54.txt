{"Comments": "Mr. Sparks, All my life I believed in order for a wonderful marriage all you needed was true love. And now, knowing that for a relationship to work it needs much more then love, reading your books is honestly quite pathetic and sad. All your books are the same, have you ever thought about writing a book that doesn't involve two people falling in love over the course of twenty-four hours? This isn't going to be a long review, but it will be a ranting one.<---F> Just going to jump right in</---F>... The characters in this book are ridiculous! First <---C>Gabby</---C>. One word- Annoying! She got on my last nerve. This is going to sound insane, but she thought way to much. The first half of this book is her just thinking... but it's about nothing at all. She just goes on and on and on about any and everything!!!! Then on top of her babbling she was obsessed with making it crystal clear that she had a boyfri This isn't going to be a long review, but it will be a ranting one. Just going to jump right in... The characters in this book are ridiculous! First Gabby. One word- Annoying! She got on my last nerve. This is going to sound insane, but she thought way to much. The first half of this book is her just thinking... but it's about nothing at all. She just goes on and on and on about any and everything!!!! Then on top of her babbling she was obsessed with making it crystal clear that she had a boyfriend. Hey having a party at my house would you like to come- I have a boyfriend. Hi how are you- I have a boyfriend... What time is it- I have a boyfriend.... What color is the sky- I have a boyfriend. WE GET IT!!!! YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND! WE GET IT,<---M> TRAVIS GETS IT</---M>, HIS FRIENDS GET IT, PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD OF THIS BOOK GET IT! Shut the F up about how you have a boyfriend! NO ONE ASKED! She's also absent minded, jumps to assumptions, and takes her anger out on everyone.... Oh wait there's more... she's needy, whiny, and way too attached to the male characters in this book. Everything she did uggggggggggh drove me insane. Then we have Travis. Travis is perfect. And yeah this is a problem. He is able to do everything, and I'm just not ok with this. Cook, clean, entertain children, ride motorcycles, you name it he does it. I like my characters with flaws and he legit has none. Oh and boy does he ooze of charm. That's another thing! HE IS TOO CHARMING!!!! Yeah, I'll give it to him, he has a few very silly cute moments. However all his perfections overshadowed all. I did prefer Travis to Gabby, but I don't really know what that says. The relationship between the two is soooooooooo unrealistic. Mr. Sparks you have your two main characters fall in love in one weekend!!!! ONE weekend! I'm not saying that this would be impossible for an author to do what I'm saying is that you are going to have to do it up... You are going to have to pull out all the stops; stops that aren't even invented yet! Good sir, when you make a book 250 pages it's a sprint not a marathon. I'm talking that can't eat-can't sleep-reach for the stars-over the fence world series kind of magic. We don't have time for you to waste on all this pointless backstory BS. Having these characters falling in love over a weekend would mean you would have to have us fall in love with them being in love in a matter of pages... Newsflash you didn't! I DID NOT FOR ONE SINGLE SECOND BELIEVE THESE TWO COULD/DID FALL IN LOVE! I gave no Fs about these two being together.... Which leads me to the plot. WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD! There really isn't much plot to talk about because nothing happens.\u00a085% of this book NOTHING happens! This book puts all its eggs in the basket that is a coma. I'm sure by now you've all seen the trailers for this movie... So you know home girl gets in an accident... Which makes it very clear that the choice will be that he has to either A) pull the plug or B) not. I wont tell you what he chooses to do, but I really don't have to. You will know! Every part of the ending is PRE-DICT-ABLE! Oh and when the big reveal happened I WAS SO PISSED! ROYALLY PISSED! I was so annoyed by how everything went that I was praying to the book gods to just have Gabby die! Live-die, Gabby gonna be real with you I just don't care!!! Actually you know what, just die, it's cool. I was told over and over again by several people that that none of this would matter. That by the end I would still be a blubbering mess...I WASN'T!!! I did not shed a single tear. I cry in almost every book but didn't in this one! I think that really says something. I was just to busy being angry to be upset. Nick Sparks needs to re-evaluate his writing. This is a story he has done time and time again. Wealthy white people fall in love, someone ends up in the hospital, but in the long run it all works out for them... because LOVE CONQURS ALL EVEN MODERN MEDICINE. Yeah its just a no! We are not on good terms Nick. F this book. I was way easier on this book than I planned on being review wise.... I toned it down, which I know in the long run I'll regret doing. Oh and If at this point you're still wondering if I'll be seeing this movie or not?!?!?!... Well you can bet your sweet buns I am. I'm actually still pretty pumped about it.

First of all Gabby is in a committed relationship and even though its not a perfect one, its not terrible and they're in love. Then she spends some time with Travis and BAMMM! she's in love with him too only after two days! What? And they had to say in like the stupidest way possible! 'i love you Travis Parker.' 'And I love you Gabby Holland.' I do not understand how that can happen in that short amount of time while she's already in love with somebody else. And she cheats on her boyfriend by sleeping with Travis ever spare minute she has for like five days. Cheating isn't romantic. Travis shouldn't marry her cause if she cheats WITH him, she would probably cheat ON him. Later in the book Gabby goes in a coma. Travis has a written document that's signed by Gabby saying if she's in a coma for more than twelve weeks with no sign of recovery whatsoever, she basically wants to be taken off life support. Then it comes to that time and you know what Travis does? HE DOESN'T EVEN TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THE PAPER. I mean it's what she WANTED and he just completely ignores it AND breaks the LAW. That just mad me so mad. And later when she wakes up (<---B>of course you have to have a perfect, unrealistic ending</---B>) she doesn't even bring it up. Not at all. She doesn't even care that he didn't follow her wishes. And a lot of the time when people wake up from long term comas, something is different about them. Like maybe their memory is a little messed up or their personality has changed. But nope Gabby is COMPLETELY back to normal?? The last thing that bothered me is that he literally went around asking people and himself 'How far will you go in the name of love?' when trying to decide if he should take Gabby off life support or not . WHO ASKS PEOPLE THAT? What does that even mean? And anyway it's not going 'in the name of love' if you break somebody's trust and wishes. Does anybody else understand what I'm getting at? ...more First of I'd just like to say I don't hate this book, nor do I love it. Nicholas Sparks has shown through his story the choice that true love no longer is valued and has no meaning. He basically conveyed that a strong attraction towards the opposite gender can be referred to as love. For instance, if I were to hang out with a single person for the entire weekend and have a strong attraction towards them because they were attractive I would not refer to it as love It can called a huge crush, or s First of I'd just like to say I don't hate this book, nor do I love it.

For instance, if I were to hang out with a single person for the entire weekend and have a strong attraction towards them because they were attractive I would not refer to it as love It can called a huge crush, or something along those lines but to love someone so quickly is supposedly impossible. Gabby herself stated that she didn't know him yet she still declared this intimate love towards him. Um, Nicholas sparks please make some sense. (view spoiler) [ Truthfully speaking,when I found out Gabby was in coma and Travis was all depressed, I did cry. Not lying at all. It's just the way the author toys with your emotions because of course true love is a delicate spot in many peoples hearts. Travis seems like the typical playboy kid when hes introduced in the story, although the way him and Gabby speak to each other is very odd. If I had to name my favorite character from the story I'd have to go with Stephanie, she's cool, straight up and is a thoroughly entertaining character. When it starts describing their relationship in comparison to the other couple who've experienced the very same thing I found it extremely ridiculous and cliche. So when Gabby was in coma and Travis was mentioned about the tear stained pillow and how the first thing he always said was i'm sorry sweetheart My heart literally broke. I continuously found myself wanting to scream Wake up Gabby, don't do this to Travis, you have to wake up You have to keep in mind that the only reason I was literally balling my eyes out was because I am a very emotional person. Either way Nicholas Sparks' stories are totally overrated, seriously. This guy needs to think of new story lines. I've noticed that all he does to his stories is a little mix and match and voila a new bestselling book because girls just love this emotional shit that really gets to them. Huh? No. (hide spoiler) ] Well anyway, I seriously say if you enjoyed Nicholas Sparks'other books, go for it. Go crazy. But if you believe all this is way too sappy for your own good put a big X over this book [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more I should preface this review by saying that The Choice was a really thoughtful Christmas gift from my little brother, Darren. I'm glad I read it, as I've been curious about the Nicholas Sparks following (at least among a certain, um, demographic). Sparks' writing style is also clear, it's an absurdly fast read, and I'd be lying if I claimed the storyline didn't occasionally leave me a bit verklempt.

Usually I rail against the media's unrealistic portrayal of women, but the male protagonist in this novel was truly beyond the pale. This man had not ONE character flaw (unless blind, unadulterated devotion to the woman he worships counts). Other issues? Love magically cures what modern medicine can't, cheeeeesy cheeeeeeeesy dialogue, and I WANTED THE FEMALE PROTAGONIST TO DIE. Seriously. There either must be something terribly wrong with me and my empathy skills, or there is something wrong with this book. I'm sorry, Nicholas Sparks fans. I do enjoy a good fluff-filled love story, and I'm a big fan of certain types of fantasy (hooray, Harry Potter). This was just too much. Maybe The Choice would make a better screenplay; I thoroughly enjoyed the cinematic Notebook, after all. ...more Pulled at my heart strings and ended up crying for about 5 mintues at the end.

I loved Travis as a character. He seemed genuinely nice and care-free. I felt that he was a guy enjoyed the pleasures of the world especially when it came to women. He wants to one day settle down but hadn't found a woman that really made him feel different when it came to love. Gabby was okay. I had a hard time liking her. I felt like she was a bit whiney. I think I understand what the author was trying to convey with this character but she bothered me. I found myself rolling my eyes a lot. When I finally saw the movie I liked movie-Gabby better than book-Gabby. The romance.... kinda bothered me. Especially in how Gabby and Travis got together. I felt like it almost glorified cheating. Let me explain. Gabby has a boyfriend. A boyfriend she is waiting and hoping will propose. But the author does a great just job of showing that actions are taken with first the thought. What I mean by that is, every step Gabby took towards Travis was a very conscious decision. He had a very romantic weekend with Travis and all of a sudden Gabby and Travis know they are meant to be together. Now I understand that as soon as Gabby chose Travis she quickly ended it with her boyfriend but it still doesn't excuse (in my mind) that she cheated...big time. I loved the turn of events and the choices that had to be made throughout the whole book, before the ultimate relationship between Gabby and Travis and afterwards. It was really sweet-the afterwards. Overall: I really enjoyed this story. Despite my mixed feelings about Gabby being in a relationship when she got together with Travis. It was interesting to see how Sparks decided to build the story to ultimately reach its climatic turn of events.

B) her brother is the one who ran over my wife, should I stick to her? C) she cannot haver children, should I stick to her? D) she says that, in order to be with me, I should stop sending letters on bottles to my dead wife, should I stick to her? E) she said that, if she\u2019d ever be in a coma, I should turn off the machines after 12 weeks, should I respect it? (view spoiler) [This dilemma E) would\u2019ve provided a great book. Really. I congratulate him for thinking of it. However, I asked a person that I love if she\u2019d do it for me. Would she turn off the machines if I went through a coma? She said no \u2013 that\u2019s against God\u2019s will. And I knew she didn\u2019t love me enough. Well, I must have a really pushy idea on love, so I hated the book. Hated isn\u2019t enough. I ABOMINE the message sold by this book. I was incredulous with how SMALL the love sold on these pages is. What if people who read this starts to think that this is true love? That to prove someone that he loves it you have to put the person through agony, having her ass being cleaned up by unknown people for fifty years? In my opinion, love just HAS to be more. More than Travis \u201cloving\u201d Gabby and not being able to imagine his life without her. If he respected her, he\u2019d never burn the legal documents when she requires this mesure. Since it\u2019s Nicholas Sparks, of course she\u2019ll raise up from the dead. In real life she\u2019d rot in bed. But guess what? The woman wakes up to a man who ignored her wishes and doesn\u2019t even get mad! A man in who she can\u2019t clearly trust. A man you\u2019ll not speak up her voice when she\u2019s out of one. A selfish man, so selfish! I cannot put a grain of faith into a love like this. This represents the second part of the book, not announced in the synopsis. The first part of the book is about how two (almost) flawless people meet each other and fall in love over two days of hanging around. Did I mention that she has a 4 year relationship? Shall I also mention that, days after their evolvement, when a work colleague tries to kiss Gabby, the so-called lover (Travis) punches him in the face and tells her to sue the \u201caggressor\u201d? Fuck logic. Where\u2019s her explanation to the boyfriend? The book has a huge hole in the middle. In a minute they\u2019re riding a motorcycle and, on the next minute, she\u2019s in coma and he loves her dearly, the two of them are married and they have two kids. (hide spoiler) ] Sparks wrote this novel over his knees. Anyway, if I ever get into a coma please remember Ram\u00f3n Sampedro\u2019s words (a Spanish citizen who spent 30 years in bed without being able to move any part of his body but his head \u2013 there\u2019s the movie, The Sea Inside): \u201cThe one who loves me is the one who\u2019ll help me die\u201d. _________________________________ PT \u00c9 para a\u00ed o d\u00e9cimo livro que leio de Nicholas Sparks depois de uma pausa de alguns anos\u2026 o \u00faltimo que tinha lido foi o Juntos ao Luar. Resumindo: continua o mesmo. Se querem conhecer o estilo recorrente de NS somem estes ingredientes: - Muitos di\u00e1logos a prop\u00f3sito de nada com piadas aleat\u00f3rias. - Chavalinho porreiro com covinhas na cara que bebe cerveja - Chavalinha com mau feitio que bebe Diet Coke - Encontros comuns \u2013 jantares, barbecues \u2013 combinados e sem nada de espont\u00e2neo, onde eles discutem a espontaneidade e decidem que v\u00e3o dar um mergulho, aprender a andar de mota, algo do g\u00e9nero. - Beijos conservadores no final desse primeiro encontro - Um vi\u00favo - Algu\u00e9m est\u00e9ril - Um acidente - Uma doen\u00e7a - Um c\u00e3o - Uma liga\u00e7\u00e3o inexplic\u00e1vel com um animal que n\u00e3o lembra a ningu\u00e9m \u2013 como o Noah da Alquimia do Amor com o cisne, ou agora o Travis com um pombo . - Um dilema moral complicado, do g\u00e9nero: a) ela est\u00e1 a morrer, vale a pena ficar com ela? b) ela diz que para ficar com ela tenho que deixar de mandar garrafas com mensagens \u00e0 minha mulher que morreu c) ela n\u00e3o pode ter filhos, fico com ela? d) o irm\u00e3o dela \u00e9 que atropelou e matou a minha mulher, fico com ela? e) ela pediu que, caso ficasse em coma, etc., eu devia desligar as m\u00e1quinas ao final de doze semanas. Desligo? Este dilema e) teria dado um livro excelente. A s\u00e9rio. Gabo-lhe o ter pensado nessa quest\u00e3o, embora n\u00e3o seja totalmente nova, e teria sofrido e vivido realmente este tema. Tudo porque, saberei l\u00e1 eu explicar, fiz o mesmo pedido a uma pessoa pr\u00f3xima. Se por algum motivo ficar em estado vegetativo, ajudem-me a morrer, j\u00e1 que c\u00e1 n\u00e3o se pode escolher esse desligar das m\u00e1quinas, segundo sei. A pessoa disse que n\u00e3o o faria. N\u00e3o o faria porque gosta de mim. Bom eu devo ter uma ideia muito distorcida do amor, detestei. N\u00e3o, detestei n\u00e3o chega, DETESTEI, em caps, a mensagem que o Sparks passa neste livro. Fiquei indignada com a pequenhez deste amor que ele descreve e que vende, e que muitas mulheres/homens, se \u00e9 que o l\u00eaem, compram como o ideal. O \u00fanico, o genu\u00edno. E a dignidade humana? A mulher teria de ficar meses \u2013 anos\u2026! \u2013 \u00e0 espera de acordar numa cama, quem sabe se aprisionada no pr\u00f3prio corpo mas consciente, a ansiar por ser libertada? Por poder morrer? Para lhe removerem os tubos que lhe sust\u00eam a vida? Com o corpo a atrofiar-se? O rabo a ser limpo por terceiros? Amor, para mim, tem de ser mais. Mais do que ele gostar dela e n\u00e3o imaginar a vida sem ela. Se a ama respeita-a. Se a respeita cumpre o que ela lhe pediu, em desespero. Mas n\u00e3o, mais vale arriscar, queimar os pap\u00e9is legais onde ela estipula esse pedido e fazer figas para que ainda esteja vivo um dia, se ela acordar. E depois, como \u00e9 Nicholas Sparks *spoiler* a senhora claro que acorda. E nem se zanga! \u00c9 escusado dizer que, se fosse eu, embora agradecesse a oportunidade para ter regressado, me separasse quase certamente de um homem em que n\u00e3o podia confiar. \u00c9 isso o amor, n\u00e3o? Pedir a algu\u00e9m que nos d\u00ea voz quando ela nos falta, e esperar que repita as nossas palavras sem ego\u00edsmos. E ele foi ego\u00edsta, t\u00e3o ego\u00edsta\u2026! N\u00e3o concebo amores assim. Passada a fase da indigna\u00e7\u00e3o acrescento que isto representa a segunda parte do livro. A primeira deve-se ao modo como estes dois vizinhos se conhecem e a sinopse s\u00f3 se debru\u00e7a sobre ela. Ora a senhora tem namorado \u2013 quase noivo \u2013 e, ao final de tr\u00eas dias, j\u00e1 anda enrolada com o vizinho. True love, says Nicholas Sparks. Devo mencionar que, dias depois quando um colega de trabalho dela tenta beij\u00e1-la o dito vizinho o esmurra e a aconselha a abrir um processo contra ele de agress\u00e3o f\u00edsica? Fuck logic. Onde est\u00e1 a explica\u00e7\u00e3o dela ao namorado quando o larga? O livro sofre um pulo. Ora est\u00e3o a passear de mota e conhecem-se h\u00e1 tr\u00eas dias, ora j\u00e1 ela est\u00e1 em coma e ele a ama perdidamente, anos depois, casados e com filhos. O senhor escreveu o livro nos joelhos. A Presen\u00e7a, mesmo na 8\u00aa edi\u00e7\u00e3o, tem o livro cheio de gralhas. N\u00e3o admira que seja dos dele de que menos se fala\u2026 Enfim, se eu entrar em coma, se eu tiver um AVC e n\u00e3o puder falar, se eu partir o pesco\u00e7o e implorar a algu\u00e9m que me ajude a ter paz, fa\u00e7am-no! Como dizia Ram\u00f3n Sampedro (Mar Adentro), Aquele que me ama \u00e9 aquele que me ajudar\u00e1 a morrer.

Now Travis has to make a 'choice' (clever use of a title....not) after he breaks his perfection by making a mistake and putting Gabby in a coma. I spent the whole book hoping that the next page I turned would be the last. I love sappy romance, but I like believable sappy romance, and there wasn't much here.

Why is it that life seems so much sweeter after tragedy? Maybe gratitude isn't a natural state - it's just something we come to through experience. I just finished Nicholas's new book The Choice which tells the love story of Gabby and Travis. Even though Sparks devoted most of the novel to the cute yet predictable narrative of their history together, he made one smart move at the start: a captivating prologue. Oftentimes I believe the prologue is a sign of weak writing. A good author shouldn't need one to draw you into the story - if they do then they're beginning the story at the wrong place. However, this book really needed that. It lent a depth to the first half of the novel which would have been absent otherwise and encouraged readers to keep going even though it seemed a little too fluffy at times. The other interesting topic he raises is cheating. I have to say this made me a little uncomfortable and did make me a little ticked off. I mean, just because the characters are meant for each other does not justify dishonesty and deception. The other thing is that I am SURE I read in an interview that Nicholas Sparks said he'd NEVER write about adultery. You see, he is openly Christian and doesn't believe in writing about things against his own moral code. If I can find the quote where he says that, I'll post it here. It was a case of 'just when you thought the story was a bit dull the character does something morally repugnant'. That was actually enough to keep me interested. I wanted to see why Sparks made that particular literary decision. Sparks had some ground to make up after this incident though because as the reader, I thought there was no reason for it. Not having Gabby confront her boyfriend made her seem a little weak. That's when you jump to the next part of the story and where Sparks really shines...the tragedy! God I love it. The thrilling part of reading his work is that you never know if you'll get a happy ending. Right up until the second-last page of The Choice I wasn't sure which it would be. And I cried like a baby the whole time. This wouldn't be Sparks' best work but he's one of those authors you usually can't go wrong with. Well, except maybe for True Believer and Dear John. They seemed a little like mid-career slump novels to me. He is such a quick-read and the world seems such a richer place when you're finished. People argue that the kind of drama he writes about isn't realistic. I beg to differ. You only have to read an interview with him to know that most of his stories are inspired by real life. Guess what folks, life is tragic. It's the meaning that we gain from tragedy and the love that touches us that makes it all worthwhile. Aah Nicholas, a man after my own heart. I'll forgive you the cheating but only cause it was such a satisfying ending. ...more 5/5 - I've read a lot of romances, and I mean a lot (over 300), but somehow I've managed to miss reading anything by Nicholas Sparks.

The only ones I've missed are Message in a Bottle (just looked way too sad for me) and The Choice (too new). After reading the book I'm glad I didn't shell out for cinema tickets to the movie. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the book (I read it in one night, something about it must have grabbed my attention), but a rom-com isn't really the kind of movie worth going to the cinema to see unless it's particularly spectacular (or someone else is paying). And now that I've read the book I'm pleased to see that I made the right choice in waiting for it to come to tv (which doesn't take all that long these days, only a few months most of the time). SPOILERS!!!!!!!! The second part was a bit of tear jerker once I realised what the reveal was, as Travis' dilemma is my worst nightmare. Like Travis I'm not sure if I could make that final decision despite knowing that's what at least one of my family members would choose. I would always be terrified by the idea that if I waited just one more minute, one more second they might wake up. Even if the probability were low, it's never completely impossible and I don't know if I could deal with the possibility that I was killing my family member when there was any likelihood that they weren't gone. I look forward to reading more from Sparks although I think I'll do my best to avoid the more depressing ones, I'm not a fan of books that make me full-on cry. ...more I surely have a problem. I read another book from Sparks. He is trying to be Jodie Picoult, but it's not going for him. His characters are awfully shallow and stereotypical - his story is so so, but he doesn't know how to describe it. He is a Budweiser guy, she is shy and naive. He is uber sexy, she is not so. And he tells her he loves her after 2 days (although he was a complete vagabond for his 30something years), and she does as well, but he tells her that first.

Sparks' popular psychology analysis are ridiculous. He is funny with his free advices that are too general and one-dimensional. And I'm being eloquent now. The only thing that I like about his book(s) is how he describes (North) Carolinas. Writers from that US area always describe their states with great words and gentle connotations. Overall, I like southern literature, just it would be nice to find proper writers. I can't just solely depend on Pat Conroy. ...more WOW !! This book takes my breath away. The title of the book is so right and I hope that I will never have to do that choice. Nicholas Sparks wrote another incredible book that I won't forget any soon!

I find this one different because even though the back cover describes the book to be about Travis, most of the story line is about Gabby's side of view in there whole time of getting to know each other. The first part of the story starts out in Feb 2007, and Travis is going to the hospital where is wife worked to see her. Unsure of the choice he was going to make. It dates back to when they first met and how they came about to fall in love. Gabby moved in next door to Travis. She has a purebred collie who is pregnant and believes Travis' dog is responsible. As she goes over to his house to tell him to take responsiblitiy everthing thing goes wrong. She ends up leaving like a stupid person and finds out that Travis is the vet. Evenutally they spend a weekend together while Gabby's boyfriend is out of town, as friendly neighbors with all of Travis' married friends. By the third day they know they are in love and she decides to be with Travis. In the second part of the story, Travis is sitting at the hospital going over his memories of the past and how they get married and have two girls. Some of the fights they have, and why things started to go wrong. Travis and Gabby were in a horrible car accident and she went into a coma. As Travis sits at the hospital he is trying to make \"the choice\" that will change his life. Gabby made Travis sign a living will, where if she was ever in a coma; after three months if she didn't wake up, he promises to let her die. She made him do it because of some one she met a hospital who the husband went insane because the wife was put in a nursing home and after six years was still in a coma. The kids went off the deep end too, and Gabby didn't want that to happen to her family. After three months Travis makes his decision . . . I can't spoil the ending for you all, you'll just have to read it. I will say during the second part have some tissues handy it was a tear jerker. It does end well as all his books do, I closed the book feeling satisfied. ...more Really enjoyed this one!

There are no in betweens with this author. He either taps into my emotional psyche and has me on the verge of tears, or takes me to the opposite extreme where I want to fling the book right out the window. The Choice was the former and not the latter. Living in a small North Carolina town, Travis Parker has the perfect life that\u2019s pampered with a good job, amazing friends and extreme vacations that any bachelor would envy. However when his new neighbor Gabby Holland comes storming into his yard, his existence is turned upside down in a matter of days. But spending time with Gabby, Travis begins to realize what has been missing in his life. When these two eventually fall in love, tough choices coupled with devastating events has Travis wondering \u201chow far should a person go in the name of true love?\u201d I really enjoyed this story. Despite the rocky start and my mixed feelings about Gabby being in a relationship when she got together with Travis, there was no doubt Travis and Gabby truly loved each other. It was interesting to see how Sparks decided to build the story to ultimately reach its climatic turn of events. However, what had me applauding Sparks was his decision to end this story in a way that the readers, or myself in this case, didn\u2019t regret falling for Travis and Gabby. I loved their story and adored the final conclusion that was hard earned and most definitely deserved. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with the ending... Not what I was expecting from Sparks.

I don't want to say Sparks is being irresponsible, but people spend a lot more time absorbing fiction and subconsciously applying it to their lives than they do medical research. So for many, this novel is the only interaction with brain injury they've had. Oh, and yet another Sparks story where a woman is practically engaged and then falls in love with another man. Please, can we stop making women look like we can't make the right decision the first time around?! ...more But what if . . . No one can write a love story like Nicholas Sparks.

There is always something that sort of test the couple\u2019s love for one another and this one was no different. The story is broken up into two parts and with the start of part two, I felt like one thing was happening, when in fact, it was something totally different. Something worse actually.

Urgh there is nothing that pisses me off faster than insta-love - especially when it is with a couple that has absolutely no chemistry what so ever to being with. This book gets marginally better during the second part (which mind you, was 200 pages into the book) but even then I felt like nothing was happening and that the plot could have been condensed to around 50 pages.
