Here's a cool little 1 minute video that gives you a visual look at some of the changes in style , if you're interested. Alright. What I didn't know was the hows and whys. And to be honest, it never occurred to me to delve much deeper. There was a revolution, some religious nutters took over, and then everyone started dressing like they were back in the stone ages. People in my country choose to wear burkas, so I just assumed most of the people in Iran thought it was a good thing. Now, maybe my original views sound sort of stupid, but in my defense, I honestly don't understand why anyone does anything when it comes to religion. So covering yourself head to toe doesn't sounds any weirder than not using birth control, avoiding certain foods, or refusing medical treatment. And don't get me started on that My Husband is the Head of the House shit... My point is, if people willing do those things because of religious beliefs, why not clothing stuff? Hello? Amish, much? But really this story is about much more than just clothes. It's about the slow and methodical war waged on freedom of any kind in Iran, and it's told through the eyes of a woman who lived through it as a child. Since she comes from a wealthy and educated household, you get a different perspective than maybe you would otherwise. Her parents are actively protesting the changes, while also trying to maintain a sense of normalcy in their home. Growing up in a home like that made an impression on her, and you can see how she bucks and rebels as she approaches her teenage years. She wasn't raised to be quiet and docile, so she chafes under her country's regime. My son and I read this one right around the same time, and he thought it was an incredibly enlightening story, as well. Actually, he said something like this: Hey, that was pretty cool. I didn't know any of that stuff happened in Iran. High praise from the teenager! Anyway, I'm looking forward to reading the second part of this story, because...

Here are some instances that made me put down the book and think for a while (they contain *spoilers* ): (Those final moments broke my heart.) \"He never got to see his son\" resonated with me deeply. The relationships between the families, especially between Marji and her mother, also hit home for me. There was one instance in particular that stayed with me\u2014 when her mother was willing to sew posters into her own coat just to bring them back to her daughter without marks. (It actually hurt when she thanked her father first.) And the feelings of fear and terror and bravery Marji felt during the war were captured in such an honest way that I couldn't help but feel them with her. The incredibly supportive women and men in Marji\u2019s life were inspiring. They all held a significant part in her journey, and it just made me tear up towards the end, especially when Marji left for Vienna. (I just... I keep looking at that last frame and tearing up.) All in all, this graphic novel was a complete game-changer for me, and I seriously cannot believe it took me so long to pick up. *Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

I will read them again and again until I remember every single sentence c. I will not lend them to people :p. Tita introduced me to these books. I have been very interested on Iran and was even contemplating to read the autobiography of Farah Pahlavi, the Empress of Iran. After repeated visits to the bookshop to flip the pages of this autobiography, I wasn't sure if I wanted to part with my money for the typical self-indulgent autobiography. So Persepolis immediately caught my interest and I wasn't disappointed. The books tell an honest and poignant story of a well-to-do family during the political turmoil in Iran from the perspective of the little and, in book II, adult Marjane Satrapi. The story is told thru' a stark black and white drawing. I marvel at her ability to present only relevant and interesting highlights of her life and Iran and meld them all to one solid, flowing story. They are sometimes tragic moments but told without self-pity. In between, there are generous doses of light, funny moments. I laugh and I cry reading this book. One of the most powerful parts for me is when the parents, who love her so much, let her go to study in Austria. She talks about how horrible goodbyes are and how important it is not to look back after you say your goodbyes. You can be scarred with the image you see when looking back. How true... I won't say more about these books. All I can suggest is read them. You won't regret it. They open mind to what hardship can be when freedom of self is not allowed. They are enganging. They are entertaining. They are sad. They are funny. They are everything I hope a book can be. Thanks Tita. ...more Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/ Of all the banned books I\u2019ve read over the years, THIS one might be the one that I really can\u2019t figure out a reason for banning.

In a couple of years I\u2019ll gladly let them peruse my bookshelves and read whatever all of the nutters tell them not to. It was thinking of those nutters that left me shaking my head at the choice of banning Persepolis . I mean, there\u2019s no sex, no drugs, no foul language \u2013 it\u2019s simply a memoir of a girl who lived through the Islamic Revolution in Iran. Generally when the whackjobs take a break from their cultlike book burnings they are all about sharing anything that points out how horrible the Middle East is. I guess at some point they just decided to go all Oprah with respect to book bans . . . . *shrug* I, for one, am absolutely delighted that Banned Books Week led me to discover Persepolis . What a brilliant (and so very important) little book. Marjane Satrapi was able to detail the history of the Revolution and its lasting effects on not only her family but Iran as a whole with humor . . . a lot of humor . . . and compassion . . . and the heartbreak of a nation combined with the reality of her own life . . . It showed that no matter what might be broadcast on the evening news that people are people and even those of us who are separated by half a world have more similarities than differences. It also tackled how important it is to talk to your children about big issues . . . and to open their mind even further by using the thing the banners continue to try (but fail) to take away . . . . My friend Matthew was the first to express his love for Persepolis when he saw it on my \u201cCurrently Reading\u201d list and he unleashed his rebellious side and read a banned book this week too. I hope my kids are half as awesome as he is when they grow up. And to any other \u201ckids\u201d out there reading this \u2013 just say damn the man . . . ...more \u0645\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639\u0627 \u0646\u0645\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0633\u062a\u0645

One thing I learned here..History has its means to keep repeating itself..Anywhere it wish Yeah, we felt so...25 Jan. 2011, 30 June 2013...and yet it was just for few day, And still it's from worse to worst.. -------- The Story In very simple comics, even childish, comes a very excellent heavy family life story, Country history, a very well done melodrama. About coming of age that really touching. I loved Marjane so much and her amazing parents. It take place from 1979 to 1985 , where the young girl witnessed all the depressive rules of the new \u201cIslamic Government\u201d The good thing is the richness of her family both in money and culture...even their ancestors. That makes a very helpful great insight into the history of Iran, and the major political turns. Most of these things I didn't know - or even if I read it once in text books I may never remember it as I will after reading this novel- I loved her wanna be a prophet.. it's of course unspeakable in my religion but it comes in a childish nice way...that's okay since she wanted the good deeds as Zarathustra. This first part is divided into 9,10 pages chapters, each with a title that may makes small appearance or bigger one but it has strong effect in the story. It's brilliant really I loved the naming of the chapters so much. There was a good diversity of the characters' opinions and how the new government effects them, but I felt that adding a Jewish family into the story was just \u201cinserted\u201d for the purpose of showing diversity and how everyone been effected by the horrors of the war.. it really could have been presented better to not feel that \u201calien\u201d. I loved that nostalgic feel that everyone in the middle east must got with the passion about the western music and culture. And was hard to see how much trouble it get those who liked it in that time in Iran. I really had teary eyes by the last scenes of book one, I really liked the parents so much, how much affection they gave Marjane that I believe what really saved her by the end. I have to say I may have a minor refuse of some of the very liberal acts of the family, mostly for religious reasons.. yet Part one still very acceptable compared to part two which\u2026 Well let that when it comes to talk about book two.

Through bold and contrasting black and white inking and simple artwork the artist opens a window through which the reader can witness the daily life, it\u2019s emotions, the history and terror from those days leading to and following the Islamic revolution as seen through Marjane\u2019s own eyes . \u2018Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood\u2019 brings some of the key moments of Iran\u2019s history during the 70s and 80s \u2013 like the oust of Shah\u2019s regime, the triumph of the Islamic Revolution and subsequent morphing of the society towards orthodoxy through banning of secular education and imposing the veil, the devastating effects of war with Iraq, it's refugee situations \u2013 all beautifully intertwined with the personal moments from Marjane\u2019s family with strong humor which makes the narrative more special for the reader. Marjane was born into a well-to-do family and her parents were quite liberal in their outlook and this makes Marjene who is intelligent and outspoken as a child to have her own opinions and views on everything that is happening around her. At times her outspoken character and passion for freedom lands her in trouble at school and even with authorities. Being born into a well-to-do atmosphere helps her in bringing out the sharp contrast in her family\u2019s life and the general life of the outside public in a vividness, a contrast which is contributed by the clever use of the black and white frames. Though each frame Marjane try to find an explanation and solution for the madness happening around her. Some of the visuals \u2013 like those which show her having imaginary conversations with god about matters around her when she is nine; conversations with her uncle who was imprisoned in U.S.S.R; the way she shows her anger at God asking him to \u2018 get out \u2019 from her room on the night of hearing her uncles death; her visual interpretation of the state fed recruitment campaign of \u2018 to die a martyr, is to inject blood into the veins of society \u2019; she furtively smoking a cigarette in protest against the \u2018 dictatorship \u2019 of her mother and then self declaring \u2018 with the first cigarette, I kissed childhood goodbye \u2019; she glimpsing the horrors of war through victims of chemical warfare at a hospital facility - are quite powerful in their depiction. In the scene where Marjane comes across the body of her friend from the neighborhood among the rubbles after a missile attack there is a single frame of illustration, which can be seen as one of the most brilliant uses of the visual format of storytelling. When she covers her face in horror with her hand, the total numbness and pain that Marjane feels over her friend\u2019s death can be experienced in next cartoon panel, which is totally blank and black with a small subtext, \u201c No scream in the world could have relieved my suffering & anger \u201d. This cleverness and creativity of the author as an illustrator can be further seen in the depictions of the young Marjane herself. The various emotions \u2013 surprise, anger, frustration, confusion, helplessness, terror - that the artist capture on the face of young Marji gives the character a soul which can make her feel like a long known friend for the reader. The narrative of the first volume ends when Marjane leaves for Austria when she is 15 to continue her studies at a more liberal and open European environment. \u2018Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood\u2019, is a powerful and heartbreaking graphical rendering of the dark times of a society which was shrouded in the horrors of war and oppression from the viewpoints of a young girl who is confused and trying to understand what is happening around her. The tasteful humor and dominant insights that the author artfully infuses into her visual panels gives this book a freshness, which will invigorate reader rather than completely sliding him into the chasms of depression and sadness. This is one of those graphic novels, which can find audience even among those readers who are quite skeptical about the comic-book genre. A note to the reader : Since \u2018Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood\u2019 is told from the perspective of the young Marjane, the author intent seems to focus around expressing her confusions, her doubts and her attempts in trying to understand the world into which she was born. Understanding the fact that the author was not trying to create an accurate historical or political volume on Iran will help you in enjoying this book in a better way. This can be read from the words of Marjane Satrapi herself in an interview from 2008. \" I use myself to talk about other things. I'm not a historian, not a sociologist. I'm a person born in a place where I've seen some stuff. That's why I put myself in as a character. \" ...more 4.5 stars I went into Persepolis with all the ignorance of an European girl born in the '90s.

Because we may send our soldiers to fight, but it's always somewhere else. Things are changing. I don't feel that safe anymore. And in a time of fear and escalating paranoia, when people all around me murmur and whisper that they're all terrorists, they're all fundamentalists, they're all the same , blinded by ignorance and hatred, I feel the need to do something for my own ignorance. To educate myself on all the things I still don't know about the world. I didn't know a lot about the Islamic Revolution in Iran. The history books I read at school and university do not seem to care about it very much; it's always about the West. Students barely have any idea of what the past was like in the rest of the world, because the general opinion is that they do not really care. The few things I knew about it were just from the news and the newspapers, a book here and there, a fleeting mention by my parents; but still, a very faraway reality. I am a fairly political person, if you can call it that, but I'm not trying to turn this into a political debate. Terrorism has always been real. Strangely enough, though, we hardly ever hear of all the people that are killed in the Middle East, because their lives seem somehow to be less important than ours. Because until something hurts us - the ones with the money, the power, the technology and the weapons - it remains invisible. Persepolis is Marjane Satrapi's autobiography, set in Iran in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The art style is simple, in black and white, almost childlike, and its simplicity manages to make the narrated events even more impactful. Satrapi tells the story of the Islamic Revolution with the innocent voice of a young girl and yet, it is immediately evident how easily her mind was influenced by the world around her - her school, her parents, the news, the things people told her. She did not know what to believe. Had the Shah truly been chosen by God? Did she really have to wear the hijab, if she didn't want to? Why did she have to go to an all-girls school? Why couldn't she wear tight jeans, or denim jackets, or go to parties? My impression is that the Western world often wants us to think that it's us against them , the oh-so-civilized West against the Middle East, and to forget that the people who are not fundamentalists are, in fact, the vast majority. Satrapi doesn't try to make her childhood in Iran look better than it was, but she doesn't try to make Iranians look like pliant puppets either. They fight. They resist. Satrapi's parents are revolutionaries, and since childhood she experiences the fear of imprisonment and death, sees her classmates go to their fathers' funerals, the people around hear flee to Sweden, the United States, England. After a while, she starts to rebel, too. In the middle of Teheran, the fighter-bombers cross the sky and people are forced to hide because of the bombings, and still, Marjane speaks up at school, listens to Iron Maiden, and reads books she's not supposed to read. In her own way, just like her parents, she fights back too. I can't recommend this graphic novel enough. It does not spare the reader the horrors of war, but it also shows things from the naive and yet extremely perceptive perspective of a child. It is not an history lesson - though it does give a lot of information about the Islamic Revolution in Iran, which I really appreciated - and it is both moving and educational. ...more Well, having read the book, I went also to see the film last night.

But I will probably not wish to go to see the musical or buy the soundtrack of the musical with specially commissioned songs by Sting and Bono and Madonna and Cher and several other rock stars who only have one name, all their other names having been given to their favourite charities to auction off. I didn't read Persepolis Book Two so was interested that the film incorporates both books. However my joy turned to large bananas which have been left too long in the fruit bowl of life and are now blackened and soggy, as I came to realise that the perky sassy girl of Part One grew up to be the miserable pain in the ass shoegazing student of Part Two. So the movie demonstrated the curious fact that you can have the most exotic of backgrounds (Iran! revolution! fundamentalism! war!) and still be a dullard. (I should interpose that the visual aspect of the movie is very pretty, and when one has determined that the political content is close to zero, one can transfer one's attention to the exhuberant cartooning without a qualm). There are two very odd things about this two-book-one-movie : the word AYATOLLAH is never mentioned, not once. As neither is the other word ISLAM. But if I recall correctly, Iran experienced an ISLAMic revolution led by the AYATOLLAH Khomeini. So this is like \"My Life in Germany 1930-1940\" without mentioning Hitler or the Nazi Party. That's odd! Maybe she'd be on the receiving end of an icepick haircut if she named names, but still. Also odd is the apparent fact that the author's family could send the author out of Iran to Vienna for years at a time - not once, but twice! What implications does this have for our view of the intolerable oppression of the regime? So in spite of all its trappings, Persepolis in the end is as political and insightful as Shopaholic, i.e. not political and not insightful, and gets away with it because the author can not unreasonably retort that political acumen was quite outside of her purview as she was growing up trying to score Iron Maiden cassettes and trying on lurid shades of lipstick; whence come all the cardboard cutouts which populate the movie, and whence all the unexplained actions and motivations. The dialogue from the adults in her early life is either \"the regime tortured your uncle without mercy. He was a communist\" or \"I put jasmine leaves in my bra every day\". It seems Persepolis has gained its popularity from sheer quaintness. I was looking for more. ...more \"Persepolis\" is a widely acclaimed memoir/graphic novel, it was rated highly by several of my fellow readers and therefore I've had my eye on it for a while.

The cartoonish style of the drawing is superb, the subject matter is very current, the combination of tragedy and humor is clever. However, as a political memoir, \"Persepolis\" lacks. I don't know exactly why, but I never got a grip on what Satrapi's personal views on the politics within her country are. In fact, I am not even sure if she really knows what what was happening in her country. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that this memoir ends when the author is 14 (although writing it as an adult, she should be able to present her views clearly). Or maybe it is because Satrapi herself never personally experiences any hardship in this book. I find it very interesting that in times of turmoil, during the civil war for democracy, during the rise of religious fundamentalism, during the war with Iraq, Satrapi's family never seems to experience any discomfort. Quite the opposite, when people die and suffer, the writer's most hardship is to hide the liquor at a party (which they are not supposed to have), or to wear a headscarf, or to get an \"Iron Maiden\" poster through customs. This narration from a perspective of a person in power is a little disheartening and has a bit of a fake tone to it, as if the author doesn't know what is really happening in her country and writes about from her million dollar mansion while being served by one of her maids. It's not a bad book, especially for younger readers who want to know a little bit about Iran and its current political events. It is presented in a very appealing, easy format. But for me personally this book appears to be too superficial to leave any kind of lasting impression. I will however read the second part of the memoir. Maybe it will have some more insight.

In this book, Satrapi reminisces her life in Tehran during the Islamic Revolution and the Iran\u2013Iraq War - a time of oppression and dejection. Of course, with the Islamic Revolution came the arrival of the high and mighty chador. As I continued reading, you could strongly feel the push and pull between a rebellious culture and it's new dictatorial government. Satrapi did a marvelous job of graphically making this a reality. And as the revolution continued, Satrapi got older. And the more she was restricted, the more she rebelled. Being an Iranian myself and having heard many tragic stories such as this, this is a topic I can genuinely say I was able to sympathise with. Persepolis isn't perfect, but I'm willing to read the others in the series. Overall, it's a unique memoir that will forever be a reminder of my heritage. ...more I intentionally avoided the movie version of this book.

As I reflect the events of this book, I remember my perception of events in Iran: the revolution, the hostage crisis, the war with Iraq. Having lived in Italy from 1977-79, I feel a little closer to these events than I would have, had I been \"buried\" in American concerns at the time. My father was a military man, and we were living in a foreign country. While I never will know how Satrapi felt about the events in her own country (nor would I want to know), I can at least more closely approximate the emotions she must have felt at the time than if I had been born under other circumstances, in a different place, in a different time. Persopolis has faint echoes of Maus . Satrapi's voice even sounds similar to Spiegelman's. If you liked Maus you will probably like Persepolis . I was amazed by how much I didn't know about events in Iran at that time. I consider myself a pretty well-informed person, when it comes to history (flashes MA in History from UW-Madison), but I was unaware of the sheer complexity of the Iranian situation in the late '70 and early '80s. This book doesn't just outline these issues, but goes into some depth regarding how difficult it was for one girl and her family to navigate the fluid and quickly-changing political and social landscape of Iran at the time. There are lots of lessons to be learned here. Satrapi fancied that she would grow up to be a prophet when she was younger, and I think she might well have succeeded with this work. Not a prophet who foretells doom, but a prophet who recounts the errors of the past and puts them up as a warning to the world. ...more I am as middle class (we call it affectionately, the \"poor rich\" where I live.)

Under the Raygun (Reagan)administration I entertained the possibility that I would have to emigrate for political reasons (ha, and let's just say the thought has cropped up again recently.) How was America different from Iran -- no, that is too broad a way to state it. The question on my mind was how does your country become totalitarian, authoritarian, repressive -- and you still live there and didn't resist? Read Persepolis to find out. Yes, it is a girl's growing up story. Yes, it isn't really about the parents. But when you read it, you can see that great evil can just sneak its way into your life because it comes just a babystep at a time. No, the Iranian intellectuals and professionals were not very different from their American counterparts.

This irani woman inspired me a lot. ...more This is a good book. Satrapi writes with a powerful voice. One can easily imagine her childhood and early life.

This could have easily been a written memoir, about a young girl\u2019s life in Iran, but it would lose something special. The graphic novel format of Persepolis gives it an innocence that resonates with the story. It helps to deliver the story as seen through the eyes of a child. Not to mention how accessible it makes it to a wide range of ages. Persepolis is the story of the author and artist, Marjane Satrapi, growin Persepolis takes advantage of the graphic novel format like few books have before. This could have easily been a written memoir, about a young girl\u2019s life in Iran, but it would lose something special. The graphic novel format of Persepolis gives it an innocence that resonates with the story. It helps to deliver the story as seen through the eyes of a child. Not to mention how accessible it makes it to a wide range of ages. Persepolis is the story of the author and artist, Marjane Satrapi, growing up in Iran during the fall of the Shah and the ensuing Islamic Revolution. Marjane and her family are not supporters of the Western backed Shah, they even cheer as he flees and is removed from power. They are not religious fanatics either, so once the Shah absconds to Egypt, and an Islamic regime is established, Marjane\u2019s family finds themselves in what takes shape as an unfamiliar country. Marjane is an extremely charming narrator. She guides us through the rise of the Islamic regime in Iran and the following war with Iraq. She experiences the dangers that the rising Islamic regime pose to her and her family. The fear of being arrested, tortured, and even killed is all chillingly shown through the eyes of Marjane. She cannot go out in public wearing a pair of new sneakers without having to fear admonishment for displays of decadence. The climate gets so unpredictable and dangerous that Marjane\u2019s parents come to the conclusion that the best thing for their daughter would be to leave Tehran so that she may study in Vienna. The art in Persepolis is fantastic, and it really works to convey the important sense of innocence throughout a troubling time; it makes the story both endearing and heartbreaking. The use of the black and white panels enhances the focus on the story itself. You could easy go through this book without looking at any of the captions or dialogue and know the story from Satrapi\u2019s illustrations alone; that is the sign of an excellent comic. Don\u2019t go in expecting to get a full history of Iran through Persepolis . Sure there are a few scenes that cover the installation of the Shah and some Iranian history, but this is not intended to be a history of Iran or the Islamic revolution in Iran. It is the memoir of a childhood, and her experiences growing up during this cultural shift; the story of a family struggling to make sense in a dangerously changing world; the story of a young girl and her family losing their country. This is a great book, well worth the read for anybody. It sheds light on a culture and the history of a country that still is unfamiliar to American except when it comes to villainizing and inflamed rhetoric. It\u2019s a wonderful childhood memoir that masterfully uses the graphic medium to tell a powerfully moving story. ...more Here's why you should read Persepolis :- i)Satrapi talks about the pleasures and pains of being born as a female in a country under a most repressive Islamist regime, without ever sounding too serious or preachy. ii)Iran's history during the growing years of Marji is summarized for you in a few pages along with the political and socio-cultural background of the times. iii)This book features, by far, the coolest pair of parents that I've ever read about in a novel or book (or that I can think of at Here's why you should read Persepolis :- i)Satrapi talks about the pleasures and pains of being born as a female in a country under a most repressive Islamist regime, without ever sounding too serious or preachy. ii)Iran's history during the growing years of Marji is summarized for you in a few pages along with the political and socio-cultural background of the times. iii)This book features, by far, the coolest pair of parents that I've ever read about in a novel or book (or that I can think of at the moment). iv)It offers you a very original and true-to-life account of revolution, war and its inevitable consequences. v)Themes such as disillusionment with religion and the sheer absurdity of religious dogma are explored in the book in the most offhand manner. v)A steady undercurrent of humour runs through the length of the book, lessening the gravity of the backdrop and sometimes even depressing situations. Sample these :- Marji's mom:- \"Our country has always known war and martyrs. So, like my father said:'When a big wave comes, lower your head and let it pass!'.\" Marji's inner monologue at this:- \"That's very Persian. The philosophy of resignation.\" Marji's enraged father to her school headmistress :- 'If hair is as stimulating as you say, then you need to shave your mustache!' (when the latter scolds the school girls for wearing their veils improperly enough to show hair) (What a cool dad to have! No honestly.) vi)Last but not the least, it packs in all of the above mentioned points into a graphic novel (with very simple artwork) of 160 pages which can be enjoyed by readers of all ages and read in about 3 hours flat or less. Can't wait to know what happens to Marji in Austria in the next volume. ...more \u0645\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0627\u062a\u0631\u0627\u067e\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0634

Revolution in Iran. It is so moving and deeply touching to actually see and read what she went through, as well as witnessing the gradual loss of innocence that came with living in war. I recommend this to everyone. It shows a different side of the history of Iran - one that I knew very little about. A graphic novel describing how it was like growing up during the Islamic Revolution in Iran Cultural relativists as far back as Sextus Empiricus or Michel Montaigne, or as recent as William Graham Sumner or Gilbert Harman, often make compelling arguments that there are no objective standards for judging other societies/beliefs. Yet Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis achieves in 153 pages what cultural relativists deny as possible and what most political pundits can never fully articulate: an informed and justifiable criticism of an existing cultural paradigm. Satrapi's method is deceptively Cultural relativists as far back as Sextus Empiricus or Michel Montaigne, or as recent as William Graham Sumner or Gilbert Harman, often make compelling arguments that there are no objective standards for judging other societies/beliefs. Yet Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis achieves in 153 pages what cultural relativists deny as possible and what most political pundits can never fully articulate: an informed and justifiable criticism of an existing cultural paradigm. Satrapi's method is deceptively simple: by using her own life stories as the premise, Satrapi builds an argument for criticizing culture. Satrapi's autobiographicalized[1] self and society act both with wisdom and foolishness both before and after the revolution. The Iranian revolution meant to replace an unpopular government with one more responsive to the people's will. Until reading this book, I was unaware of any particular details of Iran during their revolution - mostly because I am a Westerner and generally not privy to accounts of day-to-day life in the Mid-East. On that basis, the cultural relativists may be right that I have no foundation on which to critically analyze the current state of Iran. Thankfully, however, Satrapi can criticize - using both an insider's and outsider's perspective. Satrapi undermines the denial of standards posited by cultural relativists by showing the reader that standards of comparison do indeed exist: standards related to varying degrees of freedom of expression, of decision, and from coercion. Satrapi's criticism is much more subtle than \"old way good, new way bad.\" Instead, she draws for the reader situation after situation where real people are swept along with the flash flood of a revolution. Satrapi, having come of age in the midst of such a flood, is able to compare her pre- and post-revolution home and draw for the reader how the people she knew dealt with that change and what they thought of it. Satrapi's art maintains a consistent, iconic style throughout the book. This allows the reader to identify more fully with the story's characters and makes for a gripping narrative flow. This iconic style is also important in reaching an audience unaccustomed to graphic novels and the myriad ways in which their authors approach narrative (Art Spiegelman's Maus is a prime example of an iconic style's appeal). What really makes Persepolis an artistic tour-de-force, however, are the more experimental panels that Satrapi intersperses into the basic narrative frame she establishes. These larger, and more visually stunning, panels interrupt the narrative, slowing (in some instances stopping) the reader in his or her tracks, drawing him or her into the intricacies of the panel. This interspersion is a type of reader manipulation especially featured in comix. There are an abundance of examples of this technique in Persepolis - panels 15.2, 29.4 are but a few. Panels 10.5, 11.1, and 11.2, in particular, defy, yet wholly contain, prosaic description, poetic symbolism, dramatic interaction, and cinematic imagery. Satrapi seems to suggest in this work that the way to bring peoples together is to allow an exchange of their cultural ideas. At times, it may appear that the unrestrained steamroller of Western culture threatens anything in its path. But is that really the case? Satrapi seems to hint that a people left free to first experience, then to choose, whether to accept or reject another culture's offerings are always better off than a people punished for experiencing other cultures. She presents with compassion her life in that earlier Iran and draws it for the reader through the filter of her current life in Western culture. She doesn't champion one culture while condemning another. She shows, through autobiography, what works and doesn't work when it comes to governing groups of human beings.

Oh, oh, oh how I hate to write these words, knowing how many people will flee screaming into the distance as I do: This is a coming-of-age story. Wait! Come back! It's not that bad, I promise! Well, the film isn't, anyway. I suggest viewing the film instead of the graphic novel. My Review : I don't much like graphic novels, seeing them as pretentious cousins to the comic book. And I never got the hang of comic books. Something that takes me ~10min to read does not make much headway with me. So when I found that my local liberry had both the graphic novel and the film of this title, I thought I'd do a fair test: Read the graphic novel first, then view the movie; compare and contrast. Movie. Definitely. Movie is as beautiful as the graphic novel, but more deeply involving because it's more nuanced in its storytelling style. But make no mistake, both versions are aesthetically sophisticated and artistically beautifully realized. I focused very little on the words of the graphic novel, because they were so-so literature and because the images were so glorious. The same, well not identical but similar, words accompanying the moving images...! Orders of magnitude of difference. Had I only experienced the graphic novel, I doubt I would have bothered to write any sort of review. The film is, well and truly, a masterwork, and possibly even a masterpiece. I know it left me wrung out and still curiously uplifted. I can't say it enough: Rent this film. Watch it with an open heart. It will reward you. ...more \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0645\u06cc\u06a9 \u0628\u0647 \u0634\u06cc\u0648\u0647

In fact, I'm pretty sure it was one of the very first books I added to my \"to-read\" list here on Goodreads when I first joined ... and that was like, more than five years ago. In case you don't already know, Persepolis is an autobiographical comic book chronicling the childhood of the author, Marjane \"Marji\" Satrapi, as she grows up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution. The story focuses on when Marji is six to fourteen years old, during which she experiences the Revolution, the overthrow of the Shah, and the beginning of the war with Iraq. I don't even really know where to start. All I can say is, HOLY HELL this book is amazing. It's less than 200 pages long and drawn in simple comic strips, and yet it's packed with so much story and so much emotion. First of all, Marji is easy to fall in love with. She's not perfect by any means, and has a lot of misunderstandings about the world, and the author is unflinching in her portrayal of her childhood self. But of course, Marji's flaws are what make her a compelling character and it's easy to sympathize with her. Secondly, loved the illustrations. They are very simplistic, and apparently for some people that takes away from the serious parts of the story. Personally, though, I thought the simple style added a lot to it. Since it's from a child's point of view, I think the illustration style makes a lot of sense. Even in the most horrific scenarios, Marji still sees through a child's innocent eyes, so it makes sense that she'd depict horrible things in a more innocent way\u2013\u2013and it's just as effective, if not more. There are a lot of striking illustrations that really stuck with me. I also love that Satrapi makes the historical context of the story accessible without it becoming too complicated or falling into too much of an info dump. She doesn't leave the reader in the dark and drops an explanation here and there, and they're not too detailed, but they're easy enough to understand. And that's important in understanding some events in the story, and also just learning about the Islamic Revolution in general. What I think I love most, though, is the balance of humor and tragedy in the book. With such dark subject matter, it would be easy to become focused on the negative rather than the positive. But Satrapi masterfully balances both the dark and the light side of her story. One moment I would be laughing out loud and the next I would be in tears. Over all, I found it to be a very touching and powerful story with a lot of heart. It's one of the only books I've ever immediately re-read after reading it the first time. I hope to read the sequel soon! ...more Marjane spent her growing up years in Iran, the daughter of wealthy-ish middle class parents.

Her formative years were during the Iranian Revolution, in which her immediate and extended family took an active part. Politically, it was a time of great unrest and uncertainty and, if her book is any indication, she spent much of her time mulling over the things she sees and hears as an only child. She's an interesting character - at times naive and idealistic, and, as she grows older, very aware of the horrible circumstances that surround her and she almost seems to revel in the horror. She is close to her family but becomes increasingly fed up with how restrictive her society becomes after Iran becomes an Islamic Republic. Oh, and of course, there's the Iran Iraq war - this woman lived through a very unstable time. I think the main reason that I liked to read her story is because it is so very different from my own story. I had no sense of politics until late high school, at least - perhaps mostly because of the country I live in and partly because my parents didn't seem to actively engage with me in discussions about it, as Marjane's parents did. I can't say that this book changed my life, or that I even got a sense of an overarching theme of \"war is bad\" or \"my childhood stunk.\" She is not a character that I felt pity for, even as horrible things are happening to her - partly because I didn't get the feeling that she was pitying herself. The graphic novel format really worked for me - I'm not sure her story would've been quite as interesting without her creative drawings. I think also, it might've been much more \"graphic\" to have had to read about all the violence instead of just seeing her take on it, which nearly always gave you the sense and idea of the violence without being overly bloody or intense. As an introduction to modern Iranian history for teens (and grownups) , I think it's fantastic - it puts a face on the masses and she does include background for the events that she experiences or hears about. I think every story we read that makes a group of people seem more familiar and their views more understandable is a story worth telling. ...more It was a decently told story, with small shining moments. I don't feel it was worth all the hype, though, and I wonder if it would have been such a success if this weren't the perfect time to tap into liberal, anti-war, pro-vaguely-Middle-Eastern sympathies throughout the West. In the end, I think the marketing was better than the story-telling.<---C>Marjane Satrapi</---C>", "Title": "Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood"},
