Under a heavy sugar coat I could see rotten flesh bubbling with old grudges, grievances and hostilities. I would love to read more about that but I guess it was a no go as the people's real names were used. The book was really chopped (a bit like my review). There were parts about Dewey, bits about Vicky's life, and the history of the town all thrown in together. They didn't blend very well but I was slightly entertained by some chapters so I am giving it two stars. Oh yeah, the cat was cute. ...more I thought I was reading a book about a cat, but I wound up reading a book about a woman with a lot of troubles in her life.

I expected a good, light-hearted story about a cat, but every time I reached a point where my spirits were lifted, Ms. Myron brought it all crashing down with the next crisis/drama involving herself and her family. There were some very sweet stories about the cat, which pushes it from one star to two. I wish there had been more. I also think it would have been a good idea to include actual testimony about Dewey from people he had touched. Also, some of the articles written about Dewey could have been included instead of the little \"notes\" recreated. They may have been cute, but honestly, by the time the longer ones were put in there, I wasn't even reading them.

Despite the variety of topics Myron writes about, her book holds together so well through her decision to write honestly about everything. Some of her personal and family history was obviously difficult to write about, but its her willingness to do so that makes this book much more than a simple book about a library cat. Dewey was, of course, the catalyst ( cat alyst) for writing the book and his story is a great one. His adventures as a library cat make for entertaining reading and any cat lover will appreciate Dewey's spirit and personality. Even more, cat lovers will nod knowingly as they read about the strong emotional bond Dewey has with those closest to him. While Myron was Dewey's \"mom\", she also has the wisdom and the insight to understand the impact one special cat can have on individual lives as well as an entire community. She also does a fine job honoring and respecting that one special cat and the impact he had on her life. ... ...more \u201cA great library doesn't have to be big or beautiful.

The cat helps change that history and give the town's heart a bit more beat. Until they acted like asses at the end of his life and started taking that for granted (typical people!) It really comes across as an almost miraculous story when the little bundle of kitten was discovered in the mail slot like discarded trash. I'm sure the librarians never imagined how popular the cat would eventually become and how much it would affect the life of the librarian, Vicki. While some of the town lore was interesting, I admit to skimming some of it. The fun antics of Dewey captivated me - I'm a cat lover myself so could relate to some of the chilling spots, box obsessions and personality quirks, but there were new cat weirdness situations that was new to me. For example, Dewey LOVES rubber bands, so much so that they had to keep them under lock and key. The cat's adorable, and if you ever wanted to know how a cat would adapt to living in a library, here you go. Cats and books go together, right? It's not just a long book about staring at a cat, but how Dewey changed the lives of several with their own histories. When Dewey started becoming one of the furry famous, the stories of interviews and different cat food commercials were more interesting that you'd think judging off description alone. Sweet stories overload - There's a tragically handicapped girl who smiled for the first time in years with Dewey's attention, people not wanting to disturb the cards because Dewey was laying in the box, people coming across the country in family trips to find the legendary cat. Dewey' doesn't just dish out the sweet stuff, though - it talks about the naysayers, the political library committees (grrr), and of course how people were less accepting of the cat who had done so much for the town with revenue and aid when he gets older and less pleasingly fuzzy. The ending is, of course, sad. I knew what was coming so that softened the blow, but I was surprised (and touched) with how much Vicki was affected for life. I won't spoil the ending with how she changes her life in a huge way, but it adds a sense of loyalty and charm to a book that was already unique and special. Besides being a treat for cat lovers, it digs into the details of how special libraries are and how much they offer patrons, especially in small towns that struggle. Through economic woes, factory shut-downs, numerous changes, the librarian and Dewey stuck around to do what they could in the small amount of time life allotted them. After reading the stories of Dewey and all his little habits, Vicki's life and her struggles with her daughter and cancer, I came to really feel like I knew both of them in a way. That's one of the best things a non-fiction book can do for a person, be authentic enough to give that personal connection. Read it for the cat, read it for the memories of the small town in Iowa, read it for the library ambience - it's worth a look even if it's just for the adorable pictures that grace the chapter headings. ...more Firstly, thank you all for enjoying putting up with my cat-story updates. As pet lovers know, we all need to talk about our pets to random strangers from time to time, so that was rather therapeutic. Dewey's story is an incredible one.

And, as shown by the 20-year difference from the beginning to the end of the book, it's highly unlikely the library would have adopted a cat in this day and age. As Vicki notes, there were complaints after Dewey showed up and it was decided that he would stay, but they appeared to be few and far between. Nowadays it would probably be unheard of because of the sheer number of people with allergies and the like. But I'm glad for Dewey and the Spencer library; glad this was able to happen and that Dewey was able to help so many people in his way, as animals do. I'm not sure why, but cats and books have always seemed to go hand-in-hand to me (I've got a photo blog basically dedicated to it), and this story was so sweet. I really found myself relating to Vicki even when she went off on tangents about the town's history or her family; I grew up in a small town, and my corner of Ohio is often surrounded by cornfields as much as her spot in Iowa seems to be, once you get out of the city a little way. Vicki's library stories also make me so thankful for the little branch library I had available when I was in school; by the time I was in high school, the branch library had been relocated and plopped square between the middle school and high school buildings and was adjoined to them via the high school library, so if the school library didn't have something I could pop through the door to the branch and be right back to school again in a minute. Now, here in Akron, we have branches all over the place and several of those Little Free Library spots, but I'm enormously spoiled by the main library. I can just imagine trying to have a library cat there -- poor thing would probably get lost and we wouldn't see him for days! But Dewey seems to have been a perfect fit for that little library in Iowa. I really appreciated Vicki's voice in this book; she came through so clearly, aided no doubt by Susan McInerney's excellent narration in the audiobook. Reading this was like talking pets, books and life with a friend; casual, but to the point and expressive. Like my own pets (cats or otherwise), Dewey will always have a place in my heart, alongside Cleo, Lava and all the other wonderful animal stories out there. ...more If you ever had a cat growing up then you have to read this book.

Well in the case of Dewey: The small-town library-cat who touched the world by Vicki Myron and Bret Witter, it doesn't. The book is a bit of a hotch-potch. It starts out as a very promising and touching animal story. The librarian of a small town library in Spencer, Iowa, discovers a tiny, frozen, furry bundle in the drop-box of her library. Incredibly, the bundle proves to be a kitten who is still alive, though barely. Which animal-lover could not fail to be moved by such an opening - especially knowing that it was a true story? The next few chapters describe how the kitten wins everyone's hearts, both staff and public. Sometimes the events are moving, sometimes comical, just as all encounters with domestic animals are in real life. Eventually the long-haired ginger kitten becomes formally adopted as a library cat, and named \"Dewey (after the library system) Readmore Books\" . A charming story. I was looking forward to the rest. Then quite a lot about the town, Spencer,'s history started to intrude. Fair enough though; it put everything in context. Spencer had had a chequered past, with changing farming and industrial needs, the Depression, the recession. Various new developments had been proposed. As a reader I went along with it, wondering when I could chuckle at Dewey's antics again. Chapter 5 was entitled, \"Catnip and rubber bands\" . Ah yes! I knew about those. I settled down happily. Gradually it shifted focus. From the introduction we had learnt a little about Spencer and the state of Iowa. This was useful information, especially for non-American readers. And the book says that even Americans tend to think of Iowa as a \"place you fly over on your way to somewhere else.\" Iowa is predominantly devoted to the farming industry; growing corn, and manufacturing all the by-products of corn, such as corn starch, xanthan gum, ethanol etc. All the additives which 21st century life seems to need. Apparently a startling 70 per cent of the average American diet is corn, in one form or another. But then in addition to all the history, the shift of emphasis to facts and figures about trade and industry, we also begin to get autobiographical information about Vicki Myron; her ancestors, her friends and co-workers, the bigwigs in the town, her current family. So now we have three different components. Searching for bits about the cat Dewey began to feel like searching for gold within the corn of Iowa. Vicki Myron's family certainly had a rough life. They seemed to have more than their fair share of bad luck and poverty, illnesses such as cancer and depression, and alcoholism and suicide. Vicki Myron herself had a troubled marriage, had to fight for the right to have a professional job, to bring up her daughter on her own, to cope with teenage alienation, and to deal with her own chronic ill-health. Many of Spencer's inhabitants suffered, some in similar ways. Life was hard, and continues to be so for many small-town folk. It would be wrong to lessen in any way the courage shown by these individuals, who have to work so hard to survive, and to continue in their community's way of life. The \"message\" of the book is that Dewey helped. Because they began to care about him, people began to regain their self-respect when they lost their jobs, or when times were tough and the future looked bleak. They began to smile more, and to fight to survive. There are stories about disabled children, or children who would never speak - until they met Dewey. Dewey brought people together, and made the library a focus for the community. And there are stories of visiting families from all over the world, as the fame of this little cat grew, of articles published in magazines, and even a small slot in a Japanese film. I have no doubt this is true. Animals have a remarkable facility to make humans feel better. Stroking a pet has been shown to lessen stress, and slow down the heart rate. But the blurb of the book says, \"This is the heart-warming and unforgettable story of a truly idiosyncratic cat with a strong sense of loyalty and love, and a taste for fast-food\" . There is just too much history of Iowa, too much ethnography, and far too much biography and autobiography, however admirable these people are. Perhaps it would interest some readers in itself, but it is of only limited interest in a book supposedly about a cat. The book really needed to decide its focus from the beginning, and state it honestly. The idea came from Vicki Myron, but it was either ghost-written or developed into a full-length book by Bret Witter. It feels very much as though it was artificially expanded. On his writer's page Bret Witter describes himself as, \"a full-time professional writer who specializes in contemporary nonfiction, usually working with a co-author to tell their inspiring true story\" which also goes a long way to explain the occasional lapses into sentimental schmaltz, such as, \"Is that what Iowa is all about? Maybe the heartland isn't just the place in the middle of the country; maybe it's also the place in the middle of your chest.\" Unfortunately there's quite a lot of that tweeness. Pure corn. (With apologies to Iowa's farming industry for the pun.) This reader has a sneaky suspicion that the \"saviour\" side of Dewey is overly stressed to fit the role he is cast in to save this small town and its people. I've no doubt he was popular, and all cats have their unique special abilities, but \"touched the world\" ? There are sequels too, which is probably primarily a business decision. The material here about Dewey would have been better presented as a short book - and been far more entertaining too. My local library also has a cat. I almost fell over him one morning when I went through the main door; he was lapping at a saucer of milk. Sometimes I find him asleep in the children's section, next to the radiator. He's also a ginger cat, similar to Dewey. This book is worth buying for the cover alone, which has a beautiful picture of Dewey in his prime. I love cats, and reading about animals, providing the book is not overly twee. But this book does not do what it says on the tin. ...more Ignore the \"to-read\" following \"never-got-to-the-last-page.\" Only 210 more pages to go the distance and earn the right to give one star to DEWEY -- but I left the ring.

When I hated grading freshman compositions, but before they started giving me chest pains (diagnosed as unexpressed anger), a friend showed me Richard Armour's \"Lines Long After Pope, By a Reader of Freshman Themes.\" These few lines drove thirty-two years (not as long as a quick trip to Iowa seemed to take) from subconscious to conscious territory so that, by Chapter 7 of DEWEY, I could mumble: \"Small wit is theirs,/ in shopworn phrases dressed,/ what oft was thought/ and twice as well expressed.\" I had been told that I would love DEWEY. Because I love cats??? I didn't need more reasons to believe that it's good to expect nothing and be grateful for anything acceptable, but I now have something else to confirm that belief. If, as Alexander Pope proposed, \"True Wit is Nature to advantage dressed,/ What oft was thought, but ne'er so well expressed\" (\"An Essay on Criticism\" II.297-98), Vicki Myron (with Bret Witter) deserves the Half-Wit Award for getting the part about dressing up Nature. With characters making comments such as \"Where there's a will, there's a way\"(45),though, you think, \"Richard Armour, your freshmen graduated and went on to write DEWEY: THE SMALL-TOWN CAT WHO TOUCHED THE WORLD.

He arrived in a library chute on a bitterly frigid January morning. He was a cute and clever cat. And he made many friends along the way \"dew\" to his pleasant personality. All of these make for a wonderful story. And yes, I cried at the (predictable) ending. But the whole story was told in an almost too-saccharin-y way, for me.

My only complaint, and the only thing that makes this 4 and not 5 stars, was that the writing style was frustrating in spots. Specifically, the person transcribing what Vicki said seemed to plan to return to certain topics, and then never did. There were several points at which the phrasing led you to believe that something would happen and it didn't. Things like (this isn't in the book, just an example of the sort of thing I mean) \"Little did I know that this would just be the beginning...\" followed by no elaboration on the topic. At first it was just a little distracting, but by the end it got annoying. The flow just seemed a bit random. But what the book lacked in cohesiveness, it made up for in heart, definitely. ...more This book is in some serious need of editing. The anecdotes about Dewey were cute, but the long winded history of small town Iowa and the author were too much for me. I didn't finish this book and I wish I had the two hours back that I gave to it. This book turned out to be about more than a cute cat. I also learned a lot about corn, family farms, farming and small towns, as well as about the author. She tries to stay out of the book, but that is a difficult task.

It should have appealed to bedtime me \u2013 I am completely besotted with cats, and with libraries for that matter..... but it didn\u2019t. The book was deeply earnest in tone. There were two dissonant threads, firstly, a story about a wonderful cat, and secondly, the story of the sad life (blighted by various tragedies), of the woman who ran the library, and looked after Dewey. This librarian was fantastically brave throughout all her negative experiences, but they pealed like a gong throughout the book. For me her distresses detracted from Dewey\u2019s story. (I know that's an awful thing to say, but they did....) I was also let down in that Dewey the cat didn\u2019t really come alive for me. There were several occasions where I could have found myself dabbing my eyes with tissues and aww-ing at Dewey\u2019s adorableness, but this didn\u2019t happen. Instead we were given lots of statistics to prove his lovability (e.g. when people were asked to choose a name for him, hundreds responded, and when he died the librarian received more than a thousand emails conveying sympathy), but this was proof from the outside. I wanted proof in my heart, and it never happened. I never experienced Dewey\u2019s wonderfulness for myself. Judging by the statistics, and descriptions of Dewey\u2019s behaviour, he really was a very exceptional cat, loved by many people\u2026but I never really felt it for myself. I feel a mean and horrible person for not liking this book more. 25,689 people have rated it here at Goodreads (now that is a phenomenal number of people!) with an average rating of 3.77.... but it just didn\u2019t turn me on. ...more 2.5 Dewey's adorable; the story of his odds-beating survival, rescue, and world domination through cat charm is pretty great. I love cats! I love libraries! What went wrong?

As pets often do. The parts of this book concerning Dewey's routines and habits were overly cute. I adored reading about Dewey's quest for rubber bands and his ability to locate and to fall asleep in every open drawer, cupboard or empty box he could find. Cats are cute. And Dewey is no exception to this rule. But, the way this book is written is tedious. Myron constantly tells the reader that she knows, what Dewey is thinking. And not in a fun, trying-to-figure-out-what-the-cat-is-thinking-way. No. In a obnoxious, overbearing and much too selfreasurring way. An example: \u201c He regarded it as his job to make the library a place where people could be happy \u201d. Myron forcer her own sense of higher purpose on a cat in order to give him a noble cause. But who says that Dewey didn't regard it as his job to purr and to sleep all day? At other times, the book reads as written by an 8-year old. Myron observes how Dewey is around everyone else and smugly notes, that they think they have a special relationsship with Dewey even though he treats everyone the same. Her point is that Dewey is generally good and loves everyone equally, and she laughs at those endearingly naive people thinking that they are something special. But of course, Myron reaffirms, her own relationsship with Dewey is special. Dewey loves her the most, and while that may be true (she does serve him his food, after all), it is tedious to read about. I felt like part of the story was narrated by a jealous little child. This book is also interwoven with personal anecdotes from Myron's own life as well as long tirades on Iowa's economy and beautiful landscapes. Not only was it pointless to read, it was also painfully bad written. And worst of all, I didn't care. I only wanted the cute cat anecdotes. ...more This book has irritated and disappointed me so much that I'm taking a few minutes to bash it. I first saw \"Dewey\" in a book store before Christmas.

That first page was one of the best descriptions of Iowa I've read -- it perfectly summarized how I feel about my home state. \"There is a thousand mile table of land in the middle of the United States, between the Mississippi River on the East and the deserts on the West. Out here, there are rolling hills, but no mountains. There are rivers and creeks, but few large lakes. The wind has worn down the rock outcroppings, turning them first to dust, then dirt, then soil, and finally to fine black farmland. Out here, the roads are straight, stretching to the horizon in long, unbroken lines. There are no corners, only occasional, almost imperceptible bends. This land was surveyed and plotted for farms; the bends are corrections in the survey line. Exactly every mile, every road is intersected by another almost perfectly straight road. Inside is a square mile of farmland. Take a million of those square miles, lace them together, and you have one of the most important agricultural regions in the world. The Great Plains. The Bread Basket. The Heartland. Or as many people think of it, the place you fly over on your way to somewhere else. Let them have the oceans and mountains, their beaches and their ski resorts. I\u2019ll take Iowa.\" Great paragraph, right? Well, enjoy it, because it's the last great graph in the book. So, I finally get the book from the library, and I'm happy to read about this cat that got abandoned in a library book slot in a small Iowa town. By this time, the book is a full-fledged bestseller, so I'm optimistic. Sadly, the book quickly degenerates into a recount of every cute thing the damn cat ever did. Remember the time Dewey chewed on some rubber bands? Or how about the time he crawled into the lap of a Grumpy Old Man and made him smile? Gee whiz, that cat sure is cute! Gag, and gag again. I read about 30 pages, and then I started skimming, hoping it would improve. Soon, I couldn't even handle skimming the stories, because the writing style was so childish and grating. This book seems to be written for an 8-year-old girl who loves cats, but it mistakenly got put on the Adult Nonfiction shelf. I will grant that there is a good two-page explanation on the Farm Crisis of the 1980s, and how it devastated so many Iowa families. The writer thinks the farm crisis boosted Dewey's popularity in the town, because he cheered up so many people during a tough time. That may be true, but there doesn't need to be 288 pages on how cute this one library cat was. And I'm sure that one of the reasons this book is so popular now is because there is another financial crisis, and people apparently want sentimental pap to cheer them up. ...more This is a book that any cat lover with fall in love with.

I also enjoyed reading about some of the history of Spencer library and about Vicki's own personal life. Though she did save Dewey that day he repaid her over and over again with his love.

And while I dislike the \"We're so awesome because we're not arrogant at all\"-attitude the author tries to put across, the love for her state shines through, and that has to be worth some bonus points. Also, there is a lot that I didn't know about American libraries (Apparently a library in a place not even a sixth of the size of my university town has got an amount of staff large enough to separate into groups of people who don't speak to each other! And they have return boxes where you can leave your stuff during the night! For me things like these were fascinating!) Also, the cat on the cover (i.e. the one who touched the world) is rather cute. Now for the bad news, responsible for the 2-star-rating and my being almost unable to finish the thing: WOMEN LIKE THE AUTHOR ARE THE REASON WHY SOME PEOPLE HATE CATS AND THEIR OWNERS!!! Seriously, I thought I would throw the book against a wall if I had to read one more passage stating \"You could see that Dewey was thinking about the time when...\" or \"Dewey knew everything would turn out well\" or \"He could share my thoughts\" or even \"He regarded it as his job to make the library a place where people could be happy\". This is a cat , not a human. A cat should be treated like a cat ! It doesn't want to do a good job! I don't doubt that a cat will come to you if you are depressed, because cats can sense that and will help you get over it. But there is a line between sensitive cats and schmaltz. At least there should be ... And also ... I WOULD NEVER EVER EVER GIVE HER MY CAT! NOT FOR ONE DAY!!! Do you know what she does when she finds the poor, cold, hungry little creature? - No. She puts him in a bath and shampoos it. ( Shampoos!!! ) And if Dewey does take time out from \"his job\", and he starts eating rubber bands, does she immediately ban the things from the area? - No. What then follows is a textbook example of 'How not to train your cat', including 'tease it until it is annoyed with you because that is fun, and it won't mind at all'. --- I'm not saying that the staff at the library treated the cat badly. Otherwise he could not have lived for as long as he did, or been as outgoing as he was. But if anyone behaved normally with the cat, the author fails to mention it in the book. To be absolutely honest, while I did enjoy the information about Iowa, I could not recommend this to anyone, least of all cat people who have retained a shred of sanity. ...more I have to admit, I cried and I laughed, and I could not have read this book on the bus or while waiting for an appointment.

The author, a library manager, tells of her small town in Iowa and how a cat influenced a whole town during a difficult economic time (and beyond). She tells her own story too, and doesn't shy away from difficult or dark events that occurred in her family, such as severe alcoholism, suicide, and illness. In fact, illness touches the author's own life and Dewey's as well. It was encouraging to me to see that she accomplished so much despite her limitations, and to see how much Dewey accomplished, just by showing a little compassion and affection (and yes, I think cats CAN show compassion). My two cats were both grumpy old men, but my family had a cat who, like Dewey, lived to love. He was affectionate, easy-going, and social (he even brought other neighborhood cats over to play). How is it that a cat can succeed at the important stuff and I struggle to do so? Perhaps that question (unspoken) was partly what caused Dewey to become so widely known. Perhaps he reminded people of what really matters.

Dewey was a lovely kitty, no doubt about it, but his stories though sweet and cute were not all that interesting to read about. I\u2019ve witnessed most of Dewey\u2019s antics, especially the telepathic thing, with my own pets. I swear they can read our minds. Except for my Labrador. He\u2019s a bit of lunkhead. I don\u2019t know, maybe it was just the way the author had of telling the story that I didn\u2019t enjoy. The telling wasn\u2019t as emotional to me as I think it could have been. Maybe I no longer have a heart? Yeah, that\u2019s probably it. Still, reading this book makes me want to open a used book store and populate it with a few homeless kitties.
