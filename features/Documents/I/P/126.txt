This is not a novel, it is a collection of similes and metaphors, most of which do not make sense. I originally gave <+++>Shatter Me</+++> two stars because that's my sort of kneejerk reaction to books I don't like, but after thinking it over for a while, I can't recall anything positive about it that would justify a rating of more than one star. You're probably assuming - correctly - that I went into this book with low expectations. This is completely true. Any so-called \"dystopia\" with a runway model on the front cover leaves me feeling sceptical. However, I was also prepared to allow myself to be surprised; a lot of my friends loved this and one of the biggest criticisms didn't actually bother me - purple prose. I think there's a fine line in writing between the pretty and the purplish and different readers will define it in their own way. For example, some reviewers thought that Lips Touch: Three Times was just a mess of bloated purple prose, whereas I thought it was one of the most beautiful books I read last year. I have a high tolerance level for flowery writing. But... Shatter Me 's numerous metaphors, similes, and endless descriptions just didn't make sense. What is this?: \"Hate looks like everybody else until it smiles. Until it spins around and lies with lips and teeth carved into semblance of something too passive to punch.\" I just... WHAT??? This is one example floating around in there, but every second sentence is like this! That's not even mentioning the annoying strike-outs. Trust me,<---M> no really</---M>, trust me , I thought people were being overly picky when they said the crossed out sentences were annoying. I actually thought it sounded interesting, unusual, especially because the whole thing is meant to be written in a notebook and I cross stuff out in mine all the time. But you have no idea how bloody annoying this is to read. All the effin' time. People didn't exaggerate: it will most likely drive you crazy. However, there was one thing that for me was even more annoying than the descriptions, the similes, the strikes, and that was the stupid repetition thing: \"and then and then and then...\" Again, if it had been used once, or sparingly even, then it wouldn't be so bad. I may have thought it was an interesting literary technique. But Shatter Me had way way way too much of everything (<---B>see what I did there?</---B>). And story? What story? *sigh* It's about time we just opened up an entirely new genre called \"Dystopian Romance\" or alternatively \"Romantic Dystopia\", though I don't wish to be pessimistic, I'm pretty sure half the new releases of 2012 will make it into that category. If there was a story then it drowned amidst the waves of overenthusiastic and flowery prose. This reminded me of Article 5 in that the dystopia was there to make the romance interesting. One was certainly there to complement the other, but it was the wrong way around. Also... kissing when you are fleeing for your lives?? I'm sure this is not the correct way of things, right? And yet it occurs in way too many young adult books. I'm like: \"run, run, run!\" but the characters are too busy swapping saliva. I must be old-fashioned in my thinking that staying alive is kinda important. There are a lot of things that, had they been there, could have convinced me to up this to two stars. One star ratings make me feel sucky. But I'm sorry guys, I wasn't even entertained. The beginning was intriguing but there was so little plot beyond the romance that it quickly became tedious. I hated the prose, I felt nothing either way for the characters, this series ends here for me. ...more Oh, friend. Recommend me a book that is good.

ERMAHGERD READ SHATTER ME ! I know many people found this book to be oh so romantic, but I can't help but think how gross it was. The writing : Mafi's style of writing varies. Let me categorize. This doesn't even make sense writing : \"I catch the rose petals as they fall from my cheeks, as they float around the frame of my body, as they cover me in something that feels like the absence of courage.\" \"He says it with a small smile the size of Jupiter.\" I'm picturing this in my head and it's not pretty writing : \"Every organ in my body falls to the ground.\" \"There are 400 cotton balls caught in my windpipe.\" \"My mouth is sitting on my kneecaps.\" \"My jaw is dangling from my shoelace.\" \"My stomach drops onto my knees.\" \"I blush through my bones.\" \"My spine is conducting enough electricity to power a city.\" Repetition gone wrong writing : \"I blush.\" \"I blush.\" \"His lips part. Close.\" \"I blush.\" \"I blush.\" \"His lips part. Close.\" \"I blush.\" \"I blush.\" \"His lips part. Close.\" Really just shit writing in general writing : \"I am an old creaky staircase when I wake up.\" \"Warner thinks Adam is a cardboard cutout of vanilla regurgitations.\" Do I need to explain how shitty this writing is? The characters : Juliette does nothing but sulk around, wait for death, whine, and has very creepy thoughts of Adam. Adam is just there... Warner is a pathetic excuse for a villain. I must admit that a few times, he had potential to be a good character. I thought he was the only character that actually had a purpose. He made me cringe with his insanity. He made me angry, made me feel uncomfortable. He was getting there. Then he would say something so cheesy, so inconsistent to his character, and just downright stupid that I lost all hope in him. Kenji was just fucking annoying. The plot : Besides Juliette's constant whining and lameness and the cringeworthy romances, this story was just a sadder and lamer version of X-Men. I had too many X-Men vibes going on. On the whole : Mafi, if you wanted to capture me with I'm just trying way too hard to sound cool unique prose, thinking that if you repeated phrases fifty times every once in a while, had painful metaphors, and an unnecessary abundance of irritating striking texts, then *reads acknowledgments* You've filled my days with shooting stars, and one day I will pluck the moon from the sky and put it in your mailbox.

Original fan-girl praise (because I am incapable of actually writing a true unbiased, unaffected review for this series): Okay, I have not properly reviewed this series since I read it a year ago (and I don't think I ever can because it would be ridiculously long and the book is so quotable that I would literally be citing the entire thing) but Shatter Me is one of my favorite series of ALL TIME. And it has my FAVORITE LOVE INTEREST of ANY BOOK I'VE EVER READ. Butttt, to anyone considering it, watch this: http://youtu.be/dJt-lGmBSTs . I just found that fan video the other day and I can't stop watching it. I'm sorry but if that doesn't make you want to read this book you do not have a soul. READ. THIS. BOOK.

It also introduced me to the entire concept of purple prose. Prose can be beautiful. I\u2019ve read plenty of books where the writing touches me deeply and the author is simply writing about the sunset, or a walk in the park, or the plight of the poor. If the author is able to actually tell a story without distracting the reader with the prose, I\u2019m all for it. That is not the case with \u201cShatter Me\u201d. \u201cShatter Me\u201d was like my first attempt at cooking a turkey over-done. It was like climbing Mount Everest tiring, watching kids play outside your window while you are taking a test distracting, and my dog throwing his bone at me silly. At some point, I was drowning, desperately searching for land overwhelmed by the prose and eager for the story. And don\u2019t get me started about the crossing out of passages in the book. It was irritating, annoying stupid a cheap trick dumb, something I did not enjoy. Overall- I won\u2019t read the next book. I might read the next book if I get a free copy. I\u2019m curious to see where the author can go since it is clear that she can write. I think someone needed to put a leash on the over playful puppy edit her prose down to a more controllable level so that people could enjoy the story rather than cringe with every every every regurgitation eruption spewing listen you need to stop crossing me off or I\u2019m gonna sick some nasty virus on your ass incident of prose. ...more Shatter Me, otherwise known as: When Creative Writing Class Goes Wrong.

I don\u2019t think the effect works or is done par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlarly well. I think the work\u00adings of a trou\u00adbled mind would result in more than bad analo\u00adgies and a bunch of num\u00adbers. Despite the fact that Juliette\u2019s back\u00adstory and premise is inter\u00adest\u00ading, we still end up with the same mun\u00addane, cookie-cutter hero\u00adine that can be seen in the vast major\u00adity of Young Adult lit\u00ader\u00ada\u00adture. The only thing insane about this novel is how pre\u00addictable and trite it is.

The entire premise of Shat\u00adter Me promised some\u00adthing dif\u00adfer\u00adent and new. Yet we still end up with the same bland old fare. The plot and pac\u00ading is awk\u00adward and cum\u00adber\u00adsome. Even when sit\u00adu\u00ada\u00adtions are sup\u00adposed to be tense, there is a sense of bore\u00addom and pre\u00addictabil\u00adity.

Let me translate what Mafi was trying to say; \"It was raining.\" This is one of, if not THE major problem of Shatter Me ; she tries too hard to be clever and poetic and the story gets muddied along the way. I apologize for not going more in depth with this review, but I read this book over three months ago now and all I remember is that I hated it and it was incredibly poorly written. I think my status updates should show this pretty clearly, but to make this easier to see, I've decided to write this somewhat brief review and sort through a few of my updates as well. A device Mafi chooses to use early on is crossing striking out the words that \"crazy\" Juliette is \"really\" thinking. As the story goes on this device gets used less and less and so it feels more like Mafi just used it in the beginning for fun and to make her book look different from the rest of the young adult books out there, which, unfortunately, it is NOT, especially when you get to the romance. And that is what this story is: a romance , and a disgustingly sappy one at that. I don't think you'll be able to believe these favorite quotes of mine until you read them for yourself: \"I'd like to cry into his eyes.\" \"His body presses closer and I realize I'm paying attention to nothing but the dandelions blowing wishes in my lungs.\" \"I'm suddenly desperate to drink in every drop of his being, desperate to savor every moment I've never known before. I suddenly worry that there's an expiration date on this phenomenon. The possibility of losing him The possibility of losing him The possibility of losing him is 100 years of solitude I don't want to imagine. Realization is a pendulum the size of the moon. It won't stop slamming into me.\" \"His heart is racing so fast I can't distinguish it from my own. It's 5,000 degrees in the air between us.\" \"I've run out of words. My pockets are full of letters I can't string together.\" \"I want to fall asleep to the sound of his heart beating in the atmosphere.\" \"His eyes are a midnight moment filled with memories, the only windows into my world.\" \"My heart fails for a moment. There are 400 cotton balls caught in my windpipe.\" \"James and Adam glance back at me and I melt into pink Play-Doh.\" \"I'm up. Spinning. Scanning. Scared. They found us is the only thing I can think of. My stomach is a flimsy crepe, my heart a raging woodpecker, my blood a river of anxiety.\" \"It's raining today. The sky is weeping for us.\" \"His lips are spelling secrets and my ears are spilling ink, staining my skin with his stories.\" \"The sun is revolving around the moon when he responds.\" \"I offer him a smile. Try to keep my organs from falling out. Hope the holes in my head aren't showing.\" \"My mouth is sitting on my kneecaps.\" \"My neck snaps up to meet his dark eyes, his smooth voice, silky and strong.\" \"My jaw is dangling from my shoelace.\" \"I'm blushing through my bones.\" \"Adam pulls back just a tiny bit. Kisses my bottom lip. Bites it for just a second. His skin is 100 degrees hotter than it was a moment ago. His lips are pressed against my neck and my hands are on a journey down his upper body and I'm wondering why there are so many freight trains in my heart, why his chest is a broken harmonica.\" And that, my friends, is that. I thought it was awful. Even if I didn't think the writing was trite and overwrought, later on it really starts to feel like she's borrowing heavily from the X-Men mythos (even though she claims she's never even seen the movies.) If you read the few quotes I've listed above and they're not your cup of tea, I'd say skip this one and try something else. Or maybe watch one of the X-Men movies instead; you'll get a much better portrayal of Rogue and a steamier love story. Mmm ... Wolverine. ...more This book was just awful . Awful.

Until one day a neighbor took the first strike in the Great Garage Sale of the Noughties, and my sister bought an Ingrid Bergman boxed set. There were five rotting monkey brains movies in that boxed set. She sits me down the following Sunday, or rather she catches me at my weakest: coming back from a pox. She grabs The Inn of the Sixth Happiness , jams it into the DVD player and I'm forced to watch what I can only describe as three hours of Rogers and Hammerstien on crack (without any of the ridiculously hilarious lyrics). This book still takes the cake. It's obnoxiously written. Which is a shame; in blogerto, Tahereh is an enormously cool and entertaining person. Was this the work of a dastardly ghost writer? I almost hope it was. I know most of the best bad quotes have already been recanted by several other dear reviewers, but I'd feel unfulfilled if I didn't just refresh your memory: \"Summer...promises a million happy adjectives only to pour stench and sewage into your nose for dinner\" (p.26) Okay. I understand the stench and sewage part, and the million happy adjectives. But why for dinner? Why dinner? Why that one meal? Ms. Mafi, honey, I've been in this place. I've been in a place where, as a writer, you feel the desperate fanfictionesque need to tack on fancy-dancy meaningless words to give your sentences mystical rhythm, but there comes a point where you have to stop that. Stop it forever. \"I hate the lackadaisical ennui of a sun too preoccupied with itself to notice the infinite hours we spend in its presence\" (p.26) No comment. Except that it's one sentence away from the smelly dinner thing. \"My eyes are 2 professional pickpockets, stealing everything to store away in my mind\" (p.61) Wait, what? \"The sky is raining bricks right into my skull\" (p. 70) I have a thing about this. The words \"brain\" and \"skull\" are too often used in teenage-girl narratives to describe thought process. Granted, I've used them myself in YA narrative; but with a certain character. A character such as Juliette who is clearly a dreamer and an artistic type (yeah, okay, bear with me, will you?) would most likely not use such clinical terms as \"brain\" and \"skull\" to relate to her thoughts. When I consider my thoughts, I relate them to my mind. When I consider my body and the scientific part of what I am, I consider the brain and skull. Thus, \"brain\" and \"skull\" are simply unrealistic words for a character such as Juliette to use in her narrative. [example: Kira from Partials is a scientist. Therefore, she is more likely to use \"brain\" and \"skull\" in her fleeting point. Grace from Shiver reads poetry and plays bocce ball with wolves, therefore she is not a clinical thinker and would not use \"brain\" and \"skull\" in her natural narrative. Capiche?] \"Hate looks just like everybody else until it smiles. Until it spins around and lies with lips and teeth carved into the semblance of something too passive to punch\" (p.73) Oh, honey. What happened here, hm? \"He begins to pull off his gloves and I begin to panic...my jaw is too tight and my teeth have begun to ache\" (p.78) This morning, I began to begin, because the beginning is where everything began. Later, when I began to dine, my mother began to yell for my beginning to eat before my sister had begun to sit down. \"[Adam's eyes are] 2 buckets of river water at midnight\" (p.113) Is it just me, or does anybody else find the image of that extremely unappealing? \"My eyes are fighting not to flutter My legs have won the right to tremble\" (116) This sounds like some kind of seizure. Instead of dry-humping Juliette in the shower, maybe Adam should be calling for an ambulance and putting a towel under her head! \"He says it with a small smile the size of Jupiter\" (p.119) Okay...you do know that Jupiter is the largest object in the solar system, besides the sun? \"I feel the sudden urge to rupture his spleen\" (p.132) Again with the clinical language! NAO. \"Warner thinks Adam is a cardboard cutout of vanilla regurgitations\" (p.164) Warner is absolutely right. \"James and Adam glance back at me and I melt into pink Play-Doh\" (p.234) I'm not even going to dignify that with a comment. \"My jaw is dangling from my shoelace\" (p.310) Sounds like a scene from Saw . Like I just said in that long-winded point-reference-comment passage, the writing in this book is just abysmal. It wants to be all deep and metaphorical and Bronte, but it's just a giant mess. Of the hot variety. To match this sordid writing is a truly terrible heroine. Juliette is pitiful. Absolutely pitiful. She is already on her knees in screaming horror on page 65 because the guy she met a maximum of 48 hours ago 'betrayed' her. What the fuck? The instalove in this book is worse than Halo . I'm not kidding. I'm honestly not. She's making out with him in the fucking shower by page 116. What? WHAT? I'm really struggling to find anything to say about Juliette. She has no personality. No quirks, no little habits (except striking out words, but Mafi noticeably runs out of steam with that little gimmick around page 100) and absolutely no traits that warrant my sympathy. This girl is such a shell that I didn't even care that she'd been locked up for however many days in a cell. I cared less than I did when Jane Fonda looked like a 20-year-old on the red carpet last week. At least that elicited a, \"No! Really?\" There's also no point in even touching the romance in this book. It's instalove, and written badly. What more is there to say? Oh, there is more. This book is not a dystopian. Bananas in Pajamas was more dystopian than this book. No shit. This book is a romance, worthy of Harlequin. There's no plot behind all the kissing and his lips his lips his lips and the 400 cotton balls someone inexplicably jammed down Juliette's windpipe, probably in a vain attempt to end the monologuing that plagues this book like The Blob. It's just intolerable. It's like reading the weepy little diary of those kids who brush their hair over their eyes and pretend to like Korn cuz nobody gets them, yo. It's the Sisterhood of the Snivelling Emo. It makes me want to scream. So, where was I? Dystopian? SHH! Orwell and Huxley might hear you, dammit! The only decent thing in the entire universe of this book was the banter between Kenji and Winston, whom I now ship. They're the only characters in this book worth giving a flying fuck about. In fact, I wish the book were about them and nobody else. Castle was a very sad attempt at Professor X. And just stop right there. Because you can't be Professor X. Nobody can. James McAvoy, I heart you. I'm already tired of writing this review. See what this book does to you? It's just the biggest time-waster ever. And you just know that in the next book, Unravel Me , Juliette is going to question her love for Adam and go back and forth between Warner, because she conveniently missed the kill shot here, even though she was five inches away from him. But what the heck, right? Everybody knows it's only logical to shut your eyes when you're firing a gun . Did I mention that Juliette is one of the stupidest YA heroines to date? No? Yes? No? Well, I'm mentioning it now. Juliette, you are one of the stupidest YA heroines to date. My conclusion? This book is a sloppy, shoddy mess and a very sad attempt at bandwagon-jumping the dystopian trend right now. Every so often you find a great brand-new YA dystopian read, but those worthwhile tales (think Unwind ) are swallowed by the growing number of trashy, tasteless, stupid and lacklustre titles like this one. It's sad to say, but it's true: books like this cheapen the dystopian genre. They have brought it to its knees. That is all. ...more \u201cI always wonder about raindrops.

But I've sort of accepted that book one is always going to be slightly uncomfortable to reread just because of the fact that so much has changed by book 3 that this is almost cringe-worthy. There's so much set-up for world building that never occurs. Honestly this book is more of a 3 star rating, but I can't bring myself to lower it. It was due for a reread since it had been just about two years, and, like always, I noted several things that I had missed or forgotten since I read it last! 8/27/15: I'm not quite sure why i've never uploaded a review on goodreads for this book. I mean, I feel like it kind of goes without saying how I feel about it but ya know. This is my favorite series. If you're sick of dystopian and never want to read one ever again, make an exception for this one. Ignore the fact that the entire fandom (and myself) have probably majorly spoiled you. But this book. Holy shit. The writing. YES. The characters. YES. The plot. YES. The range of emotions. YES. I could tell you the things wrong with it, but no book is perfect. But if you want a book with characters that you will not be able to get out of your head and with a plot that will have you reading an entire trilogy in one sitting, this book is your friend. reread: July 2014 ...more Okay, I feel a little bit bad giving this book a one-star review, for several reasons: a) I won it from a blog giveaway.

But, oh well. b) The author is only 24, so she's probably still got a lot to learn. c) The author is also Muslim, and apparently a lot of Muslims have not taken this book well. Another Goodreads reviewer, Skyla, was apparently lectured by Muslims for reading this book in public, because it's offensive to their religion ... not sure why. I guess because of the somewhat sexual parts? (You can read Skyla's review here .) I guess if she knew it would offend people of her religion, that was a pretty ballsy move to make. So, props for that? Otherwise, I don't feel much remorse, considering I really, really did not care for this book. By the time I reached the end, I kind of felt like there was smoke coming out my ears because it had frustrated me so much. Then I had to go downstairs and eat pancakes and rant to my mom so I would feel better. Basically, a book has not annoyed me so much since I read Halo . And if you've read my review of that book , you know how strongly I disliked it. *Lets out a long sigh* So, here we go. Shatter Me is another boring paranormal romance dystopian story concerning a teenage girl named Juliette. For almost a year, she's been kept in captivity because her touch is lethal and thus, obviously, rather dangerous. Then a boy is thrown into her cell with her\u2013\u2013a boy named Adam, whom she happens to have a history with. In a confusing turn of events, this leads to Juliette being taken to some creepy facility where a creepy guy named Warner wants to use her as a weapon. So, I see how this could be a cool story. The idea of having a lethal touch is intriguing (*coughs* although I guess I'm biased because I've used it in one of my own stories). And I like the idea of evil people trying to take Juliette and use her as a weapon. A bit clich\u00e9d I guess, but you know ... it makes sense. Unfortunately, there were a lot of things in this book that really did not work. 1. The writing. I could go on and on about all the issues I had with the writing. I think it was actually one of the most pretentious styles I've ever seen. I can take bad writing to a certain extent, but the one thing I can't stand is a style that tries to be really original and poetic and ... it just doesn't work out. First of all, there was the use of strikethroughs. What Mafi did was, she would have Juliette narrating but her actual thoughts would be crossed out like this . All right, so I guess it's kind of a cool technique and something I haven't seen before. So, at least she tried to be original. The problem was, she used it so often and so needlessly that in the end, it was nothing but a gimmick. Plus trying to read so many crossed out things is kind of a pain, isn't it? Then there was the repetition repetition repetition. It reminded me of how I used to have this old computer program called ELIZA. And it was like this \"computer therapist\" that you would type messages to and then it would respond. And if you said the same thing over and over it would respond, \"This is getting annoying annoying annoying. See what I mean?\" And that's exactly what I kept thinking about. First of all, it was the repetition of descriptions. Especially that God damn description of this white bird Juliette kept imagining out her window. It would be like, \"There will be a white bird. It will have a golden head. It will fly.\" By the time she mentioned this imaginary bird for about the third time, using the exact same words over and over again , I just couldn't take it anymore. Not only that, but she had a habit of repeating random words words words in the middle of sentences three times times times. And there was absolutely no point to it. At all. For example, there was a part where Mafi wrote, \"James was sound sound sound asleep.\" Um, okay. Can you just write, \"James was sound asleep\" ? What's wrong with doing that? Repeating \"sound\" three times doesn't make him any more or less asleep. We get it. He's asleep. Please, just say that. Because right now, you just seem like this: Then, there were the metaphors that made no sense whatsoever. Here are a couple, just to give examples: \"He leans back against the couch. Runs a free hand over his face. Seasons change. Stars explode. Someone is walking on the moon.\" Just, what ? What is this even supposed to signify? So, he sits a couch. He runs his hand over his face. What is this random stuff about seasons changing and stars exploding and someone walking on the moon? I guess maybe she's saying that there's a really long pause but ... in that case, why randomly mention someone on the moon? And why could she have just said it in a simpler, much less distracting way? \"and I\u2019m wondering why there are so many freight trains in my heart, why his chest is a broken harmonica.\" Once again ... sure, this is an original description. I mean, I'm pretty sure I'll never see this description in a book ever again. Granted, that's mostly because it doesn't even make sense. It's like, she just threw a bunch of words together and hoped someone would think it was symbolic. But really, what is this even saying? Because all I can picture is that her heart is making a sound like a train whistle and his chest is making weird musical noises. In which case, they both need to get those things checked out. Right now. That does not sound one bit healthy. \u201c'It\u2019s all your fault! It\u2019s your fault, you worthless piece of shit,' his father screamed over and over and over again until I threw up right there, all over a patch of dandelions.\" Haha okay, this isn't even a metaphor. But I just had to include it because ... well, just read it again. That's a description you'll never forget. And this part is supposed to be some intense, emotional moment when Juliette is remembering a time she saw Adam got beaten up by his alcoholic father. So yeah, that should be disturbing. And instead, it made me have a hysterical laughing fit. I mean, her throwing up is a bit melodramatic, eh? It just comes out of nowhere. And if that wasn't bad enough ... why the heck does it have to be on a patch of dandelions? Why? It just totally ruins the mood. 2. The total lack of world-building. And explaining things in general. Practically nothing was explained in this book. To begin with, Juliette's power (and the powers of other characters) was never explained. They just seemed to randomly have these supernatural abilities and there was no reason why. Maybe I missed something? But anyway. The biggest problem was that the author set this story in the future but never established a proper setting. Just how far in the future is this supposed to be? Why do people suddenly have random superpowers? What's with all the military rule and whatnot? None of these things are made clear. It ticks me off how so many YA authors are writing \"dystopian\" stories\u2013\u2013but really, they're still just writing paranormal romance and don't want to admit it. So they give it a \"futuristic\" setting where everything is mildly unpleasant, and suddenly it's a \"dystopia.\" If you're writing a real dystopia, you actually have to establish when/where/what it is. 3. All the \"conveniences.\" Ack, there were so many random coincidences in this book, it was impossible for me to suspend my disbelief. The most significant one was that both of Juliette's love interests were (for no reason whatsoever) the only people able to touch her. Because otherwise, it would have been oh-so-frustrating if both of them couldn't make out with her. *Eyeroll* Heck, even Adam's little brother pointed out that it was \"awfully convenient.\" If you have to make your 10-year-old character point out how ridiculous one of your plot devices is ... well, something's probably wrong. The second most significant convenience was Juliette's random super-strength. About halfway through the book, she suddenly discovered that she could crush concrete with her bare hands. Errrm okay. But then the thing was, she didn't ever take advantage of this power unless <---A>Tahereh Mafi</---A> obviously couldn't think of another way to get the characters out of a situation. (For example, when Juliette had to break Adam out of some prison cell.) But at times when Juliette really could have used this power, she just conveniently forgot it existed. For example, there was this scene where Warner started making out with Juliette. And then, she started kissing him back so she could distract him as she awkwardly reached into his shirt to get his gun so she could shoot him. So ... okay. I guess this might have made a little tiny bit of sense if say, she hadn't really wanted to kill him. But she later said that she hoped she'd shot him in the heart and that he was dead. So, if she wanted to absolutely guarantee his death, why the hell didn't she just take his skull and crush it with her bare hands? Or snap his neck? Or throw him through a wall? She can freaking CRUSH CONCRETE WITH HER HANDS, for crying out loud! Then she wouldn't have had to get in all that awkward making-out business. Another random coincidence was that the stupid imaginary bird ended up being identical to a tattoo Adam had on his chest. Um ... okay. So a random figment of Juliette's imagination ended up being the same as a tattoo she had never seen before. And then she was like, \"Oooh, it's because you are my bird, and we shall fly away, and we shall be free.\" Yeah ... I think that's about all I can say about that. 4. Juliette is an absolute Mary Sue. I mean, she's pretty much the epitome of Mary Sue. (Just check out the Universal Mary-Sue Litmus Test if you have no idea what I'm talking about.) Juliette displays an alarming number of Mary Sue traits. - Everything with a penis is in love with her. - ... Including the villain. He is described as being \"obsessed\" with her. (This is typically a bad, bad sign.) - She has a fairly ordinary name that's spelled unusually. - She is given beautiful clothing to wear for no good reason, except basically so that she'll look sexy. - She randomly achieves superpowers. - She is outcast and despised by most people\u2013\u2013even though she has good intentions\u2013\u2013because of her powers. - ... Including her own family. - She considers her power to be a curse rather than an advantage, and doesn't miss a single opportunity to whine about it. - She constantly angsts about something she did in the past, even though it wasn't really her fault. (view spoiler) [And by the way, the way she killed that little boy was completely lame. The way she talked about it before she gave any details, I figured it had been something really dramatic. But, no. She saw a little boy fall down in a grocery store, tried to help him stand up, and he died. Even though she knew that her touch killed people. If she'd been trying to save the boy\u2013\u2013like, if he was about to fall off a cliff or get hit by a car or something, I understand why she might have risked touching him. But, that kid could have gotten up all by himself. And Juliette's only excuse was that the little boy's mom was neglecting him, and she felt bad because her own mother had neglected her. Oh, boohoo. That is totally worth killing a child over... (hide spoiler) ] 5. The S&M. Warner kept trying to make Juliette touch him. It was implied that Juliette got pleasure out of touching people and seeing them suffer. Enough said. 6. The insta-love. Juliette and Adam barely know each other. They knew of each other's existence when they were children, but they never actually talked. They barely talked when they were in a prison cell together, and that was only for a few days. They have a few conversations once they're at, um, that place with Warner and stuff. And then all of a sudden Adam is like, \"I LOVE YOU.\" So they spend the rest of the book making out with each other. No ... just no. I've written enough rants on why this is a problem in YA literature, and I don't feel like writing it again. But seriously, romances need to take time and be properly developed. Otherwise, they just feel fake and bland. Okay, I don't think I can go on any longer. Now my head just hurts and ... I think you get the idea. This book did not do it for me. From the writing to the characters to the plot, it was all just a mess that needed some serious total rewriting editing. Hopefully Mafi, being so young, will eventually learn how to actually use metaphors, create detailed worlds, and develop characters and their relationships. But, as for this series, the first book was a turn-off for me and I don't plan to read the next two.

In the absence of human relationships I formed bonds with paper characters. I lived love and loss through stories threaded in history; I experienced adolescence by association. My world is one interwoven web of words, stringing limb to limb, bone to sinew, thoughts and images all together. I am a being comprised of letters, a character created by sentences, a figment of imagination formed through fiction.\u201d Adam is a character that I liked, but it took me a while to love him, I liked more in the end, in the action scenes, but for others things I consider him as the typical hero of the story, quite stereotype, handsome boy, who saves te girl and I don't know yet I'm not convinced about it. But I have faith on him, and I hope revelations for this character , maybe change my mind :) \u201cHis lips soften into a smile that cracks apart my spine. He repeats my name like the word amuses him. Entertains him. Delights him. In seventeen years no one has said my name like that\u201d Warner is my love lol, I feel a great connection with this character, it is dark and hides a mystery that catches my attention. It is so interesting and sexy , I'm dying to know more of its history, really, I know it is something perverse in this book but you can't deny that his scenes with Juliette are INCREDIBLE. High Voltage guys!,even when only they speak to each other. So Good! . I don't know how she resists to him! \u201cHis smile is laced with dynamite. \"Go to sleep\" \"Go to hell.\" He works his jaw. Walks to the door. \"I'm working on it.\u201d So I'm dying to continue the story I loved it, especially the last pages and the plot twist has surprised me !. I love the whole powers thing . Very clever twist! YAY!. ...more (Note: Goodreads friends and followers, you know me by now.

Instead, my reviews are...chronicles of the experiences I had with books, and if that can help you decide whether certain books will be for you or not, then I'll be all the happier. However, sometimes I am a gushing mess with books I love, and I don't note the flaws present. I will try to be mindful of this tendency of mine as I write this review.) Hope is hugging me, holding me in its arms, wiping away my tears and telling me that today and tomorrow and two days from now I will be just fine and I'm so delirious I actually dare to believe it. Two years ago, I had my first experience with a young adult dystopian novel: Suzanne Collins's The Hunger Games . I fell in love with the characters, found myself fascinated yet horrified by the circumstances of the world, and became invested in a wonderful story that still makes me feel a tangle of emotions to this day. In some respects, Tahereh Mafi 's Shatter Me gave me some of the same emotions I had back then as I stayed up to the wee hours of the morning just to read what happened next to Katniss, Peeta, and everyone else. Shatter Me left me expectant, worried, and intrigued with every page I turned. It was a stressful reading experience, definitely, but all the stress I felt was pent-up through the heroine, Juliette. Juliette, you see, hasn't been touched for 264 days. Inside of her is a curse gift that brings deathdeathdeath agony to anyone she touches, and this strange ability has led to her being locked away in an asylum. Isolation takes its toll on Juliette, and her only real solace is writing away in a notebook and spinning phrases in such a way that they seem overwrought and not entirely rational or \"normal.\" Then the unthinkable occurs: Juliette is given a cellmate, and everything she thought she knew begins to expand and spin out of her control entirely . Shatter Me is a dystopian novel but, unlike others of the genre, the novel is less about external conflict (though there is some of that; it wouldn't be a novel if there weren't) and more about internal conflict. To make my meaning more clear, let me explain with a comparison: one\u00a0of my friends recently directed me to a script called Maggie about a teenage girl bitten by a zombie and her slow change into one of the undead. What do zombies and one girl's transformation into one have to do with this novel? Because that script is about a big idea (zombie infestation worldwide) narrowed down to a character (Maggie) and her experiences. In some ways, Shatter Me , is much like that: it's about a big idea (a dystopian world headed by a secretive totalitarian government), but instead it focuses on one character's role in it (Juliette). Given how so many writers focus on the \"big ideas\" and sacrifice deep characterization because of it, I was very happy with the way this first novel developed, driven by Juliette and her ramblings thoughts. Another hurdle of this novel is the prose, something that I feel will probably alienate many readers since...it's not exactly typical to read novels with lines like I'm catapulted across the room by my own fear or My mouth freezes in place . Also, the strike-outs may become a teensy-bit annoying to some readers. As for my experience, I was surprised: the\u00a0prose didn't bother me. It actually reminded me of a verse novel (which, I know, many people don't like...but I find some of them very lovely, albeit a bit thin plot-wise). And it also helped that the prose fit the character. Juliette is an isolated girl, left alone with nothing but her own thoughts and words. Her thoughts, eccentric and detailed as they are, are coping mechanisms. The words help her to distance herself from her situation, and even after her life begins to brighten she still relies on her old habits of describing things and actions in an unnatural way. What would have bothered me is if Juliette hadn't seemed a bit \"different\" after spending so much time alone. Then I would have thought her a robot, and the story would not have drawn me in nearly as much. The hero, Adam, and the antagonist, Warner, also managed to get my heartstrings all tangled. I couldn't help noting some of the sweetness and tenderness I had seen in Peeta Mellark's character within <---C>Adam Kent</---C>. In contrast, Warner...is a sadistic bastard of a character, but his obsession with Juliette and her powers is as sorrowful as it is pitiful and disturbing. Though a part of me dreads the love triangle already beginning to form, a greater part of me finds the dynamics fascinating since Adam and Warner are two opposite ends of the spectrum. One is heroic and kind; the other is cruel and nearly mad during certain moments. Even though it's a no-brainer who the \"right\" choice is, one must wonder how this will all play out if Juliette begins to look at herself as a monster again. I'm not going to lie: the direction this novel takes is familiar yet still a bit surprising. When I opened this book, I hadn't known what to expect...but, near the end, I found myself at a complete one-eighty from what I had first expected. That in and of itself is a good thing, so I'm hoping that the rest of the trilogy will continue to bring surprises to the table. With the ending, I actually felt that I had a glimpse of what Tahereh Mafi had been hoping to accomplish with this novel. It's an origins story of transformation and healing amid darkness, despair, and loneliness. The only major thing that irked me a little in this first novel was that the lack of other female characters was...quite noticeable. It gets a tad annoying that all the other characters (who matter) are boys in this first installment. No matter how strong Juliette becomes as a character, somehow it will feel a little lacking if she's the lone girl amid adoring males. I love strong heroines even more when they have a few other strong females around them . As much as I really enjoyed this first installment, my reading experiences with the next two novels may be hindered as far as enjoyment goes if Juliette remains the one girl who matters in the story. Mixed though the opinions may be about this novel, Shatter Me really surprised me with its take on the dystopian genre, narrative style, and characterization. I look forward to seeing what will happen as the story progresses throughout the trilogy, so here's hoping the ride will continue to be exhilarating to me as a reader. As for whether you should try this one for yourself...I advise making use of preview chapters before committing to read the entire novel. Shatter Me isn't going to be for everyone, but I hope that it will find the readers who will appreciate and savor it for what it is and be able to ignore the flaws that may hamper full enjoyment of this novel . ...more This book is pretty darn bad.

Now I realise it's from watching the movie. I kind of ignored the feeling out of guilt, but obviously I was remembering a particular part in the movie. Yeah.. I'm not sure what to think of this. I mean, is it supposed to be a tribute to the book of some kind? Let me know what you think :/ My Thoughts - Juliette hasn't touched or talked to a single soul in 263 days. She is now part of a new world. A world where animals are close to extinct, the English language soon lost, books and our history on the verge of being erased and even birds have stopped flying. Being close to starved in a cell and alone for so long has taken it's toll. She is a broken girl who has given up and learned to not fight back in order to survive. But when she finds herself with a new cell-mate: Adam, she's horrified. She recognises him, or so she thinks. But this boy isn't like the others. He looks at her with kind eyes, he's curious. His curiosity could get him killed. He doesn't know what she's capable of. That her touch is lethal. SHATTER ME is very entertaining. Heck, I straight up devoured the book and had a good time doing so. But it doesn't come without its flaws. Let me tell you now. I do analyse a lot. So if you're a reader that just wants something enjoyable and fast paced, then you will find that with this book. If you don't care for the things I'm about to mention, and hey, had they not bothered me, this would have been a high four star to a 5 star read. But unfortunately, there were flaws, and they did bother me. First off, I found Juliette very annoying at times. At first, you think that she's been through hell. She's been bullied for being different and even pushed away by her family - which can be traumatising for any child. But as the story progresses, instead of eventually growing out of her shell and being more stronger as a person, she instead remains pretty much a coward. Cowering behind Adam, or in a corner at the mention of threat. Sure, she likes to give Warner attitude, but only because she knows that he won't hurt her. On another note. She comes across as very innocent, vulnerable and naive, but can't seem to stop thinking about how she'd like to have her way with Adam - all the time if I might add. \"You're going to get better,\" I promise him. \"And when you do, I'm going to show you exactly what choice I've made. I'm going to memorize every inch of your body with my lips.\" <-- WTF was my first reaction. This is our naive Juliette talking? Was my second. I thought I had slipped into a naughty romance novel for a second there xD Also, she seems to react to every guy that pays her attention. I mean, you claim to be in love with a particular guy, then what's with all the lusting for the others. In fact, why is it that every attractive guy that she meets falls for her. I know she's supposed to be really pretty, but really? At this rate, forget a triangle, there might just be a darn square! LOL :P Highlights? The sexytimes :) There were many, and the author wrote them very well. I grinned a little, or maybe a lot. As for Adam? As nice and attractive he may be, it was Warner and Kenji that really caught my eye. These two made the book for me. Kenji, girls, is charming and funny. And he completely won me over. Truthfully, when you have Adam and Juliette being so dramatic all the time and constantly declaring their love for one another (which I still don't buy) it's nice to have someone like Kenji around to lighten the mood. But also, he's just really awesome :) Warner, on the other hand is the bad guy. But there's something about this 'bad guy' that you can't quite bring yourself to hate. He may be on the wrong side, but there are instances that show a side to him that makes you soften up to him. He has a vulnerability about him. Clearly he is sad and lonely. There's definitely more to him than meets the eye and I'm very intrigued. He may have obsessive tendencies but there's something about him that's very appealing. It may be wrong, but I doubt I'm the only one who found herself swooning. The metaphors. Gosh, this book is full of them. You know, one or two once a while may seem nice and pretty, but to have 3/4 on every single page just gets annoying and tiresome. I'll give you a few examples: I am nothing but Novocaine. I am numb, a world of nothing, all feeling and emotion gone forever. I am a whisper that never was. Realisation is ice-cold water and it's dripping down my spine. I am gaping with my eyes, gaping with my mouth, gaping wide open because I feel holes everywhere, punched into the terrain of my body. My heart must be bleeding out of my chest. My words wear no parachutes as they fall out of my mouth His eyes are two shots of green punched through a pane of glass. Cutting through me. He leans back against the couch. Runs a free hand over his face. Seasons change. Stars explode. Someone is walking on the moon. My eyelashes trip into my eyebrows; my jaw drops into my mouth It's raining today. The sky is weeping for us. I'm wearing dead cotton on my limbs and a blush of roses on my face. I rolled my eyes, a lot. I may have grown fond of James (Adam' little brother), Kenji and Warner, but I found Juliette and Adam rather bland - which is pretty worrying. I felt like Juliette was just your typical helpless girl and Adam your typical protector. They just seemed to stick in these roles throughout the novel - leaving little for character growth. At least Warner and Kenji are interesting. The actual world building was lacking in my opinion. Maybe they'll explain more in the next novel, but I'm still wondering why there wasn't much of an in depth explanation for why things were the way they were. I felt like the book completely headed into the romance and just ignored the world building - which is so crucial when it comes to this genre. It's towards the last few pages that the book takes the \"X Men\" route. And hey, I'm a fan, a big one actually. So all I could see when I saw Juliette was Rogue, only less badass. But I think things went too far. (view spoiler) [I mean, not only is there this whole institute of sorts like the cartoon, but for heavens sake they even have their own Xavier. A man who helps them control their powers. Ironically, that very man can move things with his mind, well, like Xavier. *sighs* I'm all for powers since its a lot more interesting than a lot of other things out there right now, but I wish it wasn't so close to home. I would have preferred things to have not to been so obvious in being similar. And did anyone else find it awfully ironic that Adam could touch her? (hide spoiler) ] It's a little painful giving this one 3 stars. It's much better than your average read. It has great potential. And a part of me feels like it deserves more. But personally, there are so many things that weigh this book down that I can't see myself giving it more. Warner and Kenji have kept me loyal, though, so I'll be looking out for the sequel. I'm just hoping that there's an improvement in the world building and character development department, because I do see potential. Oh, and less metaphors please. ...more MKAY. First of all.

Okay. Moving on. So OK. I\u2019m kind of ashamed to admit that I was totally into the story . Ugh whatever. I\u2019m not ashamed. Maybe I am. Whatever. It wasn\u2019t the most original story ever and it certainly had its very\u2026odd\u2026 parts\u2026 but I\u2019m totally curious about book two and I\u2019ll definitely be continuing. Maybe because the promise of something more from friends? Who knows. I can\u2019t help it\u2026 I got into it. (Harriet, girlfriend.. thanks for being there for me.) As I continued powering through...I found that I never got less annoyed with the writing SO I just started skipping the unnecessary sentences\u2026 thus the book was a little more enjoyable. *************** This is where I\u2019m going to get somewhat spoilery so stop here if you haven\u2019t read this book\u2026 The Characters Juliette.

The whole taking are of your family, living through abuse\u2014 I feel you bro, I feel you. Thats some tough crap. Warner \u2026. well alright. I don\u2019t know if its because of all the crazy fandoms over this guy but I\u2019m interested. Clearly we haven\u2019t the foggiest on whats going on in his little brain. Right now he seems like an over obsessed lunatic\u2026 but who knows. Kenji - Congrats dude. You\u2019ve won my favorite character for this book award.

Juliette + Adam\u2019s rather quickly escalating relationship Don\u2019t hate me guys but I have some issues with this. YES there are feels\u2026 and I would have totally been on board for them EXCEPT FOR THE FACT that how can you be so focused on lust when you both are literally fighting/running for your life?? I\u2019m sorry, but making out is the last thing that should be on your mind if you are trying to keep each other alive. Ughhh Tamlin much? Like you guys were apart for years and you never talked to each other in the first place (AND YES THAT BUILD UP WAS SWEET\u2026 I genuinely appreciated their connection..) but come on - talk first! Survive first! Chill your dills. Seriously, I liked these two together.. but that just made me uncomfortable. Whatever, I know what happens to them in book 2. The Worldbuilding So this was really only mildly developed- we\u2019re only told bits and pieces. Honestly this didn\u2019t bother me though- I\u2019m typically much more interested in the characters. It feels like a fairy generic dystopian world but whatever. I anticipate much more from this in book 2. Okay but really WTF is with elastic boy?? Da fuck? Lasting Impressions So despite my little rants... WHATEVER OK..

Her only outlets are the ragged notebook she keeps balled beneath her mattress and the hope she holds with white knuckles\u2014her only tether to sanity, it seems. Before her existence distilled to four gray walls and one square window, she\u2019d witnessed the degradation of the world\u2014the food shortages, the environmental problems, the panic. She\u2019d watch the Reestablishment step in, heard their promises of solution. She doesn\u2019t know the state of the world now, but she can see the sky is the wrong color and weather follows no discernable pattern\u2014other than holding a beauty she longs to touch. She is utterly alone, cut off from the world and volleying between despair and hope\u2014until she is given a cellmate. Adam\u2019s arrival sets in motion a sequence of events that leads her to the very heart of the Reestablishment regime. She must make a choice: is her freedom worth more than the lives of others\u2014than the lives of those who have taken freedom from her? Is she willing to fight\u2014not only for what is right, but for herself? I loved Juliette. I feel like in a lot of dystopian stories, the author has to choose between making their main character strong, or making them likable\u2014like their strength has to supersede their heart, otherwise they will be considered weak-willed females, improbable in a leadership role. This is not the case with Juliette. Her greatest strength is her heart, beyond even that of her physical power. Which is saying a lot, because her powers? Yeah, they\u2019re super badass, despite being utterly inconvenient and dangerous. I have a feeling we don\u2019t even really know what she\u2019s capable of yet. But I know it will be awesome. The story itself is complex\u2014well-crafted and well-paced with three dimensional characters right on down the line. The antagonist is not a mustache twirling caricature, there were times I felt a pang of almost sympathy for him; I think there are greater depths to his character that have not yet been uncovered. Even the secondary characters are fully fleshed out\u2014I\u2019m halfway in love with Kenji, who provided some much needed levity, and would like to request some serious snuggle time with James. And then there\u2019s Adam. Guys. GUYS. I can\u2019t with Adam. I just\u2026 I cannot. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say. (Except maybe ohmysweetsparklingjesushe\u2019ssoflippinghotandexactlyzeropercentofmecanhandleit.) There is a twist at the end that I think readers will either love or hate. I am in the love camp. I think it's an exciting idea which, if executed correctly, could bring a unique storyline to the YA world. But it will depend on the execution, as there's a fine line between an exciting and unique spin, and the bastardization of a much loved comic series. However, I have complete faith that Mafi can pull it off. One of the things that really cemented SHATTER ME as a winner for me, was the fact that IT\u2019S A COMPLETE STORY. It has a beginning, a middle and an end that could stand on its own even if there weren\u2019t two more books in the series. I almost wept for the joy of this miracle. The only complaint I have is this: Mafi\u2019s prose is GORGEOUS. From an aesthetic standpoint I was absolutely in love with her writing style\u2014so unique and lovely. As a reader you are completely in Juliette\u2019s head; the narration reads the way a broken seventeen year old\u2019s thought process should. However, I found myself distracted at times, pulled out of the action because I was focusing on actual writing itself. Thinking, \u201coh, I love the way she put these words together\u201d instead of being totally immersed in what was going on. That is really my only complaint with the story. It's a minor complaint in SHATTER ME, but could prove to be a bigger detraction in the subsequent books, when I assume the action will ramp up and Juliette will be less introspective. In short: this was awesome. You need to read it when it\u2019s released in November. ...more I only know now that the scientists are wrong. The world is flat.

And I did it! *happy dance* I\u2019ve been meaning to re-read this book and the whole trilogy for a while now and the time has come. Let\u2019s start with what I didn\u2019t like about the book. Like most dystopian novels, Shatter Me falls into the where\u2019s the backstory? category. Even though we are offered some information about the damage left in the world and what caused it kind of that\u2019s just it. We\u2019re never told about the process, about the first major indicator or the first country to fall. And the thing is, with this book, the devastation is worth reading. As far as we can tell, it started with environment damage caused by the human population. The exact same thing we are doing right now , so the things the people in charge had to do in order to keep things to go any further, all the regulation, the beginning of the Reestablishment\u2026 that\u2019s interesting. Why people have these powers? Was some virus in the air and mutated? Were they experimenting with genetic so they make sure some people survive? None of those questions were answered in this book I can\u2019t remember if they\u2019re answered in the next ones. That\u2019s about all I didn\u2019t like because the rest of the book? I fucking loved it. Tahereh\u2019s writing style is so poetic and beautiful and instead of being heavy, it\u2019s so fast paced and easy to read. The sun is an arrogant thing, always leaving the world behind when it tires of us. The moon is a loyal companion. It never leaves. It\u2019s always there, watching, steadfast, knowing us in our light and dark moments, changing forever just as we do. Every day it\u2019s a different version of itself. Sometimes weak and wan, sometimes strong and full of light. The moon understands what it means to be human. Uncertain. Alone. Cratered by imperfections. I also liked the scratched font part , I think it\u2019s a good indicator. How? Well, in the beginning, you can see how weak (?) Juliette is and therefore the way it\u2019s written is full of scratched font and doubts but, as the story goes and she grows confident we see less and less of this . That\u2019s quite interesting and great to read. Evolution is the key in this book and that\u2019s something you can see through the pages. Yep, great character development. The plot is something we\u2019ve already seen but I think is well driven and it gives the characters the space they need to shine. Now, with Warner, the bad boy syndrome strikes one more time. There isn\u2019t a part of me that hates him. I just couldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I felt there was more of him than what he shows. Plus, I admire his determination and he\u2019s so sharp, intelligent, ruthless and hot. I love the guy even though there wasn\u2019t that much information about him, (view spoiler) [I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll re-read Destroy Me and review it bc I\u2019m kinda lazy (hide spoiler) ] he managed to get my attention and he didn\u2019t let it go. He\u2019s just such an interesting character. I\u2019m shocked by the tenderness in his voice. The sincerity with which he wants to know. He\u2019s like a feral dog, crazed and wild, thirsty for chaos, simultaneously aching for recognition and acceptance. Love. And he\u2019s such an asshole. God, I love him \u201cMy promises aren\u2019t worth much, love,\u201d he whispers. \u201cOr have you forgotten?\u201d 3 inches forward. His hand on my waist. His breath sweet and warm on my neck. \u201cI\u2019m an exceptional liar.\u201d Now, Adam, Uh, how could I describe Adam? Y\u2019all know I\u2019m not a fan of him, never been, never will. It\u2019s just he\u2019s so\u2026 meh . He doesn\u2019t offer me more than a possible crush and I don\u2019t have a crush on him He\u2019s good people but he\u2019s not for me. He wants sweet, good and all of that. He wants people honest-to-God-good and that\u2019s not possible. Not in his world, not in ours. So maybe that\u2019s why I never liked him that much. Can\u2019t help it, I like my characters dark, volatile and crazy. Juliette is a different thing. She\u2019s spent years in this asylum, away from human interaction but she didn\u2019t have much of that to begin with. Since her \u201cgift\u201d appeared when she was a baby, she was always feared. An outcast. So, she knows little about being loved but despise that she has so much love to give. It\u2019s amazing how caring she is. And how she sees the world, how she feels things. Please touch me, is what I want to tell him. But things happen when people touch me. Strange things. Bad things. Dead things. I can\u2019t remember the warmth of any kind of embrace. My arms ache from the inescapable ice of isolation. My own mother couldn\u2019t hold me in her arms. My father couldn\u2019t warm my frozen hands. I live in a world of nothing. Hello. World. You will forget me. I\u2019m also amazed by her powers. They\u2019re so raw and powerful and beautiful. In a dark, deadly way but beautiful still. So much strength. I\u2019m a sucker for power. I like the X-Men factor of the book, Juliette is like Rogue and there are others characters that are similar to the mutants. \u00d1om, \u00f1om, Laura likes it. There are really likeable characters with snarky comebacks and they\u2019re really fun to read. Overall is a really great book, a quick read with really cool characters. Plus, the writing style, again, it\u2019s so beautiful. It\u2019s one of my favorite trilogies right now.

Until it spins around and lies with lips and teeth carved into the semblance of something too passive to punch.\u201d Once I started reading this book, I could not stop. I absolutely loved the fact that Juliette could kill with just a single touch and how she's been locked up in this prison type thing for a long time. Like, she didn't speak a word in 264 days! If I were her, I would probably go insane and start yelling to myself to make time go by. \u201cI wish I could stuff my mouth full of raindrops and fill my pockets full of snow. I wish I could trace the veins in a fallen leaf and the feel the wind pinch my nose.\u201d Anyways, so Adam comes in and stays with her for a couple weeks until they arrive at the Reestablishment. Adam, Adam, Adam, where do I start? I liked him towards the beginning when he was being cocky, but later on, I felt like I was going from Chocolate Lucky Charms to Raisin Bran. Soggy Raisin Bran. Or tasteless oatmeal. He just became so bland and a Mal-type-character (I always use Mal as an example for these types of guy characters). And he fell too hard and too fast for Juliette. Before I get into her, I'm going to talk about a little thing called insta-love so all y'all can listen up. Insta-love can just insta-die. Now, I understaaaand that Juliette and Adam went to school together and that Adam has had a crush on her for like ever, BUT they haven't communicated in all that time until he was in her cell. And all of a sudden...BAM they're totally head over heals with each other. Their relationship wasn't that developed and it was...well...boring. Like Adam....and Juliette. Alrighty, Juliette. Gurl ,you need a personality makeover or somethin. For a girl who can kill anyone with just a touch of her hand, you're not that intimidating. She felt more like a side character to me because she didn't do all that much or say all that much. Adam was the one constantly taking care of her and I felt like she needed to take charge for once. I hope she will go through some hard core character development in the second book, because guuuurl, you are as bland as waffles...without the syrup. And she needs to work on that blushing problem of hers, she only does it like every other page. Okay, okay, she's really not that bad, she just needs to find her strengths, that's all. I WANT HER TO ACTUALLY KILL PEOPLE. \u201cYou're absolutely delicious when you're angry.\" \"Too bad my taste is poisonous for your palate.\u201d AND THEN ALONG CAME A CERTAIN SONOFABITCH WHO WILL MOST LIKELY RUIN MY LIFE. HE IS A VILLAIN. HE IS A LOVE INTEREST. HE IS BASICALLY A DYSTOPIAN DARKLING WITH BLONDE HAIR. HE IS.........WARNER. OH THESE POWER HUNGRY VILLAIN LOVE INTERESTS ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO SHATTER ME TO LITTLE LOVE SICK BITS. ONCE I HEARD THE \"BLONDE HAIR\" THING, I KNEW WHO IT WAS. Warner is the best character in this book. He is sorta psychotic, a stalker, and a murderer, but hot, so it's okay guys. I don't want to admit it, but he did have the insta-love thing for Juliette, but I ship it still. I shouldn't be shipping things like this, it's so wrong............ yet so right . And they totally made out, even though Juliette was only doing so to get his gun from his jacket to kill him. AND GOOD THING SHE MISSED HIS HEART. I WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MAD IF HE ACTUALLY DIED, I PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE STARTING THE NEXT BOOK IF THAT HAPPENED. Alright, so world building. Didn't like it because there really was no world to build. We hardly got any detail about this polluted dystopian world and I want some! I hope we get more of this needed detail in Unravel Me. And I loved Kenji, he was so fun and his lines cracked me up. Apparently, he can turn invisible now. \u201cSon of a motherless goat!\u201d Lol what. I guess Adam and Warner are the only ones who are able to touch Juliette without dying and I WANT TO KNOW WHY. I DID NOT GET AN ANSWER. I NEED TO KNOW WHY WARNER IS ABLE TO TOUCH JULIETTE. BECAUSE IT'S TRUE LOVE THAT CAN'T BE DENIED. So I guess Juliette's part of the X-Men now. They're like 56 other people with abilities and they are going to try and defeat the Reestablishment who trying to make this perfect society. They hooked up Juliette with this purple onesie and now I guess she's ready to use her powers to defeat evil or some shit. You know what else she could do with that onesie? Go have Warner unzip the back for her and then they can continue to make out. Okaaaaaay....so again, I did really enjoy this book even though I did have a lot of complaints, but Warner makes up for all of it. I am excited for what the second book will bring and I hope that there will be some character development going on! ...more The writing style intrigued me and although at times I was irritated with Juliette, I couldn't help but enjoy this book!

All of my favorites wrapped up into one breathtaking debut. Shatter Me has all the elements that make a novel, a great novel. Superb writing, realistic and dimensional characters, an intense story and a gorgeous cover. The cover doesn\u2019t really make the novel a great one, but I had to throw that one in there. Initially I wasn\u2019t all impressed with this cover. My first thought was another one? The finished product with the foiling, it won me over. There was not one thing that I didn\u2019t like about this novel. Although, I could have used a little more Adam!

Because of her unique ability to kill a person with a single touch, The Reestablishment has taken her from her non-caring parents and locked her in an asylum where she hasn\u2019t seen another human being or spoken out loud for 264 days. She would know - counting is what she does to stay sane. I\u2019ve been neglected abandoned ostracized and dragged from home. I\u2019ve been poked and prodded tested and thrown in a cell. I\u2019ve been studied. I\u2019ve been starved. I\u2019ve been tempted with friendship only to be left betrayed and trapped into this nightmare I\u2019m expected to be grateful for. One day the door of her cell opens and a boy steps inside, a boy Juliette knows very well. The two of them have trouble trusting each other at first, but just as they manage to form a weak bond, Warner, one of the leaders of The Reestablishment, comes to take Juliette away, determined to turn her into a powerful weapon. Warner\u2019s obsession with Juliette and the fact that she\u2019s literally untouchable are the only things keeping her alive. Forced to choose between dying and killing other people for The Reestablishment, Juliette will do anything to find a third option, one that includes the boy she\u2019s always loved. I had no trouble picturing the world Tahereh Mafi created. In fact, when I try to think about what\u2019s coming, that\u2019s pretty much what I see. (I\u2019m not exactly an optimist.) Terrifying soldiers in grey uniforms, grey concrete under a grey sky. Food rationing for everyone except for the privileged few. This is where I think she did an excellent job. Ordinarily, I view decorative writing as something worthy of admiration. People like Maggie Stiefvater open up new worlds for me, or at the very least add colors that my eyes, until that point, refused to see. But there\u2019s a huge step between poetic prose and beautiful-sounding nonsense, and I\u2019m afraid Mafi crossed the line quite a few times. There were sentences that just didn\u2019t make any sense, no matter how lovely they sounded. On the other hand, there were parts that simply took my breath away, and I loved how innovative and bold the writing was as a whole. All the repetition gave it an interesting rhythm, and the striked out text helped us understand Juliette\u2019s inner conflicts. I can\u2019t wait to find out what these characters will do next. He\u2019s wrong he\u2019s so wrong he\u2019s more wrong than an upside-down rainbow. But everything he said is right.

I remember marveling at how juvenile YA at the turn of the decade used to be, but it's not claw-my-eyes-out, why-the-fuck-was-I-given-the-ability-to-comprehend-words bad. The prose, which I thought would be the major obstacle, didn't bug me at all. The flowery metaphors and strike-throughs complemented Juliette's fragmented state of mind quite well, and I can definitely see my literature class breaking down the blurred barrier between journal and reality. While it enforces my growing concern with the literary aesthetic of mental illness (Have you noticed that most books about it are written in flowery, romanticized prose?), it's readable and fascinating. I could complain about the cheesy landslide of romance, but honestly? It was more funny than irritating. Just look at that line. Look at it. \"You I would kill for pleasure,\" he says to Adam. \"But Juliette is the one I want forever.\" I must have guffawed for at least ten minutes. The love triangle is so over-the-top and melodramatic, it's physically impossible to take seriously. Everything is spelled out for us like we're idiots. Or Ana Steele. Adam explains v-e-r-y clearly that Warner is broken and evil and that he wants Juliette to voluntarily choose him. Put up a big red sign that says Dangerous Love Interest, why don't you? Adam is the obligatory safe, boring choice that pounds his chest and makes possessive remarks. That scene where they're fighting over Juliette, man, trying to \"out-confess\" the other person. I still laugh when I think of it. Everyone thinks Juliette is beautiful. Everyone. It doesn't matter if she's malnourished and hasn't shaved her legs in 264 days. She's also pure and good and probably popped out of the Virgin Mary's untarnished vagina. Forgive me if I want a little complexity to my protagonists. You can create a \"good\"character without making her a saint. Look at Harry Potter, Katniss Everdeen, or Inej from Six of Crows . Having Juliette backsass Warner isn't the same as letting her have realistic human emotions. Though nothing about Shatter Me is realistic. The romance sparks at the speed of a flash flood, which I could accept if it were the result of a mating bond like in High Fantasy, but not in a world that's an extension of ours. It's a caricature of... something, because it sure as hell isn't a dystopian. World-building is non-existent, though apologists will pin that on Juliette's seclusion and lack of awareness. The story essentially revolves around people and since all the important people in Juliette's life are love interests, it's heavily, heavily romance-centric. At least Twilight had the rest of the Cullen family and Bella's dad. But what the hell. It was entertaining. One last thing. Warner disturbs me. He's framed as a love interest, which terrifies me even more. Pay attention to the way Juliette describes her interactions with him: \"Trapped\", \"Threatened\", \"Unable to move\". Someone should put a rape trigger warning on this book because his body language is dangerously accurate. Yeah, yeah, he's the villain, but he's also someone we're supposed to root for. There are ways to write antiheroes without descending to macho dominance. There are ways to portray Warner's desire for her without making him into every dick that deliberately trails after a woman in the dark, just to see her sweat. Food for thought.

But unfortunately I can\u2019t recommend this book. The book has so many problems and doesn\u2019t even read like a real novel. The characters are very flat and the writing is overdone and repetitive. The worst of it is nothing really happens. Juliette, the main character, has a deadly touch and is in an asylum at some time in the future. Then the guards give her a cellmate, a guy named Adam, and the poor girl who has been isolated for her entire life and locked up for 264 days falls instantly in love with him. The reader is told that sparks fly and Juliette is very attracted to her handsome cellmate, but I didn\u2019t feel it because I didn\u2019t know either character or know why they were even in love. There was no connection. When they are let out of the asylum because Adam is a solider working for Warner, the villain, Juliette is held captive in his palace place. Nothing really happens there either, except her and Adam getting close to kissing and being interrupted by something many times. You find out Adam and Warner are both immune to Juliette\u2019s deadly touch and then they break out and end up in a school for other people with powers and thats the end. This book does not remind me of The Hunger Games in any way. Juliette is not even close to as strong or independent as Katniss. When Adam appears, he is all she ever thinks about. There are no action scenes in this book and there is no mystery to figure out or tension to find out what happens next. I would say that this book is much closer to X-Men since it gets pretty comic-bookish in the second half of the novel but it\u2019s missing all the heart. ...more The only reason I gave this book 4 and not 5 stars is because I really dislike Adam and Juliette as a couple.", "Title": "Shatter Me"},
