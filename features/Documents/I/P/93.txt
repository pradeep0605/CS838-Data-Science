{"Comments": "HOLY FREAKIN MOLY! This book was beyond superb. I can't even find the words for it. Phenomenal! Coben holds your interest from the first to the last word. Every chapter revealed another layer that was peeled, revealing some startling discovery. Absolutely one of my favorite novels by Coben. He is by far, the best author around. Highly recommend this novel!!! Get it and read it! NOW!!!!!!! (<---B>You won't regret it</---B>) When I first started reading \"<+++>Gone for Good</+++>\" by my favourite author <---A>Harlan Coben</---A> I had to put it down as I just couldn't get into it, however having picked it up again a few days later I fully realised that it was ME and in NO WAY the book! My word! This addictive book was one helluva thriller, pace perfect it pulls you in and just doesn't let you go - I didn't want it to end and wished there had been more! There was layer upon layer of plot lines, fantastic breakneck speed twists and turns and When I first started reading \"<+++>Gone for Good</+++>\" by my favourite author Harlan Coben I had to put it down as I just couldn't get into it, however having picked it up again a few days later I fully realised that it was ME and in NO WAY the book! My word! This addictive book was one helluva thriller, pace perfect it pulls you in and just doesn't let you go - I didn't want it to end and wished there had been more! There was layer upon layer of plot lines, fantastic breakneck speed twists and turns and an phenomenal ending that after having had you so tense had me emotionally wrecked! I SO loved the main characters <---C>Will Klein</---C> and 'Squares' - I could see my favourite characters Win and Myron in them which made me so happy! Even a visit from Hester Crimstein - brilliant! And as for 'Ghost' - I don't think a baddie has had me so creeped out since Hannibal Lecter! I wish I could give this more than 5 stars - Harlan just keeps on coming with fantastic books and plot lines - I don't know where he gets them from - but wow! this is definitely one of my favourite by Harlan (and I think I say that every time haha!). I highly recommend this book, if you've never read anything by Harlan before I urge you to start now you won't be disappointed - you'll be hooked and with so many books to read by him you'll have plenty to keep you reading! A HUGE 5 stars!!!!!! ...<---F>more Yes, I did it again</---F>. I am addicted. It's like crack. or the crack of an ass. I can feel the damage being done to my brain as I read page after implausible page and I wince at phrase after ham-handed phrase but still I keep going. As McDonalds is to one's arteries so is Coben to ones brain. What is the cranial equivalent of an oxygen tank and an electric wheel chair, and a long day spent drooling through the aisles at Wal-mart? That is what Coben is, what he does to me. God, I hate him.

I really like this authors writing style and his dialogue is terrific throughout this novel. Most of the chapters were nice and short with most having some type of revelation to keep you interested and wanting to keep turning those pages. The plot was filled with lots of twists at a surprising speed that kept me totally engaged in what I was reading.

Most of the chapters were nice and short with most having some type of revelation to keep you interested and wanting to keep turning those pages. The plot was filled with lots of twists at a surprising speed that kept me totally engaged in what I was reading. I found that it was so entertaining and fast-paced that I didn't even want to guess the outcome even though I can now see that we were given a few clues. I thought that I was given enough information on each character that it was easy to follow along with them and the storyline. Will Klein was my favourite character as I felt for him and was rooting for him. HARLAN COBEN actually made me feel that Will was talking directly to me, the reader! This book was chosen to read by me solely on who the author was. Cover, title and synopsis did not come into play on this read. To wrap it up it was an entertaining, enjoyable, quick and easy, fast-paced, and interesting mystery with a very satisfying ending. Would recommend!! http://www.twogirlslostinacouleereadi... ...more \"Three days before her death, my mother told me these weren't her last words, but they were pretty close that my brother was still alive.\" Gone for Good is not so differrent from Tell No One. I was astounded how these books started off the same with the main character making an assumption that the death person is still alive. While Tell No One packs with action and gutwrenching scenes, Gone for Good is full of drama and heartbreaking stories. I enjoyed Gone for Good since the first few chapters \"Three days before her death, my mother told me these weren't her last words, but they were pretty close that my brother was still alive.\" Gone for Good is not so differrent from Tell No One. I was astounded how these books started off the same with the main character making an assumption that the death person is still alive. While Tell No One packs with action and gutwrenching scenes, Gone for Good is full of drama and heartbreaking stories. I enjoyed Gone for Good since the first few chapters, but after various characters come out of nowhere, I got the feeling that this book was hard to concentrate about who each one is or who takes a part in the crime. Can't deny that Coben is a smart writer, he hid the evidences in the evidences, and the twists were likewise profound and cruel that made me frown so many times. The Ghost stood. \"I didn't come back for revenge or even justice,\" Will Klein is my favorite character, it was fun to hear what he knows. His thought is not messy, and his sympathy for other people gives this book a family vibe at the same time. Ken Klein is also an interesting one, even he doesn't take many parts in this book, it still intrigued me when Will thinks of his brother and wholeheartedly hope that he's still alive. But why 3 stars ? As I said, this book is very much alike Tell No One but lacks of action scenes. Although that's not the problem for me, the problem is the characters are too much and they made me confused. Some characters just pop up and disappear, I am so curious that it would be better if Coben limited his characters as few as possible.

Gone for Good is first of Harlan Coben's many novels that I have read and this one drew me is so much that I read it all in one day. Each chapter ends with a cliff hanger and that makes you want to keep reading. He also does a fantastic job of character development. If you enjoy a good mystery that will keep up on the edge and always guessing...I suggest Gone For Good. WOW! That's the first thing I said to my self after finishing this book. Twist after Twist after Twist. Really a good book. My first favorite read of 2016! Holy cow, I had hunches, I solved some clues, I even thought out the chain of events. NEVER in a million years would I have seen the ending coming. Brilliant, clever, and an emphatically cunning crime mystery!!! Bravo Harlan Coben!! A must-read for my fellow readers. I couldn't put the book down it was so white-knuckle gripping! This was my first experience with Harlan Coben and I don't think I'm clamoring to read another. I didn't hate this. It was good enough entertainment for a couple of days. But I can't recommend it. Characters are one-dimensional. But they almost have to be. Revealing too much of each character wouldn't allow Harlan Coben to change what all the characters are and what they stand for and what they'r emotivated by in the last twenty pages.

Revealing too much of each character wouldn't allow Harlan Coben to change what all the characters are and what they stand for and what they'r emotivated by in the last twenty pages. Seriously, this was one of those novels where a new revelation happens every two pages for the entire span of the last forty pages. No, I'm not a good guy. I'm the bad guy! So am I! So is she! I was just joshing. I'm a good guy! I've been hiding my motivation all along so that I can pull this gun out and shoot the real bad guy! With that said, Coben's plot has a break-neck pace. I appreciated that. It made the whole affair finish up that much faster. ...more GONE FOR GOOD is a fast paced thriller with at least 60 plot twists, turns or startling revelations (I catalogued them.) Typical of the genre, it is plot rather than character driven. Even the best characters are a bit shallow, and you will have to accept some improbable ones. Dialogue is written well.

Typical of the genre, it is plot rather than character driven. Even the best characters are a bit shallow, and you will have to accept some improbable ones. Dialogue is written well. Otherwise, the writing is simple - if you got through third grade you won't need a dictionary - although after some stretches of short choppy sentences and dangling phrases you might wish for something more mature. There is unnecessary violence and implausibility both of character and event. Again, that seems typical of the genre. The story is fast paced not just because the author uses cliff hanging chapter endings and plot twists. He dribbles out information. First there is a limousine, then a man in the back seat, then a man sitting next to him, then a driver, then the relationship suggesting they are hoods, and then finally they are. You have to turn pages to get this. Another technique is to insert a short chapter of a seemingly unrelated event, an incomplete scene, and leave it to be developed later, maybe much later. Also, Coben will interleave chapters with two or more related plot elements as he develops the story. This is a four star read in the thriller genre - put \"thriller genre\" in bold italics and underline it. The reviewers who did not like this novel, in general, dislike violent thrillers without well developed characters. A few who do read thrillers found the plot too much like Coben's first thriller, TELL NO ONE. I agree with that. TELL NO ONE opened with a juxtaposition of love and tragedy that was well done and grabbed me in the gut, as it did many other reviewers. As I read GONE FOR GOOD, I wanted to feel the relationship between Will and Sheila, but it wasn't there. That disappointed. For me, the ending in TELL NO ONE was, to be diplomatic, moronic. As I read the startling ending of GONE FOR GOOD, it seemed too far over the top, but when I got to the one page epilogue, my stomach settled and I smiled ...more I just finished this book and I feel like I've gone on a hell of a roller coaster ride without even leaving home. WOW! This book was absolutely incredible! Every time I thought I had it figured out, Coben came up with another twist to make me question my theories or spin them into nothing but complete chaos.

If you want something a little more sedate and bland, then you may wish to just leave this book alone because once you start reading, you won't be able to stop -- just like when you strap in to a real roller coaster ride. ...more Justas seriam as 3,5*. Harlan Coben \u00e9, normalmente uma leitura segura. Uma trama bem pensada, com voltas e reviravoltas, que resulta num policial levezinho que me mantem sempre interessada. Gostei bastante deste, adorei as personagens, desde o Will, ao John Asselta. O final acabou por ser uma surpresa.. aconselho esta leitura Coben takes a good plot and suspense, but taints it with cardboard characters and too much suspension of belief. The humorous first person which I normally love seems to only work part of the time. Will, the protagonist seems to have only two traits: irrationally angry and hopelessly naive (you know, when another character is trying to explain a formulaic plot twist that you as the reader saw through five minutes earlier, but he just can't wrap his head around it.)

The only interesting character is one of the antagonists, the Ghost, and even he is dulled down by the end. With the plot and pacing, I might have rated this one higher if I hadn't recently read so many superior books lately, including thrillers. This is your literary equivalent of a Lifetime Movie Network original. ...more if goodreads would have that half star possible this would be 3.5 ... Fast read with quite a few twists that this author often delivers. I have read one of Harlan Coben's stand alone novels, albeit some time ago, and am slowly working my way through his back catalogue. In this book we meet Will Klein and I found that it didn't take long for me to like him. What also became apparent pretty quickly was that Will Klein is an ordinary bloke. He isn't somebody who can ruthlessly take down bad guys and he isn't a brooding lead character that has an issue with authority.

He isn't somebody who can ruthlessly take down bad guys and he isn't a brooding lead character that has an issue with authority. In other words, a welcome change from the ordinary leading male cop type character! The story itself is quite interesting and before long you realise that the disappearance of Will's girlfriend is far from ordinary. There is also the added plot thread that includes the disappearance of Wills brother who is trhe main suspect in the murder of Julie Miller 11 years prior. One of the things that really struck me with the Myron Bolitar series of books was the great characters, this book was no different. Will Klein's friend Squares is a brilliant added character and I found that I would have like to have actually seen more of him in the book. Even with that as a negative this book was still an absolutely brilliant read. Towards the end I found myself reading even quicker and I must say that the last few chapters had many twists and surprises in store which I absolutely loved. All in all it was another winner from Harlan Coben. ...more My first Harlan Coben book and will definitely not be my last. I just love the way Harlan Coben writes. I think most authors struggle to pull of writing in the second person but you feel like Harlan's having a conversation with you - the Reader - as you read this book.

His brother has been framed as the killer of a girl he used to love. The police force think his brother's guilty. The local community thinks his brother is guilty. The deceased's family think his brother is guilty. Even his parents harbour doubts about his brother's innocence. Still, Will believes his brother - Kevin Klein - is innocent. His brother goes on the run and for many years, it'd appear his gone for good and never to come back. Will's mother whispers something on her deathbed that sets his world upside down and opens a can of worms. I liked how Harlan made Will Klein so vulnerable. You feel for him and wish him all the best. You wish him well but it seems his best intentions only hurt those around him and lead him to dead ends. Will discovers himself in the end and the truth sets him free. A worthy addition to your library. ...more Another great edge of your seat mystery/thriller by a phenomenal writer! One thing I notice about Harlan Coben is that normally his books have multiple plots that there's a point where you get so suckered into tone plot that sometimes you forget there's more than one. Just when you think you've got it all figured out, there's a big twist that you never see coming.

Esperem... Acho que foi \"requintada\"... Ou \"\u00f3tima\"... Acho que foi \"\u00f3tima\"! Bom...j\u00e1 n\u00e3o sei!... Fosse o que fosse tratava-se dum merecido elogio Quanto a mim: Nada a acrescentar \u00c9 um thriller para ler e saborear... At\u00e9 rimou! ;) This was my first Coben book...can't say I'm reaching for another one. This started out okay, and even the ending was different, but meh. Kind of flat. As a boy, Will Klein had a hero: his older brother, Ken. Then, on a warm suburban night in the Kleins' affluent New Jersey neighborhood, a young woman -- a girl Will had once loved -- was found brutally murdered in her family's basement. The prime suspect: Ken Klein. With the evidence against him overwhelming, Ken simply vanished. And when his shattered family never heard from Ken again, they were sure he was gone for good. Now eleven years have passed. Will has found proof that Ken is alive. An As a boy, Will Klein had a hero: his older brother, Ken.

The prime suspect: Ken Klein. With the evidence against him overwhelming, Ken simply vanished. And when his shattered family never heard from Ken again, they were sure he was gone for good.

As a violent mystery unwinds around him, Will knows he must press his search all the way to the end. Because the most powerful surprises are yet to come. I don't know what else I can say about Harlan Coben or his books but I clearly love him and recommend everyone to read this book as well as his others. ...more This was pretty much a waste of time, to be honest. I thought it sounded okay from the description and the first few pages were okay but it sort of just got pretty mediocre from there on. The characters were dull . Will felt so incredibly generic- there was absolutely nothing making him a distinct or memorable character. It felt like I'd read about him ten times before- he was just very flat. The story itself was all right but not enough to warrant four hundred pages. All the twists were really p This was pretty much a waste of time, to be honest.

I'm about 25% through, and may ditch it. It's just not grabbing me. Also not buying into the constant over-the-top emo from the main character. Could be I'm over Harlan Coben's writing style and plotlines, since neither one ever changes. Same story, different book. UPDATE: I'm out. Made it halfway through, but it just wasn't worth reading any further. This is story was slow at first but a great read! No way to keep up at times too many twists turns with shock after shock. I love Will and Sheila, cute couple. The ending was great! I never saw it coming. Harlan Coben is my favorite suspense author. He keeps me on my toes and wanting more. My first Coben book, fun and interesting read. 3.336 stars, read it in one afternoon. Again, I am really not much of a mystery fan. I think this is simply because frequently when you have read more than one title by the same mystery writer-you have cracked their code and the author's work becomes redundant...and altogether un-mysterious. This is not true of the works of Harlan Coben, at least not for the two titles I have read of his thus far. In Gone For Good, Will Klein's life has been marred by the disappearance of his hero and older brother, Ken. The plot thickens, Ken is the Again, I am really not much of a mystery fan.

This is not true of the works of Harlan Coben, at least not for the two titles I have read of his thus far. In Gone For Good, Will Klein's life has been marred by the disappearance of his hero and older brother, Ken. The plot thickens, Ken is the suspected murderer of Will's first love. Will has spent his adult years devoting his time to rescuing teen runaways at the Covenant House. He has fallen in love again, and is finding his way out from under the shroud of mystery and the burden of shame that his brother's absence and alleged crimes have cast upon their family. When Will's mother dies, Will is going through her effects and he stumbles upon a current picture of Ken. What follows the revelation that Will's brother is indeed alive, is a dizzying action-filled tale of twists and turns. Coben has a subtle knack for waxing philosophical. In Gone for Good, he examines the blurring of good and evil that exists within us all. Gone for Good is an honest to goodness page turner, and Coben is a master of mystery. After all, he has passed my two novel mystery writer test with flying colors. ...more There were so many reversals in this complicated plot, I ended up just feeling numb instead of thrilled. Coben does well to get you invested with the hero, Will, an ordinary, good hearted guy who works in a youth shelter and lives with someone he loves.

The shadow over him and his family is the disappearance of his brother Ken nearly a decade before in connection with the murder of Will's ex-girlfriend. Suddenly his current girlfriend splits and violent friends of his brother and the police come to brutally press him in their search for Ken. As Will pursues the mystery, he implausibly overcomes many dangerous situations and each truth he grasps tends to be dashed with successive twists, leaving me feel a bit manipulated. Yet Coben's knack with characters that aren't simply evil incarnate is impessive enough to make me want to give him another try. ...more First I couldn't put this book down. There are surprises that just keep coming but I won't go into plot details to avoid spoilers. The voice is superb. It feels like a friend telling a story, sometimes the protagonist even speaks directly to the reader. The description of New Jersey could only be written by a true native. Its so authentic I can smell the power plants. Finally I love how Harlan spreads the word about the covenant house. Bravo! Not bad... some good twists at the end, but by the time I got there, I didn't care much about any of the characters to really care what happened to them. The characters felt hallow to me, most of them annoying and personality-less I felt the writing style was distracting. Filled with cliches and predictable sappy language.
