{"Comments": "<+++>Witch In The Woods: Clearly's Corruption</+++>I was so excited for this sequel and I wasn't disappointed. It was full of excitement, adventure, a bit of romance and a lot of scary moments! I loved it! It is heart wrenching to read about Clearly's misfortune but that is the sign of a great author, to turn on those emotions and she did a great job! It will be a long wait for the third book (<---B>Blood Moon Ritual</---B>) but very much worth it! This series is a MUST read! You wont be sorry! Wow! Sequels tend to scare me a bit, but this is one of those rare treats where the second in the series is just as good, if not better than the first. Clearly's Corruption, being the second installment of the Witch in the Woods series,<---M> continues the story of Victor</---M>, Fabian & Clearly. The author takes you on one hell of an exciting ride, answers a lot of questions and raises many more.

I give this book 5 full stars and I highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys ya/paranormal books and believe adults of all ages would appreciate it as well. ...more Clearly's Corruption is the sequel to Witch In The Woods, and it caught my attention right during the prologue. I knew before chapter one started that this book was going to be good, and it did not disappoint. It is possibly better than the first book in the series, and the only reason why I gave it four stars is because of the cliffhanger ending.<---F> I want to know what happens</---F>. now. The third book comes out this fall. Its gonna be a long wait. Omg, I loved this book! It started up right away! WOW! Evil witch! Victor needs to snuff her out for good! LOL This was an awesome sequel, and I think even better than the first book, which I also loved. I am psyched for the third book!

Following the young witch hunter Victor Steep after he defeated the witch plaguing the town of Beth's Hallow. Things have calmed down since then, and people have gone back to their normal lives. But suddenly something is wrong with clearly, and it turns out she has been corrupted by her mother, the witch Victor just killed a few months previous, and they have to gather items for a ritual to try and save her. But something more dire is also required... This was a great sequel well worth the wait! It does not dissapoint to matching and even possibly surpassing the previous book in quality, and in the bloody, witchy goodness I've come to love! I recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the first book, and if you haven't read that already, I recommend going back to read that one first! ...more Another great book that, like the first, was hard to put down! Its got a great story about an event you probably didn't think much about in the first book, that came back to bite them in the butt, oh! And the ending! I can't wait for the next book to resolve the big question! Definitely worth the read! I loved this book even more than the first! That Victor can sure take a beating! I cannot wait for Blood Moon Ritual! Read this series! It is worth it! A great sequel to a great series! Cant wait for Blood Moon Ritual! Loved It! I LOVE this book series! I cant wait for the next book! A beautiful paperback for a wonderful story. Can't wait to get my hands on Blood Moon Ritual! Better than the first! which is saying something cuz I loved it too! I am not big on cliffhanger endings but this was an exciting,scary & fun story, and I look forward to seeing how it ends. This book was great! I cannot wait for the third!!! The sequel does not disappoint! This is becoming one of my all time favorite book series! It is so fun, twisted, and cute... cute? Yes! Can't wait till the next book!! Very impressed with this book series. A great second in what is turning out to be a fantastic trilogy.<---A>T. A. Bunker</---A><---C>T. A.
