Maybe. This is, after all, a novel about a dysfunctional family (<---B>father, mother, son</---B>) and the impact of 9/11 on their lives. The novel begins in the cloudy streets after the attack, and it jumps around through the preceding events and the aftermath until it finally returns to the husband's experience inside the towers when the planes hit. The characters are already estranged from each other before they suffer this trauma, and the events that follow only further estrange them. And so, it seems, nobody really knows anybody, and hardly anyone really wants to talk to anyone else about anything, and DeLillo, it seems, wants us to feel this emptiness and helplessness. Conversations between characters are abstract and oblique. They repeat lines often, as if in a trance. Their sentences fall short. They all fade away from each other. Sometimes they even talk about fading away from each other. Maybe this is an accurate portrayal of the shock and confusion of what happened, but it doesn't make good reading. The question it raises, though, is what DeLillo's intention is. Reading this was maddening; there's very little to grab onto. If his goal is for us to experience the same aimless wandering as the people who walked away from the rubble, then he has succeeded. We're confused, we don't know where we're going, but we keep turning the pages. Unfortunately, doing so is a burden. I wanted again and again to abandon this book, but forced myself through it. The ending, however, did offer some reward. In the final pages DeLillo recreates what it was like to be in the towers when the planes struck. It offered something solid and new, and it helped explain the frustrating mood of the rest of the novel. Could DeLillo have started with the crash? It might have explained the tone better in my mind, but he\u2019d have been left without a clear ending. As it is, the attack does serve as a kind of climax. Even so, I realize that some of my distaste also came from being unwilling to let myself into the novel. Already, I was skeptical of the sensationalism of the event. 9/11 still reeks of press and politics, and making a film or writing a book about it seems like a path to an easy buck, even if it is Don DeLillo. As a treatment of 9/11, I appreciated Foer's Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close more. It gives us the distance from the attacks that time has allowed most readers. It takes us away from the immediacy of being in the towers and in the rubble, which most of us will never quite be able to relate to, and explores how that experience has become a part of our lives rather than the entirety of our lives. Do I recommend it? No. Maybe for someone who wants to know what it feels like to be lost. Would I teach it? No. Lasting Impression: Reading this is like walking through fog. There are shapes that look like people moving around you, but you never really know who they are. ...more You pick up a book. You read the blurbs.

He appeared to have, in his last instants of life, embraced his fate. He departed from this earth like an downward arrow. Five years after the attack, he was identified as Jonathan Briley , a a 43-year-old employee of the Windows on the World restaurant. This 2007 novel, Falling Man by the master storyteller Don DeLillo , is not about him. That may disappoint some people. I, too, was disappointed. I was already on the page 30 of this 246-page book waiting for that character to show up. The main male protagonist, Keith who works in the poker house in one of the towers, is seen in the opening scene walking - bleeding and scared and confused - aimlessly around the North Tower before it collapsed. So, where is the falling man? There is a falling man in the story but he was used by Mr. DeLillo as a symbol and not an active character. That falling man works in a circus or doing bungee jumps along the streets of New York. I also thought that Mr. DeLillo would dwell on another dysfunctional American family: Keith, Lianne and Justin as described in the blurbs. That was another disappointment. This is no Home by Marilynne Robinson, nor Cost by Roxana Robinson, nor any other Robinsons, not even funny like the movie Meet the Robinsons . And that is where the magic of DeLillo's writing is anchored upon: being unpredictable. He brings you to a place you are not expecting to go or to accept a reasoning that you are not expecting or not ready to believe. He seems to know what you are thinking as a reader and he hates to be double-guessed. As usual, writing is flawless. The characters, at times, felt like caricatures but I guess that it is the intention. Mr. DeLillo does not what the readers to focus on the family members. The story is about somethings bigger and looming above all of us: global terrorism, racial and religious beliefs and even the purpose of one's life. I learned something new though gruesome: organic shrapnels - human flesh that got driven into the skin of the survivor; it only shows up months later after the bombing.

His novel The Names focuses on a blind search for terrorists, or a group of politically motivated abductors in Mao II . Likewise, Libra places the reader into Lee Harvey Oswald's mindset. Adding in his New York experiences places DeLillo into the cast of authors who come to this subject matter with some creative authority. Falling Man seems at first to follow some regular DeLillo fare: a couple (Lianne and Keith) who had gone through a separation, and the clipped visuals of freeze-frame action. But as the novel bears down on the reader, they show greater depth and deeper pain. It's not about the day after. It follows them for what feels like the rest of their lives with 9/11 wrapped around their torsos. It captures the chronic trauma of it, and it leaves behind an emotional rift for an engaged reader. We've all got jobs that we'd have to get back to--even after a tragic event--pacing around carpeted cubicles or sitting behind desks and carrels. For me, through the din I could hear the rattling in his characters' souls. DeLillo doesn't break his own conventions or introduce brand-new style switches in the literature, but he'll jerk your stride and remind you of what some of us must live with. ...more \u201dThese are the days after.\u00a0 Everything is now measured by after.\u201d As I write this, on the 13th anniversary of 9/11 -- one of the most tragic and revered days in American History -- I reflect back on Delillo\u2019s \u201cFalling Man\u201d and what I got from this fictional text based on a time and place that is still fresh in many minds and hearts as if it happened, in a figurative sense, yesterday.

To be honest and literal, all of these thoughts, while being engrained in our minds at the time, slowly recede, grains of sand by hourglass, from our memory as we age and get older, looking at death in the mirror as it closely arrives to its destination, like Pearl Harbor is no longer on many minds until the anniversary. Delillo\u2019s story fails, at times, to share the emotional side of these people, but brings forth the emotion in the read itself.\u00a0 This is my fifth book in two years by Delillo and it might be my last for awhile.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure there\u2019s been better stories written about this topic, yet I can only recount what I\u2019ve read from this one.

In Underworld , the construction of the twin towers lumed large in the background for a good part of the book. The cover photo itself focuses on the twin towers rising into clouds (smoke?), with a bird (a plane?) flying close by. It may be a stretch to read a connection with 9/11 into Underworld's cover (not to mention it has nothing to do with DeLillo's writing), but it was hard not to imagine these connections while in the middle of reading Underworld when 9/11/01 happened. Moreover, many aspects of DeLillo's writing deal with major world-changing events such as 9/11. How drastically the world changed after JFK's assassination is a topic that threads through several of his books (most magnificently in Libra ). And so maybe not unsurprisingly, immediately following 9/11 DeLillo was accosted by people who thought, for some reason, he would have answers to why 9/11 happened. He responded by writing Cosmopolis , a book which passed over the topic of 9/11 altogether and instead tells the story of a billionare stock market genius engaged in the intentional sabotage of his personal assets as well as those of his clients--all of which occurs over the course of one day in the year 2000 (how quickly everything can change in a day). It is a story of our own undoing from the inside, as opposed to our undoing by outsiders (bringing into question our role as the unprovoked victims of foreign terrorism). Letting a few more years pass, DeLillo finally took on what many thought he eventually would, despite high expectations difficult for anyone to live up to. To be fair, I didn't want to give in to these expectations. I wanted and tried to read Falling Man because it is DeLillo, not because it's a novel about 9/11. Yet after reading Falling Man, I felt something missing in the fragments of the super-charged dialog, vivid settings, and empty characters tossing about in my head--because like the sooty, scattered tons of paper from the fallen World Trade Center, DeLillo's fictional fragments were nearly devoid of emotion. This may very well have been DeLillo's intention, however, that the reader walk away just as vacant and lost as the shells of his characters living on after 9/11. For me, the incredible dialog DeLillo often creates as well as the way he writes about art and history are reasons enough to read any of his books. Yet these reasons will not be enough for everyone. Ultimately, if you feel compelled to read Falling Man--whether because it is a book by DeLillo, or simply because it is about 9/11--you should. Although, I will recommend that it not be the only book you read written by DeLillo. ...more This is as severe as it gets, insofar as it opens with \u201cfigures in windows a thousand feet up, dropping into free space\u201d (4), jumping to avoid death, ruled nevertheless homicide, from the burning WTC.

She works with persons afflicted with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease: Sometimes it scared her, the first signs of halting response, the losses and failings, the grim prefigurings that issued now and then from a mind beginning to slide away from the adhesive friction that makes an individual possible. (30) NB: etymology for latinic translations of slide : from Middle French laps \"lapse,\" from Latin lapsus \"a slipping and falling, flight (of time), falling into error,\" from labi \"to slip, slide, sink, fall; decline, go to ruin.\" Meaning \"moral transgression, sin\" is c. 1500; that of \"slip of the memory\" is 1520s; that of \"a falling away from one's faith\" is from 1650s. (I think that means the patient is a \u2018falling man.\u2019) One of wife\u2019s patients is \u201cnot so much lost as falling, growing fainter\u201d (94). Even as the patient is falling, so too the patient\u2019s condition is ready to fall: \u201cThey approached that was impending\u201d (id.): impend as in in- \"into, in, on, upon\" + pendere \"hang.\u201d Loss of memory is therefore a mutually falling together, a gravitation of sorts between afflicted and affliction.

Wife \u201cwished she could believe this was some kind of antic street theater, an absurdist drama that provokes onlookers to share a comic understanding of what is irrational in the great scheme of being\u201d (163) when confronted with the Falling Man. In interpreting his act, she wonders \u201cif this was his intention, to spread the word this way, by cell phone, intimately, as in the towers and in the hijacked planes\u201d (165)\u2014\u201cor she was dreaming his intentions. She was making it up, stretched so tight across the moment that she could not think her own thoughts\u201d (id.), which is a beautiful little summation of the position of all reading and how the intentional fallacy/death of the author arguments are omnipresent. (Nice joke here, as next paragraph is dude telling her \u201cwhat I\u2019m trying to do\u201d (id.), which is \u201cI\u2019m trying to read her mind\u201d\u2014so doubly the intentional fallacy.) \u2018Falling\u2019 itself is an oddity, contingent upon the movement from one place to another, which is, as the title might plausibly suggest, the master figure of thought here. It\u2019s probably worth recalling Zeno\u2019s paradoxes in these circumstances: Zeno makes a mistake in reasoning. For if, he says, everything is always at rest when it occupies a space equal to itself, and what is moving is always \u2018in the now,\u2019 the moving arrow is motionless. [\u2026] the arrow is stopped while it is moving. This follows from assuming that time is composed of \u2018nows.\u2019 If this is not conceded, the deduction will not go through. (Aristotle, Physics , 6.9239b) Similarly, Simplicius reports Zeno as arguing \u201cIf place exists, where is it? For everything that exists is in a place. Therefore, place is in a place. This goes on to infinity. Therefore place does not exist\u201d ( Commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Physics 562.3-6). Good stuff. Silly, but fun. Thing is, we might locate (!) an aporetic in the notion of position itself. Position etymology: late 14c., as a term in logic and philosophy, from Old French posicion \"position, supposition\" (Modern French position), from Latin positionem (nominative positio) \"act or fact of placing, situation, position, affirmation,\" noun of state from past participle stem of ponere \"put, place,\" from PIE *po-s(i)nere, from *apo- \"off, away\" (see apo-) + *sinere \"to leave, let\" . [emphasis added] We should note the diremptive effect of this etymology: a \u2018leaving\u2019 \u2018away\u2019\u2014i.e., position is linguistically always already away from itself, always already a falling , i.e., place as already a thing in motion\u2014ergo, the contrapositive of Zeno\u2019s paradox, which denies the possibility of motion in extended space? So this would be a double double-bind: the master figure of the text is simultaneously contingent upon two statements that contradict each other, that are themselves internally aporetic\u2014 stasis is both necessary and impossible; kinesis is likewise both necessary and impossible. It\u2019s fuckin\u2019 crazy, yo. Fine debate between wife\u2019s mother and the mother\u2019s lover, which boils down respectively to the positions (heh) of \u201cthey think the world is a disease\u201d v. \u201cThey strike a blow to this country\u2019s dominance\u201d (46). Three sections detail the internal monologue of one of the 9/11 hijackers, whose own opinion is more or less all that is solid melts into air: \u201cA feeling of lost history. They were too long in isolation. This is what they talked about, being crowded out by other cultures, other futures, the all-enfolding will of capital markets and foreign policies\u201d (80), which mediates somewhat between the two positions aforesaid. (NB: wife\u2019s patients await reassurance from her \u201cwhere what is solid does not melt\u201d (127).) Lover\u2019s position is similar to mine: It went on for a time and Lianne listened, disturbed by the fervor in their voices. Martin sat wrapped in argument, one hand gripping the other, and he spoke about lost lands, failed states, foreign intervention, money, empire, oil, the narcissistic heart of the West. (113) Mother\u2019s point is by contrast \u201cIt\u2019s a misplaced [!] grievance\u201d (112). Hijacker believes that \u201cwhat they hold so precious we see as empty space\u201d (177). Not uninvolved in this connection is wife\u2019s understanding that \u201creligion makes people compliant [\u2026] to return people to a childlike state\u201d (62). Significant, then, that her Alzheimer\u2019s patients develop elaborate mythologies regarding 9/11, such as \u201cI don\u2019t forgive God for what He did\u201d (63) and so on. As it happens, her own kid participates in an elaborate mythology of how one \u201cBill Lawton\u201d \u201cflies jet planes and speaks thirteen languages but not English except to his wives. What else? He has the power to poison what we eat but only certain foods\u201d (74). The tragic and the traumatic must invite childish mythologies, and it\u2019s fair to say that the state\u2019s official narrative about 9/11 is likely to be a self-serving mythology only believable by political children (just as the truthers\u2019 counter-mythology also flatters those immature mythopoets\u2019 political preferences, which are not worthy of a serious leftist\u2019s attention). The Hegelian interest, as always: hijacker \u201chad to fight against the need to be normal. He had to struggle against himself\u201d (83). Wife notes at one point that \u201cI could hear myself speaking. My voice was like it was coming from somebody else\u201d (124) (as we have otherwise noted, of course, \u2018voice\u2019 is always already \u201cfrom elsewhere thrown,\u201d the same aporia as in the etymology of position ). One of wife\u2019s patients is \u201ctwo women simultaneously\u201d (125); her mother has \u201cthoughts I can\u2019t identify, thoughts I can\u2019t claim as mine\u201d (id.). Of course, \u201ceverybody has two brains\u201d (126). In developing a post-apocalyptic affair, dude decides to tell his wife about it, \u201ca way to stop being double in himself, trailing the taut shadow of what is unsaid\u201d (161), which is probably the primary significance of Poe\u2019s \u201cWilliam Wilson.\u201d (Wife similarly \u201cwas doubled over, like there were two of her\u201d (169).) Hijacker is similarly \u201cnot here, it was not him\u201d (175). Some involvement with dude\u2019s poker game, which passes from liberal at its inception to a rigorously regimented affair, a display of \u201chow disciplined can we be\u201d (97): \u201cno food [...] no gin, no vodka, no wan liqueurs [\u2026] they agreed to limit themselves to one game only, five card stud.\u201d (98); \u201cThe fact of self-imposed restriction, all the more unyielding for being ordered from within\u201d correlates well with the increasingly \u201clarge sums they bet\u201d (id.), if one considers it all from the perspective of Geertz\u2019s \u201cDeep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight\u201d: Bentham\u2019s concept of \u2018deep play\u2019 is found in his The Theory of Legislation. By it he means play in which the stakes are so high that it is, from his utilitarian standpoint, irrational for mend to engage in it at all. The card players \u201cbanned sports talk\u201d; \u201cRules are good, they replied, and the stupider the better\u201d (99). This stupid is good is placed (ha) into juxtaposition (!) with hijacker, who \u201cspent time at the mirror looking at his beard, knowing he was not supposed to trim it\u201d (82); Indeed, \u201cthe beard would look better if he trimmed it. But there were rules now and he was determined to follow them\u201d (83). Later, hijacker is \u201clooking past the face in the mirror, which is not his\u201d (178). Is this mutually satirizing? Are the poker rules preface to the hijacker rules, or the converse? Which the tragedy, which the farce? The wrinkle with mother\u2019s lover is that he may have been some sort of Red Brigades bomber himself in his youth (146), and now operates legitimately under a different name; \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t know his real name\u201d (145). \u201cHe\u2019s somewhere. I\u2019m somewhere else\u201d (id.). Dude regrettably \u201cthinks these people, these jihadists, he thinks they have something in common with the radicals of the sixties and seventies. He thinks they\u2019re all part of the same classical pattern. They have their theorists. They have their visions of world brotherhood\u201d (147). This is kinda gross, I think; there shall be little ideological overlap between medievalists and marxists. The hijacker\u2019s lacanian mirror stage is itself satirized by a discussion of wife\u2019s mother\u2019s lover\u2019s face: \u201cWho is that man? You think you see yourself in the mirror. But that\u2019s not you. That\u2019s not what you look like. That\u2019s not the literal face, if there is such a thing, ever. That\u2019s the composite face. That\u2019s the face in transition.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this.\u201d \u201cWhat you see is not what we see. What you see is distracted by memory, by being who you are, all the time, for all these years.\" \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear this,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we see is the living truth. The mirror softens the effect by submerging the actual face. Your face is your life. But your face is also submerged in your life. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t see it. Only other people see it. And the camera of course.\u201d He smiled into his glass. Nina put out her cigarette, barely smoked, waving away a trail of smeary mist. \u201cThen there\u2019s the beard,\u201d Lianne said. \u201cThe beard helps bury the face. (114-15) So, by simple mathematical reasoning: hijacker beard buries hijacker face, which is also the hijacker life. The Falling Man also has a \u201cblankness in his face, but deep, a kind of lost gaze\u201d (167); wife \u201cthought the bare space he stared into must be his own, not some grim vision of others falling\u201d; \u201che turns his head and looks into it (into his death by fire) and then brings his head back around and jumps\u201d (id.). Falling Man is accordingly absent, not here, in the manner of other dislocated persons in the novel, and emblematic of same. Wife in seeing this \u201ccould have spoken to him but that was another plane of being, beyond reach\u201d (168) (i.e., not here); she saw \u201cno sign\u201d of another witness previously present (id.); a third witness, \u201cattached to this spot for half a lifetime,\u201d \u201cwas seeing something elaborately different from what he encountered step by step in the ordinary run of hours,\u201d as he had learned \u201chow to see it correctly, find a crack in the world where it might fit\u201d (id.) (something out of place, then?). As she fled, she thought of Falling Man, \u201cback there, suspended, body set in place, and she could not think beyond this\u201d (169). Falling Man is otherwise likened to a \u201cBrechtian dwarf\u201d (223), a reference perhaps to Life of Galileo : I, as a scientist, had a unique opportunity. In my days astronomy reached the market-places. In these quite exceptional circumstances, the steadfastness of one man could have shaken the world. If only I had resisted, if only the natural scientists had been able to evolve something like the Hippocratic oath of the doctors, the vow to devote their knowledge wholly to the benefit of mankind! As things now stand, the best one can hope for is for a race of inventive dwarfs who can be hired for anything. Not sure if the thesis is that Falling Man was market driven rather than principled, or if the reference is more generally to Brechtian verfremdungseffekt . Whichever way, is the Falling Man forming the counter-narrative of 9/11 that Delillo describes in his well-known 9/11 essay (\u201cIn the Ruins of the Future,\u201d Harper\u2019s , December 2001 at 35)? Is it true, as in the same essay (loc. cit. at 34) that \u201cthe terrorists want to bring back the past\u201d? If so, is the counter-narrative of the Bush regime aptly described by Benjamin\u2019s sixth thesis, insofar as \u201ceven the dead will not be safe from the enemy if he wins, and this enemy has not ceased to be victorious\u201d? Punchline of the entire text is granted to mother\u2019s lover, who explains at length how \u201cwe\u2019re all sick of America and Americans\u201d (191), \u201cAmerica is going to become irrelevant,\u201d \u201cIt is losing its center\u201d (id.). As if this radical decentering were insufficient to make the point (Jingo rejoinder: \u201cIf we occupy the center, it\u2019s because you put us there\u201d (192)), lover ties it back, perhaps too tidily: \u201cI don\u2019t know this America anymore. I don\u2019t recognize it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an empty space where America used to be.\u201d (193) The United States is according the Falling Man, no? (\u201cGod is the voice that says, \u2018I am not here\u2019\u201d (236).) The US as indispensable impossibility, stasis , kinesis --but also lapsed, fallen into amnesia, its own crimes forgotten even as it itself is victim of crimes in unlawful response thereto. Develops otherwise the interest from Mao II and other loci the misanthropic notion of \u201cbeing a crowd, this was a religion in itself\u201d (185). Marks out this ugly topos , however, as specifically \u201ca white person\u2019s thoughts, the processing of white panic data\u201d (id.). Probably a bit more severe than Bleeding Edge . Recommended for those who develop bumps caused by small fragments of the suicide bomber\u2019s body ('organic shrapnel'), readers for whom God would be a presence that remained unimaginable, and white persons, white their fundamental meaning, their state of being.

Instead, however, he uses mere PRONOUNS so the reader has to take the extra effort figuring out first who this \"he\" or \"she\" now is. Some novels would have stories so vivid, and characters so alive, that it's as if you are experiencing everything yourself (e.g., \"Dangling Man\" by Saul Bellow). This one by Don DeLillo, in contrast, is just like watching an old, poorly-directed film, in a black-and-white TV with a grainy screen and a very bad audio.

Meg Cabot was living several streets away at the time and wrote a first-person account of the entire horrific incident. I recommend you read her story rather than this artsy, detached piece of crap. This book opens with the events of 9/11 and follows the experiences of one survivor who walks out of one of the twin towers as they topple. It goes on to describe his life in the aftermath. This is a sad and serious book written in De Lillo's typical style with short, choppy sentences and quick changes from one character's perspective to anothers.

What separates Don DeLillo\u2019s attempt, Falling Man (2007), from some of the aforementioned (and what has also divided critics), is his refusal to make any clear statements or offer any semblance of closure. According to Stacey Olster, some of these other texts showcase \u201cthe tendency of the imagination to blunt the impact of 9/11 with recuperative measures \u2026. DeLillo\u2019s re-creation of the attacks on the World Trade Center at the end of Falling Man, by contrast, leaves [the protagonist] Keith Neudecker where he is at the book\u2019s beginning: witnessing a white shirt falling from the sky\u201d (118). This leaves both writer and reader in a bind of sorts. We are left where we started, and herein lies the failure and success of DeLillo\u2019s text. Falling Man, ultimately, is not a grand statement, a sweeping panorama of the American consciousness. Rather, it is a muted cry, showcasing the fragments and silences, capturing the gaps and ghostly minutiae of a few anesthetized individuals. Therefore, DeLillo\u2019s novel encompasses the true American zeitgeist, the \u201cnew normal\u201d following this tragedy, where Americans are stunned into picking up the shattered pieces and attempting to continue on with their lives in an uncertain future. Falling Man opens directly after the first plane hits. Keith Neudecker, a lawyer in one of the towers, makes his way \u201cthrough the rubble and mud,\u201d where \u201cpeople [are] running past holding towels to their faces and jackets over their heads\u201d (DeLillo 3), where he eventually arrives at the apartment of his estranged wife, Lianne. Through a microscopic lens DeLillo follows these individuals as they attempt to piece their lives back together. Lianne hopes they start over again as a family, that this event will bring them closer together. Keith later becomes sexually involved with Florence, the woman whose briefcase he inadvertently grabs on his way out of the building. The sexual connection, though, is not driven by passion but an emotional fusion of their mutual traumas. Through this relationship each finds a brief connection\u2014they share something others do not, but, like everything else in the text, this is only temporary as Keith eventually drifts away from both Florence and his family, spending large amounts of time in Las Vegas playing poker and feeling nothing. He is there but not there; his future as husband and father is left dangling, fading into the background under the weight of the event. Other individuals are brief, ghostly composites. Keith and Lianne\u2019s son, Justin (along with his playmates), stare out of a window on the twenty-seventh floor watching for \u201cBill Lawton\u201d\u2014their misapprehension of bin Laden. A group of Alzheimer\u2019s patients whom Lianne tutors by having them write in journals, scribble down thoughts and phrases\u2014fragments\u2014attempting to not only make sense of the event but their past and current lives as well. Each individual carries around trauma and hollowness, as though sleepwalking, anesthetized in his or her current existence, for \u201c[t]here\u2019s an empty space where America used to be\u201d (193). Hovering strangely throughout the text is a performance artist named \u201cFalling Man,\u201d who visually recreates the image of people falling from the towers using a harness to suspend himself in mid-air. A panel discussion at a university argues whether Falling Man is a \u201cHeartless exhibitionist or Brave New Chronicler of the Age of Terror\u201d (220). DeLillo uses the idea of Falling Man as a statement on the creation of art in the wake of horrific events. Is it shameless or exploitive, creating art out of others\u2019 suffering? Is it too soon? Too painful? Is it ultimately up to our artists to represent these events? The only answer is that there is no answer. But the cumulative effect is a mimesis of sorts. The reader feels the numbness, the paralyzing aspect of horror, the fact that there are no answers, no direct way to deal with this event. This position is what has thus far divided critics. Michiko Kakutani reads Falling Man as a text containing \u201ctwo paltry images: one of a performance artist reenacting the fall of bodies from the burning World Trade Center, and one of a self-absorbed man, who came through the fire and ash of that day and decided to spend his foreseeable future playing stupid card games in the Nevada desert\u201d (3). Overall, she states, \u201cFalling Man feels small and unsatisfying and inadequate\u201d (1). What Kakutani does in her review is compare Falling Man to DeLillo\u2019s previous work, especially his magnum opus, Underworld (1997). Whereas Underworld is DeLillo\u2019s love letter to America, spanning decades with a seemingly endless cast of characters and ideas, Falling Man is small and muted, haunted with two predominant themes: trauma and loss. The only way to look at DeLillo\u2019s 9/11 novel is in the context of other 9/11 novels. DeLillo can no longer write his previous way; he can no longer satirically comment about the consumer culture and its ramifications as he masterfully did in 1985 with White Noise. He, along with America, is traumatized, and this trauma is illustrated in the muted actions and silences, the sparse prose and fragments that make up Falling Man. Most of the time Keith Neudecker looks out \u201cwith a gaze that had no focus in it\u201d (DeLillo 87); in bed with Lianne he \u201csometimes\u2026seemed on the verge of saying something, a sentence fragment, that was all\u2026\u201d (103). Running into her on the street, Lianne notices this about Keith: \u201c[t]here was a blankness in his face, but deep, a kind of lost gaze\u2026. She thought the bare space he stared into must be his own\u2026\u201d (167). Florence, Keith\u2019s brief lover, \u201ctalk[s] into her silence\u2026another kind of eternity, the stillness in her face and body outside time\u201d (157). What DeLillo does with his prose, these characters, is showcase a new mode of expression, something he began working on in The Body Artist (2001), and what he continues with in his latest novel, Point Omega (2010). Frank Rich sees the new DeLillo in Falling Man, noting that \u201c[h]umor is not this novel\u2019s calling card\u201d (1). Unlike Kakutani, who emphasizes the limiting view of the text, Rich notes that \u201cFalling Man, up until its remarkable final sequence, is all oblique silences and enigmatic close-ups\u2026. In DeLillo\u2019s hands, this is not at all limiting or prosaic. There\u2019s a method to the Resnais-like fogginess. The cumulative effect is devastating, as DeLillo in exquisite increments lowers into an inexorable rendezvous with raw terror\u201d (1). This terror includes a frightening, claustrophobic look into the tower\u2019s stairwell after the plane has hit: They had to wait at times, long stalled moments, and he looked straight ahead. When the line moved again he took a step down and then another. They talked to him several times, different people, and when this happened he closed his eyes, maybe because it meant he didn\u2019t have to reply. (DeLillo 244) DeLillo has missteps within the text but they are few. His portrayal of Mohamed Atta, a terrorist who ends up on one of the planes, feels stilted and forced. Also, one of the text\u2019s main strengths\u2014its mutedness\u2014comes close to overwhelming. What do we do when we can do nothing? How do we break out of our nightmares, deal with our traumas? These instances are overshadowed, however, by DeLillo\u2019s crystalline prose. Memory is a thing one cannot escape from. The event is always there in the forefront, shadowing everything we do. Keith thinks of Florence and their brief affair: \u201c[h]e\u2019d thought of it in a remote way, like landscape, like thinking of going back to the house where you grew up and walking along the back lanes and across the high meadow, the kind of thing you know you\u2019ll never do\u201d (227). What DeLillo has done in Falling Man is showcase the \u201cnew normal\u201d in America. No longer are we a country untouched by terror. We now live in a new, scarier world. In an essay published two months after September 11, DeLillo remarks: We like to think that America invented the future. We are comfortable with the future, intimate with it. But there are disturbances now, in large and small ways, a chain of reconsiderations. Where we live, how we travel, what we think about when we look at our children. For many people, the event has changed the grain of the most routine moment. (7) What, ultimately, will come from this change? With our own tragedy will our empathy for others increase? DeLillo, in Falling Man, has given us memory, intimately showcasing our disturbances through the lives of a few people which, in turn, reflects on us as a whole. ...more Unnecessary 9-11 book.

Here's my review from the Greenwich Time last year: Review of \u201cFalling Man\u201d by Don DeLillo, published May 20, 2007 On 9/11, more than 200 people reportedly jumped to their deaths from the World Trade Center buildings, and this after facing an unfathomable choice: Remain in the building and die from the fire; or jump out the window and die from the fall. On 9/12, newspapers worldwide carried an Associated Press photograph of a man in a white shirt and black pants, falling headfirst and straight down, looking (dare I say) composed and determined. In his face I read stoic resolve: a man who'd been forced to make a decision, and who would now die with the consequences. Is this interpretation off base? Is it wishful thinking to attribute a superhuman attitude to such a hellish situation? Maybe. But when you consider the preternatural willpower required to purposely steer a plane into a building, causing the deaths of thousands of innocent victims, then doesn't it stand to reason that response to this action could be equally exceptional? If the world can create a Mohamed Atta, it can also create a \"Falling Man,\" the name given to the unidentified man whose death-scene photograph unnerved millions of people worldwide. This poignant picture was disdained as tacky, voyeuristic, and disrespectful of a terrorist victim who'd been forced to make a terrible decision. When so many readers complained about its perceived insensitivity, newspapers agreed to stop running it -- an instance of self-censorship that seems to have rankled New York City native Don DeLillo, author of \"Underworld\" and \"Falling Man,\" which came out May 1 (Scribner, $26). For his new novel, DeLillo created a fictional performance artist named David Janiak, who uses a rope and safety harness to recreate the iconic pose of \"Falling Man,\" dangling himself from prominent buildings and structures throughout New York City in the days and weeks after 9/11. As people try to regain a sense of normalcy (and perhaps, to forget what happened), this performance artist serves to remind the residents, including Keith Neudecker, a 39-year-old lawyer who worked at the World Trade Center and survived the attack. Before 9/11, Keith and his wife, Lianne, have been separated for a year-and-a-half. Besides poker and his 6-year-old son, Justin, Keith seems to have no human interests. He's an automaton, who plays at a table in his department, and always with the same five guys, several of whom will die or be injured in the attacks. Lianne, meanwhile, is a freelance book editor, who works with Alzheimer's patients and is paranoid that she, like her father, will develop the mind-crippling disease. \"My father shot himself so I would never have to face the day when he failed to know who I was,\" she says at one point. DeLillo paints this as an admirable decision, akin to the decision made by jumpers at the World Trade Center. It's about taking life into your own hands, and to ignore these scenarios, i.e., to call the newspaper or television station and ask them to stop discussing issues or to stop transmitting images, is to live in denial. If the media kowtows to this pressure, DeLillo is saying that citizens must rely on art and artists for the unvarnished truth. \"A man was dangling there, above the street, upside down,\" Lianne observes. \"He wore a business suit, one leg bent up, arms at his sides. A safety harness was barely visible, emerging from his trousers at the straightened leg and fastened to the decorative rail of the viaduct. She'd heard of him, a performance artist known as Falling Man. He'd appeared several times in the last week, unannounced, in various parts of the city, suspended from one or another structure, always upside down, wearing a suit, a tie and dress shoes. He brought it back, of course, those stark moments in the burning towers when people fell or were forced to jump.\" The question, of course, is whether New Yorkers and the world need to be reminded about the horrors of 9/11. Have the memories all faded? And is reading this novel (or any novel, for that matter) the best means of remembering? In terms of the number of victims, the 2001 terrorist attacks affected Greenwich more than any other community in Connecticut. As a reporter, I attended three funerals one Saturday and contributed to more than a dozen memorial stories. My wife, who was in the Empire State Building that day and witnessed people jumping from the World Trade Center, had nightmares for months and still can't watch one second of 9/11 footage. The memories may not be raw, but they're still vivid. The images conjured by DeLillo, however, mostly pale in comparison. Having lived in close, but not intimate, proximity to 9/11, I found his novel unengaging. The characters emerge as types, created to advance a particular theme in his overall picture of 9/11. And so we have Keith, the man who survives the attacks and then becomes increasingly self-absorbed; a fellow survivor named Florence, who's the only one who can relate to Keith's experience; and a Brit named Martin, who's Lianne's mother's long-time lover, and who advances the reasons why America was attacked. With these \"people\" in play, we get exchanges like this: \"They attack out of panic,\" Nina, Lianne's mother, says. Martin: \"This much, yes, it may be true. Because they think the world is a disease. This world, this society, ours. A disease that's spreading.\" Nina: \"There are no goals they can hope to achieve. They're not liberating a people or casting out a dictator. Kill the innocent, only that.\" Martin: \"They strike a blow to this country's dominance. They achieve this, to show how a great power can be vulnerable. A power that interferes, that occupies.\" And he adds, \"One side has the capital, the labor, the technology, the armies, the agencies, the cities, the laws, the police and the prisons. The other side has a few men willing to die.\" That reads less like a conversation and more like a dissertation. I'm paraphrasing, but the conclusion to this thesis would seem to be, \"We don't know how this war between Western values and Islamic fanaticism is going to end, but you can bet that a lot of people will die some terrible deaths before it does.\" Is it important to recognize and remember that? Of course. But in order to do that, must you read a 246-page book? That's debatable.

Also, these characters (other than the token terrorist) don't really exist in systems -- like the academy (White Noise), the football program (Endgame), the music industry (Great Jones Street), the plot to kill JFK (Libra), those touched by a particular baseball (Underworld) -- and so the characters hardly seem to exist (maybe that's the point of the unoccupied floating shirt at the end?). When the terrorist's plane goes into the building the POV switches in the middle of a paragraph to Keith, suggesting that the terrorist's intentionally voided humanity is transferred from Jihadist to an American office worker? But maybe that transfer comes too late? Or maybe it's too conveninent and sort of way too subtle a suggestion -- but if true to the author's intention, that transfer parries critiques that all characters seem like particularly DeLillo-brand semi-unhuman humans, mainly because everyone speaks the same suggestively clipped DeLillon English -- this doesn't bother me when the exposition throughout is high-art fireworks and we're happily immersed in DeLillo World, but here the prose is not so rockin' on every page, we're not exactly immersed, or more so we're skimming the surface? Plus, because these unrealish, not particularly particular characters aren't necessarily cast as \"cogs in a machine,\" volitionless servants of fatality, their inhumanity doesn't suggest some hefty theme related to contemporary humanity? A \"survivors of the stairwells\" system isn't worked up well enough, same with \"terrorized citizens of the NYC grid\" system, again, compared to systems in the other books. Not that DD always needs to deal with these systems, just that it seems like that's the territory he's claimed, it's where he's planted his flag -- and it seems like if he worked another two or three years on this one, he'd more clearly squeeze some complexities out of the current draft and reveal a couple of hermaneutically bad-ass, heretofore-concealed matrices? Not sure I'm making sense. What I mean is: this one isn't as spare as \"The Body Artist\" -- its body actually has all sorts of stubby thematic limbs growing from it, and it'd've been awesome if these limbs evolved and grew hands and took hold of other hands so it could hug itself tight. Or, alternately, if the stubs were severed and sanded clean. Anyway, I'd say: two stars plus one for various passages of sheer DeLillo-y goodness. ...more Detriti. Polvere. Macerie. Morte.

So, having another opportunity to review a book, I decided to re-read this one, since I had conflicting thoughts. Second read, same as the first, and here's my new review: -- Since 1997\u2019s sprawling Underworld , Don DeLillo has taken a decidedly laconic turn, producing three succinct works that focus heavily on style. Eschewing multiple well-drafted characters and their interwoven plots and subplots, his post-millennial preference seems to be instead for theoretical investigations of such lofty concepts as materialism, time, art and existence. And while this worked in The Body Artist and Cosmopolis , there\u2019s something incongruous about a terse, minimalistic novel exploring the most media-fraught event in history, an event we all witnessed and reviewed ad nauseum less than six years prior to the book\u2019s publication. Though Falling Man begins with clouds of smoke and rubble, glass, blood, and much chaos, it feels familiar and even pass\u00e9 to our desensitized psyches. Stylistically, the novel is a success. Its opening scene is frantic--it\u2019s built of short, staccato clauses and is indeed, outside of any historical context, quite harrowing. Chaos has descended; people run in reverse and wear shoes on their hands. Down is up, all is \u201cfalling ash and near night.\u201d At the center of this is Keith Neudecker, a 39-year-old lawyer who has just escaped from the towers. Keith observes, somewhat coolly, the madness, while making his way to the apartment of his estranged wife. Once reunited, the couple progress toward eventual sexual congress, and Keith also falls into a brief affair with a fellow 9/11 survivor named Florence. In both cases, however, the sex is nothing more than an attempt to gain comprehension, and is hardly intimate. Intercourse seems to be the only way two individuals might hope to connect, and DeLillo\u2019s characters engage obligingly, remaining void of all gratification, both sexual and revelatory. In the novel\u2019s most remarkable scene, a gaggle of women test department store mattresses for purchase. They bounce up and down, shedding coats and shoes, their falling bodies evoking both sex and death, a familiar duality in DeLillo\u2019s work. Here again, though, the sex is absurd, ersatz, and partnerless. Not surprisingly, the scene climaxes in impotent, confused violence when Keith starts a fist fight with a stranger. This fundamental human disconnect is a cornerstone of DeLillo\u2019s fiction, though here the failure to communicate discloses a fundamental shortcoming. Struggling to comprehend the terrorists\u2019 actions, each character speaks of them in muddled, ineffectual generalities, suggesting a lack of understanding on the author\u2019s part. \u201cThose men who did this thing. They\u2019re anti everything we stand for,\u201d Lianne laments. Even Martin, the novel\u2019s would-be sage, offers little real insight. An art dealer with nothing on his walls, he remains mysterious and underdeveloped, a far cry from White Noise \u2019s Murray Jay Siskind. His hip nihilism feels reductive, his observations lazy and convenient. \u201cI don\u2019t know this America anymore,\u201d he says before disappearing from the novel (and the country--he sells his New York apartment and retreats to one of his many European residences), \u201cI don\u2019t recognize it. There\u2019s an empty space where America used to be.\u201d It\u2019s not that simple, though--it can\u2019t be--and a reader expects more than this sort of idle observation from someone of DeLillo\u2019s stature. Possible sources of wisdom abound in the novel, though all ultimately disappoint. While the children in White Noise and Underworld are frequent providers of insight as poignant as their adult counterparts\u2019, Keith and Lianne\u2019s son Justin is nothing more than an amalgamation of strange habits. The most significant of these is his consciously monosyllabic speech, and while this stilted diction works thematically within the novel, it certainly isn\u2019t enough to make for an engaging character. Also frustratingly underdeveloped are DeLillo\u2019s three brief ventures into the terrorists\u2019 lives. He claims to have felt an obligation to include this in the novel, and the scant passages indeed feel obligatory. We\u2019re not sure whether Hammad\u2019s lingering doubt is sincere, or if it\u2019s merely indicative of a refusal on the author\u2019s part to accept that these attacks were carried out with completely clear consciences. The novel gets its name from a performance artist who begins staging public free-falls shortly after the collapse of the towers. What commentary he hopes to provide beyond simple controversy--which he most definitely stirs--is unclear, though. The man\u2019s use of a safety harness renders his performances all but innocuous; he hides behind a layer of artifice, much like DeLillo uses style to distract from a lack of real wisdom concerning the attacks. By the end of the novel, Keith has left his wife and child again for the Las Vegas poker circuit. He aims simply \u201cto rake in chips and stack them,\u201d to reverse the towers\u2019 fall, to control fate, to rebuild. Following her mother\u2019s death, Lianne begins to doubt her own physical and spiritual health, and spends her time in doctor\u2019s offices and church pews. In the novel\u2019s chronological conclusion, she accepts Keith\u2019s departure, though her epiphany is abrupt and insincere, comprising a single final sentence. The reader is then thrust back to the towers for a spectacular finale, but is left with no greater understanding of the event. Given DeLillo\u2019s irrefutable knack for astute, even prognostic cultural insight, Falling Man \u2019s frivolous nihilism is perplexing. Its observations are rich, well-crafted, and evocative, but are accompanied by a complete dearth of interpretation. Perhaps an insufficient amount of time has passed to allow for this insight, though considering this is hardly the first novel to tackle the subject--Updike, Foer, McInerney, and McEwan, among others, have all taken their stab-- Falling Man brings surprisingly little to the table. ...more \"O Grande Romance do 11 de Setembro\"...
