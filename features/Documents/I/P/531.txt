You're a bit of a novice when it comes to wine and are a little embarrassed to be here because your wallet is that ballistic nylon stuff and not something truly exotic like alligator skin and with that in mind you decide not to ask the sommelier for any help. You browse around the store looking for a bottle of something called David Foster Wallace that was recommended to you by your friend with the alligator skin wallet. You manage to find the bottle of DFW and admire the fancy bottle with its fancy label and its curlicues and footnotes and excellent leading. The bottle seems really heavy and big and everyone has told you how excellent it is. So you decide to try it but when you actually get to the counter you discover that you've picked up a bottle of something called <---A>George Saunders</---A> by mistake. The George Saunders bottle isn't as big or as fancy as the DFW and in fact it looks a little bit like a down-market or off-label knock-off of the vintage DFW but at the same time you believe that there is maybe something authentic and distinct about it anyway. The sommelier gives you a funny look as he rings you up but you don't say anything because you don't want to look stupid in front of him and anyway you're probably just being self-conscious about the whole thing like the time you had a glass of Pynchon at your friend's house and you said that it was a good Vonnegut and everyone laughed and your friend explained that the Vonnegut has a much sharper finish and you'll notice how the Pynchon seems to hang around in your mouth so much longer but he could see how you might make that mistake. And you try to think about that night on your drive home because it's that same friend with the alligator skin wallet that is coming over for dinner tonight with his wife and you remember how he plays golf with your boss and this is an important event to get right. So that night before the main course you pour everyone's glass in the kitchen so that no one will see the bottle and the secret will be safe with you. And your wife brings out the entree and you bring out the wine and everyone digs in and finds it delicious. Your friend with the alligator skin wallet remarks on how delicious the wine is and did you have any trouble finding the David Foster Wallace at the store? And was the sommelier there helpful? And what year did he recommend because this is really really quite good? And you smile and try to decide whether or not to say anything because you know that you'll need to say something but how are you going to make up something plausible on the spot. But then your wife blurts out that it's really a George Saunders and don't you just love it? Because she slurped down her glass of George Saunders and it was her third of the night anyway because she and your friend's wife managed to down a whole bottle of David Sedaris as a warm-up but they both agreed it was too dry for them even though you and your friend think that it's the perfect middle-of-the-week wine. For a moment you're paralyzed with fear because this was your shot, your chance to show off and really shine and display your competence and you blew it because you were too chicken shit to tell the sommelier at the counter that you picked up the wrong bottle by mistake. But instead your friend raises an eyebrow and says that it's wonderful,<---M> just delightful</---M>, and he'd never tried it before and though maybe it's not as dry as the DFW, does it ever have a great finish and it's just perfect for a dinner party, isn't it? ...more I think that if the arrangement of this collection had been reversed I would be singing a different tune right now, but as it stands I am a bit torn regarding rating this thing.<---F> Man, these stories are well-written</---F>.

Man, these stories are well-written. Saunders is darkly witty, and clearly his heart is in the right place. His main point of contention with the modern world is the reckless hammer of Capitalism, an easy target to be sure, but that is arguably all the more reason to call it into question. The injuries that it inflicts are almost universally felt. In <+++>Pastoralia</+++> , Saunders has created a series of near-future worlds sprinkled with Dystopian and Horror elements, in which the voyeuristic tendencies and indiscriminately exploitative undercurrents of modern society are heightened in such a way that they become grossly comical. The name of the game is satire, and he pulls out all the stops while driving home just how pathetically isolating, spirit-breaking, and hedon-making the process of staying above water in today's Western World has become for its majority. Saunders has the panache of a Gilliam, Burgess, or Huxley, most effectively executed in the phenomenal title story which composes the first half of the book. However, his sardonic message eventually gets to feeling a bit redundant, and the stories seem to grow weaker and weaker as you move forward. For one, he is not really in the habit of crafting likeable characters. This is not generally a deal-breaker for me (if you know me on gr, that should be clear enough), but it begins to feel short-sighted after a while. Then again, I suppose that if you continuously grind a person down, there eventually won't be much left other than his or her most vile, base desires and tendencies. Enter George Saunders... I dunno; maybe the novella <+++>Pastoralia</+++> just outshines the rest of the stories by far too many watts. Still, the collection is a fast and surprisingly breezy read for its dark content. I would strongly recommend Saunders to anyone with a stomach of steel and the heart of a cynic. Or anyway, that's me, and I thought this was pretty damn good indeed. *Just imagine a fourth star, but its bulb is perpetually burning out in that way that makes it erratically flicker on and off. Deal? ...more Based on the opinions of people with excellent taste in books, I knew I was in for something good when I grabbed Pastoralia from the shelf the other day.

I didn't know what to expect beyond that but it sure wasn't the sardonic giggles this collection gave me. Does everyone find their first foray into Saunders's mind this darkly endearing? 'Cause.... lemme tell you, you all led me somewhere I can't wait to revisit. There is something off about the worlds Saunders creates. Not off-the-charts unbelievably weird (view spoiler) [(yeah, he makes the reanimated, telekinetic and downright draconian corpse of a once-beloved aunt seem like a thing that could totally happen because he's that good and, as a character observed, maybe it does happen all the time but who would believe it so why bother with the crazy-talk and risk everyone thinking that you've finally gone 'round the bend?) (hide spoiler) ] but there's this vertiginous element to them that makes being jarred from such a mercilessly absorbing reading experience by, say, the unwelcome intrusion of your job ( whyyyyyyy do you people keep assuming I'm here to proofread your ineptitude when I'm so clearly lost in something that is infinitely more rewarding than your refusals to grasp the nuances of proper comma usage and pica distances WHYYYY? ) a little disorienting upon reentry. I encountered a thing that doesn't happen often enough while reading this short-story collection: I forgot I was reading because I was so engrossed in the tales Saunders was weaving. Picturing the story that was taking shape right in front of me was equal parts riveting and really quite disturbing. Kind of like the clown car on fire that you'll snap photos of as you pass the gruesome scene but fuck no you're not stopping to help because it's a car full of clowns and everyone knows that clowns are evil but then the sadness of the whole thing hits you when you post the picture (along with an appropriately glib comment) on Twitter later but you're still snickering about the image for days. And then there is something distinctly, deliciously Vonnegut-flavored here, too, but Saunders even makes that all his own. While Vonnegut's humor seemed like that of a cranky but avuncular relative whose lessons seem harsh at the time but are driven by an overriding love and a desire to emphasize the necessity of self-improvement, who softens the blow of reality with a satirical wit, Saunders seems more interested in pointing out the flaws so they can be turned into a long-running joke that derives its comedy from the dichotomy between a thing's inherent potential for dark humor and the deadpan subtlety in observing it from such an angle. It's realizing the hopelessness of a situation and having a good laugh at its expense because, otherwise, the void wins and everything is rendered too meaningless to face just one more insignificant day. Pastoralia , ultimately, is a collection of stories that proves if you're taking life too seriously, you're doing it all wrong. Tragedy is just comedy that tests your resolve to arrive at the punchline. ...more Like other folks I know and respect on Goodreads, I loved the opening, titular story but found the rest of the book to be middling. Like, disappointingly, forgettably, middling. I know the stories were kinda weird and stuff but for the life of me I can barely even remember what they were about or even distinguish them from each other.

I don't think I've ever felt so uneven about a short story collection. It's so strange that it makes me curious enough to give them a reread at some point, despite the less than flattering description I've just given. I feel like I must have read them incorrectly somehow, since the opening story was so engaging and fun, which is where the four three stars come from. I love books and films that utilize facades and museum-like tableaux and the story \"Pastoralia\" does this with great effect. This quality plus the cover image of my copy of this book has established itself so firmly in my mind that when I see things like fake trees indoors or big landscape/nature murals (think of the paintings placed around City Hall on the TV show Parks and Recreation ) that I think of them as being \"Saunders-like\" in the instant-association segment of my brain. I haven't yet totally over-analyzed what my attraction to certain uses of facades and replicas is all about yet ( though there's been a more extended musing on this elsewhere ) but I guess it might just have something to do with fond childhood memories of visiting museums and being enthralled by the displays of animals and humans, made to be lifelike but frozen into place behind glass. I still experience a powerful mix of sentimentality with a healthy dose of Ineffability when I revisit the Milwaukee Public Museum, a place I've wandered around many times over the years, each time worrying that I'll drain the magic of the childhood memories on this visit, but each time managing to still feel wrapped in an almost mystical euphoria and nostalgia. Saunders tale is surreal and dark and playful and some of its main devices called this feeling up from the inner depths. This is still the only Saunders I've read. I assumed his work would be so up my alley that I ordered three of his short story collections last year, had my weirdly uneven experience with this one and haven't exactly felt compelled to make the others a priority yet. I still have a sense that I'll like more of his work, but this experience was just such a strange disappointment in a way I can't really explain at all. At least I have a case to solve now, so I'll be back to Saundersville to snoop around for clues and answers later. ...more ''His childhood dreams had been so bright, he had hoped for so much, it couldn't be true that he was a nobody.'' These stories, wacky as they may be, don't paint a very flattering portrait of modern life.

These stories, wacky as they may be, don't paint a very flattering portrait of modern life. A father takes a job as a grunting caveman at a run-down theme park in order to pay his son's exorbitant medical bills. A male stripper earns a meagre wage to support his ungrateful family, who spend their day watching reality TV like How My Child Died Violently and The Worst That Could Happen, a show of computer-generated tragedies. A desperate coward attends a New Age seminar, where is told to repeat the mantra \"Now Is the Time for Me to Win!\" and to remove his mentally ill sister from his home in order to achieve his goals. The American Dream hasn't really happened for these characters. They're all a bunch of sad-sacks and nobodies who fantasise about the life they might have had. Any flicker of hope exists only inside their own heads and they're either delusional or too afraid to do anything about it. Saunders has a knack of pointing out the absurdities of modern existence. He sets up these surreal scenarios which initially sound unlikely, but the more you think about them, the more you realise they are not that far removed from life today. Though I personally preferred his Tenth of December collection, Pastoralia is a book of twisted, grimly funny satire from a visionary writer. ...more Any person who does not deeply love George Saunders is not allowed to be my friend. Even a little bit. I finished this last night when I couldn't sleep ... I adore George Saunders in small doses, he is so very funny and has such an ear for the pathos of our sad American industrial poverty. But there's a kind of story that he writes over and over again ... not exactly the same story but the same kind of story.

A story about a hilariously awful job, a hilariously difficult life and a sad, pathetic person stuck within. I don't even object to the repetition, but when I read it all back to back the relentless pessimism and bitterness overtook the comedy and I found myself just plain depressed. Is that so bad? Is that my fault or his? Should I give more stars to a happier book? Are they Prozac stars? I don't know, stars are stupid. Short stories are not at their best compressed into collections. Any of these stories is great on its own. (Though I preferred the shorter version of \"Pastoralia\" printed in the New Yorker to the extended-play version here.) So maybe you should get this book and schedule it out, maybe read one story a month over the next summer.

Think of the cartoon strip, The Far Side, in story form and you\u2019ll get the idea of what his writing is like. His stories are weird and funny, with a pronounced absurdist edge to them. Saunders often populates his stories with a menagerie of misfits who are life\u2019s punching bags. While their struggles are played for laughs, there is, at times, an underlying pathos to his character\u2019s determined efforts to remain optimistic in the face of a cosmos equally determined to give them metaphorical wedgies. In the end, however, life usually grinds them down and even death doesn\u2019t bring relief: \u201cWe bury her at St. Leo\u2019s, on the hill up near BastCo. Her part of the graveyard\u2019s pretty plain. No angels, no little rock houses, no flowers, just a bunch of flat stones like parking bumpers and here and there a Styrofoam cup. Father Brian says a prayer and then one of us is supposed to talk. But what\u2019s there to say? She never had a life. Never married, no kids, work, work, work. Sometimes she comes to me in dreams. She never looks good. Sometimes she\u2019s wearing a dirty smock. Once she had on handcuffs. Once she was naked and dirty and this mean cat was clawing it\u2019s way up her front. But every time it\u2019s the same thing. \u201cSome people get everything and I got nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy? Why did that happen?\u201d Every time I say I don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t\u201d Sauders is a savage satirist and takes careful aim at American society. One of his frequent motifs is the seedy amusement park as a microcosm for America. The title story is yet another foray into that theme. Pastorlia is a historical amusement park where living people play act in dioramas of the past. As a threatened restructuring looms, the story becomes a Dilbert-like skewering of corporate culture: \u201cAnd in terms of mass firings, relax, none are forthcoming, truly, and furthermore, if they were, what you\u2019d want to ask yourself is: Am I Thinking Positive/Saying Positive? Am I giving it all I\u2019ve got? Am I doing even the slightest thing wrong? But not to worry. Those of you who have no need to be worried should not in the least be worried. As for those who should be worried, it\u2019s a little late to start worrying now, you should have started months ago, when it could\u2019ve done you some good, because at this point, what\u2019s decided is decided, or would have been decided, if those false rumors we are denying, the rumors about the firings which would be starting this week if they were slated to begin, were true, which we have just told you, they aren\u2019t\u201d I liked the book, but it\u2019s not for everyone. The stories are often freakish and bizarre, filled with satire sharp enough to draw blood and a bleak view of American society. Saunders does have a unique voice and an original style, but I have to admit I did find his 1st book, CivilWarLand in Bad Decline, to be somewhat repetitive, largely due to four of the stories being set in amusement parks. There\u2019s a little more variation in setting and themes in this collection and even a couple of stories that could be considered to have \u201chappy endings\u201d or what passes for a happy ending in Saunder\u2019s world view. ...more \u2018Pastoralia\u2019 (the opening story) shows what Saunders can do.

Almost two decades before George Saunders published the everybody's-talking-about-it book, Lincoln in the Bardo, he published Pastoralia.

Pastoralia is a collection of six short stories, and they are some of the weirdest, bleakest, and most well-written ones I've ever encountered. As I worked through (struggled through) each one of them, I kept asking myself, \"Are these dystopian?\" I tend to think of \"dystopian\" as futuristic, or containing more futuristic elements, of government-imposed rations, restrictions, etc, and these stories are not like that. However, when I looked up the actual definition of the adjective \"dystopian,\" this is what I found: \"relating to or denoting an imagined place or state in which everything is unpleasant or bad, typically a totalitarian or environmentally degraded one.\" Okay. So, yes, they're dystopian. The first one, Pastoralia, the lead story of the collection, is the longest and the weirdest. I think his editor made a mistake placing this is the first position. I found the story beyond quirky and unrelatable, and I would have been done with the entire collection after this weird tale, had I not told my sister I would read this book. The second, third and fourth stories were so dark and depressing, I wished I'd had a cup of Kool-Aid and a cyanide capsule to go along with the book. Reading about the people in these stories is like having a nightmare in which a former reality-tv host is the president of the most powerful country in the world, and waking up to discover it's true. In the fifth and sixth stories, I finally got to sit back a little and think, \"Damn, Mr. Saunders, when you're not depressing the hell out of me, you can be funny and a little bit romantic, too. It made me hopeful to read Lincoln in the Bardo. But, of course, the last sentence of the collection left me sucker-punched in the gut. Who is this guy? I'm hesitant to recommend this, unless you're a reader who likes to smack your shoulders up against the edge, or if good writing supercedes all else for you. Four stars for excellent writing, originality and memorable, though disturbing perspectives on humanity. . . that I hope, despite our current despair, are not true. ...more Herkes bir kaybeden bu kitapta.

Dark. Cynical. Horrific. And, yet, these stories possess a level of truth in each one that resonates long after the story ends. Simply put: George Saunders is brilliant.

I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted illegally.) I had the pleasure of getting to talk with legendary author George Saunders for CCLaP's podcast last week , a rare treat given how in demand he is on this latest tour even among the major media; but that meant I had to do some serious cramming in the few weeks leading up to our talk, in that (I guiltily confess) I only became aware of his existence a month ago, because of a passionate recommendation from my friend and Chicago science-fiction author Mark R. Brand, with Saunders' new book, tour, and interview opportunity being merely a fortuitous coincidence. And that's because the vast majority of Saunders' output has been short stories, while regulars know that my own reading habits veer almost 100 percent to full novels, which means he's simply and unfortunately been off my radar this whole time; but of course I'm happy to make room in my life for exquisite short-fiction writers once I learn about them (see for example my revelation after reading John Cheever for the first time a few years ago), which means that I tore through all seven books now of his career in just a few weeks recently, so I thought I'd get one large essay posted here about all of them at once, instead of doing a separate small review for each book. And indeed, as I mentioned during the podcast as well, like Cheever I think Saunders' work is going to be at its most powerful once his career is over, and all the stories collected into one giant volume that a person reads all at once, instead of debating the merits of one individual collection over another. And in fact this is something else I said in the podcast, that I find it fun to think of Saunders' stories as essentially interchangeable tales in one big comic-book-style shared universe, albeit the most f-cked-up shared universe you'll ever spend time in: a possibly post-apocalyptic America, although whether through slow erosion or one big doomsday event is hard to determine, where the only businesses that still thrive are outlandish theme parks designed for the amusement of the now \"natural betters\" of our new Mad Max society, and staffed by the permanent class of have-nots which now includes a large population of genetically modified freaks, a place where ghosts are real and magic exists and the new normal is extreme cruelty at all times for all other humans left in the wreckage of a crumbled United States. And so if you look at the four story collections that Saunders has now put out -- 1996's CivilWarLand in Bad Decline , 2000's Pastoralia , 2006's In Persuasion Nation and this year's Tenth of December -- you'll see that the vast majority of all these pieces fit at least somewhat into the general paradigm just described, although with others that are much more realistic in tone but still with the same unbelievable cruelty and darkness, many of them set among racially tense situations in eroding post-industrial cities. Yeah, sounds like a big barrel of laughs, right? And in fact this was the biggest surprise for me as well when first reading them, that Saunders is not just on the stranger side of the bizarro* subgenre, but is one of the most wrist-slashingly depressing authors you will ever find, yet this Guggenheim and MacArthur grant winner is regularly on the bestseller lists, has appeared on David Letterman and The Daily Show , gets published on a steady basis in such hugely mainstream magazines as The New Yorker and GQ , and is adored by literally millions of fans out there, many of whom would never open the cover of a book from Eraserhead Press to save their life. And that's because Saunders never talks about these things specifically to be depressing, but rather as a way of highlighting how important simple humanity is to our lives, the simple act of being humane and optimistic about the world, which he does not by writing about the humane acts themselves but what a world without them would look like. And that's a clever and admirable thing to do, because it means he sneaks in sideways to the points he wants to make, not beating us over the head but forcing us to really stop and think about what he's truly trying to say, to examine why we get so upset when this fundamental humanity is missing from the stories we're reading. Ultimately Saunders believes in celebrating life, in trying to be as helpful and open-minded to strangers as you can, in being as positive about the world at large as you can stand; but like the Existentialists of Mid-Century Modernism, he examines this subject by looking at worst-case scenarios, and by showing us what exactly we miss out of in life when this positivity and love is gone. *(For those who are new to CCLaP, \"bizarro\" is a hard-to-define term but one we reference here a lot; also sometimes known as \"gonzo\" fiction, sometimes as \"The New Weird,\" a lot of it comes from either the wackier or more prurient edges of such existing genres as science-fiction, horror and erotica, while some of it is more like Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs, a conceptual cloud of strangeness that has a huge cult following in the world of basement presses and genre conventions, as well as such literary social networks as Goodreads.com. If you want to think of famous examples, think of people like Kathy Acker, Mark Leyner, Will Self, Chuck Palahniuk, Blake Butler, China Mieville\u2026and, uh, George Saunders!) Now, of course, in all honesty, there are also a few clunkers scattered here and there in these collections as well, which is simply to be expected in a career that now spans twenty years; and when it comes to the small number of other books he's put out besides story collections, I have to confess that I found those to be a much iffier proposition. For example, there's the 2000 children's book The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip , cute enough but as inessential to an adult as any children's book is; then there's his one collection of nonfiction essays, 2007's The Braindead Megaphone , an uneven compilation of random pieces which includes some real gems (one of the best being that GQ piece mentioned, where Saunders is sent George-Plimpton-style to Dubai, and instead of the usual decrying of the ultra-rich he is surprisingly charmed by all the vacationing middle-class families), but that has an equal amount of throwaway pieces done for highly specific commissions; and then there's the only stand-alone fiction book of his career so far, the 2005 novella The Brief and Frightening Reign of Phil , which I have to confess is the only thing of Saunders' career that I actively disliked -- written in the middle of the Bush atrocities, it's obviously an attempt to do an Animal Farm -style satire about those years, but is labored in its execution, too on the nose, and in general has too much of a \"quirky for the sake of being quirky\" vibe, the exact thing that can most quickly kill a piece of bizarro fiction. (But then again, we perhaps shouldn't blame Saunders for this; as I've talked about many times here in the past, it seems that no indignant artist was able to write satirically about Bush in the middle of the Bush Years without producing an overly obvious ranting screed, whether that's Saunders or George Clooney or Michael Moore or Robert Redford. No wonder no good books about Nazis came out until after World War Two; as we all learned in the early 2000s, it's nearly impossible to actually live under a fascist regime and also be subtle and clever in your critique of it.) But those are all small quibbles, of course; Saunders' bread and butter is in his short fiction, and I'm convinced that he will eventually be known as one of the best short-fiction authors in history, joining a surprisingly small list that includes such luminaries as Cheever, William Faulkner, Eudora Welty, GK Chesterton and more. Plus, as a fan of edgy and strange work, I'm thrilled that a guy like Saunders is out there, serving as a gateway of sorts between mainstream society and an entire rabbithole of basement-press bizarro titles that's just waiting for newly inspired fans to tumble down. If you're going to pick up your first Saunders book soon, go ahead and pick up the newest, Tenth of December , because it's just as good as all the others and particularly easy to find right now; but I also encourage you to dig deeper into this remarkable author's career, and to see just how far he'll pull you into the murky depths of ambiguous morality before coming bobbing back to the surface. It's been a true treat to become a fan of his work this year, and I urge you to become one as well. Out of 10 ( Tenth of December ): 9.6 ...more Video review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh04b...

Even in In Persuasion Nation, Saunders sounds like a copy of himself--albeit one who has a penchant for a choice image or a biting satire every now and again--but no matter how much I want all modern-day misanthropic literature to go forth and be fruitful, I can't help but get tired of his shtick: (A) take one corporate and yet zany customer service job, (B) fill with one or more well-meaning but socially awkward archetypal loser characters, (C) mix equal parts poor grammar, teenage colloquialisms, humor and thinly-veiled cynicism, and (D) finish strong by peppering the story with a decorative but ultimately useless jumble of science-fiction and/or marketing excreta. It was an interesting read but is probably his weakest collection of stories.

Meaning safety, meaning, is speeding something we do in a vacuum, or could it involve a pedestrian or fatality or a family out for a fun drive, and then here you come, speeding, with safety or destiny of that family not held firmly in your mind, and what happens next?

'Pastoralia' son seis cuentos protagonizados por perdedores que no paran de pisar mierda, perdedores que fantasean con una vida mejor pero que no hacen nada para conseguirla, perdedores que detestan a otros perdedores y se intentan convencer que en realidad ellos no lo son. La moraleja del libro ser\u00eda que nos matamos trabajando en trabajos de mierda que odiamos, trabajamos, trabajamos, trabajamos, somos infelices, trabajamos, trabajamos, trabajamos, somos desgraciados, trabajamos, trabajamos, trabajamos y al final morimos.

Se trata de cuentos que encadenan desgracia tras desgracia, en los cuales la \u00fanica forma que tienen los personajes de no comer tanta mierda es jodiendo a los dem\u00e1s. Parece que no hay salida: si tienes un m\u00ednimo de decencia, no fastidiar\u00e1s mucho m\u00e1s a otro para fastidiarte un poco menos a ti mismo.

Ante tanta acumulaci\u00f3n de desgracias no puedes dejar de pensar que esto en parte es una comedia, que nada va en serio, que es todo co\u00f1a. Pero a la vez sabes que va totalmente en serio, porque as\u00ed es la vida. La mezcla de humor y drama dickensiano es \u00fanica, funciona perfectamente bien.

I've never lived a life outside of late stage capitalism, so I can't say re-read March 2016 Pastoralia , George Saunders' very funny, often sad, mostly easy to read, collection of short stories is a great addition to any MBA reading list. An odd suggestion, perhaps, but one that will prepare future office workers and corporatists for a life of frustrating middle management. Saunders is a chronicler of the middle manager, or of a management ethos very particular to late stage American capitalism. I've never lived a life outside of late stage capitalism, so I can't say for sure, but something about Saunders' writing - his painting of mostly frustrated, stunted, men living lives of quiet desperation - fits very well with my experience of people I've known in the working world. A lot of us have been sold the dream, often by the sneakiest of sales-people, our parents and loved ones, that we're meant for greatness. Instead, most of us find ourselves among other average people. This mismatch makes for fertile ground for a story teller like Saunders. He captures the inner rage of a barber, the fear and shame of an unnamed narrator working in a cave man theme park, the longing of a dead all-to-nice aunt, or people in self-help groups. Some inner working in all these characters made me believe they all had bigger plans, and were left instead to deal with the life they were actually living. If there wasn't this mismatch of how amazing we all think we are and how average most of us turn out to be, would Saunders have much to write about? I'm sure he'd find something. But as long as the world works as it does, we have the benefit of having a writer like George Saunders hold a mirror up to ourselves. ...more It's kind of a funny story... Someone on topicless asked \"What music are you currently addicted to?\" So someone recommended the Matches, who have this song called The Barber's Unhappiness. I got pretty hooked on this song, but was listening to it thinking, this is a really weird song, lyrically. What is all this stuff about twin rose trellises? So I went on songmeanings.net, where if anyone knows anything about what a song is really about, it shall be posted. and indeed, I was pointed to the Georg It's kind of a funny story...

I found it pretty meh, though. There are reviews on the book jacket that compare the guy to Vonnegut and Salinger and/or, I don't remember, other people of note and worth. And I'm thinking... really? You've got to be kidding me. The song has a feel of soulful emptiness. The book is more soulless emptiness. Like, \"Well, here's boring, depressing, lonely real life. Sucks, doesn't it?\" The song is like a scene in a movie where people are having a really serious, worthwhile conversation on a rooftop in the freezing cold in the middle of the night. I kind of knew I'd be disappointed... ...more As much as I hear about Saunders' role as an excoriating satirist of our late-capitalist culture, I'm still not fully convinced. It's not that he's a bad writer-- on the contrary, I was generally impressed with the quality of both his prose and dialogue. And his conceits were, at the very least, amusing, and often rather delightful. But somehow, I keep finding that he's good, not great. And as far as contemporary satire goes, I find Gary Shteyngart far more interesting, probably because he write As much as I hear about Saunders' role as an excoriating satirist of our late-capitalist culture, I'm still not fully convinced.

And his conceits were, at the very least, amusing, and often rather delightful. But somehow, I keep finding that he's good, not great. And as far as contemporary satire goes, I find Gary Shteyngart far more interesting, probably because he writes in a longer form and thus gives you time to care about the characters a bit more (although, let's face it, I find satirical writing to be far less incisive than comedy, and I've gotten more satirical value from any one George Carlin, Chris Rock, or Louis C.K. special than I have from all satirical fiction combined). I still liked Pastoralia better than CivilWarLand in Bad Decline, but I'm not quite 100 percent on the Saunders train yet. ...more I'm doing this from memory, hope I don't leave any out-- \"Pastoralia\" - some interesting ideas (and some all too familiar ones) about human social organization. Too long. \"Winky\" - wacky but one-dimensional. The ending is pretty predictable. \"Sea Oak\" - hysterical and sophisticated, the best story in the book. \"The End of FIRPO in the World\" - very touching and an interesting protagonist, but so short it felt underdeveloped. I wish this story had been much longer. \"The Barber's Unhappiness\" - Some in I'm doing this from memory, hope I don't leave any out-- \"Pastoralia\" - some interesting ideas (and some all too familiar ones) about human social organization.

The conflict, when it comes, is compelling, but I wish it had been sustained a little longer. ...more George Saunders is not an earth human. I liked this collection a lot, esp \"Pastoralia,\" but I liked Tenth of December better because I thought the stories were richer and had more emotional weight!! But overall, luv that G. Saunders. 5 Stars out of 5 Stars I could write forever about how much I enjoyed this book. George Saunders is a modern writer with hysterical, loveable, satirical characters in a world very much believable. The first piece I read by Saunders appears in this book as the title story - and which I'll review below - and it ended up being the gateway to what I believe now is definitely one of my favorite authors. Although I loved each and every story in this collection, Pastoralia is the only one I am going to 5 Stars out of 5 Stars I could write forever about how much I enjoyed this book.

The first piece I read by Saunders appears in this book as the title story - and which I'll review below - and it ended up being the gateway to what I believe now is definitely one of my favorite authors. Although I loved each and every story in this collection, Pastoralia is the only one I am going to highlight in this review. I should stress, though, that this book should be read in entirety ... you don't want to miss any of the stories Saunders weaves. In fact, I am eagerly about to start the next Saunders collection in my possession, Tenth of December. ----- Pastoralia: 5 Stars out of 5 Stars This was the first piece by George Saunders that I had the priveledge of reading ... and boy, did I learn how much I was missing out not reading his work. Not only did this short story have me hooked from beginning to end, it had me laughing out loud and really, truly, invested in the characters. To me, this felt like a real world with real people in some real askew society. A full-legnth novel doesn't always do this for me ... let alone a short story (a writing style, I feel, that is hard to master). Reccomended to anyone and everyone who is looking for a satirical, funny and dysfunctional tale where you'll glimpse into the life of a worker where his higher ups are incompetent - oh yeah, and his job is to sit in a cave and pretend to be a caveman for a historical theme park of sorts. ----- George Saunders is truly a talent unfit to be passed up. His stories are short and sweet - making them perfect to read one at a time if your in a pinch, and enjoyable to read straight through. I highly recommend his work. ...more was on my daughter's reading list for Uni, so read it while she was home. Very quick read too. review coming.. So pissed off!

Now you lot will have to put up with a remembered re-hash which won't be as good of course. Not really my sort of writing being dry and satirical and depending for its effects on tautology and repetition, eg from memory in the title story there\u2019s a fax that makes a noise like a fax machine does when a fax machine starts working, that sort of thing. I did laugh a few times and was moved by the plight of some of the characters, eg in \u2018\u2026Firpo..\u2019 the boy on the bike, or in \u2018The Falls\u2019 where an ordinary guy witnesses an about-to-happen accident and wonders what he should do. Saunders does capture the plain man suffering from the crushing effects of rampant capitalism, eg the male stripper in \u2018Sea Oak\u2019 (I think) being told by his dead aunty to show his cock if he wants to escape poverty. In fact I seem to be talking myself into a higher rating, but on the other hand I do prefer stuff that\u2019s less ironic and more engaging (and in Barry's case no less funny) eg Kyle Minor , or Kevin Barry to take the examples of two recent collections I've read. So I probably won\u2019t be reading any more Saunders. Unless my daughter brings home another example of his oeuvre. ...more<---C>George Saunders</---C>", "Title": "Pastoralia"},
