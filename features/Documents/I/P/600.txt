What some people call Occasional Pieces. Second, the story of the writer and the lady. Or what could be called the general plot of the book. And third the perspective of the lady, her observations and narration of the events of strand two and sometimes opinions of strand one, of which she has been hired to type up for the aging author. Almost every page is split into three sections. Each section corresponding to a different strand. At first the sections neatly frame each of the strands. But then the sections begin to be less contiguous. Some sections are very short and episodic, some go on stretching for multiple chapters. The chapter lengths decided by the length of the essays. Some stories keeping going on and on. The reader has to make a choice, follow the story or follow the pages. The reader must make a choice. There is no way around it. A choice must be made. Inevitably what the reader choses implicates him or her into the crime of authorship. The crime of choice, of discrimination. The book I read and gave four stars to could be the same one physically that you read, but the text inevitably would be radically different. There is little chance you could make the same choices I did. The text would be radically different the next time I read this book. There is little chance I would make the same choices again. I can't help but wonder what the experience would have been to read the book in a different order. To have read the third section through all of the chapters and then return to read the essays, and finally read the story: what would this book have been? I fear falling into a Borgesian trap with contemplation of all the possible texts contained within this one unassuming book. How would Coetzee have wanted this book to be read? I mean how did he perceive his perfect reader to read this book, does he still perceive the perfect reader in the same way? Coetzee,<---M> the author writer</---M>, remains almost silent on the Question within the confines of the book. To go outside of the book and see what he may have said in an interview, what some scholar or that scholar says and thinks, or what another reviewer states would not answer anything. Instead, merely another layer would be added to the text, a barrier would be erected, even though it was meant to be a bridge meant to cross the abyss of distance between the writer, the book, and the reader. Coetzee, the writer, mentions Barthes. He acknowldges the death of the author as figurehead. Of the text as a monolithic totality. Coetzee mentions Focault. By what right do I have to be writing any of this? To be adding my own voice to this book, to any book. To be forcing my way between a person and a book and trying to add my own voice to the resonance of voices. To the white noise of people all trying to add their own nonsense into the din. We are all tyrannical authors, at least in our dreams. Most of us are just lazy authors though, and commit our crimes without the labor of creation. ...more (<---B>Second Version of Triptych 1944, 1988 Francis Bacon</---B>) Reason, observation, and experience; the holy trinity of science.

Robert Green Ingersoll The first question one asks oneself, when starting to read <+++>Diary of a Bad Year</+++> is: is this really fiction? One thing is for sure, its structure is highly innovative. There are two sections: Strong Opinions and The Second Diary which are divided into three continuous streams on each page: Stream 1: A series of mini essays. Stream 2: The narrator's voice, Se\u00f1or C. Stream 3: The voice of Anya. Se\u00f1or C is an ageing author who has Parkinson\u2019s disease and is slowly loosing his vision. He is currently working on a series of essays entitled Strong Opinions to be published in a German literary journal. The subject matter of these mini essays ranges from the state and terrorism; censorship and pornography, to music and authority in fiction. Se\u00f1or C meets a Filipina neighbour called Anya in the laundry room of their apartment tower and despite his failing health, realises that his desires are still alive and kicking. In an effort to be close to her, he offers Anya the job of typing up his essays for his publisher, which she duly accepts. She is cosmopolitan, good looking and provocative, but in a stable relationship with Alan. Nonetheless, a strong bond is formed between Se\u00f1or C and Anya. As Anya finds Se\u00f1or C essays boring, he dedicates a lighter version of his opinions to her entitled The Second Diary . Alan obviously becomes jealous and checks out Se\u00f1or C, discovering that he is rich and sets designs on his bank account. I initially had difficulty getting into this novel , the mini essays on politics, terrorism and the State lacked depth, the excursions into science and mathematics were madcap and only after the first 70 pages did this reading experience really start to take off. What I thought to be a gimmick in structure - forcing the reader to make choices as to how he or she is to read these three simultaneous streams - suddenly turned into a real pleasure, as I discovered the dynamic inner rhythm of these parallel texts and even more so, as the streams became less contained and spilled over onto the following pages. I was also captivated by the very personal and intimate voice of the author as he elucidated topics such as South Africa and apartheid; Bach and music; and the classics and common language use. It was like taking a stroll through the lobes of his brain. On closer examination, one discovers a kind of dichotomy between the responsible, moral and just author of the intellect and the troubled and lascivious author of emotions. The book vacillates between male and female; fiction and non-fiction; age and youth; strong opinions and gentler ones, some of which are of a lesser and others of greater interest. This experimental novel is worth reading just for Coetzee's impressive use of language: Growing detachment from the world is of course the experience of many writers as they grow older, grow cooler or colder. The texture of their prose becomes thinner, their treatment of character and action more schematic. The syndrome is usually ascribed to a waning of creative power; it is no doubt connected with the attenuation of physical powers, above all the power of desire. Yet from the inside the same development may bear a quite different interpretation: as a liberation, a clearing of the mind to take on more important tasks. ...more I read this on the recommendation of a friend, who said that she didn't know anyone else who had read the book and wanted to have someone to talk about it with. I had never heard of it, although JM Coetzee does have several books on The List (not this one, unfortunately, but now I at least want to seek out some more of his work). I also realized, looking over my Goodreads shelves, that this is the first book I've read in 2014 that was written by a man. So take that, patriarchy!

I also realized, looking over my Goodreads shelves, that this is the first book I've read in 2014 that was written by a man. So take that, patriarchy! The format of Diary of a Bad Year is, at first glance, daunting. Each page is divided up into three sections, each representing the viewpoints of a different character. The first section is for the official writings of Senor C, an aging author who is putting together a collection of essays for a book called \"Strong Opinions.\" The second section is Senor C's personal perspective, describing what occurred while he was working on his essays. The third section is for Anya, the woman Senor C hires as a typist. Coetzee starts out easy, dividing each page into just Senor C's essay and his personal narration, and then gradually adds Anya's perspective to the bottom of the page. The three voices share pages for a while, and then gradually things shift. Senor C's essay sections get shorter as the personal perspectives get longer. Sometimes an essay will extend to the second page, leaving you with a choice that another reviewer phrased beautifully: follow the writing, or follow the story? Reading Diary of a Bad Year was, if nothing else, a fun exercise in form, and it's to Coetzee's credit that all three sections remain cohesive and never become too confusing. My biggest problem with this book was Anya - as a character, she's frustrating. Senor C hires her because he thinks she has a great butt and wants an excuse to spend time with her. Anya is aware of this, and is proud of it. She's portrayed pretty shallowly, always talking about how it's important for her to be attractive to men, and she's in a relationship with an older man who left his wife for Anya. The man, Alan, intrudes on the story halfway through (he has some dumb plan about stealing from Senor C's bank account with computers, I don't know) and soon Anya's perspective becomes overshadowed by Alan's presence. Anya starts out disdainful of Senor C, gently mocking him as a silly and slightly creepy old man, but by the end of the book, she thinks of him only with respect and reverence. Anya seemed less like a character and more like the personification of JM Coetzee's personal wish fulfillment - it's such a cliche, the idea of an older male author wanting some young pretty girl to worship him and his writing, but here it is. It was profoundly irritated to me to see Anya start out looking at Senor C with derision, and end with wide-eyed admiration, especially because he hadn't done anything to earn it. It's an interesting book, especially in terms of form, and I enjoyed it despite my issues with Anya. I'll have to keep Coetzee in mind the next time I'm looking for a new book, and see if I have a better experience the second time around. \"Of late, sketching stories seems to have become a substitute for writing them. I think of Gyula and his harem of images. It is one of the consequences of growing older that one no longer needs the thing itself, that the idea of the thing suffices - as, in matters of the heart, the entertainment of a possibility, called ideal love by Gyula but more familiar to ordinary people as flirtation, may become a substitute, a not unwelcome substitute, for love itself?\" ...more coetzee, one of the great living writers, has lost his faith in narrative... in the power of fictional characters and situations to illuminate some kind of truth as it pertains to real life.

El planteamiento de tres relatos simult\u00e1neos no siempre es f\u00e1cil, pero el conjunto es una delicia. Well, that was interesting . This entire book is told in three distinct voices. The first voice is that of an author's book of opinions on the state of the world. It really does make the book feel both fiction and non-fiction . The second voice is that of the author himself, talking about his \"life\" outside of the book he is writing - his actual Diary. The third voice is that of his secretary/typist, Anya, who is transcribing the book for the author, who she calls Senor C - her actual Diary. The boo Well, that was interesting .

The third voice is that of his secretary/typist, Anya, who is transcribing the book for the author, who she calls Senor C - her actual Diary. The book that the author is writing makes him come across as overly intelligent, smug, and rather douchebaggish. Anya is super attractive and comes across as perhaps not the brightest lightbulb in the box . As the book goes on, you can see in all three story lines how all the characters change, become more open, more intelligent, etc. It was a pretty interesting way to show how deeply someone can be affected by only one different person in their life, for maybe only a year. Moments from Anya's Diary, where she talks of telling Senor C something, can show up in an attitude or a line from the book that Senor is writing. Whereas Senor's attitude towards Anya tends to change her so that she becomes more positive about herself. ...more Ini kali pertama juga saya baca Coetzee dan saya menyenangi karya lewat pemenang nobel ini.

Malahan kita boleh memahami dengan mudah keintiman yang dikongsi oleh kedua-dua watak ini. Betapa cantiknya Coetzee menyusun semua ini dengan kata-kata yang minimal dan bersifat peribadi. ...more No s\u00e9 si este ha sido el mejor libro para adentrarse en el universo y la mente de Coetzee, ya que ha sido la primera obra que me he atrevido a leer. Y s\u00ed, digo bien, atrever. Hay determinados autores que son tan buenos, que tienen una fama tan reconocida y tan cimentada, que da miedo leerlos. Miedo a no comprender lo que lees, a darte cuenta que eres una tonta que no comprende a los grandes autores, y luego encima decir que no te ha gustado y que todo el mundo te la pide. Se me ha hecho muy pesada. Es una novela, o eso se supone, pero cuando lo m\u00e1s interesante son los ensayos, es que algo falla, en mi opini\u00f3n. Deber\u00eda haber una especie de equilibrio entre ambas partes. No s\u00e9, a ratos le\u00eda por el mero hecho de acabarla, con cierto hast\u00edo. No he le\u00eddo nada m\u00e1s de Coetzee, pero creo que si le interesa el ensayo de este tipo (breves, ya que son muchos pero no muy extensos) podr\u00eda haberse dedicado a ello de otra forma, y no establecer este h\u00edbrido extra\u00f1o. A most unusual book. Its text is divided into two and later three separate but interrelated narratives on each page. The premise is that an elderly author is writing a book of Strong Opinions and approaches a young Filipina, entirely on the basis of her 'perfect derriere', to assist him with typing. His 'opinions' make up the first of the novel\u2019s narratives and appear at the top of each page. Later these change to Soft Opinions, which he writes in response to her finding the first set boring. Cl A most unusual book.

His 'opinions' make up the first of the novel\u2019s narratives and appear at the top of each page.

Beneath this are his own accounts of his interactions with Anya, the Filipina secretary. The third section on each page is made up of Anya's thoughts and encompass the struggle with her 'investment consultant' boyfriend to separate the protagonist from his money via a cunning scheme. It is unlike any other book I have read and combines the opinions of Coetzee within a novel, merging himself and his character so we do not know where the line exists between fiction and non-fiction. It was not the greatest or most enjoyable read I have ever had but gets five stars for its ingenuity. ...more I'd give this 3.5 stars if I could - it's a formally interesting 'novel' which requires you to make choices in how you want to read it and thus, implicates you in the story-telling process. I'm still unsure how I really feel about it, as despite the clear presence of Coetzee's beautiful, dry prose, the 'plot' is quite unoriginal and some of the \"strong opinions\" irked me (others, on the other hand, were very thought-provoking). \u201e\u0414\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u043b\u043e\u0448\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u201d

<---A>J.M. Coetzee</---A> was born in South Africa and migrated to Australia in 2002. One of the blurb reviews on this copy is from The Age, and refers to Coetzee as a master \u201cwe scarcely deserve.\u201d I have no doubt that \u201cwe\u201d refers to \u201cwe Australians.\u201d I\u2019m also seeing him speak at the Wheeler Centre next Monday, and their description of the event takes care to mention in the opening paragraph that \u201cwe\u2019re lucky to have him living right here in Australia\u201d (exclamation mark implied). I suppose the cultural cring J.M. Coetzee was born in South Africa and migrated to Australia in 2002. One of the blurb reviews on this copy is from The Age, and refers to Coetzee as a master \u201cwe scarcely deserve.\u201d I have no doubt that \u201cwe\u201d refers to \u201cwe Australians.\u201d I\u2019m also seeing him speak at the Wheeler Centre next Monday, and their description of the event takes care to mention in the opening paragraph that \u201cwe\u2019re lucky to have him living right here in Australia\u201d (exclamation mark implied). I suppose the cultural cringe is alive and well, and I suppose I also suffer from it, because I agree \u2013 we are lucky, and we do scarcely deserve him. It feels odd to read one of the greatest living writers crisply discussing subjects close to home, such as Australia\u2019s bafflingly cruel treatment of refugees or the Liberal Party\u2019s general philosophy, but it\u2019s very satisfying. Diary of a Bad Year is part non-fiction, part fiction, and like many of Coetzee\u2019s works, part memoir. (There is, incidentally, no way he\u2019s never slept with one of his students.) The narrator, referred to as \u201cSenor C,\u201d is a South African emigrant to Australia, an acclaimed novelist and academic, who once wrote a book called Waiting for the Barbarians, but who is also much older than the real Coetzee, and who doesn\u2019t appear to have won the Nobel Prize. Senor C has been commissioned by a German publisher to contribute a series of \u201cstrong opinions\u201d on various social and political topics, and these short essays make up the first part of the book. If these essays were all that Diary of a Bad Year contained it would be a failure, because they are stiff and authoritarian and lecturing. (They were mostly in line with my own views, but that doesn\u2019t matter.) But the essays are cut off halfway down the page, replaced with a string of text detailing this fictional Coetzee\u2019s life, and how he employs Anya, his sexy young Filipina neighbour, to type for him. Essays on the outrage of Guantanamo Bay and the poor state of universities and anti-democratic secrecy laws are thus complemented by the lecherous narrative of an old man who, while being intelligent and measured and thoughtful, is nonetheless driven by his dick. And soon a third ribbon of text joins the story \u2013 the thoughts and opinions of Anya, who is smarter than she first appears. Coetzee uses the viewpoints of his fictionalised self, and of Anya, and even of Anya\u2019s boyfriend Alan (who is not given a thread, but has many lines of loudmouth dialogue in her section) to criticise and cast doubt on the strong opinions of the book\u2019s essays. This is a relief, because without them they would possess an insufferable surety, and proper novelist should never really be sure of anything. The essays often correspond subtly to the theme du jour of the lower stories; at least half the time they correspond so subtly that I couldn\u2019t finger the connections, though I have no doubt they were there; Coetzee is smarter than me, after all. The story at the bottom adds up to a reasonable novelette, and while it lacks the power and potency of a longer work, it was certainly worthwhile. This isn\u2019t one of Coetzee\u2019s stronger works \u2013 it certainly doesn\u2019t compare to Disgrace \u2013 but you wouldn\u2019t really expect it to. It\u2019s a neat little post-modern experiment (containing, ironically, a strong criticism of post-modernism) which is quick and concise. It\u2019s not the first book of Coetzee\u2019s you\u2019d want to read, but it is worth reading ...more I believe I previously in these pages called Nobel winner J.M. Coetzee the finest craftsman writing in English today, and Diary of a Bad Year forces me to agree with myself. The book\u2019s structure--and I\u2019m talking physical as well as literary structure here--gives credibility enough in itself. Three parallel voices appear on each page. On the top, the reader finds objective essays on matters political, philosophical, psychological ranging from Guantanamo Bay to music to motherhood. These are by a I believe I previously in these pages called Nobel winner J.M. Coetzee the finest craftsman writing in English today, and Diary of a Bad Year forces me to agree with myself.

On the top, the reader finds objective essays on matters political, philosophical, psychological ranging from Guantanamo Bay to music to motherhood. These are by and large pieces being composed as the novel proceeds, by the book\u2019s narrator, a prestigious author in his eighties, for a German publisher who is putting together a gathering of opinions from literary notables for a non-fiction anthology. In the center of each page, we find the voice of the narrator himself. On the bottom, that of the fetching young Filipina, Anya, who lives in the same apartment building as our writer. \u201cJuan,\u201d or \u201cse\u00f1or,\u201d or \u201csenior,\u201d or \u201cC,\u201d as he is variously called, is beginning to suffer the effects of some sort of degenerative nerve disease which makes it difficult to manage either keyboard or pen, so he needs a someone to type his dictated words into an English manuscript which will eventually be translated into German and published along with those of his eminent colleagues. He hires Anya, with whom he is infatuated anyhow, and who is not above feeding his infatuation with a flirtatious mixture of genuine affection and blatant teasing. Their budding relationship stokes the jealous fires of her live-in stockbroker boyfriend, whose animosity leads him to plot some serious embezzlement from a man who could never be a true rival, but whose competition, however imaginary, he nevertheless finds unbearable. Out of this rather slight plot Coetzee creates a work of great depth and complexity. The interplay between the narrative and the ideas explored in the essays is endlessly intricate and elusive, like light shimmering on taffeta. In addition, Coetzee\u2019s narrator is some incarnation of himself. He (born, 1940) is a good distance away from the mid-eighties of \u201cJuan,\u201d but he attributes the authorship of his own Waiting for the Barbarians to his fictitious altar-ego, and his description of another \u201cacquaintance\u201d sounds suspiciously close to another of his creations, Elizabeth Costello. So which part of \u201cJuan\u201d is Coetzee? Is the real life author suffering from Parkinson\u2019s? Is he taking the incredibly courageous step of imagining and writing about his own descent into infirmity? He\u2019s not saying, but the wondering adds a dimension to Diary that I recall in no other novel. And, of course, Coetzee, is so much the academic and intellectual, that keeping up with the content--ideas and references--in Juan\u2019s essays presents a challenge in itself. (Not to the extent that Elizabeth Costello did. That one nearly did me in, and I confess I gave up trying to understand it.) So, within this cerebral framework is the wonderfully complex bundle of contradictions--sexy, brainy, practical--that is Anya, her covetous lover, and the lovestruck writer. And Coetzee manages to pack more in this 225 pages than most authors manage in a thousand. I hope to hell Coetzee\u2019s not sliding into Parkinson paralysis, both for his own sake and for mine. I\u2019m banking on another good twenty or twenty five years, and I\u2019d love to have him in my future. ...more I was wondering if this was a one star book or a two star book. Decided on two, as you can see, but in reality I'd say it is more like 1.5 stars. I've read a few of Coetzee's books before, too. And I've liked them. So I bought this on sale, and now, after reading it, I understand why it was on sale in the first place. Maybe about half of it is about an old man writing about an old man writing about politics and humanity and the world in general. And maybe because I'm too young or whatever, I jus I was wondering if this was a one star book or a two star book. Decided on two, as you can see, but in reality I'd say it is more like 1.5 stars.

Maybe about half of it is about an old man writing about an old man writing about politics and humanity and the world in general. And maybe because I'm too young or whatever, I just didn't agree with him all that much. I disagreed and felt like he was flaunting his vocabulary, actually. It made him feel like a pretentious asshole. BUT. There are three stories here in one. Or actually just two, but told in three parts. There is the actual commentary on life, universe and everything, and there is the more interesting part, which is less opinions and more human interaction. And I sort of liked those parts. BUT 2. The female character in this book was so goddamn horrible that I want to travel to Australia and slap Mr Coetzee hard. (Had to google if he is dead yet. He isn't. Good. The book wasn't bad enough for me to want to slap dead people.) She might not be dumb, but she is still the kind of a woman that an old man would write after reading too much Cosmo and figuring \"this is how the 30 year olds work nowadays!\" Well, let me tell you, you are wrong. And if you aren't, I bloody well wish you were, because she is not a good character. Not at all. She has her good moments, sure, but they get drowned by all the \"SERIOUSLY?!\" moments. So, in general... there were parts I enjoyed, but not nearly enough of them. My inner, apparantely rapidly growing, feminist HATED the way the only female character was portrayed most of the time. I disliked all the other characters, too, but for different reasons. They were just not very likeable, and that is not always a fault. I didn't enjoy the opinionated pieces that much, especially since I read them before bed time and all those fancy words just before sleeping were very tiring. I did understand the point, I just personally am of the opinion that if you can't say something without showing off how you memorized your dictionary, you are probably not very good at saying much of anything. But that might just be me. Coetzee, I am disappoint. I think I'll keep to his older stuff in the future. The ones he has written before he got old and grumpy. The one he wrote when still more in touch with life in general. Maybe the ones he wrote before moving to Australia, I guess. ...more stopped reading it, there's just no time to waste on bad This work of \u201cfiction\u201d from the great J.M.

The pages of Diary of a Bad Year are divided into thirds. The top of each page starts with one of the opinions/essays, where Se\u00f1or C, who serves as Coetzee\u2019s mouthpiece, spins out circuitous philosophies about government and vitriolic criticisms against Bush, Cheney, and Blair. The second section of each page supposedly narrates the story of C\u2019s infatuation with a gorgeous young woman, Anya, whom he hires to type his essays. The third part of each page recounts Anya\u2019s interactions with the ailing C and her rocky relationship with her boyfriend, Alan, who wants to extort money from the old man. Both the second and third parts are glaringly undeveloped and mostly uninteresting, and the section of \u201copinions\u201d do not deliver any great depth. This is a disappointing work from one of the world\u2019s most revered literary craftsmen. From the mind who gave readers such engrossing works as Life and Times of Michael K , The Age of Iron , The Master of Petersburg , and Disgrace , Coetzee\u2019s lackluster Diary of a Bad Year does not seem to belong in his oeuvre. Coetzee admirers can only hope he finds the need to create a more imaginative work of fiction, worthy of the literary stature that deservedly earned him the Nobel Prize in 2003. ...more \u00abTodos formamos parte del continente, le dije.

Es decir, como un moderno blog de Internet como \u00e9ste. No es la primera vez que los personajes de Coetzee acaban siendo algo muy distinto a lo que se nos muestra al inicio del libro. No es que se transformen, claro, es s\u00f3lo que al avanzar la historia ellos se relacionan, se conocen, se afectan y a veces cambian, pero nunca demasiado. El autor sencillamente nos va mostrando (en este caso particular en ese estricto orden) las superficies, el intersticio y el fondo del coraz\u00f3n y de lo que hay en sus cabezas. El reflexivo, solitario y concienzudo novelista, fascinado por un \u00abculo hermoso\u00bb, acaba cuestionando sus contundentes opiniones por los inesperados pensamientos que de aquel culo hermoso, o de la cabeza que lo mov\u00eda, emanaron. Aunque claro, en eso tuvo que ver mucho, sino todo, el que fuera ya no m\u00e1s que un solitario viejo reducido a no mucho m\u00e1s que pensar, y que aquel culo fuera, efectivamente, tan hermoso. Sus opiniones contundentes, tal y como \u00e9l nos lo explica, son profundas, peculiares, a su edad pr\u00e1cticamente inmovibles. \u00c9l, desde luego, es sincero, y adem\u00e1s necesita decir lo que est\u00e1 diciendo; es l\u00facido, convincente, mas no por ello sus opiniones, dichas en alta voz y expuestas ante la cr\u00edtica, dejan de sonar pretensiosas, doctrinales y hasta un poco rid\u00edculas, como en resumidas cuentas lo es casi todo ensayo literario. Despu\u00e9s de todo, \u00bfrealmente qui\u00e9n es \u00e9l (\u00bfqui\u00e9n soy yo?) para afirmar tales cosas, y por qu\u00e9 es que lo que \u00e9l tiene necesidad de decir ha de importarle a alguien (quien, o tendr\u00e1 sus propias opiniones al respecto, o no le interesa tener alguna de todos modos)? En este aspecto la vanidosa Anya tiene toda la raz\u00f3n. Sin embargo, ese punto de vista pr\u00e1ctico y general de considerar las cosas tiene muy poco que ver con el arte, incluido el arte de la escritura. A ultimadas cuentas, aparte del vano deseo de que alguien te lea, existe en verdad una necesidad esencial, la de expresar lo que se est\u00e1 pensando o sintiendo para no explotar, para afirmar o reafirmar lo que uno es o siente ser. Y porque adem\u00e1s, aun a sabiendas de que lo que tengas que decir a muy pocos o a ninguno le importe, hay cosas que es necesario decir/escribir. El formato, la forma en que la novela est\u00e1 escrita es inusual, un interesante experimento que seguramente no se repetir\u00e1, pero que acaba sirviendo muy bien para la exposici\u00f3n particular de esta obra, es decir, sobre lo absurdas o irrelevantes que pueden acabar siendo nuestras m\u00e1s profundas convicciones, y lo necesarias que son para reafirmar nuestra individualidad. As\u00ed, Anya no es s\u00f3lo la arist\u00f3crata decimon\u00f3nica de buenos sentimientos, un coraz\u00f3n con patas dostoyevskiano, sino un individuo con convicciones propias, si bien no se ha tomado mucha molestia en pulirlas. Dudo mucho que el autor haya querido hacernos ver que Anya, en el fondo, no es una cabeza hueca, porque de hecho lo es (y ella misma lo sabe), sino que, aun con su juicio corto de miras y prejuicioso, tal chica resulta un complemento vital para el escritor y su pareja Alan. En otras palabras, es como la yegua de Animal Farm, la vida sin ella, sobre todo para un intelectual puro como el viejo escritor, no es ya la misma, pierde mucho de su brillo. Alan, en cambio, es el mismo Luzhin redivivo. Orgulloso de su autoformaci\u00f3n, c\u00ednico y completamente amoral, es en todo contrario al reflexivo y melanc\u00f3lico protagonista. \u00c9l tambi\u00e9n tiene sus opiniones contundentes propias, se jacta de ellas y adem\u00e1s demuestra su superioridad al llevarlas a la pr\u00e1ctica. Pero la gran diferencia, claro, es que la suya es una inteligencia al servicio exclusivo de s\u00ed misma. Ego\u00edsta y rapaz, nos muestra lo lamentables y ruines que pueden llegar a ser las ideas categ\u00f3ricas, y tambi\u00e9n por qu\u00e9, entonces, es imperioso por lo menos quejarse de esta individualidad inmoral y homicida. El barb\u00e1rico mundo en lucha constante que \u00e9l nos presenta como la inamovible y cruda realidad, es s\u00f3lo un mundo que \u00e9l y sus correligionarios crearon y se obstinan en mantener, pero que no tiene por qu\u00e9 ser as\u00ed. Debo decir que me cost\u00f3 trabajo entender las \u00faltimas dos novelas de Coetzee, Elizabeth Costello y el Hombre Lento , y la primera en particular, me dej\u00f3 algo confusa, medio llena, como si alguien me hubiese arrebatado de repente una deliciosa hamburguesa que deseaba comer hasta la \u00faltima migaja. M\u00e1s de una vez pens\u00e9 muy honestamente que a lo mejor no era yo muy avispada y que era mi culpa haber perdido \u00abel punto\u00bb esencial de la historia, pero ahora no s\u00e9. La met\u00e1fora del Hombre Lento , me parece, es la de mostrarnos c\u00f3mo durante el proceso de la escritura, m\u00e1s que el propio escritor, son los mismos personajes los que acaban tomando las riendas de la historia; sin embargo, hubo algo que no acab\u00f3 de convencerme en la forma de presentar la tal met\u00e1fora; y adem\u00e1s, ese final de corte disneyesco me pareci\u00f3 del todo precipitado. De Elizabeth Costello no sabr\u00eda ni qu\u00e9 decir, es la cosa m\u00e1s rara que haya le\u00eddo de este autor, y tras calentarme un poco el seso, decid\u00ed sencillamente dejar el asunto por zanjado; no acab\u00e9 de entender de qu\u00e9 trat\u00f3 la novela. \u00c9sta otra, por otro lado, vuelve a tener el sabor un tanto amargo, melanc\u00f3lico/pesimista, con dos gotas de esperanza de sus primeras novelas y me gust\u00f3 de veras. Dista mucho de ser el relato crudo y profundamente estremecedor de Esperando a los b\u00e1rbaros , Desgracia o La edad de hierro (gracias a los cuales qued\u00e9 prendada de este escritor), pero no deja de ser una historia \u00edntima, sincera, mordaz, y como todas sus otras novelas, constituye asimismo una (otra) valiosa lecci\u00f3n de escritura. No obstante, tambi\u00e9n deber\u00e9 anotar que el viejo decepcionado de la vida que se enamora de una hermosa joven va volvi\u00e9ndose ya m\u00e1s que mon\u00f3tono, est\u00e1 por convertirse en una aburrida y predecible regla. Y eso, como muy bien sabr\u00e1 J. M. Coetzee, nunca es bueno para el arte de las letras. ...more This book flowed through 3 different slants. 1st slant: The main protagnist's essays as an author delving into different topics on politics, religion, morality, the author life and so on.

I was definitely struck especially on the writings on politics. Probably because in these times, I too live in a \"state\" of confusion. 2nd slant: Main story and plot between Senor C (the aging author) and Anya (his hired Filipina typist). I cannot decipher if I appreciate the fact that their relationship remained in a way professional bordering on a being a little more affectionate. I don't how to feel that Anya is portrayed as not being that bright and say a bit superficial and too dependent on emotions. I can't say that I was okay with it but I didn't find it offensive but just a fact of character portrayal and shouldn't be thought of as anything more. 3rd slant: Anya's personal musings and opinions on Senor C's writings and her sentiments on their relationship. Didn't like Anya and Alan's relationship at all if you can even call it that exactly. I wonder if I took just 1 slant at a time, will the experience be made better, worse or the same?

The essays and opinions of \"Senor C\" are finally the most captivating and worthwhile aspect of Coetzee's novel (the comprehensiveness and, indeed, the prescience of the topics covered -- ranging from detention and torture to viruses and global pandemics to earthly identity and the afterlife to the virtues of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy -- suggest how dazzling and entertaining an essayist Coetzee is/could be), but the other two parts, which track the relationships of Senor C, his typist Anya, and her boyfriend, Alan, were too insubstantial to add the necessary poignance to the proceedings, and in fact sometimes are read out of something close to mere obligation. ...more The form and style of this novel have already been described and explored in various reviews, so I won't venture there and make my thoughts redundant.

The blog is the sphere for musings, and blogs are so prevalent and ubiquitous as to render them uninteresting. What was also fascinating for me was that the central character's short essays (musings) were critiqued and ridiculed by a personage representing the dominant reigning liberal view of the world. The central character (Mr C) seemed to represent the author, and the author gave space for critique (presumably of some of his own views.) More than the substance of the critique itself, what stood out to me is the assertion that the contemporary neo-liberal program is antithetical to any meaningful way of life which is in collusion with freedom and autonomy, life outside of politics and coercion. The human situations within and without the essays make the novel into a complete work, not just a didactic opportunity. ...more I was first introduced to Coetzee via his novel Disgrace.

There were passages, especially toward the end, where i thought i was reading late Paton. Was that deliberate, an homage of sorts, i wonder? I was reminded of Coppola's film, Lost in Translation, wherein Bill Murray's character finds himself as a lonely outsider in a foreign place, taking comfort in the fantasy of love with a much younger woman. This book draws many parallels, but is not, by any means, the same. The triumverate voices that narrate this story is unique and plays on the triplicity of the christian religion's holy trinity, as redemption is found. The style was at first distracting, but once i was sucked in, it made genius sense. ...more JMC continues his recent trend of writing novels that tease the reader that they are autobiography.

He seems committed to exploring the narrator/author identity issue; and while this has proven fertile terrain in other hands, it doesn't seem so in his. Putting that aside, this does feature an effective use of non-linear narrative -- there are 2 or 3 different narrative threads running on each page, one of which is the book the protagonist is writing (and later the private book he will never publish), the other two are his and/or his amanuensis's narrative. This device is deftly executed, and it was exciting for me to see this Derridean (as I think of it) technique carried out in a readable and effective form. All that said, the topoi of the book are too diffuse and scattered to really take root. Lots of little snippets of interest here and there, adding up to less than the sum of the parts. But, yes, some nice parts. Umph. ...more An interesting enough experiment, albeit very tricky to read.

Sounds straightforward? As an experiment, it is largely successful in the way that it explores the relationship that develops between the two characters, ultimately leading to evolutions in both their worldviews. That said, it can be a bugger to read, with lots of flipping back and forth between pages to try and piece together the narrative arc. ...more I found this book extremely annoying for the first twenty pages or so.
