However, what this story is\u2026.is beautifully written, richly characterized and brilliantly executed. Put simply\u2026it\u2019s wheel barrow full of WONDERFUL . My feelings for this book surprised me after my intensely passionate, torrid love affair with The Child Thief . I sort of felt bad for this book as I really thought it had no shot of being anything more than a diversionary \u201cget my head back together\u201d rebound novel. I certainly didn\u2019t imagine it had any chance of sweeping me up off my feet and carrying me way into its narrative. \u2026but it did. The story made me love it despite myself. PLOT SUMMARY : Set in England at the outbreak of WWII, young <---C>David</---C> loves books and stories. We meet David as he is watches his mother slowly die from illness. When she finally succumbs to death, David is devastated ( I told you book this wasn\u2019t a bright box of sunshine ). Eventually, David\u2019s dad gets remarried to a woman named Rose and the three of them move to Rose\u2019s country home where David\u2019s half brother, Georgie, is soon born. David is given the room of Rose\u2019s uncle, Jonathan Tulvey, who shared David\u2019s love of books and stories. Jonathan vanished as a young boy and has never been seen since. The books in Jonathan\u2019s room are old and full of ancient stories and many contain odd notes written by Jonathan. While Rose is nice and tries to form a bond with David, he finds himself increasingly angry at her and his new half-brother. He spends more and more time among the old books which begin to whisper to him and David starts to witness strange occurrences, including the appearance of a \u201ccrooked man\u201d watching him. Eventually David finds himself in another world where dark, grim versions of classic fairy tale characters exist but are nothing like the way they are normally portrayed. The depictions of these characters are outstanding and it often takes a while to identify who they are because they are so stripped of the normal fluffy accoutrements. While, most of the tone is serious and even bleak, there are some great moments of comedy. For example, in one of my favorite scenes, David encounters the Seven Dwarfs who turn out to be communist revolutionaries and political activists straight out of Monty Python\u2019s Holy Grail: Their relationship with Snow White is anything but pleasant. However, it is very, very funny. David soon discovers that he must make it to the King of this new world who might have the power to send him back home. However, David\u2019s journey is dark and perilous and he is constantly hunted by the \u201ccrooked man\u201d who has his own need of David. THOUGHTS : The beginning of the story takes its time to develop, but this leisurely pace didn\u2019t bother because Connolly does an amazing job with it. He keeps us engaged as he introduces us to the characters and slowly allows the fantasy elements to creep and and crawl and bleed into the narrative. This makes the transition from our world into the fantasy world feel authentic and seamless. In addition, the early events of the story turn out to be critical to the central plot and final resolution of the story and so form important threads in the overall tapestry. As alluded to above, I was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed this novel given how emotionally spent I was after reading The Child Thief . It's a credit to how marvelous a job Connolly did with this work that he was able to hold me enthralled to the narrative throughout. The characters are well drawn, with details and shadings to their personalities that make them come alive. I bonded with David very early on making the dangers that he faced all the more gripping. Finally, the plot itself was compelling and page-turningly addictive and Connolly\u2019s prose and descriptive talents were both excellent. Overall, a sensational book that over came great odds to pleasantly surprise me. If you get the chance to pick this book up...take it. 4.5 stars. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! ...more This is kind of a deceptive book. It seems like it could be young adult in tone at first but it is NOT young adult. It's an adult urban fantasy starring a child. Very cool and immersive, and a bit dark. Hell, a LOT dark sometimes, haha. The lore is very cool, you can tell that the author really loves folklore and all the elements of the world are interesting and believable. Worth checking out if you like magical realism and a lot of bite to your fairy tales. Part fairy tale and part psychological study, I found this to be an engrossing and powerful book. Recommend to everybody, particularly those who have used reading and books to get themselves through difficult times, especially in childhood. I don't look at this book the way some readers apparently have: as sci-fi or fantasy, but instead see it as showing the redemptive power of books and stories in children's and adults' lives. And as an account of one boy's inner life and imagination. I'm not sur Part fairy tale and part psychological study, I found this to be an engrossing and powerful book.

Dionysian imitatio , a literary method of imitation conceived as the practice of emulating, adaptating, reworking and enriching a source text by an earlier author. Book of Lost Things is a book of mythopoeic templates - revisited, revised, regurgitated, remixed, and reimagined. we have an entire company of Big Bad Wolves, reconfigured as ambitious wolf-men, born of a grotesquely slutty Little Red Hood and sprung from the nightmares of a juvenile king... a perhaps not-so-Wicked Stepmother... a malevolent and terrifying Sleeping Beauty... Childe Roland, transformed as a brave gay soldier in search of his long-lost lover... trolls and harpies and a savage, hungry Beast... a young girl's spirit in a glass jar... and our villain, a gleeful child-thief, a striker of dark bargains, a Rumpelstiltskin, an old old devil: The Crooked Man. the use of revisionism is, sadly, not always successful. a comic interlude with the socialist Seven Dwarves and an obese, monstrous Snow White is depressingly unfunny and a little desperate (at least to this reader). and a long part near the end, depicting various torture chambers and examples of The Crooked Man's terrible villainy seems to be merely an excuse for Connolly to indulge himself with a gloatingly vicious array of sadistic tableau. both sequences were eye-rolling and sigh-inducing. but those are aberrations; despite them, Connolly more than succeeds in creating delightful and intriguing reinterprations of figures from fairy and folk tale. even better, David's character is a slow-burning but dynamic one, changing in bits and starts from boy to man with each new encounter. he is a realistically flawed protagonist as well as a brave and endearing little hero. Memento mori , a Latin phrase translated as \"Remember your mortality\", \"Remember you must die\" or \"Remember you will die\"... it names a genre of artistic work which varies widely, but which all share the same purpose: to remind people of their own mortality. the novel's extended endings were a brilliant surprise. to avoid spoilers, i'll just say that i was entirely taken aback by the meaning of <+++>The Book of Lost Things</+++> itself. and - even more memorably, more intensely - the closing pages' no-nonsense illustration of the potential and/or inherent tragedy of human life in general... and the idea of that tragedy - no matter how intimate - somehow not really being that tragic at all - just simply a part of the greater cycle of life, death, and rebirth. i hate to end a review with a tv show reference... but if you have ever seen the last 10 minutes or so of Six Feet Under's final episode - a wondrously sad, wistful, yet somehow uplifting experience - you will know exactly what i mean. the ending of this rather fantastic book is equally moving. ...more I stayed up till 1 last night to finish this book.

If you need to get nasty and personal with your remarks, I'll probably be reporting and blocking you as well. Connolly's \"Book of Lost Things\" came highly recommended as a modern take on the fantasy genre. What I found instead was a completely unlikeable main character, an array of interchangeable father figures, and a disappointing rehash of the usual fairy tale parodies. \"Lost Things\" centers on David, a boy whose mother dies and whose father remarries and has a second child, leaving David to bicker bitterly with his new stepmother while trying to avoid anxiety attacks that leave him blacked out and feverish. And that groundwork occurs in one of the most poorly paced info-dumps I've had the misfortune to read. The first chapter focuses on David and his mother, leading you to believe this will be the crux of the story - but alas, she dies. The second chapter focuses on the father's remarriage and David's anxiety attacks leading the reader to believe, perhaps, this is the focus of the story - it is not. The third and fourth chapters center on David's mostly absent father whose work is \"top secret\" and David's fights with his step-mother and we, the audience, raise our index fingers and say, \"Ah-ha! Top secret Dad! Conflict with the new parental figure! This, surely, is the story!\" But, alas, those are red-herrings as well. In fact, after the sixth chapter, neither of those characters appears again until the (two chapters long!) epilogue. The real story ends up being David's abduction into the land of fairy tales by the Crooked Man, a Rumpelstiltskin who makes vicious bargains with emotional children to feed his magical slave house. David starts off his true adventure by following the voice of his dead mother - but don't assume that the story somehow involves David's mother's spirit wandering painfully in the fantasy realm awaiting rescue, this too, in Connolly fashion, is completely irrelevant to the story. Instead, David wanders the fantasy realm accompanied by a series of nearly identical substitute fathers who end up betraying David's trust in one way or another - by being gay in one case (Roland), by being fallible in another (the generic Woodsman). In the end, David finds another potential father figure in Jonathon, and quickly realizes that not only is Jonathon a liar and a murderer, but also that he, David, no longer needs a father figure because he's now become a man of his own right. He then stares down Jonathon, the Crooked Man, and the vicious wolf monsters, who until that point only appeared in the story when Connolly felt the need to remind us that David was in danger because wolf monsters were chasing him; they never catch up to him except at the end and, as I said, David simply stares them down and wins by virtue of his newfound manhood. In all, \"Lost Things\" is a plodding, thinly veiled paean to a baby-boomer-era view of \"manhood\" as stoic resolution and resistance to all hurts, including mental and emotional. Perhaps this story plays better, and I don't wish to be insulting, with a female audience, one that's never had to grapple with questions of \"manliness\" or had to decide on an appropriate level of attachment to an older male. As for me, I was insulted that David begins the story emotionally wounded by what he views as a betrayal by his father and, instead of finding closure, he learns to just get over it and \"be a man\" about it. But a bigger insult, in my eyes, was the closing of the book - Connolly is so in love with his work that he follows up the main story with almost 150 pages of notes and commentary on his story: everything from the origins of the fairy tales he parodies to his woeful recollections of scenes that were cut from the final draft ( murder your darlings, Connolly! ). It's as jarring as it would be had Stephen King ended Christine with detailed descriptions of a Plymouth Belvedere and ten pages of him crying about the Arnie/Christine tailpipe sex scene that his editors excised from the final publication. This was my first experience with Connolly, and as it's his most highly recommended book, I'll probably pass on his work in the future. ...more \u201cFor in every adult there dwells the child that was, and in every child there lies the adult that will be.\u201d John Connolly\u2019s <+++>The Book of Lost Things</+++> is a tale that reflects everyone\u2019s story of growing up.

Some would say that it\u2019s a story of losing one\u2019s innocence, but are we ever really innocent? Through time we have come to develop feelings of grief, rage, hatred, and jealousy. These are some of the things that eat the pure off of us. At some point, we have all become the things we feared the most. We have turned into our very own monsters, destroying the good that is ahead of us. This is the story of how David overcame his monsters. As a young boy, David lost his mother, and his only means of coping up with his grief was reading, an interest he got from her. The books started whispering to him and only he could hear them. Months after his beloved mother\u2019s death, his father remarried. Rose, his father\u2019s new love got pregnant with Georgie, David\u2019s new half-brother. As a part of starting a new life with his step-mother and half-brother, David and his father moved out of their London home and into Rose\u2019s which was located out of the city. There, in the old house, he was given a room that was used to be of a boy named Jonathan Tulvey. It was filled with old books that David tried to read for himself although some he could not understand thoroughly. In his dreams and around the house, David began seeing a figure of a man with distinct, odd features. Drawing closer and closer to him, waiting in the shadows, was the Crooked Man. I borrowed a copy of this from my cousin and it had been sitting on my shelf for months. At first, I was not too thrilled to start reading it due to the synopsis at the back of the book. It was not very attractive to me. I decided to read it just so I could return it to her sooner. I was so wrong to judge this book by the few words written on its back cover. I was not expecting it to fascinate me, to touch my heart, and to show me what it means to live and to be alive, but it did. It was an extraordinary experience that was beyond my anticipation for it. The synopsis didn\u2019t do it justice. It was a dark, strange, tragic, and bloody adventure that every child in us would fear, but the adult in us would come to understand the truth beneath its surface. In it are very familiar tales that were distorted to suit the book\u2019s eeriness, constructing a twisted realm parallel to David\u2019s reality. David was a child at the beginning of the story, and you could really visualize how his character developed. He became more mature as he learned to decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. In time, he also became more selfless, learning that love could cause a terrible ache, and living, sometimes, could hurt. His journey in the world beyond the sunken garden emblematized a lot of things that he was battling in his heart. They were struggles he had to face to help him cope with the pain of losing his mother and adjust to his new life. The world that the author wrote into being was quite disturbing. It was stripped off of peace, innocence, and hope. In every corner of it lurked danger that a child like David, realistically, might not be able to endure. I don\u2019t even think adults could come out alive of the situations David found himself in. There were beasts, creatures that could kill or mangle you. There was also a bit of sexual content implied in it that I was not expecting. It was not graphic, but it would be perturbing if a very young child would mistaken this as a children\u2019s book and read it. He could either be very curious to try those things out or be afraid of them. A hundred pages on the origin stories and source materials were included in the latter part of the book, explaining further how each distorted tale woven into The Book of Lost Things represented something significant in David\u2019s life. It gave me a clearer insight of what David was going through, reminding me more that, somehow, I have been there too. It was quite amusing to reread those fairytales and to read some of them for the first time. They felt familiar but at the same time strange because after all these years of not reading them and then revisiting them now, it seemed to me that they were telling a different story that exhibited deeper reason than how I perceived them when I was just a child. There were also explanations on how each of the characters represented an archetype or a persona that contributed greatly not only to the development of this story, but also to those that inspired it. This is a really cleverly-written adventure and I highly recommend it. I hope you guys would give it a try. Surely, I will be reading more books written by this author in the future. ...more \u201cFor in every adult there dwells the child that was, and in every child there lies the adult that will be.\u201d This turned out to be a lot darker and crueller than I expected it to be.

Don't let yourself be fooled, this is prime time fantasy. The writing captured me right away. It created a magical and fairytale atmosphere and pulled me right in. One thing is for sure, John Connolly can write. A few chapters in, when the main character left reality for the parallel fantasy world, I wasn't sure this magical atmosphere would hold. Suddenly too many things happened at once, the pace increased and new characters were introduced almost every page. Luckily, Connolly managed to keep the atmosphere from crumbling and built an incredible and dark tale, based on many familiar characters and stories from popular fairytales. Just keep in mind that this is anything but Disney. The author stripped the fairytales of most romanticising aspects and went back to the original and often cruel version of the tales. He gave them his own, sombre twist and developed an exciting and often surprising plot. (view spoiler) [I just have to talk about Roland here, for a minute.

After a time we get to know him a little better and find out that he is looking for someone, another knight, whose picture he keeps hidden in a locket around his neck. I could smell the gay from far away. His was such a beautiful and tragic story, and I really wanted to know more about him, he deserved a happy ending, but I knew, and he knew, that there was no such thing in his future. Which made my heart ache a little more. Enough rambling. (hide spoiler) ] There are many fairytales out there and many of them include lovely princesses with fancy dresses and beautiful hair. If you are ready to find out what Snow White is really like, or what unspeakable truth lead Red Riding Hood off the path and into the woods, you should make sure to read this book. P.S.: I'm hoping for Guillermo del Toro to discover this book and adapt it. Find more of my books on Instagram ...more A fairytale turned nightmare. I loved this! First off, let me tell you that this is not something for the faint of heart. Some passages were definitely scary or just plain twisted and gross (think bad witch cutting off children's heads and putting them on animals to then hunt them..). I want to get that out of the way because the word fairytale can be misleading. Those elements in the story were used sparingly though and never took over the story to the point were it turned into the horror genre A fairytale turned nightmare. I loved this! First off, let me tell you that this is not something for the faint of heart. Some passages were definitely scary or just plain twisted and gross (think bad witch cutting off children's heads and putting them on animals to then hunt them..). I want to get that out of the way because the word fairytale can be misleading. Those elements in the story were used sparingly though and never took over the story to the point were it turned into the horror genre. David, the main character, is a young boy who has just lost his mother. That event triggered something in him and he experiences seizures and is suddenly able to hear his books whisper and talk. The angrier he gets at his father for starting to live and marry again the more he experiences the real world and the world of stories blurring... until he becomes a part of one. He completely disappears into a world next to our own and has to find his way back. Of course, evil powers are trying to prevent him from doing so. It's a fairytale itself after all. The overall atmosphere is dark and scary. I was not expecting it to be for an older audience, but that is how it read for me. Looking at the cover I was expecting it to almost lean towards the middle grade genre. The twisted and scary parts of the story are not something I would recommend to someone of that age though. There are plenty of well-known fairytales mentioned that make it fun for someone who has been exposed to them over the years, but they have been turned into their nightmare version. The little red riding hood, for example, lays with a wolf she had followed through the woods and through their encounter an evil wold-human hybrid comes into existence. On the other hand, the chapter about Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs is plain hilarious. She is an arrogant, awful and high maintenance young woman and the dwarfs feel so oppressed that they have turned into communists. You have to read in order to really appreciate this crazy storyline haha I enjoyed a lot and highly recommend this to people who are in for a dark, twisted, and edgy version of a fairytale retelling. ...more Read this book without really knowing too much about it.

Loved it. loved it. loved it. ...more this was fine. i think i expected it to be a little more grown-up than it was. in many ways i am a huge infant, but not so much in my reading, unless its reeeally young reader picture books. but this had some nice reimaginings of traditional fairy tales, and it certainly doesnt take long to read, so i recommend to those adults that are already reading the harry potters and twilights. you babies! According to Alice Hoffman, every fairy tale had a bloody lining. Everyone had teeth and claws. This one got fangs. And razor-sharp claws. It will lure you in with promises of magical books and mysterious flowers. Then, when it has you firmly in it's grasp, it will suck you in deeper into the dark. And won't let you go until it has its way with you.

Then, when it has you firmly in it's grasp, it will suck you in deeper into the dark. And won't let you go until it has its way with you. In Book of Lost Things, John Conolly collected fragments of my beloved bed time stories,twisted them so crookedly,and made them ornaments to a dark,beautiful world of his own. A world of betrayal and charming witches. Of wars and different forms of love. Of friendship and sacrifices. Of death. Of second chances. Of trees that bleed and lost children never found again. Of stories that end in death. Of our worst nightmares given life. And of the crooked man that haunts the shadowy parts of our imagination, the one we know but not really. What's his name again? Rumple- Right. Don't say it now. You know he doesn't like it when you do. In a prose that is both rich and cunning, Conolly indulgently and unhurriedly tells the story of young, grudge-holding, selfish,and book-obsessed David who entered a crack in the wall of a sunken garden in hopes of gaining back everything that he's lost. He took his time, making sure to catch his readers unaware time and time again by dropping these little bombs one by one. Some stories do not get happy endings. Princes and Princesses aren't perfect. There's but a very thin line separating bravery from foolishness. Even kings don't know everything. Sometimes you could rely on others for help. But mostly there's only really you. The smallest of hearts could be incubating the greatest of evil. The smallest of hearts have endless,cavernous rooms. Most of these most of us already know of course. But still we are a bit startled to encounter them here,in The Book of Lost Things and the little fairy stories in it. Because what are these facts doing here? In fantasy? Among tales that are supposed to tell us white knights shall be riding to our rescue, convince us little girls outwit big,hungry bears, and reassure us that all will come to a happy end. But just like the stories that I love best,this one gives you choices. A. David,a disturbed boy who got worse after his mother's death was lodged into a crack in the wall of a sunken garden after an explosion and had a really vivid,long dream- a dream that he returned to moments before his death. B. David entered the crack in the wall into Elsewhere,a world very different from ours but just as real. Or C. Elsewhere exists only in our imaginations but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not real. There. Take your pick. ...more Oh wow , what can I say? This book destroyed me, this book surpassed my expectations for it , I picked this up thinking it was going to be just a vapid book but boy this it's so much more that it's blurb would let you to believe. Think Grimm brothers, Disney , folk and fairy tales , ya modern literature (I'll compare it to a monster calls) and you will get a glimpse at the work that went behind this book. Then ending would make you feel all the feelings .....

It seems like a children's fairy tale, but if I had read this as a young'un, I would probably be in an insane asylum to this day. I know Connolly typically writes crime fiction and this being my first, I'm unable to compare it to his other work. But from this reading, I know that Connolly is a man of deep thoughtfulness and emotion, and one who can perfectly transfer that emotion and philosophy to the written page. The way the beginning is written, in which the main character, David, is dealing with his mother's slow death, I have no doubt that Connolly is writing from his own experiences. The minute details he chooses to include are just spot on. One thing to know before going in, this book will twist your head in knots. I've read a lot of horror fiction through the years, but many scenes in this book, partly because of their juxtaposition of childlike fairy tales and real-world, grown-up horrors, make this, on the whole, easily the most horrific collection of scenes I've read in my life. And I see no other novel containing scenes that come close to their power. For that reason, it did take me a little longer to get through this novel. I would read a few chapters and become so overwhelmed by what was going on, I needed a break: sometimes hours, sometimes a day. There is a LOT of weight to this book, even with its deceptively simple prose and presentation. I can easily say this is a book I will never forget. It will haunt me.

Connolly may have been trying for \"once-upon-a-time\" fairy-tale remove, but only undercuts what could've been a really heartbreaking and harrowing journey. The twisted fairy tale elements of the book are indeed pretty clever -- the seven dwarfs as Marxist proletarians, hee -- but did we need the massive and pretentious index at the end? Sure, I was interested to (re-)read the source material, but the prefatory paragraphs, overexplaining how the material is incorporated into the narrative, are insufferable -- worse than those headsets you can clap on at art museums.

I mention the darker aspects of the book simply to alert the potential reader that this is not a modern day Cinderella story that many expect when they hear \u201cfairytale.\u201d This book is the wonder of fairy tales combined with the darker side of human nature. The setting of the book is England during WWII. David, the protagonist of the book, is a 12 year old boy who loses his mother to illness at the outset of the book. We witness David\u2019s life turned upside down by the death of his mother and subsequent remarriage of his father. While David attempts to adapt he is seemingly incapable of doing so and takes refuge in his books. David begins to hear the books talking and also starts to experience fainting spells. A series of events lures David out of our world and into a fairytale kingdom where the Crooked Man has his own plans for David\u2019s life. This book artfully explores the harsh transition from childhood to adulthood. In the fairytale kingdom, David finds all the characters and stories from his beloved books but they have been changed. If you\u2019ve ever read a book or watched a movie and then gone to sleep, and your subconscious incorporates the story into your dreams with surreal twists \u2013 David\u2019s fairytale kingdom is those dreams and nightmares come to life. It is extraordinarily creepy and wonderful at the same time. David\u2019s mother taught him that stories want to be told. As noted in one review \u201cmore than anything, Connolly's novel is an ode to the power of story.\u201d (bookreporter.com) - \"Stories...came alive in the telling... They were like seeds in the beak of a bird, waiting to fall to earth, or the notes of a song laid out on a sheet, yearning for an instrument to bring their music into being. They lay dormant, hoping for the chance to emerge. Once someone started to read them, they could begin to change. They could take root in the imagination, and transform the reader.\" The Book of Lost Things is the telling of David\u2019s story. We are the audience for his necessary but painful transition from boy to man. The book incorporates the tragic beauty associated with such an experience. Connolly does not hold back when exploring the loss of innocence experienced by all children at some point. Specifically, we hear of sinister acts of the Crooked Man who rips children from childhood by forcing adult knowledge on them long before they are ready. While it made me cringe to read some of these details, it is the reality of life. Connolly\u2019s fairy tales are infused with the ugliness of the real world that does indeed steal innocence, or more accurately blissful ignorance, from children. The book also touches on obsessive compulsive disorder as we see David\u2019s desperate attempt to control fate and avoid the death of his mother. Ultimately, The Book of Lost Things is very real; a visceral coming of age tale. David\u2019s experiences with loss, death and war are suffused into the fairytales. In order to become an adult, David must learn to balance imagination and belief with the tragic reality of everyday life. My only significant criticisms of this book are the treatment of female characters and the lack of lighter elements to balance the darker. It appears most of the evil or negativity exhibited in the fairytale kingdom is generated from female characters. However, I think this may be for two reasons (1) that is how many of the traditional fairy tales are written with the vices of women being the downfall of men etc. \u2013 a topic with extensive social and cultural influences that I won\u2019t go into here; and (2) David\u2019s issues with his step-mother, Rose. So while it seems to fit, I think it may have been overplayed but that is just my opinion. It certainly did not impact my appreciation of the book. Finally, I would have appreciated a bit more incorporated about faith and the potential goodness of mankind to balance out the darker tone of the book. I think we need to believe in the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel to endure the dark journey. While this was present in the book, I would have liked to have seen it receive more emphasis. ...more Hmmmm. What to say about this book... Okay, in many ways, brilliant. It started off reading like a children's story and I was immediately thinking that I'd lend it to my 8-year-old niece. But as the book progressed, it moved further and further into a clear adult-fantasy. And like many adult-fantasy authors these days, Connelly has taken old fables/fairy tales and put his own twist on them. Rather than revelling them into an entire story, like Gregory Maguire does, Connelly just keeps them as lit Hmmmm. What to say about this book... Okay, in many ways, brilliant.

And like many adult-fantasy authors these days, Connelly has taken old fables/fairy tales and put his own twist on them. Rather than revelling them into an entire story, like Gregory Maguire does, Connelly just keeps them as little back stories that only build up the bigger picture, which I enjoyed. The Crooked Man especially was reminiscent of Rumpelstilsken, except far crueller. And Connelly's writing style is great; insightful, whimsical but still simple. I definitely got into this book immediately. However, I started losing interest during several parts of the book. There were a few chapters that could have been omitted and I wouldn't have missed them at all. And while I understand the significance of a 12-year-old boy just trying to stay alive in a dangerous and violent world, the book was just a little too much for me at times. I felt nauseous or horrified more than a few times. I guess that could be the stroke of a good author, to ignite these feelings, but a book that should have taken me a night to read, took four. My heart broke during certain passages and I'm not sure I could be able to read this book again. But I'd recommend it to somebody who's a fan of darker fantasies...and I do mean dark. ...more So I finished the story part of this last night (though I'm still browsing through the additional material stuff), and I ended up really liking it.

Actually, I found the ending very poignant and bitter sweet... touching and sad and beautiful, and it elevated an otherwise 3.5 star book to a full 4 stars. I will say that I enjoyed the story pretty much throughout. I really like fairy tale re-tellings, and I like the way they were often put on their head in this story, but also used to both teach David lessons and also as a way of showing the reader the progression of David's growth. Like all fairy tales (at least the ones I know) - it had its gruesome parts and its horror, but also its underlying themes and moral lessons. In this book we watch David mature into a young man, learning to deal with the pain of loss and grief, and finding a way to appreciate life and what he has in the moment instead of trying to reclaim what he lost. He overcomes his fears and jealousies to become a man of honor and fortitude, and while his life was not without horror and tragedy - for what life is? - he manages to persevere and more. All that said, I kept hoping for a bit more substance or lyricism or something. After some thought I decided that the simplistic writing style fits the fairy tale motif and also the fact that it's from David's perspective (and the writing did seem to develop a bit, too, as the book progressed. Either that or I just got used to it.) But there were definite times where I felt it stayed a bit too on the surface of things and was hoping for more - which is why it was more of a 3.5 half for most of it. ***** As to the fairy tales themselves, I particularly liked the bit with Snow White and the dwarves, and also the parts with Roland. I couldn't help but think of and compare the stories to the originals - though, in Roland's case I thought more of the Dark Tower saga than of the poem, since I don't think I've actually read the whole poem. There were definitely some interesting parallels there, what with the world moving on and the quest for the tower and all, but I think those are bits from the poem. (I couldn't help but envision Roland in the same way I think of him from the Dark Tower, though.) (Speaking of envisioning people, I kept 'hearing' the Crooked Man's voice in my head as the Dark One/Mr. Gold/Rumplestiltskin from 'Once Upon a Time'.) One thing I was uncomfortable with was the sort of negative view of sexuality in the book - homo and heterosexual. I understand that a lot of this is both a reflection of the time period and also of David's immature understanding of such things, but it did make me a bit tetchy from time to time that sexuality was often portrayed in such a negative light. *** Some Spoilerage **** Anyway - I also really like the questions that the reader is left with. How much of what happened really happened? Did David actually wander into a magical realm, or did it happen in his head while he was in a coma? And how much does it even matter? I like to think it's a weird blending of both. After all, we are told that people from our world who travel into that other world bring things with them, so it's always been built, a little, on imagination. But I like to think it's real, in a way, too. Perhaps, in all the ways that matter, it's even more real than real... What popped into my head after it was over and I wondered to myself about such things was Dumbledore's line from towards the end of Deathly Hallows: \"Of course it's happening inside your head, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?\" ...more I loved it even more the second time around. RTC (hopefully) * * * * * A children's book not suitable for (most) children should be a tagline somewhere on the cover because it's necessary. That aside, I really like this book and John Connolly\u2019s writing. Fairy tale retelling is one of those things I stay away from because in general these stories are either not well conveyed or they don\u2019t bring anything new to a classic narrative or they rely too much on the existing tale and world to carry the book.

Also, I find many retellings boring and predictable, not because I already know how they end, but because the writers fail to bring in new or unique perspectives to keep the tales fresh and interesting. The Book of Lost Things is different in that regard, and I think it has a lot to do with Connolly being aware of and having control over the dark subject matter in which he chose to take on.

Since 2008, you've called my name and whispered promises of sweet, sweet booklove to me whenever I would walk by my bookshelves. And I know that you think I just ignored you, but I didn't. I always knew you were there, but I admit to being selfishly promiscuous and taking out other books before you. Many, many other books. You always waited, always understood, and I appreciate that. Although it's a little weird, and sad. But whatever, we are who we are, right? Finally I gave you your shot, and our first night together was... good. Not amazing, but not bad. And then the rest of our time together stayed right there, in \"good, but not great\" territory. This wasn't your fault. It's just that, well, having been around the bookcase as many times as I have, a girl might meet a book that just wows her, sweeps her off her feet, and then takes her on this whirlwind ride, leaving her breathless and aching for more and a little empty inside... and so, Bolt, while you're surely great in your own way... well, I felt like we just lacked that spark. I'm not going to name any titles - we don't need to go there - but I'll just say that other book was amazing, but left me wounded, and, I'm sorry, but you didn't quite fill that hole. I just have to be honest. I felt like you were a little emotionally detached, a little messy, a little scattered and unfocused. But worst of all, I felt a little hint of misogyny, and that definitely made things a little uncomfortable for me. I know you weren't trying to say that ALL women are bad, or evil or whatever, or that men are somehow better... but it just seemed like every time you'd start to tell me a little story, there was an evil chick in it. I just felt like you were trying to make a point or something. Yeah, the main \"bad guy\" was a guy, but proportionally, you have to admit that the women in your little stories weren't really painted with a loving brush. Just sayin'. And, I'm sorry to be harsh, but I think you should see someone about your mother issues. I mean, it seems like you loved her, but when she died it seems like you completely shut down and detached. She's the reason for your love of stories, and the reason you told them all to me, but I never really felt like there was a real bond between you. I wanted to know you mourned her death, but instead you just turned really selfish... like you felt like her death was about you, and that your main story was just an adventure to try to put your life back to what it was before her death, without regard for her at all. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but that's just how it seemed to me. Getting back to the subject of your stories, why were there so MANY? I liked them, sure, but after a while, they all started feeling the same to me, and I just wanted things to move along a bit and stop getting so sidetracked. This is what I mean about being scattered and unfocused. I felt like you had a story about every old fairy tale ever written, just changed and darkened a bit, which made them all feel similar to each other. I need excitement to keep things interesting. I have a wandering eye. You knew that when you met me. Basically, what this all boils down to is that I wanted more from you. I like you, and had a good time, but I don't think a second date is in our future. I'm sorry. I really wanted to love you, but it just wasn't in the pages for us. I really hope that you find a girl who can love you for you, Bolt. Good luck.

Connolly\u2019s story begins during World War II, where the main character, David, has moved to the childhood home of his new stepmother to escape the possibility of a German occupation in London. David\u2019s mother had passed away a few years earlier due to a terminal disease and he had never really found a way to cope with it, shouldering most of the blame and rejecting his father\u2019s new wife because of it. His inability to cope have resulted in David taking frequent panic attacks and passing out for extended periods of time. His parents begin to worry when David claims that the books in his bedroom have begun to talk to him, whispering to him from time to time. One evening, after an argument with his step mother, David wanders out to his backyard claiming he\u2019s hearing calls for help from his mother. He crawls through a space in the fence somehow transporting him into a world similar to his favorite fairy tales. Now, I know this sounds pretty childish but it really isn\u2019t. \u201cThe Book Of Lost Things\u201d can at times be extremely violent as Connolly seems to enjoy twisting and taking apart various fairy tales. Snow White, for example, never meets her prince. Instead, she over-eats and forces the seven dwarfs into slave labor for the rest of their lives to support her. This leaves the dwarfs constantly trying to find a way to kill her in order to be free. Connolly puts his own spin on several other classic tales coming away with something fresh and memorable. He develops a great antagonist with the book\u2019s main villain, \u201cThe Crooked Man\u201d. In the end, he is an extremely desperate and vengeful character who is fully realized and spiteful. In fact, his speech to David near the book\u2019s conclusion is something to watch for. Quite possibly one of my favorite literary villains to date. This was the first Connolly book I\u2019d read and after reading almost everything else he has to offer, it remains near the top of my favorites. I\u2019d recommend it to just about anyone. Cross posted on Every Read Thing ...more Awesome, dark beautiful book. I still insist on viewing Roland as a gay man and nothing will convince me otherwise. Besides, how cool is it to have a brave, non stereotypical gay character? It doesn't happen often. This book is very dark, so it's probably not good for younger audiences. It has strong messages about what it means to go from man to boy, about facing your grief and I can't believe that bellyfull of gold thing actually historically happened. Horrifying. This book is still good. Also, Awesome, dark beautiful book. I still insist on viewing Roland as a gay man and nothing will convince me otherwise.
