Lucky bastard, but like I said, it might drop down to 1star one day. The main problem would be the characters. Almost all of them were flat and dull. Dull to the point that you wouldn't mind them dying. To be honest Kelly and her daughter were the only ones well developed. That says a lot about this novel, she's not even the main character. Nate was terribly boring, despite his knowledge of the Amazon and all.<---F> No sympathy felt while reading this</---F>. Another huge problem would be the plot, or the substance of it. This novel had huge potential, but wow, it failed big time. The Amazon. That alone drawn me in to read this novel, and obviously I was expecting a lot. I was expecting to read more of the animals, insects, and other weird made up creatures, but instead I was shoved with plants, and a few mildly interesting creatures. Don't get me wrong, the plants mentioned in the novel were fairly interesting, but it wasn't adequate to make the novel as amazing as it should've been. Like I said, we're talking about the Amazon here, anything can happen. It being a huge mystery, James Rollins could've given us more than what he did. I can't further express how disappointed I am, because the list would go on and on if I am to talk about the inadequacy of the Amazon experience I was looking forward to. Next issue would be the \"secret\" of the Amazon. It was okay, but nothing to be amazed about. (<---B>view spoiler</---B>) [ Sure the fact that his father was still alive was a little bit shocking, but I wasn't that impressed. Even the cure itself was utterly boring for me. Need I repeat myself, James Rollins could've given us more. (hide spoiler) ] Before anyone comment on maybe I'm not fond of this genre, I will stop you right there and say that I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan, especially of this genre to be precise. Amazon, jungles, underwater, desert, etc. Those things interest me, especially the animals and weird horror filled things that could be unraveled. Mystery filled Sci-Fi adventure is an amazing genre for me, I've read some books, and also seen some movies regarding these, and I liked them. So to sum it all up, I really didn't like this novel. It had a huge potential to be one of my favorites, but it ended up being one of the novels I wouldn't recommend to anyone. I didn't like it, but I guess it was also okay in a way. Mildly interesting botany facts, and a few mildly interesting creatures. If I were you though, I'd read something else of James Rollins. I've read some of his other novels, and really liked them. I did have huge expectations before reading this, so maybe that contributed to this awful disappointment I'm feeling right now. 2 bloody awful stars. ...more Holy holes in the fence Batman!

All James Rollins stories, save two, that I can think of get the same opening statement...\"Fast Paced.\" This is no exception, however, in this one, I think the balance between speed of plot and details is handled better than in other Rollins Novels. There is a character that I'm sure becomes Joe Kowalski in later books that I just love, but he goes by a different name here (similar background). All action adventure stories need a Joe Kowolski type...he's great! I don't like the \"Treasure\" they find at the end of the story as much as in other James Rollins books, but I loved the adventure to it and back and I like the Hero and Heroine, also better than in other books (save Subterranean might have had a heroine whom I liked better). There is a lot of action, a lot of scientific mystery and mysterious amazing sub plots and twists and turns And, of course, monsters wiht HUGE SNAPPING TEETH! (cough)... I mean.. yes, quite frightening creatures that lurk in the depths of hte Amazaon basis. (cough) The villains were cool, not as interesting as Ice Hunt, but close enough. And at the end we see the begining of the Sigma Force Novels starting to get organized... a foreshadowing of serial fun to come (Starting with Sandstorm). But I digress. Summary-Good book, well paced for action adventure, some violence but generally what I'd call \"Made for TV Movie\" level violence, very managable. If not a great plot, great execution of plot (about the writing) ...and of course... HUGE...Big...Monster with.. these huge big Gnashing TEETH... claws that could rip... (sigh) Look at the Bones MAN!.... and a guy who could be Joe Kowolski's twin brother... everything a good adventure needs! ...more [4 Stars] I thoroughly enjoyed this novel!

It definitely kept me on my toes for the whole duration learning about the native cultures and the different elements of the Amazon rain forest, not to mention all the crazy intense trials the characters have to go through. It's brutal. I think, for a thriller, this book took me longer to get through than I expected. It's just over 400 pages, so it's really not very lengthy. I also didn't fall in love with the characters (Manny and Tor Tor being the exceptions.) I just didn't feel for them if - no, when something terrible would happen to them. I definitely recommend it, and I hope to pick up some more James Rollins books in the future. ...more No wonder Director Spielberg invited him to write the script No doubt the screenwriter of the 5th Indiana Jones movie will still be him With the intrigue,mystery and it's huge landscape of uncharted territory of the Amazon, Rollins takes you on a fun adventure.

Said soldier was the sole survivor of an expedition to the Amazon whose members also included Rand's father, who never returned to civilization. I'm not particularly picky about my fiction, especially \"fun\" fiction, such as novels like these. Action is fast-paced, and the body count mounts early. Episodes of violence reach nearly ridiculous levels, stretching the imagination a little. These are not fantasy books, but yes, in a way, they are. Rollins definitely uses some literary license in pursuit of an interesting story, for sure. That is where Rollins, Crichton, and Cussler sort of ride in their prose. Rollins also melds together many current themes, cancer research, deforestation, the loss of biodiversity and the impact on disease research, and the treatment of native peoples. His characters are often found eloquently speaking about the dangers of cutting down the rain forest, how many species are lost, and the loss of research material that could potentially alleviate current or future diseases of mankind. And, in the process, people get shot, killed, eaten, shot and eaten, eaten and burned, shot and partially eaten and blown-up, and turned into fertilizer. If you've got a plane-ride, bus-ride, or an extended hospital stay, and you want something to keep your attention for a while, this book might do it. ...more \u0997\u09a4 \u0995\u09be\u09b2 \u09b0\u09be\u09a4\u09c7 \u09aa\u09dc\u09c7 \u09b6\u09c7\u09b7 \u0995\u09b0\u09b2\u09be\u09ae, \u099c\u09c7\u09ae\u09b8 \u09b0\u09cb\u09b2\u09bf\u09a8\u09b8 \u098f\u09b0 '\u0986\u09ae\u09be\u099c\u09a8\u09bf\u09df\u09be'.... \u09af\u09be\u09b0 \u09b0\u09c7\u09b6 \u098f\u0996\u09a8\u09cb \u0986\u099b\u09c7\u0964 \u0997\u09b2\u09aa\u09c7\u09b0 \u09b6\u09c1\u09b0\u09c1 \u09b9\u09df, \u09b8\u09bf \u0986\u0987 \u098f\u09b0 \u09b8\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0995\u09b0\u09ae\u0995\u09b0\u09a4\u09be \u099c\u09c7\u09b0\u09be\u09b2\u09a1 \u0995\u09b2\u09be\u09b0\u0995 \u0996\u09c1\u09ac \u09ae\u09c1\u09ae\u09c2\u09b0\u09b7\u09c1 \u0985\u09ac\u09b8\u09a5\u09be\u09df \u0989\u09aa\u09b8\u09a5\u09bf\u09a4 \u09b9\u09df \u098f\u0995 \u09ae\u09bf\u09b6\u09a8\u09be\u09b0\u09c0\u09a4\u09c7.... \u0995\u09bf\u09a8\u09a4\u09c1 \u0995\u09df\u09c7\u0995 \u0998\u09a8\u099f\u09be \u09aa\u09b0\u0987 \u09a4\u09be\u09b0 \u09ae\u09c3\u09a4\u09af\u09c1 \u09b9\u09df\u0964 \u099a\u09be\u09b0 \u09ac\u099b\u09b0 \u0986\u0997\u09c7 \u09b8\u09c7 \u098f\u0995 \u0997\u09cb\u09aa\u09a8 \u09ae\u09bf\u09b6\u09a8\u09c7 \u09af\u09be\u09df \u098f\u0995\u09b9\u09be\u09a4 \u09a8\u09bf\u09df\u09c7 \u0995\u09bf\u09a8\u09a4\u09c1 \u09af\u0996\u09a8 \u09ab\u09bf\u09b0\u09c7 \u0986\u09b8\u09c7 \u09a4\u0996\u09a8 \u09a4\u09be\u09b0 \u09a6\u09c1 \u09b9\u09be\u09a4\u0987 \u0986\u099b\u09c7! \u098f\u099f\u09be \u0995\u09bf \u0995\u09b0\u09c7 \u09b8\u09ae\u09ad\u09ac?

Yes, all those things. A creature feature mixed with Michael Crichtonmixed with Outbreak set in an Indiana Jones/Alan Quartermaine world. Read this. It's awesome. My only qualms was a somewhat rushed ending. Even though I gave this book three stars. For the most part I did find myself enjoying the story. It was an interesting read unlike most of the other books I read. You follow main character Nathan Rand and his adventures. You also follow the O'briars Kelly and Frank. And the characters were my biggest problem with this story. They were very bland. And I did not connect to any of there story's what so ever.

And at certain points it bad way to much filler and things that just didn't need to be there. While I did mention the length being a negative the book was a fast read for being five pages short of a 600 page book. Overall I did enjoy this book and I do plan on reading more James Rollins because I did find this book overall being a good read. I just wish the characters were a little more well developed. ...more \u0995\u09bf\u099b\u09c1\u09a6\u09bf\u09a8 \u0986\u0997\u09c7 \u0987\u0982\u09b2\u09bf\u09b6\u099f\u09be \u09aa\u09dc\u09be \u09b9\u09df\u09c7\u099b\u09c7 \u0995\u09be\u09b2 \u0985\u09a8\u09c1\u09ac\u09be\u09a6\u099f\u09be\u0964 \u0985\u09a8\u09c1\u09ac\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u09a8\u09bf\u09df\u09c7 \u0995\u09bf\u099b\u09c1\u0987 \u09ac\u09b2\u09be\u09b0 \u09a8\u09be\u0987 \u09b8\u09c7\u09b0\u09be\u0964 \u09ac\u0987 \u09a8\u09bf\u09df\u09c7\u0993 \u0995\u09bf\u099b\u09c1 \u09ac\u09b2\u09be\u09b0 \u09a8\u09be\u0987\u0964 \u0985\u09af\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u099c\u09a8\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ad\u0982\u0995\u09b0 \u09b0\u09c2\u09aa \u099c\u09be\u09a8\u09be\u09b0 \u099c\u09a8\u09af \u09b8\u09c7\u09b0\u09be \u09af\u09a6\u09bf\u0993 \u098f\u0987 \u09ad\u09df\u0982\u0995\u09b0 \u09b0\u09c2\u09aa\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ac\u09c7\u09b6\u09bf\u09b0 \u09ad\u09be\u0997\u099f\u09be\u0987 \u09ab\u09bf\u0995\u09b6\u09a8\u0964\u0964 \u09b0\u09cb\u09b2\u09bf\u09a8\u09b8 \u09b8\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u09b2 \u09b2\u09bf\u0996\u09be\u09b0 \u0986\u0997\u09c7 \u09b0\u09bf\u099c\u09c7\u09a8\u09be\u09b0\u09c7\u099f\u09bf\u09ad \u09ac\u09be\u09df\u09cb\u09b2\u099c\u09bf \u09a8\u09bf\u09df\u09c7 \u09ad\u09be\u09b2\u0987 \u09aa\u09dc\u09be\u09b6\u09c1\u09a8\u09be \u0995\u09b0\u09c7\u099b\u09c7\u09a8 \u09ae\u09a8\u09c7 \u09b9\u0987\u099b\u09c7\u0964 \u09b2\u09bf\u09ad\u09bf\u0982 \u099c\u09bf\u09a8 \u09ac\u09af\u09be\u0982\u0995 \u098f\u09b0 \u0986\u0987\u09a1\u09bf\u09df\u09be\u099f\u09be \u0985\u09a8\u09af \u09a7\u09b0\u09a8\u09c7\u09b0 \u09b8\u09be\u09df\u09c7\u09a8\u09b8 \u09ab\u09bf\u0995\u09b6\u09a8\u0964 \u09b8\u09ac \u0995\u09bf\u099b\u09c1 \u09ae\u09bf\u09b2\u09c7 \u09a8\u09a4\u09c1\u09a8\u09a4\u09ac\u0964 \u0995\u09bf\u099b\u09c1\u09a6\u09bf\u09a8 \u0986\u0997\u09c7 \u0987\u0982\u09b2\u09bf\u09b6\u099f\u09be \u09aa\u09dc\u09be \u09b9\u09df\u09c7\u099b\u09c7 \u0995\u09be\u09b2 \u0985\u09a8\u09c1\u09ac\u09be\u09a6\u099f\u09be\u0964 \u0985\u09a8\u09c1\u09ac\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u09a8\u09bf\u09df\u09c7 \u0995\u09bf\u099b\u09c1\u0987 \u09ac\u09b2\u09be\u09b0 \u09a8\u09be\u0987 \u09b8\u09c7\u09b0\u09be\u0964 \u09ac\u0987 \u09a8\u09bf\u09df\u09c7\u0993 \u0995\u09bf\u099b\u09c1 \u09ac\u09b2\u09be\u09b0 \u09a8\u09be\u0987\u0964 \u0985\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u099c\u09a8\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ad\u0982\u0995\u09b0 \u09b0\u09c2\u09aa \u099c\u09be\u09a8\u09be\u09b0 \u099c\u09a8\u09cd\u09af \u09b8\u09c7\u09b0\u09be \u09af\u09a6\u09bf\u0993 \u098f\u0987 \u09ad\u09df\u0982\u0995\u09b0 \u09b0\u09c2\u09aa\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ac\u09c7\u09b6\u09bf\u09b0 \u09ad\u09be\u0997\u099f\u09be\u0987 \u09ab\u09bf\u0995\u09b6\u09a8\u0964\u0964 \u09b0\u09cb\u09b2\u09bf\u09a8\u09cd\u09b8 \u09b8\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u09b2 \u09b2\u09bf\u0996\u09be\u09b0 \u0986\u0997\u09c7 \u09b0\u09bf\u099c\u09c7\u09a8\u09be\u09b0\u09c7\u099f\u09bf\u09ad \u09ac\u09be\u09df\u09cb\u09b2\u099c\u09bf \u09a8\u09bf\u09df\u09c7 \u09ad\u09be\u09b2\u0987 \u09aa\u09dc\u09be\u09b6\u09c1\u09a8\u09be \u0995\u09b0\u09c7\u099b\u09c7\u09a8 \u09ae\u09a8\u09c7 \u09b9\u0987\u099b\u09c7\u0964 \u09b2\u09bf\u09ad\u09bf\u0982 \u099c\u09bf\u09a8 \u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0982\u0995 \u098f\u09b0 \u0986\u0987\u09a1\u09bf\u09df\u09be\u099f\u09be \u0985\u09a8\u09cd\u09af \u09a7\u09b0\u09a8\u09c7\u09b0 \u09b8\u09be\u09df\u09c7\u09a8\u09cd\u09b8 \u09ab\u09bf\u0995\u09b6\u09a8\u0964 \u09b8\u09ac \u0995\u09bf\u099b\u09c1 \u09ae\u09bf\u09b2\u09c7 \u09a8\u09a4\u09c1\u09a8\u09a4\u09cd\u09ac\u0964 ...more I almost read the entire book in one evening, I just couldn't stop.

The main character is Nathan Rand Whose father died while on a mysterious expedition to the Amazon. Nathan is part of a large team sent in to discover what happened to the previous group and hopefully unravel the central mystery.

I've wanted to read something by James Rollins but wasn't certain that this was the first I should try. Fortunately, the friend who recommended it (who has never steered me wrong) knew better as this was an exciting experience. The set up The story takes place in a remote area of the Amazon jungle. A team is sent there to try to find out what happened to a science expedition four years prior. One of the members from that expedition suddenly showed up in one of the villages and died soon after. His physical transformation was inexplicable and the government organized a mission to investigate. Project Amazonia included a team of scientists, U. S. Rangers and the son of the leader of the earlier expedition. The issues The Amazon jungle is like no other environment, with botanical riches that can nurture, heal and destroy you if you don't know what you're doing. The normal hazards facing the team weren't the only problems this group faced as a mercenary was tracking them with evil intentions. They also had to contend with extraordinary situations as they reached and went beyond the region where the first expedition was last tracked. What I really liked about this story Aside from the nail-biting excitement from not knowing what new fresh hell lay around the next bend, the story was rich with cultural lore and botanical insight. I've known intellectually the value of the plant life in the Amazon but this was a fascinating education. It all was used to create a fantastical situation that rivaled any adventure film I've ever seen, laid out in a way that made it seem plausible. The mix of characters was equally interesting, especially with two women on the team. The obstacles they confronted were beyond frightening and as no one was sacred in this story, I never knew who wasn't going to make it to the next challenge. And, there was even a little romance, which I didn't anticipate. What I didn't like so much Not everyone survives this exploration and at times, I felt like the bad guys were always winning or having the advantage. It started to get me down after awhile. I needed more wins for the good guys. The bottom line Amazonia is an incredible story that was tons more interesting and exciting than I ever imagined. I liked the writing style and the characters were well developed. Without giving away too much, this book is equal parts fantasy and adventure as it is mystery and suspense. The treasures and secrets of the Amazon are immeasurable and the story leveraged every part of it. The action started on the first page and it never let up. I'm really glad I read this book. ...more His arm grew back?! 4yrs ago, a government scientific expedition team lead by Dr. Carl Rand had vanished in the unknown depths of the jungle of Amazon.

Now after all these years one of the team members- a special force soldier comes out of the jungle and dies within hours from multiple diseases, scars and molestations. But, he has come out with both of his arm although he had gone in with only one! Now the government decides to lead another expedition to trace back the missing years following the dead soldier's path with a team of scientists and soldiers. They also enlist Nathan Rand(son of Carl Rand) who wants to solve his father's death at any cost with the help of his friends. But little does he know that there is one more contender of their findings who lurches behinds them hiding in their shadows while the unseen horrors and ancient secrets of Amazon waits for all of them! Ok, I was hooked with just the premise itself! The plot is very engaging. I have read many science fiction and adventure novels but mostly those focus on technologies very much. But rarely comes novels like Amazonia which focuses on the raw nature and its horror! the wilderness, the jungle, its animals, weird bugs, medicinal leaves - all of these knits a gripping and enjoyable story which is decorated with stupendous action, chase and one after another twists. The jungle's description and the actions are written so well that it feels like happening in front of the eyes like a movie (will come back to this point). With betrayal, revenge and a good villain thrown into that, James Rollins has really written a fantastic gripping novel. Each of the characters are living through the pages and feels very very realistic. Manny, Prof. Kouwe, Tor-Tor became friends of mine too along with Rand. Nathan Rand is one of the best heroic characters that I have read. His anger, sadness and bravery really leaves a mark on the reader's mind. Sadly the books is very very cinematic at some places. It kind of does feel like a sci-fi adventure movie with little bits of Predator thrown in. But what really hurt me was that the 2nd half of this book is almost a blue print of the movie AVATAR by James Cameroon!! Amazonia came out on 2001-02 whereas AVATAR was out on 2009. The jungle, animals and intriguing story elements are so similar that it feels uncanny to be 'just a coincidence'! It even felt as if Mr. Cameron ripped off some of the pages of this book to write the script. I usually like movies of Mr. Cameron but this sad realisation left a bitterness when I finished the book. I highly recommend this book to any science fiction or adventure lovers. ...more \u099c\u09c7\u09ae\u09b8 \u09b0\u09b2\u09bf\u09a8\u09b8\u09c7\u09b0 \u098f\u09b0 \u0986\u0997\u09c7 \u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09b0 \u098f\u0995\u099f\u09be \u09ac\u0987 \u09aa\u09dc\u09be \u09b9\u09df\u09c7\u099b\u09c7 -

But, this time it was different, and how! This book turned the tables completely for me, in that regard -racy and engaging with plots twisted more than a pretzel, this story is perfect for a movie script. The detailing in the book is extraordinary- the author has done some pretty intensive research not just limited to the Amazon jungle or its denizens, but also with respect to the local flora and fauna( ever heard of chemical warfare in plants?). And that's what impressed me so much - the science behind it all. So many facts and interesting theories that were shrouded amongst those words of speculation and mystery, that by the time I finished reading the book, I was completely baffled. Before I get your expectations soaring, let me clarify that there are sub-plots in the book, which are too good to be true and even predictable at times - for starters, no character is grey, and there is always the smart ass who saves the day ;) But despite all that, what won me over was the painstaking detailing and the sheer brilliance with which he unravelled the story. And at the end of the day, that's what kept me hooked throughout. Verdict : Makes for a thoroughly entertaining read. ...more James Rollins is one of the best adventure writers working today, and this early example of his work is typical of his writing and is a great escape.

If you need sleep, don't start one of his books, as it's very hard to put them down once started. A science/military team is going deep into the rainforest of Brazil, following the years old trail of an earlier expedition that disappeared. The prize: a potential miracle drug with regenerative properties. The dangers are numerous, from monstrous caimans, head-shrinking shamans, man-eating locusts, to double-crossing humans working for morally bankrupt, greedy pharmaceutical corporations. As team members are killed off willy-nilly, time is running out for the desperate, remaining members of the expedition. Readers will be kept guessing as to who survives in this thrill ride of a novel. ...more \u0986\u09ae\u09be\u099c\u09a8, \u098f\u0995 \u09b0\u09b9\u09b8\u09af\u09c7\u09b0 \u09a8\u09be\u09ae\u0964

This beast of a book reads like a movie - an Indiana Jones meets Avatar with CGI of amazing proportions. It ticked quite a few of the right boxes for me: 1. Well researched information - The jungle description and the wilderness is so detailed, that I can only imagine the amount of study Rollins put into writing Amazonia. I found the scientific aspects quite interesting and it usually didn't go too far over my head, so points for that. 2. Atmospheric setting - Green, dark, wet and, at night, creepy as all hell. 3. Interesting protagonists - Even though Nathan Rand was the lead, I enjoyed the characters Kelly and Tor-Tor so much more. 4. Creature feature - The chimeras... what the... 5. Scares - Plenty of them. 6. Plot Twists - Loved the big reveal. Yep, didn't see THAT coming. Slow clap. For the most part, I did find myself enjoying the story and read with my mental- mouth wide open. And in all seriousness, I have to call it a 'fun' adventure buuut... that's all it was for me - Fun - and I wanted it to be so much more. My complaints with the book are few and far between, but they're there. I thought some of the characters (Anna, Kouwe) could have been more fleshed out, and that some other characters (Waxman, Rangers) were not given the credit they deserved. Rand filled the screen. I had to stop myself from rolling my eyes when he saved the day - all day, every day, while everyone else looked on helplessly. And Favre's reasons for desiring vengeance was a little too.. meh? However, the adrenaline-filled pace quite made up for the shortcomings, and I'm glad I started out on this treasure-hunt-type jungle journey. 4 Stars. ...more mp3 Narrated by George Guidall.

This book is pure joy, right from the first, till the last page. Great adventure, great mysteries and great action, mixed with likeable heroes, awesome monsters and extremely villainous baddies. And so much more... one have to read it, to understand how terrific it is. The best from Rollins I have seen so far. it's actually a 100 stars book , but Goodreads didn't allow me to give more than 5 stars ...what a shame :( WHAT AN ADVENTURE .....

There was so much going on in this book, yet it took forever to get anywhere and then the ending just wrapped it up in a pretty bow. I was intrigued to find out what happened and then when I did find out, I was disappointed. ***SPOILERS*** Some whacked out tree from the prehistoric times still thrived, enslaved people, animals, and plants to its sweet healing nectar, and it made a big hupla of devastating deaths all around. I was truly sad when Manny died. I liked how Rollins kept Tor-Tor alive though. I grew attached to that cat. ***End Spoilers!!*** There were a LOT of characters in this book. And I feel like some of them were not given the credit that they deserved. It took 300 pages for them to even get there and then the last chapter wrapped everything up in THREE PAGES! The epilogue drove me nuts!!! (Pun intended.) I don't know. Not my favorite of Rollins, and the only reason I snatched it from the library was because it was one of his early pieces and people were raving about how his newer books are no where near as good as his first ones. I'm going to disagree on that one. I love the Sigma Force novels. I feel more attached to ALL of the characters no matter how small of a role they have. This was a beast of a book too. Like I said so much time was taken to just get there and then when they did the description of this huge white barked tree was not as vivid as all the travesties they have to go through. I wanted to know more about the people who lived there, how they practiced normal daily activities, more about this mysterious sap, it cure all for all diseases. I wanted to know more about what happened to Gerald Clark, and Nate's dad. Why weren't we allowed to read more from his journal?? And how the hell did solar panels get on that roof of that log cabin?? And we never found out the \"true\" meaning of that blue hand print! I already knew who the traitor was well before the whole explosion. I was sick of hearing about caimans and I really wanted Tshui to die more violently. Is that bad of me? And that tree was just f-ed up scary. No thank you. Do not go to this place in the Amazon. Leave it alone people!!! ...more I've read some of the reviews of this book, and I have to say that I really don't think that they (well, some of them) have been fair. If you're looking to read classical literature, read classical literature. If you're looking to read great and wondrous plays, allow me to recommend Shakespeare, Aristophanes, or Moliere.

If you're looking to read classical literature, read classical literature. If you're looking to read great and wondrous plays, allow me to recommend Shakespeare, Aristophanes, or Moliere. If you're looking for romance galore, perhaps Danielle Steele or the Harlequin Classics are more to your liking. However, if you want to read an edge of your seat, page turning thriller (and learn something about the actual area and tribal people), then read this novel. I finished it in 2 1/2 days, so it's not a complicated read, but it's a good one! I truly enjoyed this novel, and I can't think of a moment where I sat here thinking, \"Geez, when is this going to get moving?\" or \"Hmmmmmm...how exquisitely formulaic.\" Sure, there are a few things that are a bit beyond the reaches of reality, but you know what? It's a work of fiction, and it's a thriller! I felt that the main characters were developed as thoroughly as was necessary, and I felt the plot moved along at a good pace. I especially liked what I perceived to be an unspoken commentary on the use of military vs. experts in a field; sometimes we, as a modern society, are so quick to rely on weapons and war no matter what, when really what we need to do is listen to the voices of the people who have expertise in a particular field. Don't get me wrong: there is a time and place for the military, and I respect them tremendously; however, sometimes we become so pompous in our beliefs that we believe our strength and might in one area leads to expertise in all areas, and it doesn't. I think this is shown in the number of military who are lost in the novel while the experts remain, and also, in the deaths of Favre and his mistress, both of whom seem to believe they are invincible. Sometimes we just need to do as Nate says several times in the book, and just, \"Hush,\" and explore other paths that we aren't quick to consider in our modern world. I'm looking forward to reading more of Rollins' novels. ...more I read this on a referral from a friend. He had bought 4 paperback Rollins books and enjoyed them all.

I thought this book was very entertaining. However, the end really went to a place I felt it didn't need to go. The entire book was comprised of realistic points meshed with unrealistic points that seem to tetter on a valid explanation. But at it's climax, Rollins chose to go to a place that stretched me a bit too thin. ...more This was one of the first books that I ever read in this genre. Up until this point it had only been romance, but my husband talked me into reading it. I am so glad I did. It was scary and wonderful all at the same time.

This is the type of book that I like to read at the beach or on a long flight, because once you start reading, it's going to be hard to put down. A scientific expedition led by Carl Rand mysteriously disappears in the Amazon without a trace. Despite a massive manhunt, the team is never recovered and presumed dead. Four years later, a Special Forces soldier from the expedition stumbles out of the forest. The soldier is near death, but what's even stranger about his reappearance is that he had somehow managed to regrow an amputated limb. Does the Amazon hold the secret to limb regeneration? The government knows they're on to something big, as do the pharmaceutical companies involved. A team is sent in to trace the dead soldier's trail. Leading the expedition is a courageous group of Rangers and Carl Rand's son Nathan, an Amazonian forest expert who has two reasons for lending his expertise to the mission: He is an expert on Amazonian tribal culture, and he has a deep desire to reunite with his father, or at least finally uncover the truth to his demise. Nathan knows that the secretive and revered Ben-ali tribe are involved in the mystery, and he is one of a few experts in the world who might be able to uncover the Ben-Ali's secret territory. Nathan's team is being tracked by his father's arch enemy though, and they are a twisted group of villains that will stop at nothing to get their hands on the prize. The jungle also has its fair share of surprises for the team from killer frogs and locusts to giant caiman and leopards. The ante is upped when the team finds out that the dead soldier's body carries a mysterious plague that threatens to decimate the US in a matter of weeks. As Nathan and his team race to find the cure and to uncover the mystery of his father's ill fated team, they realize that they are up against an ancient evil that might be near impossible to stop. ...more<---C>James Rollins</---C>", "Title": "Amazonia"},
