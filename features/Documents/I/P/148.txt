She had some tough times this book, what with having no sexual escapades (the first time ever, although it seems like every male in the town is interested in her--must be the red socks), getting shot, and having part of her house burn down. Unfortunately, it was just her back porch and kitchen that burned, so her collection of hair scrunchies were saved. I've also decided that I'm pretty well over the werewolves in this book. Alcide, a character I liked in past books, is kind of a jerk here and the whole head of the pack competition grossed me out.

No matter what magical cookie perfume she\u2019s wearing, I don\u2019t buy it and moreover it seems like a very flimsy excuse to have all the hot guys in these books pant after her like dogs (at least one of them LITERALLY). In this instalment there\u2019s a Big Bad in the area shooting up the local shifters. The cops can\u2019t see any sort of link between the attacks because they are blissfully unaware of the Shape-Shifters existence. Some crazy werewolf stuff is going down with the Shrevport pack that Sookie gets, unwillingly, dragged into. The murder-mystery element of this story is pretty transparent (possibly even more so than the previous books, which is saying something) and I called who the killer was the moment s/he was introduced. The \u2018romantic\u2019 aspect isn\u2019t as clear here either, what with all the offers coming in from all over the goddamn place. I have bitched to the moon and back about how judgmental I think Sookie is as a character and that hasn\u2019t changed at all here. I know that she is a telepath and therefore hears any number of thoughts that one would not necessarily want to hear but that does NOT give her licence to judge every fucking person who crosses her path. Seriously?! Cut this shit out, Sook! We\u2019d all like to kill what we don\u2019t understand, what scares us, and I powerfully scared Andy Bellefleur. Ex-muthafucking-cuse me??? Speak for yourself! I don\u2019t want to kill things I don\u2019t understand, even if they scare me\u2026. I want to understand them. In the world I lived in, the world of human people, there were ties and debts and consequences and good deeds. That was what bound people to society; maybe that was what constituted society. And I tried to live in my little niche the best way I could. Well now, don\u2019t get all maudlin on us now, Sookie. I refuse to believe that all of society swarms around feeling indebted to people, sure that aspect exists but that\u2019s not all that humanity is. Bleh. Shhhhhhh, Eric, just stand there and look sexy! And I will NEVER, and I do mean NEVER, picture you in the clothes that Harris describes you as wearing. I know these books are dated but a brown suit with a gold belt?! REALLY?! Ew. ...more Oh, Sookie Sookie. Another fun read, but I\u2019m not feeling as passionate about Sookie & Co. after this installment. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I enjoyed it. Thoroughly. And you can bet your buns I\u2019ve already requested #6 from the library and will be checking my account furiously for notification that it\u2019s ready and waiting for me.

And you can bet your buns I\u2019ve already requested #6 from the library and will be checking my account furiously for notification that it\u2019s ready and waiting for me. But some of the magic was missing from this one. In the beginning of the book, Calvin Norris and Sam Merlotte were non-fatally shot and another female shifter, whose name I\u2019ve already forgotten, was shot and killed in the parking lot of a Sonic. And a news report indicates that many other people in nearby areas have also been shot by a sniper in mysterious circumstances. Although the world at large may not realize the significance of the snipers victims, Sookie and several others in the community realize that all the targets have been shifters. There were two bad guys in this whodunit. One of them I was able to guess right away, one of them was a surprise to me. After having read the first five in this series in a relatively short succession, this pleases me. Because if I was able to consistently guess them over and over, I might get bored and not want to read these books and that would be a bummer. And like the previous four books, Sookie\u2019s love life is generally a big factor in the plot. Even though she\u2019s decidedly unattached and doesn't sleep with anybody this time around, she is being actively pursued by several men. This includes Bill and Eric. And Sam, of course. And Calvin Norris and Alcide Herveaux. Sookie also learns quite a bit more about werewolf politics, learns how to file an insurance claim and what a gunshot wound feels like. Lastly, I can\u2019t end a Sookie Stackhouse review without pointing out the inconsistency du jour of this book: on an early page, Claudine the fairy is referred to as Claudine several times. But then whammo! In one paragraph she is called \u201cClaudette\u201d once before going back to being Claudine. If something this simple isn\u2019t being caught, this probably gives you an idea about some of the other things that are sliding by the editors. ...more Another good installment in the Sookie Stackhouse series.

It seems to me that at times Charlaine Harris isn't able to keep her details straight. Granted, she has written A LOT and I can certainly understand confusing the details in that situation, but surely any decent editor would have caught these types of discrepancies... For example: - (Book 1) Fang-bangers became fangbangers. (This isn't a huge issue, but the hyphen was used originally, and therefore should be afterwards.) - (Books 1-5) Kevin Prior turned into Kevin Pryor, and then back to Prior, and then back again to Pryor. - Jason's boss is Shirley (Catfish) Hennessey in Book 4, but in Book 5, all of a sudden he's Shirley (Catfish) Hunter . What?!? This is kind of a pet-peeve of mine. It's a petty thing, I know, but it is annoying. In my opinion, Harris has created a world of detail in these books, and it seriously detracts from the enjoyment of the story when those details change from book to book in the series. I wish that Sookie would stop being so friggin' unreasonable when it comes to disagreements. If she would just hear someone out one day rather than storming off in a huff, she might be better off! ...more I did not like this story as much as book 4, which is by far my favorite so far (I am a sucker for memory-challenged Eric), but it was still an interesting tale. However, after having too many suitors, Sookie is fast running out of potential soul mates. Eric is back to being his old arrogant self, Bill is sulking around with a realtor, Alcide is freaked out Sookie killed his ex and blames her for his father's death and Sam is incapacitated from being shot (although they did share a heated moment I did not like this story as much as book 4, which is by far my favorite so far (I am a sucker for memory-challenged Eric), but it was still an interesting tale.

Eric is back to being his old arrogant self, Bill is sulking around with a realtor, Alcide is freaked out Sookie killed his ex and blames her for his father's death and Sam is incapacitated from being shot (although they did share a heated moment in his office that Bill interrupted) While Sookie did meet the alluring Quinn (who I am sure will show up in future books) no major love interests have popped in. Which for me meant the storyline needed to be a bit tighter to fill in the lack of romantic gaps. However, the drama in this book was increidbly less after the previous stories filled with much death and destruction. Sookie having part of her house burned was sad, Tara's story a bit throw-away, but the climax, the packmaster duel at the end, was just disappointing in its fercoity rather than exhilarating in action. And the whole sniper against shifters and hit man after Sookie felt weak. Still better than book two's very weak story, but not as thrilling as the other novels. It will be interesting to see were things go with this. NOw that Eric knows the secret he and Sookie share will he act on it? And will Bill ever come around and wise up? Or Sam? And Alcide, who needs to stop blaming everyone else for his problems, he needs to grow up. Plus Jason is still an ass, caring more about his butt not being a suspect than his sister getting shot. All in all the men in Sookie's life leave much to be desired. She is still as spunky and great as ever, but needs better guys to work with. ...more Dnf~29% This book was on my TR shelf since forever. I loved the first one and kinda liked the other 3 books, but this is too boring. I really don't care what happens to Jason, I never liked him anyway. I'm not interested in his story-line. Maybe it's the fact that I've watched \" True blood \", which I liked very much (all those hot guys :D), but I can't make myself continue this series. There are many much more interesting books out there. I read this book quickly this morning, while waiting for visits from my condo board & a plumber. It was a good distraction from the water leaking from my bathroom ceiling AGAIN. I swear these Sookie novels are addictive, I immediately wanted to read the next one (I\u2019d go shopping, except I\u2019m still waiting to hear from the plumber). I\u2019ve never been one to watch soap operas, but that is the only thing that I can think to compare this series to.

I\u2019ve never been one to watch soap operas, but that is the only thing that I can think to compare this series to. I read to find out who did what to whom, figure out why they did it, and to see who Sookie ends up with eventually. There\u2019s a lot of men in the running\u2014Eric, Bill, Sam, Alcide, Calvin, maybe even Quinn. That\u2019s a lot of guys to juggle, especially when they all seem to be using some kind of tit-for-tat scoring system that seems to make Sookie beholden to each of them. But you know, all women in our society have to deal with entitled men all the time\u2014the neighbour who wants to carry your groceries so he can see the inside of your house, the guy who \u201chelps\u201d you with your suitcase so you feel obligated to go for coffee with him, the guy who is paid to paint your bathroom (and you suspect that he wants to be alone to go through your underwear drawer), the friend\u2019s husband who thinks it\u2019s okay to make a suggestive comment. Hey, I\u2019m an old, fat lady and I still have to deal with all these guys. This is life as a woman\u2014worse for single women, but a fact of life for all of us. It\u2019s tiresome and omnipresent. So I feel for Sookie. She attracts the supernatural sorts, I attract the creepy guys. We\u2019re both just a little too friendly, a little too nice. I\u2019m working on my force field and Miss Sookie needs to as well. My parents raised me to be polite and pleasant to other people. I just can\u2019t believe how many of those people seem to think that makes me an easy mark. And how many men think that lifting something for you somehow entitles them to much more of your attention. I guess there are plenty of people in the world who are dying for attention of any kind, and if you treat them like a human being, they read far too much into that. What a sad comment on the state of our world. But back to Sookie, I can hardly wait to get my hands on the next volume and see which of this bunch of guys manages to win her attention. ...more Pero que manera de terminar el libro es est\u00e1, dej\u00e1ndonos con la miel en los labios?

It markets a synthetic blood beverage, so natch, I was intrigued. Basically, I was led to this series which features a telepathic heroine by the name of Sookie Stackhouse. For whatever reason, I thought this was a young adult series (it is SO not, btw) and on shallow reflection, I think it's because of her name: Sookie. I mean c'mon. It sounds like a sound you make to call pigs to you. However, other t I cottoned onto the Southern Vampire Series because I saw the \"True Blood\" ad campaign by HBO.

For whatever reason, I thought this was a young adult series (it is SO not, btw) and on shallow reflection, I think it's because of her name: Sookie. I mean c'mon. It sounds like a sound you make to call pigs to you. However, other than her weird name and some pretty bad editing, this series, thus far, is just good plain, slightly porno, FUN! In a nutshell you have a 20-something virginal blond telepathic waitressing in rural Louisiana who hooks up with a sexy vampire. Trouble abounds in their relationship, and in the town, and complications arise due to the affections of another, more powerful vampire, a Werewolf, a nasty coven of Witches and two shape shifters. Our heroine goes from being perceived as being a freak of nature by her fellow humans to a truly hot commodity within the supernatural world. I find Sookie's struggle to deal with these attentions endearing. It would have been so easy for the author, Charlaine Harris, to add a serious subtext to this series with the emergence of Vampires into human society and their struggle to mainstream as a metaphor for racism and the battle for civil rights. However, this story is told from Sookie's perspective and Sookie is a pretty simple, straight forward gal who just doesn't delve into murky socio-political territories. You could argue that Harris is taking the easy way but I'll just call it consistent characterization. Maybe Harris herself doesn't bother herself with such thoughts but why hold it against her? Not every book has to be a deep examination of the human experience. I'll tell you what this book is though: a lively creation of an alternate reality where creatures humans always assumed were fabricated nightmares, have essentially \"come out of the coffin.\" But Harris doesn't limit herself to vampires and I give her a lot of credit for that. She plays with other mythological beings and crafts these really fun murder mysteries set in the Deep South and throws in some steamy love scenes all the while. (Is it considered necrophilia if you do It with a vampire? Just wondering.) It's been a long time since I've had so much fun reading a story like this. ...more Like Sookie\u2019s fashion sense, this series is stuck in the 80\u2019s. I have come to expect Sookie to mention her hair, nails, and boobs, but this time she threw in lipstick for good measure and the result is comically cringe worthy. Any author who pens a heroine who matches her socks to her lippy and earrings, is bound to also write obscenely ridiculous \u201cman\u201d fantasies, a la the Sookie Stackhouse Series.

I\u2019m circa 1985, so I have never fantasized over a man who wears bikini briefs, or is attractive only because he has good benefits, or drives a truck and works construction, or lives in a trailer behind his small town bar, or is the undead version of Michael Bolton (Sorry Bill). If my tongue is going to wag, it\u2019s going to be for someone spectacularly badass. I thought I had found that someone in Eric, but I can\u2019t help but judge him for his continued interest in Sookie, or grow tired of Sookie for her inept ponderings on both life and love. I suppose Harris is a good mystery writer, I only guessed one of the bad guys, but her books are becoming extremely over the top, just like an 80\u2019s movie. There is no real rhyme or reason to the series and I have grown weary of Sookie and all of her many admirers. I read urban fantasy to experience something surreal in a modern day setting, but Sookie\u2019s misadventures evoke visions of Steel Magnolias with vamps, weres, fey and shifters. If it weren\u2019t for the TV series, I would have quit this series after book one. For that, I give kudos to Alexander Skarsgard, who makes one fine Eric. ...more Well in case you can't tell, I'm hooked on this series. It's so much more than the HBO True Blood series.

He has his memory back, but with his time spent with Sookie missing. It is driving him crazy to know what happened between them, but Sookie won't tell. When she finally, finally, has to give in and tell him, so that he will help her, the exchange is pretty hilarious. \"Did we have sex?\" he asked me directly. For about two minutes, this might actually be fun. \"Eric,\" I said, \"we had sex in every position I could imagine, and some I couldn't. We had sex in every room in my house, and we had sex outdoors. You told me it was the best you'd ever had...too bad you can't remember it.\" Eric looked like I'd hit him in the forehead with a mallet... \"Is there anything else I should know?\" \"You offered to give up your position as sheriff and come to live with me. And get a job.\" huh? But, as I said, Eric is not hugely present in this book. It's a darn shame! Instead we get a story that is more about the werewolves and other were-critters. They are being killed by a sniper and Sookie is also being targeted by a murderer. She has her house burned down and gets shot, but she should be used to this sort of thing by now. Pam (on the phone): \"What's up?\" \"I got shot.\" \"Oh, too bad,\" she said. \"Eric, do you know what Sookie is telling me? Someone shot her.\" \"Don't get so emotional, Pam,\" I said. Someone might think you care.\" She laughed. I like Pam. I love a cold-hearted, tough female in my books. Sometimes I wish I could rip out someone's throat when they're whining too! Man up! So, the focus in the book is on the Were's, as I said, and I came to the realization that I'm not a fan of the Were's. They are kind of jerks. Really emotional jerks. Besides, why would Sookie want a guy who can bring home fleas and might get hair all over her furniture? oh, no! You are NOT coming in the house like that! Bad boyfriend! I say that she should stick with the vamps! ...more Fangtasia's new bartender is a Pirate; The Shreveport wolves are about to have a new Packmaster; A sniper is targeting shifters and most importantly....

There was more world building through the ceremony that would decide the new Packmaster, and a new character who'll probably be sticking around is introduced. As for Alcide... What can I say? I never was a fan of his but...Let's just say that there was a twist in the plot that made him lose some Sookie points. First Bill, now Alcide, I hope the same doesn't happen to Eric. Speaking of Eric, I wish there was more of him in this book. Three scenes weren't nearly enough for the fun element that he brings into this series. Pam too.

A whole parade of men tramp through Sookie's life wanting her attention and more: Eric, Bill, Sam, Alcide, Calvin and the new guy, Quinn. It gets quite crowded at times!

It's probably my least favorite of the series so far. At this point, the novelty of little Southen Sookie is starting to wear thin. Harris has clearly established that \"any woman worth her salt\" does sensible things, is tough, doesn't put up with anyone's crap, and can clean a mean house. Thank you, 1952!

But I think if one looks deeper into the story (assuming this is even possible), the entire series can be viewed as an allegory for women's liberation. In book 1 Sookie starts out as a piece of eye candy. The Bon Temps natives either want to bed her or are terrified of her. Sometimes both. But as Sookie comes in contact with more and more supernatural beings she no longer views her telepathy as a \"disability\" but is instead begins to use it. This is similar to women discovering that their sexuality is not a curse and beginning to use it to their advantage (i.e. take control of it instead of letting it control them). Perhaps the supe's themselves, and their effect on Sookie, can be compared to the development of the Birth Control Pill, which is often credited with giving women control over their bodies but also leading to more promiscuity. Sookie certainly had more freedom and pleasure once she was \"freed\" from inadvertent mind reading by the blank minds of the vampires, but she also faced many difficulties and battles (literally!). All this said, perhaps this reader's taken entirely too many literature and social psychology classes. Perhaps this book is just a bit of literary cotton-candy. ...more The fifth installment of the Sookie Stackhouse series, Dead as a Doornail , was one I didn't care as much for the first time through. On re-reading it, I found I liked it quite a bit better. Someone is taking shots at the local shifters, and Sookie's brother Jason--newly made a werepanther--is under suspicion.

The werepanther leader Calvin and the werewolf Alcide have not yet abandoned their interest in her, while her ex-lover Bill seems bent on making her jealous. Meanwhile, someone actively has it in for Sookie, going so far as to burn down her house. This is the book that initially made me crinkle my nose, as it introduces the weretiger Quinn, and that sort of went over a line for me of \"one too many supernatural males interested in Sookie\". But that one objection doesn't detract from a basically solid and engaging story. It's not too difficult to ID the perpetrators, but I didn't mind that much. Most entertainingly, the vampire Eric spends a good chunk of the book driven to distraction trying to remember the events of Book 4--and when Sookie finally gives in and tells him what he's unable to remember, that only increases his frustration. This for me is the high point of the plot, since it lays down intriguing hints of what's to come as I plow into new territory with books 6 and 7. For this one, three and a half stars. ...more Worse and worse. Yet another Stackhouse \u201cmystery\u201d principally made up of Sookie flirting with every man of her acquaintance in turn, doing her hair, painting her nails, choosing her various hideous outfits and unnecessarily judging people she barely knows for the flimsiest and most vacuous of reasons, e.g : \u201cHis companion\u2019s face might have been sculpted from marble. Had the woman never heard of a tanning bed?\u201d . Presumably in Sookie\u2019s world the only skin tones acceptable are dead or orange. The Worse and worse. Yet another Stackhouse \u201cmystery\u201d principally made up of Sookie flirting with every man of her acquaintance in turn, doing her hair, painting her nails, choosing her various hideous outfits and unnecessarily judging people she barely knows for the flimsiest and most vacuous of reasons, e.g : \u201cHis companion\u2019s face might have been sculpted from marble. Had the woman never heard of a tanning bed?\u201d . Presumably in Sookie\u2019s world the only skin tones acceptable are dead or orange. The new element in this reheated trash is an English pirate vampire. You can tell he\u2019s a pirate because he wears an eye-patch, has pirate facial hair, wears a pirate shirt and scarf and introduces himself as a pirate. That\u2019s about as subtle as Harris gets. With similar skill she has named him \u201cSir\u201d Charles Twining, presumably after Prince Charles and Twinings tea, they being the only two English things she could think of. He is, according to Eric \u201cthe least temperamental vampire I\u2019ve ever met, though I confess I don\u2019t know him well. He\u2019s been working here only two weeks.\u201d Which seems rather a rash judgement, particularly from someone who has had more than a thousand years in which to learn character assessment and the dangers of hastiness. Besides the introduction of this dull new vampire, barely differentiated from any of Harris\u2019 previous leaden attempts at characterisation, almost nothing happens. The majority of the book is taken up with repetitious material from previous books and mind-numbing descriptions of the exact damage Sookie\u2019s house suffers in a fire, and the repairs she intends to make. These would no doubt be of interest to me if I worked for Sookie\u2019s insurance company, but since this is not the case I struggled to care. Meanwhile Sookie continues to lust after any male she meets and equally to hate every female, for such excellent reasons as wearing too much make-up, the aforementioned not having a tan, of for having the temerity to be seen anywhere near Sookie\u2019s ex. Although obviously it is perfectly acceptable for Sookie to be all over anyone else\u2019s ex, and any other male in her vicinity. Finally the \u201cmystery\u201d of who is behind a spate of shootings is solved via two explanations, one a pathetically basic excuse for character motivation dispensed with in two paragraphs, and the other a convoluted string of barely-related events that even Sookie finds to make little sense. Sookie is once again sexually harassed by a potential new love interest, various characters we don\u2019t really know end up dead, and the next book in this relentlessly poor series is clumsily set-up. Most Ridiculous New Character Name Sweetie Des Arts Jeff LaBeff Randall Shurtliff \u2013 Do they not have the expression \u201cShirt-Lifter\u201d in the USA? Twins Dixon and Dixie Selah Pumphrey Most Worrying Fact About Merlotte\u2019s Any woman not dressed up according to local standards (e.g not in a skin-tight cocktail dress or a terra-cotta pant suit, with full make-up) is working. If she isn\u2019t clearly garbed as a prostitute then the only other work she can possibly be doing is dealing drugs. Obviously in Bon Temps it doesn\u2019t do for a woman to flaunt the dress code unless she doesn\u2019t mind some pretty unpleasant assumptions being made about her. Vainest Self-Description / Worst Synonym for \u201cBreasts\u201d \u201cI knew he was taking in my jeans, which were on the tight side, and my tummy,which was on the flat side, and my soft fuzzy white sweater, which was filled with natural bounty.\u201d Most Repetitive Use of Telepathy Sookie stops a drunk causing trouble by reading his mind and discovering that the most effective weapon to use against him is his fear of upsetting his mother. Ten pages later she does exactly the same thing with another drunk in another bar. Presumably all drunks in her area have unresolved mother issues. In which case, I wonder why she bothers to read their minds at all. Most Sexist Statement \u201cEvery woman wants to know what\u2019s appropriate to wear,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks. I won\u2019t wear pants.\u201d In reference, incidentally, to dressing for a funeral. Particularly badly phrased if you\u2019re British, where pants often means underwear. Although Sookie probably would go to a funeral with no knickers on if Alcide told her to. Most Airheaded Statement \u201cFinally, I felt relaxed, and when I crawled into my bed I had achieved peace through pampering.\u201d Most Affectedly Provincial Statement \u201cI was a little shocked at the idea of one man owning two cars:\u201d Most Annoying Avoidance of Swearing \u201cEffing\u201d/ \u201cEff off.\u201d Just say fuck, Sookie. If Harris can\u2019t bring herself to make Sookie swear then she should just avoid the issue altogether, as writing the phrase \u201cNo effing thanks\u201d is an invitation to ridicule. \u201cJesus Christ, shepherd of Judea.\u201d Sookie says this at least three times per book. Each time it seems more ridiculous than the last. Worst Display of Detective Abilities \u201cI assumed the shooter was almost certainly a guy. I knew plenty of women who went hunting and plenty more with access to rifles. But weren\u2019t snipers always men?\u201d Sookie once again demonstrates that she is not bright. Speaking of which\u2026 Stupidest Thing Sookie Does Re-enter the burning house she has just been rescued from in order to get her handbag, keys and slippers. Even when she can\u2019t find the slippers she risks her life to get a pair of socks. Most Puzzling Statement \u201cThe man\u2019s wallet proved to be in his jacket, which seemed a little unusual to me\u201d I assume I\u2019m missing summat here. How is this unusual? Admittedly it later transpires that the character apparently never kept his wallet in his jacket pocket, but even leaving aside how unlikely it is that someone would be known for where they keep their wallet, there is no way Sookie could know this. Another example of Harris labouring the \u201cclues\u201d in her \u201cmystery\u201d so heavily that they actually become nonsensical continuity errors. Most Socially Na\u00efve Statement Sookie on finding out that some men have used a woman for sex: \u201cBut this is America,\u201d I protested. \u201cHow can they do that?\u201d After this ridiculous remark, and presumably in a bid to prevent any slur on the name of her beloved country or her beloved men, Sookie is as always quick to lay blame on the woman in question for getting involved in this situation, as always not letting any empathy or fellow-feeling prevent her from judging others. Eric supports this misogyny, and soon Tara is thoroughly chastised for inconveniencing poor little good-girl Sookie by having been used and mistreated by two vampires whose strength and power she has no recourse against. Incidentally, Tara\u2019s crime is to have become sexually involved with two vampires, and to have accepted gifts from both of them. Since Sookie has done exactly the same thing I have difficulty in seeing why the weight of the author\u2019s moral judgement comes down so hard on Tara alone. Worst Character \u201cBubba.\u201d Please just leave it now. It\u2019s not funny, it\u2019s not clever, and it apparently necessitates his whole back-story being reeled off once per book. Plus he contributes nothing, except illustrating the fact that Harris cannot conceive of anyone who is not a fan of Elvis. No matter how many hundreds of years you have been alive, how many sights you have seen and how much music you have heard, you must love \u201cThe King.\u201d This particular appearance from him is particularly bad, as it occasions a truly terrible Columbo-style \u201cand one last thing\u201d moment from Sookie. Although being as mentally deficient as Sookie is this moment doesn\u2019t come until after the secret assassin has revealed themselves and attacked her. Which to be honest is a little late for deduction, although Sookie seems proud of herself. I can only be thankful that he has yet to appear in the True Blood TV series. Although if he does it will at least indicate exactly when the show has crossed the line into appalling, and therefore when I should stop watching. ...more I got through this one too quickly.

And Sookie, well, she's put her supermegaultra hots for Eric behind her after he becomes his scary boss-man-vamp self again; she's not ready to forgive Bill for her two-books-ago scare at his cheatin' hands; so...what's a lusty lassie of twenty-odd to do, with all that muscular alpha-male sex appeal on the hoof courting her? Yep. You would too, don't even front. Problem is, in the course of involving herself in the affairs of the weres, Sookie sees and learns things she can't unsee or forget, or really even do more than just...tolerate. Walking on the wild side isn't always comfortable. Sometimes it's downright upsetting. Sookie, you see, is a good girl at heart, a real believer in do-unto-others and possessor of a very starchy sense of honor. Getting involved in the werewolf pack's life causes the starch to chafe parts of her sensibilities. But involved she is, and she's savvy enough to know that involved is safer for her than bystanding could ever be. Here at last I feel the need to bring up True Blood , the HBO TV series based on the Sookie-verse. Note that I don't say based on the books. The characters' names and essential beings, some of the events, a few grace notes are all lifted from the books, but the show is radically different in many ways. One of them is the role of Tara, Sookie's human pal who owns a dress shop and (in this book) gets tangled up with a nasty, nasty vampire, and needs serious rescuing from him. Tara in the series is, well, she's a force of nature and she's a hard-livin' hard-lovin' hot mama. Not so in the novels, not even a little bit. Sookie rescues Tara, but at a cost to their ancient friendship. It's one of the ways Harris makes the series so compulsively readable, addictively followable: she never hesitates to give actions consequences. Things aren't all cozy-cozy in the Sookie-verse. People die, and people still here fall from grace, and people we love show their dark sides and we love them a little differently for it. Sometimes respect goes away, sometimes it comes back, but never ever is the relationship the way it once was. And Sookie's character is such that, even though she knows that things have changed, she sees the good that's (usually) still there and accepts the shadows as they come. The ending of this particular book wraps a thread in the vampire story more tightly around Sookie, as she and Eric face together a threat to their mutual survival and happiness. Eric is driven mad by the hole in his memories from the last book's witch war. He knows something happened, and he knows Sookie knows what it is, and his body carries residual feelings for Sookie...and she ain't tellin' what happened. How to control a control freak in one easy lesson. Go Sook.

Sookie is at her most irritating as she becomes entwined in two major plot lines: a traditional werewolf power ritual, and some sniper running around shooting shifters. Contrary to the dust jacket\u2019s implications, Jason\u2019s experiences as a were-panther are explored absolutely not at all. I wish Harris would switch away from Sookie\u2019s perspective once in a while because she really sucks. Everything is always about her and whatever man is slobbering over her at the moment. I would enjoy hearing Jason describe his panther exploits! It would be a welcome break to the tedium that is Sookie\u2019s wardrobe decisions. Such a klassy lady! Also, it helps if the big whodunit reveal is a character we have actually gotten the chance to know! All of the twists in this book feel slow and tired. This is certainly not the best example of Harris' ability to write fun, light fiction!

I loved the whole werewolf politicalness of choosing a new packmaster and was very sad with the results, I don't think this will bode well for Sookie in the long run.
