Well, no one would yawn reading Karl Wiggins' history. What would more likely to hurt through this reading would be your stomach' muscles - too much laughing can do that. I can attest that I enjoyed every word of this book, every single one of them (even if there were small parts I did not agree with, those who came dangerously close to the areas of my expertise ;-)). I would recommend this book to everyone who wants to learn while having a good time. I would put this book into the high-school program as well.

Karl, irrepressible, irreverent, more than a little bonkers \u2013 and I love him to bits. You won\u2019t learn an awful lot of conventional history from Shit My History Teacher Did Not Tell Me, but you will learn that just as the paradigms are important, those big events that take us another step forward to where we are today, there are events on that long, slow journey, that bring us to the point of being fully rounded, three dimensional sentient beings. There are a myriad of tales within Karl\u2019s book and Karl is a formidable story teller.<---F> Ahh, history</---F>. Karl\u2019s school must have had the same ethos for teaching history as mine. I think our history lessons began at around 9 years old and were utterly dull and boring. Goodness knows what it must have been like for the teacher aiming to impart some sort of knowledge to us\u2026as an adult I can now see that poor Miss Worsley must have been as bored as her pupils. Just as Karl kept a surreptitious eye on Miss Kingsley\u2019s boobs, Miss Worsley\u2019s boobs must have been a constant embarrassment to her. Miss Worsley was a staunch Methodist and she dressed appropriately. A below the knee brown skirt. Brown lace up shoes with thick natural coloured stockings and a baggy green, or beige, jumper. We were all fascinated by Miss Worsley\u2019s boobs, which were huge and completely dominated her appearance. Her boobs were out of control. Sometimes, they were tightly harnessed, inside what must have been a painful, tightly boned brassiere. At other times they swung loose, voluptuous, moving with each inhale and each exhale beneath her wooly jumper. Her attempts to get control over her boobs was a dismal failure. Far more attention was paid to Miss Worsley\u2019s boobs than anything that uttered forth from her mouth. History was just as dull in Mr Fletcher\u2019s class and followed pretty much the same time frame as it had in Miss Worsley\u2019s class. The Ice Age, The Stone Age, The Bronze Age, The Iron age\u2026I should be an expert in those periods, but I\u2019m not. History lessons were for daydreaming away the interminable boredom. By the time we reached Mr Philpott\u2019s class, we\u2019d given up all hope of history being interesting, it didn\u2019t occur to us that it could be entertaining. And we were right, it was neither engaging nor entertaining, it was dry and boring; although Mr Philpott did get beyond the Iron Age. He skimmed over 4 centuries of Roman occupation in Britain, missed out the decades of the Saxons and just about made it through to the Norman Conquest of 1066 when poor King Harold got his eye pierced by an invader\u2019s arrow, before school finished for the summer. But, hang on, I\u2019m meant to be talking about Karl\u2019s book; I\u2019m just saying that my history education was as dull as Karl\u2019s and countless others. I know that they do things differently in schools now \u2013 thank goodness. For a while I gave my neighbour\u2019s kid some help with his homework and he had a project about how the Romans made the roads so straight. Now that was really interesting. That would have got me intrigued with history at school. And because I keep getting sidetracked, I\u2019ll return to my opening sentence; Karl\u2019s book is an absolutely brilliant read! Karl is not obsessed with chronology; that is not the way history works for him. Karl is interested in the stuff that we don\u2019t always think too much about. And he does it so well; where our ideas come from? The ideas that prompt us into thinking about morality; who gave us our ideas of what is right and what is wrong? What was going on in other parts of the world, while we in Britain hadn\u2019t yet discovered fire? Countries in what we now think of as the Middle East, had written language, astronomy, geometry and mathematics while we were still pondering the wheel. And running through Karl\u2019s book is his infectious, irrepressible humour. He\u2019s a wonderful satirist and more than anything, he loves to prick the bubble of pomposity. His humour is affectionate and engaging; laughter is a powerful tool and should be used more in education. Kids are a darn sight more likely to focus an interest in a subject if they can have a good laugh \u2013 and that goes for all of us. Kids will love Karl\u2019s book and so will adults. You\u2019re not going to learn a lot about the Industrial Revolution, or the Peasant\u2019s Revolt; but you will see the progress and process of history in all its vibrant, vivid colour. It\u2019s a great story and it\u2019s our story. ...more Mr. Wiggins has done it again. This book is an eclectic group of facts most of us learned in school, but Wiggins has taken it a step further and provided details left out of our education. Along with those details he has inserted his opinion and his sharp wit, making me laugh out loud on many occasions . Karl Wiggins is brilliant. Loved the book! Carole McKee, author If profanity offends you or you cling to a specific set of beliefs, this book will probably offend you. I'm not a history buff, but it was interesting and I always love to hear different perspectives. All that said, it was comically written, and I thought it was hilarious. I also loved the Harry Potter references sprinkled throughout.<---C>Karl Wiggins</---C><+++>Shit my History Teacher DID NOT tell me!</+++>", "Title": "Shit my History Teacher DID NOT tell me!"},
