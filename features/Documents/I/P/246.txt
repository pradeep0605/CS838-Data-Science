{"Comments": "The transformation in Karla is heart pounding. Trying to figure out this very different world is full of excitement and mystery.

It was fast-paced and intense but I felt connected to the characters so it wasn\u2019t even close to one of those mindless action novels. The heroine Karla has definitely woken up to the dire importance of her situation, but that only makes it worse as she not only battles old faces but new ones when she tries to defend those she loves, never mind herself. Constantly fighting her own inner demons she grows to be someone so much stronger than before, and I can only imagine where this new strength will take her. Paul has always stuck by her side and while I love him, I don\u2019t think he can compare with the enigma that is Lucas. Their chemistry is undeniable and has led to Paul in my eyes being pushed into the friend zone, but Karla hasn\u2019t decided quite yet (there\u2019s also the problem with Lucas betraying her, plus soon to be becoming her worst enemy intent on killing Misfeata who exists inside her).<---F> All\u2019s fair in love and war</---F>.

For now, things are quiet, by Karla\u2019s body has taken a beating, both from outward attacks and from Misfeata. Karla was betrayed by the man she thought she loved, while holding her human friend at a distance. Did her heart make the wrong choice? Paul has always been there for her and her guilt at continually endangering him is mounting. This world is unforgiving, there seems to be no peace to be had, as a disastrous war becomes inevitable between demon factions. Who is the Elemental Breather called Taskatae? How does she have power over Karla? Now the object of another faction's ire, how will Karla find her parents and rid herself of the Shielder demon within? And now, her heart\u2019s betrayer has returned, but he is not alone, why should she trust him? His father is her greatest enemy. You may need roller skates on your eyeballs to keep up with this wicked fast-paced fantasy. Once again, Kia Carrington-Russell has added just the right amount of danger, drama, tension and stress without slowing down as she takes us from page to page, scene to scene and battle to battle. Karla has matured, toughened up, but she is still the teen, who, until recently never knew this world existed. Ms. Carrington-Russell is on a roll and I\u2019m looking forward to her next addition to this series. I received a copy from Kia Carrington-Russell in exchange for my honest review.

Along the way they find that they will have to go up against an enemy none of them have ever faced before, Taskatae. When Karla finally finds her parents nothing could have prepared her for the utter devastation she feels when the unimaginable happens. In a bid to keep her mother safe Karla decides she must continue her battle with Misfeata who is still wanting to possess her body and soul in order to kill her elder brother Tyron who now resides in Lucas' brother. Will Karla and co be able to defeat Taskatae? Can Karla admit to her feelings for Lucas and kill his brother even knowing that once he is dead Tyron will then inhabit Lucas meaning she would have to kill him?? What happens when there is a surprise reunion for Karla with a family member?? This is another great book by a greatly talented author. I really felt for Karla in this book more so than I did in the previous one, after all she has been through to find out that Taskatae is in fact after her whilst still battling Misfeata's attempts at possessing her must be so draining but she never seemed to let it get to her. She clearly has feelings for both Paul and Lucas but won't let either of them know.. I don't blame her for not letting Lucas know after what he had done to her. I loved Paul he is so clearly in love with Karla to have followed her all over all he wants to do is protect her from everything even though he is only human he does his best. Lucas redeemed himself in this book for me as even though he knows once his brother\u2019s dead, Tryon will try and possess him, he vows to Karla that he will never hurt her. He would rather run away and stay away from her rather than fight or harm her. He clearly loves her as well as Paul does. I loved this book and would recommend it to others. ...more Since there are plenty of reviews that discuss the storyline, I won't be going into details of the plot.

I'd classify it as urban fantasy, leaning a bit towards the dark side of the genre This is the second book in a series set in a world where the paranormal lies below the surface of normal human life, hidden from view. Told from Karla's first person point of view, you are immediately immersed into this world and her story. This book picks up a couple months after the first and draws you deeper into Karla's world. It's written in a epic arch style leaving you wanting to pick up the next book in the series to find out what happens to Karla next. Unfortunately the next book in the series is not out yet. While not a traditional cliff hanger, there are lots of loose ends waiting to be tied up in the next book. Note: I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Since I don't normally write reviews unless I have something specific to say, here's the break down of how I rate my books... 1 star... This book was bad, so bad I may have given up and skipped to the end. I will avoid this author like the plague in the future. 2 stars... This book was not very good, and I won't be reading any more from the author. 3 stars... This book was ok, but I won't go out of my way to read more, But if I find another book by the author for under a dollar I'd pick it up. 4 stars... I really enjoyed this book and will definitely be on the look out to pick up more from the series/author. 5 stars... I loved this book! It has earned a permanent home in my collection and I'll be picking up the rest of the series and other books from the author ASAP. ...more **Copy of book provided by the author in return for an honest review.** DISCLAIMER TO MY FELLOW GOODREADER This review is my personal opinion and may contain: spoilers, quotes, rants, cussing (sometimes I cannot help myself) and a possible full on recap.

He triggered a transformation within her body. Karla was taken from her home and thrust into a world of Shielders and Starkorfs. She also has an internal battle where Misfeata (an Elder) tries to take over her body from within. No big deal. Book 1 ended with Lucas betraying all the Shielders he grew up with. His family never really was killed off either. His blood has the remnants of Tyran (Misfeata's brother who was the first Starkorf). Karla now is on the run with Paul. He is the selfless boy from her old life that seems to want to protect her even if it means his life. Nearly two months have passed since Lucas betrayed the group and Misfeata within Karla fought against Tyran within Lucas's father. Karla is not healing like she should be which has left her weakened and vulnerable. She's on the run with Paul stealing adrenaline from small hospitals since it seems to be the only thing stopping her body from completely shutting down. Karla also has Misfeata's Immortal Blades of Aeisha. A new powerful player has emerged in dangerous world Karla was introduced to. She seems to want both her and Lucas.

Yes this is a big idea for a paranormal fantasy book but I kept seeing this pattern rise throughout this second book and it was nice to see the depth this author has. She is very talented. The main character Karla, finds herself fighting more battles in this installment both internally and externally. Her love life is still complicated and all the while she is trying to make the best decisions for everyone without to much care for herself in a way. Like I said big idea in such a fast paced book.

Magical foes, possession by Elder Immortals, vampire-like baddies... This series has it ALL! I just wish the next book was out already. The ending of this one was not at all satisfying! From beginning to end you will never be disappointed. Kia writes beautifully and gives such amazing depth to everything from characters, places featured in her writing, even emotions. I have to say I am still a Team Ashley supporter but you did manage to make persuade me into liking someone else also. Loved it and really keen to see what happens next. MUST READ YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED ~ Gemma A Xoxo I really felt for Lucas in this book. He was trying to prove that he was trying to help Karla and would protect her, no matter what. Karla has so many struggles to face and again the detail in this book defines each one incredibly! I find myself second guessing Paul in a few spots and still wonder who will Karla really chose? What if Lucas can't protect her forever?! Ah Kia, you torture me waiting for the next two books! This was so suspenseful!!! I enjoyed this book so much. I really liked the first book but this book took me into a new dimension of a world full of wonder and extreme emotion. I don't ever give out spoilers, but I just have to say you see Karla really become a full warrior. It was great...only thing I disliked is that I can't read the 3rd book NOW!!! Loved it!!!

A new enemy, Taskatea, emerges in this book and causes several challenges for the small group making their way to Karla\u2019s parent. A few new character emerge such as Scott, in human form, who provides some comic relief in light of the situation. Paul is expectantly kidnapped by a Taskatea creature and held captive. Karla fights to free him at all costs. During their battles and killing of bizarre beasts Karla learns she kills her father and struggles to adjust to what her life has become. Along the way Karla learns Raven was Taskatea\u2019s only child and is after her for revenge. This twist was unexpected but leads to several intense scenes. The conflict scenes in this book are extraordinary in their detail and you can visualize the scene and feel the need for victory. After setting the stage in book 1 of the series Possession of My Heart does not disappoint. The characters continue to evolve; encounter harder obstacles and further develop of the complicated relationships between main and support characters. By the end of this book I wished it hadn\u2019t ended. There are many unanswered questions that could go in any direction. I again highly recommend this series and eagerly await the next installment.

It was go good. To couldn't put it down, the story and plot just dragged you in until you finished the whole book. The ending though. Amazing. To be honest, there is nothing in the book that I don't like. I can't wait for the next book. I stopped myself from reading the sneak peak so I don't cry over how I have to wait. After the great fight between Tyran & Misfeata, Karlas body is recovering. Misfeata has manipulated & possessed her body. She has to find a cure for herself & try to find her parents.
