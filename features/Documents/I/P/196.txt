I've spent two years avoiding this book. I remember in 2011 when I stumbled across that exciting GR description and pretty - if slightly creepy and discomfiting - cover, but my initial curiosity was quickly dampened by the reviews from my trusted goodreads friends. And for nearly two years, I have listened. My intentions were to never give this book/series another thought, until I recently came across this interesting page: 15 Young Adult Books Every Adult Should Read . And I noticed authors like Laurie Halse Anderson on the list. That's when something inside me rose up to meet the promise of a challenge - plus,<---M> who knows</---M>, sometimes my favourite books of all time have been those I'd taken a chance on against the odds. But this book was just bad . The exciting premise is wasted on a novel that eats at the same lunch table as Twilight , Hush, Hush and Fallen . The mysterious paranormal aspect opens up many avenues for the author to have explored and yet she chooses instead to pick the dullest one - a cliched romance. And damn if this book isn't one huge glowing neon cliche. One where a boring heroine with a severe lack of personality meets a ridiculously good-looking, sexy, British bad boy - who could have anyone he wants - and he somehow finds himself madly in love with her. Why? Well, that remains the biggest mystery of all. Two words come to mind when I think back over this book: wish fulfillment. But yes, the other two words spring to mind a lot too. This novel is a very fine example of a certain brand of book that contains mediocre-at-best writing, unbelievably hot male love interests and is an empty, easy sell for young teen girls. Noah really is quite laughably perfect (if you like controlling jerks, but I'll get to that in a second) with his perfect face, hair, body, smile (etc.), his massive fortune, his intelligence which includes knowledge of six languages and large quotes from various classic novels. He is so flawless, I felt like he'd just rolled off the factory production line, spritzed, polished and raring to go. Ah yes, and about that controlling thing I mentioned. There's really no need to explain it in detail, I'll just pull up some quotes for you: Noah placed his forefinger above my upper lip and his thumb below my bottom lip, and applied the slightest pressure, cutting me off.<---F> \"Shut up,\" he said quietly</---F>. What is Mara's response to his rudeness? I nodded feebly. o_O You nodded... feebly? What is wrong with you? I can't understand why you aren't all like: Then: The waiter appeared then, and Noah plucked the menu from my hands and handed it over, rushing off our order in Spanish. The waiter departed for the kitchen. I shot him a dark look. \"I hadn't decided yet.\" \"Trust me.\" This also happens in Fifty Shades of Grey , Christian orders for Ana without even asking what she'd like or if she's vegetarian or has any allergies. For one thing, it's flawed. But beyond that it's just goddamn rude. What exactly is sexy about a guy not giving a damn what you want? When you look past the pretty description we are given of Noah's perfection, I find him incredibly unattractive, pretentious and annoying. If I wasn't British myself, I think this book would give me a really bad opinion of British people; almost as bad as Lindsay Lohan in The Parent Trap remake when she tells her American twin \"I have claaasss and you don't.\" *shudders* This quote - \"Because I'm European, and therefore more cultured than you\" - might have been funny as an isolated incident but Noah's repetition of similar declarations of cultural superiority (with books, music, etc.) just made me think... I also think Mara is in desperate need of a new girlfriend because the girls in this book are ALL her enemies. Even her two friends at the beginning get separated into best friend and evil girl who's trying to steal best friend away. The word \"slut\" naturally appears several times in this novel and usually when the characters are talking about mean girl Anna who immediately decided to make Mara's life hell because Noah showed some interest in her. This beautiful quote sums up Anna's characterisation: \"The list of what you're missing, Anna, is longer than the South Beach Free Clinic's walk-in list,\" Jamie said, and I was surprised to hear his voice. \"Though I'm sure your hookup resume includes the same names.\" Cue group laughter as good triumphs over the evil slut who doesn't deserve feelings. This always amazes me in these kind of books - that we're supposed to be sympathetic towards the MC and believe she is the victim and much more interesting because of her lack of sluttiness. I don't think I'll ever understand why that stuff matters. I've been picking out all these quotes throughout this review but I've saved the best for last. If I had been drinking whilst reading this bit, I would have sprayed the contents of my mouth everywhere. I just... can't. This is in response to Mara finding out about how Noah slept with a girl who was in love with him just to prove a point to the girl's brother: I should haul back and smack him, strike a blow for feminism or something or at the very least, get out of the car. But then his thumb traced my skin and without quite realizing it, I leaned toward him and rested my forehead against his. ... to hell with feminism! Hot jerk is touching my face!! ...more Well, let me get this out of the way - The Unbecoming of <---C>Mara Dyer</---C> has nothing whatsoever in common with The Adoration of Jenna Fox , even though their publisher-provided plot descriptions are almost identical.

What it is similar to is the infamous bestseller Hush, Hush , but it is just a tad less offensive. So, if you are a fan of that novel, The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer is your next natural reading choice. I'll attempt to refrain from excessive ranting here, but, goodness, this novel is just as bad (or as good, depending on how you look at it) as Hush, Hush . First, there is this wonky, messy and too often nonsensical paranormal story line that is, naturally, all but abandoned to concentrate on romance later in the book. Mara wakes up from a coma to find out that her 3 friends have died in an accident which she miraculously survived. She doesn't remember the circumstances of it, but something strange starts happening to her. She seems to be seeing ghosts everywhere, people around her are dying, she keeps losing chunks of time. Things are so bad with Mara, that her parents consider sending her to an asylum for psychiatric treatment. But eventually they all settle on helping her deal with the trauma by moving to Florida. Here during her first disastrous day in a new private school Mara meets, you guessed it, a scorching hot bad boy named Noah Shaw. Of course, he's been around the block and allegedly dated every girl in the school. Of course, he is loaded. Of course, Mara is the first girl he ever cared about, cared enough to announce her his girlfriend and, oh my, drive her to school! Where have I seen this before? What follows is exactly what you'd expect, a \"romance\" that is pretty much an exercise in sexual innuendo, douchebaggery and you-are-mine/i-belong-to-you mumbo-jumbo. I got sick of the constant alluding to \"nailing\" or \"knowing what I put in my mouth before swallowing\" very quickly. To be fair, unlike Nora, Mara does not just quietly take suggestive and offensive remarks thrown at her, she can return them as well - the \"swallowing\" line is hers. Plus, Noah doesn't try to kill her. I suppose some female readers will find this sort of dating attractive, amusing, hot even, but for the life of me I can't work up any love for the male lead who is described by Mara's new best friend as a guy who uses and discards his girlfriends \"like condoms\" (allegedly). What else is there to expect? In a Becca Fitzpatrick -like fashion, <---A>Michelle Hodkin</---A> fills her book with nonsensical things like a teacher (in a posh private school!) throwing stuff and insults at her students, or fortuitous situations where our lovebirds find themselves in various beds with no adults around (of course, there are super-duper paranormal reasons why the two can't go all the way ), or one-dimensional characters - Mara's blonde mean girl arch-nemesis who turned a complete slut after dating our hero and an obligatory best new black Jewish bi friend (much better and more inventive than that obligatory best gay friend, right?) Pardon me while I go roll my eyes at this mess some more. P.S. I dare you to explain what exactly happened in this book. ...more 1.5 stars Welcome to yet another teen romance masquerading as a paranormal novel. If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve been salivating to read this book for months because of the breathtaking cover\u2014and of course, the premise of a girl waking up in a hospital with no memory of how her friends were killed is pretty intriguing.

If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve been salivating to read this book for months because of the breathtaking cover\u2014and of course, the premise of a girl waking up in a hospital with no memory of how her friends were killed is pretty intriguing. I\u2019m sorry to say, however, that the maddening phenomenon I\u2019m calling \u201ccover fraud\u201d strikes again, since this is another book whose interior does not live up to its beautiful cover art. Mara Dyer doesn\u2019t know what happened to her friends the day that a building collapsed on them, nor how she somehow escaped miraculously unscathed. The family decides to pack up and move to another town to get away from intrusive attention and so that her lawyer father can take on a high-profile criminal case. Until this point, things are pretty interesting and I wanted to know what was going on just as much as Mara did. Except suddenly, a boy enters the picture, and Mara pretty much loses all common sense interest in figuring out why people around her keep dying. And that\u2019s when I lost my interest in this book, too. I rarely have trouble adjusting any preconceived expectations about a book\u2019s content, which is why I\u2019m able to go with the flow for books such as Divergent or Delirium , which weren\u2019t quite what I expected but I liked because the authors handled certain aspects of them very well. So if this was going to turn out to be a romance book with the paranormal stuff thrown in as a bonus, well, I\u2019d be fine with it if I was sufficiently entertained. The issue with this is that if the book isn't entertaining and the romance doesn\u2019t work for you, the whole thing is doomed. And this romance did not work for me at all. Noah Shaw is one of those guys you\u2019re supposed to find charming in spite of yourself. He\u2019s arrogant, he\u2019s got a smart mouth, he has a \u201cdeviant grin,\u201d and he\u2019s slept with just about every girl he\u2019s ever looked at. As soon as Mara sees him, she seems to be struck dumb (view spoiler) [hee hee hee, \u201cstruck dumb\u201d (hide spoiler) ] by his appeal, even if she pretends to hate him. Noah pushes the boundary of being a jerk a little too often for my comfort, however, and it isn\u2019t until later in the book that we find out whether or not he\u2019s actually a good guy. The problem really isn\u2019t Noah, though; it\u2019s Mara. While Mara is admittedly not a completely spineless, annoying heroine, she is incredibly obsessed with Noah, to the point where you\u2019re embarrassed for her. Look, we all notice every single minute detail when we\u2019re into a guy, right? But there\u2019s also family and work and hopes and dreams to think about, and certainly if there are people dropping like flies, you\u2019d think a girl would spend a little more time worrying about that instead of mooning over \u201cthe slender muscles in his arms.\u201d (Mara really doesn\u2019t seem to do anything outside of school and her only friend is a very politically correct bisexual black Jewish guy who pretty much functions as a Greek chorus.) The fact that there is so much attention paid to the way Noah looks and what Noah says is pretty sad\u2014and honestly, although he has a few moments where I bordered on liking him, it never really happened. Plus he\u2019s just not that hot. The amount of wish fulfillment running through this book is also completely out of control. Noah has a British accent, speaks six languages, and mentions his parents\u2019 \u201cla vie boheme\u201d lifestyle. He lives in a palatial house with a valet, a \u201cGreek-inspired fountain,\u201d a \u201cflawless patterned marble floor,\u201d \u201cplush Oriental rugs,\u201d and oil paintings, and his \u201cstartling\u201d room has enormous windows overlooking the bay and bookcases that reach all the way up to the ceiling. He reads to her from E.M. Forster, he\u2019s possessive and tells a random guy named Alain off in French , and he wants Mara even though he could have anyone. Although of course, he never slept with the one mean girl who keeps tormenting Mara. And despite his ludicrous wealth--he literally peels $5000 off from a wad in his pocket at one point--he drives a Prius. There are also the clich\u00e9s of a tony private school, a prerequisite dance to which Mara wears a \u201cdark emerald green silk dress\u201d that dips \u201cdangerously low in the back\u201d and someone literally goes \u201cOHmigod!\u201d when he sees her, a ridiculous scene in which Mara tells off a cartoonishly unpleasant teacher, and an eye-rolling occasion when Noah crashes her art class and takes off his shirt so that all the drooling girls can sketch him. The more I think about it, the more this reads like the script for a CW television show. And also, what was with (view spoiler) [the prologue? The end of the book doesn't loop events back to that point at all. (hide spoiler) ] Oh, back to the dead people thing. There are some flashbacks to the day of the accident and more people die, but it\u2019s all done with so little interest past the first quarter of the book that it\u2019s really difficult to stay invested in the story, particularly when random events involving alligators, dog rescues, a seminar, a kidnapping, and her father\u2019s court case are so haphazardly strung together. I guessed what the big secret was before I\u2019d even read the first page (view spoiler) [hint: there\u2019s a big clue in her name (hide spoiler) ] , so it was an exercise in frustration to watch all the clunky pieces strain desperately to fit together into a cohesive whole. Aside from the flat characters, uneven writing, and loose plotting, what turns me off so much about this story is that it\u2019s all so shallow and all so meaningless. (view spoiler) [The fact that Mara\u2019s temper is causing all of this but she doesn\u2019t feel the appropriate amount of guilt really ticks me off. Her reactions are completely disproportionate to the sins committed against her. (hide spoiler) ] I read a lot of fluff books for sheer entertainment, but there\u2019s got to be something in them that I like\u2014and sadly, the best things about this book are the cover and the premise. Like Elizabeth Miles\u2019 Fury , it\u2019s another beautifully packaged book (view spoiler) [loosely based on a myth (hide spoiler) ] which is much more interested in indulging in superficial relationships than anything else. I hesitate to weigh in this next bit as part of my rating because this is mostly a personal preference, but reviews are inherently subjective by nature, no? So I\u2019ll go ahead and say that while I think Fury was technically the more tasteless book in terms detailing the dirty things that teenagers can get up to, there\u2019s something about Mara Dyer that is much uglier to me. The fact that this girl is so obsessed with a boy is so wrong to begin with, but what really made me realize how much I disliked this book was the point when Noah starts jokingly quoting from The Velveteen Rabbit and Dr. Seuss and inserting fellatio jokes. I think most of my friends here know by my reading material that I\u2019m pretty laid back and am not one to get worked up over the choices that fictional characters make that would not be my own. But I do believe strongly in the sanctity of childhood and feel a great deal of responsibility in doing my part in helping to protect that. While I know it\u2019s all supposed to be funny and to show how clever and charming Noah is, I just find that sort of thing incredibly distasteful. But in the end, I know there are many readers who will find this book a lot more appealing than I do. I don\u2019t even blame anyone who still wants to check it out, because, well, look at that cover! How could it possibly be disappointing? All I can say is that I personally came away from this reading experience with an extremely bad taste in my mouth. It probably wasn\u2019t helped by the fact that I\u2019d recently read so many fantastic books that were not only entertaining, but were also beautiful and moving and actually contributed something meaningful to literature. The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer may very well end up being a popular book for now, but it will never end up being one that stands the test of time. What\u2019s most disappointing is that it doesn\u2019t even try to be. This review also appears in The Midnight Garden . ...more Hmm...Where do I even start with this book?

I guess I should start by saying The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer and I have this awkward love/hate relationship. If this book were a person, it'd be the boyfriend I sometimes had fun with, but never wanted to take with me in public because I knew he would do something stupid and embarrass the hell outta me. For majority of the first half of the book, I wanted to stomp it into the ground with my pair of patent leather pumps. However, somewhere along the lines, I started to enjoy myself a bit. I'd hear a strange sounds coming from my mouth only to realize, \"Oh my, that was a chuckle .\" In many ways, I can really see why so many people would really like this book, but I can also see why others would want to gorge their eyes out with a high school cafeteria spork. Mara Dyer wakes up in a hospital bed one day with no recollection of how she got there or what happened to her friends who were killed in the accident that she managed to survive. Hoping for a new beginning, her family packs up and moves to Florida. As the memories Mara thought were lost start to slowly make a reappearance and dead bodies seem to pop up like daisies, she notices something is not quite right with her. She, then, struggles to keep hold of reality while trying to figure out the mystery of what really happened to her in her old hometown. The Good: I'll start with the good first since there are a few things I did like and I have so much more \"bad\" to rant about later in the review .The cover is beautiful! It has to be one of my favorite covers of the year and I get shivers just looking at it. Not only that, but the book's premise really appealed to me and is easily the biggest reason why I continued to turn page after page. It was a surprisingly quick and easy read and the writing style wasn't bad either. I really appreciated that both of Mara's parents were around, even though they seemed to dissapear at the most convenient of times. And like I said earlier some of the dialog I did enjoy and found funny. Most of the best moments for this book is between Mara and Noah, the love interest. ...okaaayyy so that's all I got for the good. Man, that's a bit pathetic. It's barely a paragraph. The Bad: This book had a lot of potential and for the longest time, I couldn't exactly put my finger on what bothered me about the book. If it weren't for the following issues, this could have been a 4 star read for me, possibly more. The books biggest issues are the actual characters and all the sterotypes that come along with them. They were completely extra . The gay black guy, the extra bitchy popular girl who hates the MC for some vain, insignificant reason accompanied by tweedle dumb (her trusty side kick or fashion accessory. I can't decide which.), the bad boy who truly isn't bad (he has feelings, he's deep and likes to \"fix\" people), and the obnoxious, perfect, older brother. 1. Jamie. Jamie is Mara's new best friend in Florida. He also happens to be a bisexual, Jewish, Black male with dreadlocks and a tongue ring. Oh, and he's adopted. Yes, I know. He is quite a little token cocktail, isn't he? Hodkin, you want to put a PoC or a bisexual or a Jewish person in your story? Be my guest. But, why, oh why, did he have to be all THREE AT ONCE? And if he wasn't \"Black enough\" let's give him dreads. And, oh noz, he isn't \"gay enough\" either, we must add a tongue ring! And what the hell, let's urbanize him while we are at it. Funny thing is he knows he's the token character: \u201cBut none of this matters, because you\u2019re not going to listen to your token black Jewish bi friend, are you?\u201d That is the part where Hodkin almost owed me a new Kindle. I literally had to stop reading or I was going to lose it. His characterization was poor, poor, poor. It felt like he was trying entirely too hard to be both gay and Black, neither of which I found convincing. About halfway through the book we don't see him again and I couldn't even be mad at that because I was too busy celebrating the fact I no longer had to endure his weird hip-hop lingo anymore. I realize this may have been Hodkin's attempt to add diversity to her story, but guess what? 2. Daniel. Or as I liked to call him: The kiss-ass perfectionist. He was just too over the top to be believable. He is perfect in every way: Perfect student, perfect son, perfect brother. I can totally see why Mara was annoyed by this. Every time Mara wants to go somewhere, Daniel has to first talk with their mother about it. AND IT ALWAYS WORKS. I have an issue when one sibling seems to hold that much power in a hosehold. There is a scene in the book where he is looking at the mail and says \u201cWhat lucky institution of higher education accepted me today?\u201d he asked, eyes on the envelopes. \u201cAh, Harvard. That\u2019s nice. And Stanford!\u201d Wow, so not only is he a kiss ass, but he's conceded too! If I ever saw Daniel out in public with his mom, it would go something like this: I would to tap him on the shoulder and go, \"Hey, buddy. You dropped something.\" \"Huh? What? Where?\" he'd say. And I would respond, \"Your lips. I see them over there dangling off your momma's right ass cheek. Go and get 'em, will ya? It's distracting.\" 3. Noah Noah is the bad boy love interest of the story that has had sex with the entire female population of the school. >insert eye roll here< His character is also over the top with bad boy stereotypes. He gets away with everything because everyone loves him. He is loaded with cash money. He's ridiculously good looking with a *le gasp* English accent. He's incredibly arrogant, rude and tactless. Oh, and most importantly, he only has eyes for Mara. Of course. Once he enters the picture, Mara completely forgets about everything. *cough*the plot*cough* I suppose it really isn't her fault. After all, Noah possesses a \"panty-dropping smile.\" Hide your daughters! Later in the story, a small piece of me actually started to like him, but unlike Mara, I couldn't excuse his original jackassness. Nope, couldn't do it. 4. Mara (What is your real name anyway?) I didn't entirely dislike her, but I felt she made some really crappy decisions. This story could have really taken off and gone to an interesting place if she didn't become so obsessed with Noah. There were times where I thought she would use that crazy brain of hers, but then she would turn right around and ignore the problem. There was one scene when Jamie tells her (view spoiler) [ that Noah caught him with his hand up Noah's little sister's skirt and Noah runs off and has sex with Jamie's older sister as revenge. (hide spoiler) ] When she actually talks to Noah about it, he admits it and what does she do? She just changes the subject and they never talk about it again. Then, there are times when Mara's logical skills seem to fail her all together. What could I say? Noah, despite you being an asshole, or maybe because of it, I\u2019d like to rip off your clothes and have your babies. Don\u2019t tell. Oh, yeah, Mara. That makes total sense. Or how about when you and Noah are in his room about to kiss, but you decide you don't want to kiss him (view spoiler) [because the last time you did, he almost died. (I'm still not clear if this was one of her hallucinations or not.) (hide spoiler) ] Yet, you think having sex instead would be safer? Because of situations like this, I just could not connect with Mara at all. I suppose I was supposed to feel sorry for her when her teacher threw chalk at her and made fun of her in front of the entire class. Sorry, Mara. Then the teacher gave her an 'F' for showing her up on her oral exam. She told you to sit your ass down, Mara. That means do not pass go. Do not collect your $200. It means STFO. And you wondered why you got a failing grade. Then you went off, (view spoiler) [killed her (hide spoiler) ] , and had a psychotic break down and lost two hours of your life. Was I supposed to care then too? 5. The Plot I think The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer ran into the same issue Incarnate did. It got so wrapped up in the romance; it completely discarded the premise of the book. When something exciting actually started happening it completely came out of left field and hit Mara in the head. I was really disappointed that we really didn't find out more about Mara's abilities. The explanation given by the end of the book was easy to guess and I was expecting more answers. And I read somewhere that this book is supposed to scare you. Lies. All lies 6. The Ending Damn that cliffhanger. I actually finished reading the book and I'm rewarded with the worst cliffhanger possible. I started screaming at my poor Kindle Touch (which is awesome, by the way. Thanks for asking. :D). WTF, dude! Okay, I have to stop naming things that irked me or I'll start sharp shooting a star off this review. I'll read the next book, but along with Incarnate 's sequel, it's going right on my \"You're on probation\" shelf. Oh, and riddle me this: How is this book considered paranormal? You go the entire book with alomst nothing supernatural until the very end and suddenly it's paranormal? That's just lazy. Okay, I'm really done this time.

It comes out during unexpected moments and always takes the reader by surprise. There isn\u2019t much of it, but the reader is constantly on the edge of his seat, because he knows it will appear at some point. Mara Dyer is a snarky, if not judgmental and headstrong, heroine. But she has a soft side. Noah on the other side is calm and seems to have an answer to everything. He and Mara are two strong characters and, though I hate to admit it because the romance irked me most of the time, they do make a perfect match. It\u2019s definitely a character-driven story. The plot is there, and honestly I always wanted to know what would happen, but there is not much description. Characters rule the story, not the world-building or details or anything else. They make the intrigue. Without them, the story would have no meaning. There are some things I would change about it, if given the chance to: I\u2019d cut on the romance, the unnecessary blah blah and drama \u2013 hell, that Spanish teacher is a demon \u2013 and I\u2019d pour more horror scenes and craziness inside it.

I rate my books one-star to \u201cThe Unbecoming of Mara Dyer.\u201d People always want to know what my absolute hands-down favorite book is. And it\u2019s funny because when they ask, they always give me that good minute-long silence for me to think it over. But I never need a minute. And I probably never will. This is my favorite book. This book is my trump card whenever my friends and I are talking about the most amazing books ever written during those 3 a.m. conversations; it\u2019s the book that I\u2019ve read 14 times ; it\u2019s the only book that I have that\u2019s completely covered in margin notes. \u2666 It\u2019s the book that made me a book snob. \u2666 Mara wakes up in a hospital, only to find out that her friends are dead from having an entire building collapse upon them. And her only clue as to how that happened is that she was the only one that lived. After burying her friends and her former life, Mara\u2019s family moves her away, thinking that all she needs is to start over. \u2666New state. New town.\u2666 \u2666New school. New friends.\u2666 \u2666New life. And Noah Shaw. \u201cHave you kissed many boys before?\u201d he asked quietly. I raised an eyebrow. \u201cBoys? That\u2019s an assumption.\u201d Noah laughed, the sound low and husky. \u201cGirls, then?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cNot many girls? Or not many boys?\u201d \u201cNeither,\u201d I said. Let him make of that what he would. \u201cHow many?\u201d \u201cWhy\u2014\u201c \u201cI am taking away that word. You are no longer allowed to use it. How many?\u201d My cheeks flushed, but my voice was steady as I answered. \u201cOne.\u201d At this, Noah leaned impossible closer, the slender muscles in his forearm flexing as he bent his elbow to bring himself nearer to me, almost touching. I was heady with the proximity of him an grew legitimately concerned that my heart might explode. Maybe Noah wasn\u2019t asking. Maybe I didn\u2019t\u2019 mind. I closed my eyes and felt Noah\u2019s five o\u2019clock graze my jaw, and the faintest whisper of his lips at my ear. \u201cHe was doing it wrong.\u201d Noah\u2019s the only one that believes Mara when she tells him that she\u2019s going crazy. When she tells him that she can kill people with the gun of her mind and the trigger of her imagination. \u2666Is it real? Or not?\u2666 \u201cFix me,\u201d I commanded him. \u201cThis thing what I\u2019ve done\u2014there\u2019s something wrong with me, Noah. Fix it.\u201d Noah\u2019s expression broke my heart as he brushed my hair from my face, and skimmed the line of my neck. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d \u2666This book is suspenseful and intriguing and riveting and it has a page 359 that\u2019ll make you stop breathing.\u2666 \u201dI don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d I told him. \u201cYou always have choice.\u201d He said. ...more \u201cBut without my big mouth, no one would know that a seventeen-year-old who likes Death Cub for Cutie was responsible for the murders.

No one would know that somewhere out there is a B student with a body count. And it's important that you know, so you're not next.\u201d This book messed with my sanity. It teased it, played with it and then tossed it aside and left me trying to gather my wits, something that felt like catching feathers in a tornado. Impossible. I was very hesitant to start this book. I was convinced it would be nothing special and I wouldn't like it. You can imagine my surprise when I felt hooked to this story since page 1. Page 1. That's all it took to dive in a unique reading experience that almost sent me straight to the asylum. (pun intended) \u201cThinking something does not make it true. Wanting something does not make it real.\u201d There's not much I can say about the plot without spoiling you except that it follows the story of Mara Dyer, a girl whose best friend was killed when they were together and couldn't remember anything about it. She was traumatized, she couldn't put it behind her despite her family's efforts and love, she saw ghosts and things no one else could, and she was certain she was going crazy. And then she met Noah Shaw and everything changed. \u201cAnd just like that, I was completely, utterly, and entirely, His.\u201d What makes The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer a unique reading experience - The mystery. The mystery is tangible and gives you the creeps. There was something utterly disturbing sinking in my skin, giving me goosebumps and making my heart race. You needed answers but you didn't get them. All you got was more questions and a sense of foreboding. And a brain smelling like roast potatoes. - The paranormal element. Dead people making appearances, portraits looking at you, bugs at your food, horrible deaths etc etc. I will not be able to look at my bathtub the same way again. - The humor. \u201cOne little joke involving hemorrhagic fever and they brand you 'unstable'.\u201d As you can imagine some light moments were essential to make you breathe, and Michelle Hodkin knew exactly how to make you laugh (or giggle maniacally, depends on the person-not that it happened to me.) - Noah Shaw. \u201cWhat could I say? Noah, despite you being an asshole, or maybe because of it, I'd like to rip off your clothes and have your babies.\u201d Hot. Arrogant. British. Owns a massive book collection. Loves dogs. Pant-dropping smile. Sensitive. Extremely and unexpectedly sweet. Hot. I loved his scenes with Mara, the way he refused to give up on her and supported her. He can be the one to save her from the darkness or doom her to a life deprived of light. What say you? Care to give it a try?

Also, because I can't be fucked to individually tag every single spoiler in this review, I'm just gonna say that if you don't wished to be maaajorly spoiled then DON'T read this review. So let's get into this. Let me just start by sighing the biggest most exasperated and tired sigh on the entire planet earth. Now we can move on. There is a lot, and by a lot I mean A FRIGGIN SHIT TON wrong with Mara Dyer. But let's start with the basics first. Fucking. Jamie. Okay, look, I know what you're probably thinking. \"OMG! Mello/Italy is always bitching about minorities not being portrayed enough and when there is a minority in a book she bitches anyway! Instead of whining she should just take what she's got! She never shuts up about anything!\" To which I'm thinking, And I will get into why I'm thinking that. I'd like to think I'm less violent than that, but you never know. So you better pay attention! I have a lot of literary arch nemises...nemisises...neme -- enemies. Literary arch enemies. That list of arch enemies now includes Jamie whatever-the-fuck-his-last-name-is-because-I-can't-be-arsed-to-check. Firstly, he is a douchebag. Here are some quotes from our lovely lovely James: Quote: \"Anna used to be the abstinence poster girl, but post-[Noah], you could write a comic book about the many adventures of her vagina. It could wear a cape.\u201d (view spoiler) [ This one really grates on me. (hide spoiler) ] Why he's a douchebag: I don't know about you, but I'm smelling some slut shamingggg . This entire comment is sleazy. What the fuck does her sex life have to do with him, anyway? Oh, that's right, NOTHING. And why does the entire situation mentioned warrant ridicule? If anything, it's showing how broken up she was over Noah fucking with her and warrants sympathy , which is exactly what I feel for her over the course of the novel. Quote: \"(...)Take Anna, for example. She\u2019s only a few IQ points above a corpse, and yet she sullies our Algebra II class with her stupidity.\u201d Why he's a douchebag: Okay, first of all asshole, you haven't seen her grades. You haven't talked to her for over five minutes. Outside of your quick judgements and Anna being a jealous jerk towards Mara you seem to know nothing about her. So kindly SHUT UP about her IQ points, which are clearly soaring above any you may have, may being emphasized here. Quote: \u201cNoah doesn\u2019t date. He\u2019ll screw you\u2014literally and figuratively. Everyone knows it\u2014his conquests know it\u2014but they pretend not to care until he moves on to the next one. And then they\u2019re alone and their reputations are shot to hell.I heard that a senior from Walden tried to commit suicide after he\u2014well. After he got what he came for, pun intended, and didn\u2019t call again.\" Why he's a douchebag: How Noah's flings in this novel are treated in general is really fucked up, but I'll get into that later. This comment, however, greatly enrages me. It fucking comes to the point where a girl is so miserable over Noah using her for sex that she tries to kill herself, and Jamie makes a fucking pun about it? What the fuck? Considering that his own fucking sister was one of these girls YOU WOULD THINK THE ASSHOLE WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE SENSITIVE, BUT NO. And all of this is just the tip of the assholish iceberg. Jamie likens Noah's exes to used condoms, constantly refers to \"getting vagina\" or (I cringe in agony, pain, misery and sorrow as I type these words, mind you) \"getting pussy\" as if it's some kind of goddamn sport , as if having sex with girls is like, oh, throwing a motherfucking football! AND I SWORE TO MYSELF THAT WHEN I BEGAN THIS REVIEW I WOULD NOT SWEAR AS HEAVILY AS I HAVE BEFORE, BUT JAMIE IS MAKING ME SWEAR. FUCK. And why does all of this make you an idiot? Because, you, dear moron, think that I should have to put up with this bitch as representing minorities. Jamie's black, Jewish and bi and a self admitting token to the novel. I do not want Jamie or any of his asshole caliber representing me or any other normal human being on this planet. SO YEAH. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE AN IDIOT. I WILL NOT SETTLE FOR THIS. I want more minorities in YA. But I don't want any more sexist, stereotypical fuckwads that happen to be minorities in YA. We already have enough of those, don't you think? WELL? DON'T YOU? ANSWER ME, DAMN YOU! ...before I get even more psychotic over this, let's move on! Another thing I had a problem with. The Treatment of Anna Okay, I know, you're probably thinking: \"But! But! But Mello/Italy! Anna is the mean girl; she deserves everything she gets! She's a bitch to Mara! And she's a bitch to Mara only because she's jealous! Why are you defending her?!\" First of all, Anna is only a mean girl because Mara Dyer is an especially uncreative book in terms of characters. Second of all, no, she is not actually a real mean girl. I hate to say it, but Anna is pathetic as a mean girl. She never does anything actually mean to Mara besides calling her a slut for getting with Noah (which all of the main characters pretty much do to her, not saying that it's right) and taking her sketch book and making fun of her drawings. And not \"OMG YOU SUCK THIS IS AWFUL\" making fun of, either. For a supposed mean girl she's actually quite tame. On the outside, Anna is your blonde jealous slut who's mean to the main character. But on the inside? She's actually a lost, angry girl who's ridiculed behind her back for being in love with and not being able to get over Noah. And because of this she often outlashes at other people, which is kind of understandable, considering. Yeah, yeah, I know it sounds crazy, but you know what? It isn't. For instance, Anna's mistreatment shows through when Mara says, \u201cHaving everyone stare and wonder what sort of hijinks your vagina\u2019s been up to isn\u2019t as thrilling as one might imagine.\u201d to Noah after rumors of them (Mara and Noah) being together start floating around the school. But didn't I just quote Jamie as making fun of Anna using exactly that phrasing ? \"It could wear a cape,\" is what Jamie said. And yet, despite Mara's apparent discontent about her own sex life being made fun of constantly, she apparently sees no issue that her own best friend does it to someone else. That's hypocrisy, and it's also fucked up. (Jamie never gets called out for saying that shit, either.) So, yeah, that's why I like and can easily defend Anna. And ANOTHER thing, How Noah's ex-girlfriends are treated This is especially fucked up. Like, more than everything is in the novel is fucked up, even. And that's just shocking. I will get more into Noah later, but right now, basically, all you need to know is that he's supposed to be really \"slutty\". (I use the quotes because I really don't believe in calling people sluts.) And a huge dick. (I don't use quotes because I have no problem with calling people dicks.) So, he's also a heartbreaker. And I mean severe heartbreaker. Serial heartbreaker. As in, makes girls feel special and then drops them, later talking about them like they're nothing (in case of what he does to Anna). One girl had it so bad, as I quoted Jamie saying above, that she even tried to commit suicide. I, unlike the characters in this novel, actually have a problem with this. I'm sorry, but you can not just use people like that. Jamie says that Noah will \"screw with you, literally and figuratively\" and that is not okay and not mysterious and not hot . That is fucked up and that is wrong. But is Noah ever held at fault for this? Actually, fucking no. And are the girls he flung aside ever given any sympathy for, or treated as real people who actually got hurt? Actually, fucking no. And that makes me angry. So angry I could turn into a pink haired anime girl and friggin slap the shit out of someone! But, really, that's fucked up. Over the course of the novel these girls are likened and referred to as, with not a single fucking hint of sympathy, as many awful things I don't really want to mention, but to give you the gist of the fuckery, one of those things being used condoms . And that is NOT okay. Look, before anyone thinks I'm just all pissy over this because obviously I've had something like this happen to me before and I'm totes just too sensitive, let me let you in on a little tiny secret: YOU'RE WRONG. It's just that, you know, I just happen to take a little offense for people that have actually been hurt that way, because as a fucking human being with the smallest emphasizing capabilities I ACTUALLY SEEM TO CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE, YOU KNOW. I DO THIS ALL THE TIME. SHOCKING, I KNOW, SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A MOMENT FOR THIS SHIT TO SINK IN. ... ... ... Are you okay now? Good. We can move on again, because I think I've flipped my shit enough talked enough about this subject. Noah himself The sexy, rich, British, \"slutty\" high school boy. Girls are supposed to go: However, this is how I feel about his \"smexyness\": (A look of mild amusement and disgust.) First of all, I friggin hate that entire stereotype. By the way, this novel is filled with stereotypes, in case you didn't notice. There isn't anything sexy about Noah. Perhaps that's just because I'm weird. Perhaps because what I find sexy in a person is nerdiness, modest yet cool, awkwarness (like me), kindness and nice teeth. (And, you know, of course they're going to have to be kind of cute too but I'm not too picky.) Noah is none of these things. He's arrogant, pushy, fake suave (I say that because his suave isn't even real suave, it's the fake contrived suave) and he reminds me of James Potter without the Marauders, Snape or Lily. Trust me when I say that this is not a good thing. And look at my James Potter essay if you don't believe me. Frankly, I don't like Noah or James Potter or that stereotype because, well, I don't like dicks. Okay So. That came out sounding... Shut up. I know you're laughing at me right now, so shut up. .... anyway , if you'd all get your mind out of the gutter for a moment to listen to me bitch some more, the point is that Noah isn't any of the things the book, or more to say Mara, tries to make him out to be. And what is it with the British accent fetish? I hate to say it, but British accents aren't very sexy. (Don't kill me for this, I'm just sayin' .) Seriously, they aren't. Nor are Irish accent. NOR IS ANY ACCENT. No accent is automatically going to boost your character's smexeh factor. /end accent rant AND ANOTHER THING... The shocking blandness of the whole thing. Mara and Noah's relationship...the whole thing with her and Noah's powers (which, no, I still don't understand)...THE WHOLE PLOT... I was basically like: Me: Hey, book, book! Is this the part where I care? can I give a fuck yet? Oh, please, please, please? Book: Me: ....okay.... I WAS BORED OUT OF MY MIND. Mara didn't even get a clue about all the paranormal stuff that was supposed to happen but didn't until, like 80-90% into the fucking book, until, like, 80-90% into the book. It was infuriating, especially when she had the nerve to make comments like: \"Something is happening to me.\" And you're like: \"WELL NO DUH, YOU IDIOT.\" The worst part is that inbetween when the book starts and the part when you actually do start to give a fuck (never, by the way) the book \"appeases\" you by giving you Noah and Mara as a couple to swoon over. Here's the kicker: THEY ONLY MAKE EVERYTHING MORE BORING. And to make things more interesting beyond that (zero) Mara constantly reminds us of her visions and nightmares and of how crazy she is. Guess what, Mara, after a certain point... I know I sure as fuck didn't. There was one part, where we figured out why that asylum collapsed on her and her friends, the part with Jude, where I almost gave a fuck. Almost. But then, no, I didn't, and why? Because we were flashed again to another lovely snippet of Noah and Mara's relationship. That cancelled out all the fucks I could ever give. [image error] What else is there...? MARA THE SUE I'm sorry, but I just could not like Mara. Inbetween her Bella Swan like thinking (being mad at her brother and boyfriend for trying to get her something for her birthday), swooning over the guy that's obviously bad news (Noah, in case everything I've written above couldn't hammer the point into your skull enough), being generally unbadass and boring (I literally considered just putting the book down when I was almost two thirds of the way through. It was that boring.) and me actually putting down the book for a day or so to read Homestuck (a webcomic) and marvel over an awesome female character there -- no. Just no. I can't. it's just against my morals. She's even one of those psuedo-geniuses that so often appear in YA novels, yet it's never actually shown with her actions that she is in fact smart. As I'm embarrassed to admit, I even turned to scrolling through fanfiction if, only for a moment, to escape her annoying, borderline-sueish and boring ways. All I can say for this book is that at least there's no purple prose. Now to finally end this criminally long review... \"But Mello/Italy! Isn't there anything good you can say about this book?\" Yes. Like I stated above, there isn't any of the awful prose that marks an especially bad PNR. (Although there are some questionable moments...) Also, underneath all of the ick, it does have it's clever moments that made me lol. But, however, despite this, I can not excuse everything else I've witnessed while reading this novel. Look, Michelle Hodkin, if you're reading this (and I have heard that authors do indeed stalk their reviews) I am not saying you're a bad person or that you think this way. I'm just saying what I've seen in your novel, alright? I know the gifs make me look mean, and the swearing makes me look cruel, and my tone makes me look really arrogant, but whatever. You're probably a really nice person. I don't know. I just hate your book. Sorry about that. I've just finished a full length novel, alright? So I know how hard it is. Even though I'm in the editing process I know I'm not even half done yet and sometimes it makes me want to scream. But, you know what? That has nothing to do with how bad this book is. Sure, it doesn't even touch the surface of atrocities like Hush Hush and Halo/Hades (DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED, PLEASE) but it's still bad and there isn't really an excuse for that. Maybe I'm being mean. Probably. Maybe I'd be upset if I read the same things about my own novel. Surely. But does that mean I wouldn't want people to tell me the truth about what I've written, even if it hurts me? Well, to be honest, yes. But, to be really really honest, no. I remember my lurking days of GR, searching each book for a review that would tell me everything I wanted to know about a book so I could make up my mind over reading it or not. Sorry to say, but I write these kind of reviews for that me. If it's cruel, or whatever, sorry, but I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. It's not like I'm a cruel bitch who can't respect other people's feelings. It's that I'm a cruel bitch who doesn't like to be told what she can and can not say. Sorry if that bothers you. *wonders how she got on soapbox without realizing it* *steps off of soapbox* Anyway. So, I think I've basically told you all I can about the Unbecoming of Mara Dyer. Hm. Wow. This turned out a lot more angry and antagonistic than I ever intended it to be.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more SPOILER FREE REVIEW: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fQpa...

The profound, prolific, and purely dramatic prologue. *lights dim and a single spotlight focuses on me; a narrator's voice comes out of the loudspeakers* Cait doesn't think The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer can get any more terrible than reading Twilight and having no memory how she read that without imploding. It can. She believes that there must be more to this book with the beautiful cover that left her friends squealing and biting their nails in anticipation and left her mysteriously excited. There isn't. She doesn't believe that after everything she's read about this book, she can't not instantly fall in love with it. She's wrong. The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer is everything I hoped it wouldn't be, and even more. Not the good kind of more, but the oh-dear-God-please-no-make-it-stop-I-can't-take-this-anymore- kind of no. Now having said that, though, I really can understand how some people would like this book; the writing is fine and there are actually some good quotes like: I twisted my arm to curl him behind me and he unfolded there, the two of us snuggled like quotation marks in his room full of words. Mara does have some pretty good quips and comments especially at the beginning of this book; I actually did gigglesnort a couple of times. Can I just say thank God or else this would have been a full-blown rant, for sure The pacing is actually pretty fast; I went through this book a lot quicker than I ever thought that I would, and it did, for the most part, hold my attention. However, it held my attention for almost all the wrong reasons. Here, let me explain: First up, everyone, we have our maestro of this disaster, Mara DYER (hint, hint, people about her speshul-ness) I know that I've said that people have been insane before, but this girl literally is one of the most insane characters that I've ever read about. Until at about this point in the book I at least had a small grasp on the belief that she hadn't totally lost it, but, at these lines, I totally abandoned any support for this character. I know that some books are meant to have the MCs bust a nut, like Katniss from the Hunger Games, but Mara's break with reality was not believable and somewhat scary/absurd especially because we're supposed to believe that she's not insane. : \"This must be very difficult for you.\" You have to admit, the paranoia was humorous. What could the detective possibly know? That I thought Morales should die and she died? Crazy. That I wanted the dog's owner punished for what he did to her and he was? Laughable. Thinking something does not make it true. Wanting something does not make it real. \"Yes, it is very difficult.\" I said, nodding again, making the hair fall farther over my face to mask my insane grin. \"I'm sorry for your loss,\" he said. My shoulders trembled with the attempt to stifle my laughter. Back it up, you crazy-ass bitch. I will kill you if you come one step closer. How in the hell am I supposed to defend and believe in the fact that she's not insane when she does things like that? There are also other times ( I believe 4-6 other times) to support this where she just stands somewhere for up to two hours and has no idea what she did there and why she just stood there for so long. Her \"ability,\" which I will talk about later, should not attribute to any of these \"episodes\" that she has. I can't even comprehend any of what she does; it's all so random, and put in the worst situations that make me anything but like Mara Dyer. I wouldn't touch that girl with a ten-foot pole if I saw her in real life. Call me cruel, but after you kill someone then you start maniacally laughing about it; about how funny it all is, then I will not be friends with you or even equate myself with you. Ever. Oh, and another thing that really annoyed me? How much she complained about her \"perfect brother\" this and \"he should be less perfect\" that. All she ever does is gripe about how perfect he is, and not in a joking manner either. She means it as in the teenage angst why does he have to be so perfect while I'm not kind of way. You know what, Mara? Your brother has been nothing but kind, gracious, and covering your sorry little ass every step of the way! Let me list them, here: 1. He talks and convinces your mother several times to let you come out and hang out with people your age, while your mom thinks you're too mentally unstable to do so and, frankly, I agree with the woman 2. When he does convince your mom he has to promise to not leave your side and basically alienate the rest of society; even the girl he really likes, to stick by you to make sure you don't go crazy and start laughing manically by yourself in corners about killing people. 3. He drives your sorry ass to school every single day even when you're being depressed and in that typical Bella Swan kind of \"oh, woe is me my life sucks I hate everyone\" moods which, by the way, happened a lot. 4. He is constantly out for your best welfare, and apologizes to you right away if he's done something, in your definition of it, \"wrong\". Most of the time it isn't even his fault and really shouldn't apologize to you, but he swallows his pride anyways. 5. He's basically the prefect blend of being attentive to your needs and not being over protective (like your mom is) and still letting you still do your own thing without judging you. So, why in the hell are you whining about how perfect he is and wishing he do something bad in his life to lower himself to your sorry level? Without him, you'd have probably killed yourself by now. You wouldn't have been able to do half of the things that you did without him! Just for once, be grateful for the amazing gift your brother has given you by staying with you through thick, thin, and always has you covered. I just......I just.....*snaps* STOP BEING SUCH A LITTLE BITCH, MARA! I would rather have read a book just about Daniel and his girlfriend than read about you. Also, whenever Mara's with her family, she's on this constant, never-ending loop with them. Their dynamic never changes even after several tragedies, and it's just so.......stagnant. It goes something like this: Mara's mom freaks out. Mara gets mad at her mom for freaking out for perfectly good reasons . Daniel walks in. Daniel tells Mara something important about life and helps her. Mara makes a snide comment about him being \"perfect\". Mara feels oh-so-sorry about Mara and Daniel and mom. Mara sleeps. Aaaaannnnd repeat. In short: Mara is annoying, selfish, self-centered, and insane. I'm not one of those kind of people that tends to enjoy that kind of writing, characterization, and repetitiveness. If you truly do and are the .0000000000000000000001 percent that enjoy that then, by all means, go for it. And now, we have our illustriously lame, ineffable man-whore, Noah! But you've had sex with people before!\" (Mara) \"That was just for fun\" ( you fucking little man-whoreish bastard Noah) Nothing more needs to be said about.....about that. I have thoroughly insulted you with French insults, now. Okay, just one more thing. By saying that comment am I not in any way against sex. If you want to do that with a person and you're just doing for \"fun\" then by all means. If you are, however, with a girl and tricking them into believing that you are some chaste saint, even though you've had sex with the entire female student body; going through them like used condoms, no less, then you can still say stuff like....like that and have them still like you; then that's just messed up. Again, I'm not going to stand by your relationship, or with you as a person if you go around saying shit like that to a girl. Especially if all you want to do is \"fix\" said girl; take her on as your little project to make into the person you want her to be. Saying you want to help and fix someone is fine and cute if used sparingly, but when the person messes up that you're trying to help and you take is as your own failure because your obviously didn't \"fix them enough\" that's when it becomes a problem. Mara is her own person and should be treated as such no matter how much I may dislike her. She needs to be able to change herself, not you change her for her. That's not how it works or should work. This quote, actually, is the only time I ever agree with Mara about Noah. \" Is that how you see this working? I'll screw up and you'll take care of it, right?\" I was just another problem that could be solved if only we threw enough time or practice or money at it. At me. And when I failed, he would just blame himself. Otherwise, though, Mara was about as dull as a fruit fly when it came to their relationship. I already talked about Mara, though, so back to Noah! I guess the one thing left that I would like to delve into about Noah was how Hodkin changed the normal dynamic (view spoiler) [ with the girl is the magic healer and the boy is the destroyer. (hide spoiler) ] Now in this book that's the opposite; (view spoiler) [ Mara is the killer ( mean, come on, Mara DYER?) and Noah has the healing powers. (hide spoiler) ] I can imagine Hodkin sitting in a chair if I interviewed her going Me: So, Hodkin I would like to talk to you about Mara. Hodkin: Yes, yes, sure! About how much you loved her? Me: Uhhhhhhh we'll......no. I actually had some problems with- Hodkin: Sure, yeah, right. Did you notice how I made Noah the one with the healer powers? Me: That wasn't my question but, yeah, sure, if you want to talk about that I- Hodkin: Wasn't it awesome! It's so different and cool! Me: Well, actually, I do agree with the fact that it is different if you do it correctly, but I felt like there wasn't enough of a backbone to it, and the only time he used it was on Mara, (many times just to find out if she was lying when he asked inmate questions) and he really didn't seem to focus on helping people. Or anyone but himself, really. He didn't even notice Mara sometimes. He just wasn't much of a healer, so it didn't really work for me. Hodkin: ....... Me: .......... Hodkin: ........... Me: ......... Hodkin: ........ Me: You still alive in there, Hodkin? Helooooooo? Hodkin: ....... Me:......... Hodkin: ........ Me: ...... Hodkin: .......... Me: *blinks* Hodkin: But....but he's sooooo hawt! The rest doesn't matter! Me: Uhhhhhh...... Hodkin: He's such an awesome healer! It's soooooooo different! Me: Me: Goodbye, Michelle Hodkin. And last, but certainly not least, the poorly-written, non-preferable, plot! Although I said this book was a quick read, it wasn't a fun read. There were so many in-between points where it was just an endless repetition of the same exact scene, but just slightly different. She probably could have cut a solid quarter of the book if she or her editor had noticed. I understand that there has to be a certain word count to publish a work for certain publishers, but if you can't get enough words in then you probably shouldn't submit it, or, if it's just that good, you'll submit it below the word count and they'll just like it that much. I would really rather not have to re-read the same lines or plot threads about ten times in one book. It's just not.......not what I want to do when I spend ten dollars on a book, obviously. Oh, and there's a quote on the back of this book where an author who is supporting this book said at points you need to \"hide under your bed covers\" so, I tend to assume that that means there will be some scary/gruesome parts in this book. Was there? NO. There was never a single point in this whole novel that made me feel like I needed to hide or was going to pee my pants. The three times when people do die are not in any way terrifying; one is just a normal news report and we are only given details that her body is \"horribly mutilated\" and hear about a picture that was leaked on the internet. That's all. The two deaths we do actually see first hand are not overly graphic, and any other scenes that I would have expected to be scary weren't. It was almost over-dramatized, in way. Mara freaks out and becomes absorbed with soooo many small, insignificant things, that any horror or scariness disappears. When you read this book, expect a slightly darker theme, harsher language (there were actually a couple of fucks in there!) but that's it. Don't go into this having your breath catch in suspense or fear. Not gonna happen. Like I said earlier, I really can understand why people would like this book. The common tropes like sleep-in-bed-with-your-love-interest-without-the-parents-knowing, and everything else that I listed is a lot more subtle than other novels like Halo, Hush, Hush, or Fallen, but my main point? It's. Still. There. Having said that, the masochist in me will read the next book; hopefully there will be more character development and the plot will get going. I beg on my knees crying I hope that it will get better, but doubt it. If there's a main thing I would say to this book it would be this, in the end: Now here's a non-boring picture of the Doctor! In the end, go ahead and read this book, but do so cautiously. You may be like me and hate it, you may be like some of my other friends and enjoy it. This review is just going out as a general warning to be careful.

But the past has a way of following you wherever you go. Mara realises this when her reality start to fracture and she starts to question her own sanity. The lines between reality and fantasy begin to blur. Until she meets, Noah Shaw. The school heartthrob and heart breaker. I'd like to mention that I loved, loved, loved Noah! I find it very difficult to stick this book under one genre. It's pnr, ya, fantasy, romance and just plain brilliant! I was never bored, I didn't hate the heroine. There was no whining, no unnecessary angst and the story was engaging. I loved the writing! I'll keep this short, I can't write a review on this book without giving away the plot. I went in blind, you should too! Why are you reading this review? Stop! ...more I\u2019m definitely with Aunt Cassie (Clare) on this book.

I\u2019m sure the plot wasn\u2019t perfectly played and I definitely spotted loopholes in the storyline but you don\u2019t get to read a lot of good paranormal stories these days. The school setting and bullies were stereoptypical and the romance wasn\u2019t something I haven\u2019t read before but I don\u2019t know, I felt hypnotized. It probably has to do with the writing through the unreliable narrative voice of Mara which is funny, thoughtful, a bit creepy and mysterious but definitely gripping. When a girl tells a story about how she could be the suspect for the murder of her friends, you definitely WILL listen. ;) You\u2019ll listen more when she tells you about this perfectly beautiful guy (despite his always tousled look) who smells of ocean and sandalwood. (Why do hawt guys in books usually smell like sandalwood?) One of my favorite things about a book is when it reaches the part where I get an explanation of the title or of the cover of the book. Some books sadly don\u2019t get to that part at all. This book definitely did earning my well-deserved \u201cooohs\u201d and \u201caaaahs.\u201d Of course it ends with a cliffy which I don\u2019t mind because I\u2019ll be reading the second and third book very soon!

It's not because I want you to understand how I felt about it; it's not that I have anything particularly inspiring or interesting to say. In fact, this quite nicely mirrors the sort of experience this book gave me. Sometimes, when I'm reading a fucking terrible book, I have to stop and wonder: why did no one catch this? I'm sorry to keep banging on and on and on and repeating the same dreck over and over but seriously, why did no one pull the author or the agent or the editor aside in the ladies' room and ask them what the fresh hell they were thinking with this thing? It's bad enough that it's clich\u00e9 and that the characters are completely tone deaf to everything that's going on around them, even stuff that involves dead teachers and kidnapped brothers and Mara's dead friends, but the writing itself is cack-handed to heights never before seen, so much so that we barely know what's going on, even when the characters struggle to explain it. The plot begins a mystery, and ends a mystery, and it's like the author didn't know what she was actually writing about, but just needed a magical background to make the romance less stale. Newsflash: the romance is stale as fuck. It's like those dodgy rolls you left at the bottom of the bread bin, because it's been a while since you barbecued burgers, and there's only two left, not enough for everyone to have one, and you kept telling yourself you'd figure out something to do with them, but it just never really happened. And then three months later you open up the bag and you think, \"Maybe I'll finally use them,\" but when you turn one over it's the colour of moss. That's not cute. This book thinks it's cute, though. It thinks it's fucking adorable. It thinks that just because a dude is foreign it's okay for him to behave with all of the social grace of an anglerfish, and it's not creepy that our heroine falls in instalove with him, it's just sweet, because this book is a romance, okay? And if we tell you it's a romance then you're not allowed to find it psychotic. And then there's the magical realism which isn't trash, it's ingenious, because we've done vampires and angels and werewolves and this book is just so much more sophisticated than that - so sophisticated, in fact, that we don't even know what it is. What exactly is Mara Dyer's unbecoming? Because this book was the unbecoming of me. ...more Re-read in November 2014 THE ENDING THE ENDING OH MAN I FORGOT THAT WAS THE ENDING.

But it's basically about Mara Dyer (SURPRISE) who has PTSD after an accident that killed all her friends. So she and family move to a new town. Start a new life. But these weird hallucinations keep happening and Mara is freaking out of her braaaaaaain. AND IT'S REALLY ADDICTIVE. That's what I really long for in books!! I want to not be able to put it down!! I want to have 982343 questions and be flipping pages to find out!! Plus the writing style is really easy to read and it didn't feel bogged down with details or slow at any point. HUZZAH. And the characters. Omg. I have a severely small tiny huge gargantuan love of these characters. Don't doubt that statement, okay? Just go with it. For once Mara has a family. YES. A FAMILY. And they actually impact her life!! Holy macaroni, what is this dream I'm living. *ahem* So I loved Mara of course, because she is kind of sassy and sarcastic and yet a total unreliable narrator and very unhinged. It was hard to know if something was real or not. But that's why I liked the story?! REAL OR NOT REAL, KATNISS. YOU TELL ME. And she had an awesome relationship with her brother Daniel . He was a fun dude who really cared about his little sister. Even though they were kinda mean to each other sometimes. (Also her mother was Indian, so I'm a little disappointed Mara wasn't more Indian...but she was very specifically \"nothing like her mother\". Gah. Opportunity for a POC and....ya missed it. boo.) Oh and Noah. Let's talk about Noah. BUT HOW DO WE TALK ABOUT NOAH. GAH. THIS BOY. He's a complex mess and reminded me so so much of Miles from Made You Up . He's the love interest and kinda snarky and mean and has so many rumours and is rich and basically insufferable at the same time as he's really caring. AND IDEK I JUST LIKED HIM. The romance is quite intense in this book. I did like it, but at times I wished it focused more on the mystery aspects instead... And I really liked the hallucination aspect because it felt so...unhinged. The entire book really caught that. And it was shiveringly good. But there were a few things I wasn't so fond of, which I shall squall here: \u2022 It gets confusing towards the end. Like some of the circumstances are SO outrageous and unlikely I thought they'd end up being hallucinations...but...they weren't? Hmm. \u2022 Going off above...I had to suspend disbelief a lot. Me no likee. \u2022 The school and the bullying seemed just..cliche? Gah. Maybe I'm being too fussy... \u2022 Mara's parents seemed awfully eager to believe she wasn't having a rough time...maybe they were just being oblivious on purpose? But they seemed okay to let her run out with Noah ALL THE TIME when it was clear she should be, erm, maybe looked after a little more closely. \u2022 Mara's name is kinda a spoiler...Don't look up her name, obviously, if you don't want to know. But I knew already so I already figured out a TON of stuff about her just on her name. So that backfired for the author. Oops? \u2022 Also Mara gets a REALLY awesome friend, Jamie, who's like gay and black and genius and super interesting ...but he sort of just gets dumped from the plot line?! Like he means ZERO to the story and then gets cut out and....I'm annoyed. I hate it when heroines can't have friends because all they can focus on is their BOYFRIEND. Meeerp. Basically it was a solidly liked book for me! YAYAYAYA. I haven't had one in a few reads now! BLISSFUL HAPPINESS. And by \"happy\" I mean so-many-people-got-murdered-and-it-was-freaky-and-I-need-the-sequel-right-now-because-dangit-cliffhanger-of-torture-right-there. Gotta love those endings. GOTTA LOVE THIS BOOK BASICALLY. ...more I think this was probably my most anticipated book in the past months, and I also think that was it's downfall. You really look forward to a book.

Disturbing hallucinations. Then Edward from Twilight pops up. Well hello there - I know Mara and Bella sound similar, but sorry, wrong book buddy! Other than being a 17 year old who speaks several languages, gets straight As without ever paying attention or having to study, has loads of money, an incredibly big house, and no girl who's ever been able to get under his skin until the new girl arrives - the new girl who falls unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him - he's very original, right? If this wasn't enough to convince you, he composes music. That's right! We've got an impostor! *End rant* I have a soft spot for thrillers and creepy stories. Always have. My best birthday was when my mom brought me to see Carrie 2 when I was 14 (which was horrible btw, but still, it was Carrie!). So I still quite enjoyed that part of the story. The part where Mara pictures someone dead, and the next day they're found exactly like she pictured. The part where Mara sits down to drink a glass of water, and what seems to be 5 minutes later, 4 hours has passed. The creepy parts were very well done. I was thus still entertained for the most part. The last 100 pages or so is what pushed me off the cliff. I wasn't fond of the way it ended, at all. I thought it could have been much more\u2026 again\u2026 original. I felt like Hodkins took the easy way out. I had so many cool theories and guesses on what was happening with Mara, and they were all worthless. There wasn't really anything to guess, it was just very plain. *I guess I wasn't done* Now, has anyone ever wondered why we needed to have a homosexual jew, crocodiles, and an abused dog in this story? Or any one story? Let's also not forget the case her father was working on, which was put there as a bonus \"twist\" to the story, but seemed incredibly out of place and unnecessary. It felt like I was reading several plots/novels all mushed in together to give us this jumbled mess. I was going to give this one three stars because of the eerie factor and great beginning - it was actually getting 4 before the last hundred pages. But after having written this, I can't. The bad clearly trumps the good in this book. ...more I...I can't even...what in the world... DID I JUST READ? This book is wrong in so many ways. Wrong and confusing. Wrong, confusing and weird. What is wrong? Pfftt, honey, the whole book is wrong to be exact. I just can't believe that this book, with such an amazing cover plus having an awesome *trailer (With a hot hero) which can convince almost everyone to read this and then having such a mysterious yet gripping blurb to make this book sound so good to the readers here, can be so...bad. * http://w I...I can't even...what in the world...

Let me start with the story. ESPECIALLY the story. This girl Mara wakes up in the hospital. Her problem? Can't remember the day her friends Rachel, Claire and boyfriend, Jude died. Then the story goes on and suddenly shes starts seeing the ghosts of her friends. (Acceptable, yes.) After a while she kills a man just by imagining it. (Yeah this has taken my attention, I am starting to like this book) But then there is this huge, huge gap in which every single fuck is forgotten and we see Noah and Mara spending the whole time together. (My thoughts? =Where did the whole story go?)Then she kills another woman by imagining it. (Okay, alright, this is getting boring now.) Thinking this is not weird? Let me tell you this then. Her small brother is kidnapped out of nowhere. (Please tell me I am reading the same freaking book right now -.-) Then after a while, we come to know Noah has powers. Girly, lame powers, which do not make sense to any sane human mind. (What in the world? Where did thhhattt come from? Wasn't Noah supposed to be, just the simple, hot hero? Goshh...) Remember that Mara still sees the ghosts while this all shit is happening. After that, she tries to kill the person who has kidnapped her brother. And because of that we had to suffer the whole, \"Mara you can't do this, but Noah I have to, I am breaking up with you\" for I don't know how many pages, even though THE DUMB ASS hero told her about the villain in the first place. And then shes doesn't shoot because another totally random woman has shot the villain and stuff and then Mara is feeling all like, I am murderer and complete shit and when she goes the to police station to surrender herself, she sees Jude. and HES ALIVE. Get it? GET IT? That was the whole book. The Characters? Don't even get me started. Mara - A totally, officially A* stupid weird heroine, who's point of view wasn't so pleasant to read. Half of the book is about her being all like, \"I am mad but oooh, theres Noah, the perfect hero, Noah. Who can fix me. So in the end, I am not mad.\" After a while, \"What if I am mad?\" *Facepalm* Noah - A totally hot boy with girls all dying to get his attention and yet who does he actually choose? Yes folks, you guessed it. The loser heroine. He bares her for almost all of the book and they do not even make-out properly in this book (and here was I expecting all kissing and stuff) and then what do we get out of it? Yes you guessed it again. Hes not normal too because hes has these girly healing, sensing shitty powers. Yay! Sucks to be you Noah. Jamie - An adopted black bisexual Jewish, with dreadlocks and a tongue ring. O.O Next person please. Daniel - Way too perfect brother to be true. Joseph - Honey, you were just in the story to be kidnapped. And in the end, all I could possibly do was, read the negative reviews and agree with them. 2/5 stars, 1 stars for the starting of the book which was actually going really good and 1 star some scenes which I liked. So my fellow goodreads, I have told you my side of the story, now the choice is yours. You can either read this or you can just move on to another book which, trust me, will be far more satisfying than this book. The faith of your brain cells is in your hands. Choose wisely. I am still like this right now... ...more I keep hearing mixed things about this series.I am intrigued to read it because of the mind thing and it really sounds interesting.Any feedback? Regardless of the flaws, this story captivated me. Everything was too easy, the characters too clich\u00e9d, the romance too center stage, considering the \"paranormal\" genre it's put in..but I'm still hooked, feeling very \"*~omg omg noah shaw*\u2661\" I absolutely loved this book! I want more of it, and I want Noah Shaw to be real! Beautiful writing, great characters, and amazing plot. Michelle Hodkin is perfect! Have you ever picked up a book and pretty much only put it down to eat and go to the bathroom (hey, i\u2019m a real person here)?! That\u2019s The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer for me! Seriously, this book is one of those \u201cunputdownables\u201d and Michelle Hodkin wrote this book just for me. Even if I read it 3 years after it was published. She wrote it for meeeee.

Second read showed me that, this book was not at all perfect as I thought it was, the first time I read it. But still, the 5 stars remain. I've read this book back in 2012 I think. I loved it then, I still love it now. Although, I'd have to be honest, I did notice a few of my bookish pet peeves on this book, that I wasn't very particular before. I think it's because I've read a lot of book since then, so my taste in books sort of changed. I know the things I like better now than before. And there were stuff in this book, that I actually hated, but still loved at the same time. Sounds confusing huh? Anyways, I'll explain more later. HOW IT BEGINS The ornate script of the board twistd in the candlelight, making the letters and numbers dance in my head. THE GIST I opened my eyes. A persistent machine beeped rhythmically to my left. Mara woked up in a hospital bed, without any memory of what happened the night before. At first, she thought she passed out only by a day. But no. She was passed out for four days. She was trying to remember what happened and why she couldn't remember. \"You were at the Temerlane -\" she started. PS: The Tamerlane is an old, abandoned asylum that was said to be haunted. Her mother continued on to explain to her, that the building collapsed over them. They were trapped. When the police came, they heard her screaming. She was lucky that the accident only left her a few bruises. The others with her weren't so lucky. Her best friend, Rachel. Her boyfriend, Jude. And Jude's sister, who I can't seem to remember the name Claire. Were all dead. What I got was a diagnosis. Post traumatic stress disorder, the psychologist said. Nightmares and visual hallucinations were my new normal, apparently, and something about my behavior in the psychologist's office made him recommend a long-term care facility. Yep. Mara has lost her screws. I actually thought at first, it was probably Survivor's guilt she was experiencing. But no. What was happening to her was more than that. Mara suggested that they move. She felt that it would be better for her not to be in places where she would remember Rachel, and Jude, I guess, but more of Rachel. Her parents, wanting what's best for her, decided to move. So moving meant, starting over at a new school. Mara was not too excited about that either. On her first day at Croyden, she already managed to get on the bad side of the Queen bee, embarass herself in front of the class, and meet a guy. He was beautiful. And he was smiling at me. Smiling at me like he knew me. But. I turned my head, wondering if there was anyone behind me. Nope. No one there. When I glanced back in the boy's direction, he was gone. Was he another one of her hallucinations? Why was she having them? Will she ever get better? MEET THE CHARACTERS Mara Dyer \u201cFix me,\" I commanded him. \"This thing, what I've done - there's something wrong with me, Noah. Fix it.\" Who we already know is not her real name. I have lots of love for this lady. What she was going through, was not at all easy. I get that she's getting freaked out about the things happening around her. Because really, how would you feel if you are intentionally wanting people to die, but then you don't really mean it, but they die anyway. Does that make sense? The first time I read about her, I thought she was fantastic. A little crazy. Okay not a little, loads crazy. But I liked her. The second time I read this book, which was very recent, I felt a bit disconnected with her because I realised, she had one of my least favorite quality in a female character. She was so fucking insecure about herself , to the point that sometimes, it was so annoying. That party incident , I was shaking my head the entire time. Unfortunately, I lost all my bookmarkings for this book because I changed phones.. sorry guys.. I can't quote them all right now. But other than that, Mara's a normal girl who's also a killing machine. She has hormones. She's attracted to a guy who unfortunately for her, is mine. She's crazy. See. Told you. Perfectly normal. Oh and might I add, that I really love how she talks back to Noah. She's not head over heels in love with him immediately, which was good. She was attracted, yes, but not crazy in love like most YA girls are in books. I don't like book characters who immediately throw themselves on the feet of the lead male, just because they showed a little interest. Okay, throwing themselves at their feet is a bit exaggerated, but you get where I'm coming from right? Noah Shaw \u201cI'm not making you hate me. I'm making you love me.\u201d Seriously? How could anyone hate this guy? Noah Shaw is perfection. Oh my god. I could not even begin to tell you guys how much this dude made me feel. British. Sweet. Smart. British. Caring. Funny. Respectful. British. Handsome. Sexy. British. See. How could anyone not love Noah Shaw? Okay enough of that. Joking aside, Noah Shaw is just one of the best male book character ever created in the YA universe. I couldn't even explain why, but his character just have that appeal. He has that magnet that just draws people in to him, without him meaning to. He was good for Mara. He did nothing, but help her get over whatever it was she was going through. Not enough though. But there are two more books, so we'll just have to find out what other stuff, Noah has up his sleeve to make Mara less crazy. Minor Characters Firstly, I would have to say that Daniel is the best brother ever. Jamie is a good friend to Mara. Mara's mom is as crazy as her, in taking care of her. Ana is a stupid cliche that shouldn't have been in this book. THE ROMANCE \u201cYou like me,\u201d he finally said. \u201cYou like me, like me.\u201d He was trying not to smile. \u201cNo. I hate you,\u201d I said, hoping that saying it would make it so. \u201cAnd yet, you draw me.\u201d Noah was still smug, completely undeterred by my declaration. This was torture; worse somehow than what just happened, even though it was only the two of us. Or because it was only the two of us. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy what?\u201d What could I say? Noah, despite you being an asshole, or maybe because of it, I\u2019d like to rip off your clothes and have your babies. Don\u2019t tell.\u201d I ship these two. Honestly, they were so cute together, even when they were sort of arguing, but not really. There were a lot of times, that Mara was trying so hard not to like Noah. Come on Mara. There is no use denying. There's no use in forcing yourself not to like Noah, she's already under his spell. Mara and Noah are a match made in heaven. Oh sorry, let me correct that. NOAH AND I BELONG TOGETHER. FINAL RAMBLINGS I made notes on what I need to put on my final ramblings, but unfortunately, I lost all of it on my phone. WWAAAAHHH! . Right now, I am at a blank. Anyways, here are some of the things I liked and didn't like. Highlight - very original plot line - interesting characters - the creepiness, eerieness of the book stayed althroughout - consistent - Noah Shaw Lowlight - Mara (sometimes when she's being unreasonable and stubborn, especially towards the last part of the book) - cliffhanger (who the-fuck likes cliffhangers?) When I remember some of the points I failed to say on this review, I would be updating this, but for now... This is my review for The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer. I highly recommend this series for people who are into YA paranormal romance. Let me know if you've read this book and would like to discuss it. ...more This book has been on my tbr since forever and I never had the vibe to start it.

Until now. \"Thinking something does not make it true. Wanting something does not make it real.\" This is one of the most confusing shits I've ever read. With an unique premise, Hodkin introduced a Twilightish cheesy teen drama full of cliches and psychological shenanigans. It had more parts that really made me get pissed than I think I needed. With a lot of unnecessary scenes, slut shaming, a sexist bastard and left a lot desired in the horror/creepy factor. And yet, with lots of flaws, this book was able to get my whole attention. And my sleep. Not because it was scary or anything like that, but because it was intriguing. And crazy. And addictive. \"No one would know that somewhere out there is a B student with a body count. And it\u2019s important that you know, so you\u2019re not next.\" Mara Dyer is the one who tells her story. After an accident, she lost her friends and got diagnosed with PTSD. When her family agrees to move to Florida, Mara meets new people and have to get used to the new environment. \u201cNone of this matters, because you're not going to listen to your token black Jewish bi friend, are you?\u201d Her first friend is Jamie. A really nice guy and a really good friend. He is really intelligent and knows how to defend his people as well as to threat others. I think he should have been more developed but maybe we will get more of him in the next book. I loved him in the beginning of the book but when Mara turns into a lovesick girl, there's no more space for the others characters, which was a pity :/ \u201cDid I just see you litter?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m driving a hybrid. It cancels out.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re horrible,\u201d I said, without conviction. \u201cI know.\u201d Which gets me to introduce Noah. I have mixed feelings for him. In the beginning he is the biggest asshole I've ever seen as a lead. The millionaire perfect guy with perfect body who slept with all the girls in the state school. And of course, he is really intelligent and loves puppies. He doesn't care about the world or who he hurts. Until he sees Mara and all the crap you can imagine happens. Bad boy meets new girl. Add a little Mystery and lots of money so that the dream can work and don't forget the car. Aaaand we have the book. But at some point he changes and although the cheesiness begins, he was not one of those boring characters that would just give up because \"we love each other but I know you will be better without me\". Bullshit. And in the middle of all the love, people are dropping dead in the city and maybe, just maybe, Mara has something to do with it. For me, the most fantastic thing about this book was the way the madness is treated. In most of the books I've read the feels were not even close to what Michelle was able to pass here. This was confusing as hell and I could never know for sure if what I was reading was really happening or if it was one of her illusions. But hell, this is what I wanted. Mad people don't know what is real and what is in their head. This is what I was expecting. But were they really illusions? \u201cYou sure you\u2019re ready?\u201d He looked skeptical. \u201cHell, yes,\u201d I lied. I smiled for emphasis. \u201cBecause we can turn around if you want.\u201d I can\u2019t say his suggestion wasn\u2019t appealing. Warm covers usually win over midnight excursions in the freezing cold.\" Mara also has two brothers: Joseph is the youngest and Daniel is the oldest. They were really awesome brothers and well developed characters. They weren't only in the background and they would always help each other. \u201cWait,\" I said as Noah slipped a book from a shelf and headed toward the door. \"Where are you going?\" \"To read?\" But I don't want you to. \"But I need to go home,\" I said, my eyes meeting his. \"My parents are going to kill me.\" \"Taken care of. You're at Sophie's house.\" I loved Sophie. \"So I'm...staying here?\" \"Daniel's covering for you.\" I loved Daniel. \"Where's Katie?\" I asked, trying to sound casual. \"Eliza's house.\" I loved Eliza. \"And your parents?\" I asked. \"Some charity thing.\" I loved charity.\" I also loved the writing style. Aside from all the crazy feelings that I got, we had some interesting moments full of hidden meanings and witty jokes. In the end, things make sense and I really hope the next one is even better. However I must warn you. This is not a book for everybody. If you are expecting some really creepy and horror styled book, this is not for you. If you are expecting a view of the story told from far away, this is not for you. Get ready to get inside some crazy shit mixed with some team drama Mean Girls style. If you like it, then think about it ;) PS: \u201cThe two of us snuggled like quotation marks in his room full of words.\u201d Was it just me who read this and thought about \"Shatter Me\"? Hodkin have been reading too much Tahereh Mafi. ...more *About 2 Stars* I know there is no shortage of five star ratings for this book, but I think I completely missed the bus on this one...

It was overwhelming and confusing, and I honestly couldn't keep up. It was as though the plot kept pushing to be paranormal, but didn't quite hit the mark and instead delivered loose clusters of supernatural innuendos. After surviving a would-be fatal accident, Mara awakes in the hospital with no recollection of the tragic events which led her there. Shortly after her release, her world, along with her sanity, begin to crumble. Strange things start happening: People are dying. Mara is seeing ghosts that never remotely explain their presence. She randomly blacks out and loses large blocks of time. Hallucinations plague her and her mental state declines. Mara feels hopeless in world set against her-- until Noah enters the picture and their two mysterious worlds collide. There are two more books that complete this series, so I'm sure everything will come together eventually. However, I do feel that the first book should at least offer a solid foundation of the story, and unfortunately, I never seemed to gain that footing. The characters, with the exception of a few questionable ones, were pretty well-rounded and likable. The beginning was exciting and I honestly feel this book had potential. The ending did ignite some major intrigue, and had I not been frustrated with the center of this story, I think I really would have found this to be an good read.

For the most part, I can quickly anticipate twists and turns in a book fairly quickly, or at least well before the conclusion is about to reveal itself. However, with The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer I had no clue what Hodkin\u2019s intentions were or when she was going to throw the next curve. I have hundreds and hundreds of books under my belt and she stumped me completely. Absolute genius!! I loved the relationship between Mara and Noah. It was edgy, fun, full of snarky dialog, but most of all it felt real. I definitely feel that Hodkin\u2019s created a pair of main characters that can carry this series for another few books. I\u2019m willing to invest. In this twisted story, Mara Dyer wakes up in the hospital after a tragic accident that claimed the lives of her three friends, Rachel, Claire and Jude. Mysteriously enough, though, Mara awoke from that accident unscathed\u2026 physically. In the aftermath of the tragedy, she and her family move to a new town in the hopes of putting the events of the accident behind them, but Mara quickly finds out that distance isn\u2019t the answer. As strange events begin to occur around her, Mara realizes that there was more to the accident than simply being at the wrong place at the wrong time and what begins to unravel is a twist that leaves you wanting to start from page one all over again. After that last line in the book, I can\u2019t wait for the next installment of this YA paranormal. What a trip! Reading it in one sitting, all 450 pages of it, should be telling enough that it was a definitely my type of twisted story. Loved it!!

Plot: This story gripped me from the very first page and not just plot wise, but in every single aspect of the story. It follows a girl called Mara Dyer who is the sole survivor in the collapse of an abandoned asylum. Her best friend, her boyfriend and her boyfriends sister weren\u2019t so lucky. This leaves Mara with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder which makes Mara have hallucintions that are not only creepy, but also extremely intriguing. Basically, we\u2019re left with an unreliable narrator and that just gets me so excited. Is what she\u2019s seeing real? I DON\u2019T KNOW. SO EXCITING. The plot is so intriguing and mysterious and you can\u2019t help but flip those pages and keep reading until you\u2019re provided with answers. Characters: I loved the diversity of the characters and you could really feel that they were all deeply realistic and individual. I absolutely adored Mara and her family and each character was so real and I found myself becoming so attached to them! Also, Noah Shaw. Just chucking that one in there. Writing: Absolutely beautiful, captivating and gripping throughout the entire book. I honestly haven\u2019t felt this captivated in a book since I read Twilight the first time. I just couldn\u2019t put. it. down. You can tell that this story has so much depth and that the author has thought of so much that you just don\u2019t know yet. It left me reeling! Romance/Feels: ALL OF THE FEELINGS ALL OVER THE PLACE. The romance doesn\u2019t move too fast and it\u2019s reassuring. I just fell in love with Noah Shaw. FELL SO HARD. Ending: This is the only slight problem I had! The ending got a little confusing and I had to reread parts of it, but I think that\u2019s kind of what Michelle Hodkin meant to do because Mara would have been so confused and we\u2019re left reeling along with her and this made us sucked into the story even more. So clever. Overall Enjoyment: I love everything about this book. Absolutely everything.

So what exactly was The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer about???? If I told you I\u2019d have to kill you. I\u2019m still not sure which means it was a great genre bender. Part Mean Girls , part Miriam Black, part love story, part paranormal, part thriller \u2013 it had a lil\u2019 bit of something for everyone. The great news is I had a more-than-decent time throughout the entire process even though I had no clue where the book was going or what type of story it was supposed to be. Unfortunately, Mara Dyer as well as her unbecoming falls under the curse of the dreaded book series.
