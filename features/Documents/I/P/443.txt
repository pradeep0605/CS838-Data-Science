Everything is cleverly thought out and his use of language is magical. He bends the words with ease and brings out richer meanings. The plot is an original story that unfolds as a series of riddles to a satirical account of modern India. Yet, in spite of all that, the book did not click with me. The characters remain puppets. As exotic cartoons they act out a sort of fable that sometimes appears without direction. The novel seems another example of what is by now a well-established genre in the literature of the subcontinent, that of magical allegories of the history of its Independence. Rushdie may have been the pioneer of this trend with his \u201cMidnight Children\u201d. I preferred the earlier novel. In this genre I also liked Shashi Tharoor's The Great Indian Novel , in which he mixes the Mahabharata with the account of the Partition. Since Rushdies\u2019s Enchantress of Florence is on my bookshelves anyway, I will certainly read one more of his books and hopefully will like it better. But here is a brilliant review of the Moor that does the book better justice: http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/18... ...more I admit that I had already given The Moor\u2018s Last Sigh by <---A>Salman Rushdie</---A> a couple of unsuccessful tries before I finally challenged myself to reading it in one go a couple of weeks ago.

It seemed just the right time to plunge into something by Rushdie after I unexpectedly met him at a conference he was giving in Madrid as part of the World Book Day celebration. And yes, it was a big challenge. If one can love and hate a book at the same time, admire and despise it, crave for more and wish to finish it immediately, then I experienced it as well while turning the pages of The Moor\u2018s Last Sigh. I couldn\u2018t but admire Rushdie\u2018s genius, his boundless imagination and his capacity to interweave the lives of the characters of the book and the historical facts into one single fabric full of new colors. And at the same time I hated the slowness of the plot, which became even slower mixed with my incapacity to read Rusdhie\u2018s ornate language faster. I loved how the author\u2018s experienced hand mixed classes, religions, ethnic groups, politics, business, crime and art. And I pitied my lack of knowledge of the historical and political context, which made me miss a lot of allusions and connotations that would have made more sense for somebody living in India. I was tired of long sentences. And I relished the poetry of the language. I chose to quote one single sentence, which resumes everything I tried to say in this review, and everything I was not able to express: \u201cAnd if the flies buzzed in through the opened netting-windows, and the naughty gusts through the parted panes of leaded glass, then opening of the shutters let in everything else: the dust and the tumult of boats in Cochin harbour, the horns of freighters and tugboat chugs, the fishermen\u2019s dirty jokes and the throb of their jellyfish stings, the sunlight as sharp as a knife, the heat that could choke you like a damp cloth pulled tightly around your head, the calls of floating hawkers, the wafting sadness of the unmarried Jews across the water in Mattancherri, the menace of emerald smugglers, the machinations of business rivals, the growing nervousness of the British colony in Fort Cochin, the cash demands of the staff and of the plantation workers in the Spice Mountains, the tales of Communist troublemaking and Congresswallah politics, the names Gandhi and Nehru, the rumours of famine in the east and hunger strikes in the north, the songs and drum-beats of the oral storytellers, and the heavy rolling sound (<---B>as they broke against Cabral Island\u2019s rickety jetty</---B>) of the incoming tides of history.\u201d Give it a try. Or a few. You\u2019ll love it or you\u2019ll hate it. Or both.

Like the Moor\u2019s tale, my own take on the tale is anything but coherent, scattered like Moor\u2019s loose pages all over the place, messy and chaotic. Allegorical to Mother India. Full of magical-realism, it is a realism that seems magical to the onlookers, a tragi-comedy, a tragedy to the characters, a farce to the readers, a drudge to the living. Written in 1995, this is Rushdie\u2019s first novel after The Satanic Verses , that forced an author underground because he chose to speakofy his mind not in hush-hush barely-decipherable ambiguous impotent tones but in an in-your-face to-hell-with-you don\u2019t-askofy-if-you-don\u2019t-want-the-bleddy-truth profane potent portent loudspeaker style. It was not Moor who was exiled by his Mother Aurora da-Gama Zogoiby, but the Unlucky (Zogoiby in Arabic) Rushdie, the Indian bastard (or as Rushdie-Moor likes it, baas stink , turd no translation needed ) of a non-Indian community who was disowned and thrown out by Mother India, hurtling towards an imminent death perhaps at double the speed of his biological life-span, cursed by another Mother-Rumpelstiltskin who wanted him all for herself. The Moor\u2019s tale, then, is not just an allegory to Modern Mother India, or to her unfortunate children, but also particularly to one special crippled child Rushdie himself, betrayed by his mother, his housekeeper Miss Jaya He (see the point? It is a phrase in the National Anthem, loosely meaning Victory/Hail! -to who-else-but-Mom-India?) , by his only lover artist Uma Sarasvati (Two Indian Goddesses in one \u2013 Uma , the wife of Shiv-who-destroys Sarasvati , the incarnation of knowledge, therefore, the brilliant girl who destroyed Moor), and lastly, by his own Muse Vasco Miranda (an allusion to another profane blasphemous Indian artist M.F. Hussain, exiled by our Mom?) for whom Moor\u2019s mother Aurora was once his own Muse. Where to start? After all this long dithering, I haven\u2019t startofied my review yet. When Moor\u2019s own tale is all over the place, how do I know where to begin? When the tale itself is a pastiche, a random sticking of images and histories that has its own method to madness, when there is no clear beginning but only a vertigo where anything can come first, beware, O Readers, I too will stick-o-fy my point wherever I wish, like Moor stickofies one page of his tale to a tree and the other to a wall and a third to a well until they\u2019re all over Benengeli, and don\u2019t point-o-fy your fingers at me if you don\u2019t like my jabberings lest I Jaw-Jaw at you like that now-stuffed dog. Ah, but it all began with the spicy \u201cspices\u201d trade, didn\u2019t it? The Portuguese had the hots for all our hot stuff and came here crossing half the world for a pinch of pepper. And then the Jews, the exiles from their own Mothers came sailing and sat down in Cochin, becoming the Cochin Jews, and also came all the Portuguese Christians, all of them with their hidden mysteries that led them here, and went into the pepper trade. So here we come to the Portuguese Epifania and Francisco da Gama in the early 1900s with their children -Aires who married Carmen- Aunt Sahara , the flat barren desert who was never touched by her homo husband and so never reaped the fortune that lay between her legs, a legal heir, and Camoens, who married Belle who made both boobies and babies with her hubby to bring forth Mother Aurora who would marry a Cochin Jew who\u2026. But, like Moor, I\u2019m getting ahead of my tale. While we witness the interesting, hilarious events of the da-Gama family as Belle wages war against the dominating matriarch epiphany Epifania, what we witness in the in-house separation (Belle, Camoens, Francisco going anti-British-Simon-go-back, Epifania-Aires-Carmen going The-Brits-gave-us-what-all-we-have)is a microcosm of an India torn into two factions \u2013 an elite pro-British bunch, especially Christians/Portuguese afraid of giving up their pretty Anglican ways simultaneously rightly fearing Indians in charge of India, and an optimistic pro-Independence pro-equality, softly flirtatiously Marxist, heavily nationalistic euphoric duds bunch rallying under the suave charm of the English-pruned Nehru and the rustic-once-upon a-time-Angrezi-imitator-now-desi-by-choice little naked man Gandhi in-a-loin-cloth. The ballistic warfare in the da-Gama family that ends with Belle taking charge of the house and the business when national chaos descends and Aires and Camoens are dumped into jail for 15 years signals the victory of the INC, the Nehru-led Congress party that would replace the British in 1947. But as everyone knows, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru screwed up the nation that was put in his hands, that dilettante child of Macaulay who finally produced his dream Minuteman, Indians in blood and color, but English in choices and opinions , daydreaming of progress as the country burned and got beaten up in front of his closed sleeping dreaming eyes. For all his failures, I now think, Rushdie has been really kind to him, only mocking him with semi-seriousness (Aires, out of contempt, names his bulldog Jawaharlal Jaw-Jaw to annoy the pro-Nehru family-members): Shut up, Jaw-Jaw, you all-bark-no-bite-mutt\u2026 Like Jaw-Jaw Jawaharlal, they made plenty of noise but didn\u2019t draw much blood. Panditji, Congress-tho is always chickening out in the face of radical acts. No soft options will be takeofied round here. Once, indeed, there were giants on our stage; but at the fag-end of an age, Madam History must make do with what she can get. Jawaharlal, in these latter days, was just the name of a stuffed dog.(At this point in the story, the dog is dead and is stuffed by Aires to keep him \u201calive\u201d, a brilliant metaphor by Rushdie. While the World Wars rage and the Independence movement gains momentum, Aurora grows up mother-less, not so much as motherless, as her Mummy Belle hunts business deals during the day and tigers to feed upon at night, with Camoens tucked away in jail. And when Belle dies after Camoens is released, Aurora, the 13-year old kid unleashes her week-long mourning in isolation by maddeningly painting her room, pouring forth vivid confusing images of the family yarn and weaving them onto a carpet of colors. At 15, she chooses the quiet Arab-Jew clerk Abraham Zogoiby, as old as her father as her lover, and while her father dies, she moves in with him, because she cannot marry him. In the book, this is quite an interesting, roaring episode, a great commentary on religious/cultural clashes, of standing up to one\u2019s family for one\u2019s right to love, of the great complicated affair a family is within the even more complicated nuances of age-old cultural rivalries, building upon Romeo and Juliet but our lovers are no Romeo or Juliet \u2013 if they cannot marry, they will not. But they will love. Not in their sacred hearts, but in their scandalous bodies. Not from their respective captive homes, but in the freedom of their house. Let them make their own yarn. But welcome back to India. It\u2019s an independent country now. Aurora has taken V. Miranda the artist under her wing and at the dinner table, newly-found freedom is being celebrated while Hindus and Muslims massacre each other in Kashmir. Miranda lashes out at the self-deceived foolery around him: \u2019Useless fucking art-johnny clever-dicks,\u2019 he jeered. \u2018Circular sexualist India my foot. No. Bleddy tongue-twister came out wrong. Secular socialist. That\u2019s it. Bleddy bunk.

Why is Kashmir the point of contention between India and Pakistan, and not any other state, when there were and are so many other probable candidates too? It is because immediately after Independence when many states/kingdoms (Junagadh, Hyderabad, Kashmir...) wanted to be independent nations, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was appointed to unite them under India by hook or crook. Patel succeeded, but Nehru intervened. Instead of Sardar, Nehru wanted to be the one to convince Kashmir\u2019s Hindu king, who ruled the state\u2019s majority population of Muslims, to join India. Bleddy Reason: Nehru was a Kashmiri Pandit. He was so much in love with his state, the dudhead wanted the glory of salvaging his darling state and he messed it up with his ineptitude. And Hindus and Muslims, torn between India and Pakistan and the chance of becoming an independent entity, slaughtered each other, sending the nation into yet another bout of shock, paranoia, enmity and accusations. The riots haven\u2019t yet ended \u2013 they have become more frequent, all over the country. And Vasco was right. Gods are useless. Money speaks. Bleddy money speaks and bleddy gods listen. It was not an inebriated Miranda\u2019s senseless tirade \u2013 it was a spectacular summing up of how India was doomed from the very start, and would pay heavily for the foundation it had achieved its Independence on. And the consequences, in Moor\u2019s words, as we jump momentarily to the end of the novel which alludes to the turning points in India\u2019s Communal history (the demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya in December 1992 by BJP-RSS-VHP political right-wing Hindu party, and the subsequent terror attacks by Muslim extremists in Mumbai particularly and riots all over the twin countries) are: Violence was violence, murder was murder, two wrongs did not make one right: these are truths of which I was fully cognizant. Also: by sinking to your adversary\u2019s level you lose the high ground. In the days after the destruction of the Babri Masjid, \u2018justly enraged Muslims\u2019/\u2018fanatical killers\u2019 smashed up Hindu temples, and killed Hindus, across India and Pakistan as well. There comes a point in the unfurling of communal violence in which it becomes irrelevant to ask, \u2018Who started it?\u2019 The lethal conjugations of death part company with any possibility of justification, let alone justice. They surge among us, left and right, Hindu and Muslim, knife and pistol, killing, burning, looting, and raising into the smoky air their clenched and bloody fists. Both their houses are damned by their deeds; both sides sacrifice the right to any shred of virtue; they are each other\u2019s plagues. But warnings were given even earlier, when Aurora wasn\u2019t even born, by Camoens, referring to the hymn beloved to Gandhi, that says Ram/Ishwar and Allah are one, the Hindu and Islamic gods are but different names for one god, predicting the events of 1992 when the Mosque was partially demolished on the argument that Lord Ram was born there 5000 years ago, where the 400 years old mosque now stood: And they say Ishwar and Allah is your name but they don\u2019t mean it, they mean only Ram himself, king of the Raghu clan, purifier of sinners along with Sita. In the end I am afraid [\u2026] people like us will have to lock our doors and there will come a Battering Ram.\u2019 But back to old India, to the two Mothers that captured the imagination of real India, while Aurora takes hold of Moor and Moor\u2019s life, in the middle of the 20th century. From Cochin, the story swiftly moves to Bombay as the Zogoiby family relocates there and the nation transitions from political babysteps to an enfant terrible , a socio-political menace in the dexterous, able hands of Rushdie\u2019s flawlessly executed introduction \u2013 Aurora\u2019s rebellious high-parapet frenzy blasphemous scandalizing dance in contempt of Maharashtra\u2019s beloved Hindu festival, Ganesh Chaturthi , the celebration of the Elephant-headed god first used as a pretext for banned large-scale meetings by the freedom-fighter Lokmanya Tilak who fanned the flames of armed resistance against British Raj, then recently appropriated by the notorious political hard-liner party Shiv Sena to drive out poor non-Marathi migrant workers from the state, turning an innocent festival into the hotbed of religious frenzy and fanaticism and filthy opportunistic politics, where the two make unlikely but highly-compatible bedfellows. Rushdie takes a dig at Shiv Sena founder, the cartoonist-turned-militant Bal Thackeray, mocking his ugliness by adding a nickname \u201cMainduck\u201d ( Frog in Hindi) to his fictitious name Raman Fielding, blatantly accusing his party of all the dirty politics they have played, transitioning from champions of Marathi culture and people to moral policing (read: lathi-charging young couples, married or unmarried, for holding hands in public on Valentine\u2019s Day and beating the hell out of them if they become a bit cozy on other days too) to aligning with BJP-RSS-VHP and inciting communal hatred. And coming to Bombay, (ooops! Mumbai now, unless you want Shiv Sena pulping you for the indiscretion) how can we forget our silver screen Mother now, Mother India , the quintessential tale of the Indian mother, Indian bride, Indian wife, Indian woman (she doesn\u2019t exist on her own, does she?), the quintessential tale of rural agricultural India, the quintessential tale of common man which the gripped the country\u2019s imagination, with its spectacular pair of mother (played by Nargis) and rebellious son Birju (played by Sunil Dutt) who married soon in real life. The movie becomes a source of discussion for India, a metaphor for the imagined India that was so far removed from metropolitan India and yet survived through popular myth, through Metanarratives, as the essence of India. Juxtaposing the rural movie with the metro city, the fictional mother-son with real-life lovers, Aurora says, as Nargis and Sunil Dutt visit her home: \u2018The first time I saw that picture\u2019, she (Aurora) confided to the famous movie star (Nargis) on the high terrace at Elephanta, \u2018I took one look at your Bad Son, Birju, and I thought, O boy, what a handsome guy \u2013 too much sizzle, too much chilli, bring water. He may be a thief and a bounder, but that is some A-class loverboy goods. And now look \u2013 you have gone and marry-o\u2018ed him! What sexy lives you movie people leadofy: to marry your own son, I swear, wowie.\u2019 \u2018Even in the picture, but,\u2019 Aurora went relentlessly on, \u2018I knew right off that bad Birju had the hots for his gorgeous ma.\u2019 And now, Rushdie\u2019s own careful comment on the movie, which can be seen both in and out of context of the novel: In Mother India, a piece of Hindu myth-making directed by a Muslim socialist, Mehboob Khan, the Indian peasant woman is idealized as bride, mother and producer of sons; as long-suffering, stoical, loving, redemptive, and conservatively wedded to the maintenance of the status-quo. But for Bad Birju, cast out from his mother\u2019s love, she becomes, as one critic has mentioned, \u2018that image of an aggressive, treacherous, annihilating mother who haunts the fantasy life of Indian males.\u2019 And what about the other Mother India, the one that haunted real-life India? Indira Gandhi, daughter of Nehru, first female PM of India, the one who boldly broke the sanctions on India and went ahead to test India\u2019s first nuclear device in Pokhran, and in 1975 she imposed the Emergency when it became clear that she would be removed from her post. Like Aurora, she is the heroine and the antiheroine, the mother and the anti-mother figure of India\u2019s story. While the poor and the honest beg and die, or are executed, the rich and the corrupt oil each other and reap its dirty wealth. Abraham Zogoiby enters the Underworld negotiations and his business grows exponentially, while Aurora\u2019s stars as the beloved Indian artist rise and sink and rise. With Uma Sarasvati\u2019s machinations that drive mother-and-son apart, Moor\u2019s foray into Mainduck\u2019s clan, his prodigal return to his father who then has no use for him and discards him for the second time, it is India we see, everywhere, everywhere. This isn\u2019t a story about the Moor or the Zogoibys at all. It is Rushdie\u2019s impeccable skills that make you think that it is about the characters caught up in a particularly eventful century. Even though it is about India, the surface story never flags; the two are so closely intertwined together that they cannot be told without either going missing. Each one tells the other\u2019s tale. And so, when the characters aren\u2019t likeable enough, or deep enough, it is because they aren\u2019t meant to be. Generalizations are never finely woven -like a summary, they have to span over a large slice of time and eschew much of finesse. And yet, the characters are deep enough, nuanced enough to keep the reader gripped in the surface story and not just let him/her slip into the metaphorical story of India. And like the titular painting \u2018The moor\u2019s last sigh\u2019 , the final act of forgiveness that Aurora bestows upon her son Moor -India, and the Moor\u2019s tale too is a palimpsest, a painting upon a painting, a superimposition of one tale over the other. Two tales that have merged into one, even though they are different. Why this deeper story masquerading so convincingly as the surface story, or vice-versa? Because, my dears, this is what India is. A visual deception, a deception nuanced, fine enough to send the unwary casual stroller on the wrong path. The Upperworld and the Underworld don\u2019t just co-exist as allegories, they are the same story itself. They are not two sides of the same coin. It is not you-or-me, it is you-and-me. Their threads are so finely enmeshed that to destroy one is to destroy the other too. And so, readers, is Rushdie\u2019s tale. The Zogoibys and India don\u2019t just co-exist. The Zogoibys are not a metaphor for India, a microcosm, a summary of India, a representative of the land. It is not India simplified, India-for-Dummies guidebook. They and India are different, but part of the same story.

His first-person narrator ranges from funny to absurd to cruel, and Rushdie's playfulness with language is in full force here. As in Midnight's Children , Rushdie's characters are set in the context of India's turbulent history, and in typical Rushdie fashion, it isn't clear whether history is affecting the family or the family is molding history. The very end of the book seems a bit over-blown, but it's one of the few weaknesses in this very good novel. ...more I almost stopped reading this a number of times, but I have a thing about finishing books.

Like the Moor\u2019s tale, my own take on the tale is anything but coherent, scattered like Moor\u2019s loose pages all over the place, messy and chaotic. Allegorical to Mother India. Full of magical-realism, it is a realism that seems magical to the onlookers, a tragi-comedy, a tragedy to the characters, a farce to the readers, a drudge to the living. Written in 1995, this is Rushdie\u2019s first novel after The Satanic Verses , that forced an author underground because he chose to speakofy his mind not in hush-hush barely-decipherable ambiguous impotent tones but in an in-your-face to-hell-with-you don\u2019t-askofy-if-you-don\u2019t-want-the-bleddy-truth profane potent portent loudspeaker style. It was not Moor who was exiled by his Mother Aurora da-Gama Zogoiby, but the Unlucky (Zogoiby in Arabic) Rushdie, the Indian bastard (or as Rushdie-Moor likes it, baas stink , turd no translation needed ) of a non-Indian community who was disowned and thrown out by Mother India, hurtling towards an imminent death perhaps at double the speed of his biological life-span, cursed by another Mother-Rumpelstiltskin who wanted him all for herself. The Moor\u2019s tale, then, is not just an allegory to Modern Mother India, or to her unfortunate children, but also particularly to one special crippled child Rushdie himself, betrayed by his mother, his housekeeper Miss Jaya He (see the point? It is a phrase in the National Anthem, loosely meaning Victory/Hail! -to who-else-but-Mom-India?) , by his only lover artist Uma Sarasvati (Two Indian Goddesses in one \u2013 Uma , the wife of Shiv-who-destroys Sarasvati , the incarnation of knowledge, therefore, the brilliant girl who destroyed Moor), and lastly, by his own Muse Vasco Miranda (an allusion to another profane blasphemous Indian artist M.F. Hussain, exiled by our Mom?) for whom Moor\u2019s mother Aurora was once his own Muse. Where to start? After all this long dithering, I haven\u2019t startofied my review yet. When Moor\u2019s own tale is all over the place, how do I know where to begin? When the tale itself is a pastiche, a random sticking of images and histories that has its own method to madness, when there is no clear beginning but only a vertigo where anything can come first, beware, O Readers, I too will stick-o-fy my point wherever I wish, like Moor stickofies one page of his tale to a tree and the other to a wall and a third to a well until they\u2019re all over Benengeli, and don\u2019t point-o-fy your fingers at me if you don\u2019t like my jabberings lest I Jaw-Jaw at you like that now-stuffed dog. Ah, but it all began with the spicy \u201cspices\u201d trade, didn\u2019t it? The Portuguese had the hots for all our hot stuff and came here crossing half the world for a pinch of pepper. And then the Jews, the exiles from their own Mothers came sailing and sat down in Cochin, becoming the Cochin Jews, and also came all the Portuguese Christians, all of them with their hidden mysteries that led them here, and went into the pepper trade. So here we come to the Portuguese Epifania and Francisco da Gama in the early 1900s with their children -Aires who married Carmen- Aunt Sahara , the flat barren desert who was never touched by her homo husband and so never reaped the fortune that lay between her legs, a legal heir, and Camoens, who married Belle who made both boobies and babies with her hubby to bring forth Mother Aurora who would marry a Cochin Jew who\u2026. But, like Moor, I\u2019m getting ahead of my tale. While we witness the interesting, hilarious events of the da-Gama family as Belle wages war against the dominating matriarch epiphany Epifania, what we witness in the in-house separation (Belle, Camoens, Francisco going anti-British-Simon-go-back, Epifania-Aires-Carmen going The-Brits-gave-us-what-all-we-have)is a microcosm of an India torn into two factions \u2013 an elite pro-British bunch, especially Christians/Portuguese afraid of giving up their pretty Anglican ways simultaneously rightly fearing Indians in charge of India, and an optimistic pro-Independence pro-equality, softly flirtatiously Marxist, heavily nationalistic euphoric duds bunch rallying under the suave charm of the English-pruned Nehru and the rustic-once-upon a-time-Angrezi-imitator-now-desi-by-choice little naked man Gandhi in-a-loin-cloth. The ballistic warfare in the da-Gama family that ends with Belle taking charge of the house and the business when national chaos descends and Aires and Camoens are dumped into jail for 15 years signals the victory of the INC, the Nehru-led Congress party that would replace the British in 1947. But as everyone knows, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru screwed up the nation that was put in his hands, that dilettante child of Macaulay who finally produced his dream Minuteman, Indians in blood and color, but English in choices and opinions , daydreaming of progress as the country burned and got beaten up in front of his closed sleeping dreaming eyes. For all his failures, I now think, Rushdie has been really kind to him, only mocking him with semi-seriousness (Aires, out of contempt, names his bulldog Jawaharlal Jaw-Jaw to annoy the pro-Nehru family-members): Shut up, Jaw-Jaw, you all-bark-no-bite-mutt\u2026 Like Jaw-Jaw Jawaharlal, they made plenty of noise but didn\u2019t draw much blood. Panditji, Congress-tho is always chickening out in the face of radical acts. No soft options will be takeofied round here. Once, indeed, there were giants on our stage; but at the fag-end of an age, Madam History must make do with what she can get. Jawaharlal, in these latter days, was just the name of a stuffed dog.(At this point in the story, the dog is dead and is stuffed by Aires to keep him \u201calive\u201d, a brilliant metaphor by Rushdie. While the World Wars rage and the Independence movement gains momentum, Aurora grows up mother-less, not so much as motherless, as her Mummy Belle hunts business deals during the day and tigers to feed upon at night, with Camoens tucked away in jail. And when Belle dies after Camoens is released, Aurora, the 13-year old kid unleashes her week-long mourning in isolation by maddeningly painting her room, pouring forth vivid confusing images of the family yarn and weaving them onto a carpet of colors. At 15, she chooses the quiet Arab-Jew clerk Abraham Zogoiby, as old as her father as her lover, and while her father dies, she moves in with him, because she cannot marry him. In the book, this is quite an interesting, roaring episode, a great commentary on religious/cultural clashes, of standing up to one\u2019s family for one\u2019s right to love, of the great complicated affair a family is within the even more complicated nuances of age-old cultural rivalries, building upon Romeo and Juliet but our lovers are no Romeo or Juliet \u2013 if they cannot marry, they will not. But they will love. Not in their sacred hearts, but in their scandalous bodies. Not from their respective captive homes, but in the freedom of their house. Let them make their own yarn. But welcome back to India. It\u2019s an independent country now. Aurora has taken V. Miranda the artist under her wing and at the dinner table, newly-found freedom is being celebrated while Hindus and Muslims massacre each other in Kashmir. Miranda lashes out at the self-deceived foolery around him: \u2019Useless fucking art-johnny clever-dicks,\u2019 he jeered. \u2018Circular sexualist India my foot. No. Bleddy tongue-twister came out wrong. Secular socialist. That\u2019s it. Bleddy bunk.

What sexy lives you movie people leadofy: to marry your own son, I swear, wowie.\u2019 \u2018Even in the picture, but,\u2019 Aurora went relentlessly on, \u2018I knew right off that bad Birju had the hots for his gorgeous ma.\u2019 And now, Rushdie\u2019s own careful comment on the movie, which can be seen both in and out of context of the novel: In Mother India, a piece of Hindu myth-making directed by a Muslim socialist, Mehboob Khan, the Indian peasant woman is idealized as bride, mother and producer of sons; as long-suffering, stoical, loving, redemptive, and conservatively wedded to the maintenance of the status-quo. But for Bad Birju, cast out from his mother\u2019s love, she becomes, as one critic has mentioned, \u2018that image of an aggressive, treacherous, annihilating mother who haunts the fantasy life of Indian males.\u2019 And what about the other Mother India, the one that haunted real-life India? Indira Gandhi, daughter of Nehru, first female PM of India, the one who boldly broke the sanctions on India and went ahead to test India\u2019s first nuclear device in Pokhran, and in 1975 she imposed the Emergency when it became clear that she would be removed from her post. Like Aurora, she is the heroine and the antiheroine, the mother and the anti-mother figure of India\u2019s story. While the poor and the honest beg and die, or are executed, the rich and the corrupt oil each other and reap its dirty wealth. Abraham Zogoiby enters the Underworld negotiations and his business grows exponentially, while Aurora\u2019s stars as the beloved Indian artist rise and sink and rise. With Uma Sarasvati\u2019s machinations that drive mother-and-son apart, Moor\u2019s foray into Mainduck\u2019s clan, his prodigal return to his father who then has no use for him and discards him for the second time, it is India we see, everywhere, everywhere. This isn\u2019t a story about the Moor or the Zogoibys at all. It is Rushdie\u2019s impeccable skills that make you think that it is about the characters caught up in a particularly eventful century. Even though it is about India, the surface story never flags; the two are so closely intertwined together that they cannot be told without either going missing. Each one tells the other\u2019s tale. And so, when the characters aren\u2019t likeable enough, or deep enough, it is because they aren\u2019t meant to be. Generalizations are never finely woven -like a summary, they have to span over a large slice of time and eschew much of finesse. And yet, the characters are deep enough, nuanced enough to keep the reader gripped in the surface story and not just let him/her slip into the metaphorical story of India. And like the titular painting \u2018The moor\u2019s last sigh\u2019 , the final act of forgiveness that Aurora bestows upon her son Moor -India, and the Moor\u2019s tale too is a palimpsest, a painting upon a painting, a superimposition of one tale over the other. Two tales that have merged into one, even though they are different. Why this deeper story masquerading so convincingly as the surface story, or vice-versa? Because, my dears, this is what India is. A visual deception, a deception nuanced, fine enough to send the unwary casual stroller on the wrong path. The Upperworld and the Underworld don\u2019t just co-exist as allegories, they are the same story itself. They are not two sides of the same coin. It is not you-or-me, it is you-and-me. Their threads are so finely enmeshed that to destroy one is to destroy the other too. And so, readers, is Rushdie\u2019s tale. The Zogoibys and India don\u2019t just co-exist. The Zogoibys are not a metaphor for India, a microcosm, a summary of India, a representative of the land. It is not India simplified, India-for-Dummies guidebook. They and India are different, but part of the same story. 2nd part of the review - https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... ...more I found this book really hard to get into for a few reasons. I would read some and then put it down for a few days, then try to resume and be entirely confused about who was who because there are so many characters and relationships introduced at the beginning, it's very hard to keep track. Also, Rushdie's wordiness made it much harder to get into the storytelling. At first the story seemed confusing and meandering until I got all the characters and relationships figured out.

Also, Rushdie's wordiness made it much harder to get into the storytelling. At first the story seemed confusing and meandering until I got all the characters and relationships figured out. The last half seemed to pick up a lot, but I almost put the book down before I got there (which I never do). Once I got into it I found the characters and their relationships very intriguing. Plus the social and political commentary was woven fully and fairly seamlessly into the story and characters, which was really interesting. The concept of Moor aging twice as fast as anyone else also presents an unusual framework for the events that take place. So I guess my advice on this one is don't stop and start read it, because you may find it harder to enjoy. This was my first Rushdie book, not sure if I'll read another anytime soon. ...more This was a beautiful book about the end of Arab rule of Spain and has made me dream for years (unfulfilled as of yet :( to visit Alhambra in Andalusia.

At the time, I thought this is IT, this is what writing should be---but since then magic realism has become somewhat over-used---as a sort of crutch to make boring ideas interesting--similar to stream-of-conciousness rambling a generation earlier (oh yes, when it's good it's very good, but oh-so-often it is a cover for poor writing). I'm not saying that Rushdie does this HERE however---as I recall this is a solid read, though by no means a point of entry to Rushdie's work (Midnight's Children would be a much better gateway in my opinion). I probably should read this again--but I just don't have the heart. ...more \u201cThe Moor\u2019s Last Sigh\u201d has about everything you would expect from one of Rushdie\u2019s novels.

But even so some threads simply get lost or never picked up again, some of the characters introduced and then dropped. That would be the first of my main reproaches. Not that this problem is unheard of, but it is bigger a deal coming from an author who has shown that he can do better. The second is the frenzied and rushed end, evoking the feeling you get when trying to finish off something you have grown tired of. Illustrating social, political, ethnical and religious conflicts, this is equally the story of a city as it is a family saga. Throughout a great portion of the novel Bombay itself is not only the setting but as equally a protagonist as the human characters. I found it interesting to notice that despite the male narrator in a patriarchal culture, the tale is governed by women (grandmother, mother, sisters, lover). All of these women are strong and complex, but they are also demonic, unpredictable and destructive, so that their high position is based on force rather than wisdom. Even the character of the family father seems eaten up by them, since he is either the shadow of a man or a typical modern bad guy, but never acquires a second or a third dimension. You could, as always, tell the author at once by his style, syntax and trademark structure. I did enjoy reading \u201cThe Moor\u2019s Last Sigh\u201d even though is surely not Rushdie at his best.

There is much to admire A week ago I went to see Salman Rushdie talk about his memoirs. In preparation I decided to read something by him, and picked The Moor\u2019s Last Sigh from my shelf.

The truth is that this state of mind still applied when I committed to reading the book, but this time my mind was firm, so I read it from beginning to end. There is much to admire in The Moor\u2019s last sigh. Rushdie has an amazing talent for writing and the language is beautifully crafted. But sometimes this barrage of words feels like too much. The sentences are long, and unless you concentrate you easily get lost. Here is an example of a beautiful passage: \"How to forgive the world for its beauty, which merely disguises its ugliness; for its gentleness, which merely cloaks its cruelty; for its illusion of continuity, seamlessly, as the night follows the day, so to speak- whereas in reality life is a series of brutal raptures, falling upon your defenseless hands, like the blows of a woodman\u2019s axe?\u201d (The Moor\u2019s Last Sigh \u2013 Salman Rushdie) It is a lovely passage, but even when reading these lines, you have to pay a lot of attention to punctuation in order to avoid re-reading the lines a few times. The problem is that the entirety of this densely lined book is filled with intricately wrought sentences like the above. This is fine if you are in the mood for a careful read, but in my tired Autumn mood I was not up to the challenge. In addition to the language, the story itself is also worthy of admiration. The story spans several generations, with one tale more incredible than the other. But there are so many characters and so many stories that somehow I ended up not able to root for any of the characters. And this was not because of their questionable deeds. I enjoy reading about characters who blur the lines between good and evil and cherish books that can give me insight into why ordinary people end up doing bad things. In this book there were simply too many and no real explanation for their deeds. When the main character finally came into the picture I had already had my fill of bizarre stories. I did feel some empathy towards his predicament, growing old twice as fast as other people, but not enough to really care about what happened to him. So although there is much to value in this book, for me it remained an objective admiration for a fine work of art. Only on rare moments did the book manage to captivate me or move me in any significant way. The next book I read is bound to be something completely different. ...more Rushdie offers a richly detailed family saga, full of passion and genius as well as secrets, lies and betrayals.

But between those two points Rushdie, in impeccable form, creates a fantastical exploration of Indian history, presents complex arguments about and descriptions of art, and questions the place and meaning of various religious affiliations on societies as a whole. The plot is a dazzling mechanism which plays like a modern fairy tale, while simultaneously developing many layers of subtext that enrich the reading experience immeasurably. The story is so clever and thought provoking I won't reveal it and rob others of the joy of discovering it themselves. I must admit there were a few overly ornate passages and the character of the art restorer, so crucial to the denouement, was woefully underdeveloped (which the author oddly writes into the narrative) adding to the hurried feel of the ending but overall these are fairly small criticisms. This was Rushdie's first novel after the fatwa was placed on him by Iran's Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini following the publication of The Satanic Verses; obviously he was able to use this terrible trial to great artistic ends. I certainly felt this was the best Rushdie novel I have yet read. ...more \u201cEven when people are telling their own life stories, they are invariably improving on the facts, rewriting their tales, or just plain making them up\u2026 the truth of such stories lies in what they reveal about the protagonists\u2019 hearts, rather than their deeds.\u201d (135) \u201cThere is nothing to be said of a Fact except that it is so. \u2013 For may one negotiate with a Fact, sir? \u2013 In no wise! \u2013 May one stretch it, shrink it, condemn it, beg its pardon?

Placed either side of his magnificent but not exactly lov Review of Shame and The Moor's Last Sigh Reading Rushdie after reading 'ordinary' books, the language hits you like a tidal wave. It is exagerated, overblown, long-winded and wonderful in its depth, variety and decadence. Rushdie's work flourishes on his bright, in-your-face love of language and of story-telling, something so joyous that it in some way negates, or balances, the simple tragedy and violent folly of these dark, vicious tales. Placed either side of his magnificent but not exactly lovable Satanic Verses, both Shame and The Moor's Last Sigh provide magical, epic family dramas of a much more readable and accesible form. These two very different forms of magical realism have much in common. Both follow the progress of rich and doomed families across generations (in Shame's case the friendships and frictions between two waring political families, in The Moor's Last Sigh a single, decadent merchant family and its slow fall into death and ruin) and both are written in a style that frequently crosses between reality and Rushdie's very flexible imagination. Both revel in words and wordplay, the magic of coincidence and the intrigue of tracing parallels and patterns through the generations, the magically repeating helix of narrative. Both offer a dark, hellish vision of their overlaying reality (Pakistan and Bombay) and both offer little in the way of happy endings or solutions. Shame is more scattered than the more linear narrative of The Moor's Last Sigh. It follows a dizzying array of characters and jumps around in time and place. The first person narrator remains unidentified throughout, a sly, sarcastic and jokey commentator on the events and lives of Iskander Harappa and Raza Hyder, two powerful men in a fractured Pakistan, and their families. The most memorable story is that of Hyder's daughter, the Beast Sufiya Zinobia, a retarded girl with an anger locked inside her capable of terrible and cathartic acts. Her marriage to Omar Khayyam, a overweight doctor who has until then lived a pleasure seeking life, sparks the final events of the book and Sufiya's transformation. It is an extremely violent and exciting finale, almost in the tradition of a Hollywood fright movie, and it works as the build up and release of all the titular \"shame\" that has piled up on the characters throughout the novel. Rushdie's very clever trick is the way he intentionally forgets Sufiya and her story. He is frequently sidetracked by other events and only returns sporadically to Sufiya, often with a question, and what about Sufiya Zinobia? For all their power and posturing, Iskander and Raza fade into the background of their own stories and their shame, manifested in the abused, captive Sufiya, rises slowly and inexorable as the novel nears its climax. The question comes thick and fast, what about Sufiya? so that we are constantly reminded and, despite the lack of screen time, when Shame reaches its close, it is her story we remember. Like a lot of Rushdie's work, fairytales, both east and west, abound and interlace his stories. Shame's obvious reference is Beauty and the Beast, but The Moor's Last Sigh is patchworked with them so completely that it becomes a bit of a treasure hunt of cultural references, from the old and traditional to modern cinema. There's the Snow Queen (eventual fairytale villian Miranda's needle in the heart), Rumpelstiltskin (Abraham's deal with his mother), lots of references to the Wizard of Oz (the female characters as witch figures, a gangster Tin Man) the Godfather (Abraham the criminal overlord) towers to be locked in, curses and family dooms. It's fascinating but at times a bit too much. Rushdie's obsession with tracking (and blaming) the entire geneology of the Moor's ancestors makes parts of the novel seem superfluous and long-winded. But the truth is everything fits into a very epic whole - in some ways Moor's Last Sigh feels like Rushdie's most ambitious and most realised book. It weaves in centuries of history, linking the Moor's fate with his mirrored historical counterpart in al-Andalus, Moorish Spanish. There is the sub-surface tracing of the story through Aurora's paintings, described and analysed in detail, as well as a more contemporary vision of an almost steampunk Bombay full of gang warfare and maniacal murderers and political plotters. It also manages to be simultaneously his easiest plot to follow and the most ambiguous - by the end of the novel elements of the plot are left to the reader's discretion, in particular the true nature of his relationship with his mother and the manipulative love interest, Uma, both wonderfully secretive and intriguing characters. The finale brings the father-figure to the fore, together with the various suspect lovers of his mother, into a thrilling and cinematic apocalytic ending, probably the most exciting 100 pages of a Rushdie novel. His vision of violence and anger in urban Bombay comes together in a rip-roaring, explosive conclusion. Rushdie dares an extended epilogue - a trippy, almost David Lynch style ending in Andalusia with new witch characters and fairytale snares, where the madness and the violent heritage of the Zogoiby family comes to a more intimately tragic, disturbing end. Interestingly, both of the main protagonists (Sufiya and the Moor) are out of step with time. Sufiya's mental age lags behind her body while the Moor ages at twice the normal pace. This allows for some very bizarre and sexually uncomfortable plots - particularly in the Moor's Last Sigh he treads a fine line and sometimes makes his strange clan of Zogoiby's a little too immoral, a little too taboo. In Shame it works better, Sufiya a very powerful representation of female repression and a fury waiting, needing, a release. The brick sillouette of Sufiya's escaped form, a Bertha in the attic let loose, is one of his finest and most thrilling images. The depth of these novels is incredible and, while they have their flaws and Rushdie has a habit of getting sidetracked from the plot frequently, that does allow him the space and time to amplify his themes and flaunt his unparalleled manipulation of language. Every reader would no doubt reveal new word games and references to other stories. On a basic narrative level, Shame and the Moor's Last Sigh are two very readable, magical realism epics with two briliantly executed and even fun endings that makes all the dense wading through family histories and words upon words very much worth the effort. 8 ...more The final chapters of the book, and the opening chapter, to which they loop back, are packed (or \u201cpalimpsested\u201d) with historical allusions.

It is hard to avoid the impression that all the left-over analogues of the Moor fable from Rushdie\u2019s notebooks have been poured into these chapters, which are as a result frantic and overwritten while elementary rules of fiction, like not introducing new characters in the last pages, are ignored. Rushdie pursues palimpsesting with considerable vigour in The Moor\u2019s Last Sigh, as a novelistic, historiographical, and autobiographical device. Thus Granada, Boabdil\u2019s lost capital, is also Bombay, \u201cinexhaustible Bombay of excess,\u201d the sighed-for home of Moraes as well as of the author over whose person he is written. Both are cities from which a regenerative cross-fertilization of cultures might have taken place, but for ethnic and religious intolerance. Like Midnight\u2019s Children (1981), Shame (1983), and The Satanic Verses (1989), The Moor\u2019s Last Sigh is a novel with large ambitions composed on a large scale. In its architecture, however, the Group found it disappointing. Aside from the dynastic prelude set in Cochin, and the last fifty pages set in Spain, the body of the book belongs to Moraes\u2019s life in Bombay. But instead of the interwoven development of character, theme, and action characteristic of the middle section of what might be called the classic novel, the middle section of Rushdie\u2019s novel makes only fitful and episodic progress. New actors are introduced with enough inventiveness and wealth of detail to justify major roles; yet all too often their contribution to the action turns out to be slight, and they slipped (or were slipped) out of the picture almost whimsically. It was also argued by some in the Group that those without a good knowledge of the history of the period both in Bombay and wider India would struggle with the narrative. To complaints of this kind\u2014which have been voiced with regard to the earlier books as well\u2014defenders of Rushdie have responded by arguing that he works, and should therefore be read, within two narrative traditions: of the Western novel (with its subgenre, the anti-novel \u00e0 la Tristram Shandy), and of Eastern story-cycles like the Panchatantra, with their chainlike linking of self-contained, shorter narratives. To such critics, Rushdie is a multicultural writer not merely in the weak sense of having roots in more than one culture but in the strong sense of using one literary tradition to renew another. It is not easy to counter this defence in its general form, particularly from the position of an outsider to India. But to take a single instance from The Moor\u2019s Last Sigh: the episode in which Moraes\u2019s father, Abraham Zogoiby, in a fit of enthusiasm for the modern, impersonal, \u201cmanagement\u201d style in business, adopts a young go-getter named Adam over Moraes as his son and heir. For some fifteen pages Adam occupies centre stage. Then he is dropped from the book. Most of the Group found the episode unsatisfying; further, we would hazard a guess that the reason why Adam disappears is not that Rushdie is following traditional Indian models but that he is only half-heartedly committed to satirizing the business-school ethos; he abandons this particular narrative strand because it is leading nowhere. Others disagreed, enjoying the stories of Adam and other personages who blazed briefly across the pages of The Moor\u2019s Last Sigh and then expired\u2026.

Premise The story is recounting of family history by Moraes Zogoiby affectionately called 'Moor' while in exile. Only son of Abraham Zogoiby and Aurora Da Gama , heiress to the vast and affluent spice trade business. Moor suffers from a peculiar condition because of which he ages twice the normal growth rate. The family saga is an exquisite tale of love,jealousy,hatred,bickering over the family fortunes, compassion and healing . The story follows the change in family fortunes from rich to filthy rich and the moral degradation of the family and it's fall from grace. Writing ,characters and backdrop This is my first rushdie and I am blown away. Tight paced narrative, flourish of beautiful language. This is the kind of writing which will dissuade or inspire an aspiring writer to pursue his dream of writing. His writing is delightful, refreshing and enchanting. The clever use of cuss words , Indianism adds a wonderful dimension to the whole book. The story focuses mainly during a tumultuous time in Indian history. Mainly the last 15 years before Independence and 20 years post independence.Rushdie is not kind to the British who ruled India and committed unspeakably atrocities and neither on Indian politicians. Rushdie slyly uses language to deceptively shield sharp,scathing and downright damning criticism of Indian politicians. Rushdie is \"in your face\" audacious writer who made damning statement about Nehru and co. Though most of it is true and I personally think Nehru becoming Prime Minister of independent India was the the biggest self inflicted curse. Much of the problems plaguing India can be traced back to nehru or indira gandhi and the subsequent generation of politicians. I think it was in a way good that Rushdie was away from India during this time being in hiding because of the fatwa. If he was in India I can imagine all hell would have broken loose. Okay after rambling on about Indian history so long let's move on. The character's created by Rushdie are all in some ways complex and flawed. They are all shades of gray. When one gets comfortable with the character and see them in positive light they surprise you with a cunning, mean and wicked streak. Aurora Da Gama falls in this criteria perfectly. A innocent child who loses her mother in early age but then commits a de facto murder. She taunts her children; abhors and despises her close friend . At the same time she in time's of need becomes a loving mother,caring,compassionate and kind lady.She tore the family apart but held it together too. All the character's are interesting, complex, baffling and add a lovely little zing to the storyline. Fox in lamb skin ? Though I like most part of the book , heck quite frankly I don't think there are any boring or loose ends. The tempo of the book also doesn't falter anywhere. BUT and this is a big but I do have certain negatives about Rushdie in the book. He describes 'Mr.India' the film as a third rate trashy affair and a rip off of star wars, with the actress clad in a wet sari as the only redeeming factor. I quite don't agree with him on this point. Agreed it was not a very insightful movie but the masses liked it and it was a huge hit. The movie was a huge hit at grassroot level. Maybe Rushdie likes art cinema but he has overstepped in criticism of the masses who liked it. Which begs me to ask the question 'Is he any better than the snobbish Brtish and Indian politicians, whom he criticized ? ' 'Is he perhaps just like the elite who look down upon the masses ?' But I don't hold this against him. 5 star rating holds. ...more<---C>Salman Rushdie</---C>", "Title": "The Moor's Last Sigh"},
