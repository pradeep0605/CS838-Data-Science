I wasn't even sure I was going to read it when I recently finished Throne of Glass and found it entertaining but a poor excuse for fantasy. You want to know what <+++>Crown of Midnight</+++> felt like? It was like the author listened to every piece of criticism I could have thrown at the first book, listened to everything I loved and everything that irritated me... and then wrote a perfect kind of book. The kind I wanted the first one to be; the kind I hadn't dared to hope she might produce in this sequel. There was more action,<---M> more nastiness</---M>, more character development, more surprises, more complications, more sexy, no love triangle - all of this and a well-placed, never-saw-it-coming twist.<---F> Ms Maas, consider me impressed</---F>. Crown of Midnight takes a huge step away from the tame romantic/bitchy drama of its predecessor and opens up a story that is a bigger, bloodier and meaner than I think many readers will be expecting. Celaena gets to fully explore all aspects of what it means to be an assassin in this book; she is tested constantly and you can see her growing and changing and learning as the story progresses. And this story is one tumultuous journey of extremely high ups and unbelievably low downs with Celaena taking relationships to all new levels and watching others fall apart. Old enemies resurface and we start to get a glimpse of just how big the picture Maas is painting for us actually is. One of the strengths of this book is having no idea how it's going to end. You might think that's a given, but Throne of Glass introduced us to a plot that was fairly easy to see mapped out. We are told of the challenges Celaena must compete in and win, we know that's what the book is moving towards, and it isn't too much of a leap to assume that (<---B>one way or another</---B>) Celaena is going to emerge victorious. Not in this book. This book starts with a blank slate, any mysteries or troubles that are to come are completely unknown to us - so every turn the plot takes is a surprise and every surprise is thrilling. I can't wrap my head around just how much better this sequel is. Maas has already grown as a writer and storyteller, making me wonder what she can possibly have in store for us next. The characters are also so much better developed in this book. Maas is brave enough here to allow the main characters to make mistakes, do the wrong things and test our ability to like them. Well, I don't know about you, but the new dimensions to their personalities, their faults and weaknesses, only served to make me like them more. Dorian surprised me most of all. In Throne of Glass , Dorian feels like something of a plot tool, a pretty little obstacle to Celaena and Chaol's romance. The scenes with him felt like filler between the parts I was actually waiting for. But not in Crown of Midnight ! In this, Dorian emerges as an interesting character with secrets of his own; he makes sacrifices for the people he loves and his importance to the bigger story starts to become apparent. In short? Throne of Glass ... Romance, love triangle, pretty dresses, one-dimensional characters, little action... Crown of Midnight ... Badassery, twists, nastiness, betrayal, more action, magic, secrets... If you were so-so about the first one and considering *maybe* reading this, you have my thumbs up. ...more Wow! This was an exceptional sequel. I loved it so much! I feel like the series has more of a direction, which is exciting. I'm still processing everything that happened in this book, because SO MUCH HAPPENS. I'll be doing a full review/discussion soooooon. I'm not sure what to do right now. I just.... wow. The only reason this isn't rated higher is because the first half was quite slow in pace and I wasn't as invested, but the second half SURE DID REMEDY THAT. Help me?

This is what I'd like to call a gorgeous sequel. Dare I say it, it might even top Throne of Glass ! Celaena Sardothien is doing her job as King's Champion, meaning she's killing people that stepped on the king's toes. And now she's got a new target: Archer Finn, former crush and friend from the time when she was within the Assassin\u2019s Guild. Turns out, she's not killing her targets, but faking their deaths, so she's in a lot of danger if someone discovers her secret. The stakes are higher now that Archer is a well-known figure in Rifthold and that he might be involved in a rebel group. To make events even more complicated, the half-Fae and long-dead Queen, Elena, is asking Celaena to find the source behind the King's power. \u201cEverything in this world is magic. Thank you ever so kindly for stating the obvious.\u201d Celaena was a goddamn badass. I wouldn't mess with her in a thousand years. We finally see her wild and deadly side, the one that I've grown accustomed to in the prequel e-novellas and that wasn't fully explored in Throne of Glass . Sure, she's still that sassy, arrogant and sarcastic girl, but above all, she's an assassin. A ruthless killer. And when the ones she loves are in danger or threatened, she's unforgiving. That part of her really gives you goosebumps. Oh, and let's not forget when she's in for revenge. One word: lethal. She was a whirlwind of steel and blood. As he watched her cut through the men like they were stalks of wheat in a field, he understood how she had gotten so close to touching Endovier\u2019s wall that day. And at last\u2014after all these months\u2014he saw the lethal predator he\u2019d expected to find in the mines. There was nothing human in her eyes, nothing remotely merciful. It froze his heart. Dorian Havilliard. Chaol Westfall. Dorian, Chaol, Chaol, Dorian. Chaol is the same sweet, loyal, funny, protective and fierce warrior. I loved his easy banter with Celaena and his alpha-male demeanor. Prince Dorian Havilliard is still the same passionate, kind, intelligent young man that is slowly transforming into a great ruler. And they\u2019re best friends! How can I choose?! *crying* \u201cI worry because I care. Gods help me, I know I shouldn't, but I do. So I will always tell you to be careful, because I will always care what happens.\u201d In Crown of Midnight , Chaol and Celaena are getting close. Like really close. And because of that, both of their relationships with Dorian become more strained, awkward and tense. And that's kind of the single thing that bothered me at Celaena: in Throne of Glass , she was all over Dorian... and now? She doesn't care about his feelings when he clearly loves her. And that just got me going mad. I wanted to hug Dorian several times and give him cookies. Still, things evolve a little bit between them on a platonic level when a heartbreaking twist makes Celaena not trust Chaol anymore. And another unexpected twist involving Dorian makes things one hundred times more interesting. \u201cWhen you do, I want you to remember that it wouldn\u2019t have made any difference to me. It\u2019s never made any difference to me when it came to you. I\u2019d still pick you. I\u2019ll always pick you.\u201d I've read some reviews that say that the love triangle's fate is sealed after the first quarter of the book. But now, after reading it, I'm not so sure. Especially after that second half and killer ending. I love Chaol with all my heart, but I can't help but hope that Celaena will end up with Dorian. Now, now, don't throw stones at me! It\u2019s still a Cinderella inspired book! They're both swoony guys, but I've always loved Dorian a bit more. Might be because of the dark-haired, blue-eyed appearance. And possibly the arrogance. And the bookish and funny personality. Perhaps even the fact that he's a freaking prince. *dreamy sigh* \u201cIf you are captured, if you are hurt, you are beyond our reach. You will be entirely on your own.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d \u201cBut I won\u2019t be. Every day that you\u2019re there, I will wonder what has become of you. I won\u2019t.... I won\u2019t forget you. Not for one hour.\u201d Nehemia was such a great support for Celaena, even if she had her own agenda. The princess is one of those selfless characters that would give everything up for the sake of her people. She's fair, ambitious and dedicated. And she's the key-player that sets things in motion in this sequel. But in a gut-wrenching method that will surely have you shedding a few tears. The villain we love to hate: the King of Adarlan, Dorian's father. His plans turn out to be down-right evil and unnatural. I loathe that guy because he's so willing to exploit everyone around him for his own sake. I want him D.E.A.D. *guilty smile* As it was to be expected, we meet new characters. My favorite was Mort. Why? First of all, he's an ancient talking door knocker. Second of all, he's hilarious! When they left, Nehemia spent a few minutes studying Mort\u2014 mostly asking him questions about his creation spell, which he claimed to have forgotten, then claimed was too private, then claimed she had no business hearing. Archer Finn was hard to read, but I never trusted him behind all those pretty smiles and coward-like behavior. Never trust a courtesan. Oh, and of course, there's Baba Yellowlegs. Even the name gives you creeps. She's an old, manipulative witch whose favorite meal is consisted of young girls. Told you: creepy. The character development is really spectacular. You can see how Celaena, Chaol and Dorian grow. By the end of the novel, our heroine is not running from her past anymore; the Captain of the Guard is ready to sacrifice himself and face his father; and the Crown Prince starts to stand up to the King no matter the consequences. \u201cThank you for all that you have done for me, Dorian. Thank you for being my friend. For not being like the others.\u201d The pace was definitely action driven. I'm not kidding when I'm saying that sooo much happened and some many plots started to unfold between my eyes. Crown of Midnight was a page-turner through and through and there was never a dull moment. \u201cHow long will you keep her here?\u201d Dorian said, looking down the stairs. She had attacked the Captain of the Guard in front of his men. Worse than attacked. \u201cAs long as it takes,\u201d Chaol said quietly. \"For what?\u201d \u201cFor her to decide not to kill us all.\u201d Another think that surprised me was the fact that Celaena is keeping so many secrets I can't even keep count. There were two revelations regarding her: I suspected the one revealed in the end, but the other one totally caught me unprepared. Both are jaw-dropping twists that will completely change the outcome of her adventures. \u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll come back for you.\u201d The world-building was exquisite! We learn so much more about Erilea, Adarlan and the history of the country. We delve deeper into the Fae magic. It's a top-notch high fantasy world, coupled with a darker atmosphere, mistery, magic and amazing characters. The result is a certain recipe for epicness, one that Sarah J. Mass gorgeously created with her mad writing skills. If you haven't started this series, I'm begging you -- pick it up ASAP . It's complex, emotional and completely captivating. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll swoon, you'll gasp in shock and you'll fall in love with the story. Crown of Midnight was an excellent follow-up that might not end in a claw-your-yes-out sort of cliffhanger, but it will make you crave the next installment like air. And man, what a ride that will be! *wink* ENJOY!<3 You can also read this review here: http://raftul-cartilor-vampiresti.blo... .......................................... I NEED THIS BOOK!!!

Our heroine is back as the King's Champion so expect action galore. Hear ye, hear ye . . . Her lovely dresses and ornate clothes were gone, replaced with an unforgiving, close-cut black tunic and pants. Her hair pulled back in a long braid that fell into the folds of that dark cloak she was always wearing. She was a beautiful wrath \u2026 This book turned up in my room dressed in dark robes, whispered the first few sentences like a secret incantation and before I could utter 'By the Wyrd' I was under its spell (not saying that this book has magical powers, but this book has magical powers . . . in fact I'm pretty sure <---A>Sarah J. Maas</---A> is Fae). It swept me down a path of ink and words, and every time I thought it had given me its all, 'surely it can't get better than this . . . surely,' it would open its robes to unveil yet more wondrous things. Then it took a boot to my love for female assassins and pushed hard and now I'm sitting at the bottom of a canyon singing to myself: O' hither she came , and stole my heart, henceforth I shall never be the same, your jewels to her you will part, or so is the King's claim, a jewelley thief? O' she played it smart, she is of much greater fame, your body she will cart, this deadly daggered dame, your name you will never part, before she takes her aim. (You're writing it love poetry? Really Mara, REALLY?) Characters: I've already made my adoration towards Celaena quite clear so I'd like to take a moment to appreciate our two leading men: Chaol (still firmly Team Shirtless Chaol) and Dorian (and I wouldn't mind seeing him shirtless too). Chaol , Chaol, wherefore art thou Chaol? I am, as we speak, arranging to become a fictional character so I can stalk meet you. The Captain of the Guard is as strong and fierce as he was in ToG but in this installment we get to see more of his softer side. The beautiful friendship between Celaena and him takes front stage in CoM. Sarah really takes the opportunity to flesh out their relationship in all it's banter-teasing-tension glory. There's talk of books (sigh) and late nights spent next to the fireplace. While Chaol's compassion and loyalty are beacons of light in the darkness of the Royal Court, the question is where exactly do his loyalties lie? With the Crown he has fought so hard to protect? Or with his friends who have made the glass castle a home for him? \"Why are you crying?\" \"Because,\" she whispered, her voice shaking, \"you remind me of how the world ought to be. What the world can be.\" Then there is Dorian our charming prince. But again Sarah sucker punches stereotypes and leaves them panting for breath on the floor. Dorian isn't your garden variety indestructible, white horse riding, fierce, saves-the-day prince. Instead he can be fragile and confused and he is made all the more strong for it. Shocking isn't it that boys can experience the same emotions as female heroines (cough) ?\u00a0Sarah doesn't kick him to the curb either. Rather another layer of mystery is added when strange things start happening to him . . . things that put his life at risk. The most refreshing aspect of this trio's relationship is that Celaena is not turned into a Mary Sue mess in the face of these male \"interests.\" Four for you Sarah J. Maas. I am not at all done with these characters and I'm ready for their next adventure. CoM had it all: magic, adventure, epic fights, romance, mystery and secrets . . . so many dirty little secrets that aren't as neatly tucked into the nooks and crannies of the Royal Court as their owners would like to think. The ending left me as hungry for more as when I started. This series is going to go wondrous places in the next instalment and I can barely wait. _____________________________ PRE-REVIEW: 30/09/2012: 2013?! No no no no no. Why are you so far away?! 2013 is finally here! I just can't. Okay? I need me some more Dorian and Chaol. Pweeeeaaaaase? Be strong my shipper heart. Dear lord wilt thou not grant patience to my poor shipper heart?! Team shirtless Chaol. ...more HOLY JESUS THIS WAS SO GOOD. I NEED THE NEXT ONE NOOOOOOW. Also, I appreciate the fact that this is not going to be a trilogy, we need more fantasy SERIES in the young adult genre. And Chaol <3 WELL BLOW ME AWAY. I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING, well actually some of it, like C heritage I saw coming. BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO PEOPLE IN THIS BOOK WAS OMG SERIOUSLY ITS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.

Now I'm ready. 4.5 stars Reviewed by: Rabid Reads Ten(ish) years ago, before the explosion of hair removal services, I used to go to this tiny South Korean lady who rented a space in a nearby salon. The moment she got me in her room, she'd keep up a constant stream of very bad English. The only thing she said that I could understand was, \"Oh my GAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH.\" This was also her favorite thing to say, so I heard it a lot . That's how I feel after finishing this book. Oh my\u00a0GAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH. Throne of Glass is one of my favorite series right now. It's probably my #1 favorite YA series, and it's also the only one of my favorite YA series that isn't ending sometime this year---WOOT. So, of course, after loving the first book so much, I was worried about book 2. How could it possibly live up to its predecessor? But\u00a0what I learned about\u00a0Sarah J. Maas is that she is not\u00a0a one trick pony, b/c Crown of Midnight was one of those perfect second installments. Everything was more. Celaena was more kick-ass. Chaol was more swoonworthy. The King was more vile. There was more action, more betrayal, more heartbreak---just more . Celaena is now the King's Champion, having killed (HA!) it in the competition (like we knew she would). But trained assassin or not, she of course has issues with her new job title. The King is responsible for the death of her entire COUNTRY (not to mention her immediate family) after all, so does she like being his personal, one-woman hit-squad? Not so much. But the King warned her that if she didn't toe the line, he'd kill everyone she cares about---Chaol, Nehemia, Nehemia's family, probably her dog too, b/c he's just that kind of bastard . . . so what's a girl to do? Plot and scheme, that's what. But she's not the only one, and up until the half-way point, this ominous feeling kept building and building. Nothing bad was happening yet , but everyone kept making bad decision after bad decision. Little things that kept up a steady flow of dread , b/c I\u00a0knew that those little things were going to eventually combine to form a great, big whole. I\u00a0knew something was coming, I\u00a0just didn't know what. Then, suddenly, I was\u00a0too happy to be bothered with silly, little things like bad feelings . But a storm was coming, and that \"happy place\" was just the eye, meant to lull you\u00a0into a false sense of security . . . And then the Bad Thing happened. Which caused the Even Worse Thing to happen. And I'm not gonna lie, it was T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E. And then you start to cope. And just when you start to get your land-legs back, you get your mind friggin' blown. Anyone who was kind of on the fence about this series will get most, if not ALL, of their\u00a0questions answered in this installment. And as terrible as the terrible things were (and man , they were terrible), Maas somehow managed to not only end on a hopeful note, but to also have me dying for the next installment the way the absolute worst kind of\u00a0cliffhanger will have me dying for the next installment . . . but without the cliffhanger . . . How did she do that? I don't know. What I do know is that I can't get my hands on Heir of Fire , coming to you September 2, 2014, soon enough.

Sarah J. Maas has done something, something with her writing that has now captured my heart and owns it. Her writing is phenomenal, and knowing how much improvement was actually made, I can already tell HoF and QoS will be phenomenal as well. Crown of Midnight had its own improvements in everything - Celaena became more badass, more secrets were made and kept and also found, more violence and blood, more heartbreaks and more betrayals. Throne of Glass was a novel I quite enjoyed and actually liked, while many others did not find appealing or liked it in any way. But if someone wasn't so sure about ToG, well, CoM will definitely leave you wanting to read the rest of the series and see where Celaena's journey takes you. Sarah J. Maas definitely took this to another level. Nothing was the same, everything changed. Everything that was not expected happened. I knew there would be character development, but I didn't expect this much! Celaena Sardothien is not the same Celaena we meet in Throne of Glass. No. In Throne of Glass she was known as an assassin that was pretty sarcastic and weak at many times, but in Crown of Midnight, she's still that sarcastic woman, but she's also an actual assassin now. She's aggressive, badass, and a vicious heroine that doesn't let her loved ones attackers stay alive without her questions being answered. I know this is off topic, but damn! Celaena reminded me of this anime called Fairy Tail. It's basically a fantasy anime that deals with magic and guild and the main one is called Fairy Tail. They're a guild that fight and live for their comrades , for their friends , for their family. For some reason, I was reminded of that. Celaena's dark side is actually revealed to us and we see someone who is fighting for her friend, someone she thought she would never have. She's fighting for her, to find answers, to look for them and answer her own questions with other's questions and answers. Hell! Celaena's character development was the one I've been waiting for! I haven't really read books with vicious heroines that deal with death and assassination and now reading about Celaena, my whole life has made a turn and she is my book soul mate. I was crying when she felt tears and just held them back. I was crying for the pain she felt. I was crying for the loss she lost. I was crying for what she had to do when she didn't want to. I was crying for her. I never thought I would become a fan of Sarah J. Maas for some reason. I never wanted to pick this series up because of the negative reviews I read about the first one and because of the love-triangles. I just didn't care about it. And now look at where I am. Crying, trying to find the words to write an actual review and not just this pointless one. Here I am loving Sarah but hating her at the same time for leaving me with a shattered broken small heart. But hey, there's 2 other books for a reason right? Minus the 3rd one... This being a fast-paced book, there is development in everything. We are introduced to some new characters (which I really don't focus on while writing reviews) and we are met with the same ones, only secrets hiding in them as well. Let's see, where do I start. Chaol and Dorian. Oh my beloved handsome Prince Dorian Havilliard and my precious small yet big cinnamon roll, Chaol Westfall. I really don't know who has ruined my life more. They're best friends, they both have feelings for the same girl, and they both have their secrets to be told. Dorian is still that handsome, intelligent and charming Prince that cares about Celaena and keeps a distance away from her. Chaol is still the Captain of the Guard not only for Dorian, but for Celaena as well, keeping no distance away from her and finally allowing himself into accepting that he loves the same woman his loyal friend does. He still cares about Dorian but because of his distance with Celaena and sharing a romance with her, their friendship kind of fades and it's not the same like it was in ToG. In Throne of Glass, I was all about Dorian. I accepted him as my book boyfriend along with many other readers and I accepted his connection with Celaena while I did not accept her connection with Chaol. I did not hate Chaol, rather I was glad he was the guard that followed the commands of his King and friend, and didn't really care much about Celaena. But in Crown of Midnight, everything changes. He starts caring for her and noticing he actually loves her in a way he never thought he would. Even though he knew it would affect his friendship with Dorian, he couldn't keep the far distance from Celaena and not allowing himself to touch her and kiss her. With the romance building up, Celaena and Dorian kept a small distance apart and she didn't care much about him when he truly still loved her and cared for her. It made me so sad and all I really wanted was for Celaena and Dorian to be together. But now, now I don't even know what team I'm on. Team Chaolaena or Team Dorlaena but at the same time, I don't want any of them to be together simply because I prefer for Dorian and Chaol to be happy as friends and stay that way, not get mad at each other, fighting for the same girl. A guard and a loyal friend since they were young, oh please stay that way instead. But then, Maas decides to make some plot twists and leave my world hanging because I didn't expected any of it until it actually happened. I was captivated by the challenges Celaena had to make, the secrets she had to keep, and the truths she had to find. Not having a clue how it would actually start before it started, how the twits would appear, and how the end would end , I was surprised by how much I actually loved this sequel and mark it as one of my favorites. Many things change, leaving me wanting to pick up the 3rd book to see how the past is left by everyone: how Celaena regains her title and starts her new journey while seeking a new path; how Chaol will face his father and accept the offer he has made; how Dorian is ready to accept his Father for the ugly King he is. When I say so much happened, I mean, a shit load happened! The ending, everything really, just let my eyes with liquid, letting it roll down my cheeks and have emotional and mixed feelings everywhere. CoW was dark, bloody, violent and pretty brutal. Celaena wasn't afraid to kill for her loved ones, she wasn't afraid to keep following the King's orders to keep gaining her freedom. Nothing from her past was in her anymore as the novel ended. She grows to her darker side, oaths to keep one promise and only that one, knows who she is, and just wants to seek the revenge for what happened to her friend, her actual friend. I'm looking forward to where Aelin Gala- I mean Celaena Sardothien decides to go to and take me along with her mysterious journey, to see who she builds another connection with, to see who she comes upon with, to see the choices and other challenges she will have to make, to see where everything will take place and end. ...more Nooooo, Dorian . *Hugs him till Celaena loves him* I want to prove a point.

For now) I love how the \"magic\" in this world had much more of a presence in CoM than in the books that came before it. It made this book feel much more like a high fantasy read than the others, and I am VERY PLEASED with that. Especially the part at the end when she went all super sayain on the demon from the portal. That was awesome :) Also very satisfying ending with Archer (who ironically never once wielded a bow and arrow). Definitely my favorite from this series so far! (3 down, 2 to go...

That was awesome :) Also very satisfying ending with Archer (who ironically never once wielded a bow and arrow). I never liked that guy. It did get a bit slow in the middle when Celaena was going through her deep dark depression, but the kick ass ending totally made up for that! I want more! I think I might just jump straight into HoF now. I want to see what this kingdom is like where magic and the Fae still exist. Also, I want to know what the hell is going on with Dorian bursting with magic powers all of a sudden. Is he a sorcerer or something? Why does he have powers? His dad doesn't, does he? But yeah he's like an avatar now, with power over earth, snow, fire, and air, which is freaking cool! Even with that said though, I feel like Dorian had a much more subdued role in this one. The focus was definitely more on Chaol (who Celaena needs to just forgive already. It wasn't the poor guy's fault Nehemia got killed, okay!). And while I'm glad we got to see different sides of Chaol's character, I really hope Dorian is more like he was in the first book in HoF and less like angsty Harry Potter from OotP trying to keep his powers under control. Also what the hell when the ancient ghost king came to him in a dream and told him to go save Celaena from the portal she opened?? Smells like deus ex machina. Okay, I think that's all I have to say about CoM. I really really liked it and I would love to read you guys' thoughts on it too :) And also I really hope Celaena goes beast Fae mode again in HoF since magic should still work in Wendlyn XD Okayiloveyoubye! ...more This book was just pure fun and excitement; it is not without a lot of flaws, but overall, my enjoyment of the plot propelled it into a highly satisfying read.

I have to swallow my words when it comes to this series; I did bash on the first book in this series a lot because it was so similar to one of my favorite books. Due to my prejudice, I did not much like the first book in this series. It was an enjoyable read, but the characters were too lacking in depth for me, and the entire book just lacked a certain something that would otherwise make it shine, make it memorable. With that said, I loved this book. This is an excellent, excellent sequel; I love being surprised, I love being proved wrong in my pessimism about a book, and Crown of Midnight turned out to be so much more enjoyable than I thought it would be. There is no second-book syndrome here. It is not without its flaws by any means. Celaena remains perfectly...well, perfect, for the most part. The love triangle is persistent and painful, and at more than one point, I wanted to take Dorian and Chaol and just bash their heads together . However, every single character mature and develops, and I did make up my mind as to whom I prefer before the book is over. A complaint I often have in fast-paced plots is that, interestingly enough, they're often so boring despite everything. This was not the case for this book; from the very beginning, I was hooked. The action rarely stops, and even in the quieter, more introspective moments, I never find myself yawning. I finished this book in 2 sittings, rarely finding myself switching books in-between. Given my highly ADHD book-reading personality, this says something about my enjoyment of it and its ability to keep me constantly engrossed. The plot : fast-paced, completely immersing . The plot twists and turns are just interesting enough to keep me absorbed, and are never too far-fetched that they would stretch the boundaries of my disbelief. I absolutely loved it. It was never bogged down by too many flashbacks, the main narrative is Celaena's, alternately Dorian and Chaol's. Their narratives, particularly those of Chaol's, were more on the introspective side, but never bored me, and were short enough so that it did not slow down the rapid pacing of the book. The writing is great; actions scenes were well-done, the dialogue is believable, the verbal style is descriptive and flows well without ever coming close to purple prose. Celaena : My main problem with her in the first book is that Celaena is too perfect. That problem still persists largely in this book, but I found it more tolerable, in part because she breaks down . That's right, our rational, cool-headed, perfectly calm Celaena finally breaks down---and I loved it. She has her Bella Swan moment, and for once, I have no complaints . She literally does not eat, does not bathe. She cries, she is prostate with grief...and it was awesome. I loved seeing her being emotional, I loved seeing her break through her tough outer shell. I loved seeing her come out of it. A familiar, dark fire rippled in her gut, spreading through her, dragging her down into an abyss without end. Celaena Sardothien stood from her chair. I fucking stood up from my chair and shouted \"YEAH,\" at this scene. It is fleeting, in the grand scale of the book, and I do wish she had more moments of vulnerability, of still more development that would make me relate to her more as a character, but I'll take what I can get. Celaena's other fault is not her own...not so much as the author's. The author seems to shy away from the idea that Celaena is an assassin . For a king's assassin, she makes Celaena one in name only . Celaena does not act like an assassin. She only kills when she absolutely has to---by accident, almost. Celaena is not so much an assassin as an investigator, a detective, someone caught in the fray in the middle of a desperate fight who has to kill or be killed. Right at the beginning of the book, Celaena reveals to us that she does not actually kill her targets, but instead helps them to escape. I think this is meant to make us empathize with Celaena as a character, to make her more human. It just makes me respect her less . It's a book about an assassin. I expect an assassin to kill . If I wanted to read a mystery novel, I'd go get one. Give me my fucking assassin, dammit. Celaena doesn't act too smart sometimes, for me, she acts rather foolishly. She trusts people with too much more information than I was comfortable with, despite everything, she still acts more naive than I would expect of someone so seemingly competent. Her actions aren't without consequence, if found out, she could endanger the lives of so many, and she seems to disregard that. There is one plot twist within this book that I desperately, desperately hate. It launches Celaena from mildly perfect right smack into the middle of a Mary Sue stereotype. Ugh. We'll see how that goes. Dorian : for a large part of the book, Dorian is...let's face it...a huge fucking pussy . He doesn't stand up to his father, the king. He is largely passive. He spends the majority of the time resentfully angry at the developing relationship between Celaena and Chaol and whining and not doing much about it besides mope. He is depressed about the fact that Celaena is no longer his pretty pretty assassin-to-be in lovely dresses---and could be, in fact, a cold-blooded killer. Which he knows she is. But he's still shocked. Just SHOCKED. Sigh. Her lovely dresses and ornate clothes were gone, replaced by an unforgiving, close-cut black tunic and pants, her hair pulled back in a long braid that fell into the folds of that dark cloak she was always wearing. She was a beautiful wraith---and when she looked at him, it was like she didn\u2019t even know who he was. He couldn\u2019t help wondering if he\u2019d ever meant anything to Celaena at all. Get over yourself, Dorian! Dorian's character does improve for the better...eventually. It takes a while. Actually, a long while. A teenaged girl could get a lesson or two from Dorian about how to mope. Overall, I do think his character development was one of the better ones depicted within this book. If I had to pick a side, I'd be on Team Dorian for sure. Chaol : I may be showing a definite bias here, but Chaol can go screw himself . PURELY OBJECTIVE, OF COURSE. He worries so goddamn much. He has no trust in Celaena's abilities to take care of herself. He acts more like her goddamn mother (who's dead, but whatever) than a potential love interest. This dress, with its close-fitting bodice, long, tight sleeves, and gently flowing skirt, was about as new and different as it came. Which was why, when she ran into Chaol on her way out of her rooms, she wasn\u2019t very surprised when he stopped dead and blinked. Then blinked again. Chaol stood in the hallway, his bronze eyes traveling down the front of her dress, then up again. \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing that.\u201d Ok, mom. I hate his constant worrying and fussing over her; it shows a lack of trust, it shows a lack of confidence. Despite Celaena's obvious competence, Chaol hides things from her, he constantly berates her, and basically never trusts her to do her own fucking job . I'm just a little biased. Grumble. Fine. He's really not that bad overall. But I still prefer Dorian. The love triangle : I'm not exaggerating about the continued love triangle here, but I have to admit, it wasn't that bad. The emotions were well-done, the indecisions and internal conflicts were well-depicted, and this is one of the better triangles I've seen within a book. Dare I say it? I like it, and I'm glad that the triangle continues. It makes things interesting, even though if Celaena ever makes a choice and it's the wrong one (according to my opinion, of course), this reader will be very, very upset. Overall: a highly enjoyable book, and goddamn, I have to wait how long until the next? ...more 2.5 stars Answer me something.

(Fun fact: Calaena finally acts like a real assassin in this installment) But leaving her post to dance ? I'm going to say it one more time to let it sink in. The world's greatest assassin left. Her. Fucking. Post. To. Dance. It's such a transparent attempt to squeeze in a moonlit waltz between Chaol and Calaena, I want to laugh. I'm Team Dorian, by the way. Just putting that out there. Chaol is an overprotective fucknuckle who can suck it. Calaena still does stupid crap, like exploring without backup or sufficient research. Her obsession with chocolate cake is goddamn annoying. It's too cutesy and feels like Maas's trying too hard. Each time it came up, I felt like paraphrasing Amy from Gone Girl : No one fucking likes chocolate cake that much. Midway, as I was finally warming up to Calaena, she turns into an uber Mary Sue. (view spoiler) [She's part Fae, the lost queen of Terrasen, and has magical powers. For fuck's sake. Choose one, Maas. Don't be greedy. (hide spoiler) ] I originally warmed up to Calaena because of Maas's excellent portrayal of loss and depression. It's not resolved in a chapter or two; it's an underlining theme that affects the latter half of the book. I especially like that (view spoiler) [Calaena doesn't forgive Chaol right away. Nehemia dying wasn't his fault, but her anger and distrust is justified. (hide spoiler) ] I also liked Dorian's (view spoiler) [magic (hide spoiler) ] subplot. It's one of the few things in Crown of Midnight that made me sit up, and partially why I think he'd be good with Calaena: ice and fire. He's a way better love interest and friend. I don't care if it's planet-aligning true love, you don't sneak around with your best friend's ex-girlfriend. *cough*Chaol*cough* I especially like the part where Dorian sees them dancing and chooses to let her go. It was a sweet, poignant moment. And put me firmly on his side, even though I'm destined to lose. Ah, well. A Court of Thorns and Roses is amazing and I will definitely check out anything else Maas writes, but this series is a disappointing mess.

Now that it is out in the open let me start my fangirling and tell you good people that this book rocks so much. I love, love it. There is still this fierce woman but this time shows her vulnerable side. That despite her strong appearance there is still fragile, lost girl inside. I liked how the book showed it to me. If you are those readers who wanted to learn more about Celaena\u2019s background, you\u2019re in luck because the book tell us her past that truly surprised me (and probably you guys too). Not only her, even Chaol\u2019s and Dorian\u2019s secrets and past were revealed here and I got to know more about them. Also, now being the Champion, her work truly does come with danger now that she is under the king\u2019s radar. At the same time she now deals with suspicious people who confused her with her decisions. She doesn\u2019t know which one are which\u2014which ones to trust. Yes, Chaol included. And with that I\u2019m going to speak about the captain of the guard, the character that has captured a lot of readers\u2019 heart, Chaol Westfall (a very mouthful introduction but it is proper to introduce him in such way *winks*). Did I get the Chaol I\u2019ve been wishing for since the first book ended? Heck yeah, I did and a whole lot more. To say that their relationship took more than just a fair development is just a tip of the iceberg. A lot happened between them: the good, that bad, and the awesomes. But let me start with the awesome first, the way their relationship has developed is just graceful. It makes me so much happy that it is more than the shallow reasons that they have reached to that point. Just lovely. So for the not so good part, what just upset me is that despite her saying that she trust him, that she feels at home with him, she can give him up quickly and even endanger his life...by her own hands. It just\u2026upset me. I know (and I\u2019ll vaguely explain it to avoid spoiling you--too much already) that what he did helped the situation happened. I still think it was irrational and quite impulsive for her to reach that decision of risking his life. I know she was mad about it and I know it was terrifying. But for someone she thinks so highly, she doesn\u2019t even value him the way she should. I\u2019m glad Chaol understands her. It hurt him to have added to the cause of her pain. But the scene in the end gives me so much hope for the two. It pretty obvious what is going on (even Dorian said so) and I believe Celaena has clearer mind this time around. I have no doubts that those people, who like me love this series, loved the first book will not be disappointed with this one. I don\u2019t know how to wrap it up so I\u2019ll end it with these quotes: \u201cI would be the greatest fool in the world to let you go alone.\u201d \u2013 Chaol \u201cyou remind me of how the world ought to be.

Let me retract that statement for a moment and add a little disclaimer... I\u2019ll say this now, and I\u2019ll say it again. Sarah J Maas is not an author for everyone. She is not the author for the light hearted. She\u2019s not the author for you if you have a hard time seeing beloved characters get torn apart, ripped into, and stripped bare. Her characters change, grow, and this normally means they will hit rock bottom first. Maybe even more than once. They will make decisions that literally hurt your heart. Please go into this book AND the next one expecting that. All that to say- in my opinion, by the time she\u2019s done, she\u2019s built something much stronger than your average run of the mill character development. Lastly, in no way am I trying to insult anyone that doesn't love SJM's style. Reading is a hobby, and you should read what feels right for you. Sometimes difficult subjects like these hit too close to home or are too emotional- or just not enjoyable for every reader. Few last thoughts on this particular book ...and the characters that have sunken so deep into my soul... I had a hard time connecting with Celaena at first- until I really started to understand her in later books. She did some things in this book out of her absolute pain and misery that broke my heart - but once you realize why she's reacting that way, I think you'll feel nothing but sorrow for her. Not only that but she begins her huge character-arc journey here, in this book. It was heartbreaking to watch but the result is beautiful throughout the rest of the series. Chaol... Dorian... I can't tell you guys how much I adore these dudes. Chaol is so loyal and sweet. Yes he makes a mistake in this book (as people do...) but his character remains true. He's only ever trying go do what is right- but he struggles with the position he's been given. Dorian... he's just a ray of sunshine. He might be my favorite character in the entire series. The plot is so full of clues from the past and hints towards the future. Nothing is surface level. Pay attention to the details if you're reading this for the first time. So all claps for SJM who sent me through a wild ride of emotions. I adore this series to death (yes I've already read and ADORED all 4 books so far). The characters have so many layers and very rarely are black and white. My Blog ~ Instagram ...more Holy crap, that was good. And I'm an idiot for not reading these sooner.

After reading Throne of Glass the first time, I didn't pick this up and wasn't in a hurry to read it. Thankfully, some lovely friends of mine told me I HAD to read the sequels... In my experience, the second book in a series is almost always worse than the first so I didn't have high hopes for this installment at all, but thankfully the author proved me wrong! HOLY SHIT GUYS. Crown of Midnight was everything I wanted its predecessor to be. Everything that had pissed me off in the first book, was rectified, including Celaena being an arrogant bitch for no reason - oh, she is still arrogant in this book but we get so much more development, her reasons for being arrogant are somewhat justified. There is more action, more excitement, more twists, more character development and everything about this was just wonderful. Oh, and smut. There is much more smut (and no love triangle) AND IT WAS GREAT. Chaol, you sexy man. The plot was thrilling, exciting and I had no idea what to expect. Unfolding the mysteries that lie within the castle was intriguing and one of my favourite parts of the book. Actually, scratch that, every part of Crown of Midnight was my favourite part of the book. I felt like my heart was going to burst every time something major happened because the action and drama is never-ending . It's also full blown 'my heart is beating so fucking fast from anticipation and excitement' , I was so engrossed and I felt like I needed to take a break a few times because my emotions were all over the place, but I couldn't put the book down. So I enjoyed my suffering. This book doesn't do things half-assed and on a scale of 1-10 for any emotion felt during reading, it's all 10. In this installment, you see Celaena grow so much as a character and as I said earlier, her arrogance is much more justified. While I am still firmly on Team Chaol, Dorian grew so much and unlike the first book, I found myself actually caring about him as a character. We discover Dorian has secrets of his own, and he seems like so much more of an important aspect to the story now, and I can't wait to see how it pans out. You even get to know the King somewhat in this installment, which by the way was simultaneously awesome and terrifying. I don't know how much more I can go on about this book because it's still hard for me to form coherent thoughts about it. All I can say is this; if you didn't like Throne of Glass all that much like I did , please consider this. It's like an entirely new series. I didn't think a sequel could be so much better , it's incredible. Although I haven't yet read the novellas or Heir of Fire onward, this installment is definitely worth the read. I was up until 3am and felt like I was riding a fucking roller coaster but couldn't get off. This book just kicks ass and I'm so glad I have the next book waiting for me. ...more My mind is blown away. I didn't expect to feel the way I do after reading the last pages. The last few pages of the book made my heart race and gave me goosebumps all over. From the beginning and up until half of the book I was all like \"okay, a nice follow-up to Throne of Glass\" and then it all went to hell, it was like the first half of the book was a storm brewing up and then that storm broke out and shit went down, alright. As for the characters, they remain just as amazing as in the first no My mind is blown away. I didn't expect to feel the way I do after reading the last pages.

As for the characters, they remain just as amazing as in the first novel in the series and even more so. I actually bonded with the characters, and I find it an excellent idea for this series to be multi-pov and get insight of what all of our characters think about. Celaena is still the badass she used to be, a forged assassin made to bend everyone and everything to their knees. I love the presentation of her as a hollowed out human shell when she's fighting, it makes that much more.. uhmm, special. Chaol. What is there to be said about our wonderful, loving, caring Chaol, who can be just as controlling as Celaena, and they fit all too well at that, and many more. Their chemistry is all over the place. The fact that they have this love-hate relationship that just keeps getting kickstarted, it makes me love them that much more. Dorian, he evolved a lot, and despite his heartbroken status, he is not annoying (thank you Sarah for that) and there is lots of juice regarding that one. Including something you won't see coming. The book, after the first half, is a never ending plot twist. The ending is breathtaking. If you've read the first book and loved it then don't think twice about reading this, you may end up loving this even more. This series has definitely grown on to me and I can't wait to read about what's to come. I'm so glad there's already a published sequel! ...more Updated thoughts from my re-read before Empire of Storms are all below! Original review: HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?! You win. All of you. You were right. This series is everything . I read Throne of Glass last year and was pretty unimpressed.

I don't even know how I ended up giving this series another shot, but pretty sure I'm chalking that up to one of the best life choices Updated thoughts from my re-read before Empire of Storms are all below! Original review: HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?! You win. All of you. You were right. This series is everything . I read Throne of Glass last year and was pretty unimpressed. I shoved the series in a corner of my bookshelf and tried to ignore the massive hype around these books in the book community. I don't even know how I ended up giving this series another shot, but pretty sure I'm chalking that up to one of the best life choices I've ever made. Let me just say -- I get the hype now . I think I just got a new favorite series/obsession. And everything that annoyed me in the first book is completely gone! Celaena or whatever I'm supposed to call her dropped the high school mean girl act and is legitimately badass now. This book was totally everything I wanted from Throne of Glass but didn't get. The writing is a million times better, the execution is amazing, EVERYTHING IS PERFECT. It took me forever to read because I kept staring at it in shock like how is every single page this good ?!?! Whyyyy did it take me so long to read this?! I knew most of the plot points already because there is just no avoiding this fandom, but that actually didn't ruin anything. This seriously might be one of my top 10 favorite books of all time. Absolutely every part of the plot was perfect. There is NOTHING that I didn't like about it... like I seriously have nothing bad to say. I want to pick up the next book, but will probably just sit here in stunned silence for a bit. ____________________________________ Updates : Seriously read The Assassin's Blade before this book! It is a million times more emotional after that and Celaena's reactions make WAY more sense. And totally broke my heart. But I'm still not even going to try to summarize the plot here because the way it all gets unveiled is perfect. But seriously, HOW IS THIS BOOK SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE?!! Oh my goodness. I was fangirling the whole way through because the character development in this is AMAZING. And the plot arc and pacing are incredible... everything comes together so well . It's like the perfect balance of romance, action, suspense, mystery, awesome fantasy stuff, and drama. The part that totally sold me on this series was that scene under the (view spoiler) [library/clocktower (hide spoiler) ] that ends with the line \"There was a scrape of nail against stone, and then the sound of breathing. It was not her own.\" I love that Celaena becomes so much stronger in this book, yet also feels like she's at a weaker/more vulnerable point because she's trying so hard to fight for a good future without acknowledging the inevitable path she'll have to take. I cannot stand her in the first book but love her SO much in the sequels. Maas just does such an amazing job of writing complex characters with traumatic pasts who are completely broken, yet who still force themselves to keep going. Ughh so many feels. Dorian seriously is the most underrated character in this series. Someone give the guy a hug and a friend asap :( AND CAN WE TALK ABOUT CHAOL FOR A MINTUE?! He is so wonderful in this book and I love him so much. But I think fans can acknowledge that this series is about Celaena's journey. It's not about her love interest. But let me just go on a tangent about Chaol so I never have to talk about this stuff again: (view spoiler) [I wouldn't go for a love triangle or changing love interest that didn't feel 100% authentic... but this is so incredibly well done. The characters are all complex, flawed, multi-dimensional, and don't stay static. They change with life's events, which is probably going to mean that sometimes old relationships are no longer the best situation for them... it happens. If you read it again after knowing who Aelin is, their relationship is still beyond adorable but has some serious long-term obstacles. Chaol loved the very narrow image of Celaena that he wanted to see. Even while he loved her, he still worried about what she would do and was never completely comfortable with the other sides of her. THIS IS NOT A BAD THING, nor does it make him a bad person. Like you do not need to demonize Chaol in order to support Rowan or whatever. Chaol was perfect for Celaena at this point in her life. It's impossible for them to go back to how they were before, but that doesn't mean what they had was bad (so stop trying to turn Chaol into a Tamlin). I think both of their reactions are completely believable, it's all handled perfectly, and it adds so much to both characters and the story. Aaaaand guess what... it's fictional. So I completely disagree with any hate that Chaol or Celaena or Maas get after this book. That might be an unpopular opinion, but I get to type whatever I want here . AND I LOVE IT ALL.

IT WAS FANTASTIC! here's my full review/discusison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWuGx... I'll finish you one day, Crown of Midnight. But today is not that day! '\"Is it done?\" Celaena reached a gloved hand into the sack and tossed the severed head toward him. No one spoke as it bounced, a vulgar thudding of stiff and rotting flesh on marble. It rolled to a stop at the foot of the dais, milky eyes turned towards the ornate glass chandelier overhead. Dorian straightened, glancing away from the head. Chaol just stared at her. \"He put up a fight,\" Celaena said.' 'She was a beautiful wraith - and when she looked at him, it was like she didn't even know who he wa '\"Is it done?\" Celaena reached a gloved hand into the sack and tossed the severed head toward him. No one spoke as it bounced, a vulgar thudding of stiff and rotting flesh on marble. It rolled to a stop at the foot of the dais, milky eyes turned towards the ornate glass chandelier overhead. Dorian straightened, glancing away from the head. Chaol just stared at her. \"He put up a fight,\" Celaena said.' 'She was a beautiful wraith - and when she looked at him, it was like she didn't even know who he was.' As the Crown Prince, the son of the King of Adarlan, Dorian has grown up in the cold shadow of his father. He's seen cruel things, watched silently as death was handed out swiftly - and horribly - to those who dared to oppose his father. But watching Celaena become the King's Champion is a whole new experience. Gone is the girl with the teasing grin and the fancy for trinkets and pretty gowns. Gone is the soft-eyed pianist with gentle waves of golden hair falling around her face. In her place stands a woman, made up of edges sharp enough to cut, clothed from head to foot in black. The King's Champion...the King's Hand of Death. And Dorian can't help but wonder if she really has transformed...or whether Celaena is simply showing her true colours. The colours of an assassin. The colours of a cold-blooded, cold-hearted killer. 'Of course Chaol would notice the difference - he noticed everything. She couldn't tell if it pleased her or not.' Celaena's duties are smothering her, choking her like an iron collar around her neck. Killing off the king's enemies one by one is a gruesome and difficult task. Especially when her trips are not at all what they seem. Though from the outside, it may look like Celaena's nothing more than the king's pet assassin, her iron will is far from broken. But she cannot afford for her loyalty to the crown to be in doubt...so her plans, hopes and efforts remain a secret, locked up away inside of her, behind her cold and hard facade. Keeping up the charade may not be the death of her. But it could be the death of everyone she loves. 'He's got little to lose and a lot to gain. That makes people dangerous. Ruthless.' Secrets are not the only things hidden within the castle walls. Enemies hide behind saccharine-sweet smiles. Ancient powers rise to the surface. And above it all, the chess master scanning the board, sits the King of Adarlan - whose every move is deliberate, malicious. All aimed towards one end. The securing of power. Supreme rulership. Not only must Celaena deal with physical threats to her safety and that of those who she cares for, but she must face a horrible truth - a supernatural force that threatens to unravel the framework of the kingdom and plunge it into chaos. Fate calls. And Celaena isn't convinced that she should answer its summons - the stakes are too high. The price too heavy to pay. 'Do not let the light go out.' Choices. Loyalties. Sacrifices. Love. Celaena is at the forefront of an epic battle that has the power to change the kingdom forever - for better or for worse. But she must remember who she is. What she is fighting for. Or lose herself to the madness and to the darkness that lurks within her, in the depths of her eyes of brightest blue, ringed with gold. The making of a literary legend, Sarah J Maas' Crown of Midnight is a thrilling sequel which will have you sitting on daggers, awaiting her storytelling magic and more of Celaena's passionate spirit! A big thank you to Sarah J Maas, Netgalley and Bloomsbury USA Children's Publishing for the chance to read and review an ARC copy of the book :) Find this review and more on my blog: http://21stcenturyonceuponatime.blogs... _______________________________ Pre-reading review: So far away...SO FAR AWAY!! ...more Like the first book, 'Crown of Midnight' proves to be an action-packed, addicting, thrill ride.
