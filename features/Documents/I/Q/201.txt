And then you came\u2026 and I was awakened.\u201d Beautiful. Don't know what more to say about this book. Amazing and beautiful and those 5 stars don't do it justice. Z is definitely my favorite BDB Brother <3 \"He couldn\u2019t stand to have anyone put their hands to him\u2026though he wished he\u2019d let Bella find a piece of his flesh just once. With her, he might have been able to handle it.\" The story **this will be spoilerish to everyone who hasn't read the first two books** Six weeks has passed since Bella's kidnapping, and Zsadist has become more and more violent. He has only one goal: kill as many lessers as he can, and find out what happened to Bella. The Brotherhood is worried about him, and they have no clue why he's taken a personal interest to Bella,<---M> but then</---M>, it's not like anyone understands him at all. When a call comes with information that Bella is still alive, Z almost goes crazy because he has to wait for nightfall to go to her. The rescue... Won't talk about that, you have to experience it by yourself :( The real story begins there, Z wants Bella badly, but he knows she shouldn't be with him, even though she refuses to leave his side. Will he be able to set himself free of his past, with Bella's help? Read and see <3 \"He was terrifying, a horror of her species. Ruined, not broken, in the words of his twin. But that was what would have made him such a good savior. He alone was a match for the lesser who\u2019d taken her. Zsadist\u2019s kind of brutality was probably the only thing that could have gotten her out, though she knew better than to think that he\u2019d ever try to find her.\" The story - Heartbreaking. Just totally is. Even though we see the HEA, Z's past and all he went through... :((( But it was so wonderful to watch him heal, get past it, all with Bella's help... Amazing <3 The rescue scene was one of the most emotional ones for me, and my favorites were when Z was taking care of her <3 (view spoiler) [When his eyes changed! One of the best scenes ever <3 (hide spoiler) ] And then the mirror scene with the brothers! Loved it so much! Well damn, I pretty much loved the whole book, except the lesser parts! The flashbacks - There are flashbacks to Zsadist's and Phury's history in this book, and those scenes are tough and disturbing, when he was a blood/sex slave and when Phury rescued him. Not easy to read, but we learn so much about both of them, and why they're the way they are. The characters - There is a lot of John Matthew in this book, we see him adapting to his new life, and living with Tohr and Wellsie :) Butch and Marissa are going in circles, but nothing really happening between them. We meet Rehvenge, Bella's brother, who will have his own book later :) Phury has a very big role here, he's in love with Bella too, so we get to see his jealous and self-sacrificing side. Tohrment... My heart goes out to him. The sex - Well, you have to know that Z has a lot of baggage, being a sex slave for decades, and it isn't easy seeing him opening up to Bella, trying stuff, and ultimately having sex with her. Not the usual \"OMG this is so hot I'm going to combust\" type of scenes, just to warn you. But they are amazing, and very emotional! Just seeing him letting go of his fear... Yep, definitely worth it <3 But yeah there'll be the combustible scenes later on ahahah :DDD Oh\u2026 God. What was a male supposed to do in this situation? \"I'm sorry,\" he muttered. \"If I\u2026 uh, hurt your feelings or something.\" She glared at him. \"I'm not hurt. I'm pissed off and sexually frustrated.\" Bella has been held for six weeks by a deranged lesser maniac person, endured lots of horrible stuff, and thought she would die there without anyone knowing what happened to her. After she is rescued, she clings to Z and doesn't want to leave him. It takes her some time to realise what happened to Z when he was a slave, and she wants to help him get over it. As the book goes on, Bella falls in love with Zsadist (of course), and she happens to find herself in a terrible situation where she needs his help badly... \u201cWhen I said I won\u2019t apologize for it, I meant I never regret killing those bastards. But I didn\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t like you having those images in your head. I\u2019d take them from you if I could. I\u2019d take all of this from you\u2026bear it all for you. I\u2019m so\u2026fucking sorry this happened to you, Bella. Yeah, I\u2019m just sorry about the whole thing, including\u2026me.\u201d Bella comes with baggage herself, although, not as serious as Z, but it's still there. The torture and everything she endured while in captivity is something she can't forget, and Z is the only person she trusts enough to be around. She is very insecure in herself, after Z constantly pushes her away, thinking there's a problem with her, that he is repulsed by her now. It was very hard to read, I really felt sorry for her :( But just love the scene when she (view spoiler) [came to the floor to sleep beside him <3 (hide spoiler) ] It was just so sweet because of what Z did <3 Anyway, she doesn't know exactly what happened with Z, and he doesn't want to tell her, so that leads to a lot of difficult situations when she pushes him too far out of his comfort zone :((( But still, it's all worth it when we see the (view spoiler) [bonding and when he finally realises he loves her <3 (hide spoiler) ] Beautiful scenes! \"He was the cold that made her condense into herself again. And the heat that stopped her from shivering. He was the killer who made her safe.\" \"He thought about all the holes in him, the blank places, the voids where others felt things. When it came down to it, he was really just a screen, more empty than solid, his emotions blowing through him, only the anger catching and holding.\" Zsadist is a killer, emotionless and cold. He doesn't care about anything or anyone, even the Brotherhood doesn't trust him. He is scarred, inside and out. He wears piercings and has slave bands tattooed on his neck and arms. Not a fuzzy one, that Z. It all goes back to when he was being held as a blood slave, and was being sexually used as well. His mistress was a b*tch from hell, and with what he went through... No freaking wonder he turned out that way :( He hates sex and anything sexual because it reminds him of that woman, and he thinks himself unclean and unworthy of Bella, even though he is fiercely protective of her, and wants to have her for himself. He tries to push her toward Phury, even though it kills him, but he wants her with a male of worth, someone who he could've been. Still, we get to see him heal, all thanks to Bella, and the change in him is remarkable <3 \"He knew he was being overbearing as hell, but he couldn't help it. (view spoiler) [He was a bonded male. With his pregnant female. (hide spoiler) ] There were few things on the planet more aggressive or dangerous. And those bastards were called hurricanes and tornadoes.\" I can't say how much I love Z. He's definitely my favorite brother <3 He goes through a full transformation here, and it was just beautiful to see. First, when he was pining for Bella in her house. He wouldn't call it that way ahahha but it looked like it to me :) Poor guy, and then the rescue, even though she was the one who was wronged and endured terrible things, I still felt terrible for Z in that scene :( Later on, every protective thing he did concerning Bella had me swooning and sighing and wanting to cry and hug him like crazy <3 He fought it all the way, pushed Bella away from him almost all the time, even though he terribly wanted to be with her :( Like I said before, his biggest problem was him feeling unworthy of Bella, and everything he did was because of it. So, so sad :((( But this book really was all about him, how he changed completely, by overcoming his fears and insecurities, and becoming the person who he was supposed to be. The ending, with the paper <3 End the epilogue!!! Best! Ever <3 \"Phury... what happened to me?\" As the male came up behind him, his brother's face appeared right beside Z's. And then Wrath's dark reflection showed up in the mirror, all long hair and sunglasses. Then <---C>Rhage</---C>'s star-fallen beauty. And Vishous's Sox cap. And Tohrment's brush cut. And Butch's busted nose. One by one they reached out and touched him, their big hands gently on his shoulders. \"Welcome back, my brother,\" Phury whispered. Zsadist stared at the males who were behind him. And the oddest thought that if he were to let himself go limp and fall backward... they would catch him. My favorite quotes from other characters: \"That female who\u2019d walked in on him and the Reverend clearly had a big mouth and\u2026Christ. Butch must have already told Vishous. The two were like an old mated couple, no secrets between them. And V would squeal to Rhage. And once Rhage knew, you might as well have popped the news flash on the Reuters wire.\" \u201cThe snow falls slowly tonight,\u201d V said, rubbing his thumb back and forth over a thick jugular vein. Phury blinked as an odd calm came over him, his heart slowing to the rhythm of his brother\u2019s thumb. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cThe snow\u2026it falls so slowly.\u201d \u201cYes\u2026yes, it does.\u201d \u201cAnd we\u2019ve had a lot of snow this year, haven\u2019t we?\u201d \u201cUh\u2026yes.\u201d \u201cYeah\u2026lot of snow, and there\u2019s going to be more. Tonight. Tomorrow. Next month. Next year. The stuff comes when it comes and falls where it will.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Phury said softly. \u201cThere\u2019s no stopping it.\u201d \u201cNot unless you\u2019re the ground.\u201d The thumb stopped. \u201cMy brother, you don\u2019t look like the earth to me. You\u2019re not stopping him. Ever.\u201d \u201cOh, man,\u201d he said with more gravel than voice. Then he glanced at Vishous, who was passed out next to him. \u201cOh\u2026man, this is too weird.\u201d \u201cGet over yourself, cop. You\u2019re not that attractive.\u201d \u201cButch? Maybe you could\u2026call on me.\u201d \u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d She flushed and seemed to wilt. \u201cI had hoped\u2026\u201d \u201cHoped what?\u201d \u201cThat perhaps\u2026\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cYou might call on me. If you had some time. Perhaps you could come\u2026calling.\u201d (view spoiler) [ \"Outside of the office, Phury put John down and held him in place. There was a moment or two of silence\u2026and then a raw scream shattered the air as sure as if the oxygen were a solid. The burst of energy that followed was so strong it shattered the glass door. Shards splintered and sprayed out while Phury sheltered John from the shrapnel. One by one down both lengths of the hall, the fluorescent ceiling lights exploded, flashing bright and leaving streamers of sparks to bleed down from the fixtures. Energy vibrated up through the concrete floor, leaving cracks that ran into the cinder-block walls. Through the busted door John saw a whirlwind in the office, and the Brothers were backing away from it, arms in front of their faces. Pieces of furniture whipped around a black hole in the center of the room, one that was vaguely shaped like Tohr\u2019s head and body.\" (hide spoiler) ] \u201cI\u2019ve only ever had you to live for. If you die I have nothing. I\u2019m utterly lost. And you are needed here.\u201d Zsadist tried to reach out, but couldn\u2019t lift his arms as Phury stood up. \u201cGod, Z, I keep thinking this tragedy of ours is going to be over. But it just keeps going, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Verily, the most beautiful book ever. <3 [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more My dear friend Karla and I went on this emotional roller coaster of a ride together.

It was so much fun and I enjoyed every minute! Her unique way with words and her humor kept me in stitches. Thank you sweet Karla for reading this with me and to all our friends for their encouragement along the way! Whew...What a story! There is no way I can do a review and do justice to this book. Zsadist's story was everything and more that I was told. I have fallen hard for another one of JRW's brothers! Below are just a few of my thoughts/feelings. Zsadist is without a doubt one of the most tortured heroes I\u2019ve read. He broke me. My heart shattered. His deep feelings of unworth tore me to shreds! His self loathing is palpable and the intense anguish he endures each day left me in pain. His intense self hatred at times was difficult to read. As the author reveals his past in small portions, my heart ached more. And when all was told, a nursery rhyme came to mind, Humpty Dumpty...all shattered to pieces never to be put together again. No, I promise I didn't relate this warrior with the fat egg, only the results of their fall. I soon learned the horrifying scar he wears on his face is nothing compared to his inner anguish. \u201cRuined, not broken\u201d ----Heartbreaking words issued as a warning to the heroine, Bella, to stay clear of this brother! And what a heroine! Bella is so easy to love and I admired her inner strength and her determination. Portions of their story are absolutely sizzling hot and heart wrenching! It had me crying, laughing, cursing, holding my breath in fear, gasping in awe, and at times, fighting mad! But Oh my, what a love story! Intense, hot, emotional, tender; unfortunately, their love is fraught by Z's demons! In addition to Zsadist and Bella\u2019s story, this book is slam full to the brim! There is a heart breaking scene that had me in tears, and I mean crying heartbroken tears! I was even mad at the author! I also learned how much one can hate a lesser! I wanted to pouf him out of their world myself!! And OMGosh, the love I have for Phury, who is Zsadist\u2019s twin brother! The sacrifices he made is a beautiful thing and there is one particular scene that I nearly cried buckets! And what\u2019s up with V and Butch and (view spoiler) [ that drink? (hide spoiler) ] I must read Butch\u2019s story next! And last but in no way least, there is a scene that had me gulping in total, shocked, didn\u2019t see that coming surprise! While this was an amazing, intense and emotional read, and one that I loved, I needed more Zsadist and Bella alone time. I felt there just wasn't enough intimacy given to this couple, especially toward the end. Also, while I loved the epilogue, I wished for more. Thanks again sweet Karla! It was so much fun sharing our thoughts and feelings along the way:) *Hugs* \u2665 A great big thank you to my dear friends Dhes, Dorsey, Jaynie and Dee who encouraged me to start this series!

Sooooo . This was ridiculous, stupid and boring . Wait, I think I'm forgetting something here. Oh yeah, it was pretty lame , too. I think it's high time to get my favourite antediluvian beast out of extinction: Good doggy . Believe it or not , the main problem with this thing book is NOT that it is PNR. Well, as 99.99% of PNR novels, it is indeed silly and OTT and slightly ridiculous . But that's to be expected in this silly and OTT and slightly ridiculous genre. A note to all you adorable PNR trolls out there: this is not a bad thing in itself. Unlike this literary masterpiece here, some books can actually be silly, OTT, ridiculous and NOT STUPID. They can even be entertaining sometimes. I kid you not. So the answer to the question you didn't ask is: yes, I am aware that this thing book never pretended to be deep and complex and \u00e0 la quantum physics. Doesn't mean it had to be this crappy, though. Now, the main problem with this delightful story? Its Bogus Alpha Asshole MC (BAAM\u2122), aka Z. aka Zsadist (if, like me, you think his name is somewhat stupid and vaguely laughable, please feel free to eyeroll here). So the guy is supposed to be this super antisocial, twisted, sick bastard who rejoices in being a total prick 24/7 and supposedly loves nothing better than inflicting pain . <---A>J.R. Ward</---A>, you are so damn funny . Because Z the Counterfeit Sadist (ZtCS\u2122) is nothing but a big, pathetic, woe-is-me cry baby with the mushy heart of a 13 year old schoolgirl . I swear, the guy is an insult to all the Gloriously Fucked up, Slightly Unhinged, Mentally Unstable Jerks (GFUSUMUJ\u2122) currently living in peace and harmony in my High Security Harem. Shame on you for creating one of the most ridiculous characters in the history of ridiculous characters , J.R. Ward. Luckily enough for you, Fleet Admiral DaShrimp and the Murderous Crustacean Troops (MCT\u2122) are away on holiday at the moment (they are visiting their decapodic cousins in the South Seas), so I can't unleash them on you. BUT I do have a few fluffy bunnies mercenaries on my payroll. Not impressed, are you? Well don't let their disgusting cuteness kill you. These little guys are devious, ruthless fuckers fiends with deliciously homicidal tendencies . So if I were you I'd start running now. FAST. And that is all . Well, it's not really all, but I've wasted enough time with this thing as it is. Besides, the story is your basic, standard PNR crap , so there isn't much to say about it. Well I could tell you that it is silly and OTT and ridiculous and slightly stupid , but I think I might have already said that, so it's better if I don't repeat myself, right? Right . \u00bb And the moral of this Fantastically Fascinating Non-Review (FFNR\u2122) is: this is it. I've had it. I am done done done trying to commit PNR-induced suicide. Yes, that's right, the divorce is final and the masochist in me has finally decided to give up on this pathetic charming genre. Except if Ilona Andrews , Pippa DaCosta , Glen Cook or Craig Schaefer decide to tackle it, that is. Unfortunately, that seems a bit unlikely . But you never know, a crustacean can hope. Oh, and by the way, I reserve the right to read books by Veronica Del Rosa , too. Because the girl wouldn't know how to write harebrained PNR even if she tried. The end. You're welcome. And stuff . \u2709 To the three lovely ladies nutcases who collectively recommended I read this thing: it was nice knowing you. I'm sorry you have to die such a slow, horrible, painful death . ...more Oh. My. God. I'm not even sure I can convey the complete absurdity of this book.

Meanwhile, our heroine stands placidly by (of course), feels compelled to love him despite his faults (of course), and gradually tames the beast within-- after several rounds of rather rough sex (of course). We also get some lovely flashbacks to Zsadist being tortured and abused (of course). Seriously, this reads like the worst of fan fiction AUs brought together. The other male leads have names like \tVishous, Phury and Rhage and this is not supposed to be take as comedy and/or irony??? Also, the soliloquies where Zsadist is hating on his penis are pretty amazing. Also, the universe! ZOMG, it is so freaking complicated. Vampires! Vampire slayers! Vampire protectors! Vampire drug addicts! Seriously, there are guide books sold to help readers understand this universe! Clearly, this is the romance industry's version of Anne Rice and Laurel K. Hamilton.

My Zsadist: Zsadist is a tortured soul, the darkest of the Brothers, the meanest. After spending a hundred years as a blood and sex slave, he has nothing left to give anyone, and he can barely stay alive for himself. He has survived pain, mental anguish, cringing depths of humiliation and degradation, hopelessness, helplessness. Z is my favorite kind of man. He is scary shit, and I dig it. He is beyond saving, and he doesn\u2019t want to be saved. He is HILARIOUS!!! Humor is my #1 favorite attribute in any man, especially sarcastic humor. I laugh at (almost) everything Z says. The other stuff he says just shreds my heart. Z had no love to give anyone. But the hatred he had he would channel for Bella until the last breath left his lungs. Bella is a HERO ine!!!! She saves Zsadist from himself. She saves Zsadist from death. She is devoted to him whole-heartedly and fights through all of his darkness. She is his constant. My Bella: Bella is drawn to Z, and she decides that she wants him, and when Bella makes a decision, it\u2019s final!!! I love her devotion to Z!! She is so confident and has such courage that she is the perfect match for him. He was the killer who made her safe. Their love is...Gah!!! It\u2019s push and pull. There isn't another love like theirs. He pushes her away so many times, but he cannot resist her love because she gives so much of herself to him. \u201cI love you.\u201d Z squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cDon\u2019t be a tragedy, Bella.\u201d \u201dDon\u2019t make me go,\u201d she whispered. He was going to take her with all the strength he had, and she was going to be sore when he was through using her. Sore and utterly blissed out. She couldn\u2019t wait. I LOVE the ending to this book! It has me up on my feet pumping my fist in the air! I love Z to death, but Bella makes this book so much better, and she contributes her own badass-ness to this ending! In conclusion...I love Zsadist!!!! ...more Opening Line: \"Goddamn it, Zsadist!

LOVER AWAKENED tells the agonizingly painful story of Zsadist, a former blood slave and most feared member of the Blackdagger Brotherhood. After Zsadist rescues the beautiful, aristocrat Bella from the Lessoning Society's torture facility she refuses to leave his side (or bed.) Craving the strength and security she now finds only with him. And it's with her growing love and patience that this reluctant hero ultimately `awakens'. It's a bumpy ride for our pair and this relationship will leave you in tears, both of joy and sadness as we witness Z's transformation from the `cold one' into a male of worth. A multilayered novel L.A of course has several stories and POV's running simultaneously and the action never stops. Full of suspense, erotic and ultimately heartbreaking. Introduced briefly in the past two books, we now get to find out what made Zsadist the way he is. A confirmed sociopath who avoids all relationships, Z is scarred, pierced, tattooed, violent and illiterate. He's the most feared Brother and distrusted by all because of his intimidating and just downright mean nature. He enjoys pain yet can't bare any kind of physical contact due to the years of physical and sexual abuse he suffered during his time as a blood slave. Zsadist makes for an unlikely romantic hero but JR brilliantly gains your sympathy and you will grow to love this misunderstood and abused character. Phury as Zsadist's twin plays a major role here, and through a series of flashbacks we learn the details of Z's enslavement and Phury's daring rescue of him. It's a striking scene resulting in the loss of his leg and Z's brutal scarring. Phury has spent his life consumed with fixing his twin and is riddled with guilt, sacrificing time and again and it's starting to take a toll. Now exhausted, he's playing a deadly game with the `red smoke' and despite his vow of celibacy can't help being attracted to Bella. We also get to know Rehvenge the Sympath club owner of Zerosum and John Mathew's story starts to unfold as he begins his training and accepts the love of a family. Of course all the Brothers get some attention so we get shots of Wrath, Rhage, Vishous, Butch and their respective `Shellans.' Some of my favourite scenes involve the Brothers just going about their daily business, little interludes in the kitchen, or hanging out playing pool and teasing each other. Unfortunately the Lessers continue their torment making things personal now as their leader Mr. O attempts to reclaim Bella and a shocking loss occurs within the Brotherhood family that will be felt throughout the rest of this series. Z and Bella's love story takes center stage throughout though and is utterly fascinating. From the moment of rescue Zsadist won't let anyone else near Bella. And despite being frightened of him she wants him. To Bella he is perfect and she slowly begins to seduce him. Z is subsequently terrified, feeling dirty and hating his body's response to her. When the two finally kiss however...sigh. Ultimately Z's feelings of unworthiness force him to push her away. Into the arms of a male of worth, those of his twin brother. When Bella goes into her 'needing' though which twin will ease her suffering? The celibate one or the one who can't bear to be touched? The climax of this book is simply unput-downable. With a suicide mission forcing one twin to sacrifice everything for the life of the other and a HEA that brings tears to your eyes as we get a rare glimpse of the future. Each book in this series just gets better and better but JR has outdone herself here. I would give this more *s if I could and can't recommend it enough ...more Jesus, I hated Zsadist before this book. I thought of him as a ruthless killer, and he is. But there is another side of him that is revealed in this book. With Bella, Zsadist's tortured soul is exposed. You see a much darker side of him that is painful and I feel ashamed to say that I am captivated by him. Knowing him, that is the last thing he would want. Zsadist has no patience for those who show sympathy or pity him. And I respect him more for that. This is one of the more darker books of the Jesus, I hated Zsadist before this book.

It's content is brooding and involves a lot of self-loathing. A lot of Phury's story is told here as well. Damn, the thing he goes through for his brother... I can't even imagine his pain. Now I can see why in Lover Enshrined he is such a mess. But God bless him for his efforts. He is a good male. Both of them are. And Wellsie. Poor woman. The hurt that Tohr and John must feel... I still cannot believe it. Also, John seems to be growing up already in this book. In the last few pages I found myself saying, \"Good for him\" as he picked up those weapons and practiced with them. Ward does an amazing job fitting happiness and sorrow and pain all together to create a delicious mix that is consumed by all.

Z's mind was so twisted that, for a moment, I doubted the possibility of a believable HEA for him. I shouldn't have, though. Can I just say I loved the epilogue? :) Bella was everything Z needed. She had been attracted to him since they first met in Lover Eternal and, for reasons he couldn't understand, he also felt a strong connection to her. When presented with the chance to be with Z, Bella was honest and direct about it - and I congratulated her for it. But then, (view spoiler) [Z told her to go away in the end and, instead of fighting for them, she just complied!?! (hide spoiler) ] Not what I expected (view spoiler) [from a woman/vampire who had just killed her kidnapper, (hide spoiler) ] but that gave room for the wonderful scene with Z writing her that sigh-worthy note, so I guess I can excuse that. Now, Phury... Call me insensitive but, at this point, I almost despise him. I was probably supposed to embrace him as a larger-than-life, altruistic man/vampire, but he just came across as a pathetic loser - not to mention, drug addict - to me. Get a life, my brother! And Tohr... Why, oh why did Ms. Ward feel the need to do that to him? Didn't we have enough wild and wrecked Brothers? Couldn't we have at least one \"normal\" guy among them? Based on some comments I'd heard before reading this book, I knew (view spoiler) [Wellsie was going to die, (hide spoiler) ] but that didn't make me less unhappy when the time came. As it happened in the previous book, Lover Eternal , I didn't care for the scenes with the lessers in this book either and I wish Ms. Ward stopped giving them so much \"screen time\". I know I don't stand a chance of seeing this happening, so I guess this series will never get a 5-star rating for me. Oh well, it isn't like that would make any difference, because these books have already a gazillion rabid fans and I won't be missed, LOL.

Lover Awakened is an amazing tale and is now one of my favourite books that I have read.... EVER ! In this installment to the series, J. R. Ward tells the agonizingly painful story of Zsadist, a former blood (and sex) slave and likely the most feared member of the Brotherhood. We were introduced to Bella, our heroine, in book 2 of the series. Bella has been kidnapped by the Lessers and Z eventually finds her and rescues her from the torture facility. Once rescued, Bella refuses to leave Z\u2019s side and as she relies on his strength and the security she now finds with him despite who he is and how daunting he comes across. It is with Bella\u2019s love and fortitude that this reluctant hero ultimately \u201cawakens\u201d. I will readily admit that their journey to a HEA is a bumpy ride \u2013 one that left me in tears, both of joy and sadness as we witness Z's transformation from an emotional ghost into a male who can finally find love and happiness. \u201cRuined, not broken.....\u201d Zsadist is without a doubt one of the most tortured heroes I\u2019ve ever read about and I will forever compare him to future tortured heroes I read about. He simply broke me and my heart shattered continuously while reading his story. His deep feelings of un-worth and self-hatred tore me to shreds! Despite his hardness and complete lack of regard for those around him (including Bella at times), I could not help but fall for him and when his vulnerability came through his rough demeanor I was even more of a goner. I found the moments where Z let himself be vulnerable the most heartbreaking to read about. Even writing this review, my heart still aches for him! That is simply great writing on Ward\u2019s part! As she carefully dried off his ragged flesh, she said, \"You are clean.\" \"Oh, no, I'm not. I'm really not.\" His voice started to rise, a terrible momentum growing \"I'm filthy. I am so very dirty. I am dirty, dirty...\" Now he babbled, the words running together, the volume lifting until hysteria pinged off the tiles and filled the bathroom. \"Can you see the dirt? I see it everywhere. It coats me. It seals me in...\" Scenes like this literally wrecked me! Phury..... Another aspect that I loved about this book is that there was so much more than Z\u2019s and Bella\u2019s story that touched me and made me feel. Phury was a big part of why I will forever love Lover Awakened . We get more of his back story with Z and there is so much more to him than we can possibly imagine. I loved the healing that took place between Z and Phury at the end. Gah.....can my heart break anymore....yes, it did! Every day Phury slept alone, if he slept at all. Food gave him little pleasure. Females were out because of his celibacy. And every second he was worried about what Zsadist would pull next and who would get hurt in the process. He felt like he was dying from a thousand cuts, slowly bleeding out. A target by proxy for all his twin's murderous intent. ********* Phury knelt beside him and stroked his face. \"I've only ever had you to live for. If you die I have nothing I'm utterly lost. And you are needed here.\" Zsadist tried to reach out, but couldn't lift her arms are Phury stood up. \"God Z, I keep thinking this tragedy of ours is going to be over. But it just keeps going doesn't it?\" The Brotherhood..... I loved reading more about the connection between the Brothers. It is real, intense and they truly are a deep rooted family. Even though I am sure the Brothers have a hard time with Z, they are there for him and fight with him (and for him). Zsadist stared at the males who were behind him. And he the oddest thought that if he were to let himself go limp and fall backward...they would catch him. I simply can not emphasize enough how much I truly LOVED this book. I am unable to give Lover Awakened enough accolades. If you have not read this series.... DO IT! Enough said! I have to end with my favourite scene in Lover Awakened . I will go as far as saying this is one of the best scenes ever. He glanced back down at the pencil in his hand and then turned to the table. Flipping the spiral notebook to a new page, he bent way over and labored on top of the paper for quite a while. Then he ripped the sheet free. His hand was shaking as he held it out. \"It's messy.\" Bella took the paper. In a child's uneven block letters there were three words: I LOVE YOU Her lips flattened tight as her eyes stung. The handwriting got wavy and then disappeared. \"Maybe you can't read it,\" he said in a small voice. \"I can do it over.\" She shook her head. \"I can read it just fine. It's\u2026 beautiful.\" \"I don't expect anything back. I mean\u2026 I know that you don't\u2026 feel that for me anymore. But I wanted you to know. It's important that you knew. And if there's any chance we could be together\u2026 I can't stop my job with the Brotherhood. But I can promise that I'll be so much more careful with myself\u2014\" He frowned and stopped talking. \"Shit. What am I saying? I promised myself I wouldn't put you in this position\u2014\" She crushed the paper to her heart, then launched herself at him, hitting his chest so hard he stumbled back. As his arms came around her with hesitation, as if he didn't have any idea what she was doing or why, she wept openly. In all her preparations for this meeting, the one thing she had never considered was that the two of them might have some sort of future. When he tilted up her chin and looked down at her she tried to smile, but the crazy hope she felt was too heavy and joyous a burden. \"I didn't mean to make you cry\u2014\" \"Oh, God\u2026 Zsadist, I love you.\" His eyes flared so wide, his brows nearly hit his hairline. \"What\u2026 ?\" \"I love you.\" \"Say that again.\" \"I love you.\" \"Again\u2026 please,\" he whispered. \"I need to hear it\u2026 again.\" \"I love you\u2026\" His response was to start praying to the Scribe Virgin in the Old Language. Holding Bella tight, burying his face in her hair, he gave thanks with such eloquence she started to weep all over again. When the last laudation had been murmured he switched back into English. \"I was dead until you found me, though I breathed. I was sightless, though I could see. And then you came\u2026 and I was awakened.\" SIDE NOTE: This has to be the first book where I wished I was a vampire. After Ward's description of the \"needing\", who wouldn't want to be a vampire.

Oh yes, this book was dee-licious ! I got married in July 2008 and brought the first two books in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series to keep myself amused on the honeymoon flight. They were cracktastic and addictive and fun and I eagerly added the next title to my queue on booksfree.com (the site I\u2019ve been relying on ever since I put myself on an economical and restrictive book diet that prohibits the purchase of books I won\u2019t reread). Fast forward to October 2008 and I\u2019m still waiting for Lover Awakened, the third book in the BDB series. The availability of this book has never been on track for the rate that I have returned books and others were repeatedly bumped to the top and sent out instead. Things were getting serious and I was going into some major BDB withdrawal but I lucked out recently when a friend graciously offered to lend me not only this book, but also the fourth, fifth and sixth in the series (thanks Jen!) And now that I\u2019ve finally had a chance to read this installment, it comes as no surprise that the waiting list is so long. This book is beyond hot! Zsadist is one twisted mofo and I\u2019ve been extremely curious as to how Ward was going to portray him in a way that would make me sympathize with his unusual tastes. Personally, I think it was a success. Zsadist was a perfect blend of anger, dementia, anger , anger, terror, anger, confusion\u2026and\u2026and\u2026timid tenderness? Which, wow, totally floored me. ***spoilers past this point*** The second book in this series, Lover Eternal, had bothered me for several reasons, one being that the author spent waaaay too much time building up for number three and left a cliffhanger completely neglected at the very end of number two. To me, a cliffhanger means ending the book with an unsatisfying shocker that leaves your reader nearly in pain but eager for the next installment (ie Karen Marie Moning\u2019s Fever series which I\u2019m still twitching in anticipation for!) But in Lover Eternal, the fact that Bella had been kidnapped by a bad guy and had not yet been recovered is not even mentioned at the very end. Instead, Rhage and Mary go on to have their own piss-poor happily ever after and to be quite frank, the fact that they never even mentioned Bella\u2019s kidnapping or even expressed some concern over their friend\u2019s predicament cheapened both of them as individuals in my eyes. Fortunately this one was totally different. Bella was rescued. Bella was messed up. Bella had a freaky new tattoo. Bella decided Zsadist\u2019s room was the only place she\u2019d feel safe (hmm). Zsadist tweaked out. Zsadist had complete meltdowns on numerous occasions and when Bella finally leaned in and kissed him for the very first time, I almost fell off the couch. It was that good. Also of noteworthy mention is that the number of times the word \u201cshitkickers\u201d appeared in this novel\u2019s pages was significantly down (thank god). The number of times one Brother said to another Brother, \u201cbla bla bla bla bla bla, true?\u201d was down (what a relief). And references to rap artists I don\u2019t listen to was also down (yesssss!) Overall, I think this book was a complete success and I need to own a copy I can love and cherish forever.

I love The Black Dagger Brotherhood series (even though I don\u2019t normally read the genre), but I delayed continuing the series for a long time due to the book length. Now I\u2019m regretting doing that because I could have progressed in the series a lot more than I currently am. Even though the books are long, they certainly worth every words. \"I am sick. I am disgusting. I can't be trusted.\" When Z was first introduced in the series, I found him repulsive. But very quickly I was intrigued by his nature and I wanted to know more about him. This book certainly brought justice to this misunderstood character. He was surprisingly endearing, and paired with his past, I just can\u2019t help but falling in love with him. I admired Bella\u2019s strength and determination. Outwardly, they were like day and night. But inside they were more similar than anyone would guess. \"So you've got to understand why I die for you every day. Your pain is mine.\" My heart hurt so much for his twin Phury. Their bond, conflicts and sacrifices was heartbreaking, yet heartwarming. \"The two of you are spending way too much time together, you feel me?\" I\u2019ve always loved Butch and V\u2019s bromance. And this book, they took it to the next level. I also love John Matthew. His story was a prominent secondary story chronicling his growing pains. Lover Awakened unsheathed a different side of Zsadist while actively including several secondary stories making it an exciting and engaging story. I can\u2019t wait to see how things are going to evolve from here. Books in the series: For more reviews/reveals/giveaways visit: ...more And finally, 04/11/2012, my re-read over.

Bella still love you. Its you who fulfill her special needs And you are father of her child, Nalla. You have a book and story with so many heartbreaking moment... I'm still crying when know about your horrible past with Mistress... I'm still crying when reading about Tohr and Wellsie.. I know how devastated John Matthew after that... I know how Phury's feeling to you. Why he must love woman who his twin's mate, while he doesn't want to hurt you because you are his one and only family? You seems can't be redeemable... Your last action at the club make Bella angry. And yeah, me too... But, your effort to make it up, learn reading and writing, it really make me cry (again). You have Bella's heart at that moment you write \" I love You\" to her (and my heart too) And you have the best BDB quote ever : I was dead until you found me, though I breathed. I was sightless, though I could see. And then you came...and I was awakened.\" And the epilogue of your book? One of the best epilogue I've read ! Dear Zsadist, You will always be my favorite Brothers (beside Vishous, of course). I'm glad you find your own happiness, to have family at your own. Well, not always happily ever after, but life is good,right? I might be crazy to love you so bad. But really, you are one of heroes that always be in my heart... forever. From your #1 Fans Ren Note : And thanks to J.R.Ward to write the best book of BDB series. I think I will always miss her early writing at the first 3 books. Not that I don't like BDB anymore, I'm sure I can love this series again like before. And thanks, God! Indonesian Publisher learn from their fault and well, this is the Indonesian cover of Lover Awakened Never know why they used man titty abs, but ehm, that's not bad. And I'm not complaining, tho.

I almost fainted of excitement because as most of you know Zsadist is my favorite brother in the BDB. Did his book reach my expectations? Meet then my Zsadist and Bella... Zsadist. He is the most terrifying and scarred member of the black dagger brotherhood. Zsadist has a lot of demons from his past that just won't let go of him no matter what. Renowned for his unquenchable fury and sinister deeds, he is a savage feared by humans and vampires alike. Anger is his only companion, and terror is his only passion. Until he meets Bella. Bella. She is a beautiful and lost vampire, and is instantly entranced by the seething power Zsadist possesses. Bella knows there is much more to him than ugly scars and violence he is so well known for. But can she make him see that? Can they find a future together before Zsadist's thirst for vengeance ruins it all? (LOL. Sorry, saw it and couldn't help myself). What i thought of Zsadist and Bella?: I LOVED them both with all my heart! They were very realistic and unique characters to read about. Bella didn't annoy me and i understood Zsadist perfectly. I had a connection with them. There were a few complications to their relationship - like Zsadist pushing Bella away. And even though he changed, i though he could do it without her if someone would show him a bit of love and support. My heart was clenching in pain everytime i read about how mean, and unfair everyone was to Zsadist. I wanted to lock them in a disgusting hole and let them rot there. They were blaming him for all the bad stuff without getting all the facts and evidence. They just automatically thought it was him. The ending was the reason this book didn't go to my 'favorites' shelf ( i was very tempted to do so at the start, but then i was like no way). It felt too rushed and cheesy to be realistic and satisfactionary enough, but i still found it a sweet HEA. Overall... Lover Awakened was full of action , heartbreak , suspense , angst and hot scenes . It was a book about moving on , love , forgiveness and trusting again . The writing style and characters were as usual FANTASTIC . Great plo t too, really enjoyable. I would recommend this to all BDB fans who haven't read this yet, and for those who have to re-read it. And for those who haven't read this series at all i would recommend you pick it up immediately , especially if you're a fan of Larrisa Ione and her Demonica series! ...more Plot: 5 stars Characters: 5 stars Writing: 5 stars Sexiness: 4 stars Ending: 5 stars Overall: 4.8 stars I've fallen in love with Zsadist :) Sorry for the late review :/ I was too overwhelmed with happiness when I finished XD SPOILERS EVERYWHERE!

Utterly. Speechless. Well, in a good way of course. \"And diamond were eternal, weren't they? They lasted forever. Just like his memories of her.\" Okay, let me talk about the ending first, since that is what I remember most XD I really found it romantic when Zsadist was trying to learn to read and write. That just completely warmed my heart up and melted it. Literally. I felt as though I was suffocating and couldn't breathe after this particular scene. And the fact that he addressed Mary to teach him was super sweet of him. Beth and Mary are truly amazing women but Bella is awesome-er, if that is even a word...??? \"'I got you Bella,' Zsadist's voice. Low. Full of strength. 'You're safe. You're out of here. And you're never going back.'\" Next, Bella carrying Zsadist's young. Now this, was just complete shock! A good shock of course! Remember when Zsadist trying to learn to read and write melted my heart, well this completely burned my heart. I have literally nothing left in my chest. Nothing. I think I cried. Yep. That's right. I shed some tears. Please don't make fun of me. This was very overwhelming and made the story so good. Really, this is the BEST book so far! \"As she shuffled back, he glanced down at the tent between his legs. Christ, that goddamn thing in there was huge; he looked like he had another arm in his pants.\" Now, let's talk about Phurry. Let me get this out there, I was fucking stupid. That one scene when he shaved his hair off and cut his face, I honestly thought that he was trying to be Zsadist to get Bella for himself. I. Am. So. Fucking. Stupid. And then, like the idiot I was, it took me a while to realize that Phurry is sacrificing himself so Zsadist doesn't die. I don't know why I didn't get that before. Something is wrong with my BRAIN But that's beside the fact. What I'm trying to say is that Phurry is the best brother or twin someone could ever ask for. Zsadist is really really lucky to have a brother like Phurry. He's the type of person whom you could trust with your whole and I mean whole life. I'm not talking shit right now. I'm serious. Dead serious. Phurry doesn't seem like the kind of guy who would break promises or isn't capable to putting someone down just because they harmed someone he loves. \"I'm filthy. I am so very dirty. I am dirty, dirty...\" Zsadist: When Zsadist was first introduced in Dark Lover , I fell in a hole. A deep hole. The deeper the hole, the deeper I adore Z. At first, it was pretty deep, in Lover Eternal , it went a little deeper, and now, in Lover Awakened , I'm telling you, it can fucking reach Hell. I don't know why, but from the moment when I first read about him, he just was like a magnet that attracted to me. I wish I were Bella instead of me, but we all know that ain't even gonna happen. Anyways, even though he was very quiet at first and wasn't really open, he can surprise you and be the complete opposite. In this book, he talks a lot and showcases a lot of his emotions, which I really loved, so thank you very much, J.R. Ward . You. Are. Amazing. Really, I could go on and on and on and on and on, etc., about how Zsadist is such a great and sexy-ass character, but I'll stop there :) \"For her, he was... the one.\" Bella: I feel the same exact way for Bella. Even though she was introduced in Lover Eternal and was a minor character, I felt as though I really connected with her, as I did with Zsadist. Again, I could write a 10 paragraph essay on how good Zsadist and Bella are but eh. 10 paragraphs seems too long for me to write at the moment. \"Dear Virgin in the Fade, no wonder males killed to protect their mates.\" Oh, and I forgot to mention, I sobbed. I literally burst into tears. Why? Wellsie... Sarelle... (not really sure how to spell her name) So everything in this book was utter perfection except for this one part. J.R. Ward just had to come out of no-fucking-where and throw this bombshell at us! What. The. Fuck? And David. Or should I say, \"Mr. O/O.\" Ok. I don't like to have too much cuss words in one review because I don't want to come out as someone who needs to cuss to live. I really don't. But just this once, I'm going to say it: O is a fucking piece of fucking shit. He is a fucking asshole. Ok. There. I said it. Like Bella and Zsadist, I could give you a whole essay on how much I hate O but I ain't gonna bother because pieces of shit like him deserve fucking nothing. Nothing. I feel really bad for Thorment and John Matthew.... I'm wearing black tomorrow to mourn for Wellsie. No fucking joke. I will. But hey? It's not like someone is gonna come up to me in the middle of the street and ask me why I'm wearing black. Only you and I will know *evil laughter* It may seem as though I'm taking this a little to far, but I mean it. I was HEARTBROKEN when O, like the motherf**ker he is killed them both. And to think that Sarelle and John could've been a thing :/ I HATE LESSERS AND THEY SHOULD ALL DIE AND GO TO HELL! Oh, and Rhevenge, Bella's older brother being the Reverend that owns ZeroSum: this rendered me speechless. I honestly didn't see that coming. Really, when I was reading this, I was so stupid. I was too caught up in how sexy Zsadist was XD All in all, this book was FUCKING amazing! Can't wait to get started on Butch and Marissa's story, Lover Revealed . \"Man, he was going to need a neck brace after this conversation.\" \"'I could tongue you forever.'\" \"Bella took the paper. In a child's uneven block letters there were three words: I LOVE YOU.\" \"'I carry your young. \"'If you think I'm taking even the slightest chance with you and my young, you are out of your mind.'\" ...more This is my second time reading this book. Although there was way too many side-plots and other POVs, I'm still going to keep my original rating. I loved Z's back story, even though it was sad and horrible.

More Butch. Phury is getting set up for his book. There's lots of small scenes with the Lessers, which is nothing new. Rhevenge even has his first POV. I never like the \"sidebar\" scenes - I just want the MEAT of the story. And Z and Bella's story is still great.

All you can do is wait to bury me.\u201d (Just add the scar and this is my PERFECT Z) Zsadist is the broken warrior of the BDB. He had a different upbringing than the rest of the brotherhood. As an infant, he was taken from his family. When he was a child, he became a blood slave. He was abused in more than one way, and he never really got over it. The only person who can usually get to him is his brother Phury. Z is the way he is for a reason. He doesn\u2019t feel good enough. He seems like a cold blooded scary killer, but underneath his hard exterior, there is so much more. He is sad, scared, tortured, and self loathing. Then there is Bella... Bella comes from an aristocratic vampire family. She is a woman of worth. She had a connection with Z in the last book, and he felt it too. But he felt unworthy of her, so he pushed her away. Now she has been missing for months. Z makes it his personal mission to save her. She has been captured by the lesser known as \u2018O\u2019 and he is more than obsessed with Bella. Zadist doesn\u2019t give up no matter what, and he finds Bella against all odds. Once Zsadist rescues Bella, she won\u2019t let him leave her. He tries to get Phury to take care of her, but she wants no one but Z. My poor Z... he just can\u2019t handle the feelings Bella has for him, or the feelings he is starting to develop for her. We learn much more about Z\u2019s ugly past and why he feels the way he does. Bella wants him, needs him, but he pushes her away. No matter what she says or does, he still feels unworthy, unclean. \u201cI love you.\" Z squeezed his eyes shut. \"Don't be a tragedy, Bella.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m filthy. I am so very dirty. I am dirty, dirty... Can\u2019t you see the dirt? I see it everywhere. It coats me. It seals me in. I can feel it on my skin-\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want this for you. All this... ugliness.\u201d Z broke my heart. His story crushed me. He is so beautiful on the inside, I couldn\u2019t take all the self-hatred. He keeps pushing, and eventually, he pushed Bella too far. I felt so bad for that poor soul. But he tries to do better for Bella and for himself. Then when he finds out (view spoiler) [Bella is with his child :D (hide spoiler) ] he knows he has to do even more. The transformation he makes is incredible. So many happy tears at the end of this one! My most favorite part (view spoiler) [ (hide spoiler) ] \u201cYou are the one. For her, you are the one.\u201d There is a lot more going on besides Bella and Z\u2019s story of course... We get a lot of Phury in this book, and we get introduced to someone named Revhenge, who I\u2019m sure we will see more of later down the line! I loved getting to see more of John- don\u2019t know what it is about him, but I LOVE that kid! Along with Z and Bella\u2019s heartbreaking story, something even more tragic happens (view spoiler) [Tohr\u2019s shellan dies :( I cried a good bit at that part... (hide spoiler) ] This was truly one of the most beautiful stories I have ever read. I can\u2019t even put it into words how much I loved it. Probably my favorite PNR ever. If the rest of the series is even half as good as this book, then I can\u2019t wait to get to it! The epilogue was just wonderful!

If I was choose to drop the F BOMB in any review, this book would be IT ... I loved this book, if I haven't quite made myself clear yet, then let me just tell you I have an unhealthy Fixation on all things BROTHERHOOD. This is (so far) my favourite book and brother of the series, and if possible I'm more addicted then ever. Zsadist THE ultimate in the alpha kingdom of vampires ~ Broken, destroyed, scarred, damaged, dark, dangerous and I LOVED him. Zsadist is my favourite of the brotherhood and his story stole my thoughts, feelings and book heart. I loved delving more into the brotherhood world and the author has a brilliant talent of bringing other characters into the limelight as the story develops. In this instalment we see more action and drama and definitely more of the 'lesser' soulless beings, yes the alphabet crew O, X, U, M etc play their staring roles in the book and I actually enjoyed reading about their part to play more in this book than I did the previous two. What grabs me about this series is the real hand on heart, honest to goodness friendship between the characters. The Brotherhood has me in laughter and tears in equal measure and this book showcases it to a fine art. Once again great story telling, a little more angsty and gritty and I found myself more nervous of the outcome of Zsadists journey, lets say 'on the edge of your seat' reading experience. There wasn't much if anything at all that i didn't LOVE about this book, but my favourite scene was the First kiss. Yes all out epic first kiss, my heart melted and I was in a puddle like state. So what's this crazy fang like story all about you ask? Take a vampire, a dark, dangerous one who has seen the world in all it's darkness and cruelty, mix in some yummy brothers (the kind that are protecting its race). Bring along a beautiful she-vamp who falls into danger (she's also a top tastic character ~ sassy, gorgeous and a go getter). Throw in tonnes of action, bloody drama, knock your socks off romance, tickle you pink love and a few grab your tissues scenes and here we have it ~ a bloody great black dagger package! (please revert to authors blurb, i'm sure it will make more sense). If this hasn't convinced you, check out my favourite quotes: \u2764\u2764\u201cI was dead until you found me, though I breathed. I was sightless, though I could see. And then you came...and I was awakened.\u201d \u2764\u2764\u201cShe is more beautiful than I have words for. And last night, I was blessed beyond measure to serve her.\u201d \u2764\u2764\u201cSometimes your whole life could hinge on a fraction of an inch. Or the beat of a nanosecond. Or the knock on a door.\u201d \u2764\u2764\u201cDedicated to: You. There will never be another like you. For me...you are the one. Yeah, I don't have enough words for this....\u201d So don't wait any longer to dive into this series if you haven't already (I do realise I'm a tad slow on the uptake with these books). A paranormal romance with plenty of bite (see what I did there?). 5 ALL OUT FAVOURITE BROTHER STARS.

It is my love of such characters that is at the root of my adoration of Zsadist. He is the brother who is, if not the most feared, certainly the most shied away from; a monster of a man with a zagged scar running down his face and obsidian eyes that see everything and like nothing. He sits on the fringe of the Brotherhood, never appearing to really be one of them. An outsider even within the warrior class of his kind. I'm not broken, I'm ruined. Do you understand the difference? With broken maybe you can fix things. Ruined? All you can do is wait to bury me.\u201d LOVER AWAKENED is his story, and it is VERY dark at times. Zsadist\u2019s history is anything but sunshine and roses; as his scarring and blood slave bands paint quite a vivid picture of. However, there is also an innocence to him, and it is the contradiction of these two qualities that I find the most appealing. TRIGGER WARNING: RAPE There have been few times in fiction when I have felt the addition of past rape or sexual abuse to a love arc was necessitated or handled correctly. And while I wouldn\u2019t say that LOVER AWAKENED doesn\u2019t have moments that leak into my frustration of rape-used-as-plot point, they remain moments never elevating to a level of true infuriation. At the risk of becoming spoilery I will say that I can appreciate a few choices made here; 1) being that the love interest of the survivor is not a complete dunce and does in fact recognize what is going on without having to be told outright and 2) does not get pissed off for NO FUCKING REASON when said survivor has reactions that are possibly frustrating but entirely understandable given same history. He was not capable of love. But the hatred he had he would channel for Bella until the last breath left his lungs Normally I loathe romance stories where one, or both, of the parties feel some ridiculous need to push the person they love away from them; here however I understand it. There is a stain that comes with sexual abuse, not in actuality - don\u2019t start flogging me - but within the head of the survivor, and it can take a toll on the relationships (intimate and otherwise) that person has in their life. Given the histories of the parties involved I can understand the hesitation, the forceful shoves in opposite directions and the distances created by fear. It\u2019s no secret that LOVER AWAKENED (and Zsadist, always Z) is my favourite of the BDB series, and that is likely because while the severity and intensity of the situations vary, I find much of the internal struggles and pain understandable because I too know what it feels like to want to chop all my hair off, to stand in the shower scrubbing myself raw with soap, to stare out into the world with eyes blank but for a hardened hatred. ---- Pre-Review ---- (I stole this image from another reviewer's status of another book, because it is PERFECT) \u2665 ...more 5++ stars - Vampire Romance Lover Awakened is my top favorite in the BDB series.

He past to finding his way back from the darkness in his soul to the light was a emotional rollercoaster for me. The amount of abuse he endured was heartbreaking. I definately thought that he had found his \"shellan\" with Bella, they are so well matched. Bella is another heroine I actually liked. F Amazing. Do these books keep getting better? I was warned by Mom that I would need some tissues with this one. She was right. I can't say that Zsadist is my favorite brother. I love his tormented soul.

I definately thought that he had found his \"shellan\" with Bella, they are so well matched. Bella is another heroine I actually liked. From her unbelievable patience with him to her inner-strength she has as a woman...er vampire I really liked her. I found myself rooting for her to get her man. I thought she and Zsadist were so well written and perfect for one another. I have to say that the backstory in this book is so interesting. Watching the brothers endure personal loss and develop their own strengths is spellbounding. I have to say that when the deaths of...well I won't spoil that, broke my heart. Phury's inner torment has me so intrigued....and actually one of my favorite characters is John. I have a feeling there is more to him that meets the eye. I think they deserve some happiness. I still liked Rhage the best...whew what a man! Wrath is right up there too...although I now have a pretty special place in my heart for Zsadist...he deserved his happy ending...and I am so glad he found it with Bella. ...more If I hear someone say \" what's doing? \" in real life, I'm pretty sure I will punch them in the face.

You get a point of view chapter, your second cousin twice removed gets a point of view chapter , EVERYBODY GETS A POINT OF VIEW CHAPTER . There was goodness in here, I had a severe case of the feels with all the Z backstory and the shit he was put through. I give Z all the stars for being an excellently flawed leading man. However, he and his romance with Bella didn't get nearly enough page time. Sure, some of this is due to him and Bella doing the ermegerd we can't actually communicate our feelings so the other one must totally hate me/want me to bond with his brother/never see me again/was never attracted to me at all thing, but in general the love story took a backseat in this book. Which sucks, because I quite enjoyed Z's experience with Bella's magical healing vagina . I actually read the lessers parts in this book and I quite enjoyed how much of a freaking weirdo O was. I also really, really like John. He's the only one who's story I really want to read after this one... Except maybe V's. We will see. Oh and I want to punch Phury in his phucking phace. PHUCK YOU . The ending of this was a cheesetastic cheese fondue and it actually made me want to vomit a little bit. And I phucking love cheese, so that's saying something. Z gets all the stars, the rest of the story gets -100 for being a regurgitation of the first one. 2.5 magic-healing-vagina Stars Thanks for the buddy read Heather ! ...more This book is pretty darn awesome. Zsadist is definitely one to seduce a reader if you love tortured, sexy heroes. The only disadvantage is too much Lesser narrative. Otherwise I love it! It is full of passages that wrench at your heart as you read Zsadist's sad but ultimately triumphant story. You really root for Zsadist to accept the unconditional love that Bella has for him, as you see him give all of himself to her because he cannot help but love her, even believing he is far from good enough This book is pretty darn awesome. Zsadist is definitely one to seduce a reader if you love tortured, sexy heroes. The only disadvantage is too much Lesser narrative. Otherwise I love it!

You really root for Zsadist to accept the unconditional love that Bella has for him, as you see him give all of himself to her because he cannot help but love her, even believing he is far from good enough for her. And the relationship is not one-sided as Zsadist helps Bella to heal from her captivity with the Lesser. He is the only one that can help her through this ordeal. But long before she was kidnapped, she was drawn to Zsadist. You see the seeds of their connection start in Lover Eternal, and to be honest, that's what made me keep reading Lover Eternal. I was so fascinated by the interaction between essentially The Beauty and the Beast played out in this sophistocated, urban vampire universe. I knew that their relationship would be explosive and captivating, and I was right. The scenes of Bella and Zsadist during her needing are enthralling and sexual, but also tender and poignant. I don't think any man could love a woman more than Zsadist loves Bella. The ending will make the sternest, most cold-hearted person tear up as Zsadist very clearly shows just how much Bella means to him. And the gift that Bella gives Zsadist is just the icing on the cake. This is a wonderful love story. ...more MIND BLOWN \u201cI was dead until you found me, though I breathed.

Ward has a crazy habit of getting under my skin with these books. For all the humor and playfulness of the Brothers, there is never a shortage of hard-hitting plot line. Even though this is the third book I've read in the series, I'm still amazed by how amazing and well written the Black Dagger Brotherhood Series is. You know what else? - Strong female characters (that's right, multiple strong women) - Edge of your seat action and suspense - So much love (brotherly love, loyalty, compassion, & sacrifice) - The character development is outstanding - Z's story was moving and emotional without being unbearable angsty - The story lines weave through each book, so 1. No Cliffhangers 2. Our favorite characters continue with the series \u201cYour hands on a gun butt right now, isn't it? Afraid of me?\u201d \u201cJust want to make sure I can take care of you.\u201d \u201cOh, really?\u201d \u201cYeah, in case you need Glock-to-mouth-resuscitation.\u201d All of the flashbacks which filled in the history of Zsadist and his brother Phury were beautifully incorporated. Their respective histories had been hinted at in the first two books, but it was so awesome to see how the twins came together through tragedy. The last quarter of the book was so packed with emotion, I could hardly contain myself\u2026 I won't give anything away, but these books never shy away from intensity. They really hit you where it hurts sometimes. I never see these twists coming, and I'm right these with the rest of the Brotherhood, soaking up the outcomes... \u201cI'm not broken, I'm ruined. Do you understand the difference? With broken maybe you can fix things. Ruined? All you can do is wait to bury me.\u201d Here's the amazing thing about the Black Dagger Brotherhood - there are so many characters, so many motives, backstories, curses to bear\u2026 Everyone gets their chance to share their point of view, and you can't help but get wrapped up in their stories. Even the bad guys get their shot at giving their POV - and I was enraptured. I hated David/O, but man oh man, I loved seeing the world through his psychotic eyes. The fact that J.R. Ward can get me emotionally attached (for better or worse) to all of these characters really speaks to the quality of her writing. And now I have to add a new tag\u2026 \"favorite romantic series\" to the Black Dagger Brotherhood. I'm going to snuggle up with a bottle glass of wine and try to come down from this serious book hangover before moving on to Lover Revealed \u2026 I'm just not mentally ready yet...

All the brotherhood are alpha men and they ooze hotness and sex appeal which gives us a panty dripping read...in this book we have the Needing , Bella's Needing\u2026.(the brotherhood are adorable when they discuss it between themselves, lol) The Needing is THE fertile time for the ladies; it only happens once every 5 years and let me tell you... Painful... NEED... WANT... DESIRE... Excruciating... URGES... ...doesn't even come close to describing the ladies desperate need for a man and someone to ease the throbbing pain of sexual need between their legs!! And any man in the vicinity has a sudden desperate need for action.....wowza, it was so SEXY...I hope to experience the Needing again, PLEASE \u2665 It gives want and desire a whole new meaning \u2665 I loved finding out more about Bella and her character; her story with Zsadist, is truly beautiful. We also learn more about Zsadist's brother Phury and the trials and tribulations they have been through together all adding layers, character development and fabulous depth to the story. Phury is an amazing brother to Zsadist and so very, very wise. The author is all the time cleverly interweaving the story of the other brothers, giving us insight into their characters and stories, setting us up for our next thrilling instalment. I feel like J R Ward has sprinkled some magic on the Brotherhood series to make them addictive. I really enjoy them all the way through but from just before the half way mark, and that has been the case for all three books, I literally can\u2019t put them down\u2026real life gets in my way big time.
