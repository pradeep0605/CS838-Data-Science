The small Maine town of <+++>Empire Falls</+++> has seen better days. \u00a0The local and once booming timber and textile industries have run their course and all that remains is the abandoned and decrepit real estate of what once was. The blue collar workers of this small New England community struggle to find the few jobs remaining that allow them to keep the wolf at the door and food on the table, ever hopeful of revitalized opportunities. And it is here that we meet Miles Roby, manager of The Empire Grill. \u00a0Miles is a good and decent man who did not always dream of flipping burgers and taking care of the grill, in fact at one time he had promising opportunities slated for his future. \u00a0But then life,<---M> as it is wont to do</---M>, bit back and he answered an urgent call to return home from college and help care for his ailing Mother. The vast majority of \u00a0the real estate and by extension the job opportunities in Empire Falls are owned \u00a0and controlled by the Whiting family or to be more precise, Francine Whiting. This really is not a plot driven novel. \u00a0The real bounty here lay in the character development of the residents of Empire Falls that we largely come to know through Miles Roby. \u00a0And oh my word, what a treasure trove of characters they are. \u00a0So real and flawed, everyday folk, fleshed out so well by Russo\u2019s pen that you may find yourself recognizing a few of them within your own circle of associates, friends and family. \u00a0\u00a0Seriously I am so astounded by the raw talent on display here. \u00a0These people walk, talk and breathe, stagger and stink all over these pages. \u00a0And such a wide cast of people, each saddled with their own histories, beliefs, resentments, weaknesses, dreams and strengths and real life struggles. \u00a0I feel like I know them all intimately. When you get to know people that well, for better or worse, you care about what happens to them. And there is a lot going on here. \u00a0Miles is on the cusp of a divorce and his ex\u2019s future husband loves to hang about and taunt him. \u00a0His brother is a recovering addict and Miles just can\u2019t be sure he won\u2019t fall off the wagon. \u00a0Then there is his teenage daughter Tick who is spreading her own wings while coping with the ruins of her parents marriage. \u00a0His employer, the stoic Francine, maintains a strange hold over Miles and his father is the most colourful, odiferous vagrant you are ever likely to meet.<---F> \u00a0And so many more</---F>. What Russo has accomplished here in Empire Falls is nothing short of masterful. \u00a0It is a social novel on a grand scale that reflects real life issues with all the inherent joys and sorrows, beauty and blisters. \u00a0\u00a0This is epic storytelling that will extend its gracious arms in welcome \u00a0and bruise your battered, hopeful heart. ...more coup de foudre = A sudden unexpected event, especially an emotional one; love at first sight.

Empire Falls is about a small factory town in Maine (<---B>paper and textile mills</---B>), after the industry has packed its bags and left for a third world country. Left behind are the former workers, now haunting the derelict streets like zombies, emotionally drained and too tired to even consider starting over. The poster boy of Empire Falls is Miles Roby, a middle aged man who has been flipping burgers at the Empire Grill for twenty years. Brought back temporarily from a promising start in a Boston college by a family crisis, Miles is now struggling to keep the business afloat for his wealthy owner, to cope with divorce and with a teenage daughter, with a brother recovering from drug addiction, with a dad who is a grifter and a crook, with an old flame returning to town and with another old flame that is still ignoring his tentative advances. He also spends a lot of his time reminiscing about the past and about the wrong turns that had put him in this dead end spot. I will not try to explain more about the plot, other than mentioning that there is a lot of resentment and passion running like an undercurrent through the placid town, leading to a devastating conclusion. By following Miles Roby down memory lane, I have got to know not only the secret history of Empire Falls, but also the personal dramas of his friends and families. By the end of the story, I felt like I have also spend part of my life in a rundown industrial town (Ploiesti right now is nor exactly prosperous, not at the end of its tether either). This is for me the forte of Richard Russo : his empathy for these fallible people, his sharp insights delivered with a compassionate touch. I only have one quote to illustrate my point, but there are numerous others in the story that I left behind, focusing instead on the families and their troubles. Miles is watching his daughter\u2019s schoolmates sitting at a table in his diner: My God, he couldn\u2019t help thinking, how terrible it is to be that age, to have emotions so near the surface that the slightest turbulence causes them to boil over. That, very simply, was what adulthood must be all about \u2013 acquiring the skill to bury things more deeply. Out of sight and, whenever possible, out of mind. Empire Falls is not a happy story, although it does occasionally remembers to laugh or to be tender. The major tonality is one of loneliness and sadness, and this is why I was reminded of how a picture can paint a thousand words, and why I decided that the best way to capture the impression it made on me is to include some artwork in my review: - how I imagine Empire Falls, the town: - how I imagine Empire Grill, the diner: - Tick and her boyfriend in the evening: the isolated house by the railroad (yes, there is one spooky house in the novel): Miles Roby's wife: Miles Roby's mother, as a young woman: ** all images copyright Edward Hopper ...more Empire Falls, Maine is a town that\u2019s best days are long behind it.

The mill and factory that used to be the main employers have been closed for years, and the only person around with two dimes to rub together is the very rich Francine Whiting who essentially owns and controls everything worth having in the area. Miles Robey was on the verge of earning his college degree and escaping Empire Falls forever when he returned home to care for his dying mother and ended up working for Mrs. Whiting as the manager of the Empire Grill. Two decades later and Miles is a middle aged punching bag still slinging burgers who probably bursts into tears every time he hears Pearl Jam\u2019s Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town . His selfish wife Janine is divorcing Miles to marry health club owner Walt Comeau who likes to stop by the Empire Grill every afternoon to rub it in. Miles\u2019 father Max is the town neer-do-well who is impervious to guilt and is constantly trying to get money out of him. Town cop Jimmy Minty starts approaching Miles under the guise of friendship but has some long simmering grudge against him. Worst of all is that Miles has to report the slender profits to Mrs. Whiting even as she refuses to pay for any improvements to the increasingly shabby diner. The one bright spot in life for Miles is his teen-aged daughter Tick who he loves dearly and has a close relationship with. This is the first book I\u2019ve read by Russo (Although I\u2019ve seen the movie version of Nobody\u2019s Fool .), and I absolutely loved it. At least until the ending, but we\u2019ll get to that shortly. The depiction of a small blue collar town slowly going under was done incredibly well from the opening that describes how Empire Falls has been ruled by the Whitings for generations and how heir C.B. went from his dream of wanting to be a poet and artist in Mexico to running the family business and marrying Francine. The characters are another big selling point because there\u2019s a lot more than I described in the brief summary above, and all of them seem rich and fully developed. It\u2019s to Russo\u2019s credit that he was able to make a cast that includes some absolutely infuriating and unpleasant people and make you at least understand all of them. There were times where I wished that Miles would push his father out of a moving car or toss a pan full of hot grease into the face of Walt, but there was also a certain obnoxious charm to them most of the time. Miles is the heart of the book, and I was a little worried that I wasn\u2019t going to like him much in the early going. I\u2019m generally not a fan of passive characters that are so wrapped up in regrets and unearned guilt that they\u2019re essentially just pawns for anyone looking to use them, and Miles fits this description to a T. Being raised Catholic by his selfless mother has convinced him that wanting anything is practically a sin, and he\u2019s almost pathologically incapable of standing up for himself. However, Miles\u2019 brother is constantly calling him out for taking the path of least resistance and urging him to at least try to change his circumstances. That awareness of his nature and the flashes of backbone that Miles shows at times make him sympathetic despite being pretty much a doormat. As far as the ending (view spoiler) [ I loved that Mrs. Whiting had essentially turned Miles into an indentured servant because of the affair his mother had with her husband. Miles seemed exceptionally slow on the uptake there, but the hardest place to see a trap is from inside it. However, I was less pleased with other elements. John Voss shooting the people in the high school was the kind of dramatic moment that it would take for Miles to make a big gesture like leaving Empire Falls to protect Tick. So while I wasn\u2019t sold on the idea of this character driven story about small town secrets and regrets turning into a ripped-from-the-headlines tragedy, it made sense in that respect. But I didn\u2019t like how everything got kind of deus ex machina after that. Mrs. Whiting drowns, Jimmy Minty is disgraced, Zach gets shipped off to Seattle, Janine leaves Walt all while David and Bea get the new restaurant going. That all just seemed a little too convenient for Miles. (hide spoiler) ] Despite those complaints this was still an exceptionally well written book with that did a great job establishing and exploring all the tangled relationships in one dying town, and it has enough humor to keep everything from getting overly grim and depressing for the most part. It\u2019s easy to see why it won a Pulitzer. ...more In this past year of reading I\u2019ve found it easy to get through a book quickly, decide whether I enjoyed it or not, and move on to the next book in the infinite pile.

It In this past year of reading I\u2019ve found it easy to get through a book quickly, decide whether I enjoyed it or not, and move on to the next book in the infinite pile. Most books I\u2019ll read in a week or so, and I approach my leisure time in a workman-like manner: it is relaxation time, but it also follows a pretty regular schedule. Rare are the books that cause me to slow down and delay finishing a novel simply to prolong the enjoyment provided by its reading. Empire Falls is that type of book. It is the perfect type of book for winter: it moves at a leisurely pace, is rich in character, and has absolutely stunning writing. Empire Falls is a close as you can get to a perfect novel. But a pitch-perfect novel is not exactly what you\u2019d expect from reading the synopsis printed on the back of the novel. Miles Roby is a soon-to-be-divorced manager at the Empire Grill trying to raise his high school-age daughter (Tick) in rural Maine. Miles is stuck under the thumb of Mrs. Whitting, a local woman who owns much of the town\u2019s real estate, businesses, and a good deal of the populace. There\u2019s a plot, but the novel builds a story that revolves around character, and it is those characters that propel the book forward. Man, oh man, are the characters ever impressive. Miles is whom the reader spends the most time with, and the conflict between his desire for a better life and the desire to be a good man is at the heart of the story. While I loved Miles, what is truly impressive is that Russo brings to life an entire town in entirely believable detail. You\u2019ll remember Max Roby and be able to share Miles\u2019 disdain for his father. But you\u2019ll also know Max and feel a familiar excitement for his appearances and the humorously twisted moral compass he employs. Each and every character, even in the most minor of appearances, feels as if they could walk in your door as soon as you put the book down. My grandfather and I did a buddy read for this book. We both remarked that we knew so many of characters as they hewed so closely to the people from the rural lives we had lived. The writing here is, as I\u2019ve mentioned, breathtaking in its beauty and insight. Russo has packed a lot into this almost-500-page novel, and not a word of it feels wasted. He effortlessly moves from a scene at the grill, to a brief accounting of a newly arrived character\u2019s life, and back to the scene without ever making me feel like the story meandered. So much of the beauty of the book comes from Russo\u2019s ability to build an entire town piece by piece, with POVs from characters that range in social standing and disposition, each serving to highlight another aspect of Empire Falls. Russo also makes profound and poignant statements in the novel that make for some of the most personally genuine writing I\u2019ve ever read. I started at first to jot down passages I wanted to include in this review, but gave up after 100 pages. There\u2019s just too much here to bother trying to include it all. I can\u2019t begin to recall how many times I finished a chapter, set the book down, and just took a bit of time to ponder what I\u2019d just read. As for themes , Empire Falls deals with all the big stuff you\u2019d expect to see from Pulitzer Prize-winning fiction. Miles is pulled between duty and desire throughout the entire novel, but his inertia constantly keeps him from acting in any major way to affect change in his life. Russo deals with the events in life that shape complex adults from the supple clay of childhood. He examines morality from all different angles, with all of his characters caught in some sort of ethically gray squabble throughout the story. Not all the characters make the right decisions, but I would never fault Russo as the decisions are always backed up by the characters\u2019 upbringing, personality, or recent changes in their lives. Life, death, what makes a good life, and the influence we have on others. It\u2019s a heavy set of themes that Russo deals with in admirable fashion. To bring it all home, Empire Falls is simply one of the best novels I\u2019ve ever read, and possibly the best novel I\u2019ve read in 2016. I loved the characters, the setting, and the overlapping pursuits, desires, and interactions of the township make for a novel that never once bored me through the entire read. The book is long, I\u2019ll give you that, but it is more patient than slow, and embracing that patience yielded one of the most rewarding reading experiences I\u2019ve had all year. Should you exercise the same patience, you too will be rewarded with an absolutely breathtaking novel. ...more I\u2019ve really fallen in love with the characters in this one. To me, the most difficult thing to do in literature is develop a character. Character-driven novels are a gamble because if they are not handled correctly, they can crash and burn before they\u2019ve taken off.

I liked Empire Falls primarily because of how real Miles and Max and Mrs. Whiting, etc. felt to me. This book encompasses what it must have been like (although I\u2019m only imagining here) to live in a small New England town suffering through a period of economic decay. It is depressing, and yet it isn\u2019t\u2014 because of the characters. Somehow Miles inspires hope in the reader, and Max\u2019s frustrating personality actually serves to make a point (in addition to providing comic relief), which is that you don\u2019t actually have to take life so seriously. I mean, you can if you want. But you don\u2019t have to. And even Mrs. Whiting speaks volumes. She may be vicious and manipulative on the surface, but the more the reader discovers about her, the more he is able to empathize with her. She has struggled more than any other character in the novel and yet she presents herself stoically. How very \u201cNew England\u201d of her. And so do we find out for sure whether there\u2019s a heart of gold underneath all that armor? Nope! Because really, not much happens in this story plot-wise. But it almost doesn\u2019t matter because it is the great set of characters in this book that, for me, made it most enjoyable. ...more This was a book my brother really enjoyed and recommended to me as recently as this summer.

When I finish a book, I find I kind of have to let things simmer in my brain a bit before I can really parse out all my reactions to it. I\u2019m not sure why, but this one took me a little longer than usual. I think that it may be that the book didn\u2019t really have one big point to make \u2013 rather, it was more an interweaving of lots of little points, that all weave together in a portrait of everyday life in a particular time and place. I liked the book tremendously. I enjoyed the pace and the mood, and felt the author has a very natural sense of tone that communicates volumes about his characters and their situations in a mostly unobtrusive and seamless way. I also appreciated that he was able to write many of his characters in such a way that the reader is able to like them and sometimes empathize with them, even when they are not being particularly likeable. I found that I had developed an affection for characters even when they were occasionally \u2013 or more than occasionally \u2013 annoying. Kind of like with real people I know. :) This is a feature I really liked in the novel. My first and most frequent response as I was reading the book was to hear in my head Thoreau\u2019s line that \u201cThe mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\u201d Empire Falls is clearly a whole town living lives of quiet desperation. Though I think Thoreau meant it in terms of people being trapped by the daily grind, or leading an unexamined, insufficiently spiritually-nurturing kind of life. Whereas I mean it more in the sense of someone become ossified in ordinariness, having given up on their dreams, or not daring to dream at all. Miles Roby, the central character of Empire Falls, gave up on his dreams as a young man, and has become rooted in Empire Falls. Although he doesn\u2019t walk around despairing of his life or choices, and does keep alive some hopes (however unrealistic) for the future, he has become settled into his small town life and narrow-bordered existence. Several other characters are undone by disappointed dreams \u2013 Grace Roby, who once gets tantalizingly close to the realization of a dream, only to have the rest of her life tainted by its failure to realize; Janine Roby, who leaves her husband in pursuit of a dream that ends up disappointing her; Tick Roby, who is in serious danger of giving up on her dreams before she has really even had the chance to take them out for a spin. Inertia plays a key role in this sense of quiet desperation in the novel \u2013 inertia at times braided with wishful thinking. Over and over again, we see characters stuck in a particular pattern of behavior, with apparently no prospect for breaking out of their patterns. The characters that are the most tragic or pathetic (I\u2019m not sure which, or even if it\u2019s possible to distinguish between the two) are those who are or become trapped by their own wishful thinking. Miles, again, is the chief example of this, but you also see it in Cindy Whiting, Janine, Charlie Whiting, and even Max Roby. And, inertia in this story is true to its nature \u2013 it takes an out-of-the-ordinary event to knock loose inertia and set things back in motion. Which is all beginning to sound like a fairly gloomy book, as I look over what I\u2019ve written. But it\u2019s not doom and gloom. It is, rather, a very human story about human relationships. And as much as you see in the book about human foibles, you also see moments of ordinary human grace. On the one hand, the book is full of all the secrets \u2013 petty and not so petty \u2013 that populate daily life, whether we keep them out of personal shame, or because of our uncertainty about whether telling or keeping a secret is more hurtful to others. On the other hand, the book is also full of quiet acts of self-sacrifice that some of these secrets entail, whether in the keeping or the telling (for example, David Roby keeping a secret from his brother in order to protect him.) My one dissatisfaction with the book (not bad enough to call it a complaint) had to do with the final act. Although there needed to be a turning point event to knock Miles Roby out of his inertia, I think the author went a bit over the top. I didn\u2019t think it was terrible, but I do think that was the one weak spot of the story. Two random, disconnected thoughts that I wanted to mention but I couldn\u2019t find anywhere to fit these in nicely into my review: Disconnected Thought 1: Francine Whiting reminds me of no one more than the Mary Carson character in The Thorn Birds, especially as played by Barbara Stanwyck. Disconnected Thought 2: There is a brilliant moment in Miles' final scene with Cindy Whiting, in which Cindy calls Miles out for pitying her, and for automatically assuming that she had never had any other romantic possibilities. Up until that moment, Miles has only ever seen Cindy as a cut-out, taking for granted that she had no existence beyond him, and suddenly, in an instant, she is revealed as a three-dimensional human being. That moment is so surprising for the reader it almost catches your breath, and the reader is left feeling supremely uncomfortable, as uncomfortable as Miles is at that moment, because the reader is exposed right alongside Miles \u2013 as Cindy's accusation reveals exactly what we have been thinking all along. Finally one quote, which actually stands in for a much longer recurring motif: \u201cThe passenger seat and floor of the Jetta were now paint-flecked, thanks to Max\u2019s refusal to change into clean clothes when they quit for the day. He made no distinction between work clothes and other clothes, and since he had started helping Miles at St. Cat\u2019s, the old man\u2019s shirts and pants and shoes were all paint-smudged. When people pointed this out, he offered his customary \u201cSo what?\u201d Few men, Miles reflected, lived so comfortably within the confines of a two-word personal philosophy.\u201d -- pg. 204-205 ...more Big novel about a little place in Maine.

Too much of the storytelling is pedestrian, though Russo can handle both description and characterization ably when he wants to, he often settles for a speedwritten, colloquial prose that doesn\u2019t come to life. And there is a meanness embedded in his descriptions of some characters (the Whitings, the Mintys, Janine Roby and her new husband) that borders on hypocrisy when balanced with the forbearance he presents some characters, whose behaviors, or at least motives seem not too far different from the less favored. Janine, for example, seems as abandoned and mis-served by marriage as the mother of Miles Roby, her husband, had been served by her marriage. One is tragic and the other pathetic. Despite going out of its way to make sure we share seemingly everyone\u2019s opinion, including her mom and her daughter, that Janine is a fool, there is never any effort to elicit sympathy for a woman who became involved with a man who never loved her, worked cheek-by-cheek with the woman he always loved, and who has never managed to step up to the plate in any significant way. The book ends with a long anticipated and digressively presented Columbine shooting and, in its wake, at least the possibility that Janine and Miles may reconcile and the town\u2019s fortunes are rebounding sufficiently to allow life to go on. None of it seems organic, just one writer\u2019s idea of a complicated story played out in a small town with some emblematic meaning for our post-industrial world. ...more Winner of the 2002 Pultizer Prize, this novel has been reviewed many, many times in the last decade.

That's not to say there's any reason to compare it to Twilight. It's not about vampires or in the same genre or league. The Maine town of Empire Falls is probably like many Rust Belt cities where residents who stayed behind struggle to get by and wonder what they missed by not leaving. Miles, the main character, almost made it out when he went away to college, but he came home to care for his dying mother. Two decades later he's still managing the local diner, where much of the novel is based. His wife has left him for the owner of the local gym, the woman he's loved since high school thinks he's too nice a guy to ever date. It'd be easy to feel sorry for him, but he's too smart and pulled together to take pity on and you know they're the ones losing out. The novel moves at a small town pace. But honestly, the plot, while it holds together and left me wondering what was coming, isn't that important. There's a lot going on, but I didn't feel overwhelmed trying to keep up with everything. It's like Russo has dropped the reader into this world to grab a seat at the diner and watch small town life unfold. But it's not really the cliche small town life we all know, it's more modern and tarnished. Russo writes so beautifully and with empathy for his characters, who are allowed to have conflicting emotions and behavior, sometimes all at the same time. By the end I was sad to leave because I knew these people and they were so enjoyable to follow. I really hated Max for most of the book, but then it's not that his character changes, but you see him in a new light and by then end, I liked him, though he still drove me crazy. I was a bit envious of Russo who seems to be able to pin people and their feelings down so well. Sure, he's creating these characters so he should know their dearest secrets and every emotion, but they're so realistically written that it feels like he's reading the mind of an actual person. I could go on, but really, just read it. I think I'm in love with this book. Here's a line I love from it that is kind of the point: Lives are rivers. We imagine we can direct their paths, though in the end there's but one destination, and we end up being true to ourselves only because we have no choice. ...more Bittersweet story about everyday life in a small town, or so it seems. I have to admit that I was a little bored at the beginning of it (the prologue was a little dry, in my opinion), but once I got into the present-day scenario, Russo gradually brought the storyline to a powerful culmination and held my interest to the end. 3.5\u2605 I am somewhat conflicted in my response to this one. A lengthy pulitzer prize winner brimming with small town Americana and loved by many, I was often distracted while reading with the tedious detail and slow pace of this character-driven novel.

A lengthy pulitzer prize winner brimming with small town Americana and loved by many, I was often distracted while reading with the tedious detail and slow pace of this character-driven novel. It seemed way longer than 483 pages. But Russo is a great writer and there were passages of sheer brilliance, humor, and heartbreak depicting working class people in a dying town. Empire Falls is controlled by a rich black widow who owns it all and has the townspeople, especially Miles, spun up in cocoons to feed on when she needs to express her venom. Every character, even her cat, is painstakingly portrayed. Perhaps a case of too much of a good thing? Cut to the chase was running though my thoughts and my patience at times was tried; how many more pages to go? Yet I never wanted to quit. As is often the case, a great writer can have his way with the reader and the destination often justifies the journey getting there. A slow burner that eventually started to boil with a denouement that left me quite satisfied. Al a carte There is a 2 part movie adaptation done by HBO in 2005 with an all star cast and screenplay done by the author (which at the time of this posting is available for rental or free streaming to Amazon Prime members). I checked it out and thought it very well done, perhaps better than the book (I know what you're thinking). Perfect if you want to experience an abbreviated version of the story. Perhaps worth noting that husband was bored half way through Part I and left to clean up the kitchen. I was good with that. Guessing he won't be reading the book either. https://www.amazon.com/Empire-Falls-P... ...more I bought this book having only read on the back of it's cover and seeing that it had won the Pulitzer. I half-way expected to find it sligthly boring for that same reason, simpy because I tend to like books with a fair amount of action. And \"Empire Falls\" has very little action. But man, this book is so well written, I had to stop and curse out loud several times, being a writer myself. Small, everyday situations become intensely interesting, as the web of relationships becomes apparent.

Small, everyday situations become intensely interesting, as the web of relationships becomes apparent. It felt almost like reading a soap opera, but with great actors and a huge budget. I simply had to know, what happened next to the people in this little town. And when the book ended, I still wanted to know more. That more than anything, marks a great novel. The only reason, I don't give it a full five stars, is because of some of the flashback chapters. They serve a purpose, but also took the pace down, sometimes to the point of boredom. When I did put this novel down, it was often during one of these chapters. But all in all, Empire Falls is a great American novel in its original sense. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. ...more 2.5 Stars Empire Falls by Richard Russo is a story about relationships and life in a small town called Empire Falls in Maine.

I think as the story unfolded and the details of small town life played out it seemed to drag on forever and I became bored and found myself page counting about 3/4 way through the book. What started out as an interesting and entertaining read became tedious and I looked forward to finishing the story. To sum up I found the writing and the character development excellent and I enjoyed how he portrayed relationships in this small town.

How do you tell yourself \u201cI have a happy life\u201d when you know that what you yearned will never be? How do you start every morning with a smile? How do you keep afloat? Empire Falls is the story of a small town who dreamed less than they should, and the few people who did and were the worse for it. It\u2019s the story of unrealized dreams, an unrealized love, and an undone marriage. It\u2019s the story of those who stayed, lookin How do you cope with life when all your dreams stayed as they are, just dreams? How do you tell yourself \u201cI have a happy life\u201d when you know that what you yearned will never be? How do you start every morning with a smile? How do you keep afloat? Empire Falls is the story of a small town who dreamed less than they should, and the few people who did and were the worse for it. It\u2019s the story of unrealized dreams, an unrealized love, and an undone marriage. It\u2019s the story of those who stayed, looking for anything stable in a place where, as the name suggests, everything falls. \u201c\u2018Power and Control\u2019 Mrs. Whiting repeated, a smile playing at her lips.\u201d The mantra of the most powerful entity in Empire Falls proved to be her undoing. For like the great C.B.\u2019s attempt on the Knox River, one cannot control life\u2019s stream nor tamper with its power. Sometimes we think we do, sometimes we think we can overpower our dreams into fruition by sheer will, sometimes we think we can control life, but that is not always the case. Those times are but momentary lulls in a river raging with life. For if the untamable river of life makes empires, like Mrs. Whiting, fall. The same can happen to you and me. Life is like the River Knox, running, ebbing, and each flow different from the other. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you something else. What people around here like best about me? They like it that they\u2019re more like me than they are like you. They look at me and they see the town they grew up in. They see their first girlfriend. They see the first high school football game they ever went to. You know what they see when they look at you? That they ain\u2019t good enough. They look at you and see everything they ever done wrong in their lives. They hear you talk and maybe they\u2019re thinking the same thing you are, except they can\u2019t say it like you do and they know they won\u2019t ever get credit. They see you and your buddy the principal with your heads together, deciding how things are gonna be, talking the way you talk and making your little jokes, and they know they\u2019ll never get no place with either of you, not ever. But me? Maybe they might just get someplace with me, and that\u2019s why they like me\u2026 They like my attitude, I guess you could say. And you know what? An attitude like yours? An attitude like yours leads to things.\u201d Of all the passages in this remarkable novel, this one had the most powerful impact on me. I confess that I\u2019m guilty of this particular folly. Having gone to one of the best universities in my country, I usually talk fancy or intellectually even when I should not. I see people crease their brows, misunderstand me and feel inferior. When I do, more often than not, I take pride in that. I now abhor this foolishness and the pride along with it. With knowledge comes wisdom, the understanding of its application. For knowledge alone negates itself with the stupidity of pride, then boastfulness. Now I understand that I have no right to look down on people just because my dreams bore fruition. What if it were not the case? How would I feel then? The truly enlightened know never to be boastful, lest the great waves of the river descend upon you and drift your dreams away. One should not turn into a nightmare a good dream. \u201cAnd there comes a time in your life when you realize that if you don't take the opportunity to be happy, you may never get another chance again.\u201d The thing is unfulfilled dreams, as with Miles, will always stay with you. It will always cast a shadow on your life. But you know what? Dream again. Yes, having your dream unrealized hurts. It feels like shit. But not dreaming again is even worse; it will deflate your will to carry on. Giving up, that\u2019s even shittier. Don\u2019t let the pain of an experience defeat you, let it teach you instead. So dream of a new grill for your diner, dream of losing weight, dream of sending your kids to college, dream of buying all those books you\u2019ve always wanted. Dream lots of things, because some of them are bound to come true. And it gets better. With your experience, you know that not every dream comes to pass. You\u2019re less vulnerable, more mature, and with age, your dreams tend to be less selfish. Because when you were younger, your dreams were more synonymous with wants, now they\u2019re much closer to hope. Maybe fortune is now more inclined to smile upon you. So how do you wake up every morning with a smile? You do so because just then, you were dreaming. \u201cAfter all, what was the whole wide world but a place for people to yearn for their hearts\u2019 impossible desires, for those desires to become entrenched in defiance of logic, plausibility, and even the passage of time, as eternal as polished marble?\u201d How do you tell yourself \u201cI have a happy life\u201d? Here\u2019s a little secret. You don\u2019t. There never is a happy life. Happiness is always momentary. Sometimes you\u2019ll be happy, sometimes not. What people do wrong is they search for this happiness in their life\u2019s entirety; but the answer is not to look, but to feel. Sight will always show you what you don\u2019t have, what you didn\u2019t become, what you failed to achieve, what\u2019s better than you. But when you close your eyes and dwell about everything, every experience, every moment, you might just feel that little thing called contentment. And when you do, my friend, you\u2019re one of the luckiest people on earth. How do you keep afloat? You stop fighting the current, let the river that is life carry you. ...more This is one of those rare occasions when I wish GoodReads were to offer half-star ratings, because then I could give \"Empire Falls\" four and a half stars. It was almost a five-star novel in my estimation, but I had a few quibbles with it. It's nevertheless an excellent book, and one I don't feel much need to review at length; my friend Jennifer, who both recommended the book to me and lent me her copy, has already written a brilliant assessment. Her review is at http://www.goodreads.com/review/s This is one of those rare occasions when I wish GoodReads were to offer half-star ratings, because then I could give \"Empire Falls\" four and a half stars.

It's nevertheless an excellent book, and one I don't feel much need to review at length; my friend Jennifer, who both recommended the book to me and lent me her copy, has already written a brilliant assessment. Her review is at http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... So what are my quibbles? They're not many, really, but I felt that, at times, Russo laid too much out for his readers. There is, for example, a scene in which David Roby details for his brother Miles the personality traits each sibling got from their father and which he received from their mother. It felt like something Russo should have allowed us, his readers, to figure out for ourselves. I wanted Russo to have more trust in his audience. Also, the book seemed to wrap up a bit too neatly; the lives Russo depicted were certainly messy, and they seemed to demand a less tidy conclusion. Still, the book, overall, is a staggering achievement. Russo has an amazing eye for the human condition -- how the way our parents raise us often determines our directions us for the rest of our lives, even if we think we're smart enough to see those risks and do our damnedest to choose our own paths anyhow. (The novel feels, at times, like a book-length meditation on the poem \"This Be The Verse,\" by Philip Larkin: \"They fuck you up, your mum and dad. / The may not mean to, but they do. They fill you with the faults they had / And add some extra, just for you.\") On a personal note, it was interesting to read Richard Russo's book at the same time I read George Eliot's \"Middlemarch.\" Both, by depicting the lives of tightly knit communities -- the births, deaths love affairs, marriages, educations, careers and dreams both failed and accomplished of the members of those communities -- get at the bigger truths of all our lives. Both Eliot and Russo have a gift for the sardonic, and make us develop an affection for characters who, objectively speaking, we should not like. There's no way we should want to spend time with Russo's Max Roby, yet Russo is such a talented writer that we not only suffer him but develop as much begrudging affection for him as his sons Miles and David have. I've already written more about \"Empire Falls\" than I intended to. Jennifer nailed it, and you should read her review instead. Then read the book. ...more A serious novel about small towns where everyone knows everyone else - and has for generations. I loved this book, as melancholy as it was. I loved the history of the characters and the town itself - although you really could not separate the two. Russo is one of my new favorite authors. He has such compassion for his characters. A sprawling, leisurely-told story with a large, well drawn cast of characters, Empire Falls caught and held my interest from the first page. Russo spends a great deal of time setting things up and introducing all the characters and subplots and I found myself truly caring about the characters and what happens to them as I read the book.

Russo spends a great deal of time setting things up and introducing all the characters and subplots and I found myself truly caring about the characters and what happens to them as I read the book. The book takes place in the fictional Maine town of Empire Falls. Once a thriving manufacturing center, the town has fallen onto hard times due to globalization and the outsourcing of the factory jobs that once supported the community. Russo does a good job of painting a picture of a blue-collar community living lives of quiet desperation without resorting to didacticism. There\u2019s definitely poignancy and empathy towards those living on the margins: ''They stayed, many of them, because staying was easier and less scary than leaving, and because for a while at least they'd be able to draw unemployment benefits. Others remained out of pride. When the realization dawned that they were the victims of corporate greed and global economic forces, they said, O.K., sure, fine, they'd been fools but they would not, by God, be run out of the town their grandparents and parents had grown up in and called home. The fortunate ones were older, their modest houses nearly paid off; close to retirement, they would limp to the finish line, then help their less fortunate sons and daughters as best they could.'' The main character is Miles Roby, a decent man who once had a bright future and a way to escape from his small town, but who ended up back in Empire Falls, managing a failing caf\u00e9 and impassively watching as his 20-year marriage fails also. Roby is a man living a life of quiet desperation and who isn\u2019t able to recognize it: \u201cI mean, if I were so unhappy, wouldn\u2019t I know?\u201d Unfortunately, for most of the novel, Miles doesn\u2019t know and it takes some long buried secrets coming to light to rouse him enough to make some needed changes in his life. Don\u2019t get the impression that the book is one long depressing slog. The book is actually very funny with lively dialogue and vibrant secondary characters that are well written.

There is a priest that is demented and he wants to hear confessionals so he can hear what is going on and then he tells others. Now I don't think that is nice. Sure it might happen in the real world but how often? There is Miles' alcoholic father who continually throws out cruel, snide criticisms of his son and others. Miles' mother has died of cancer and her death was painful and horrible for all. I find this depressing. I am not avoiding the reality of life, but what is the purpose of sinking myself into the worst of man's behavior. Mid-life crises kind of bore me. None of this is a spoiler since I have not gone far into the book. Neither have I even mentioned the prologue which was utterly disgusting. I don't find it appetizing to read about a decomposing moose, even if it leads C.B. to make a foolish decision - BTW, here I am just guessing. Let me point out that I never shy away from gruesome events in history, but what is the point here in reading about how people behave so cruelly to one another? What does that teach me? There is absolutely nothing exceptional about the writing; the author's ability to depict an emotion, a place or an event is just plain ordinary. This received a Pulitzer. Would somebody who loves this book explain to me why I should continue reading. I just do not understand. SHOULD I continue? I need advice. ***************************** After 14 chapters(about half of the book): So I continued; several said that Tick is a fabulous character. She plays a larger and larger role starting in Part Two. She cannot save this book for me. I find the humor not to my taste. I find the characters black or white - cardboard characters. It is simple to make two piles, the good ones and the bad ones. I cannot accept such characterization. People are complicated; they cannot be sorted in this manner. And the dialogs sound like those perfect for a popular weekly television series. Perfect sitcom dialogs. In desperation I went and read spoiler reviews...... No, what is coming is not up my alley either. Enough is enough. I will be reading no more books by Richard Russo. This is my third and last try. I listened to the audiobook narrated by Ron Mclarty. That was the only thing that was exceptional. Great narration. His intonation perfectly matched the lines. So if you want to read this book don't hesitate to choose the audio format and this narrator. ...more If future archaeologists have nothing but novels written over the past 20 years or so to judge our society by, they will come to the following conclusions: 1.

Nearly everyone used foul language (although perhaps the future archaeologists won't know that it was foul language). 2. Nearly everyone thought about sex most of the time. 3. Almost all adults were either divorced, in the process of getting a divorce, or remarried after having been divorced. 4. Young people spent a portion of their lives in a horrible place called \"high school,\" where all but a tiny elite were ostracized and mocked. (Was every author an outcast in high school?) All of the above applies to Richard Russo's \"Empire Falls.\" It also covers most of what I didn't like about the book. This left a lot to like. Russo offers a compelling narrative that is -- cliche alert -- hard to put down. He presents interesting characters, although perhaps they lack in depth. It's easy to tell who you're supposed to like and who you're not supposed to like. You're supposed to like the central character, Miles Roby, who runs the Empire Grill in Empire Falls, a town in Maine that appears to be in an irreversible decline. One of the central story lines involves Miles and his teenage daughter Christina, aka Tick. This relationship was the most attractive part of the book for me. I wanted to be a dad for a very long time, and I always pictured myself as the father of a daughter. So I tend to vicariously experience this relationship through nauseatingly sentimental movies such as \"Father of the Bride\" and \"My Girl\" and even in recent episodes of the \"Funky Winkerbean\" comic strip. Miles is sort of like the dad I picture myself to be, and Tick is sort of like the daughter I imagine. I like how Miles and Tick find \"unintentional humor in the form of gaffes in the Empire Gazette, misspellings in advertisements for local stores, lapses in logic on printed signs like the one on the brick wall that surrounded the old empty shirt factory: NO TRESPASSING WITHOUT PERMISSION.\" Russo writes some fine sentences, none better than the one at the beginning of Chapter 5, when we learn almost everything there is to know about Miles' father, Max: \"The donut shop in Empire Falls had always been one of Max Roby's favorite places because of its smoking policy, which was, 'Go ahead. See if we care.'\" Although \"Empire Falls\" is an easy read, Russo writes a few sentences that leave me saying: How's that again? For example: \"What Tick's coming to realize is that in some ways Zack's never been interested in her either, though not, she suspects, in the same way he's not interested in Candace.\" But maybe that's not such a bad sentence. Perhaps it reflects the way a teenage girl thinks. I wouldn't know. ...more The book begins with a brilliant and unforgettable image but becomes increasingly less memorable as the book continues. Russo's style is pleasantly lulling and subtle--appropriate especially here for the description of the slow demise of a midland maine town. But the book goes on too long, and the ending is completely unsatisfying. Richard Russo's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, Empire Falls , offers the best of what is largely considered pass\u00e9 in the American novel.

Rich characterization, hard-won insight and slow-seething drama vie for prominence in the story of Miles Roby - father, son, brother, ex-husband and manager of the Empire Grill, struggling to make a go of it in a small Maine township last-gasping its way to ruin. The style is conversational; the first hundred pages a gossipy chat that serves to introduce our major players while luring us into deeper psychological terrain. Neighbors, friends, enemies, lovers - these are ancient relationships; mighty oaks with deep and complicated root systems that have, for reasons nearly beyond comprehension, managed to weather the worst Nature had to offer and Fate brought along. While much is taken for granted among the residents of Empire Falls, secrets do indeed remain and buried memories itch to rise. Add to this a stellar B-story involving Tick, Miles' teenage daughter (which, quite frankly, puts most of the Young Adult fiction I've read to pure and abiding shame), and you've got a novel that grows harder and harder to close the cover on. This is everything I'm after when I'm hunting down the quintessential American tale. No cheap tricks or easy outs. Richard Russo has produced a work of substance that, at every single journeyman's turn, absolutely refused to insult my intelligence. ...more As I put down EMPIRE FALLS after its last page, it suddenly dawned on me: \"I have to read another book now, don't I.\" From the first page, I fell in love with the wonderful but flawed characters of Richard Russo's Pulitzer Prize-winner, and leaving the town of Empire Falls, Maine hit me with the force of parting with a dear friend. What I found to be really remarkable about this book is its ending, not because it's so action-packed (especially in comparison to the rest of the book) but because the reader's sense of foreboding builds so subtly throughout the book until one can figure out which character it will be to cause the inevitable catastrophe. Actually, this entire book could be a study in subtlety, because the nuances in each character are so lightly illustrated as to catch the unsuspecting reader off-guard. This is What I found to be really remarkable about this book is its ending, not because it's so action-packed (especially in comparison to the rest of the book) but because the reader's sense of foreboding builds so subtly throughout the book until one can figure out which character it will be to cause the inevitable catastrophe. Actually, this entire book could be a study in subtlety, because the nuances in each character are so lightly illustrated as to catch the unsuspecting reader off-guard. This is mainly due to the slowness of the dawnings of each revelation to the novel's main character, Miles Roby; in fact, even readers who typically skim (and this is a pretty big novel, so skimming for some is inevitable) can pick up subtle hints that show, for instance, who Charlie Mayne really is and who is Charlene's lover. Luckily, Miles eventually figures this out (at the very end of the book, of course)and more, so one can't be completely frustrated by his seemingly selective understanding of the things going on around him. Also, very few loose ends are left at novel's end, which is what I prefer when I read a stand-alone book. I'm curious to find out if Miles really did ever inherit the Empire Grill, but in the end it doesn't really matter. I also wish I knew if Tick ever had contact again with her summer love interest since her scheduled rendezvous obviously couldn't be kept. We do find out who was responsible for Cindy Whiting's accident as well as exactly what was wrong with John Voss and why he acted so strangely all the time. (His story is the most tragic, on several levels, and incredibly disturbing, so we had to know that his disappearance wouldn't last, leaving the reader unresolved over his fate; I knew there had to be a reason why I kept thinking of Pearl Jam's song \"Jeremy\" every time he was mentioned.) The book ends rather abruptly, though, and perhaps too happily (if that's the right word to use to describe the ending). I mean, for the sake of the book innocents had to be taken to show the randomness of some violence (amid the deliberate planning that was used), but it's almost too tidy that Tick gets out alive. The Catholic dependency also is dropped maybe too quickly, considering how tightly Miles holds on to that during the first three parts of the novel, but I suppose that's not necessarily all that important a thread to hold on to. Also, the shifting perspective throughout the novel is absolutely essential so that the reader can pick up (more quickly than Miles can, at least) what's going on with other characters' motivations (although probably the best character-building moment comes from Cindy Whiting in her last face-to-face interaction with Miles, which shows just how tightly readers hold on to Miles's perspective, which isn't necessarily always the right one), but near the end we're so far removed from Miles that getting back inside his head seems forced, as a way to simply bring the novel to its conclusion. Still, this is an amazing book overall simply because of the way it so accurately portrays the positives and negatives of small-town life. It doesn't have to be talking about a Maine city specifically to ring true to those who've experienced such an environment where everyone knows everyone else as a rule because that's just how it is. It picks up intensity as the end looms near (and one can't help but wonder exactly where the book is going or how it's ever going to make it there) and becomes less and less easy to put down. ...more A small town in Maine. I could almost describe it from memory of my early years as a seasonal visitor there. The characters are so real, and we have a \"silver fox\" in our community, too. Teachers have to love the description of the art teacher's scene. The novel is wry and poignant, one of the best. \"Diverting one's attention from the past was not the same as envisioning and embarking upon a future.\" (p. 19) While this seems to be the theme of Empire Falls by Richard Russo, my biggest problem with this novel is that there doesn't seem to be any move toward the future in this novel. Everyone in the book seems to be so entangled in the misdeeds of their parents and grandparents, as well as their own, that they can't cut free and live that future. Even when the hopes and dreams of the parents a \"Diverting one's attention from the past was not the same as envisioning and embarking upon a future.\" (p. 19) While this seems to be the theme of Empire Falls by Richard Russo, my biggest problem with this novel is that there doesn't seem to be any move toward the future in this novel. Everyone in the book seems to be so entangled in the misdeeds of their parents and grandparents, as well as their own, that they can't cut free and live that future. Even when the hopes and dreams of the parents are that the characters get loose for that future, the offspring seem doomed to betray that hope. Even when the offspring do take a few steps forward, the snare of their background pulls them back into a cesspool of despair that would make Camus or Kierkegaard seem like optimists. At the conclusion of this book, I was as depressed as I was at any time since my first viewing of The Last Picture Show . As a minister, I found this novel to be the best presentation of the biblical idea that \"the wage of sin is death\" since that classic Bogdonavich film. To be sure, there were touching moments that were artistically expressed enough to bring tears to my eyes and there were occasional flashes of insights that made it worth reading. Two such insights will be in upcoming sermons. Here are the ones I most enjoyed: \"'When I was a little boy,' Father Mark said, 'I used to think God actually lived up there.' 'In the steeple?' Miles said. Father Mark nodded. 'I thought when we sang hymns we were calling to Him to come down and be among us. Which, of course we were. But the literal proximity was reassuring.'\" But it goes on. \"'God Himself, a couple stories up...so close.' 'I was just thinking how far away it is,' Miles admitted.\" It goes on to suggest that Miles was more worried about falling, but then he goes on to think about the conversation. \"Interesting, Miles thought. Like himself, Father Mark, as a child, had been reassured by the imagined proximity of God, whereas adults, perhaps because they so often were up to no good, took more comfort from His remoteness.\" (pp. 44-45) Later, on pages 198-199, the same priest admits that he once thought of God as being like his maternal grandmother. It seems the old lady gave gifts of cash to her grandchildren for Christmas. She claimed to be able to see into their hearts and to give them money based on how much they loved her. Of course, the thing is that she merely placed the cash for the grandchildren based on her relationship to their parents. It wasn't an opportunity to give based on love, but a vindictive opportunity to get at her children through her grandchildren. The implication is that God is precisely the opposite of the vindictive grandmother. He really does give because He loves us and, even though He can see into the heart, He gives on the basis of His love, not ours. Of course, there is also some bad theology in the book. On page 261, a prayer is said to be answered on the basis \"God will sometimes respond to a request that's carelessly phrased.\" I think Russo has confused \"magic\" and \"prayer.\" The devil looks for a carelessly phrased request in order to torture the petitioner, but God responds according to His wisdom, not ours. As you can see, Empire Falls was stimulating to me, but not satisfying, colorful but not constructed well enough to be considered a solid work. ...more Empire Falls is a beautifully crafted, inventive and substantive character-driven novel. Having lived in college for four years in a milltown in Central Maine, in places, the novel seemed almost more realistic than the actuality of dwelling in the fabric of the milltown.

Having lived in college for four years in a milltown in Central Maine, in places, the novel seemed almost more realistic than the actuality of dwelling in the fabric of the milltown. That's possible only because Richard Russo has a talent for making both his vividly sketched blue-collar and blue-blooded characters really come alive. The credible story line is unafraid to assume some creative risks and the result is breath-taking imagery that lingers. Russo really succeeds in building a small town of his unique characters and tells the story so that we see them realistically through the eyes of the fellow citizens of Empire Falls. The storyline holds more than its fair share of surprises with a truly inventive twist at the close of the novel. The author's sanguine sense of humor carries one along as the plot gathers steam and the different threads become entangled in realistic and usually satisfying resolutions. Russo may owe homage to Elizabeth Strout for his portrait of ordinary life in a Maine milltown. The river itself ultimately proves itself a formidable player in the cast of Empire Falls. Russo seems to sum-up the lives of his characters this way: \"Lives are rivers. We imagine we can direct their paths, though in the end there's but one destination, and we end up being true to ourselves only because we have no choice.\" Empire Falls offers living proof that character is destiny. Perhaps, that's one of many reasons why this novel is so \"wicked good\" that it justly earned a Pulitzer Prize. ...more Keep in mind that it's been a while since I read this, but...

But how the hell did he get past the machine guns?! A Pulitzer novel should at the very least give us the machine guns. It seemed like the only forward momentum in this book was the page numbers. ...more Extremely well written with wonderful characters that I genuinely cared about. I found the middle of the book dragged a little, and the ending was tied up a little too neatly, but otherwise an exceptional read. This author knows how to create people and places that stay with you after the ending. I'm looking forward to reading more of his books<---C>Richard Russo</---C>", "Title": "Empire Falls"},
