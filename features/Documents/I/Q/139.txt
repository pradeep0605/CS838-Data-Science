Patricia Briggs is one of my go to authors when it comes to these types of books. After listening to the first book in this series ( Cry Wolf ), I decided to do book 2 in audio as well. I\u2019m happy I did. It was fast listening and the narrator did a great job voicing Anna and Charles. <+++>Hunting Ground</+++> takes place in Seattle. If you\u2019ve read the Mercy Thompson series, you remember that book where the were\u2019s are considering \u2018coming out\u2019 to the world- well, the time line is lined up with this book. Charles is there in the place of his father, the Marrok. And of course,<---M> he brings his mate and Omega</---M>, Anna. Anna is very useful in situations like this and she proves that time and time again. There is a lot going on with the story. Quite a few new characters, and some of the regulars. I like that, but at times it can feel a little overwhelming. I didn\u2019t love that. And the fact that I listened may have made it a little more difficult to keep track of everything. I liked some of the new characters, but I did miss Asil from book one. I\u2019m really hoping he\u2019s in the next book. There was some action and even some mystery, but what I loved most about this story was seeing the growth in Anna and Charles relationship. He\u2019s learning the can\u2019s and can\u2019ts when it comes to his damaged wolf. Anna is able to open up more to Charles and trust him more. Not just her wolf doing this, but her as a person. It\u2019s taken a lot of time for her to start to overcome her past and I love that she\u2019s doing it and moving forward. I\u2019m really enjoying this series. I can\u2019t tell if I like it as much as the Mercy Thompson books- I really love those. With each and every book I\u2019m liking it more and more. My husband tells me the next book is the best so far in the series so I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be listening to it sooner rather than later! ...more \u2620 Boring Outdated UF is Boring and Outdated Buddy Read (BOUFiBaOBR\u2122) with Ashley and Angela \u2620 Actual rating : 2.2 stars .

Damn, I can be so generous sometimes, it's making me all teary-eyed and stuff. This is such a delightful little series . I loved book 1 so much that I just could NOT wait to read this instalment. And if someone tells you that this is total BS, that I hated book 1 and swore a blood oath to stay the fish away from this series for the rest of the entirety of my entire life, well that someone is completely full of crappity crap . The truthful truth is, I thought book 1 was nothing short of amazing, and was more looking forward to reading Hunting Ground than to having the Scourge of Mexico go all TACTILE on me. That should tell you something right there. And to be completely clear: no, the Corruptor of Young Na\u00efve Innocent Souls (CoYNIS\u2122) named Angela did NOT put a gun to my lovely little head to force me to read this book. Absolutely not. I did it of my own free (view spoiler) [if slightly masochistic (hide spoiler) ] will . Do you seriously think a nefarious breeder of murderous crustaceans such as I would let herself be disgustingly manipulated in such a despicable manner? Please don't be ridiculous, my Little Barnacles. Soooooo , after splendidly enrapturing me with Cry Wolf, Patricia Briggs positively enchanted me with this little book here. So much captivating stuff to be had in this instalment, I don't really know where to start. Will you give me a minute to think about it? So lovely of you , my Tiny Arthropods. Here, put some headphones on and listen to some soothing elevator music while I try and figure out how to do this. What? You've never seen snailphones before? They're all the rage in my subaquatic kingdom! You really should go out more often, my Lovely Decapods. Okay , I'm ready to do the slightly vindictive thing now! Yay! You're welcome! \u2460 This book is a teensy little bit boring, flat, uninteresting and dull . But hey, it's not ALL bad, the book is lacklustre, too. It kind of makes Nightlife feel extremely exciting, actually. Which is quite an achievement , when you think about it, and means Hunting Ground here qualifies as a Superiorly Efficient Cure for Insomnia (SECfI\u2122). See? Told you it was not ALL bad! There are some fantastic, positive side effects to reading this book! And you know what else? This is such an emotional flatland that the story comes with a No Heart Attack Low Blood Pressure Guarantee (NHLBPG\u2122). Yep, that's just how exhilaratingly stimulating Hunting Ground is. Add to that the fascinatingly fascinating relationship crap that graces every single shrimping page of this wondrous little story, and you get one of the most spellbinding experiences ever. This really is Gloriously Glorious Decaf Diet Non-Fat UF (GGDDNFUF\u2122) at its best! \u2461 This book is kinda sorta outdated . I do love vintage UF. Because it never makes you feel like you've read the story hundreds of times . Oh no, absolutely not. Good old tales about werewolf/vamp/silly fae/whatever wars are always sooooo refreshing . And quite original, too. And decidedly creative. What? You think I'm being a bit too harsh here? Because the book was written just 8 years ago? You couldn't be more wrong. Because 1/ I'm not like that, oh no, not me. I am kindness and understanding personified. Obviously. And because 2/ 2009 in UF Wonderland equates to anciently ancient prehistory in Not-UF Wonderland. So there. Besides, I never said that this story being slightly outdated was a bad thing. Nope nope nope. To be honest, I think this beautifully antiquated touch gives the book a certain, irresistible je ne sais quoi. Which is pretty scrumptious , if you ask me. And partly explains why I loved the book so shrimping much . \u2462 Our lovely female MC, Anna, is, you know, lovely and stuff . Some weird, twisted people like their heroines to be ruthless, cunning, devious , possibly backstabbish , slightly cutthroatish bitches chicks who slice slice slice cut cut cut their way through life. EW EW EW. Some people are seriously disturbed , if you ask me. I personally love my heroines to be understanding, compassionate, peace-loving, soft-hearted, calming creatures whose mission in life is to soothe and appease and tranquillize and stuff. Which is why I love Anna Dear soooooo much. I mean, not only does the girl sing Brahms lullabies, she also destresses the restless masses by playing happy tunes from Sesame Street on battered old pianos (don't ask). She very graciously plays along with darling grandpapas who sing Mr Bojangles in restaurants, too! How delightfully delightful and overwhelmingly charming ! My Anna here is probably one of the mostest perfectest heroines ever: naturally talented, and a breathing, walking Xanax pill. A dream come true. I think I'm in love . You know , I have done a lot of thinking about the average rating for this book. I mean, 4.26 stars? Seriously? I knew you Little Barnacles had despicable book taste and stuff, but this is taking it a bit too far. So I have come to the following indisputable conclusion: either you raving lunatics read it wrong (view spoiler) [ so what else is new? (hide spoiler) ] , I read it wrong (view spoiler) [ hahaha, you can be so funny sometimes (hide spoiler) ] or I got my hunting grounds all mixed up and read this instead of Briggs' most glorious piece of UF lethargy excitement. Yeah, that must be it . \u00bb And the moral of this Bloody Shrimping Hell this Really is the Last Time I Read a Bloody Shrimping Book in this Bloody Shrimping Series Crappy Non Review (BSHtRitLTIRaBSBitBSSCNR\u2122) is: Angela, you made me read this thing. I love you. You are SO dead . \u2709 Very private, confidential message to Patricia Briggs and her wondrously bilingual editorial team: next time you want to use \"de nada\" in a sentence, do your little selves a huge favor and ask a 5-year-old kid for help. I'm pretty sure that he/she will do a better job of it than you did in this book. You're welcome. \u270e Book 0.5 : Alpha & Omega \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \u270e Book 1 : Cry Wolf \u2605\u2605 [Pre-review nonsense] The good news is , I did not hate it.

And until she was mated to Charles Cornick, the son- and enforcer- of Bran, the leader of the North American werewolves, she didn\u2019t know how dangerous it could be either. First I'd like to comment that the description on Goodreads is not a good description of the contents of the book (you'll see what I mean after you've read it) and does not match the description on the book jacket, which is a much better summary: \u201cAnna Latham didn\u2019t know how complicated life could be until she became a werewolf. And until she was mated to Charles Cornick, the son- and enforcer- of Bran, the leader of the North American werewolves, she didn\u2019t know how dangerous it could be either. Anna and Charles have just been enlisted to attend a summit to present Bran\u2019s controversial proposition: that the wolves should finally reveal themselves to humans. But the most feared Alpha in Europe is dead set against the plan- and it seems like someone else might be too. When Anna is attacked by vampires using pack magic, the kind of power only werewolves should be able to draw on, Charles and Anna must combine their talents to hunt down whoever is behind it all- or risk losing everything. \u201c I read Cry Wolf (the first book in the Alpha & Omega series) a couple of days ago and rated it three stars (which still seems a bit too harsh but 3,5 isn\u2019t available; I need to start a petition or something). Cry Wolf was a decent read. Plotwise I wasn\u2019t so in love with the action because it was too simple and too much based on a string of coincidences. But what I loved about the book was the romance, which pretty much centered around Anna and Charles getting to know each other and learning to trust each other, after their wolves had decided to mate. In Hunting Ground we\u2019re a month later in time. Charles and Anna are now married as also their human sides have accepted to be mated. Their mating bond though, still has to be developed and this depends on both Anna\u2019s ability to fully trust Charles as well as Charles\u2019 ability to open himself up to her. The deepening of their relationship is an ongoing process in the book and is beautifully worked out. Like last time, we get to be in both Anna\u2019s and Charles\u2019 heads and experience their doubts, fears and deep need for one another. I love Anna and Charles together and I especially like reading Charles\u2019 point of view about it. Being his father\u2019s assassin has made Charles block out deep feelings and emotions and he\u2019s often overwhelmed by Anna. She in her turn doesn\u2019t always know how to deal with Charles, who she (rightfully I think) calls a force of nature. Their ability to see one another for what they truly are, is the strength in their relationship. The way Briggs describes the mating bond -the intimacy of knowing and feeling what your mate is going through- is so great it almost makes you sad that us humans aren\u2019t capable of such a thing on such a level. Which is a great accomplishment by Briggs considering the fact that she absolutely does not glorify the supernatural creatures she writes about. Quite the opposite: I sure wouldn\u2019t want to be a werewolf. (Well... maybe if they add a Charles to the package I\u2019d consider\u2026) Unlike Cry Wolf, I wasn\u2019t put off by the action plot this time. There were a few minor things though I wasn\u2019t too happy with. First: Charles is supposed to be his father\u2019s enforcer for over a 150 years and is supposedly \u2018very very good at his job\u2019 as it keeps getting mentioned. But suddenly it seems like Anna is the key figure in everything he does, and it makes you wonder how he was able to pull off the job all by himself so very smoothly the 149 years before. Second: the villain to me was clear from the beginning. This is the third book of Briggs that I\u2019ve read so far and till now she keeps using the same ways to introduce certain characters. It's soon clear which characters are \u2018bad\u2019 and which are there to distract the attention. Still, the plot was very entertaining and nicely worked out. So again, a very decent read by Patricia Briggs. Will round it up to a full 4 stars this time. I\u2019m anxiously awaiting the third novel. ...more 3 Omega stars \u201cShe was his and he hers.\u201d \u201cWomen are the bloodthirsty sex.

While they are there, hired vampire assassins begin attacking the Omega's, human and wolf. This one took me a while to get through. I'm normally a huge Patricia Briggs fan, but for some reason this series isn't hitting it for me like the Mercy Thompson series did. What I loved: -Anna and Charles: I think the development of the relationship between these two characters is the only reason I will continue to read this series. Together and separately, Anna and Charles are some of the more interesting and unique characters I've read in a long time. But Briggs has a way of doing that. \u201cI would slay dragons for you. I suspect that finding an unoccupied bedroom will be easier.\u201d -The world-building: I am constantly wowed at the incredible job this author has done in creating this unique urban fantasy setting. Very few authors have done this for me. I want to go and visit! (Hopefully without becoming prey). -The setting: It was Washington State, enough said. That place is awesome! What didn't work: -The pacing: OMG the pacing was so off with this book! It would go really slow, and then really fast, but then mostly slow and I had a hard time getting through this book. -The constant reminders of pack hierarchy: We get it already, when dominant werewolves are around each other shit is about to go down. Stop using 50 pages to reiterate something that happened, but you can't tell at once because all of the wolves have to pull their dicks out and measure them. UGH. So overall, I liked this book, but I didn't love it. \u201cTo make great art, you had to expose your soul, and some things should be left safely in the dark.\u201d Lastly (and Gilmore Girls fans will understand) when they introduced a foreign wolf called Michel Girard, I immediately saw this: ...more Hunting Ground continues with Charles and Anna, newly mated and working on their relationship.

I like how simple Briggs writes. Not a lot of nonsense, extraneous prose that bogs down the story. Despite her concise narrative, she conveys so much, filling the novel with an emotional power. Her characters have a distinct feel to them from other writers. I like that she puts their flaws out there unashamedly, and it makes you love the characters even more.

Her characters have a distinct feel to them from other writers. I like that she puts their flaws out there unashamedly, and it makes you love the characters even more. I will freely admit I like the scary hero that everyone fears, but the one woman who looked into his heart and feels safe with him, and is not afraid to love him. I think that Anna and Charles have that sort of bond that is symbiotic. It doesn't really apply to call it yin and yang, but there are elements of softness and strength coming together. Truly though, their strengths complement each other. And they aren't trying to modify each other to make a more comfortable fit for the other. It's more a matter of growing in their knowledge of each other, and growing together. I find their relationship very fascinating and fulfilling, and that's another reason why I read this book slowly. The storyline was very good as well. A lot of intrigue here, to see who was trying to destroy the Marrok's plan for an alliance when the werewolves reveal themselves to the world. The suspense was done cleverly, because you look at the key players, think someone looks likely, but look away to focus on someone else, and then you realize that things aren't the way they seem. I liked how she kept me guessing. The werewolf parts are fantastic as usual. Just utterly fascinating. Another thing to appreciate from all angles as I read. And throw some faerie and King Arthur stuff in there, and I start thinking this story is tailor made for me. This is my kind of urban fantasy. Naturalistic characters with identifiable motivations, enough grit to keep my heart beating fast, a heroine whose strength comes from within, and who grows right in front of my eyes, for Anna is a phoenix who rose from the ashes. A to-die-for hero who makes me sigh even as he makes others shudder with fear. But then you see his soft spot is his Anna. How can I resist that? Just the right dose of romance that fits into the story so well, it neither distracts or detracts from the fantasy elements. Everything my heart desires, except the book was over, and I still wanted more. I love you, Patricia Briggs. ...more 4.5 Stars I'm loving Charles and Anna a little more with each book.

No author does light/dark quite like Patricia Briggs, and this audiobook really emblazoned that fact by putting these preternaturals\u2019 best and worst qualities on display. Holter Graham\u2019s narration continues to leave me in thrall, and the murder mystery plot line made hours of listening time feel like mere minutes. Now I understand why this series trumps MERCY THOMPSON for many. I enjoyed being a fly on the wall at the werewolf conference; pack dynamics have always fascinated me, and the political aspects that Briggs brought to the fore were so well executed that it was impossible not to get caught-up in the discussions. This novel really showcased the best and worst of shifter society from The Beast who likes to feast on human flesh, to Arthur who obviously wasn\u2019t playing with a full deck of cards, to Anna who\u2019s slowly coming back from the dead. I hadn\u2019t expected to meet another Omega already what with them being extremely rare and all, but it seems like Ric was as clueless about his nature as Latham, so it was amusing watching them attempt to fill-in the blanks together. In spite of all of the mad goings-on in this tale, Anna & Charles still remain the driving force behind this series. I love how flawed their characters are, and how they continually adapt to each other in an effort to strengthen their mate bond. The open communication that exists between them is a breath of fresh air when compared to other couples in this genre where relationship drama has become the norm. I liked how the author added a historical element to HUNTING GROUND by putting her own werewolf spin on King Arthur, although I do wish that Latham hadn\u2019t been coveted by yet another certifiable shifter so soon after leaving her first pack. Her kill count is staggeringly high after only two installments. Holter Graham\u2019s narration made an impression on me in CRY WOLF, and in this audio he went above and beyond his original performance. He demonstrated great flexibility and flair by bringing the foreign wolves to life with various accents while still staying true to the original voices of Anna & Charles, although the latter was admittedly somewhat modified. His delivery was both emotionally poignant and intense which were contributing factors to this story\u2019s believably and further increased the purity of the characters. Graham\u2019s inflections made the changes in POVs obvious, and I can\u2019t wait to see what he does with FAIR GAME. HUNTING GROUND should be on every audiobook listener\u2019s playlist. ...more [4.5 Stars] Really loved this one.

The first story was \"Alpha and Omega\" in the On the Prowl anthology and the second was a stand alone book, Cry Wolf. The series follows Anna and Charles after they meet in the first book and find out they are mates, then they must work their way through learning to accept the mating bond and work out their life together. Anna was abused by her first pack which features heavily in the story as she tries to overcome her emotional scars. She is an Omega wolf, which means that she makes the pack feel happy and is outside the typical pack structure. She struggles with figuring out exactly where she stands in the pack because she was told she was the most submissive in the pack by her abusive former pack, which is not true at all but she needs to refind her strength. Charles is the son of Bran, The Marrok aka leader of all the wolves. By necessity, Charles has become his father's killer for wolves who break pack law. Charles keeps himself separate from all the wolves because he knows it will be easier to execute casual acquaintances than close friends. He doesn't quite know what to do with Anna because he loves her but has trouble opening himself up totally to the mating bond because he is afraid Anna will see him as a killer and not be able to love him. Charles knows that Anna is still afraid of him sometimes, especially in bed because of the abuse she suffered. He does everything he can to help her heal, he even allows her more freedom when she needs it because he knows she needs to stand on her own despite his wolf's need to keep her as safe as possible. They both love each other and are slowly opening up enough to show it. In this story, Charles and Anna travel to Seattle to meet with wolves from all over the world to discuss terms for the unveiling of wolves to the human population. Bran was supposed to go but Charles argued with him until he let Charles go in his place. Charles's grandfather was a Native American shaman and his father is witch-born, so he sees things that most people don't and the spirits told him that his father could die if he went to Seattle. So Charles and Anna go in his place to relay The Marrok's terms to the wolf alphas. Once in Seattle, Charles and Anna meet up with the local wolf pack and Dana, a Fae who is helping keep the peace with the wolves for a price. Soon after the negotiations begin, Anna is attacked and almost kidnapped by vampires. Before they have a chance to investigate, murders start to occur and more attacks come. Charles and Anna need to determine who is behind the attacks before they end up dead or the talks are ruined. I really enjoyed this book, Anna and Charles are great main characters who grow and learn more about each other with each book. I love seeing Anna regain her strength and courage. Charles is a great hero who has a lot of compassion and love for Anna but sees himself as a cold-blooded killer. Poor guy! The mystery in Patricia Briggs books is always very interesting. Her mythology of wolves who are very complex, vampires who are pretty vicious and the Fae who can be downright scary make up a very interesting world. I am really enjoying this story and learning more about Bran and Charles who we originally meet in the Mercy Thompson series. I think Patricia Briggs is a very talented author, I recommend checking out this series and the Mercy Thompson series which I love because the heroine is wonderful. I think the Alpha and Omega series is a very good werewolf series that has a romance and mystery. ...more Two words - Charles Cornick.

There was a huge cast of characters in this book and it was interesting to learn about the wolf packs from different countries. It was a real eye opener to see just how powerful Bran was without him actually being in the story. The interactions between pack Alphas was intriguing, if not on the precipice of violence. I loved how they all seemed to walk on eggshells. I was amused at how a simple Omega wolf could cause a bunch of Alphas to want to rush and rescue her and how she could easily calm them down. This is the book where Anna shines as a character. Still skittish, Anna relies on her wolf nature in order to adjust to situations. Anna is learning how to be an Omega wolf and what it entails. The wolves are also learning the power of an Omega. I loved watching Anna transform from a \u201cscared rabbit\u201d to an assertive, protective wolf. I loved the stolen moments that Anna and Charles shared. Theirs is a strange and unusual relationship: their wolves chose each other as mates. I found it fascinating that Anna allowed her wolf nature to take over during their moments together. It was as if her wolf was protecting her from her past, painful memories. It was also nice to see the tender side of Charles. He was so sweet and patient with Anna. The author has a talent of creating an urban fantasy world that feels so believable.

She\u2019s grown in a gradual way that makes her success at getting over her past a personal accomplishment and one that opens opportunities for her to love someone....someone like Charles. What I love about this series is the romance. It\u2019s not perfect where Anna and Charles find each other and fall desperately in love with each other and they love happily ever after. THE END. No, not here. Both of them are unsure and probably a little scared and that makes the romance between these two all the more interesting. A light touch in human form or a slight nudge in wolf form makes the relationship fascinating because they are learning each other slowly. It\u2019s just great to read. And then there\u2019s all the wolf politics! Wow, I wasn\u2019t expecting half of the twists that Briggs pulled in this one! I was completely taken aback and it was definitely one I\u2019d like to pick up again soon.

I think I'm just going to love everything that Patricia Briggs writes because she certainly hasn't steered me wrong so far! The world building in these two series is phenomenal, you have the werewolves with their dominance issues, the fae who are very good at keeping secrets plus of course the vampires have their own agendas and I can't get enough of it all. The Alpha and Omega series gives us a change to discover much more about Pack politics and to see how issues are resolved in the world of the werewolves. Bran has decided that it is time for the werewolves to make their presence known to the general public, he knows that they aren't going to be able to remain hidden for much longer with all this modern technology and he knows it is better to come out on their own terms before they are discovered. As the Alpha who has control of the whole of America Bran doesn't need to ask anyone's permission to carry out his plans but he has agreed to speak to the European werewolves and answer any questions they may have. Charles is the one who gets to be in charge at the conference of Alpha's who have gathered from all over Europe to discuss the issue. It's never easy to have so many Alpha wolves in one place where they're all fighting to prove their dominance but things get even more complicated when some of their visitors come under attack from an unknown enemy. It is up to Charles and Anna to get to the bottom of what is happening before one of them pays the ultimate price. The best thing about the Alpha & Omega books is the relationship development between Anna and Charles. When we met Anna she had been abused and beaten down for years so it is taking time for her to build her confidence. Deep down she knows that Charles would never hurt her but she still scares easily, especially when they are surrounded by Alpha wolves. I have loved seeing them work through things together, neither of them is experienced when it comes to relationships so even though Charles is so much older than Anna is these feelings are new to him too and it is so sweet watching him try to figure things out. What I love most about Charles is the way he protects Anna without being overprotective, he actually encourages her to stand on her own two feet and is there to provide extra support when she needs it. My favourite Charles quote shows exactly what I mean: \"If it would benefit you, I would kill every wolf here. But there are things that you need to do - and interfering with that is not protecting, not in my book, the best way for me to protect you is to encourage you to be able to protect yourself.\" Both Anna and Charles are completely out of their comfort zone here which helps them bond with each other on a deeper level than before and grow as a couple. We get to see Anna learn more about her role as Omega and how she fits into the Pack hierarchy. \u201cAn Omega wolf is an Alpha wolf who is extremely zen.\u201d That has to be the best description I've ever seen of an Omega and it explains Anna's role perfectly, she has all the protective instincts of an Alpha but is missing the violent tendencies they usually display. That doesn't mean she won't fight to protect her Pack but it does mean violence isn't going to be the first thing she resorts to. The romance may be an important part of this series but Hunting Ground is also an action packed story that has so much going on it will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. I did manage to figure out who was behind the attacks eventually but not until very near the end of the book and only just before Anna and Charles did. I just couldn't read this book fast enough and it's left me desperate to carry on with the series! ________________________________ 2nd Read Buddy read with Ange Since it's been nearly 2 years since Ange & I buddy read this series last we decided we're well overdue another read in the run up to the release of Fire Touched next March. I love this series so much! The characters, the world building just everything about these books makes them a comfort read for me. Along with Ilona Andrews's Kate Daniels series this is probably my most reread series & I never get tired of it. ________________________________ 3rd Read I'm running out of words of praise for this series. The fact that I'm on my 4th reread of most of the books in this series should give you an idea how much I love it though. Anna and Charles <3<3<3 ...more Of the first three stories (Alpha & Omega, Cry Wolf, and Hunting Ground) this is definitely the most romantic. The pacing of the story is tight and moves along quickly, and we really get a chance to delve into the politics of the werewolves - around the world.

At the same time we get to know Charles and Anna even better, and watch their relationship grow, which is my favorite part. Anna still has some issues with the abuse she suffered at the hands of her old pack. I love how Patricia Briggs handles this, it's not a constant fear, but it comes through at random moments and overwhelms her. She struggles against it, and talks herself past it frequently, but that's not always possible. It's shown beautifully at the beginning, Charles is drawing deeper and deeper into himself and his frustrations, and Anna has plans to bring him out of it by ambush. There's still that ingrained moment of hesitation about making him mad, what a much larger, more dominant wolf could do to her. Logically she knows he would never hurt her, and she knows that in her heart too, but it's hard to overcome what years of abuse will drill into a person. Even worried about that, Anna does it anyway - because she loves Charles. Seeing their relationship grow, and deepen, is a true joy. The comfort, and easiness between them continues to grow. That she can tease him, tickle him, and have fun with him shows just how far Anna's come. That Charles plays with her, shares private jokes, and can generally be a \"lovebird\" is perfect. I also really love how they're both adjusting to each other. They talk about it at one point and Anna asks if Charles is as confused as she is, and he says that he's not, but that he's differently confused because he'd had so long to settle into himself and being alone that the transition is different for him. Charles isn't a big talker, doesn't always trust his words to be what he wants them to be, but I love that he makes a real effort for Anna when she needs it. The mystery part of it is interesting, though I don't think it's hard to figure out who the ultimate \"bad-guy\" is - I can't recall if I did my first time reading it. I think I'll just add some favorite quotes here, nothing too spoilery, but be warned if you don't like to read anything like that :) She gave him a happy look as he followed her out on the water-soaked wooden walk. \"This could be fun,\" she said, then turned, took a running step, and did a couple of back flips - like a middle-school kid at recess. He stopped where he was, lust and love and fear rising up in a surge of emotion he did not, for all his years, have any idea how to deal with. \"What?\" she asked, a little breathless from her gymnastics. She brushed her wavy heair out of her face and gave him a serious look. \"Is there something wrong?\" He could hardly tell her that he was afraid because he didn't know what he'd do if something happened to her. That his sudden, unexpected reaction had brought Brother Wolf to the fore. She threw his balance off; his control - which had become almost effortless over the years - was erratic at best. *** \"You are a remarkable man, Charles Cornick.\" He wrapped his arms around her shoulders and put his chin on the top of her head. \"I know,\" he confided lightly. \"And often under-appreciated by those who don't know any better.\" She poked him with a finger and looked up at him. \"And funny - though I expect that is another facet of your character that goes unappreciated even more often than your remarkableness.\" \"Some people don't even notice,\" he said in a mock-mournful voice. *** \"Do you remember when I told you that you were my mate - and you responded by telling me you didn't like sex?\" She giggled at his smug tone. \"I thought it only fair to warn you.\" *** She was on the far side, leaving two cold feet of mattress between them. He knew that she'd fall asleep like that...and then gradually move over until she was plastered against him. Then he could go to sleep, too. *** \"...I love your touch. Touch me anytime. Any place. Anywhere.\" It was heartfelt, and honest... <<*snip*>> \"Pet me,\" he told her. \"I like it.\" ...more Patricia Briggs has once again ensnared me, I LOVED this book! Huntung Ground is set just before the werewolves come out to the public and Charles and Anna go to a meeting with all the European werewolves to soothe some fears...not that it works out that way of course.

It also shows Charles and Anna's developing relationship. Part of Patricia Briggs has once again ensnared me, I LOVED this book!

I like that she is still wary as it seems more realistic but it also gives you an idea of how tough she is. As for Charles *dreamy sigh* I am sooo in love with Charles it is always the silent and deadly ones that get to me!

I appreciate all the time we spend with both of them as they become even closer. And seeing Anna grow and become even more comfortable in her skin is incredibly satisfying. The plot moves quickly, and is just the right amount of intricate. I liked all the further information we get as a result of what Charles and Anna are up to, and involved in. It's also unexpectedly funny. Much like Charles. I love how no one expects him to have a sense of humor, and he works to keep it that way, but he's constantly kidding and joking with and for Anna.

I determined the villain eventually, but it was not obvious. Maybe a slow start, but action kicks in soon enough and doesn't let up. I was on the edge of my seat. Omega Kicks Ass: In this book, Briggs further develops Anna's character. The formerly abused omega werewolf has guts as well as wisdom. She's attacked or kidnapped numerous times, but she's always thinking through the various possible scenarios and sleuthing out the villains. I sympathized with protective Charles, especially when he (his brother wolf) was sooo upset after (view spoiler) [ Anna, Moira, and Tom were attacked by vamps on the street, and also when he went after the Beast who threatened Anna, at the pack hunt party. The scene immediately after the pack hunt, at the beach, was sweet, a little poignant, and showed Anna's wisdom. Also enjoyed the scene when Charles went after vampires. LOL. He is ferocious for his Anna!! (hide spoiler) ] But despite all Charles's heroic derring do, in the end, Anna kicks asparagus, too. She's come a long way from the role forced on her in the prequel, Alpha & Omega: A Companion Novella to Cry Wolf . Note: We learn a little more about their mating bond gifts. Before the Hunt begins ( 62%) Anna shifts faster than the others, and much faster than she could before mating with Charles. It's a gift from Brother Wolf (Charles was born a pup and so he alone can shift instantly.) Minor Gripes: Some redundancy get a bit boring. I am not crazy about how Briggs shows the same scene from multiple POVs, as with the first attack on Anna. We \"saw\" this attack in present time, when it happened, mainly through Anna's POV. Then, we \"saw\" it again when Charles came along looking for clues. Then, AGAIN when Anna had to describe the attack to Angus and Charles.

I know I'm all gushy right now, so let me get to my review: The continuing story of Charles and Anna, newly mated werewolves tentatively learning to trust their feelings and the truemate bonding that holds them together. In Hunting Ground, Alpha of Alpha's Bran sends his son Charles and his new daughter-in-law to a convening of alphas- one which he was meant to go to himself. The gathering, meant to ease the pack leaders into the news that Bran will be formerly announcing their existence to the world turns into something more when someone attempts to use this time for their own means. The couple soon find themselves in the thick of it after a group of renegade Vampires attack Anna while Charles is tied up at the convention. Things are not what they seem though and Anna senses that the true person behind the attacks may be one of their very own. It will take overcoming fear- in Anna's case- and a combination of the two of them to suss out the true threat and overcome the ancient evil wanting desperately to bring down the Alpha and Omega. Brigg's can do no wrong with this series as far as I'm concerned. I was hooked from the novella that brought these two together ( On the Prowl (Alpha and Omega:Briggs) (Inhuman:Wilks) (Buying Trouble:Chance) ) and its only gotten better with the following books. Charles is alpha but stands alone as his uberalpha father's enforcer. Anna abused by the very people who were meant to protect her is leery of alphas- hence their struggle. Charles a killer by nature but soulful mystic at heart, Anna an emotional healer in badly need of a healing herself- thrown together because of a mating bond that wont let each other go- and these two don't need any outside influence to create conflict. Yet that's what makes this series work, because though they struggle they always come back to love and both have courage that not many people have- not to kill evil when faced with it- although there is that- no, the courage to stand naked and vulnerable in front of each other (and I'm speaking metaphorically of course) and have the other love them... just as they are. I love that. I love her exploration of \"pack dynamics\" as another reader put it, (something so psychological about it all which I cannot resist!). I love this series. Just know that Briggs is good at what she does and you should be reading this series too! :) Cant wait for more!

In this book, they go to a summit in Seattle in Bran's place (after much arguing on Charles's part), where they must deal with the concerns of the European werewolves concerning Bran's plan to make werewolves known to the world. And, let me tell you, it's quite the violent ride. There is much death and underhanded sneakiness in Hunting Ground , with a splash of romance to make things interesting. In this book, Anna finally starts to really work through her fears: she works on not being a ball of terror in the presence of dominants, especially Alphas, and she works on her intimacy issues, to the point that, by the end, she's completely comfortable sitting in Charles's lap and receiving a steamy kiss in front of a room filled with other werewolves. It was great to see Anna finally conquer these two huge fears. She's been working at it ever since the prequel novella, and she finally makes a lot of headway in Hunting Ground , finally embracing her strength. As a result, she is able to convince Charles that she loves him for him and will never leave him. No way, Jose! Charles makes some progress in this book, too. By the end, he doesn't doubt himself and Anna's love for him so much. He's confident that he is hers just as she is his. He's still wildly, sexily possessive, silent and strong, and subtly funny. He's still Charles Cornick, Executioner, but he doesn't see himself as only that anymore. Next to that picture he now sees Charles Cornick, Lover Of And Loved By Anna Cornick. And how cute is that?! I missed Bran in this book! He is in it briefly in the beginning and briefly at the end, but we don't really get much Bran Page Time. I hope that this changes in the next book. Also, it was nice to see Tom and Moira, the characters that the previous novella is about. When I read \"Seeing Eye,\" I wasn't exactly sure where they were going to fit into the series, but I loved seeing them reappear here. Now that I've blown through this series, I don't know what I'm going to do with myself waiting for Fair Game to come out next year ! Gah! Write faster, Patricia! P.S. I knew who was behind it all the whole time. I didn't want to be right, so I deluded myself into thinking I didn't know, but I did.
