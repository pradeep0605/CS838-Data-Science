Assholes who have the common traits of narcissism, marchiavellianism and pyscopathy according to recent studies, score more with the ladies. It's called the Dark Triad (I know - best name ever) and in many respects these aspects of a person can be considered partially genetic traits. So when ladies hook up with the dirtbags, they occassionally spawn a entirely new generation to fill up a gene pool that obviously NEEDS more jerks. I'm not going to bag out <+++>Magic Bites</+++> because I actually really, really enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series, which I'm about to start, but either Curran needs to have a major personality overhaul or he needs to be boinking someone else. He's aggressive, petty, arrogant, dismissive and violent. And yes, I caught myself thinking he was hot on a couple of occasions. I will submit myself for regular beatings - with nunchucks later. Nunchucks can cure anything. I really loved the concept, I loved the world and its interesting take on vampires and the governing associations that run the world. I had just a LITTLE bit of a problem with the characterization. Okay, I might get crucified for this, but Kate Daniels actually really reminded me of Anita Blake. Paranormal mystery solver? Check! Daggy clothes and utter disregard to style? Check! Tough-talking super bravado? Check! Solves everything with violence or an over abundance of natural magical ability? Check! Obviously when more than two men had an overly enthusiastic sexual interest in Kate, my Pavlovian conditioning kicked in and I was half prepared for Kate Daniels to turn into a slutqueen with a magical vagina. You have no idea how happy I was when she didn't! I did like her better than Anita though as she had moments of maturity when she decided that tough talk and threats of violence weren't really conducive to what she needed and thus backed down and recognized that she can't defeat evil with her badassery alone (Anita will never discover this because even if she died, she'd just seduce God and steal his powers and then we'd ALL be in a lot of trouble!) Also, when the chips were down, she got drunk, sat on her porch and DARED the world to come and get her. I like it. Best. Fucking. Plan. Ever. I felt true sisterly affection for her then! The mystery was painfully easy but I dismissed that because everything else was covered in so much badass awesomeness. Besides, right from the start, Kate laid out her very tactical sleuthing plan and I immediately knew that she was definitely NOT Poirot or Sherlock Holmes. She was SUPPOSED to be bad at it and thus she gets my seal of approval. It's truly aweinspiring when you can suck arse at something and still come out on top! I love it. So, over all, THOUGH I only gave it three stars, I actually liked it. Funny, fun, a little bit sexy and a good, light read. Except for all the gruesome death, rape, stabbing, decomposing and dying. ...more Don't be fooled by the awful cover, this is the best UF series out there.

I typically can't reread a series every year b/c I get bored, and I thought that might be a problem this time, but, NOPE, it's not. This is also the series I immediately suggest when asked for a reading recommendation, and it's hooked every person that's taken that advice. When I'm harassing people for feedback, they've all liked MAGIC BITES enough to read the next book, which is good b/c unlike most series, this one just keeps getting better. There have, however, been a few complaints that this first book is a little confusing on the world-building front . I can't be completely objective, b/c looking back after reading the series five(+) times . . . hindsight is, after all, 20/20. The basic premise is brand new: the world began with magic and technology existing in a harmonious balance. The analogy made is of a pendulum swinging only slightly back (magic) and forth (technology). But over time man developed magic, causing the pendulum to swing increasingly wildly until the pendulum crashed to the other side, leaving only a minimal amount of magic behind and flooding the world with the ability to use technology in magic's stead. I pictured it like that boat ride at theme parks--at Carowinds it's called the Frenzoid--that starts out swinging slowing back and forth, gaining momentum, until finally, after a nerve-wracking several seconds held completely upside down, it crashes to the other side. This happens approximately every 4000(ish) years, most recently about 40 years prior to the present time in the book. The changeover from magic-to-tech, or in the book's case, tech-to-magic, is not immediately complete. Like the Frenzoid, after the initial shift from back-and-forth to completing a full circle, the momentum keeps the boat (or magic/tech) swinging wildly back and forth until it settles down in the middle, or magic in MAGIC BITES. As man develops magic to replace the lost technology, the process begins again, and in another 4000ish years the reverse shift will occur. I honestly can't remember how well this is explained in book 1, but I do know that if it wasn't fully explained, I did not care. It was secondary to the plot and the characters. I knew that sometimes magic worked and sometimes it didn't. Same for technology. I knew that when magic worked, guns wouldn't fire, and that spells didn't work when tech was up. I also knew this was why Kate carried a sword--b/c a sword always works.<-----Kate is KICK-ASS. And that was enough information for me, b/c who cares about world-building when you have a main character like Kate Daniels? Not me. Kate is the perfect heroine. On the surface, she's the standard Urban Fantasy MC: she's super special magically and snarktastic. Oftentimes this can get old, but not Kate Daniels, who after numerous rereads only gets more fantastic. Unlike other UF heroines, Kate's brand of special kept her truly isolated. She didn't feel alone, she was alone. Anything else meant death. And yeah, her mouth is always getting her into trouble, but Kate often reveals her vulnerability right before she attacks: Curran turned to me. \"Take one of mine again and I'll kill you.\" He said it in a conversational manner, matter-of-fact and flat, but in his eyes I could see a simple certainty. If he had to, he would kill me. He would not lose any sleep over it. He would not give it a second thought. He would do it and move on, untroubled by ending my existence. It scared the shit out of me, so I laughed in his face . She was scared. So she laughed. In his FACE. And that , ladies and gentlemen, is why I love Kate. She doesn't bitch and moan about how life isn't fair, why her? She does what needs doing, and she often does it hilariously. She's my favorite. Teenage girls everywhere wish that they were Katniss Everdeen. I wish I was Kate Daniels.

Thoughts <+++>Magic Bites</+++> was the introduction to an action-packed , drama-free and gruesome saga. I must admit there were many times I felt confused and my brain hurt from the effort to understand, because the world-building was slow with many questions unanswered, and that's the reason I rated it with 4 stars. That being said, I immensely enjoyed this book ! Despite being difficult to get into, it kept me hooked and I was eager to learn more, to dive into magic adventures and bloody fights! I've read my fair share of urban fantasy but this series was different from my regular YA ones. More mature, darker, crueller and slightly disgusting (unless you are unfazed by mutilated corpses and a huge variety of body fluids), yet fascinating and extremely engaging . The characters \u201cWhat kind of a woman greets the Beast Lord with 'here, kitty, kitty'?\u201d That's Kate.

How about a shapechanger whose beast form is a lion, sexy as hell, arrogant and stubborn alpha-male asshole ? Meet Curran, also known as sex-on-a-stick . While romance isn't the main focus of Magic Bites, you can sense that things will get intimate between Kate and Curran because holy.hawt.chemistry.Batman! They barely tolerate each other because they're so much alike, and they constantly bicker and that's why when they finally get together I expect explosions and fireworks! If you're in the mood for a darker urban fantasy book full of blood and gore , then don't hesitate to grab the Kate Daniels series!

Hamilton, and was seduced into the dark, enchanting world of urban fantasy. She went on to read more urban fantasy than she could shake a stick at. Over the years, she lost touch with Anita Blake, and mourned the loss of a tough-as-nails, kickass, urban fantasy heroine to join for exciting, dangerous, and magical adventures. Recently, she finally picked up a book called Magic Bite About twelve years ago, there was a little girl named Danielle who read a book called Guilty Pleasures by Laurell K. Hamilton, and was seduced into the dark, enchanting world of urban fantasy. She went on to read more urban fantasy than she could shake a stick at. Over the years, she lost touch with Anita Blake, and mourned the loss of a tough-as-nails, kickass, urban fantasy heroine to join for exciting, dangerous, and magical adventures. Recently, she finally picked up a book called Magic Bites, which had been sitting on her bloated, embarrassingly large tbr pile. She read it to find out who this mysterious \"Beast Lord\" was, and why everyone thought that Kate and Curran were the best urban fantasy couple. That young girl is a very happy camper. Magic Bites is a hard book to describe. If you are a genuine, die-hard urban fantasy fan, you will like this book. At 260 pages, it appears deceptively slim. However, there's a lot of information, adventure, description, and incredibly good writing in that relatively small amount of pages. I will admit that this book made being confused and baffled fun for me. I had a lot of questions as I was reading. Still do. But that's kind of nice. Kate Daniels is one of the best urban fantasy heroines I've had the pleasure to meet. I've said before that I don't care for arrogant, braggadocious, posturing characters. She doesn't posture. She simply is a bad-ass, but down to earth, at the same time. She doesn't run around in bustiers, low-riding leather pants, and stiletto heels, climbing out of bed with some random guy long enough to kick-butt. She wears clothes that facilitate her ability to kick ass and to keep herself alive. Being cute is all good and well, but in her world, being cute might get her killed. Her only vanity is her long hair, which she keeps in a braid most of the time. Lethal abilities aside, Kate is very feminine. She can appreciate a cute guy, and she had flaws and weaknesses just like the rest of us armchair kickbutt heroines. I like her no-nonsense view of the world, her snarky sense of humor, and the fact that she likes to pull the lion by the tail, sometimes literally. I thought she was an interesting character. She has some emotional wounds that she is dealing with, and tends to keep her own company. It's nice to see a thoughtful, almost brooding heroine in this genre. Ms. Andrews earned my respect. The Atlanta that she has created is a very fascinating place. I still don't understand all of what occurred to make Atlanta very much like a dystopic wastleland, but I didn't have to understand that to enjoy this book. I do know that magic plays a huge hand in the catastrophe that hit this fair Southern city. It seems to surge and ebb, like the electricity brownouts that were hitting California when I lived out there. For all the importance that magic plays in this story, Ms. Andrews is never heavy-handed with the use of magic. In fact, she lightly and skillfully builds a storyline that is credible and interesting around the tendrils of magic power wielded in different ways by many of the characters in this novel. And better yet, she was able to create a female magic-wielder who wasn't a witch. I believe there are far too many witch urban fantasy and paranormal heroines. It's gotten to the point where it's almost cliche'. Her use of folklore is clever and well-placed. She takes a different direction with vampires, shapechangers, and mages. I must say I've never seen vampires described in the manner in which they exist in this story. They are quite gruesome and almost pitiful in Kate Daniels' world. I have to say that <---A>Ilona Andrews</---A> writing is high class. She sets the scenes very well, using language in just the right way, to keep the story flowing forward. She employs the noir elements that I enjoy in urban fantasy and occult detective novels very well. Better yet, she treats the reader with respect, understanding that popular fiction readers like to be challenged and fully engaged. She seems to understand that just because we enjoy fantastic, escapist material, it doesn't mean that we want to read something meaningless and without substance. In fact, I felt as though I was reading a police procedural with magical and horrific elements (a sure sign of a good occult detective novel). I thought I had figured out who the killer was fairly early on (and was about to be disappointed), but I was way off. When the reveal happens, it comes at you in such a manner that you cannot help but admire how skillfully the red herring and clues were laid out. As I read this book, my brain, which always tries to make order and sense of things, tried to think of a way to categorize and classify this book and the world within it. I never came up with a concrete classification. But that's a good thing. It's nice to find something new within a well-loved genre, and to encounter a novel reading experience at the same time. This book delivered that to me. If I were to make any literary allusions, I would consider this book to have incorporated the story traditions of the tales of medieval knights, with a modern and often horrific spin. If I could describe Kate in any quick way, I would call her a knight-mercenary. She has the requisite sword, although she lacks the steed that usually goes with the package(To my pleasant surprise, there is quite a bit of horse-riding in this book, but Kate doesn't have her own horse). Unfortunately, we didn't get to see her wearing her armor. Maybe in the next books. Slasher, her blood-thirsty and sentient sword, reminded me of Stormbringer, the vampiric sword owned by Elric of Melnibon\u00e9 , written by Michael Moorcock, whom I became acquainted with earlier this fall. Any urban fantasy heroine has to have a potential spark, if you will. That's where Curran, The Beast Lord, comes in. He's impressive, let's leave it at that. He's not just a potential love interest, but a powerful ally. These two butt heads in the most delightful ways. As the Beast Lord, and a lion shapeshifter, Curran's used to being in charge, and Kate lives by the 'you're not the boss of me' philosophy. I look forward to more fighting alongside, and flirting with Curran in the next books. This book is quite dark. Blood (and blood magic) and guts aplenty, dark deeds, dark magic, dark creatures. This is a book for a reasonably mature reader, in that regard. Being a big fan of Magic Noir (thank you, Brad, for letting me steal your fantastic term), I enjoyed those aspects. But I did wince at a few particularly gruesome scenes. The villain is a very disturbing individual, in more ways than one. Everything in this story has an edge to it. That's not a bad thing to this reader, since she enjoys a little darkness in her fiction. But if you tend to enjoy the lighter urban fantasy stories, you'd want to be prepared when you read this one. Now there is humor, but it's of the drier, more wry, and grimmer variety. If you like the hero to get banged up and injured quite a bit, you'll enjoy that about this novel. Kate definitely faces jeopardy, again and again. The stakes are particularly high in this novel, in ways that you need to read to find out. So, after so much rambling, I have to say that this urban fantasy fan has found a new series of which she intends to fully avail herself. Kate Daniels is my newest knight in shining armor. Let the adventures continue. ...more Curran, where have you been all my life? Because he simply stole my heart from the very beginning. And I\u2019m usually not even into shapeshifters!

And not a single moment of boredom, throughout the read, was present, especially when he was around. Kate Daniels may remind you of some other strong, kick-ass, sarcastic and brutal honest heroines in other UF series. EXCEPT, this girl is not TSTL or too focused on her work to look for romantic love and, also, doesn\u2019t jump on every guy she meets, like many other UF protagonists I have met. \u201cWhy a raven?\" \"To honor my father.\" \"The writing under it, is that Cyrillic?\" \"Yes.\" \"What does it say?\" \"Dar Vorona. Gift of the Raven. I am my father's gift.\" \"The raven is holding a bloody sword.\" \"I never said it was a nice gift.\u201d What is interesting about this main character is that, for the first time in my life or so, I actually never predicted what she would say or answer. She was completely unpredictable, a little reckless sometimes I admit, but definitely entertaining and intelligent too. The world-building is one of the things I liked best about this first book in a series, along with every element composing it, such as the characters, the different types of supernatural creatures, the magic which was fitting the plot well, the mystery which held me captive until the very last page, the pacing that was at a perfect speed and the little bit of romance that the author aloud us to witness. \u201cYou will tell me what you know now,\" he said. \"Or?\" He said nothing, so I elaborated. \"See, this kind of threat usually has an 'or' attached to it. Or an 'and'. 'Tell me and I'll allow you to live' or something like that.\u201d I saw some reviewers complaining about the writing style which they mostly found not of their liking, but I truly thought it was good. I do admit that the author\u2019s way of describing characters wasn\u2019t impressive at all and could get pretty boring since it consisted a lot of doing an enumeration but, since it doesn\u2019t happen that often, it didn\u2019t come to actually bother me. You know, truth be told, I regret a bit not starting this sooner, since I absolutely ended up LOVING IT. The atmosphere was likable, the protagonist perfectly right for this kind of story and everything inside it had a meaning and wasn\u2019t there to just fill some empty space. So, I would highly highly recommend this story to you, if you normally enjoy urban fantasy books. ...more I've read enough urban fantasy to know that the genre is extremely formulaic, just like, let's say, the genre of historical romance. Basically, you are aware of what exactly you are going to get from the get-go.

Basically, you are aware of what exactly you are going to get from the get-go. The difficulty here is to find a series whose standard mix of ass-kicking heroine/amusing cast of secondary characters/lore/mystery/paranormal hunk that suits your personal preferences. Unfortunately, I will have to put \"Magic Bites\" into the pile of urban fantasy I doubt I will ever get back to, along with Richelle Mead's \"Storm Born\" and Patricia Briggs' \"Moon Called.\" The weakest part of the book is definitely the writing. I can see how Ilona Andrews might have lost numerous readers within just the first couple of chapters. She throws us in the middle of her world without explaining anything at all. Only pages later do we get enough information to understand previous events. A perfect example is the opening scene of \"Magic Bites\" where Kate throws a knife into a vampire's throat and then this vampire starts talking to her in a voice of some other character. Finally two chapters later you find out that in Andrews' world vampires are basically brainless zombies who are operated by necronavigators. This kind of thing happens repeatedly. Some readers might enjoy such cryptic type of writing based on extensive withholding of information. I personally don't find it enjoyable, unless it's written by Margaret Atwood or Megan Whalen Turner. However in this case I don't think the effect is intentional, it seems to be more indicative of poor writing skills. I might have overlooked the bad writing (after all, you do eventually get a better understanding of the world and start keeping up with the events), if only I felt attached to the world or the characters. No luck here unfortunately. Patricia Briggs calls \"Magic Bites\" \"an edgy, dark fantasy, touched with just the right amount of humor\" in her blurb on the book cover. The novel is not particularly (or at all) humorous, but it is dark indeed. In fact, \"Magic Bites\" is probably the darkest and goriest urban fantasy I've come across so far. Andrews doesn't shy away from incorporating split open chests, exposed colons, dead flesh eating monsters, etc. in her novel. So if you are not into this kind of thing, you might want to reconsider reading this book. I appreciate the author's attempt to reshape traditional werewolf/vampire lore with a touch of Slavic mythology added in. Sometimes it works (I liked the shapechanger concept), sometimes it seems ridiculous (\"feeding\" your sword a mixture of wheat with some iron bits). I personally find this world ugly and very vaguely defined. For instance, I still have no understanding of what exactly \"magic\" is. Is it some kind of energy force? Who can be in possession of magic? How is it used? I've seen it operate cars, I've seen it applied telepathically, through incantation, via a sword, with the help of herbs in this book. I still have no idea what it is. I would also love to gain a better understanding of the relationship between the human and magic world. Do they co-exist? How much are they aware of each other? What is humans' attitude towards the magical creatures and vice versa? Or I would love to know what exactly the Guild and its diviners and protectors do. Or what Kate does as a mercenary. And finally, the main character. Kate Daniels will appeal to you if you like your heroines tough, almost man-like, very gloomy, with no sense of humor and irresistibly appealing to all the males in the vicinity (to be fair, this is a common theme in urban fantasy). I would have liked her more if Andrews didn't write her so ever defiant and in constant need to get confrontational with every person (man) of power around her. She softens up a little bit towards the end of the book, but unfortunately too late in the game for me to change my opinion about her. Overall, \"Magic Bites\" didn't quite work for me. The mystery kept me turning pages, but I finished the book without a desire to continue on with the series. It doesn't mean, however, that this novel will not work for you. It might, especially if you like your urban fantasy dark and gory and your sword-wielding heroines tough and defiant. ...more \u2763 KD is the Cure to All of Life's Problems Buddy Read (KDitCtAoLPBR\u2122) with my dear wife Ange , and the poor souls who have fallen into our deathly KD Surprise Reread Trap (KSRT\u2122) \u2763 \u27bd Last reread : April 27, 2016. \u270e Original rating : 5 stars \u270e Rating after xxxxxx rereads : 10 stars.

I don\u2019t know that I have ever said I wished that an UF novel was longer, but in this case I do because with the added length it may have been easier to show me (rather than tell me) the differences between Kate\u2019s world and my own world. The writing in this novel is rather simplistic, however, it flows well and has a natural progression from situation to situation that I have to admire. A LOT. I never felt like this story was awkward or forced, in any way. Sometimes I\u2019ve felt like an author foisted a situation onto their character that was fake feeling or served a dramatic agenda; there was none of that here. I can\u2019t say how much I appreciate having a convoluted story that feels like a natural web of moments weaving themselves into a conclusion of a mystery, it is a very lovely talent to possess. Kate Daniels, You are a badass of the first Order! (You should take it as a supreme compliment when I use a River Tam gif to express your badassary!) I look forward to continuing with this series. I quite enjoyed Kate\u2019s snarky attitude and her banter with Curran is exquisite. I can\u2019t wait to find out about the hinted-to secret that makes Kate carry around gasoline on her person at all times. He gave me a puzzled look. \u201cI\u2019m the one protecting you.

And, strangely, I was slightly disappointed. Why? Well, I know this world and Kate so well now that I expected a magical wonderland when I read it again. But, there were problems that I didn't remember. Problem 1: Worldbuilding There were info-dumps galore. Pages and pages of them. But, we are never actually given a reason why the world changed from what we know now to a magic-infested one. There was no cataclysmic event, war, or I reread this one with the girls at the Ilona Andrews Addicts group. And, strangely, I was slightly disappointed. Why?

There was no cataclysmic event, war, or virus that changed things. It just was. Problem 2: The Alpha Asshole I've known Curran for umpteen books now and think of him as Mr. Awesome. But, I had totally forgotten that he started out as an insufferable asshole in this first book. I truly hated him and now I wish that Kate and him never get together. She deserves better. Like Hugh, for example. lol! Problem 3: Overly Descriptive Scenes You know how I feel when an author takes a full page to describe the sunset: Stabby. That's right. I read because I use this thing called my imagination, therefore I can imagine the sunset on my own. Also, I don't care what exact shade the wood is or what flowers are in the vase in a room that is simply a place that they will stand in and talk for a few minutes. It doesn't matter. It doesn't help build the scene. Get to the point, dammit! Conclusion All this is to say: maybe you can't go home again. It's never the way you remembered it. Do I still love Kate Daniels and everything else written by Ilona Andrews? Yes. And, hey, I admit that I'm a critical bitch. That's my best quality. I am just saying that I now realize that the series started off a little rocky. It is still an amazing series and Kate is still my favorite girl. And, I still want everyone to read this series. Just, maybe give it a couple of books, and then the magic will happen. ...more Actual rating: 3.5 stars Well . . . damn. This didn't turn out as I'd planned.

While reading this I kept thinking to myself, Just go with three stars, almost everyone else you know has. The series will get better as it goes, just as everyone says, then you can rave and give them four. Although there were plenty things that bothered me about this, there were still more things that I liked. In fact, I would say that this surpassed my expectations. But let us get the bad stuff out of the way first: I think my biggest problem was the beginning. All of a sudden you're thrust into this world where vampires are more reptilian/alien-esque Spider-Men than the (supposedly) gorgeous immortal gods we're currently used to (which is rather nice, actually), and there's talk of dhaes and I'm like, what the hell are those? I think there should've been some type of guide in the beginning or a prologue where Kate does an introduction of the world you're about to enter. Like a preparation chapter or something. Even though I was a little leery of her at first, I quickly grew to like Kate. She has one of those personalities that you have to get used to, but once you do she isn't bad. She has spunk and I like how simple she tries to keep her life even in the midst of the chaotic world she lives in. And I think we've only touched the surface when it comes to the magic she can wield. I kept thinking that when Kate met the Beast Lord a.k.a. Curran, he would have a long mane of golden hair \u2014 you know, because he's a lion shapechanger \u2014 well, if it had turned out that way, that would've undoubtedly been the end for me. Thankfully, that wasn't the case. Curran is described as having blonde hair that is too short to grab. Yahtzee. The romance in this is very light, which is nice when compared to the sex fest I read not long ago. Still, I enjoy a little romance in my reading, so I'm interested to see if anything arises between Kate and Curran one of the men in her life in the next installment. In Magic Bites Kate has a love interest for a short time but things didn't really seem right between them IMO. But there does seem to be some sexual tension (or is that just plain ol' tension?) between Kate and Curran. We shall see what becomes of that. Although this has nothing to do with the book itself, it begs to be mentioned: I hate the cover. It looks like an amateur design effort and the girl looks like an unsuccessful* hooker brandishing a sword. Plus her nose looks as big as the cat's and she's wearing too much makeup to be the always-fuctionally-dressed Kate Daniels. Just an observation. I do see a lot of potential in this series and if the ratings are anything to go by, this series gets better. So I'm quite anxious to begin the reading the sequel, Magic Burns . *Unsuccessful because there is no man in his right mind who would go near a hooker with a sword. I'm sure you get my meaning. ***************************************************************** My reviews of other titles in this series: Book #2 - Magic Burns Book #3 - Magic Strikes Book #4 - Magic Bleeds ...more Early 2015 It was just another day in the GoodReads community. I had just found out that you can add people as friends (yep, took me a few years...Buddy reading literally blew my mind!) and I was minding my own business, reading fantasy books as usual. When suddenly, a new message started popping out: And that's how I found out about a series called Kate Daniels . Apparently, I was one of the very few who had no idea what the whole hype was all about. Before long, my updates page was buzzing with me Early 2015 It was just another day in the GoodReads community. I had just found out that you can add people as friends (yep, took me a few years...Buddy reading literally blew my mind!) and I was minding my own business, reading fantasy books as usual. When suddenly, a new message started popping out: And that's how I found out about a series called Kate Daniels . Apparently, I was one of the very few who had no idea what the whole hype was all about. Before long, my updates page was buzzing with messages, groups of people rereading the whole series and speculating on what will happen next! It reminded me of my experience with the Harry Potter books with one major problem - I wasn't part of the Fandom! I was missing out on something huge?! It's like the feeling you get when all of your friends are going to an extravagant party... ...and you're the only one not invited! And they all know it and look at you with pity in their eyes (that's what I do to people who haven't read the Harry Potter books, hehehe, they deserve it XD). So, naturally, while we were discussing favorite series, the name Kate Daniels will pop out almost instantly and people would start recommending the books, praising them to no end until I was convinced I must've lived in a cave all this time. There was only one thing to do: So, how do you review one of the most loved and cherished books amongst the Goodreads community? Obviously, words weren't enough, so I did the only thing I'm slightly less crappy at than writing - I drew stuff (cause pictures are supposed to help get points across...somehow?) And the verdict is: I thought it was kind of... meh? *flies away to another galaxy* THE END ... I really really really wanted to LOVE this book, to go crazy about the romance between Kate and Curran, to swoon over the Beast Lord like everybody else, to be completely emerged in this post-apocalyptic world, where magic is real and monsters lurk at every corner. But I didn't. Don't ask why, I can't even explain it myself...well, I CAN, but then 99% of whoever's reading this sad excuse of a review will disagree anyways, so why bother? ...And because I'm feeling rather suicidal, here is a quick list of what didn't work for me the most: (view spoiler) [ -Undeveloped world-building + nagging feeling of a deja-vu (Mercy Thompson, Anita Blake, Written in Red, Jane Yellowrock, etc.), a city inhabited by shapeshifters, vampires, fairies and so on, doesn't seem that... unordinary or exciting anymore. Nothing to set it apart for me from most other UFs I've read. -Protagonist - hilarious, strong and courageous. However, boring, excessively (and needlessly in some cases) violent, never surprised me and the constant self-sacrifice attempts for the greater good (there were at least 3) were just too much for me to care by the end. Didn't feel like a real person to me. -Romance - Alpha-male romance worked for me in the Fever series, but that's because it took time to develop. Here, it seemed forced, shallow and too basic. I've been assured it gets better later on. -Story - some monster wants to rape Kate, impregnate her and feed her to the baby...this was repeated so many times (by Kate, Curran, bad guy) to the point where it just sounded ridiculous. Kate is also extra special and super powerful. Curran is a pack leader with anger-management issues? Who appointed him in the first place?!? Oh, and there is a human boyfriend-material who wanted to get into Kate's jeans. (hide spoiler) ] Yep, I'd better run for my life now... XD As you can see, yes, I could point out each element that didn't work for me, all the flows that I've noticed and every thing that I found lacking, but, in the end, we don't love a book, because it's perfect. We love it because a part of it resonates with a part of who we are. After all, the version of Magic Bites I saw in my head is completely different and unique from the way each one of us experienced the book to begin with. The version I saw wasn't doing it for me - I can blame my lack of imagination, my Urban Fantasy fatigue or my personal annoyance with life in general. So please don't kill hate me... XD With all that being said, I'm not giving up on the series. I'll still try the second and probably the third book, and who knows, might be enough to get me hooked. But for now, I'll just have to face the hard truth - I'm not a Kate Daniels fan (yet). I won't get excited when a new book is announced, I won't participate in the buddy reads for the ninth book or scream my heart out whenever someone posts a fanart of Curran. My life will be a never-ending misery...

She is thrown into the world of Shapeshifters, Vampires and the People, and must make ruthless decisions in order to find the killer. I didn't know what to expect going into this book. I've been a long time fan of urban fantasy/paranormal romance and have been searching for a series to fill in the gap of series I have finished by authors such as Kim Harrison, Patricia Briggs and Kelley Armstrong.

He did not fall down to his feet, kiss my shoes, and promise me the world. I must be getting rusty.\u201d I absolutely love the character of Kate. She's not your typical heroine, she's a smart ass, a fighter, a mercenary and yet so emotionally vulnerable at the same time. The 260 pages or so of this first book was not enough time with her, and I look forward to reading her development in the other installments. \u201cYou know anything about investigative work?\" \"Sure. Annoy the people involved until the guilt party tries to make you go away.\u201d The world building style reminded me a bit of Harrison's Rachel Morgan series, in that Andrews threw you into this new world with little to no explanations as to how it came to be, and as a reader you were on your own. I personally like that because to me, the reader is as smart as you make them . Many authors assume their reader needs to be lead on a leash through their worlds and that's not always the case. Ilona Andrews gave the reader the chance to use their intelligence and I greatly appreciated it. Curran. That Beast Lord. I already am Team Curran but it's just book 1, so I shall see. There wasn't exactly a romance between Kate and Curran, but there is a tangible sexual tension that made me giggle and smile whenever they had scenes together in the book. Plus, he's an alpha male, and I love the alpha males. Another character I loved was Nick, the Crusader, but more because he reminded me a lot of Captain America's Winter Soldier. I think he'll have a great character arc. Enough rambling on my part. This was a fantastic book and you should read it. ...more Kate Daniels Buddy Read/Reread starts April 27 with the gang at Ilona Andrews Addicts (IAA) Let the fun and games begin , Yes it is still only a 3.5 star read but I really enjoyed it all over again.

Only beaten just slightly by books 1-5 of Karen Marie Moning 's Fever Series . 3.5 Stars Re-read 25Jun2014 before the release of Magic Breaks I forgot the entire plot to this book and it was like reading it all over again. Sure I remembered ALL the interactions between Kate and Curran and I remember meeting Derek for the first time. But I had totally forgotten who the bad guy was and why. I guess we all know what I really cared about. I even forgot there was a Zombie Dragon!!! A freaking Zombie Dragon and I had totally forgotten about it\u2026.bad Robin\u2026Bad. This was my first Ilona Andrews (IA) book ( I\u2019ve read 14 now, including the novellas ) and it is also my lowest rated IA book. It all just gets better from here. They have come a long way as a writing team and I enjoyed this book maybe even a little more the second time through. I love the early Kate and all the posturing she and Curran do to prove who is top dog or cat as the case may be. The humor is still there but it gets so much better in the later books. I enjoyed the beginning a little more because I understand the magic or this world and I could focus on other details this time around. The 7th book Magic Breaks will be out the end of July and it completes an entire plot arc so if you are looking for a fun PRN/UF series I highly suggest this one, cheesy Narnia-esk cover not-with-standing . Initial Review 21Sept13 I\u2019m going to admit that I put off reading this based solely on the cover for a long time. I saw the lion and thought, shades of Narnia, no thanks, I\u2019ll pass. But, I was assured that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth and was talked into reading it. So thanks to all those who peer pressured me, you know who you are. Kate Daniels takes a different approach to solving mysteries and getting things done. \u201cAnnoy principals involved until the guilty party decides to kill you.\u201d Now in most books that is how the story works but the characters never use it as an actual strategy. That was the first reason I liked this book. Warning: the world in this book is really different from any other UPF I\u2019ve read and it takes a little getting used to. The author doesn\u2019t ever succumb to the info drop and just trusts the reader to wait as the world is uncovered bit by bit. It takes time to do it this way but in the end I like the result a lot better. This is a world where magic and technology sort of shift like the tides. When one is in full swing the other doesn\u2019t really work. People have learned to live in two worlds that are together and separate all at the same time. Although somewhat confusing while you are figuring out the world that is being presented by the author it is fascinating and was almost as much a draw for me as the story line. Kate Daniels is a girl shrouded in some mystery and I can see from this first book that she is going to kick some butt throughout the series. She is not a damsel in distress although she is vulnerable at times. Magic Bites has started to set up her character quite well and while we get a glimpse at who Kate Daniels is I do have a feeling we have only scratched the surface. \u201cSo you admit to being a walking stereotype?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s safer that way,\u201d I said honestly. There is plenty going on as Kate tries to figure out who killed her guardian. She has been alone for so long that it is difficult to play well with others. Even though she is defiant of authority and often does or says things she knows she shouldn\u2019t, Kate remains very likable which not every heroine can pull off. Diplomacy was never my strong suit and my patience had run dry. I crouched and called out, \u201cHere, kitty, kitty, kitty.\u201d Teaming up with the local were-pack has some hardships of its own especially for Kate who can\u2019t just lay down and show her belly to the alpha of the pack no matter how hot he is. A battle of wills at hand and Kate might just be in over her head. Overall the story was entertaining, I enjoyed getting to know Kate, Curran definitely has some possibilities and the world captured my imagination. I will definitely be reading on in the series to see where the larger story arc goes. ...more Oh, well. What do they say?

I would be perfectly fine with this if the purpose of being introductory was fulfilled, which, with my greatest disappointment, it wasn't. I didn't think I could ever say something like this, but this book brought me to the point of craving an info-dump: important notions regarding the world Kate and the other characters move in are taken for granted , leaving the readers at their guess, other things are only hinted, the most disparate pieces of information are provided here and here forming a larger picture with too little order in it to seem uniform and consistent. I often felt more confused than anything, actually. But then again, this world also contain a great variety of elements that looks incredibly promising for the future, if paired with more definition and attention to the details. \u2022I had some problem with the pace . This book made something happen to me that I'm a bit ashamed of: it made me fall asleep. I never fall asleep while I'm reading. If I'm tired or the book does no hold my attention anymore, I reach the end of the paragraph, close the book and go to bed. Here I fell asleep with the blasted thing still open. And I wasn't even particularly tired. But beware, it's not that the book is boring. It just feels annoyingly repetitive and unoriginal at times, and more than once I found myself wondering why I was still reading. But the thing is, I kept reading nonetheless . That must mean something. \u2022That must mean something, and I can also point out why: first of all, the interactions between the characters are often funny and always natural and spontaneous , also because the cast is pretty interesting, and I adore how the Andrews write their main characters. \u2022On second thought, I adore how the Andrews write, period . \u2022 Kate , the main character, is wonderful . Any other adjective would be superfluous, but I have never been a girl of few words and have no intention to become one anytime soon, so: you know when a ya fantasy/sci-fi book promise you a kick-ass heroine, right? And you duly find yourself stuck with an insufferable brat that make you want to be able to sneak into the book just to punch her in the face? Well, people, the dark days are over. Kick-ass heroine 2.0 has been delivered, with a sharp tongue and witty retorts to boot . Enjoy. ...more Five reasons why owning a Beast Lord would kick ass 1. Getting dinner has never been this easy . I always have a hard time finding a good place to order my food from. Order, yes, since I\u2019m too lazy to go out sometimes.

I\u2019m actually talking about that awesome restaurant that\u2019s at the end of the city and doesn\u2019t deliver to my street because I\u2019m too far away. The lazy bastards! So I can just send my Beast Lord to fetch it for me since he needs a stretch of legs. Fastest delivery ever! 2. Lose weight like a boss . Sometimes all that chocolate I eat goes all the way to my ass. My husband might like it but I still like to fit in my favourite pair of jeans! Here\u2019s where my Beast Lord comes in for the rescue. Beast Lords need to eat a lot. And I mean A LOT. Since I can\u2019t afford to pay so much for food I\u2019ll simply give him half of what I\u2019m eating. And what do you know? I\u2019ll probably be underweight in less than a week. What fun! 3. Redecorate your house every month . With all that running around it\u2019s inevitable not to get casualties. Curran: \u201cLook! Squirrel!\u201d \u2013 there goes my new lamp Curran: \u201cLook! Ball!\u201d- there goes my new couch Curran: \u201cAAAAAA! Vacuum!\u201d- there goes my living room 4. Be the most fashionable girl out there . Did you know that Beast Lords have the best sense of fashion? Yes they do! And since they\u2019re such sweethearts they share everything they know with their owners. I always have a hard time finding what to wear when I go out. I keep staring at my closet and no ideas pop in my mind. Curran just jumps into my room and chooses my clothes. And what do you know? Everyone compliments me, everyone is jealous. Yes it\u2019s totally because I\u2019m gorgeous and not because of the growling Beast Lord that\u2019s standing behind me. 5. Smile like there\u2019s no tomorrow . The last and best, in my humble opinion, reason of all. Carnage! Since I hate almost everyone around me, I tend to get upset a lot. Why? Simple question. Because most of the people I know are idiots. So here I am doing my thing (aka: plotting world domination) when my dear Beast Lord brings me a gift: a severed head. And what do you know? It belongs to the chick who bought the last Nutella I wanted today at the supermarket! I get bloody when it comes to my Nutella. ...more Buddy read with Armina , Eilonwy , and Asya . By the time this book was published, Jim Butcher's Dresden Files series was already well-known with quite a lot of writers trying to copy it with the various degree of success.

I am willing to bet any money Kate Daniels was inspired by Dresden Files, directly or indirectly. For this reason I will compare these two. Here we have a female protagonist Kate Daniels who happened to be a mercenary who makes her living cleaning up magical problems. You see, she lives in a post-apocalyptic Atlanta with her world switching back and forth between technological based (our own) and magic based with a lot of nasty magical creatures and bad wizards creating all kinds of trouble. For me this set up was much more believable than Dresden's where people live side-by-side with magic and just choose to ignore it exists. Kate's mentor and friend was killed, and she is hell-bent on finding the culprit. I will be the first one to admit it is much easier to write a male protagonist who solves magic problems by exterminating them than a female one. In the former case one can combine Conan the Barbarian with Rambo and get somewhat believable - if completely one-dimensional - character. In the latter case the same guy can be slapped with a name Peggy or Mary (the examples do exist), but all the remaining shreds of believability would go out of the window. I am happy to say Kat Daniels as a female kick-ass protagonist works - almost. She does have her weaknesses and she admits to having them. There are a lot of drop-dead gorgeous women and extremely handsome guys in the book with quite a few of the latter falling head over heels for Kate, but these are required tropes for the genre. Speaking about falling in love, there is some romance in there, but not enough to qualify for paranormal romance status. I am really glad to say the romance never got in the way of the plot. There is something else which was refreshing about the series. The major part of urban fantasy monsters come from Celtic mythology which became kind of old at this time. Kate meets monsters bases on Slavic (this obviously comes from one of the authors being Russian), Chinese, and some other myths from around the world. Kate's wisecracking is on the level with that of Harry Dresden; she does not take herself seriously even in the face of a great danger (\"Here kitty, do you want some milk?\"). As a debut book it is stronger then Dresden Files. It is also a very easy and fast read. Regarding the negative points - other than the ones I already mentioned - the main villain seems to come out of nowhere and was not believable at all. My rating would be slightly above 3.5 stars, but I always cut some slack for the first published book, so 4 stars it is.

That is to say, together they come up with the characters and plot, then Ilona writes the book, and finally the two of them wrangle over editing/general clean-up. Awesome, no? I have to say what I liked best about this first book is the crazy, psychedelic Atlanta it takes place in. This alternate city is saturated in daily waves of magic that doggedly eat away at any signs of civilization and/or technology. The city's skyscrapers are no more than dwindling piles of granite and steel. Magic and technology are basically anathema in this world and the inhabitants of Atlanta live a sort of refugee-type half life. Having adapted to the dark surges when the electricity and cars stop working and people take to horse-drawn carriages and camp stoves. During these times the supernatural rules and mere humans get by. It reminded me vaguely of the gritty, post apocalyptic world Robin McKinley created in Sunshine . The vampires share a few common characteristics as well, their extremely gruesome appearance being at the top of the list. It's nice to see someone else bucking the current beautiful and seductive trend. Not that I have anything against your run-of-the-mill sparkly vampire. It's just fun to see the ubercreepy version as well. The reader is dropped into Kate Daniels' life without a by-your-leave. Being the somewhat cantankerous reader that I am, I like it when a book challenges me to keep up, grabs me by the throat, shakes me once, and says, \"Immerse yourself or be left in the dust!\" In this world where humans exist side by side with creatures straight out of mythology and nightmare, it was a treat to attempt to navigate it without having everything spoon fed to me. I like Kate. She does share some characteristics with Briggs' Mercy Thompson. She has a sense of humor and she ruthlessly guards her independence. Kate's a bit rougher around the edges than Mercy. She's had a rough past, undoubtedly, but one of the strokes of genius in this series is that the reader doesn't know what Kate is. We know she's something. But we don't know what. And Kate is determined not to tell anyone. Not even the reader. Oh, we'll find out eventually. But I'm all tingly with the mystery of Kate and her powers. ...more I'd been putting this book off for a while because a lot of people compared Kate to Anita Blake and I didn't think I could handle dealing with another emotionally crippled main character, even if she was a bad ass.

Who wouldn't beat themselves up after their oversight led to more people dying? This book was an easy/quick read with a few holes in it (Why don't combustion engines work when tech falls? What causes these fluctuations in the first place?) but still managed to pull emotional responses from me.

Kate has a dry humor, she can even be a bit of a smart ass, but she knows when to hold her tongue and she doesn\u2019t push too hard or too far. She\u2019s an ass kicking, sword welding badass and yet, she is remarkably down to earth. She has an astounding wealth of knowledge about the magic saturated world she lives in, but doesn\u2019t struggle with the urge to prove herself beyond what is required to get the job done. In fact, she works damn hard to disguise her assets, preferring to fly under the radar, and as a result, most people underestimate her. She isn\u2019t power or money hungry and doesn\u2019t want the responsibility of others, she just wants to help when she can and then call it a day. Kate isn\u2019t a doormat, nor is she overly aggressive. She kicks ass when the job requires her to do so, but understands the necessity in allowing others to puff up their chests unchallenged. Basically she is cunning, without being hard edged, and very well rounded. She has a tragic past, though the details remain at large. From what I can see, her only flaw is her belief that she will be able to go unnoticed for any length of time, or that going unnoticed would be to her benefit. The world . Magic Bites occurs in a post apocalyptic Atlanta. The buildings sit in enchanted ruin, as fluxes of magic eat away at remaining shreds of humanity and civilization. Humans and their technology still exist; however they live much like fugitives and are only mentioned as prey. The Supernatural Rule. Filled with the standard UF races, Magic Bites possesses shift changers, necromancers, vampires, along with a few invented super human species. Ilona Andrews delights with her take on the traditional lore. Vampires aren\u2019t sleek and sexy; they are grotesque and misshapen, blood crazed creatures, lacking any of the characteristics that once marked them as human. Neat huh? The potential love interest . I say potential because there is no scene within this book that would make me think that Curran loved Kate, or even thought of her as anything other than his link to the Guild and the Order,not that Kate cares. She mainly views Curran as someone to avoid. Nevertheless there is potential for a spark, and I would certainly fan the flames. Curran has a certain something. He\u2019s infuriating, often cruel, but has moments of inexplicable tenderness. He seems to be at war with himself, both in attempts to control his beast and his role as Beast Lord. There is what he must do and what he would want to do if he was free to make the distinction. For the most part he made me grit my teeth, but I like the chemistry between him and Kate. The plot . The plot was incredibly well done. I bought that red-herring hook line and sinker, and just like Kate, felt stupid for not identifying the guilty party right away. In retrospect its obvious. The writing was fast paced, action packed, and there wasn\u2019t a single scene that slowed it down. Not one scene, where you would be okay with skimming if you were to re-read the book. Each scene is crucial to the plot, and you would be truly lost if you were to skim. You may even be lost if you don\u2019t. What I didn\u2019t like: The writing style . Magic Bite\u2019s setting is certainly novel and interesting, but it is seriously lacking in detail. Andrews writes on a need to know basis, and as readers don\u2019t need to know all, or hardly any, specifics about the world in which Kate lives or how it derived to move the plot forward, they are omitted. However, these non-details are alluded to so often that it chafes being left in the dark. It makes the random tidbits of information provided during character conversations murky, and leaves the reader constantly fretting over whether or not they bypassed something important, only to flip back, re-read, and discover that this is indeed the first mention of something new and clearly important. Andrews also omits scenes. For instance, there is one section of the book where Kate is hiding out in the Keep with Curran, promising not to leave and the next scene he is jumping down her throat for leaving the Keep and I couldn\u2019t help but think \u201cWhat? When did this happen? Are pages missing from my copy?\u201d But nope, that is just Andrews writing style and if you are going to read this series, you might as well get used to it. It has its advantages, there is no filler to be found, anywhere, but I\u2019m now beginning to wonder if a little filler is such a bad thing. So to recap, loved the heroine, setting, potential love interest and plot but have a love/hate relationship with the writing style. It\u2019s a very intriguing series, and I obviously still have an abundance of questions that need answering, preferrably sooner rather than later. P.S. I think Kate is Roland\u2019s daughter, who\u2019s with me? ...more 1-st read July 2014 2-nd read May 2016 I enjoyed it as much as I did the first time.

The fantasy world in this story is rather unique - it's set in contemporary Atlanta, but magic has returned. But not like it just switched on, but it comes in waves - so there are times when magic is possible and times when it isn't. Phones work when the tech is up and don't when magic is up. I really liked this aspect of the world and think, as a writer, there is so much potential for lots of complications that can arise because of this. One thing the book lacked - more emotions from Kate. There's a distance and I think it's because this is the authors' first book (right? Anyone know for sure?) and that is a typical weakness with new authors - they don't want to be accused of writing purple prose and flowerly language so they limit the amount of emotion. And it may also be because of the genre. It was more obvious in the beginning of the book - by the end I didn't notice it as much. ...more 3.5 Stars \"Dar Vorona. Gift of the Raven.

I'll just say that my spidey senses are tingling and I have the suspicion I'm gonna freaking love this series. Now, I'm gonna talk about Curran, the magic element and Kate. I'll even say something about the info dump and the world building. But the truth is, I've finished this book with a mighty need for more. I'm giving this book three stars and this is why: The Good: Still not an expert in UF, but this new approach to magic vs tech and how to survive to this era is really cool. The world building is something different, this vampires far from begin romanticized and sparky are actually pretty gross and disgusting. This new order and social acceptance to all things magical give room to a story were there's no Mary Sue trying to understand \"WHY ME??\" o \"HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO SURVIVE?\", you get my drift. Kate is actually an impressive woman with a lot of talents and qualities that either would get her killed anytime soon or will make her the bad boys' n\u00famero uno enemy. There're some pretty honest moments were she feels guilt and shame. I love that from her, even more than her hilarious come backs. \u201cHe finished the bandage and was examining it critically. \"You know those things are unreliable.\" His voice held just a touch of reproach. \u201cEleven out of twelve work fine. I\u2019d say that\u2019s better chances than getting an orgasm with a blind date and women still try.\u201d The Bad: So, great world building, great characters. But my bigger issue was the info dumping here and there. Everything is presented to you as if you already knew all about it. This Masters of the Death and Knight Diviners? What the hell was this book talking about? I had to make some notes along the reading trying to state some facts I knew were important but I had no idea why. That made it difficult to keep up, at least for me. I get Kate's a badass, I sense she's more than just a blade and a few magic tricks. I know there's a past and I can't wait to learn all about it. But I don't know if among all the info dumping was any room left to know her more. It felt like dragging at first and I was not crazy about the writing, either. Also, (view spoiler) [can you explain me why Curran stormed out all furious when they falsely accuse Dr. Perfect of being the bad guy? Wasn't it CURRAN'S IDEA? Either way, she'd proved her loyalty to the Pack \u00ac\u00ac (hide spoiler) ] The awesome : and probably the reason why I'm reading the next book right now. The Curran/Kate banter . Curran doesn't feel like the usual alpha: overprotective, territorial and obnoxious, with \"urges\" beyond his control. On contraire , he seems very in control of himself. And even if I feared him at first, after that \"kitty, kitty\" scene I knew I wanted some more. Every time Kate and Curran were in the same room, you could just feel the tension and urges. But even if all I wanted was for them to kiss already, I'm glad the authors are taking this one step at a time. The roof scene was so cute I almost cry ^^ (view spoiler) [ \"Just a minute.\" I lowered the receiver. \"Curran?\" \"What?\" \"Did you get a call from PAD about me?\" \"I may have.\" \"What did you tell them?\" \"I don't recall. I think I mentioned your discipline and ability to follow orders. I may have said something about you being a team player.\" \"Why?\" I demanded. \"It seemed like a good idea at the time.\" Curran resumed hammering. \"I'm sorry,\" I said into the phone, sticking my finger into my other ear so I could hear. \"His Majesty tends to exaggerate things. I'm not a team player. I'm undisciplined and I have a problem with authority. Also, the Beast Lord can't hammer for shit.\" On the roof Derek was laughing his head off.

Our MC is kind of a mess with her magic and her sword, but that's okay when the big bad kitty decides he likes her and wants to \"help\" her. The vamps do have an interesting twist in species and the whole magic system also has some interesting twists, especially in how all the races tend to mix and match in subtle, almost SF, ways. In fact, I do rather like how the SF features of the world don't play nicely with the magical, and vice-versa. It kinda requires everyone to keep a nice balance going on, but of course that's not really happening with our main couple. It's mostly magic and genes and a lot of power eating. :) No problem. Like I said, a decent introduction. I probably wouldn't have cared enough to continue with the series based on this, alone, but because there's a TON of rave reviews surround this whole series and because I know that UF in general has this problem of slow-starting, I really don't have any problems being patient. It's not like the setup is bad, and I have the benefit of having read a few of the Inkeeper books, so I'm already a fan of the authors. :) Looking forward to reading more! ...more Loved it just like the first time! ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Well damn....I liked it a lot!
