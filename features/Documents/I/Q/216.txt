In fact, I'm with Douglas Adams in calling myself a \"radical atheist\", just to make sure that everyone gets the point. Yes, really. It's in my profile. So my opinion about this book really has nothing to do with my personal convictions. Well, not my personal religious convictions, of which there are none. It has everything to do with my personal convictions as an atheist. And as an atheist, I'm offended by this book. Hitchens is not, and I quote from the numerous book reviews so helpfully printed on the first few pages of my paperback copy,\"witty, impressive, entertaining, funny, challenging\" or, GOD forbid (<---B>pardon the pun</---B>), \"excellent\". He is not even polemical, since that would require some factual discussion. He is simply inflammatory. Hitchens bashes religion in 341 pages, complete with references and an index. (I guess that way he can pretend that his \"work\" has some academic value). Now, the book is called \"God is not great - How Religion poisons everything\". What the hell did she expect this to be, you will probably ask. Let me tell you. I expected this to be a serious, well presented argument of why the world would be better off without religion. I expected there to be a theoretical discussion about how a world without religion can not only work, but work better than one with religion. And I expected there to be a dicussion and dissection of religious beliefs and their influence on human interaction and how these beliefs, in a modern society, are not necessary anymore, and/or are probably even hindering the development of our society. Instead I get 341 pages on the most stupidest things people do in the name of religion, like, fundamentalist muslims telling poor people not to get polio vaccinations, and arguments like 'jews and muslims hate pigs because pigs are dirty and eat their young if they are trapped in little stables, but the muslims completely stole that idea from the jew' (complete with a really touching page on why pigs are really cute animals and that human babies love little pigs. Cause you can never be wrong with the human baby argument.) Cause not eating pigs is really one of the worst problems caused by religions in modern times. Poor pigs, they feel all left out. Well, I don't eat pigs, and I certainly don't think that makes me a bad person. Just a mostly vegetarian one who can't stomach pig meat. But wait, the pig thing is leading somewhere. It is leading, piggies beware, to the oh so representative story of the muslims who, because of the ban on pigs, try to ban things like \"Winnie-the-Pooh\", or \"The Three little piglets\". Because yes, that's certainly a REAL problem, and, you know, EVERY muslim thinks that way. Plus, since America is SO GOOD with its non-censorship policies, it's always a really good idea for Americans to hold up the \"STOP CENSORSHIP\" banner to other nations. (this was sarcasm, in case you couldn't tell). I'm sorry, but almost everyone I know is religious. NO ONE I know is a radical muslim, christian, jew or whatever. Maybe that's why I have the nagging feeling that most religious people are really quite normal and do not propose bans on children's books or tell people not to get vaccinated in the name of god. And I really think pointing out the tiny minority of FREAKS in a religion, any religion, btw, in order to ban the whole thing, is kind of ineffective. What does Hitches want to say with that? That religion is okay, as long as they keep in check the radicals? As a radical atheist, I'm confused. Arguing with the most extreme examples is certain to get you heard, but in my experience, it isn't very effective. It's too easy to say, yes, Hitchens, you are right, but religion isn't really like that. The [insert religious work of your choice] doesn't really say that. And then the normal religious people will lean back and stay as happily religious as they are. That there is a reason why people are religious, that religions have shaped our societies and our behaviors as humans for as long as we can think? Hitchens doesn't mention it. And that there is no more need for religion in the present we live in, that religion has in fact become THE factor that is most likely to hinder the evolution of humans as a race? Not a word. Or wait, maybe he does mention that somewhere in the 241 pages I chose not to read, because I have better things to do with my time. But I doubt it. I bought this book because I was led to believe that Hitchens is one THE top intellectuals of the USA, and one of the important proponents of the so-called \"new atheism\". (whatever that is) If he is, I feel sorry for us \"old atheists\". And I'm calling myself that because I most certainly do not want to be connected to a movement that does itself exactly what it criticizes in religious radicals: attack and condemn, without reason or explanation. That's what Hitchens does in this book. Hitchens may think that he is an atheist, and he may argue on behalf of atheism. But in doing so, he turns his atheism into the one thing that I am strongly against: a new religion. And that does not only offend my as an atheist, it also harms atheism as such. Which is the fundamental difference between me and Hitches: we both are convinced that there is no god. But where I only want people to take responsibility for their own mistakes and to not blame a superior being, where I want them to be human because they are, and not because some religion dictates how and why they should be human, Hitchens does not seem to think that far. He just jumped onto the popular train (\"new\" atheim? Really?) to point his finger at the most outrageous and stupid examples of radical religious people he could find. Newsflash, Mr. Hitchens: there are idiots everywhere, but you cannot judge the whole system upon them. Case in point. P.S.: Oh, and I should probably mention that the book isn't very well written either. The language, especially the first chapter, is pompous. The structure of the \"arguments\" is, at best, random. Also, the author seems to have chosen not to religiously follow the rules of logic. Or to, you know, be logical at all. *closes book and throws it on the sale pile* ...more There's a debate I keep getting into about the difference between atheism and religious belief: someone claims that atheism is just another faith, and I disagree. This seems like a good place to summarize my objections. I would first like to draw a clear distinction between dogmatic and sceptical atheism. If someone blindly believes that there is no God, and no evidence whatsoever would change their opinion, then I quite agree that, for such people, atheism is indeed another religion. (A mathemat There's a debate I keep getting into about the difference between atheism and religious belief: someone claims that atheism is just another faith, and I disagree. This seems like a good place to summarize my objections. I would first like to draw a clear distinction between dogmatic and sceptical atheism. If someone blindly believes that there is no God, and no evidence whatsoever would change their opinion, then I quite agree that, for such people, atheism is indeed another religion. (A mathematician might say that it's the null religion). But most atheists aren't like that. They don't believe in God because they don't see compelling evidence to do so, but, were such evidence produced, they would change their minds. If you still wish to argue that sceptical atheism is a faith, it seems to me that you are in general arguing that one should abolish the distinction between faith and reasoned judgement, a step most people would be reluctant to take. When I say that I don't believe snow is green, my statement is based on having seen a lot of snow. Most of it was white (some was a dirty gray), and none of it was green. If I did see green snow, I'd change my position to saying that snow was usually white, but occasionally green. Of course, evidence isn't always as direct as looking at snow. I don't believe that any mountain in the world is taller than Mount Everest. I have never even been in the Himalayas, and directly verifying the claim would also involve visiting and measuring every mountain in the world, a difficult undertaking. Nonetheless, I have met people whose job it is to verify claims of this kind, and I know that they are good at what they do. If a geographer published an erroneous claim about the identity of the world's tallest mountain, I am sure that another geographer would take great pleasure in showing him that he was wrong, and would try to set the record straight. It's easy to measure the height of a mountain to an accuracy of at worst a metre or two. Soon the debate would be over, and almost everyone would agree. Moving on to things more directly divine, I don't believe that thunder is the sound of the god Thor throwing his hammer. I believe it's the sound of a large-scale electrical discharge made when clouds become sufficiently charged. Again, my evidence is largely based on other people's testimony, but the account of thunder in terms of electrical discharges is solid, coherent and meshes well with things I have seen. For example, discharges created by van der Graaf generators look enough like lightning that it's hard to write that off as a coincidence. I also know that the statistics on the efficacy of lightning conductors are very one-sided. None the less, if I were to meet Thor in person, as Natalie Portman does in the recent movie, I would no doubt revise my opinions. Well: I don't believe in the existence of the monotheistic God who created the universe simply because I don't see enough evidence. My lack of belief in that God is pretty much the same as my lack of belief in green snow, my lack of belief in a mountain taller than Everest and my lack of belief in big blond guys in thunder clouds throwing hammers. If I did see evidence, I'd change my mind. ( Carl Sagan's novel Contact makes this point very nicely). But, until then, I'm sceptical, and I don't see that my scepticism is an act of faith. It's only the normal exercise of reasoned judgement. ...more I read this months ago and never got around to the review...

In our very own country we have troops of well-funded, born-again fanatics preaching hatred of anyone who doesn\u2019t fall in line with their standards. Worse, these groups instill a deep-rooted fear in the most vulnerable, forced members of their congregation; young, helpless, defenseless children, sometimes as young as three. Hitchens provides chilling eye-witness accounts of these tactics which are slowly tearing away at the fabric of this great nation. Regardless of your religious beliefs, if you have an open mind and enjoy reading well written, fact-based, relevant nonfiction, then you will enjoy this book. Certainly, deeply religious people may find certain parts upsetting as fundamental beliefs are challenged with factual, cited information. Hitchens has a way of peeling away the absurdity of certain religious beliefs and how these beliefs, at their very core, are contrary to very ideals shouted to the masses during worship services. Something I learned at an early age, as a baptized Roman Catholic about to be confirmed, is that before anyone blindly accepts what they\u2019ve been told over a period of time about a particular religion, it is your right, your responsibility and your duty to pick up a couple of books about Judaism, Hindu, Islam, Buddhism, Heavens Gate Kool-Aid Lovers or whatever they were all about, even Mormonism and Jehovah Witness, and read. Read about each of these religious. Get a book along the lines of Religion for Dummies (there is a joke in there somewhere) and get an overview of what these groups are all about. Then study philosophy and science and art and history. Read Ayn Rand and Aristotle and Plato and study and research and think for yourself. And then, one day, years later, you\u2019ll realize what is true for you and that will be your own religion. There are too many great stories in Hitchens\u2019 book but some of my personal favorites pertain to religious interference with women\u2019s reproductive rights. Islamic authorities of the Council of Ulemas in Indonesia urged that condoms only be made available to married coupled (HUH?), and then only with a prescription. He also quotes an article from Foreign Policy magazine in which a n official of Pakistan\u2019s AIDS Control Program stated that the [AIDS] problem was smaller in his country because of \u201cbetter social and Islamic values,\u201d This, in a state where the law allows a woman to be sentenced to be gang-raped in order to expiate the \u201cshame\u201d of a crime committed by her brother. Good ol\u2019 repression and denial. The building blocks of religion. Pro or con. Christian or Agnostic. Cubs or White Sox. This book will, if nothing else, be educational and thought-provoking.

But he is particularly fine on the noxious ways in which religion intersects with the most murderous forms of politics. And of course--as is always the case with Hitchens--the book is witty and well written. As a reader of the Nation for over a quarter of a century, I enjoyed Christopher Hitchens political analysis and righteous invective for many years. I always thought he was at his best when he attacked specific individuals for their public positions and private failings, and his refusal--like the best 18th century satirists--to draw any line between the two. I relished his take-downs of Bob Hope, Mel Gibson, Michael Moore and the Dalai Lama, and thought some of his best work was contained in his book-length tirades against Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, and Mother Teresa (the latter book distinguished by its outrageous title, The Missionary Position ). Hitchens was outraged whenever he observed public figures overly praised for their few good deeds, excused for their corrupt habitual practices, and lauded for their wrong-headed opinions. He summoned every fact and argument--fair or unfair--in the service of his eloquent and venomous pen, fashioned an image of himself as a champion of truth, and, in so doing, produced satire of a quality perhaps not seen since the days of Swift and Pope, a quarter of a millennium ago. Unfortunately, Hitchens chooses to apply the same old formula in this attack on the Great Jehovah, and for once he is out of his depth. It is not so much that he lacks knowledge--although his grasp of theological controversy is much weaker than his grip on practical politics--but that he chooses to take God to task in much the same way he formerly used to criticize Jerry Falwell and Jesse Helms. God may very well be a person--as the orthodox Christian theologians maintain--but, if so, he is not a person in the precisely same sense, for example, that George Galloway and Cindy Sheehan are persons. In attacking God himself in this way, Hitchens reveals his own pettiness, appearing less like a great moralist and more like a peevish gadfly. It is a pity too, for many of the great religious crimes he chronicles would constitute, in some other book, a devastating condemnation of organized religion itself. Now, if Hitch would have instead written a book about Bin Laden or Pat Robertson--or about John Paul II or Benedict XVI--what an excellent polemic it might have been! ...more Not long ago, I watched a couple of those \"How The Universe Works\" shows, and it kinda traumatized me.

In however many billions of years, the sun is going to die, and slightly before that the Earth will be incinerated, and everything that we are, were, will be, and will have built will cease to exist. I can comprehend that. Earth's only one part of a solar system in a tiny part of one galaxy of hundreds of billions of galaxies that exist in the vastness of the universe. See? I know that someday (thankfully not very soon), Earth is a goner. But what's hard for me to comprehend is that eventually, the rest of the universe will end too. That's just mind-boggling to me. That something so vast, and so seemingly infinite, can just end ... well, it makes me almost wish that there was something more, to almost want to have faith that there is some sort of creator who set all of this in place and then breathed life into it, and who has a plan and a purpose for what it will eventually become, rather than there being nothing but a ticking clock until the end of everything. Almost, because it's sometimes comforting in the face of the end of all existence. But I don't. Even if I DID have that faith, that would be all. I could never be religious, because I don't believe in religion. And that is the crux of this book for me. A little anecdote before I continue: A couple weeks ago, The Boy's family came to stay with us for a few days to visit. They are religiousy, grace-before-dinner (heh, almost typo'd 'sinner' there), \"God has a plan\" types, who give God credit for everything. They hit all green lights driving through town? God was with them, etc. I try not to get sucked into conversations about religion with The Boy's grandma, because she's a sweet lady who just can't see things being other than how she sees them, and she believes that she's only trying to help me \"find God\". I know she wouldn't understand my lack of desire to have anything to do with religion, so I just avoid the topic altogether whenever possible. The last day of their visit, the inevitable happened and she cornered me while I was making dinner: Her: \"So, have you found a church yet?\" Me: \"Umm, no... OhIhavetocheckthefoodnow... *mumblemumble*\" Her: \"Oh, well you'll find one... you just have to keep trying! You know, you'd really like my church. It's the biggest in the area. We have to drive 45 minutes to get there, but I really like it because it's got gold on the windowsills and they've got their own TV and radio stations and...\" (I zoned out around this point, just holding up my end of the conversation by muttering \"Oh?\" and \"That's nice...\" every time she stopped for air.) Then: \"So, why don't you go to church?\" Me: (DAMMIT!!) \"Oh, well... I don't believe in organized religion.\" Her: \"Oh, you mean like those Catholics? They are always standing and sitting and chanting at just the right times! They are really organized!\" Me: O_o \"Yeahhhhh... that's not exactly the kind of 'organized' I meant...\" Hitchens' point, as the sub-title indicates, is that RELIGION poisons everything. Simply put, it's a pissing contest, winner decided by headcount (or body count, as the case may be), between groups who are each claiming that THEIRS is the Right and One True Religion... and thus intolerance and hatred and fear is born. Religions tell people that they are going to spend eternity in suffering unless they Follow The Rules... when The Rules themselves can cause immense suffering in people, from fear of eternal damnation, to circumcision (both male and female), to homophobic violence, to genocide, just to name a few. Seems like a lose/lose to me. Organized religion seeks (and too often succeeds) to exert control over people's thoughts and behavior, imposing standards of purity that are nearly impossible to attain, even in the most pious believer. But more than that, they also insert themselves into politics, seeking to impose their particular brand of 'morality' on everyone, which inevitably leads to human rights violations and less freedom for people of all beliefs. Religion spawns creatures of such vile ugliness and pure evil that I can't even comprehend them... And that's just the Westboro Baptist Church. Ahh, such wholesome, joyful hatred. I agreed with much of what Hitchens said in this book on the subject of religion, because I do think that can be toxic, but we actually differ on the faith aspect. I felt uncomfortable with some of his attitudes toward people who believe in God/Allah/Buddha/Krishna/etc, resorting to dismissive name-calling several times. I realize that this is a fine line for me to walk, because religion and faith/belief are tied so closely together. But I feel like faith/belief in and of itself is not a bad thing, nor does it make the person who holds it stupid or naive or less worthy of respect. I have no problem with faith, or belief in any God, whatever they may be called. That is an individual's decision and it's personal to them. I make no claims of knowing there is NOT a God, so I cannot say anyone who believes in one is wrong. My issue is when faith is bound up in religion as an institution that uses it as a method of control and intolerance. That is when I feel that a line is crossed, and in my opinion, the result is far more harm than good, if viewed in large-scale terms. ...more Imagine if a basketball fan set out to discredit baseball and converts its adherents to his chosen sport. He would note the rather dubious creation myth still celebrated in the sports' Hall of Fame, the Black Sox scandal, the exclusion of African American players until the 1950s, frequent brawls between teams that literally clear the benches, and two most successful players of the last decade being almost undoubted cheats.

He would note the rather dubious creation myth still celebrated in the sports' Hall of Fame, the Black Sox scandal, the exclusion of African American players until the 1950s, frequent brawls between teams that literally clear the benches, and two most successful players of the last decade being almost undoubted cheats. He could go on to argue that the uniforms are childish, the habits of players disgusting (and their salaries even more so), and the rules hopelessly complex and inconsistent. Finally, he might say, subjecting children to such a game through organized little leagues is perhaps a form of child abuse. After all, it subjects them to needless stress to perform in an environment where even the most successful fail more than half the time and relies on shouting coaches for motivation. The basketball fan might then make a few comments on the beauty of a Larry Bird jumper, the deftness of a Magic Johnson behind-the-back pass, and the awe-inspiring grace of a Jordan dunk and thus safely conclude the argument convinced that his case was proved. Replace baseball with religions and basketball with enlightenment rationalism and you've essentially got God is Not Great. Hitchens' book is a catalog of the sins of religions and a well considered and highly pointed one at that. I found much I want to think over a bit more in my faith after watching it fall under Hitchens's inspection. Still, it seems like the same sort of catalog can be written up about any organized human endeavor and the fact that organized religions are not free of the human stain hardly surprises. What is surprising is the extent to which Hitchens' goes to leave no saint unblemished. Why he chooses to blame Indian partition on Gandhi, when Gandhi advocated contra Jinnah for a united India is beyond me. Similar is the portrayal of Mother Teresa as an opportunistic nun (I am sure the people she served wish there were more such opportunists). I suspect Mother Teresa is cast in such an unfavorable light more from the antipathy Hitchens feels for his fellow polemicist Malcolm Muggeridge, who first filmed her, than anything she's done. (In Hitchens estimation Muggeridge is an idiot as are most people he disagrees with). I suppose an atheist will find most of this comforting, though he may be pricked by a niggling doubt (a similar doubt to the doubt a theist such as myself has when reading some of C.S. Lewis' work) that the case for atheism is just a little too easily made here. ...more I'm probably going to court some hateful comments by trying to write a review of this book, but I think Hitch would be proud that I am making the attempt.

He synthesizes a tremendous amount of research from history, philosophy, science and current events, and he argues that \"religion poisons everything.\" No religion is spared his glare -- he gives time to all faiths and prophets. He makes his case using his great wit and flair for words, and the result is a compelling read. Here are a few favorite passages: \"Many religions now come before us with ingratiating smirks and outspread hands, like an unctuous merchant in a bazaar. They offer consolation and solidarity and uplift, competing as they do in a marketplace. But we have a right to remember how barbarically they behaved when they were strong and were making an offer that people could not refuse. And if we chance to forget what that must have been like, we have only to look at those states and societies where the clergy still has the power to dictate its own terms. The pathetic vestiges of this can still be seen, in modern societies, in the efforts made by religion to secure control over education, or to exempt itself from tax, or to pass laws forbidding people to insult its omnipotent and omniscient deity, or even his prophet.\" [On the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and referencing a speech by Abba Eban] \"Two peoples of roughly equivalent size had a claim to the same land. [Eban said] the solution was, obviously, to create two states side by side. Surely something so evident was within the wit of man to encompass? And so it would have been, decades ago, if the messianic rabbis and mullahs and priests could have been kept out of it. But the exclusive claims to god-given authority, made by hysterical clerics on both sides and further stoked by Armageddon-minded Christians who hope to bring on the Apocalypse (preceded by the death or conversion of all Jews), have made the situation insufferable, and put the whole of humanity in the position of hostage to a quarrel that now features the threat of nuclear war. Religion poisons everything. As well as a menace to civilization, it has become a threat to human survival.\" [On atheism and his co-thinkers] \"Our belief is not a belief. Our principles are not a faith. We do not rely solely upon science and reason, because these are necessary rather than sufficient factors, but we distrust anything that contradicts science or outrages reason. We may differ on many things, but what we respect is free inquiry, openmindedness, and the pursuit of ideas for their own sake ... We are not immune to the lure of wonder and mystery and awe: we have music and art and literature, and find that the serious ethical dilemmas are better handled by Shakespeare and Tolstoy and Schiller and Dostoyevsky and George Eliot than in the mythical morality tales of the holy books. Literature, not scripture, sustains the mind and -- since there is no other metaphor -- also the soul.\" Hitch died in December 2011, and damn how I miss that brilliant, cantankerous ol' rabble-rouser. If you have ever seen him interviewed or heard him give a speech, you know he has a fantastic voice, so I need to make a plug for his audiobooks, which are excellently narrated. And if you want to read some Hitchens but don't want to get all religion-y, I highly recommend his autobiography \"Hitch-22.\" ...more This book is fundamentally flawed in argument, but can be enjoyable to read.

As an atheist, I find the writing enjoyable, intelligent, and humorous. I do not need to be further convinced of the dangers of faith and religion, so I am willing to tolerate fallacies and offensive comments while I enjoy the witty writing. For the religious or the uncertain, however, this book may seem too irreverent and offensive to be of any intellectual value. Few faithful people would be willing to entertain the author's notions long enough to see where he has valid points and separate them from his snideness. This is a true shame, because there are some worthwhile messages. The main message is that religion can be a bad influence on things. Unfortunately, the author phrases this as the fallacious \"religion poisons everything.\" Christopher Hitchens provides many poignant examples of wrongdoing founded in faith and religion, but this does not imply that everything done by religion is bad. It is unfortunate that the conclusion of the book is overstated, because a more cautious assessment of the dangers of religious rejection of reason would be valuable and accessible to more people. I would recommend that people interested in the subject matter instead review the extensive on-line collection of atheist writing. Much of it is more welcoming and less arrogant. www.infidels.org is a good source of such material, and it has an excellent introduction to atheism that is valuable both to atheists and to Christians ( http://www.infidels.org/library/moder... ). The library also includes written works oriented towards people of other faiths as well. ...more So. I've read it, front to back.

Time and again, he holds religious institutions fiercely accountable for their contempt - e.g. organized religion is \"contemptuous of women\" (56) - even as he himself exhibits and condones contempt no less virulent for being on the page than one might see in a religious setting. Indeed, he writes that it is with \"contempt [one must:] regard\" (58) believers who reflect on and/or long to witness the end of the world. People \"must\" regard them with contempt, he writes, \"must\" allowing for no disagreement, no wiggle room. Hitchens here fashions himself the moral arbiter in his arguments against religions having fashioned themselves moral arbiters. Later still, he criticizes Evelyn Waugh's comments about remarriage constituting an addition of spittle in the face of Christ as a wickedness that outstrips Waugh's own infidelities. At this point, I'll make it known that I, too, am critical of Waugh's opinion on remarriage (and of his having expressed it to a friend on the cusp of remarriage), but who except Hitchens has made Hitchens qualified to rank Waugh's wickednesses? Again, his proclamation is arbitrary, and his authority specious at best. Or earlier in the book when he writes: \"The harder work of inquiry, proof, and demonstration is infinitely more rewarding [...:] than any theology\" (71)...according to whom? Hitchens. Later, writing of Spinoza: \"his meditations on the human condition have provided more real consolation to thoughtful people than has any religion\" (262)...again, according to whom? Hitchens. Although, what's even likelier here is a subtle dig at religious people on the whole in the suggestion that none of them is \"thoughtful.\" He makes statement after statement that cannot be made, counting on his snide sense of humor to persuade people into believing their intellects are being used in siding with his arguments, when, in truth, their intellects are being appealed to less than their vanities. No one likes to side with the folks being humiliated (except Christ, anyway), and his wit insures his readers will at least want to side with him, even when their consciences and critical aptitudes discourage it. His incessant rollcall of insults, referring to various believers as \"orangutans\" (56), \"ignoramus\" (64), \"goons\" (275), \"barbarian\" (275), \"pathetic fraud\" (270), \"boobies\" (269), \"hypocrites\" (212) - all language that suggests Hitchens is every bit the \"bigot and [...:] persecutor\" (180) he rakes Martin Luther over the coals for having been. And when he condemns Mahayanna Buddhism's assertion that sometimes (it is perceived) one should be killed in order to preserve untold numbers of lives (203), one cannot but think of Hitchens's own vocal support for the war in Iraq, for the invasion of a sovereign nation on grounds debatable at best, dubious at worst, and resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians. (It also warrants mentioning here that Hitchens's intellectual compatriot Sam Harris has written that a nuclear first strike in which tens of millions might die might be permissible if it meant saving more lives in the long run. Chris Hedges, in his book I Don't Believe in Atheists, takes Harris to task for this.) And then there is his admiration of Socrates's concession that he might have been wrong, Socrates having said \"in effect: I do not know for certain about death and the gods - but I am as certain as I can be that you do not know, either\" (257). This is an attribution Hitchens gives to Socrates, and one he applauds, and likely believes he shares. But the book is evidence otherwise. His cherry-picking in the texts he uses, the spin he brings to bear in the historical epochs he unfolds, and the manipulation of context in which he situates certain literary and scientific appropriations (one would think Dostoevsky hadn't been a Christian! or that Stephen Jay Gould hadn't been conciliatory and respectful to religion!) are embarrassments. Hitchens is a bright man, and he should be bright enough to see that replacing centuries of religious hostilities with 300 pages of secular ridicule does nothing to set the bar higher than it has been. The book is a rant in which numerous good points are made - e.g. \"Human decency is not derived from religion. It precedes it.\" (266) - and in which others are woefully ignored (e.g. that just as human decency precedes religion, so, too, does the impulse - to wreak havoc and cause harm - he attributes to religion itself). One final thing I'll mention is how unfortunate it is that Hitchens cannot seem to fathom the ways in which truth and facts are different entities, if often compliments. He's a literary critic and should know this better than anyone! Just as Northrop Frye has discussed at length, the Old Testament was never intended as a literal document - the culture that conceived of it understood this, so why can't Hitchens? The stories in the Old Testament are not facts and were not meant to be taken as such, so criticizing their being more akin to fables merely because a contingent of modern religious folk have misunderstood their meaning reveals Hitchens's response to be more a reaction than a response and reveals a misunderstanding in him as deep as the one in the literalist perspective of which he's so unforgiving. Ironically, one of the best explanations of the assertion that truth is as often found in an absence of fact as in fact can be seen in Enduring Love, a novel by Ian McEwan - the writer to whom God is not Great is dedicated. In it, Clarissa, a Keats scholar commenting on a disputed urban legend-like encounter between Keats and Wordsworth, says: \"It isn't true, but it tells the truth\" (183). Similarly, the Old Testament isn't true as we understand \"true\" to be \"factual,\" but it does tell the truth - about mankind, his nature, his shortcomings, his sense of longing, his sense of the sacred, etc. Enduring Love's exploration of this question with regard to religion - and not just Keats - plumbs much deeper, too, than I've mentioned here. Again, that Hitchens seems incapable of distinguishing between \"truth\" and \"facts\" or \"data\" is bizarre, given his standing as a literary critic. However learned he is, and whatever the book's nominal pluses, its tone is offensive, its conclusions misguided and its suppositions the product less of inquiry than of resentment. If there were a 1 1/2 star rating to give it, I would, but God is not Great warrants rounding down far more than rounding up. ...more Obviously, anyone who can write a less-than-flattering book about Mother Teresa is not concerned with offending anyone.

So, while I've disagreed with some his past books and ideas, this is one that fellow misanthropic humanists would do well to read. I'm reminded of a favorite Bill Hicks quote: \"Humans? We're a virus with shoes.\" ...more \u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0650 \u06af\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0642\u062f\u0631\u060c \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0650

rainbows, the causal relationship between fucking and dropping babies* - and a way to feel like we had emergency options when we were completely helpless: times of plague, famine and warfare. There were gods we could try to please or mollify by killing things, and then harass for military, climatic and antiviral favors. It usually didn't amount to much, Up til a few hundred years ago, religion used to be our way of understanding all the shit we didn't have answers for - which was a lot... stars, rainbows, the causal relationship between fucking and dropping babies* - and a way to feel like we had emergency options when we were completely helpless: times of plague, famine and warfare. There were gods we could try to please or mollify by killing things, and then harass for military, climatic and antiviral favors. It usually didn't amount to much, but one lucky break in 50 is enough to keep faith alive for the desperate. The gods were like us, capricious and selfish. Then it was god, singular, for very specific and random reasons; archaeologists and anthropologists are still finding fun new evidence to confuse themselves with. In the monotheistic beginning, god wasn't any better than the gods that came as a matching set. He had his own crew, and still acted like a mercurial, genocidal dick. It really wasn't until 2000 years ago that Christianity made excuses for his temper tantrums, and repainted Yahweh as a kind and loving god, despite a shitload of evidence to the contrary. Yahweh originally belonged to his own cozy little pantheon, and even had a wife. But he left his clique behind after a group of Canaanites who were stuck doing the shit-work broke off from the herd, to survive and occasionally thrive as 'the Israelites'. They took this god with them when they left. He was a lesser god in the Canaanite pantheon... or one that came from yet another pantheon, if this group was enslaved and absorbed as a conquered neighbor. Whatever. This persecuted group of future persecuted Israelites felt this deity took care of them when prayers to Ba'al went ignored, and it's possible that this streamlined monotheism, and the strange reluctance to use a proper name, was the result of religious persecution and worship in secrecy, which would happen again centuries later when they were once again enslaved, this time by the Egyptians. His marriage had long since went to hell by that point, and he really didn't like talking about his ex. His name, almost a code now - the 'tetragrammaton', just four consonants, no vowels - was used occasionally, but not often... pronounced today as Yahweh or Jehovah. He was still the blood-and-thunder bad-ass that the Hebrews needed him to be, but he was slowly picking up the loving, motherly characteristics of the wife he left behind once they settled down, moving closer to the Christian concept of god. He wasn't capricious or cruel. He was fair and loving... although he did get drunk with Satan once and pick on Job; he just kind of laughed as the devil killed Job's family, gave him weeping, smelly skin ulcers, and treated him like a bitch... all on a bar-stool bet. He felt bad about it the morning after, though... and made it up to Job with a shiny new family. And an awesome goat. This new-and-improved, loving and caring, monotheistic 'Yahweh' supposedly wasn't governed by human faults and weaknesses, even if he let it slip to Moses we were created in his image. It may seem ridiculous from a modern POV, but it all seemed sensible to them. And Christians, Jews and Muslims are still in denial about this murderous piece of shit. Insecurity is definitely a part of the divine character, since he constantly needs reassurances that we love him, even after the douchebag kills our cats and grandmothers. It's always our fault; 'it's not you, God, it's me'. Those tens of thousands of babies that die every day obviously have it coming for their sins. If god's so deadset against abortion, maybe he should prove it by not killing the children of parents who wanted to start a family. So contrary to whatever his biographers and publicity agents have been telling us for several millennia, god's just as flaky and mercurial as Jupiter and, well... Mercury. Looking back at all the genocidal and sadistic Old Testament tantrums - Sodom and Gomorrah, the Flood, cursing several billion people to pain and death because their great-great-great-great-etc. grandparents ate some fucking fruit - you'd have to conclude that if god did exist, he'd be a psychotic douchebag and all-around piece of shit. Every bit of suffering in the universe was his doing, yet we're still supposed to thank him for shoving this shit sandwich down our collective throat, to grovel and smile and beg for vague nothings via prayer. Yeah... fuck that. If you're... how should I phrase this... stupid enough to bother with a prayer, and -- shockingly -- it doesn't work out... the problem's on your end. Unplug it, plug it back in, and pray harder, ferfucksake. He apparently needs 7 billion people to pray at him daily, so he can look at himself in the quantum mirror and smile/frown/grow tentacles, but he can't be bothered to answer a single one. Are you certain you've done everything right? Yeah? There you go, you're too proud of your righteousness. That's not it? Well... file it under 'moves in mysterious ways'. For the desperate and the stupid, faith is invulnerable to reason. What would you think of a person who bought an ant farm, then tossed it into the furnace a day later because the ants wouldn't tap-dance when he asked politely? God's nuttiness is several orders of magnitude more severe. Thank god for not existing. Now that all those answers religion provided are no longer needed - and wrong about absolutely everything - it's only purpose is to whisper bullshit in the ear of the 'troubled soul', and provide reasons for humanity to kill itself over long outdated lies. We might as well murder each other over slight historical disagreements about Santa Claus. Elves or gnomes? Reindeer or caribou? Scarlet red or cherry red? *(They'd narrowed it down to wind and water as the most likely culprits for pregnancy, before agriculture became a thing and matriarchies became patriarchies; like flint knives and mastering fire, it's hard to know if an understanding of sex led to agriculture, or vice versa.) P.S.: For all those Christian demagogues on Youtube and Facebook and wherever-the-fuck, all those windbags who repeat moronic shit like 'there's no atheists in foxholes': Hitchens spent a long time in that proverbial foxhole, suffering the ravages of terminal cancer; and amazingly, neither his encroaching mortality nor the beauty of cancer inspired any last minute prayers or conversions. In fact, he spent his final days talking publicly about the same blasphemous, irreverent shit he had before god saw fit to smite his articulate ass with the emperor of all maladies. ...more Surprisingly, I wasn't beguiled by this book as much as I thought I would be. I like Hitchens's irreverent delivery on everything -- but this seemed to fall rather flat. (Or at least, \"flattish\"). Couldn't quite put my finger on it, except to say that it seems that any kind of sustained rant has the immediate effect of getting me to tune out.

A rant is a good thing -- get it off your chest, say what you have to say, with good points to back it all up, and then move on. Hitchens lingers on the page just a little too long and makes me feel that not only does religion poison everything, but so do clever intellectuals. Know thyself -- and know when to shut up -- are worthier conceits than verbal diarrhea. I felt much this way in viewing Bill Maher's Religulous . Clever, acerbic, funny, to-the-point: but then he just didn't know where to stop. Hammer to the head, over and over -- and over -- again ... that I took refuge in prayer that it would all end soon. The irony of that! I agree with everything Hitchens (and Maher) says, but for me, once is enough. (That is, tell me once, I learn my lesson and move on.) That being said, he does leave the believers with a lot of food for thought in this simple quote: Violent, irrational, intolerant, allied to racism and tribalism and bigotry, invested in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and coercive toward children: organized religion ought to have a great deal on its conscience. I note, with some temerity, that those words are not applicable only to religion, however, but to the state of political figures making their rise in today's world. Change the title to Man is Not Great, and it would be more applicable. ...more Ever since 'The Trial of Henry Kissinger' I have been a fan of Christopher Hitchens.

I finally picked up the book because I have been on a non-fiction binge lately and I knew that by reading his book I was guaranteed an intelligent treatise. By the time I finished the book, I was very glad that I had read it. Hitchens doesn't so much attack God as he attacks religion. He begins the book by describing himself as a boy, learning passages from the Bible, and the moment he felt that there must not be a God because of a comment his teacher makes. The tales of his boyhood experiences with religion and atheism are used for making his one of his thesis -- that organized religion ruins everything. He points out that it seems one goal of organized religion is to make humans relinquish independent and rational thought. One of the great things about the book is that the chapters are clearly and concisely laid out. In fact, I found the chapter sequence to be quite methodical. As is his usual trait when Hitchens is arguing against something, he builds his arguments gradually and strongly. Right after I bought the book I read online that many people who considered themselves evangelical have bought the book in a sort of know-thy-enemy way. I wonder if they felt like they any kind of rebuttal, because Hitchens -- through his extensive readings and reportage -- has built a historically sound case against the three organized religions. It is worthy to note, while Hitchens does deride some of the beliefs and practices of the big three, he does not sneer of the entirety of the faiths. He knows that there are good people in these faiths who only wish to do good. It the people who take their faiths to the extremes and misinterpret the written word that Hitchens takes most issue with. My only critique is that I do not think he addressed the evolution vs creationism as effectively as he could have. He makes mention of it several times, but does not explore it deeply. Otherwise anyone with any kind of brainpower should read this book. ...more This book received two stars because of the writing. Hitchens writes well. I could have given it five stars for the value it holds for the Christian community - it serves as easy target practice. It is too bad that I only have 4000 characters at my disposal. Otherwise, I would love to go through this book in painstaking detail, pointing out the flabby and flaccid naked emperor while we all point and laugh at how confident the ignorant, intellectually naked emperor struts up and down the street.

Otherwise, I would love to go through this book in painstaking detail, pointing out the flabby and flaccid naked emperor while we all point and laugh at how confident the ignorant, intellectually naked emperor struts up and down the street. There has always been a power struggle between the clear, cogent, and well-reasoned arguments of the philosopher on the one hand, and the bottom-feeding sophist on the other. Hitchens proudly stands in the line of the latter. Hitchens doesn't bother to define \"god,\" \"religion,\" \"poison,\" and how it poisons \"everything.\" Why bother? He and his ilk have already defeated the theist fair and square, no need to take care in how well you argue. Indeed, so sure is Hitchens of the truth of his conclusion that he barely deals with any thing a Christian thinker has had to say, besides Paley. But of course Collins or Dembski would be a better target if you\u2019re going to attack design. (Oh, I think he mentions Agustine, Aquinas, Maimonides, and Newman, just for the purpose of pointing out that they have written \"evil and foolish things.\") He never bothers to engage any serious Christian thinker or argument (no, I am not saying that Agustine, Aquinas, Lewis, &c. are not serious Christian thinkers. I'm saying that he didn't engage them.) No Plantinga, Swinburne, Collins, Alston, Craig, just to name a few. Not only that, but his approach is double minded. For example, he begins by saying that the religious adherent is \"the intended reader of this book.\" But for almost every page after that he subjects his \"intended reader\" to scorn and ridicule. Is this any way to treat your \u201cintended reader?\u201d Indeed, he begins chapter two by asking his reader to imagine that they believe in an all powerful being. But if Christians like me are, as he says, his \"intended audience,\" then we don't have to \"imagine\", now do we? We might as well top this paragraph off by pointing out that Hitchens has a chapter called \"The Tawdriness of the Miraculous and the Decline of Hell.\" But, after speaking about the miraculous, the chapter ends. ... He says nary a word about hell! These were just a couple of lowlights. I could multiply these types of criticisms all too easily. The book claims that Hitchens was named #5 on a list of top 100 intellectuals. Which theist does he unleash the artillery of his massive brain power on? His 4th grade teacher, Mrs. Watts! He spends more time critiquing her than any competent theological or theistic philosopher. He says that we do evil because we evolved that way. So, religion isn't to blame, Mammaw Nature is. He appeals to \"Ockham's razor, yet he doesn't use it, like other naturalists have, to whittle away mental states like beliefs and pain (he relies on these states for his arguments, though). He doesn't use it to whittle away moral claims. There\u2019s much he can\u2019t explain using his razor as he does. He critiques the designer because of poor design, yet he gives no indication that he knows what the design plan was aiming to achieve. You can't call the designer a bad designer without knowing his intentions. And, dysteleogy assumes teleology. He never bothers to address the arguments which seek to show that if our cognitive faculties evolved given a naturalistic understanding of the universe, we have no reason to belief our beliefs are aimed at truth. They'd just be aimed at survival. Hitchens drops the ball over and over again. Unfortunately I don't have the time, or key strokes, to really get into this. Overall, the book was a flop. If this is the best The New Atheism has to offer, theists can relax. ...more Description: In the tradition of Bertrand Russell's Why I Am Not a Christian and Sam Harris's The End of Faith, Christopher Hitchens makes the ultimate case against religion.

I am an atheist myself, however new to the group I might be. Indeed, until a very recent time, I spent a big period of my life believing I\u2019m an agnostic. How do I put this mildly? Agnosticism is the safe route, it\u2019s the one in between the dirty street filled with drug dealers and that very safe boulevard.

Agnosticism is the safe route, it\u2019s the one in between the dirty street filled with drug dealers and that very safe boulevard. It\u2019s the one you\u2019d take if your mom told you to take the shortest route home and you decided to be a bit of a rebel. But just a bit, mind you, not a lot. Because the basic concept of agnosticism, in relation to God, is that \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d. We don\u2019t know, we can\u2019t know, therefore we can\u2019t make suppositions based on thin air. But, what agnosticism offers in return is the acceptance that there is actually something out there, luring in the divine space, waiting for us to recognize it to its true form and power. Basically, you get the \u201csafety-belt\u201d package that allows you to say, if you ever find yourself blamed in front of said divinity, that you couldn\u2019t be sure . Which is, I used to believe, much more acceptable than\u2026 Than atheism, really. Than flat-out acknowledging and believing and living up to this belief that there is no God . If death is not final and you find yourself face to face with the supreme Judge\u2026 you\u2019re fucked. I guess I didn\u2019t want to be a little rebel anymore and blossomed into a full blown hooligan. I have never in my life been a believer. Not a single moment have I said: \u201cI believe in God.\u201d I have been raised with only one rule as guidance: \u201cthink for yourself\u201d. As a kid, my family took me to a vast number of churches, not only of my religion, even if predominantly confined by it; big churches, small churches, some covered in gold, some built of wood, some carved in rock; some with a lot of fervent followers, others with just a lonely, old priest watching over the precincts\u2026 I have visited other countries and entered their churches, seen their shrines, watched their processions. I have had a fair amount of religious visiting done \u2013 but never in the name of God. Not once, in my entire life, have I gone to a church/religious space with the purpose of praying or bowing to the maker. If there was a reason, I guess it was to witness art, beauty in religious architecture, in believer\u2019s paintings, in faith based sacred images. It was to see human-made wonders, ironically. I have shared meals with priests and slept with nuns in their rooms, in the mountains; I have experienced the simplicity that religion can instill into the lives of men and women, who devote their entire beings towards a better existence at the end of their current one. I have also seen the gold-adorned lives some religious people dwell in because of this foolish and completely idiotic belief that a creator would need to be worshipped with precious stones; How, did the creator not also create the poor?.. Or maybe he had an eye for sparkle. I guess my point is, the concept of God in itself was useless to my formation, to my life. I have not had any advantage from being baptized into the Orthodox Church, no real need fulfilled by my affiliation to a certain religious cult. Knowing the Ten Commandments hasn\u2019t overthrown my innate sense of right and wrong. The Genesis hasn\u2019t impaired my ability to understand and believe in the Darwinist model. I have a moral code and fairly tough ethics without having followed God\u2019s rules a single day. My life has been much more impacted upon by the fact that I was born into a white, middle-class, fairly well-off European family and that I have been given the proper education during each stage of my life in order to propel me to my current position and allow me to pursue my (apparently) fucked-up dreams. But, at some point in my intellectual journey, I realized I had to know more about religion. I simply had to . There was no way around it, I had too many questions that hadn\u2019t received answers. What also prompted me to analyze the matter more profoundly was the attitude of religious people in my vicinity when confronted with a non-believer. I have had confrontations (mainly in a scholarly environment, but just as meaningful ones outside of it) with people who had blamed me for my decisions and professed harsh consequences upon my doings, supported by their faith, when all I had done was ask questions . I do have opinions, mind you. I do think religion has become a political/economical tool and that humans have, in their majority, lost the true meaning of it (which is achieving spirituality). Also, on my bitter road filled with deception in becoming an atheist, I found myself more and more disgusted with religious people and faith preachers and church goers, all because of their sense of superiority over me, their smug characters, thinking they have the divinity watching over their backs, that a divinity cares for them, repudiating reason and thinking and skepticism and empirical evidence to the dungeons of hell and their inhabitants to even worse tortures\u2026 I\u2019m sure you could say atheists become atheists because of people more than because of God. I am not one of those who will talk against the concept of God; however, against the fantasies that the Bible (or any other scripture) professes as historically true, I will; against stupidity and racism and extremist followers and the banishment of science, I will; against mindless, spineless and remorseless individuals who coerce their children into fear and revulsion, perpetuating this tradition of imbecility over generations, I will. Against all of that and many more, I will speak up. After all this ranting, I want you to take this away: I understand the need for religion. I understand why we turned to it in the first place and why we still cling to it now. I am not an \u201canti-theist\u201d. I do not speak against God. I question him, his existence, his preaching, his absurd needs and his megalomaniac commands. I judge him, yes, and his followers, as they also judge me in return. You could call it mutual distrust, really. But, if it\u2019s true, if God exists, then I\u2019m content with my atheist position. I believe I have the right to burn in Hell, or in all versions of it that exist. If you are a religious person reading this, please pray to your God that I may suffer. Please, bring the flames on, an eternity of torture for this pitiful apostate that I am! I beg of you, prove me wrong. I\u2019ll be the happiest for that \u2013 indeed, I, in a very sadomasochistic way, look forward to it. I fully intend to burn in Hell if that is the punishment for critical thinking and freedom of opinion. Make crackling strips out of my skin! Scrambled brains out of the contents of my skull! And never grant me forgiveness for wanting to understand the world by the power of my own mind. I don\u2019t need to be excused for my own egocentric nature. Not by someone who is content in giving up his identity to a whimsical being of a far-away land. In any case, if death is not final, I\u2019ll still be going to hell even without being an atheist. I\u2019m a sinner by birth, supposedly. Being an atheist just makes me a conscious one. DONE! Now, let\u2019s move on to an apologetic review that is supposed to be worth reading the whole rant that you just went through\u2026 Oh, well, I doubt it. What I promise I will not talk about: how awesome Christopher Hitchens is. What I will talk about: how awesome Christopher Hitchens\u2019 work is. \u201cGod is not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything\u201d is one in a long series of published papers that Hitchens has dawned upon us readers, that concern the matter of a divine being\u2019s existence. Now, Hitchens is, as Woody Allen so humorously puts it, \u201cthe loyal opposition\u201d. He is an atheist and a very articulate one indeed. When reading his work, you must be aware of the position he is taking: he is against blind faith and all for finding proof. As always, as in his speeches and his essays, he doesn\u2019t cut off the path to discussion; rather he wants to open one. He questions everything, tries to shed light on the scriptures and the relationship between human and divine and all in all succeeds in making a very serious and solid case for his motion. I have read some commentaries that he just mindlessly gives examples about how different people do different bad things in the name of their religion, and the readers who said that were arguing that these are useless extracts. I believe not. Of course he is going to point out what individuals do in the name of religion, that is the exact purpose of it all, how far humans will go and to what extent they will cause suffering and ignite wars and deny the most basic needs to others because of what their God (read: whimsical being of a far-away land with a very serious ego problem) has said. Now, Hitchens doesn\u2019t differentiate between Gods. If one is false, all are. The God\u2019s importance doesn\u2019t reside in the number of his followers, for this author. He talks the same about the three big monotheist religions, as well as about the remote cults of distant lands. The reason why so much of his work is concentrated around the Judaic, Muslim, and Christian preaching is that these three have had a massive effect on our society, as we experience it today. He speaks against them not with the purpose of defiling the \u201cfantasy\u201d itself, but in need to show how ridiculous and irrelevant they are for humanity today. They were very useful in the dawn of time, when volcanoes erupting at every corner and people found dead in the morning could not receive a proper explanation. After all, religion is a very early and very primitive attempt at science! Hitchens doesn\u2019t deny that, and never once attacks the spiritual need of humans to unite and find solace \u2013 what he offers, instead, is solace through knowledge. For all it\u2019s worth it, I need to address the writing. You can see that this man has loved reading since he was a kid. You can see he knows literature in a very intimate way; his choice of words, his rhythm, the subtle irony underlining the entire work, everything points out to a wonderfully complex and cultured mind behind those pages. And cultured he had to be, given the enormity of the subjects he chose to tackle in his entire career. This is, in my opinion, a very good piece of non-fiction writing. It shows through a very thorough research, even if it is centered on finding the right facts to support his claims. I can throw away my subjective, atheist self, look at this work with my objective, detail-obsessed reader\u2019s eye and find only minor twerks in this study. I, for one, love the way Hitchens writes, because I feel he\u2019s having a conversation with me. And, in the end, that is every writer\u2019s dream \u2013 the extension of one\u2019s thoughts into another\u2019s mind without the two actually being in each other\u2019s presence. Atheists \u2026 you know you liked it. Even if it was the sort of: \"oh wow he said it much better than I could have\" like, you enjoyed it. Believers \u2026 you know you can\u2019t deny its truth. Even if you're backed up by all your faith, don't Hitchens' arguments pick at your reason? All the rest \u2026 pick a side. Does Hitchens ask for too much? Just pick a damn side. ...more Growing up w Protestant clergy all over the family (but, most thankfully, loving parents), I never took any of the Blubble seriously, or weekly \"devotionals,\" which one older sister hugged as a way to say to parents, \"Hey, LOVE ME!\" ~ They did.

But to ignore the question completely and occupy ourselves with food and clothing and shopping and entertainment is inexplicable from almost any perspective. If there is even a possibility that death is not the end of our existence, then we ought to be radically concerned with the claims of religion, even if they prove to be false.... God help me..... What makes people to write such scrapy-dappy books just to tell how-highly-intellect they are and in that matter,its their birth-right to get \"distinction\" just by some ridiculously attempted and poorly handled arguments.. and meddling with religion and hurting sentiments of billions of souls out there The new atheism was triggered by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Dawkins, Harris, and others contend that Islamic terrorism is merely a symptom of the intrinsic evil of all religion. Hitchens continues this agenda. He invokes the worst possible examples of religious abuse and condemns it in the strongest possible terms. He is not content to critique religion; he must smash it to bits. Hitchens employs in lieu of science his wide-ranging (if tendentious) knowledge of history and current events in savaging religion of all kinds. His knowledge of history and current events (often gained firsthand as a reporter) may be impressive, but his interpretations and arguments are another matter..... And he seems to be enjoying \"others-matters\"and meddling with them with his own highly-intellectual small head.... But to say the fact,i very rarely come up with over-passionate frantic vibes to advocate God and Faith..I'm not a preacher for heaven's sake! But when you are stabbed hard on your very roots,when you are ridiculed for being \"believer\" of prehistoric and gone-age myths,that has nothing to do anymore with today's world..... you come up with your views and stance...... because if not done so: \"Darkest places in hell are reserved for those who kept their neutrality,at times of crises\" now to book..... Hitchens mainly is concerned with refuting the monotheism of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (although he does spend chapter 14 on Eastern religions, which are not usually monotheistic). He hardly breaks a sweat in arguing that God does not exist; nevertheless, he thinks that he has established it as beyond question. In this, he joins his unbelieving colleagues Dawkins and Harris in dismissing natural theology (the philosophical case for theism) without any serious engagement. For Hitchens\u2019s attack on all gods and religions to be successful, however, he would need to furnish a strong argument denying the supernatural realm. Only then would it follow that all the gods of all the religions would be merely of human design. Hitchens\u2019s arguments against theism are made in chapters 5 (\u201cThe Metaphysical Claims of Religion Are False\u201d) and 6 (\u201cArguments from Design\u201d). These chapters are both thin and shrill; neither demonstrates even the slightest awareness of the philosophically and scientifically sophisticated arguments for the existence of a personal and moral creator and designer of the universe.... Hitchens scavenges around for the worst examples of illogic, ignorance, and outright stupidity in religion. The poor man makes many loud-mouthed appearances in god Is Not Great. And i very honestly got louder-mouth to shut his loud-one but in an equally argumentative manner and a sophisticated in that regard. Hitchens ridicules the argument from design more than he rationally challenges it. He uses the standard argument that nature manifests too many defects to be designed. I got millions of \"instances\" to prove the man a true God-envious,and a grudge-nurture at the same..... But in a nutshell,the thing can be resolved just by the complex and specified informational patterns in DNA that cannot be the result of natural laws because they are too complicated; nor can their specificity be explained by chance combinations because these are too improbable. The best explanation for this genetic language, therefore, is a designer. When Hitchens and others point to the pain, dysfunction, and frustration of nature as an argument against design, The fact that something may appear to have been designed poorly does not mean that it has not been designed at all... Given that Hitchens (and the other new atheists) think that science has displaced God, this is an ironic The Christian/Islamic worldview was the impetus for science for many reasons, but principally because, unlike other worldviews, it deemed nature as good, rational, non-divine, and worthy of investigation and development for the glory of God. There are countless verses in Quran,saying seek and know,contemplate on happenings of nature,changes of seasons,moving of earth and other natural phenomenons. Atheism, on the other hand, lives on borrowed (or stolen) intellectual capital. It must take the rationality and knowability of nature as a brute and inexplicable given, since nature, according to atheism, was not created or designed by a rational Mind. To atheists, mindless matter precedes the appearance of minds. Minds turn up for no reason. Our reasoning just happens to have the resources for developing sophisticated scientific theories about the universe and ingenious ways to harness nature\u2019s potential through technology. how far can we go in petting our swollen egos,by not accepting,what needs to be accepted for our own good.. how far exactly.... Disregarding Miracles and Islamic Scholarship. Of course, no atheist apologetic would be complete without assaults on the Bible and Quran. Hitchens\u2019s criticisms are both high-handed and one-sided; they differ little in form from those of his stature. Hitchens rules out miracles since he believes there is no God, but, as noted, his arguments against God\u2019s existence are inadequate.and entirely subjective at the very clear.... well,I'm not the one defending faith or god here(i need a grand box for that) my job is to say my views of book i recently finished So,forthose who read god Is Not Great without any knowledge of Islam,Christianty philosophy, history, and apologetics easily could surmise that all the rationality is on the side of the atheists and that believers are nothing but benighted and dangerous fools stuck waist deep in premodern superstitions that threaten to poison the civilized world. This view, however, is merely the verdict of the arrogant and the ignorant.

However, since giving unqualified opinions without research or context is exactly the style of this book, I thought it would be thematically appropriate for me to give Christopher Hitchens\u2019s God is Not Great such a distinguished and sought-after position, narrowly edging out its turgid counterpart in the so-called New Atheist genre of literature, The God Delusion. For those of you who are unaware, the New Atheist movement is the newest trend in a la mode godlessness, which is comprised entirely of hastily written and ill-conceived screeds, printed at a pace so rapid that the books\u2019 editors (who presumably exist) don\u2019t have time to actually fact check them. The results are less than compelling for anyone who\u2019s actually done some research (or has access to google). I want to be fair to Hitchens, though. He is easily the most readable and the most fun of any of the New Atheist writers. He had many good books, and he was an astute critic and an incredibly witty writer. His political writing should be mandatory reading even for those who disagree, and his writing on George Orwell likewise. Hitchens was a man of real conviction, and he did not allow his political views to be dictated by party lines. His abhorrence of totalitarianism deeply affected his life, and made him a champion of the oppressed all around the world. And his bravery in the face of death was more than admirable. I don\u2019t want to pile on him too much for this book, especially now that he\u2019s dead, but it\u2019s difficult to deal with the book in a neutral tone, since Hitchens himself dispenses with it immediately. He has no interest in being accommodating, understanding the other side, or even bothering with checking facts. He\u2019s only interested in abuse. He hates religion, he lets you know that he does, and that his book is going to be a smattering of his Very Serious Opinions about the issue. The resulting work consists almost entirely of anecdotes, scandalizing horror stories, and completely distorted history and philosophy, but it\u2019s written in an engaging and readable way. There\u2019s nary an argument to be found, but Hitchens doesn\u2019t really care about that. Arguments are not his game. That leads you, then, to the embarrassing question of trying to figure out what this book is actually supposed to be. It certainly isn\u2019t a defense of atheism. It\u2019s not trying to prove God doesn\u2019t exist, or, at least, it isn\u2019t systematically attempting this. It\u2019s not just an attack on Christianity, since Hitchens levels his shotgun blast at anything and everything religious (which, to him, is pretty much the convenient label for \u201cAll the Things I Don\u2019t Believe In\u201d). All one gets from the book is a meandering rant about how \u201creligion\u201d just freaking ruins everything that\u2019s good, man. But the worst part of it is not even its nonsensical structure, but rather the simple factual errors littered throughout the text (and I\u2019m trying to limit it to objective things, not debatable opinions\u2014the kind of stuff Hitchens could\u2019ve googled to fix). Highlights include: -\tAttributing a damning quote to Thomas Aquinas that not only did he *not* say, but in fact can be found saying the exact opposite. -\tWriting that \u201cmany lives were lost\u201d when the books of the Bible were canonized. The real number is zero. -\tMisunderstanding basic religious terms: thinking that theodicy is a synonym for theology (which is isn\u2019t), and that synoptic is the antonym for apocryphal (which it isn\u2019t). -\tRepeatedly calling Bart Ehrman \u201cBarton.\u201d -\tClaiming Augustine was a big fan of the Wandering Jew myth, which didn\u2019t exist until almost 1000 years after he died. -\tBlaming \u201creligion\u201d for female circumcision (what religion practices this, we are unfortunately never told). -\tClaiming Jesus was born in 4 AD, instead of 4-6 BC. -\tClaiming all four canonical gospels were based on the Q source, when only two are thought to be. -\tClaiming the gnostic gospels were written at the same time as the canonical ones, when virtually every Biblical scholar holds them to have been written decades and centuries later. -\tHitchens condemns the Tamils in Sri Lanka for their invention of suicide bombing. Here, he writes, are examples of the horrors that can be wrought by \"Eastern religions.\" Except for one little detail he overlooked: the Tamil Tigers were led by atheists. It goes on and on. These are just the historical facts. One could easily argue that Hitchens also misrepresents Ockham\u2019s Razor, Nietzsche\u2019s \u201cGod is Dead\u201d comment, Pascal\u2019s Wager, and everything Thomas Aquinas ever wrote. But that\u2019s getting into value judgment territory and I\u2019ll stay away. Either way, it\u2019s almost impossible to keep track of all the misinformation that permeates the book, and the more you try to grab hold of them, the more star systems slip through your fingers. Hitchens was so against religion that he couldn\u2019t just argue that it wasn\u2019t true. He had to also argue that it was purely malignant and could never grant that a single good thing\u2014ever, in the history of humanity (as the ill-conceived subtitle of the book states)\u2014came from it (whatever \u201creligion\u201d in the abstract is anyway). And not only that, but he\u2019s so intoxicated by the idea of religion causing all of the bad things in the world, that he even attempts (in a passage as illogical as it is appalling) to pass off the mass murder of religious people by communist regimes as being somehow also the fault of religion, while simultaneously (and conveniently) presenting the best use of the No True Scotsman Fallacy ever put to paper: Hitchens: No atheist ever killed anyone in the name of atheism. Gulag Survivor: Communist atheists killed in the name of atheism all the time! Hitchens: Well, they are not true atheists. Check and mate. The whole thing is so surreal, it\u2019s unfathomable how something this riddled with errors could even get published. Even in politics\u2014the only other area of study prone to such sensationalism\u2014this would not be permissible. Imagine, if you will, a lone political critic emerging from the forest and informing you\u2014in tones of stirring pomposity\u2014that he\u2019ll never vote Democrat because they\u2019re currently engaged in illegal war in Tajikistan. How do you even begin refuting this? Tell him there is no war? What if he refuses to admit that? Then what? And yet, this is the experience gained from this book; only, the critic\u2019s understanding of Democratic platforms will look painfully charitable by comparison to Hitchen\u2019s views on religion. In summation: read Christopher Hitchens. Just don\u2019t read this book. ...more Well, it's all there in the title. And in case you missed Hitchens' point, he subtly reminds you of it by interjecting the book's subtitle every time he recounts an example of how Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism (yes -- Buddhism!) have brutalized the human race.

Thankfully for us, Great Thinkers such as himself are here to disabuse us of our pathetic and mystical thinking. And while I'm sure he would call me stupid for saying so, I think that Hitchens has replaced one godhead (God, Jehovah, Allah -- whatever you want to call him) with another (secular -- or maybe scientific? -- humanism). And if there's anything I know, it is that you cannot argue with a secular humanist. Here's what made this somewhat shrill and monotone book amusing and even enjoyable for me: Hitchens' belief that no one is as fantastic as himself. What did someone once say about Orson Welles: \"There but for the grace of God goes God\"? Let me give just one example of how Hitchens' stratospheric self-regard colors his view of the world and unintentionally caused me to erupt in laughter. Hitchens tells a story about how he was once on Sri Lanka -- I think -- and was able to get a group of natives out of a potentially dangerous situation, using his wits and his British press card. The men, according to Hitchens, then proceeded to treat him in an extremely respectful, bordering on adulatory, way. Instead of thinking, \"Well, maybe their behavior is their culture's way of expressing gratitude,\" he arrives at the conclusion that they think he is a god. This incident says volumes more about Hitchens' attitude toward himself (or should I say Himself) than it does about the Sri Lankan men. Don't get me wrong: I love reading polemical texts, and this is about as polemical as you can get. And Hitchens is a highly entertaining, erudite, and amusing author -- the kind of guy who drives you bananas but that you secretly want to hang out with, just b/c he *does* say the most outrageous things. But like all polemical texts (including sacred ones!), this one lacks any kind of depth; it refuses to grapple with the complications and strangeness that make up life. It is the kind of book that an intelligent and rebellious 13-year old would love. It is the kind of book that a grown woman might buy and then place prominently on her bookshelf in advance of a maternal visit, just to raise her mother's blood pressure a little. (\"What?! Don't you want to go to HEAVEN?!\") It is not the kind of book that imparts any kind of wisdom or knowledge or understanding. ...more If I could, I would have preferred to give this book 3.5 stars. It was not as good as I had hoped, but not as bad as I feared either.

Hitchens does hit something on the head in noting the monied, f**cked up set that sometimes accompanies Indian-style gurus, but it's interesting that his Buddhist examples of violence are the only two I ever hear referenced - Sri Lanka and the Japanese oppression of China. I think it should be noted that while there are hundreds of examples of Christian violence, the same two examples come up again and again for \"Buddhist violence\". One might think this says something about the \"damage\" done by Buddhism (as compared to the western faiths). Also, while I agree somewhat with his distaste for de-emphasis on the intellect that is sometimes found in zen practice, there are zen schools (namely some Korean) that focus heavily on knowledge. And it's interesting that Hitchens includes no notes/references for the entire Eastern chapter. So, I'm wondering if the Dalai Lama quote on prostitution is taken out of context or if it's very outdated. All this being said about this one chapter, though, I still liked most of the book. And the other citations included reference a great number of books I'd like to now read, namely what I can find about Spinoza and a number of books by Michael Shermer. And overall, though I bristle like Hitchens at the \"Brights\" moniker Richard Dawkins supports, I prefer Dawkins' recent The God Delusion . Namely because it approaches the issue of god from a scientific point of view. Hitchens succeeds at showing some strong examples of the audacity and violence of religious figures and groups (the recurring emphasis on the terrible things religion does to children is particularly salient), but it doesn't really get to the heart of the atheist/believer question. ...more What a book.

Hitchens paints a black and white portrait of any person who has any ounce of religious thought as a fanatical fundamentalist who implicitly accepts any story or claim in any religious text ever written. Because it is largely propoganda, every chapter in this book could be easily countered with an oppositely titled rebuttal. For example 'Religion Kills People' -> 'Religion Saves People'. Anyone with 20 minutes and Google could write that argument (whether it's true or not isnt' the point). This is because Hitchens is not excercising objective thought here, he is running an attack campaign on an opponent of his own dogmatic definition. At it's core this book is a rant deriding fundamentalists, but with it's strict and extreme definitions, at the end of it all you get the feeling like you are laughing at competitors in the special olympics. Yes, some people are bad at religion. A lot of fundamentalists are raging idiots. However, if someone wonders whether there is a God, or even spiritual forces, they do not automatically believe that God made frogs rain in Egypt and saved the Jews with magic sky-bread, a la Hitchens' tunnel vision viewpoint. Hitchens fails to realize that it's not the adherents that need discussing, but the impetus and origins, and as such fails to address any of the questions that deserve real inquiry. Why do we find religion in every human culture ever encountered? Why do these ideas resonate with us, not to mention, what about the questions or fears they try to assuage in the first place? Just because some ideas are poorly concieved doesn't mean the inspirations are illegitimate. At the end of it, this book is little more than the literary equivalent of internet flame bait. p.s. Hitchens' closing remark that religion is obsolete because the Internet provides wider access to literature and poetry is one of the most laughable things I've ever read. Besides barely making sense, it's a statement that makes me think, after writing an entire book on the subject, Hitchens still has no idea what draws people to religion in the first place. ...more This book was recommended to me by a friend several times before I finally gave it a shot.

I was a little wary from the title...I enjoy books about religion (and people's escapes from them), but don't have a lot of time for openly, anti-religious folks' emotional whining and ranting. To my pleasant surprise, Christopher Hitchens' book was a joy. Hitchens gradually found himself appalled by the amount of religiously-fueled atrocity on our planet. Our various religious leaders are constantly pointing to the amount of \"evil\" on earth as a sign of man's sinfulness (and demonic tampering), but Hitchens shows, in example after example, that most of the atrocities are carried out by these very religious people themselves. Nobody is spared here: Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, on and on. This book takes an objective look at history and modern life, and points its finger at every instance of war, injustice, persecution, genocide, slavery, racism, ethnic-cleansing, intolerance, child-molestation, etc...and notices that - without exception - these are always propagated by religious ideals. His conclusion is in the title: \"Religion poisons everything.\" The one chapter where he loses my attention is his expose on evolution, and subsequent conclusion that these \"facts\" should be enough to silence all the religiously inclined. There are many people, like myself, who have no problem with the concept of evolution. As much as I have examined the evidence though, I see it as simply another theory lacking any hard evidence. It's handled almost religiously by scientists who, I think, sometimes forget that they are supposed to be scientific. (though Hitchens is not a scientist) For those who are decidedly non-evolutionists, this side-track will weaken Hitchens' overall case for you. Vice versa for those of you who embrace it. Personally, I think this book could have stood just as well (or even better) without it. His other information is difficult to argue with, so this just gives his detractors something to nit-pick about. Hitchen's has an immensely enjoyable writing style, with an elegantly flowing prose resting upon a razor-sharp wit. I had to re-read countless passages many times simply because I was amazed his ability to construct such poignant and humorous sentences. If you're heavily religious (I know some Christians are fond of saying they're not religious at all. If you are, and that is your stance, then I'm talking SPECIFICALLY to YOU), this book is not for you! You will be offended. This is a book for open-minded people who believe that - if humans are to continually progress - established institutions must be constantly re-examined, and ultimately discarded when they no longer serve their purpose. ...more Boring as hell. Yikes. The book is just a point-by-point smackdown on religion, almost on the level of Family Guy. Which sounds like I'm complimenting the book, but I'm not. This kind of highly sensationalist format is not exactly conducive to any sort of intellectual debate. Hitchens makes many excellent points on how religion is possibly dangerous in today's society, and how it possibly inspires people to kill or hate others.

Hitchens makes many excellent points on how religion is possibly dangerous in today's society, and how it possibly inspires people to kill or hate others. However, his book is marred by two main flaws: 1. that it's poorly organized and steamrolls over logical fallacies on every page; and 2. that it doesn't have the kind of research or statistical evidence you really need if you're going to make a claim like this. Maybe religion poisons a lot of things. Maybe it does poison everything. But does religion also do a lot of good? We don't know. And we don't know, because Mr. Hitchens isn't interested in discussing these kinds of things on a strictly logical or evidence-based level, which is bizarre, because he always seems to be championing logic and evidence. We see him making all kinds of causation fallacies, either/or fallacies, formal logic fallacies. What reasons he give are not backed up rigorously by enough evidence. Evidently, this is a lazy book for lazy people who can't be arsed to find more intellectual responses to common religious objections. (Bear in mind that I am, myself, an atheist, and that I think religion draws up terrible guidelines on ethics/morality. My bias should be /with/ Mr. Hitchens.) ...more<---C>Albert Einstein</---C>", "Title": "God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything"},
