Ugh. This book was a disappointment. I was drawn in by the premise, my mother-in-law having borne twins where one was neurotypical and the other was not (cerebral palsy in our case). As I got into the story, though, its shortcomings became painfully apparent. The characters were shallow and unlikable. In particular I couldn't stand Norah, whose every hackneyed scene - from her flirtation with alcoholism to her tawdry affairs to her rebirth as a liberated entrepreneur - recalled the one Danielle Steele book I read out of desperation during a boring summer at my parents' house. So many times, the plot seemed to be building up to a climax which inevitably fell flat - son Paul's drugged-out ransacking of his father's workroom,<---M> for example</---M>, could've led to his discovering the file on his sister, but instead was resolved with no revelations, just a lame father-son chat and an admonition to clean up the mess - what was the point? As for David and his photography, the title \"Memory Keeper\" would've been more poignant if, say, David had kept his photography a private thing, albums filled with desperately orchestrated scenes of 'happy' family moments that never were; instead, the author chose another Steele-worthy plot of turning him into a detached, semi-pro photo artist with some high-concept obsession with linking anatomy with nature scenes. Whatever. The question of how David pulled off his daughter's faked death is also nagging. Even if he did sign the death certificate himself, how did he swing the service and burial? Should we assume that he simply nipped down to \"Caskets-R-Us\" for a wee box, informed everyone that he stuck her in there, and that no one blinked an eye? The closest thing to a sympathetic, realistic character was Caroline, the nurse who raised <---C>Phoebe</---C>. And speaking of Phoebe, the author seemed to care less about transcending Down Syndrome stereotypes and fleshing her out as a fully-realized character than for using her as a bland abstraction, a screen against which the other characters project their neuroses and complicated life choices. The author is very enamored of setting a scene, right down to the dust motes in the air and the color of people's shoes. She puts too much effort into description and not enough on weaving a compelling plot. Redundancy and trite dialogue are a constant annoyance. Oh, and the whole Rosemary plot at the end? What? David just happens to stumble upon some pregnant homeless chick in his abandoned childhood home who's about Phoebe's age, and after she takes him prisoner and he confesses his precious sins to her, he basically adopts her like a neurotypical stand-in for the broken daughter he gave away? Was that supposed to be some act of redemption - taking in a girl and her baby to atone for the baby he rejected? The whole thing reeks of symbolism, but did anyone else just find this twist not only implausible but creepy? Feh. I struggled to finish this book, but I wouldn't recommend anyone doing the same to themselves. ...more I wanted to like this book. I plowed through the first fifty or so pages in an airport earlier this week and prematurely told several people that it is quite good. It is not. While the writing is okay and the main plot line is fairly interesting: * The author indulges in far too many unreasonably trite, cringe-worthy subplots; * It's positively brimming with baby boomer-centric sentimental claptrap; and * At least a half dozen scenes are completely ruined by the author's obvious naivete about the topi I wanted to like this book.

[this is, mind you, after smoking one joint] Paul picked up the empty pizza box and the thin sheets of waxy paper and carried them out to the garbage can. The air was cool, the world brand new. He was thirsty like a desert, like a ten-mile run, and he carried a half gallon of milk back with him to the living room, drinking straight from the jug and then passing it to Duke. He sat down and played again, more quietly. The guitar notes fell through the air, slowly, gracefully, like winged things. \"You got any more of that stuff?\" he asked. \"Yeah. But this'll cost.\" Need I say more? ...more This book was terrible, not because it was bad, but because it was so good: I couldn't put it down until I finished the final pages at 3 in the morning.

Not a good thing, when your alarm goes off at 5:50 AM. What fascinates me about this book is what it has to say about \"secrets.\" The basic premise: a doctor is forced to deliver his wife's child in the middle of a raging snowstorm. The only complication is that she's actually carrying twins - the first, a healthy beautiful baby boy; the second, a Downs Syndrome baby girl. The year is 1964, when such children are regularly institutionalized - after all, babies like this rarely survive long anyway, and even if they do, their quality of life is marginal at best. As a doctor, David Henry knows his daughters prognosis full well, and rather than force his young wife Norah to deal with such a tragedy, he makes a snap decision to try and protect her from a lifetime of unspeakable grief. His solution: hand the \"defective\" daughter to his nurse to deliver to an institution, while he informs his wife of the tragedy - she delivered twins, but her daughter did not survive childbirth. She is dead. Gone. With that simple little secret, the future is inescapably changed, his doom is sealed - unbeknownst to anyone, the nurse flees into hiding to raise the child as her own. The rest of the book is riveting, because we get to see firsthand the effects of his fall - on his relationship with his wife, his son, and eventually everyone else around him. It's a tragic book (I'm not sure I could read it again), because it's not Hollywood - it's brutally true to the lives that many of us have experienced ourselves. The one ray of hope comes unexpectedly, as David Henry confesses everything - no more secrets - to a young woman with child. In the silence David started talking again, trying to explain at first about the snow and the shock and the scalpel flashing in the harsh light. How he has stood outside himself and watched himself moving in the world. How he had woken up every morning of his life for eithteen years thinking maybe today, maybe this was the day he would put things right. But Phoebe was gone and he couldn't find her, so how could he possibly tell Norah? The secret had worked its way through their marriage, an insidious vine, twisting; she drank too much, and then she began having affairs, that sleazy realtor at the beach, and then the others; he's tried not to notice, to forgive her, for he knew that in some real sense the fault was his. Photo after photo, as if he could stop time or make an image powerful enough to obscure the moment when he had turned and handed his daughter to Caroline Gill. ... He had handed his daughter to Caroline Gill and that act had led him here, years later, to this girl in motion of her own, this girl who had decided yes, a brief moment of release in the back of a car or in the room of a silent house, this girl who had stood up later, adjusting her clothes, with no knowledge of how that moment was already shaping her life. She cut [paper] and listened. Her silence made him free. He talked like a river, like a storm, words rushing through the old house with a force and life he could not stop. At some point he began to weep again, and he could not stop that either. Rosemary made no comment whatsoever. He talked until the words slowed, ebbed, finally ceased. Silence welled. She did not speak. ... \"All right,\" she said [at last]. \"You're free.\" And this single act of honesty produces the deepest intimacy he has ever experienced - it's not sexual, but relational - with a human being who knows the very worst about him and yet who does not reject him for it.

Lots of people watch \"Oprah\" and \"The View\", too. About halfway through the first paragraph I realized, too late to get my fifty cents back, that this is CHICK LIT. Not even goofy, over-the-top fun chick lit, but \"takes itself waaay too serious\" chick lit pretending to be literature. The subtitle of this preposterous premised-book, choked with a mountain of useless detail, should have been \"My Hidden Breastfeeding Agenda, Brought to You By the La Leche League\". She goes on, on, on, and on about \"the milk rising\", and other numerous references to the Joy of Breastfeeding. At least in the first chapters. Then she drops it like a hot potato, busily filling the pages with endless detail about patterns on people's clothing and how the ground looks. Instead of working on character development. Anyway, the plot is just too much: Husband Pretends Handicapped Baby is Born Dead Keeps Big Secret From Wife and Marriage is NEVER THE SAME. Well, duh. The main characters, except Caroline, are wholly unlikeable. The writing is beyond tolerable; my eyes rolled so often they hurt. Edwards clearly has \"The Writer's Guide to Trite\" and \"The Big Book of Cliches\" on her reference shelf. Ugh. Why do rooms always have to be \"small but immaculate\"? Also, while casuarina trees and bougainvillea exist on Aruba, the \"trademark tree\" is the Divi-divi, and cacti are more typical than flowers. Let me guess, Edwards has never been there, right? And note to author: You don't know your ass from a hole in the ground about photography. \"Photography is about secrets\" she writes. Whaaaa???? I thought it was about revelation and discovery. Thanks, Kim, I'll bring my diploma from R.I.T to work tomorrow and shred it in the shredder. And my friends out there, if you ever hear me coin a phrase like \"Memory Keeper\" in reference to me being a photographer, please walk quietly up behind me and smash my skull in with a baseball bat. At least that will be more pleasurable than reading this book. ...more Man I hated this book- the plot had some great potential, but instead you got to witness one scene of frustrated people not knowing how to deal with their emotions after another. Seriously, imagine 60 someodd pages of: wife- \"I'm sad, darling, talk to me\" husband- \"we can't have another baby\" silence...followed by wife being angry and husband yet again being emotionally stunted...ok, fine, I see that it's a result of him giving away their daughter with downs syndrome, but I just wouldn't end! Af Man I hated this book- the plot had some great potential, but instead you got to witness one scene of frustrated people not knowing how to deal with their emotions after another.

After about 10 of these scenes, we get the point. Then we progress to 60 pages of a new hell: son- \"dad, I love music, you don't know who I am!\" father \"son, don't limit yourself to only this option\" once again, fine as a single scene, but we have to endure it again and AGAIN. Then the book adds some completely random characters, has people reflect on life ad nauseum, and basically does nothing to make you care about any of the characters. Also, despite basing an entire story around the mistake of giving up a child because of a mental disability, it gave absolutely no credit to the young girl who has downs syndrome! She's more of a prop than a person, no part of the story is told from her perspective, and asside from the desire to marry her boyfriend, never gets the chance to show the world what she wants and feels. Great job reaffirming stereotypes! My boss loved this book, and some of my coworkers thought it was OK, but obviously I thought it was bad enough to write a barely-cohesive rant rather than a review. This book was a waste of time and paper. ...more I read a bunch of reviews of this book prior to reading it myself, and wasn't sure whether or not I would enjoy it. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I liked this book quite a bit, and here's why: 1. The story was fascinating! What would I have done in that situation? It was fun to imagine myself as Norah, Caroline, David or Paul and determine if my actions would mirror theirs, or if I would have done things differently. 2. The metaphors and imagery that Edwards uses are captivating. For exa I read a bunch of reviews of this book prior to reading it myself, and wasn't sure whether or not I would enjoy it. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I liked this book quite a bit, and here's why: 1. The story was fascinating! What would I have done in that situation? It was fun to imagine myself as Norah, Caroline, David or Paul and determine if my actions would mirror theirs, or if I would have done things differently. 2. The metaphors and imagery that Edwards uses are captivating. For example, she describes \"crocuses shouting\" and \"a wedge of air coming through an open door\". The juxtaposition of physical characteristics ascribed to inanimate objects, and the fusion of opposites added texture to the story. Going along with that, she used the wind as a metaphor-unrest, loneliness, loss, guilt, shame, it spoke a different language to each of the characters and manifested itself in interesting ways. The obsessive compulsive picture taking, the drive to make sense of the world, the bones, the running, the travel-all of these were terrific physical manifestations of inner turmoil, some blatant, others, subtle reminders of the loss. 3. Edwards descriptive abilities made it seem that I was in the room with the characters. She pointed out the pattern of sunlight cascading through the windows, or other mundane details that so many other authors gloss over or ignore because they are too busy telling about events that happen. I realize that in some cases this can be construed as \"dragging, boring, or slow\" but Edwards used such beautiful, interesting language to describe those things, that it made the story come alive for me, and I felt like I was a participant observer, rather than just an observer. 4. One of my personal fascinations is tracking and tracing the pivotal points in people's lives that determine who they really are. Naturally this book was all about how one seemingly right decision affected dozens of lives. How would they have been different if different decision were made? The only really bothersome thing was that nobody triumphed over the loss...no matter how hard they tried...so, is this a cautionary tale to always tell the truth? To not make decisions based on how you think someone will react, but to give them the agency to decide that for themselves? I understand how the outcomes of each of the characters happened, but also would have liked to have seen some triumph and salvation-and perhaps that's what Rosemary and Jack were supposed to be, at least for David. He couldn't fix his own family so he spent his time fixing others-literally and figuratively. And, I guess, ultimately Phoebe and Caroline triumphed...I just don't like to believe that suffering a loss reduces us to throwing our lives to the wind. I want to think that peace and hope can still be found. ...more At first I couldn\u2019t pinpoint exactly why I was not enjoying a book that sounded as though it would be \u2018my kind of book\u2019 in every way, but the more I read and the more I thought about it, the more reasons emerged.

From the beginning of the novel there were little details that bothered me. The plot often felt contrived, as pieces fell together too nicely. Of course life is crazy and there is always the possibility of the little pieces falling in the most peculiar way, but when all of your characters\u2019 lives seem to follow that incredible pattern, it begins to feel ridiculous. Some of the characters themselves also became clich\u00e9s. Perhaps I reached a certain point in the story where I began to look for things that bothered me and therefore found them more readily than other readers. Yet, Norah, the mother of the twins, and her sister, Bree seem to never really develop. Bree is the young, free-loving free-spirit who is thus almost a danger to Norah\u2019s thoughts on life \u2013 and that is what she remains, even when older and diagnosed with cancer (although Norah does come to appreciate her). Norah, whose life unravels for a bit after she thinks her daughter has died, drinks too much and then begins having affairs, and this is who she remains for most of the novel. The characters just seemed too much like a sappy Lifetime movie for me to really take them inside of me and keep with me. I was also very disappointed in the character of Phoebe, the Down\u2019s syndrome daughter given away by her father. She was the driving force of the novel and yet we really never know her other than glimpses through the eyes of Caroline. Paul, her twin brother, is given thoughts but Phoebe\u2019s mind remains a mystery. I understand the difficulty in writing honestly for a character with Down\u2019s but I kept thinking of the autistic narrator in Haddon\u2019s The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time who was so rich and incredible and believable (if you haven\u2019t read this one, please do!!). I just thought that Edwards had a mission in humanizing those who suffer Down\u2019s syndrome; and that she herself undermines her purpose with the complete omission of Phoebe\u2019s voice. I wanted to know this child as a child and not as a sad plot device. In all fairness, however, I have to say that I did love certain passages, as Edwards\u2019 poetic language captured me wholly. In the end, I think that my largest issue with this book was the absolute destruction of this family. I know that what happened at the birth of the babies was tragic and life changing but I felt as though it was a bit contrived that it drove every emotion and interaction afterwards for the remainder of the characters\u2019 lives. Perhaps, for me, it just made their bonds from the beginning suspect as their destruction was made so inevitable by that one tragic mistake. I didn\u2019t believe it and perhaps, because we read to understand others and to change ourselves, I do not want to believe it. ...more This is one of those books that I always see people reading in parks and on the subway, and I just want to shout at them, \"Save yourself!

The author drags you through the book, dangling the moment that the mother finds out about her daughter in front of you.

I began reading this book and fell in love with it. From the beginning, I was very sure that I was going to rate it with five stars. I was intrigued by the premise: It's 1964 and a doctor's wife gives birth to twins. The twins were unexpected (no ultrasounds back then) and so the second baby, a girl with Down's Syndrome, was a shock. In the panic of a moment, the doctor, who had lost his own sister when she was 12 (due to a heart problem), panics and gives his newborn daughter, Phoebe, to his nurse, Caroline. He wants to spare his wife (and himself) the pain of having a child with Down Syndrome who might not live long. Caroline takes the baby to the home, but when she gets there, she realizes she cannot leave the child in such a wretched place and makes a split-second decision to keep her as her own. The author skillfully goes back and forth between the doctor's family, David and Norah Henry (and their son, Paul) and Caroline's life with the girl, Phoebe. I was intrigued. Somewhere, around page 175, I started not liking the book so much. What had been a taut, interesting story, started taking little side trips that I felt tarnished the characters and didn't stay within what I thought the author had set up. But I didn't want to dislike the book for this reason, because I don't expect the author to go where I might go or where I might have liked to see her go. Still, the things that were going on kept nagging at me and making me uneasy in a way that I don't think were intended to make me uneasy. I began to care less and less about the characters, but stayed with the book because it was interesting to see where it went and I had already invested so much time in reading it. There were too many long descriptions of things that didn't matter to me, and no matter how hard I tried, I didn't get to know the characters in the way I thought I should. I am stuck in the middle. In the end, I didn't really care for it all too much, but cannot say that others would not. I give the writer kudos for being so skilled with the English language. I didn't really care about any of the characters very much in the end, if at all, and I think that's what really soured me on this book. This is a hard one for me to judge. If you're at all interested, read it for yourself and see what you think. ...more **SPOILER FREE REVIEW** Reading this book was like an up-hill battle for me.

The plot and synopsis of the story had such excellent promise but along the way the author dropped the ball. It was very difficult to relate or sympathize with Norah Henry, even though she is the one wronged by her husband's rash (but not unfounded) decision to lie about the \"supposed\" death of their mentally defected daughter while keeping her healthy twin brother. Norah's self destructive ways and at times selfish childishness did nothing but annoy me and drive me farther away from her pain. What the author did really well was humanizing Dr. David Henry because reading the back of the novel i thought he was a monster. He was the only character i actually felt was not overly contrived. Phoebe \"the memory keeper\u2019s daughter\" did not have a true voice in the whole novel and that was a poor choice by the author. The major climax and confrontation i was hoping would happen between members of the family never occurred; instead the author decided do something that was shocking but totally unnecessary to the digression of the conflict. So why did i bother giving it 2 stars? Because the one question i wanted answered -- what would possess a man to do such a horrible thing as to not only give away his newborn daughter but then lie about her death? -- was convincingly answered and somewhat understandable. Also the book was beautifully written, and i appreciate any book that can evoke emotion based on simple sentence construction. So, i will look for other books by Kim Edwards -- at the library not the bookstore, for now. ...more Dark Trees in the Heart <+++>The Memory Keeper's Daughter</+++> is a story about a secret--a terrible, life-altering secret running central to the story and in the lives of the characters.

The second, an unexpected daughter, is born with Down's Syndrome. While his wife lay unconscious, David, a doctor who presides over the deliveries because their doctor is unable to get to them due to the snowstorm, makes the decision to tell his wife the second child died. Trying to spare his wife the pain and suffering of having a child who, in his mind would surely die an early death, hands the baby to his nurse, Caroline Gill. He instructs her to take the child to an institution. Caroline finds she cannot leave the baby in this place, moves away and raises \"Phoebe\" on her own. This sets the stage for the terrible secret David must live with and the consequences it has on his family. It's called The Memory Keeper's Daughter because David takes up photography and becomes obsessed with the process. Diving into his hobby, which ultimately brings notoriety to him, he is able to take his mind off his secret, and yet at the same time, focus on the life his lost daughter leads away from him. Photography/snapshots/captured moments are the metaphor for this family and this beautifully written story. There is tremendous detail and one can feel the author using a variety of lenses to provide both wide-angle and tight, intimate views of each scene. Although at times I felt it to be a bit repetitive and wished it were shorter by 50-100 pages, I enjoyed the writing so much, along with the emotion it drew from me, that it didn't matter. I kept turning pages waiting to see how it would all play out. I wasn't disappointed. This book made me ask the question . . . \"what if?\" It also illustrated David's view of the world and Paul's discovery, that \"each person was an isolated universe. Dark trees in the heart, a fistful of bones.\" Very well done. ...more Books like this make me mad. I thought this story was very upper-middle class white suburbia.

Norah wants a kid, she knows nothing about Phoebe, but David constantly tells her that they won't be having any kids soon. (He can't afford sending away another child) The wife and husband's marriage keeps drifting apart, and the fighting starts. Norah feels so ignored by her own husband. She doesn't know why, she doesn't know what happened, and she became so desperate. While David, suffering from his guilt, keeps himself distracted by doing different things, inculding ignoring his wife. It's so painful when he loves her, but all he ever wanted was to spare her the grief, so he did what he could. Meanwhile Paul is growing up in a very tense, unloving marriage and constant fights between his parents, that he even started doing drugs for a while. While David took his baby and wife to their home, Caroline, his nurse, couldn't leave the other baby. She took one deceision, just one deceision that'll change her life forever. She decided taking the baby. The baby that'll keep her happy for as long as she lives. The baby that'll change her life forever. ___________________ The writing style was excellent. Perfect. Hooking. The writing style will suck you in since the very beginning, I felt everything the families felt. From the abnormal, beautiful love between Norah and David before the birth, to the miserable, heart-breaking ending. Every single feeling. And if the writing style is good, and the book made me cry, I can't give it less than four stars. The content was excellent, too. So I can't give it any less than five. I loved it so much. So so much. It went right into my heart. And although I hate to admit it, (view spoiler) [ I'm not pissed at Norah's cheating as much as I was. While I think she should've divorced him, I didn't hate her much after recovering from the book. (hide spoiler) ] The theme was so depressing. Never have I ever read a book as depressing as this one, the ending made me cry so much and it made my throat ache. I literally felt as if there was a potato stuck in my throat. I had to put the book down. I've never put an emotional book down since For One More Day. In fact, I experienced my worst dilemma. Part of me wanted to put the book down to stop the tears and the throat ache. and another part wants to complete so I wouldn't get emotionally detached, I went for the latter. I could only put it down for 15 seconds before picking it up again. I loved the ending so much. And I love the characters, well..excluding Norah, of course. But although what David did was horrible, I loved him so much. I don't even know why I did. (view spoiler) [ That's why, especially, his death made the tears burst. (hide spoiler) ] And I adored Caroline. I don't know why she reminded me of myself but she did. Such a great, brave character. The fierce love she had for Phoebe was admirable. The feelings were excellently protrayed, I can't get over the writing style! And the idea was stupendous this book is truly beautiful. So thank you, Kim Edwards. Thank you for such an excellent writing style. Thanks for this depressing, beautiful book. ...more The book begins in 1964.

A doctor delivers his own wife\u2019s son, and to his own surprise, their son\u2019s twin sister as well. From her physical features, the doctor recognizes the child has Down\u2019s Syndrome and to protect his wife from the grief of having a child die early (common for Down\u2019s children back then) since he and his own family had to deal with the death of his sister when she was young, the doctor hands the child over to his trusted nurse and instructs her to take the child to an institution nearby. The doctor then lies to his wife and tells her their daughter died at childbirth. Instead of delivering the child to the institution, however, the nurse instead runs off with the child to raise it as her own. The rest of the book\u2019s plot hinges on these two fateful decisions: the doctor\u2019s choice to give up his daughter and lie to his wife, and the nurse\u2019s decision to raise the girl as normally as possible. Note to self: if a book\u2019s author is a graduate of the Iowa Writer\u2019s Workshop, put the book down and walk away. This book is as clich\u00e9 as they come \u2013 not just in the plot and the characterizations, but also in the prose. The plot sets itself up for ongoing tension between the characters due to their past decisions, and then allows all of the characters to redeem themselves at the end. The characters are stereotypes: the noble doctor struggling with a past decision motivated by his past grief; the unsatisfied grieving mother who finds solace in other ways; the noble mother who raises a disabled child to prove that everyone deserves equality. It\u2019s like the Iowa Writer\u2019s Workshop deliberately teaches its students to dream up plots worthy of an Oprah\u2019s Book Club Selection. My biggest grievance is that Edwards overwrites every scene. We understand that the characters all have made decisions they regret, and that their pasts inform their present and future actions. We actually don\u2019t need the narrative to spell that out for us in EVERY SINGLE SCENE. We also understand symbolism: early on, there is a scene where the doctor\u2019s wife destroys a wasp nest to prove to herself that she is capable and able to handle things herself without having the doctor protect her and control her \u2013 and yet the author has to point that out to the reader, that the wife felt capable and felt like she didn\u2019t need to be protected any longer. Apparently, Iowa doesn\u2019t teach Subtlety as a course offering. Pass on this, unless you have no sense of discernment and like trite stories. ...more Although the premise was extremely interesting, and there were true moments of brilliance in her characterizations, descriptions, and interactions, this book, more than anything, left me incredibly angry at the author.

The last 50 pages or so are so filled with action that it made me wonder if she got to a certain point and her editor told her she had to finish within a certain number of pages or time. At that same time, those pages are suddenly filled with inconsistencies (David clearly states he burnt all the letters, but somehow we're supposed to believe that he somehow missed some, b/c Paul and Norah find them later -- David was too meticulous for that), surprising coincidences (Caroline just happens to show up -- for NO apparent reason -- just as Norah is \"discovering\" about David chronicled little girl's lives), and events with no motivation (why did Caroline suddenly show up -- saying \"oh I'm glad I caught you\" (my words, not verbatim) when she finds out that Norah's just about to move -- it could have been tied to David's death, to Phoebe moving out or getting married, but instead we're given absolutely NO motivation). Not to mention that we're supposed to believe David died in his 50s from running. Running??? We were never given any reason to believe he had any medical problems, and if anything, the stress in his life had dissipated! Add on the fact that she brings up the same metaphor over and over again (get rid of that damn wall, already, we know it's there! You don't have to point it out!), it was all rather frustrating. The only saving grace was that so many members of my book club felt the same exact way. ...more A beautiful and moving story about a secret kept for 25 years and the effects on the people involved. I really enjoyed this one. I knew the secret world come out eventually, I just had that feeling that it would, but I love how the writer moved each of the characters through the story. This book would have been better if they would have cut out all of the descriptions that were used. Too much \"The wind is blowing, it was cold, etc\". I wanted the author to get to the point already. Other than that a very sad story about the love between a husband and wife and the secrets that are kept between them. Although I enjoyed the book it was just ok because of all the extra that was there. Although I really liked this book, I'm not sure I would openly recommend it to people for fear of them coming back and saying, \"You liked THAT?\" So there, I warned you, and if you decide to read it, you can't blame me!

The story starts in 1964 with a husband, who is a doctor, delivering his own wife's baby late on a snowy night at his clinic, because they couldn't make it to the hospital in the snow storm. After their son is born, his wife gives birth to an unexpected twin- a daughter with Down's syndrome. The husband, in an attempt to spare his wife grief, tells the nurse to take the baby away to an institution. He means to tell his wife what he has done, but instead tells her the second baby died. And it goes from there. It is a very interesting and thought provoking book about the effects of a \"big bad\" secret in a family's life. Of not being allowed to grieve in an open and healthy manner, and this leading to grieving secretly and destructively. Of trying to escape grief leading to sorrow, while facing challenges leading to joy. And of how society's view of grief, of what is socially acceptable, and of Down's syndrome has shifted over the decades. The author wove many levels of detail and imagery into the book, which was a joy to read. I felt she also had an incredible depth of understanding of the emotions people feel in different experiences and times of their life, and what those emotions can motivate them to do. In particular, I really enjoyed how right on her descriptions were of a young grieving mother in a society that does not allow her to fully grieve. Kim Edwards had such tremendous compassion for the characters, that even when I didn't like what they were doing, I felt I understood why they were doing it and what they were trying to accomplish, and so I had to feel some compassion for them as well. That was what I enjoyed about this book. That and the view of how much the culture shifted from 1964 to the late 80's. I didn't enjoy that there is immorality in this book, although she stops short of descriptive sex, for which I am grateful. She does show that the immorality does not bring happiness. Most of all I didn't enjoy watching the family fall apart because they failed to communicate. I found parts of it rather depressing. At times I wanted to put down the book and run and hug my children and husband with tears of joy for the wonderful and happy family that I have. I was disappointed that the author seemed to portray life as having no real hope for a true, deep, meaningful, and loving relationship where communication and honesty exist. I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't been so depressing. I am grateful that at least it ended with a sense of peace and hope for the future. Although I have mixed feelings about the book, I fully admire the talent of the author. The story was depressing, but the author's depth and talent was a joy to read. That is why I gave it four stars, and that is why I am glad to have read this book. ...more Some moments in our lives are crossroads, moments where the course of our lives is shaped.

But the second child has Down\u2019s syndrome. In a moment that changed and defined the life of all five people in the room \u2013 the twins, the parents, and the nurse \u2013 Dr. Henry requests that his nurse take the girl to a home for the mentally retarded. Instead, she takes the child away and raises her as her own. The mother is told only that her daughter was stillborn. Edwards traces the lives of the two families over the next twenty-five years. Dr. Henry sought to shelter his wife and son from grief, but his deep, dark secret winds up alienating him from his family, and the pain he caused may well exceed what they would have otherwise have suffered. His monumentous deception creates a wall upon which other lies are built. As he draws away from his wife, she draws away from him. Their deceptions impact their son, who begins erecting his own walls. Part of David\u2019s withdrawl is accentuated by the gift of a camera that enables him to remove himself from his family\u2019s life. Even when he is present for events and activities, he isolates himself behind the lens. Only years later does he come to realize that much of his life was spent in observation rather than active participation. Meanwhile, as Caroline raises the unwanted child, her perspective completely changes. Instead of waiting to be loved, she learns to find fulfillment in loving. After several years, she recognizes that she was not a passive victim but an active accomplice in the deception. The Memory Keeper\u2019s Daughter is a tale of deception and treachery, but it is also a story of walls and barriers. Over and over again, David had the opportunity and even the desire to confess and come clean, and yet he never does. Instead, he remains silent, and his silence is frequently misinterpreted, driving another wedge between himself and those he loves. Although few of us deceive to such magnitude, the story manages to illustrate the price of deception of all sizes. Edwards has managed to weave a convincing story of tragedy, fully drawing the reader into her tale. ...more Beautiful writing, horrible story telling - I bought this book based on the back cover snapshot.

I was expecting to love the wife and feel emotionally connected to her throughout the book since she has been deceived, grieving for a dead daughter that did not really die. But instead, she turns out to be a self-centered, promiscuous whore which makes no sense to me whatsoever. There was nothing \"driving\" her to adultery. The poor excuse of feeling alienated or growing apart emotionally from her husband just doesn't cut it for me. The son was just not interesting to me. He was also too weak, again with no strong reason or explanation. Seriously, does a father working too many hours really cause his son to end up that disconnected? And his wife to end up a self-righteous adulterer? Throughout the book, neither the wife nor the son has any idea that their daughter/sister is still alive and being raised by the father's former nurse so this gives them no real excuse to behave the way they did... Also, the author tries to express that the father/husband spends too much time working and not with the family, YET they go on vacation TOGETHER, and as soon as he is out of sight, the wife strips and goes inside the neighbor's bungalow to get her freak on...WHY?

Most of the books I waste my time reading are plot-filled page-turners, in which the author has a tremendous story that pours out through the pages, and you get just a little comprehension of what makes the characters tick as they progress through the action, but in the end how well do we really know Mary Denunzio or Stephanie Plum or even Jack Ryan? Read this novel, however, and you really, really get to know Dr. David Henry McAllister; his wife, Nora; his son, Paul; his nurse, Caroline Gill \u2013 you come to know them because the book is told in the third person from their respective points of view, with the linear plot unfolding as you see the action sequentially through their biased eyes. There is very little real action in this novel, however, although it springs from a single impossible act. Taking his pregnant wife to the hospital to give birth, David finds that he cannot get to the hospital because of the raging snowstorm, so he takes her to his own little clinic where he and his nurse, who is secretly in love with him, deliver the baby, a perfectly healthy boy, and then find that there is a twin sister, who has unmistakable symptoms of Down\u2019s Syndrome. Thinking to protect his beloved wife from the problems of having to live with this, he tells his nurse to take the baby girl to an institution, which was actually quite the common thing in those days, and he tells his wife that their baby daughter died at childbirth. From that point on, we simply see these people living their lives, irretrievably bound together by a secret that only a few of them know. Caroline instead takes the baby to another city and raises her as her own child, while Norah and Paul\u2019s lives become poisoned by thinking about the daughter and sister they thought was lost, and David wanders into a hell of his own making as the members of his family become alienated, while at the same time we learn more about his past and come to an understanding of what drove him to do this. Kim Edwards is a marvelous story-teller. Time after time, as I read her biting description of what it is like to love and to lose that love, I said: \u201cThat\u2019s my life she is writing.\u201d She understands fully how we all get caught up in our own imaginings so that we cannot be open to the people we love, even when we see that very condition driving them away. One of her messages, surely, is that change is always with us, and we have to live with that change and understand it, even through our human nature forces us to try to contain it and to keep things the way they used to be. Nora gives David a camera as a gift, and he gradually becomes a famous photographer, but the results of his overwhelming concentration on his new hobby only further forces his family apart, while they all keep looking back to the early feelings and memories of their relationships and try to comprehend what has happened to make them drift apart. We see the same patterns repeating over and over, not only in David and Norah\u2019s lives but also with Caroline and her husband, then with Paul and his lover. One of the things that Kim Edwards is astonishingly good at is compressing the story. There is sex in these peoples\u2019 lives, but it all takes place off stage, between chapters or between paragraphs, because it is not important in this story -- in vivid contrast to the novel I wrote about last night, for which sex was the very basis of the book. Similarly, one of the main characters dies offstage, between chapters, as if the passing is merely a minor incident, only faintly related to the plot. I cried three times reading this book, so filled with emotion that at one point I had to put it down and go read something else. Today, however, I had to take my granddaughter to the dentist and then to her swimming class, and the book conveniently was rediscovered under a pile of papers while I was cleaning up my office last night, so it was ready to hand when I had time to spend on it \u2026 with the inevitable result that I again got all caught up in the story and came home from a social event this evening and had to sit down and finish it. Definitely five stars; definitely a book to go back and read again some time. ...more It's a depressing book.

The subject matter of the book is heart-rending. The characters have all been portrayed well. For a first novel, the author has definitely done well. But the narrative style leaves much to desire. David is THE memory keeper so it is only expected that we would get glimpses into his past, but the author overdoes it at times. And the middle of the book is repetitive with the same descriptions of Norah's anguish and David's, again, memory . I don't have problems with books where 'nothing' happens, but I do have a thing against books where the actions are limited to the beginning and the end. And this book definitely does that. In all, it was a good one time read. A good 3.5. ...more I distrust my bookclub's groupthink now. Last month's book was 'The Alchemist' and now this!

This is an actual quote from the book: \"There was tension beneath David's voice like rocks in white water\" I don't know what that means either, folks. I took an instant dislike to Norah even though I think she's supposed to be a sympathetic character in the story. She does not seem to adequately question her husband's pretty sketchy handling of her daughter's death, she seems pretty concerned with her weight for someone who's just given birth and lost a child. There's a redeeming moment for her when she puts on some beige flats and the author notes \"her feet, at least, were slim\". BECAUSE OF COURSE THIS IS A COMPLETELY LEGITIMATE AND LIKELY CONCERN RIGHT NOW. Norah also doesn't like feeling like a mammal, guys. Yeah. So, Bree, her sister who is all cool and liberal and kooky in all kinds of ways because she thinks breast-feeding is natural and Norah, conversely, doesn't like the idea of being a mammal - it makes her blush. Bree is also annoying because she says, and I quote, 'one of the unsung benefits of breast-feeding is that the weight just falls off you'. There's a lot of obsession with weight in this novel. When the lives of the characters are in these pretty upsetting and tragic situations, the women continue to be preoccupied with how thin they look. Sure, you could argue that this is a trope because it's so often true but it felt like a very unnatural reaction to the devastating circumstances they were facing. Apart from the unlikeable characters, which is not usually an issue for me, I found the plot to be impossible. How on earth did he get away with a burial but no body? I mean, sure, you could definitely fake a death certificate but there's a chain of command that the author blatantly ignores. She sacrifices authenticity and a rational plot for sensationalist drama which is unfortunate because the premise for this novel is quite interesting. Here is another annoying quote: '\"I know\" she said because it was 1964 and he was her husband and she had always deferred to him completely\". OK, so, first of all, not a huge fan of Norah already so this is making me want to tear my hair from off of my head reading this. And second of all, 1964 . 1964! The birth of second-wave feminism was frickin' setting the world on fire during this time. Wait, Betty Friedan who? Gloria Steinhem who? Erica Jong who? Germaine Greer who? Gaaaah... The treatment of Phoebe, the character with Down Syndrome is completely undernourished and underdeveloped. Pheobe exists purely for the neurotypical characters' to reflect on and for them to develop themselves based around her. She is completely ornamental. The author completely missed the chance to create an interesting character from Phoebe, with her own ideas and morals and thoughts about the world. At the end, the son Paul asks \"What if she'd been born without Down's?\" (he literally says 'down's) This is a weak, self-important and pretentious novel. I don't like to post negative reviews a lot but I have to be brash and honest about this one. Avoid like the plague unless you enjoy bad metaphors. This book had a lukewarm reception within my bookclub. Some found it thought-provoking, some called it a 'page-turner' but the overall consensus was that it was nothing tremendous.

This author does not have the experience or excellence to tackle all those topics well. The book begins with the birth of twins. THe father is an MD and a snowstorm puts him in a situation of delivering his own children. One child is fine, the other he diagnoses immediately as having Downs (I think it harder to diagnose than was presented). He immediately decides to get rid of the Down's child by telling the nurse to take it to an insitution. His rationale is that he is protecting his wife who is a perfectionist. I was touched by the theme of giving away the baby and keeping it secret - if he had just stayed with this theme. THere were a number of the scenes about loss that were well done. I felt that the author must have first hand knowledge of Down's children and also of loss. I also liked the portrayal of the sister sister bond - so different but still so in sync. However, there were so many extraneous and unsupportable diversions and unnecessary, irritating, distracting characters with no purpose. There is also much that verges on hokey - the main character it turns out \"lost\" his last name in a mix up while applying for college. Overall, skip this book.

What happens to the nurse? Why, she lives (almost) happily-ever-after. Her daughter does well, living a life her true father never thought possible.

I felt bad for the son because he never got to know his sister & he wasn't treated very well by his parents. I didn't like David's decision but felt sorry for him at the end. There were just too many secrets, too many times when things should have been spoken & weren't. And, I can't believe that something like this has happened in America's history. It's so awful to think that this part of the story is true. ...more I guess the book was supposed to be poignant and touching, something at which it failed miserably.

An incredibly frustrating book! 2 stars ...more This book was terrible. I can't quite figure out why it's on the NYT best seller list. The story seemed promising: A doctor delivers his own twins during a freak spring snow storm in 1964. The first twin is born perfectly healthy, the second has Down's syndrome. In a split second decision, the doctor sends the baby away and tells his wife that she died at birth. Sounds like the making of a good story. Unfortunately, the book was boring, with nothing much happening in the vast majority of it. Com This book was terrible. I can't quite figure out why it's on the NYT best seller list. The story seemed promising: A doctor delivers his own twins during a freak spring snow storm in 1964. The first twin is born perfectly healthy, the second has Down's syndrome. In a split second decision, the doctor sends the baby away and tells his wife that she died at birth. Sounds like the making of a good story. Unfortunately, the book was boring, with nothing much happening in the vast majority of it. Compound boringness with a main character who isn't at all sympathetic (he gave away his own daughter after all) and you have a deadly combination. I kept reading, however, because I wanted to see how the author resolved this dilemma. SPOILER ALERT! The resolution was completely frustrating for me. After 24 years, the woman who raised the twin with Down's syndrome suddenly shows up at the mother's house to tell her that her daughter is really alive. There is no explanation as to why -- after hiding the daughter for more than two decades and refusing to answer the doctor's request to meet his daughter -- she finally steps forward. No reason is given. Then there is the matter of a pregnant teenage girl who shows up in the doctor's life and becomes sort of a replacement for the \"lost\" daughter. When the doctor dies suddenly, the girl is never mentioned again. I found it frustrating because she becomes an important character in the story, but you never learn how she reacts to his death. Finally, the mother who pines for her \"dead\" daughter for 24 years and battles through depression and a failed marriage, finds out about this ultimate betrayal and instead of trying to bridge the lost years to get to know her daughter, gets remarried and moves to France. How plausible is that??? The defining moment in her life is that she never knew the daughter she lost in childbirth, and when she is given this miraculous gift, she continues on with her life as planned??? Oh wait, the Down's syndrome girl is going to visit her in France. Oh, well that solves everything! (Note the heavy sarcasm here.) I just didn't believe it. With 300 pages of nothing much happening, I would have liked more than 20 pages dedicated to the reunion of a daughter, whose loss tore a family apart. One final petty note: In about five instances, the author compares various objects to \"dust motes.\" For crying out loud, can't the author think of something original for her similes and metaphors? Really, if I want dust motes, I'll do some housework! ...more This was a fairly emotional read, and I found myself sympathising with the characters at some points, and hating them at others. I think the only character I actually liked the whole way through was Al. The other characters ranged from not liking them at all (Paul), to mostly sympathising, but not completely (Caroline). I think the way that children with Down's Syndrome were treated in 1964 was scandalous. I was appalled at how they were automatically thought less of and sent to an institution.

I think the way that children with Down's Syndrome were treated in 1964 was scandalous. I was appalled at how they were automatically thought less of and sent to an institution. I grew up in the same class as a boy with Down's Syndrome, and although he was slower than the rest of us at learning (he'd been held back a year at school) he was one of the nicest people you could meet. I therefore found they way Phoebe was treated quite upsetting. I think that the writer did a very good job of putting across just how difficult it was to fight for the rights of a child with Down's Syndrome in those days. I tried hard to like David, I really did, but after telling his wife initially that their daughter had died, he had lots of opportunities to come clean and redeem himself but he never did. I just couldn't forgive him for that. I loved the descriptive style of the author's writing. I could imagine everything down to the smallest details and almost felt like I was there. Usually I'm not a fan of this much description, however I felt it worked really well in this book. The characterisation in the book was wonderful. Whilst I may not have sympathised or liked all of the characters, they were all built up really well, so that you could at least understand them and their motives. They were by no means flat - in fact quite the opposite. David especially is a very complex character, who is constantly evolving throughout the book. I liked how the story followed both sides separately... I felt that the interjection of Caroline and Phoebe's story gave a happier tone to an otherwise fairly depressing depiction of the Henry's journey. I felt that the story was a fair assessment of what the consequences of such a huge lie can mean to all of the people involved. I enjoyed this book, and couldn't put it down, although I did feel that some of it was a little too coincidental and parts didn't make sense. Also Norah's story dragged on a bit too much for my liking. These are the reasons why it only has 4 stars. ...more For her first novel (although Kim Edwards was not new to the literary scene), Edwards deserves high praise for her ability to create characters that are complex, sympathetic, and believable.

The Memory Keeper\u2019s Daughter begins in 1964. David Henry, an orthopedic surgeon, is forced to deliver his wife Norah\u2019s baby with the assistance of his nurse Carolyn because a blizzard has prevented David from making it to the office. But it turns out that Norah is carrying twins. Paul, healthy, enters the world first. When Phoebe follows, David immediately realizes that she has Down\u2019s syndrome. Not only is it 1964 when many Down syndrome babies were institutionalized, but David\u2019s sister died when she was twelve, of a heart defect. His mother never recovered, and David has never told anyone about this part of his past. To save Norah heartache, David decides to tell his wife that the twin girl died. He asks Carolyn to take the baby to an institution. A split-second decision by David; and Carolyn\u2019s subsequent decision to run away, to raise the child herself, sets the chain of events that spans the next quarter of a century. The novel alternates between the experiences of both families, and the effect David\u2019s decision has on all their lives. The Memory Keeper refers to the camera Norah buys for David for their anniversary, and the daughter, of course, is Phoebe. Norah\u2019s gift is an attempt to dispel stress, to give David a hobby, but it backfires. David becomes obsessed with photography. The tension in the Henry household grows as the years pass by, until David and Norah grow apart. Meanwhile, Paul seethes with anger he doesn\u2019t really understand, believing it stems from father\u2019s disapproval of his wish to make music his career. Meanwhile Carolyn struggles to give Phoebe the opportunity to become a successful, happy member of society. She wages a tremendous fight against the societal prejudices of the day. That Kim Edwards chose to structure the novel \u2013 1964; 1965; 1970; 1977; 1982; 1988; and finally, 1989 \u2013 meant that, especially during the middle, she didn\u2019t focus on the precise details of daily life as she did in the beginning and end sections. Perhaps it was just me, but I felt disconcerted when I turned pages, discovering that such a large gap in time had occurred, in particular, from 1977 through to 1988. One of Edward\u2019s strengths, though, (and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in feeling this), is that she characterized David in such a way, that I felt empathy for him, despite his deception, despite the distance he placed between his wife, his son, and the daughter he gave away. I felt that his struggle to live with himself was akin to suffering from an internal hemorrhage of the heart, over and over again. As a doctor, \u201cDo no harm\u201d, is embedded in his character; and he meant well when he did, indeed, do harm to those he truly loved. I thought he deserved forgiveness. Other readers may disagree. This story begins with a decision made by a man with many secrets. His decision becomes the catalyst to move the characters through feelings of loss, regret, love, hope \u2013 and redemption. It is a deeply emotional, powerfully written novel, one I hadn\u2019t been sure I\u2019d be able to get into at the start, but that by the end I had embraced. ...more", "Title": "The Memory Keeper's Daughter"},
