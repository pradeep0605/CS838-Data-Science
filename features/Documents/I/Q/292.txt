(view spoiler) [A voice in my head: Come on. You can't post that on Goodreads. Me: *glares* Why not? A voice in my head (aka VH): Please, don't. You will ruin your reputation. Me: *weary* Not that again. VH: Well, it's true. You can't post that. It's just not okay. Do you have any idea how popular this book is? Hint : YOU CAN'T EVEN GUESS. Me: Why should I care? Maybe some people think like me. VH: You don't understand. It's not just random book that you can critize like you do all the time and just get away with it. This is THE FAULT IN OUR STARS. And it's <---A>John Green</---A> . Believe me, you do NOT want to get in the way of those crazy fans, nerdfighters or whatever it is they call themselves. Me: Really, what the fuck do I care? I want to give this 3 stars. It's not like I'm giving it 1 star or something. VH: But why would you even do that in the first place? EVERYONE, and I do mean EVERYONE in your friend list gave it 5 stars. And they used so many sobbing gifs! Really, it made me cry a little just looking at them. Me: *stares* VH: It won the Goodreads award for best YA! Me: So? Fifty Shades won Best Romance. VH: It's got one of the highest general ratings for a book on Goodreads! Me: Nobody but the Goodreads community actually cares. And wait. I'm not even sure the Goodreads community actually cares. I know I don't. VH: You're such a cold-hearted bitch. Why would you give it only 3 stars anyway? Don't you have a heart? And why 3 stars? I know you really loved the book, deep down! Me: I didn't. I mean,<---M> I liked it</---M>, it was okay... but I didn't love it. It's... I mean... Oh, fuck it. It's overrated. There! I said it. Sue me. VH: *seethes* You did NOT just say that. Me : I did. Because it is! Come on, did you read the dialogues in this? Can we talk about the dialogues? I want to talk about the dialogues. VH: *crosses arms* Go ahead. I want examples. Me: Fine. I'll start with the popular quotes. You know what I'm talking about. The quotes which are totally overrated and everyone loves them and they create pics and stuff when really, if you think about the quote in itself.. Well, you realize that it just, you know, sucks. VH: *mumbles* How 'bout: you suck? Me: What was that? Actually, forget it, I don't give a shit. Listen to this! \u201cMy thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.\u201d VH: So? It's beautiful. Me: Well...*tries really hard to refrain from laughing* I mean... Seriously? Like... *fails miserably* HAHAHAHA how more pretentious can you get? Comparing your thoughts to stars? REALLY? VH: You're so shallow. Some of us have deep thoughts, you know. Like, thoughts so deep they actually deserve to be compared to the firmament. I don't even want to explain to you how poetic this is, because I'd waste my time. Me: Save yourself the effort, I don't mind. And I've got another example. Probably my favorite. \"That's the thing about pain. It demands to be felt.\" VH: What now? You're gonna say that it's so pretentious it made you cry? Me: Precisely. *nods wisely* Because that's the thing about tears. They demand to be wet. Or that's the thing about food. It demands to be eaten. Or that's the thing about... VH: SHUT UP, I get it! There's no discussion with you. How am I supposed to discuss with someone who's got the intellectual depth of an empty oyster? Me: But come on, I'm not finished yet. What about Augustus and his unlit cigarette? \u201cThey don\u2019t kill you unless you light them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never lit one. It\u2019s a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don\u2019t give it the power to do its killing.\u201d Me: Is this supposed to be smart? This is pathetic. It's terrible, it's not funny, and it's not deep. VH: *hisses* It's a metaphor! Me: I know! \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor,\u201d I said, dubious. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor,\u201d he said. \u201cYou choose your behaviors based on their metaphorical resonances...\u201d I said. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in metaphor, Hazel Grace.\u201d Me: Can you say metaphor again? Say metaphor one more time! Go ahead, say it, I think John Green hasn't totally forced it down my throat yet! *hysterical yelling* LET'S SAY IT AGAIN! Metaphor! Everything is a METAPHOR ! VH: What's your point, you freak? Me: My point is, the dialogues are horrible. It made my eyes burn. It's pretentious and unbelievable, AND besides, you can totally see that John Green loves the characters. VH: What author doesn't like the characters of their own book? Me: It's not the same! With John Green... It's like he adores himself. I bet you anything he re-reads his own books. Just to see exactly how awesome they are. VH: What? You don't know that. You cannot possibly say that. How dare you talk about him like you know him. Me: You know, in the audio version of <+++>The Fault in Our Stars</+++>, at the end, there's an interview with him. And he explicitly says that he just LOVES listening to the audio versions of his books. So there. VH: What? No. You're wrong. He doesn't mean, like, he loves it when someone reads him his own books. That's not what he meant AT ALL. It's a misunderstanding. What he meant was, he loves listening to the.. the.. reading lady . Because she has such a sweet voice and everything. Me: Are you kidding me? He's in love with himself! Augustus is just an hologram. An empty shell. Seriously, his monologues are laughable. I couldn't even focus. I kept thinking of John Green while reading. Because Augustus is just SO witty, so smart, so perfect. *cough cough* wish fulfillment hello . VH: I am so not convinced. Me: There's this whole repetition thing, too. I cannot believe how all the characters of his books look alike. How come it works every SINGLE time? How many books are out there, now? 4? 5? More, surely. It's always the SAME THING. Geeky and nerdy narrator, geekier and nerdier sidekick, mysterious but unbelievable girl, random plot that doesn't even make sense, road trip. Come the fuck on. You know what? The fact that people aren't getting tired of him and his stupid same characters is the real question. VH: But this book is unique. The way it deals with cancer and death... It's so beautiful. You cannot possibly say it isn't. Me: That's what disturbed me the most. Look. What I want to say is, not every death is glorious. Not every death is epic and not every death will glow like a star in the eternal twilight sky. Most of the time, deaths are random, plain, and the world is cold and uncaring, and that's how it is. And that's what's terrible. You don't need to be a hero, you don't need to defy death the way Augustus pretends to, you don't need to lose yourself in unbelievable speeches to have people cry over your death. The book is just TOO much. VH: You know, about them being unbelievable when they talk? You seem to forget something. Augustus and Hazel ARE different. They're unique, so they talk different. That's what it's all about. Me: They're not different, they don't exist. They can't exist. Honestly? I don't think this was a good tribute to the kids who are really sick. Because no one talks like that, NO ONE, and I feel like now there's this messed-up hierarchy between the sick kids who are sort of smart ass and those who aren't. And I refuse that. I can't accept that. Being ironic, jaded, detached and all metaphorical over the disease is a luxury that genuinely sick teenagers cannot afford. So fuck this. And I'd rather kneel before a kid who has cancer and who doesn't know what a metaphor is than shed a tear over one of Augustus's stupid monologues. VH: You liar, I know you cried while you read the book. You were a sobbing mess. Me: I wasn't. I was a sobbing mess at the end of Before I Die . And oh my God, I couldn't even speak after I finished A Monster Calls because I was crying so hard. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl had me in tears, too. These are all gorgeous books that deal with cancer. And I cried like a bitch every single time, and they broke my heart. But this? I didn't cry. VH: You did, and you know it. Especially at THIS special moment. Me: *looks away* I don't know what you're talking about. VH : You cried when Hazel asked her mom if she would still be a mom after her death. Me: Fine, okay. I cried. I know. Okay? I know. But look. That's precisely the point. That's what I call emotional blackmail. Because I DARE YOU not to cry over that discussion. Because it's a universal fear! Whether you're a mom, or a daughter, or both, if you have a sister even, you must have thought about that already and told yourself : Okay, if I die, or if she dies. Who will I be? If my sister dies and I'm asked whether I have a sibling, what should I say? Am I still a sister because she existed, once? Or if you have a child, and then one day your baby dies. What happens then? Are you still a parent? Are you still a parent because once, you used to be a parent, and because there's a room upstairs that used to be your child's? I dare you to think about it and not end up crying. I took it as a betrayal from John Green because I feel like he didn't play fair. OF COURSE talking about a child's death in this peculiar way will make the reader cry! But it's so easy. It doesn't require any talent. Just ask anyone to talk about that and they'll be tearing up in 5 seconds! Do you understand what I'm trying to say? I feel like he was like, \"I'm gonna make them cry.\" and all the while I was reading I swear I could hear him: \"ARE YOU SAD YET? ARE YOU HEARTBROKEN YET? DO YOU SEE HOW INCREDIBLY UPSETTING MY STORY IS? I KNOW, RIGHT. I AMAZE MYSELF SOMETIMES.\" VH: But-- Me: No, look. Writing like that, it's not incredible, it's not magical and it's not valuable. It's playing with people's weaknesses. It's manipulating people into crying. And I can't respect him with that the way I respect people who manage to make me cry without using such poor plot devices. Like in, Me and Earl and The Dying Girl . There's a cancer book that really took me by surprise. Because, Rachel, the sick girl, is everything but admirable. She's young, a bit shallow, nice, shy, plain, normal, really. And her neighbor who befriends her, he doesn't fall in love with her. And her death won't be remembered like something that scarred humanity, because it didn't. Ultimately, it didn't even matter at all. And I could relate more easily to that, to the meaningless dimension of her death, to the emptiness of it all, more than I could ever relate to the ridiculous speeches of Augustus (and Hazel's too, for that matter). Because you know what bothered me, too? They're indistinct. VH: That's because they're soul mates. That's the whole point of the book. They found themselves in each other. Me: It doesn't work to say they're soul mates. Look, I read the book almost a year ago, I think. And this: \u201cI\u2019m in love with you, and I\u2019m not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I\u2019m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we\u2019re all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we\u2019ll ever have, and I am in love with you.\u201d Me: This is beautiful, granted. It's also unrealistic that a teenager would ever say that, let alone improvize it, but whatever, it's pretty. But the thing is, I am completely unable to say whether it's Augustus or Hazel who says that. I don't know. I have no idea. I try to recognize the style, but I can't tell, BECAUSE THEY TALK EXACTLY THE SAME. VH: ... Me: So yeah. I didn't love the book, and I am not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things; I didn't love the book, and I know this review might be just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed to another John Green book about an unbelievable loser and his even more loser sidekick loving an unbelievable teenage girl, and that there will come a day when maybe he will change his writing formula, and maybe that'll come when the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, but then it'll be too late, so who cares? I didn't love this book. VH: *suspiciously silent* Me: Are we done? VH: FINE. Ugh. Okay. *Waves white flag* I surrender. Me: Yes! *clicks \"save review\"* (hide spoiler) ] [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more Update (25/06/2014)- Since I've been receiving a lot of cyber bullies and hate messages, I\u2019m going to clarify few things. -Firstly, this is a negative review of the book and it has got a lot of potential to infuriate the fans. If you think that your opinion is the only opinion that exists on earth and that no one should dislike your favourite book, then I would suggest you to avoid this review. -Secondly, This is my review and I have the freedom to analyse and criticise this book as I wish to wit Update (25/06/2014)- Since I've been receiving a lot of cyber bullies and hate messages, I\u2019m going to clarify few things. -Firstly, this is a negative review of the book and it has got a lot of potential to infuriate the fans. If you think that your opinion is the only opinion that exists on earth and that no one should dislike your favourite book, then I would suggest you to avoid this review. -Secondly, This is my review and I have the freedom to analyse and criticise this book as I wish to without being told by others how I\u2019m supposed to criticise it. I have the freedom to have my own thoughts and to express them in whatever way I want to and I don\u2019t appreciate fans shoving their opinions down my throats, I\u2019m not here to cater the needs of TFIOS fandom. -Thirdly, stop harassing me . Why can't you get it through your thick skulls that everyone has different opinions, they\u2019re going to interpret books differently from you and stop being selfish to think that just because you loved a book that means the whole world should love it. This world is full of people with differing opinions, differing thoughts and differing likes and differing dislikes, learn to respect them even if you don\u2019t agree with what they have to say about your favourite books. Just because you love a particular book that I hate doesn't make you a good person and me a bad person, It simply shows that people like different things. Every reader has the freedom to dissect and critically analyse any book and write their thoughts on it in their own review space without the fear of anyone (or fans bossing them into writing what the fandom wants). Critically analysing books and criticising problematic aspects of any reading material prevents people from being passive readers. Shakespeare and J.K Rowling too have their own share of critics then what makes Green\u2019s book flawless that it\u2019s not allowed to be criticised? Honestly, this book is nowhere as good as the works of those two geniuses. Stop thinking that criticising this book is sacrilegious. -Fourthly, stop cyber bullying and trolling me. Your hate messages and death threats will show much more of your personality than your love for this book. Remember, every time you comment any bullshit here, you\u2019re giving your own fandom a bad name and my review more popularity. Also, your hate messages aren't going to put me down. I\u2019m a strong girl and I\u2019m always going to stand up for what I believe in come hell or high water. I don't fear anyone and no one can ever force me to follow their orders like a puppet especially not a fandom where most of the fans are immature cyber bullies who can\u2019t respect other\u2019s opinions. Also, I've caught fans making fake accounts to troll my review, this shows me that they are big cowards who hide their faces and send me spiteful comments. -Lastly, I\u2019m NOT shaming anyone for loving this book. You can love whatever you want to and believe in whomever you want to. I have no problem with people who genuinely love this book; I have problems with those who think readers should not have the rights to express their dislike for any book, I have problems with those who approve of and participate in cyber bullying reviewers who write negative reviews on their favourite books, I have problems with those who refuse to acknowledge the fact that their favourite books can have flaws and not everyone\u2019s going to love them, I have problems with those who come here to shove their opinions down my throat. Do you find anyone who hated this book shoving their opinions in comments of positive reviews? Then what makes you think that you have the rights to troll negative reviews? Alright, now let's begin with the review. **WARNING- MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD** Disclaimer- I'll repeat once more, if you cannot handle differing opinions or reviewers criticising your favourite book, please leave immediately . EXPECTATION- REALITY- I\u2019ve re-written this review because my previous one contained my angry rant and most of my points were incoherent. So I happily bought the hardcover of The Fault in our stars back in December 2012 after seeing the high average GR ratings and raving reviews saying how beautiful, life-changing, thought-provoking and blah blah it is. Surprisingly, this book was so special that it became the first book that I slammed on the wall twice after reading it. It didn\u2019t only disappoint me but also angered me. I'm surprised to find that harsh critics are swallowing up this trash and calling it a masterpiece. Ugh! I\u2019m going to make a list of everything I hate about this book that earned it the topmost place on my list of Worst books ever. The characters- Hazel and Augustus are the flattest cardboard cut-outs I have ever seen in any book. Both of them were like 60-years-old stuck in some teenager's bodies making them very boring and unlikeable. Hazel was such an annoying, stupid and pretentious Mary Sue that I wanted to punch her right in the face. One great example of her stupidity- \u201dWhy are breakfast foods breakfast foods...Like, why don\u2019t we have curry for breakfast?\u201d \"A nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is, at best, awkward and, at worst, a form of assault. But a hot boy . . . well.\" Augustus and Hazel have the same boring, pretentious, know-it-all and indistinguishable personality. Hazel is the female version of Augustus (no, I\u2019m not going to call him affectionately with Gus) and he is the male version of Hazel. These two characters meld together and have no depth at all. I couldn\u2019t connect with them, I felt no pain and sympathy for them and they annoyed me so much that I wanted to stab them. Romance- It fell from the sky. Seriously, I don\u2019t get what\u2019s so \u201cbeautiful\u201d about the relationship between them. They both fall in love within seconds just after laying eyes on each other ~love at first sight~ . The romance is undeveloped and it comes from nowhere. I was baffled when Hazel accepted to go to Augustus's house just minutes after meeting him. WHAT THE HELL? How stupid can you be? You fall for a guy's words whom you met just few minutes ago and agree to go to his house! What if he were a murderer or rapist? Not to mention that the kissing scene in Anne Frank's house was so effing disgusting. Anne Frank's house is considered to be a place of remembrance, a place where 2 families hid during the dark days of Holocaust. If anyone makes out at such a revered site, they would be kicked out regardless of who or what they are. People present around will be disgusted, they won't stand and watch much less clap for the \"lovely\" couple. Writing- Cheesy. Emotionless. Ambiguous. Brain-cell burning. Want to hear some favourite quotes of mine? Here they are- \u201cMy thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.\u201d ...Why compare your thoughts to stars and constellations? *sighs* \"Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.\" \"That's the thing about pain. It demands to be felt.\" ...Yeah, that\u2019s the thing about chocolate, it demands to be eaten. \u201cI believe the universe wants to be noticed. I think the universe is improbably biased toward the consciousness, that it rewards intelligence in part because the universe enjoys its elegance being observed. And who am I, living in the middle of history, to tell the universe that it-or my observation of it-is temporary?\u201d ... Umm\u2026.What?! \u201dI'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.\u201d (view spoiler) [ (hide spoiler) ] \u201cThere will come a time when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows that\u2019s what everyone else does.\u201d Me- There were senseless dialogues, brain-cell burning metaphors and words thrown around in the book from the dictionary. I\u2019ll stop here because just thinking about them gives me an awful migraine. And you know what? Teenagers living in the 21st century DON'T speak like that. No teen can spontaneously come up with long monologues within seconds. Also, genuinely sick teenagers don\u2019t have the luxury to be so witty and clever every single time. One thing I don't buy is that teens with cancer suddenly become magically wise. They become terrified, confused, depressed and angry. They DON\u2019T magically gain great insight in life and go around puking long monologues about the meaning of life. This book made me roll my eyes in disgust. (UPDATE- In response to gazillion questions and arguments I've been getting on the paragraphs above, I have written a detailed explanation below)*** Plot- Predictable. Boring. Uninspiring. Put me to sleep. I had to plough through the whole book. Cancer is hard, it's painful but this book didn\u2019t show me that. I couldn\u2019t feel Hazel and Augustus\u2019 struggle against it. I couldn\u2019t feel their pain. TFioS is nothing but a cheesy romance novel. Me throughout the book- I knew that someone would die. Augustus's death wasn't powerful enough, if Green would've shown his death I would've understood why the world cried a whole bucket over him. \"He died eight days after his prefuneral\" WHAT THE HELL?? Green tried to make his death sound LIKE HE WENT TO A PARTY LAST WEEK!!! Ok, so this book made you cry, right? If a book makes you cry it automatically doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a masterpiece. I can understand that you must\u2019ve felt sad and sympathetic for the characters and must\u2019ve cried but considering that this novel is sad and it made you cry doesn\u2019t make it an awesome, life-changing and beautiful story. I cried after reading Allegiant for days but I hated that book with burning passion, it was one of the worst books I ever read. The undeserved hype and comparison with The Book Thief - I don't understand why people compare The Fault in our stars to The Book Thief by Markus Zusak. Zusak is a genius; he handles his themes -death, love, joy, pain, grief etc. - brilliantly in his book, he is an artist of words, painter of vivid imagination, his writing has enough power to break your heart and mend it on the same page. TFios pales in comparison to a gem like The Book Thief. I would rather shed my tears for a sick kid who doesn\u2019t know how to create a f**king metaphor than to shed my tear on any of Augustus and Hazel\u2019s ridiculous monologues. I would rather shed my tears for the children dying in the civil war in Syria than cry buckets over the death of a pretentious, unlikeable and flat character. Before you start calling me a cold-hearted bitch for hating and criticising this book, let me tell you that if you think you have every right to go around fangirling how wonderful this book was then I believe that I have every right to express my hatred for it whether you like it or not. I know that I\u2019m the only teenager on this planet who hates this book but honestly, I don't care. Would I recommend it? NO . I would rather recommend The Book Thief because it deserves the huge hype rather than this trash. Shailene Woodley has been cast as Hazel for the movie. She's simply perfect for Hazel's boring and unlikeable personality. *** I never mentioned or implied that teenagers are illiterate or can't have a large vocabulary, don't accuse me of something I haven't said. I just find it hard to believe that any teen can come up with nonsensical monologues like the ones below or think it's appropriate to use them in their conversations- \"I\u2019m awash in the metaphorical resonance of the empty playground in the hospital courtyard\u201d \u201cThat kid never took a piss without pondering the abundant metaphysical resonances of human waste production\u201d. (Like, wtf?!) Especially when they are living in the 21st century because English language is completely different than what it was few centuries ago. Also, it's hard to believe that anyone would talk like that in a normal conversation every single time. I am a teen and I go to high school, I know many other teens of my age who have developed a large vocabulary and have brilliant writing skills. That is simply because they love reading and have developed the habit of learning new words from the dictionary from a very young age. I know teens roughly my age with almost perfect speaking and writing skills in English. They write amazing poems and honestly, it takes them a lot of time to ponder over and make their metaphors or poems perfect. They obviously cannot open their mouth and spontaneously say \"My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations\". Btw, none of the teenage characters from this book show any interest in reading high literature and poetry (the only book Hazel claims to read is An Imperial Affliction ) then what's the reason behind their ability to spew pretentious monologues? What reason do they have to have a large vocabulary? They aren't geniuses, they aren't teens who read avidly or analyse high literature and show interest in oratory or love for poetry. Therefore, it's not plausible for them to speak with profound words. Moving on, the quotes and metaphors in this book are stupid and cliched. On deeper analysis you'll understand that the philosophy in this book is not real philosophy, it's simply marketing. Take for example this quote- \"Life is not a wish granting factory\" How many times have I heard this outside the book? For me the quote above is not a good one. Why? I've been told since I was 3 that life won't give you everything you want. A good quote, imo, tells you something new and it makes you ponder over a new thing, in the case of the quote above, it tells me nothing new, it shows me nothing new and doesn't make me think about anything new because I've already thought over the unfairness of life 1000 times before. That quote is just paraphrased and the whole book is littered with such paraphrased version of quotes that we already come across daily in our lives in simple version. People fall for such quotes because it's written with profound words that make them feel that TFIOS teaches a lot of new things. John Green is not a good author, he's simply a marketing genius. He has nothing new and interesting to tell and write. Now going over the cigarette metaphor, Augustus buys a pack of cigarettes regularly just so he could put one in his mouth and not light it thus, giving us another stupid dialogue \"It's a metaphor. You keep the killing thing between your teeth but don't give it the power to kill you\". Funny that he won't kill himself by lighting up the cigarette but will regularly give money to an industry that is the largest cause of cancer thus, promoting the cigarette industry and indirectly killing others. (What a genius!) Not to mention that he mocks Hazel's cancer right on her face and guess her reaction? She's impressed and readily approves of and participants in his metaphor. There's a lot of difference between being wise and being pretentious and Hazel and Augustus are the latter. I don't buy their dialogues because they are extremely ridiculous and cheesy and no argument by fans and authors can change my opinion because Green makes no effort in making the dialogues IN THE BOOK seem plausible. There's no reason for their large vocabulary and ability to spew long monologues IN THE BOOK and I'm analysing only the book nothing outside it, so why should I listen to an outside source? I've read Green's post on Augustus' character being pretentious and imo, he misses the point that his characters are not only pretentious; they are extremely unrealistic as well. Augustus' pretension is not \"an intentional flaw\", it's simply poor characterisation. I'm not saying that kids with cancer cannot be intelligent. A lot of fans say that the characters in the book are special and wise because they have cancer and this book tries hard to show that too. I merely said that having cancer does not mean that you can automatically become wise and gain a lot of knowledge. Don't twist my words. I couldn't sympathise with the characters and feel their pain. That doesn't mean that I'm cold hearted. It's not my fault that I couldn't get emotionally connected to the characters, it's the authors fault for not writing characters I could sympathise with. It's the author's fault for making shallow, judgemental and annoying characters. It's the his fault for making characters with personality that mocks cancer patients and who show disrespect to millions of people who died in the Holocaust. It's the author's fault for romanticising cancer and using it as a ploy to sell his book. I'm NOT hating people who have cancer, I'm NOT hating the characters because they have cancer. I'm hating them for who they are. I'm hating the book because it's poorly written. I don't need to have cancer to analyse this book. Having cancer does not mean that you get the rights to say whatever you want to about this book. Every reader whether sick or not has equal rights to analyse and voice their opinions freely on any book. And before you say \"omg you don't have cancer and you're not dying so you'll obviously not understand this book!!!111!!!1!!\" let me tell you that you know nothing about me. You don't know what I'm going through, you don't know my lifeline, then what gives you the right to judge what my life is like? I'll leave you with another quote- \"I got bored of this book the way you fall asleep: slowly and then all at once.\" /end rant [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more I HATE this book.

I hate the fact that it gifted me with so much Laughter, Smiles and Chuckles when I was expecting to come face to face with tragedy at any moment....it changed my expectations, made me believe in Something which did not happen...or maybe did happen. I hate the fact that while Hazel Grace fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once , I just fell ...no warning, no time to process the myriad emotions coursing through me, nope, nothing, just a huge endless void-filled fall and then a sudden crash that took my breath away, like literally... I hate the fact that I fell in love with this bound-to-end-in-oblivion, bound-to-end-in-disaster boy who stared with blue blue eyes and put the killing thing right between his teeth, but never gave it the power to do its killing. (Putting a cigarette right between your teeth and never lighting it, yes, that's Augustus Waters for you, people, a guy huge on metaphors and symbolism...that hopeless boy). I hate the fact that when I least expected it, the story, the words just grabbed me and pulled me in so deep that even the thought of ever resurfacing never entered my mind. I hate that the fact that right in the middle of my dance in the rain of laughter, dry wit, and humour without any warning, without any lightning as it's precedent, this thunder would stun me, startle me, wipe the smile right off my face, and sober me up, wake me up from the intoxication of the very real yet false jocularity spun by them , a humour which was nothing but human tragedy waiting-to-happen-and-had-already-happened in disguise and then push me back into that rain to dance again. I hate the fact that I'm not making my much sense right now....that right now my thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations... And yes, all the hate above is a metaphor, a symbolic word for love ... weird, right? But right now I can't bring myself to say that I love this book ....I don't, I don't, I don't (yes, I do, I do, I do... ) So, *deep breath*, it's a story of a girl named <---C>Hazel Grace Lancaster</---C> , a girl diagnosed with thyroid cancer at the age of 13 who's still alive at 16 thanks to a miracle drug which didn't work it's miracle in about 70% of the people but it did work in her. So, even though her lungs suck at being lungs , she's still alive and well not kicking, but breathing, with difficulty (because remember her lungs suck at being lungs), but breathing nonetheless. She's been nothing but a terminal case ever since her diagnosis. The doctors are simply finding ways of keeping her alive rather than removing the cancer ridden lungs and replacing it with a new one, because let's face it, her chances of surviving such an operation are like next to nothing and why waste a good pair of lungs on a given, bound-to-fail body? So, Hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis . Enter Augustus Waters . He's 17, gorgeous, in remission, and very frankly and much to her surprise interested in her. It's a match made in Cancer Kid Support Group, in the Literal Heart of Jesus (you'll know what that means when you read the book...you'll laugh, trust me, you will). He is a tenured professor in the Department of Slightly Crooked Smiles with a dual appointment in the Department of Having a Voice That Made My Skin Feel More Like Skin . He's the unexpected, hot, gorgeous twist in her story...a story which is about to be completely rewritten... Their story begins with a staring contest ...he stares at her... So she stares back...because let's face it... ( Spoiler Alert: She wins.) And it progresses into something brilliant, something as bright as the stars, into Something with a capital S.... I hate this book. (This needs indefinite repetitions, I hate it). I hate the fact that I fell in love with their always . \"Okay\" I hate the fact that Hazel Grace took the words right out of my mouth when she said what she said about being a vegetarian... \"I want to minimise the number of deaths I am responsible for,\" and about not knowing what's cool... \"I take a lot of pride in not knowing what's cool.\" I hate the fact that I fell in love with this blue-eyed boy who drove horrifically and his cheesy and yet very endearing attempts to be Prince Charming....(but more so with him...the surprised, excited and innocent side of him..) \"May I see you again?\" he asked. There was an endearing nervousness in his voice. I smiled. \"Sure.\" \"Tomorrow?\" he asked. \"Patience, grasshopper,\" I counseled. \"You don't want to seem overeager.\" \"Right, that's why I said tomorrow,\" he said. \"I want to see you again tonight. But I'm willing to wait all night and much of tomorrow .\" I hate the fact that Hazel Grace felt like a grenade and all she wanted to do was minimise the casualities when (not if but when ) she blew up... I hate the fact that I felt sorry for a lonely swing set...a Desperately Lonely Swing Set Which Needed a Loving Home ...or maybe it was simply a Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing Set Which Sought the Butts of Children ...and the fact that I absolutely love this sentence.... The Lonely Swing Set... or maybe Just Vaguely Pedophilic... And even though I fell in love the way you fall from a cliff or a building, (don't really know how that feels..since I've never done that).. I hate the way she fell in love... I hate this kiss ....because for who so firm that cannot be seduced? And then we were kissing. My hand let go of the oxygen cart and I reached up for his neck, and he pulled me up by my waist onto my tiptoes. As his parted lips met mine, I started to feel breathless in a new and fascinating way. The space around us evaporated, and for a weird moment I really liked my body; this cancer-ruined thing I'd spent years dragging around suddenly seemed worth the struggle, worth the chest tubes and the PICC lines and the ceaseless bodily betrayal of the tumors. I hate the love letter she wrote him...( Spoiler Alert: It's a Venn diagram love letter.) I hate the fact that she did not agree with Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (in which Abraham Maslow, an American psychologist, claimed that certain needs must be met before you can even have other kinds of needs.) Something like this... Unless and until your needs of the previous level have been fulfilled, you don't even think about the needs of the next level. Of course, like all psychological theories this one too cannot be generalized or accepted universally. Because if there is one law in psychology then it is that there is no law in psychology, there is no given universal laws for human behaviour or thoughts or anything . Every theory has it's use and flaws, applicable to some while not applicable to others. And this one is not applicable in this situation. Nope, not at all. I hate the words, the word play in this book... a quantum entanglement of tubes and bodies....triumphantly digitized contemporaneity.... I hate the fact that it made me laugh so much, smile a lot, fall in love so hard only to exact revenge later on for giving in to the false security of humour and love by making me cry....oh god, cry so much....so much... Because that's the thing about pain, it demands to be felt. I get it...totally get it... I hate the fact that I ever read this sentence... \"I lit up like a Christmas tree, Hazel Grace...\" . I hate it, I really hate it (forget metaphorical resonances, forget symbolism, I actually hate it). I hate the fact that it made me cry so much that the lovers of-god-knows-which-century entwined on my pillowcase were drenched in the torrent of my tears and were probably ruing the fact that there was no umbrella during their time. I hate the fact that I stayed up whole night reading this book , half of the night crying, and even after finishing it I couldn't go to sleep, so the rest of the dawn just pacing in my room with all these haphazard, desultory stars jumping around in my mind finding absolutely no avenue to become constellations .....and my eyes puffy (Note to self: Do not stay up all night or add crying to it if you do to avoid puffy eyes.) Why do I do this to myself?? And I absolutely hate this... I hate that this story is stunningly overwhelming, insightful, irreverent, raw and devastating...and to quote Markus Zusak, it's the kind of story reading which \"You laugh, you cry and then you come back for more.\" Some infinities are bigger than other infinities... ...I'm grateful for having known this little infinity ...grateful for this epic love story of two star crossed lovers .... [image error] I like my choices. I hope you like yours. And by hate you know I meant love, right? I love this book. Right now, my thoughts are too jumbled up... ...more 1.5 stars. EDIT: Changed the rating because it's gotten to the point where my sister and I have inside jokes on how stupid and shallow this book is. I can't think about this book without getting angry. I have a history with pretentious people. My biggest mess involved two boys in particular who were so incredibly full of themselves that for the first time in my life, I openly expressed my dislike to them. They know that I couldn\u2019t care less about their \u201chotness\u201d or just how amazing they were. So go 1.5 stars.

In short, my personality clashes with theirs entirely and there really is no chance of a friendship. I\u2019d dive into it, but then this wouldn\u2019t be a book review. And so I move on. <+++>The Fault in Our Stars</+++> is my first John Green book. Yeah, I know, but I didn\u2019t really get into reading up until maybe four years ago. And I\u2019m not too into contemporary, but the opportunity presented itself and I took my first dive. My sister is a fan of John Green. She really loves Looking for Alaska and Will Grayson, Will Grayson and finds Paper Towns to be LfA\u2019s quirky New Girl twin that doesn\u2019t own up. I almost feel bad for disliking this book, but that\u2019s strictly on the idea of cancer. Cancer is horrible, unpredictable, and the worst part is that it\u2019s your own cells mutating against you. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to defeat. That\u2019s what I wish this book was about: dealing with the cancer that wants to kill you. Instead, I get a book about a fictional miracle drug that keeps Hazel alive so she can have a boy love her (view spoiler) [then die (not even on sight either) (hide spoiler) ] . I came into this book with an open mind, I assure you. But I ended up really wanting to put the book down several times. From the first few pages, I felt something was actually wrong. Like I didn\u2019t know what I was getting myself into. Having finished this book, which, to me, was such a chore to do, I think I\u2019ve stumbled upon decent reasons as to why I really can\u2019t give this any more than two stars. If you didn\u2019t know by now, The Fault in Our Stars tells the story of Hazel, a girl whose thyroid cancer has ceased to grow thanks to a magical miracle drug. But because her cancer life is just so boring, a boy has to make it better. Because that is the only way anything gets better in life. Boyz. Cancer People, Dear Readers WRITING This was by far the largest problem I had. Larger than Hazel saying, \u201cI wanna tap that\u201d about Augustus on page 8. This prose was not the voice of a real teenager. It tried, but this did not sound like a teenager suffering from cancer. This was the voice of a teenager who liked to say, \u201cYou know what sucks? Cancer. You know what else sucks? Dying.\u201d Why? So the reader could laugh. And wouldn\u2019t you know it every line is like that . There is no rest for any real emotion or interest. It\u2019s all laced with some one-liner or trying to be hilariously philosophical when it\u2019s just trying way too hard to keep a reader interested. And this alone, made me find great distaste in the character of Hazel. She is not believable because I never learned anything about her. She just hates Support Group and adores Augustus for reasons that were never clarified throughout the book. Oh you like Gus\u2019s smile, his laugh? The idea that he thinks of basketball really as a nod to a baby toy? The idea that he spends money just so he can conduct a metaphor that doesn\u2019t do anything but make him look like a pretentious asshole? Oh who am I kidding. This entire book was shallow and pretentious. Everyone thought they were so hilarious because did you know that eggs are restricted to a breakfast food? Those poor scrambled eggs! No, I don\u2019t give a flying fuck about scrambled eggs and their apparent oppression . But think about it! We only have eggs for breakfast! Because you choose to point it out as such. Or get this, how about the hurdles event in track? You know what Augustus says about hurdles? He says this after that beautiful basketball connection to a child shoving cylinders into circle holes: \u201c And I wondered if the hurdlers ever thought, you know, \u2018This would go faster if they just got rid of the hurdles.\u2019\u201d THIS IS ONE OF THE STUPIDEST THINGS I HAVE EVER READ IN A BOOK. Augustus Waters, actual athlete , says something like this about a sport. Sports are a very healthy way to escape stress. If anything, Augustus and his philosophical ass should be wondering what the hurdles represent to the hurdlers. HURDLES ARE A SPECIAL EVENT. The hurdlers are probably doing a running event too! They CHOSE to run the hurdles for the challenge. But this falls on the level of those scrambled eggs. Hey! If we talk about this and make it sound funny, it\u2019ll be deep! It\u2019ll really scratch the heads of the readers! This just shows how silly and thoughtful Augustus is! Don\u2019t you guys just want to get with him and his awesome cigarette metaphor that HE SPENDS MONEY ON FOR NO FUCKING REASON? Guh, you fucking stupid ignorant son of a bitch. This was the line, by the way, that got me in that level of dislike for Augustus that I got on with the asshole dudes that exist in my life. And Hazel just sort of accepts this. Like, what the hell is everyone thinking in this book? What universe are they in? Because this is not a real universe. I think now I\u2019m tracking into character territory so here: CHARACTERS Hazel was the girl who referred to testicular cancer as \u201ccancer to the balls\u201d and then she sees Augustus Waters on page 8 of this book and goes, \u201c Look, let me just say it: He was hot. A nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is, at best, awkward and, at worst, a form of assault. But a hot boy\u2026well \u201d Remember, if you\u2019re not drop dead gorgeous, men, your nice glances are only awkward. That\u2019s it. You can never go farther, and your delicious insight on life will never win the heart of a girl. Because you are just not sexy enough or Augustinian for it. Hazel likes to do this. She likes to put down other guys for her Gus, even though they still BARELY knew each other. I met Kaitlyn and her (cute but frankly not Augustinian) boyfriend for coffee one afternoon. LOOK AT THAT. What. What is that? This was a nice guy and Hazel\u2019s like, \u201cWell he\u2019s not a fucking Greek God so no thank you.\u201d But what about Augustus, Hazel? You went to his house to watch a movie that you decided was just a silly boy movie that you knew you wouldn\u2019t like because you were a girl. MOVIES DON\u2019T WORK LIKE THAT. What are you even doing! You know what I just realized? Hazel is a lot like Mary in The Forest of Hands and Teeth. She hates one thing and loves only one material thing. Hazel hates the cancer support group, and loves An Imperial Affliction . Mary hates the Unconsecrated, but loves the ocean. That\u2019s all they have to their name. Which is AMAZING to me that Augustus finds something to love about Hazel. All it is is her John Green wit. If you asked Gus what else was there to Hazel besides this one book thing and her wit, I bet you a hundred dollars that he would respond as Derek in Swan Princess did with \u201cWhat else is there?\u201d Because that\u2019s all their love is. They\u2019re not bonding over the fact they have cancer. They bonded over An Imperial Affliction then experienced an intensified Hey Arnold! Episode about visiting the author who, to no one\u2019s surprise I hope, was a complete jackass then makes a 180 because\u2026because. Who needs reasons. HOWEVER, the half star is devoted to Mr. Peter Van Houten, who was the only actual character in this book. Everyone else was flat and pretentious assholes. When Van Houten did it, there was history behind it and a REASON. He actually had an arc! He did things! Despite my lack of care for Augustus and Hazel, the way Peter treated them was abhorring and the only way for me to fix that was to stab the man in the eye. But he changed, and revealed WHY he acted the way he did and there was sense made and he was a good character. STRUCTURE Structure was fine. Still flowed okay despite my need to be done with this. OVERALL I honestly thought everything was funny. I laugh at a loooooot of stuff. This, whatever this is, is not really that funny. It\u2019s shallow, and not really geared to people who want to know the world of cancer and stepping over the obstacle. It\u2019s a cancer-filled girl loving (view spoiler) [and losing (hide spoiler) ] a cancer-filled boy. Oh and they meet their favorite author who\u2019s actually an asshole. Cancer is the backseat, and I almost find it insulting. I don\u2019t understand why people love this. Tell me all you want that Augustus is a beautiful boy and Hazel just wanted something different in her life, but don\u2019t you DARE tell me that this is deep. This is not a deep book, there\u2019s nothing that touches my heart except shallow wit and a poor man suffering from the cancerous death of his 8 year-old ray of sunshine. I could go on, but I think this is enough. If it isn\u2019t, well that\u2019s your opinion. This is mine. You are just gonna have to deal. Final Remarks: This book should have been about what happened to Peter Van Houten. It\u2019d be perfectly parallel to that Hey Arnold! episode I mentioned, but it\u2019d be better than what I read. OR, this book should have been about Hazel WITH THE TERMINAL CANCER. Because her inner conflict with cancer would better clash with her ability to be with Augustus and it would've fleshed her out a hell of a lot more than giving her a magical miracle drug.

Let's take a moment and consider all the implications of that, and why he is making a colossal understatement when he described the experience as \"devastating.\" That was about twelve years ago, and Green has said in interviews that because of this experience, he's spent twelve years trying to write a book about kids with cancer - not poster children of strength and courage and illness-granted wisdom, but real kids and their families and friends who have to cope with the fact that they will die young. All novels are personal, but Green's novels seem, to me, to be especially so. But this one is personal in a different way. With this novel, Green isn't trying to exorcize the memory of the girl who stomped on his heart in high school . This goes deeper than high school romance and Manic Pixie Dream Girl angst. This is about life, death, illness, love, heroism, and how a sixteen-year-old is supposed to deal with the fact that she will die and leave everyone she loves behind. Maybe it's just because I've been watching vlogbrothers videos for four years and feel like I'm actually acquainted with John Green, but this is the most deeply personal novel I've ever read. This is not, as Hazel Lancaster might say, a Cancer Book. None of the cancer patients in this story have a wisdom beyond their years, and they do not stoically accept the fact that they will die or fight heroically. Hazel Lancaster, a terminal sixteen-year-old who has to carry an oxygen tank everywhere because \"my lungs suck at being lungs\" is refreshingly real - not manic, not a pixie, not a dream girl. She reads Great Books and watches America's Next Top Model marathons. Augustus Waters, her amputee friend, wants desperately to leave a lasting impression on the world and philosophizes about heroism, and his favorite book is a novelization of a video game. (can I say how much I love that an author can establish a character's intelligence without telling us that they love reading Austen yes Stephenie Meyer I'm looking at you ) Everything here is real, especially the diseases. There isn't any bullshit about dying gracefully here, because cancer is ugly and unpleasant, and Green makes you feel Hazel's lungs struggling to breathe and the pain, and see the vomit and urine. (Remember how in A Walk to Remember , Mandy Moore has been secretly dying of leukemia the whole time but looks great even on her deathbed? Nicholas Sparks can fuck right off for that insult to real cancer patients) Most importantly, Hazel and Augustus are not defined by their cancer. It consumes their lives, but it doesn't define them. On every page, it's clear: this is a story told by someone who hasn't known just one person with cancer, but has seen a multitude of children with terminal diseases, and has tried to find some way to comfort them and their families. It's for that reason that I don't feel like I can review this like a normal book. John Green didn't write this story for me, and so I don't feel like I have any place saying that it's amazing and beautiful and heartbreaking. And I certainly can't criticize any of its minor faults. All I can say, really, is that you have to read this for yourself, and go from there. ... Okay, you guys know me better than that. I have one big complaint, which I will describe here, and all I ask is that you remember that I still gave this five stars. Augustus Waters, in the first few chapters, comes off as a pretentious douche. When Hazel first meets him at a cancer support group, they're talking afterwards and Augustus takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth. Hazel, who you'll recall is dying because her lungs cannot function, freaks out: \"...even though you HAD FREAKING CANCER you give money to a company in exchange for the chance to acquire YET MORE CANCER.\" Augustus explains that he doesn't smoke the cigarettes, he just puts them in his mouth (no, really) because \"They don't kill you unless you light them...And I've never lit one. It's a metaphor, see: you put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing.\" Augustus, I love you, but you're full of shit right there. Notice how he didn't address Hazel's perfectly valid point that, by buying cigarettes, Augustus is giving money to the people who cause cancer? Because here's the thing: you can say to a cigarette company, \"I'm buying your cigarettes as a metaphor, but I won't light them so I'm taking away their power\" and they'll stop listening at \"I'm buying your cigarettes\" because that's all they care about. And it's a shit metaphor in any case: you can walk around a mall with a shotgun and explain to people that because it's unloaded you've taken away its power, but you're still going to get arrested. So that was annoying, as was Augustus's general air of overly-charming pretentious skeeziness in the beginning. But I forgive him for it, because lest we forget, he is seventeen. If his character was twenty-two he'd be the most obnoxious jackass on the planet, but because he's just a kid, I was willing to forgive him. Still hate the cigarette thing, though. ...more It seems silly that I have to say this, but I've seen many a negative review of this book met with backlash from John's nerdfighter fans, so I want to make one thing clear: I like John Green. You'll find plenty who worship him as a god amongst men and many who are highly critical of him, I fall into neither of these categories but I do like him and I enjoy watching his videos. I find him funny and I agree with a lot of what he stands for; I also appreciate the amount of charity work he does and It seems silly that I have to say this, but I've seen many a negative review of this book met with backlash from John's nerdfighter fans, so I want to make one thing clear: I like John Green.

I find him funny and I agree with a lot of what he stands for; I also appreciate the amount of charity work he does and the way he helps the \"nerds\" feel better about themselves and make it out of high school a little less scarred than they might have been. I like John Green. But I do not particularly like this book. There are plenty of people raving about this book on goodreads, on Kirkus, in various magazines and newspapers... so I realise I am in a tiny minority. I will also admit that I might not have felt the same if I hadn't already subjected myself to numerous \"cancer books\" but, as it is, I do not feel anything that unique or interesting has been brought to the table here. For the first half (approx), despite my lack of enthusiasm, I expected to give it three stars because I didn't consider it to be a bad book and it was well-written enough; however, as the book wore on, I began to realise that I was growing more and more bored and found myself struggling to read on. This was something I hadn't anticipated. I'd prepared myself for many different possibilities: heartbreak, a changed perspective on life and death, disdain, annoyance... but not bored indifference. Hence the lower rating. One of the first problems I encountered was that the kids were wise beyond their years. And I don't mean intelligent, I mean wise. They came out with things that really only suit people who've been alive a few centuries - like Dumbledore or Gandalf - or at the very least people who are sat comfortably in middle age. I like that Green doesn't patronise his readers by oversimplifying things or dumbing down characters in a condescending effort to appeal to teenagers, but these characters behave in a way that is unnatural to the point where sometimes it is verging on ridiculous. It's not completely unbelievable that some kids exist who are actually like this, but they definitely don't all speak and behave in this way. The characters are all, in one way or another, John Green. They all have his quirkiness, his sense of humour; I was picturing several John Greens sat around having a conversation while I was reading The Fault in Our Stars . In fact, reading this book was a little bit like watching one of Green's vlogs, which might have worked well if JG hadn't dampened the humour with philosophical musings. As it was, I had a book that was trying so very hard to be both funny and sad at the same time and ended up failing to deliver either one as successfully as I would have liked. The dialogue felt false and scripted because of the teens' tendency to showcase their depth and intelligence. Natural conversation between anyone of any age doesn't work like this and I couldn't shake the feeling that there should be a laughter track playing in the background. The Fault in Our Stars , in my opinion, would have been far better if Green had stuck to humour like Andrews did in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl . I believe that the exaggerated characters and their unrealistic conversations would have been fine in a straight-up humour book because that's not supposed to portray something real and deep and moving. But Green loses it by trying to be philosophical and, in the end, I think he has produced a book that is as melodramatic and message-driven as any other on this issue. And his attempt to balance humour and sadness left me somewhat devoid of emotion throughout and provided fewer laughs than I'd hoped. Ultimately, I feel that JG sacrificed humour in order to be deep and philosophical - perhaps this book tried to be too many things, perhaps JG tried to be too clever. But Me and Earl and the Dying Girl was a much better book, in my opinion, because it did the whole serious illness + humour thing but didn't over-complicate things by being philosophical. Like I said near the beginning, perhaps I am just tired of these books and The Fault in Our Stars needs to be appreciated by someone who has not already exhausted themselves on similar efforts.

I am a self confessed John Green fan, I believe he is amongst the best of, not only YA, but fiction writers out there in general. This is a beautifully written book. There is very little to complain about in terms of style, plot, character, etc. However I couldn't, in all good conscience, give this any higher because it sits so badly with me. I have let this novel marinate for a couple of days now before writing this, and I just keep coming back to the same issues. Namely: Was this John Green's story to tell? It is the human condition to attempt to find hope in hopeless situations. But let me attempt to explain how watching a 17 year old fade away truly feels. Because when the wit and words are stripped away I am not sure John did that. It is endless. It is an unavoidable and uncontrollable and an all encompassing darkness where no hope or life or explanations exist. There are absolutely no life lessons to be gained from watching a 17 year old cease to exist. There is no comfort. The lessons that some may claim you can achieve through the darkest night of the soul reveal most of humanity for the selfish, narcissistic beings we are. I have come to believe there is a special kind of cruelty behind the perfectly cross stitched 'encouragement'. Those things are for the ones left over trying to make sense of the senseless. Whilst I believe this novel acknowledges that. It tries not to, as the main protagonists claimed theirselves, set the victims of disease up as typical heroic, worldly wise characters, it still reads like a novel attempting to bring equilibrium out of disaster. The victims ultimately still are wise beyond their years. This, it seems, is an assumed side effect of a teenager coming to terms with their mortality. They use metaphors and pretentious poetry and a sharp wit and are wholly unbelievable as real life teenagers. They are constructs of an ideal. They are the literary version of Dawson's Creek, using SAT vocabulary and existential navel gazing, whilst simultaneously slamming the typical genre for using its characters to do the same. Having lived this first hand; once with a brother who ceases to exist at 17 and a second time with a brother who is currently 2 years NEC. I am all too familiar with the need for light hearted humour at what may feel like the most inappropriate of times. But what differs from that and attempting to write a disease ridden novel that attempts to make you laugh, is apparently personal experience. I have the right to sit around a Christmas table laughing somewhat hysterically at nothing. My living brother has the right to crack UNO-ball jokes whenever the opportunity arises. But none of the readers of this novel who have not experienced the kind of loss depicted here have a right to laugh at any of it. You can not claim it as your own unless it is yours, and in my mind that is what humour does. It is not appropriate for me to laugh along with eye jokes and blind jokes, because they are not my jokes. I am merely a voyeur in another persons tragedy, I lay no claim to having the understanding of the experience necessary to allow for laughter. Again, let me make clear. I can not approach this book outside of my personal experience. Of course in reality I do not believe you have to have experienced everything to laugh at a joke. But in terms of purposefully trying to create humour in a novel that is fundamentally tragic, for an audience that is mostly YA, I struggle with. I struggle with it because the empty platitudes that are trying so hard to be subverted in this novel, are still being created. It is still suggesting there can be lightness and humour within the terminally dark - and it is suggesting it to people who have never experienced the terminally dark. This read like a novel where the author has truly witnessed the emptiness of teenage terminal illness, and thankfully appears to have become more considerate and thoughtful for it. As opposed to erring on the side of platitudes. But it still read as a novel attempting to explain where the hope in hopeless situations are. Perhaps because it is too raw a subject for me, or perhaps because the novel really is sentimental and gratuitous (granted in a different way from the norm of this genre) but this is not a book I would recommend. For sufferers, for family members of sufferers, or for well meaning people seeking to understand the hopelessness of some situations. I would recommend it for none. ...more As seen on The Readventurer The Fault in Our Stars currently has a rating of 4.74 on Goodreads, almost everyone I know has given it 5 stars, therefore I'm certain no one would want to read my sour musings, except me and maybe a couple of other like-minded and unimpressed.

What I'd love to know is this - what makes a writer undertake the topic of cancer? So much has already been written about it, so many Lifetime movies filmed, so many tears shed. It literally has been done to death. What new did John Green have to bring to the cancer table? The way I see it, nothing. Having your terminally sick characters be ironic about their illnesses and swap cancer jokes isn't groundbreaking. The Fault in Our Stars isn't a bad book, but it's a standard cancer book, and, sadly, a standard John Green book, with standard John Green humor and standard John Green characters speaking in the very same John Green voice. You have a witty and intelligent protagonist (this time 2, Hazel and Augustus - a female and male versions of Miles/Quentin/Colin), a funny, slightly pathetic sidekick (Isaac - another version of Hassan/Chip/Marcus), a mysterious, unhinged girl, Gus's dead ex (Alaska/Margo clone), and, of course, the signature ROAD TRIP. I can't help but recognize these people and this plot, I've read all of Green's novels. I understand why so many readers would have such an emotional response to the book. Nothing will get the ladies crying quicker than a kid dying of cancer. Add in some long farewells, painkillers, eulogies and funerals - you can collect buckets of tears. But, IMO, here Green aims for the most obvious, the most easily accessible emotions, for the most typical \"life lessons.\" And for all Green's attempts to be subversive and to make fun of \"cancer cliches\" - inspirational quotes, heroic cancer survivors, etc. he ended up writing about exactly the same things. Frankly, I think The Fault in Our Stars is Green's weakest work to date, weaker even than half-baked Zombicorns . Because this, unlike his earlier works, feels commercial and intentionally tearjerky and insincere. It will probably sell the most copies. ...more This is me after I finished the book (and whenever I think about it). *pointless EDIT* Woooah! 1000+ likes!?

Do whatever you want. As much of an amazing writer as I want to be.... I'm really not. So I'll just point out the things that made this book amazing. ;) I knew that I would cry so I really didn't bother swearing not to cry. What I didn't expect is bawling my eyes out. I really didn't. John Green has done an amazing job of making these characters feel so real to me. When they cried, I cried (bawled). When they laughed, I laughed. When they melted, I melted. Their romance was so epic and I know, I KNOW, that this is a book I will read over and over again and cry every single time. The characters were perfection! Especially Augustus Waters. Not only is his name Augustus (which is epic in itself) He had the guts to go up to Hazel and just straight up ask her to come hang out with him. Nice guys finish last? I think not. You know this book was so awesmazing that I gave it its own tag. Just look up there and you'll see a little tag that says \"the-fault-in-our-stars\". It was THAT amazing. Seriously. So amazing that I'm pretty sure it was my first heartbreak... from a book. I really haven't felt that much from a book, much less a person, in a very long time. (I'm kind of a loner and a commitment phob... not a good mix) But my heart didn't just do this 3, it did this \u00bb *BOOM!* (didn't have a sign for that) I wish I could write more about this book, but I just can't explain the amazingness of it with my simple, unworthy words, so I am going to tell you what you NEED to do....

But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazel's story is about to be completely rewritten. I don't think I've ever cried so much, laughed so much, just over all enjoyed a book as much as I have while reading The Fault in Our Stars. Everything that goes on is serious, heartbreaking and eye opening but John Green does an amazing job at, literally, making you laugh out loud. Even when you're suffering. Hazel... what a breathe of fresh air her character was. She was real and I loved her no bullshit attitude. She wasn't fooling herself, and John Green didn't make her out to be ecstatic with the world or her situation. She wasn't bitchy or depressing, but it wasn't like she was perfectly fine to sit idly and watch the time tick by. Augustus Waters is my dream guy. Like, for real.

Then again, is life ALWAYS fair for any of us? Hint: no. Hazel is such an honest main character. At first, I thought it was impossible she had cancer. Sometimes, I even forgot she had cancer! She accepts it and I began to accept it as well. I rarely read books with diseases or heavy subjects in fact, so loving this book wasn\u2019t in my pre-read expectations. BUT, I DID. OH, I DID. Will I re-read this book? YES, YES AND YES. I\u2019m not the queen of re-readings, I know a queen of re-readings and it\u2019s definitely not me. I\u2019m way too excited about newly released books or ones I\u2019m dying to read and haven\u2019t to take the time to re-read books. In fact, I think I only re-read 12 books in my entire life. And that was when I was younger and didn\u2019t know Goodreads existed, hehe. However, I know that, when I\u2019m going to re-read The Fault in Our Stars , I\u2019ll appreciate it even more than I do now, fall harder in love with Augustus and feel an even greater connection to Hazel. The originality of this book is beyond amazing. I kept thinking, ''how did John Green manage to invent all of that?'' He\u2019s a fantastic author with an impressive writing style and choice of words. I\u2019m so eager to read his other novels, in occurrence Looking for Alaska of which I heard only great things; it has a big amount of raving reviews. Hazel's family is adorable and full of love. She's so lucky to grow up surrounded by such comfortable and loving parents. I rarely see similar families in real life but they do exist so, yes, the story is also a believable one. Even the \u2018author\u2019 inside it feels real. In conclusion to this 100 180th review of The Fault in Our Stars , I recommend this novel to you with all my heart. I hope you\u2019ll love it as much as I did and find it inspiring and beautiful as well. Last updated: May 1st, 2016.

Are you tired of reading the word 'precocious' yet? Too bad, since adorable and fragile precociousness is at the 'literal heart' of this book. That's what alienated some readers - but I'm a sucker for precociousness in literature; guilty, your Honor! ------ Like with any literature, what you get out of this book varies based on how you choose to interpret it. You can see it as a shameless use of a serious medical condition in children in order to make money and get recognition (because it's kids dying from cancer, c'mon!) Cancer in kids has been used as a tearjerker before. Google 'TV tropes Littlest Cancer Patient', please. Here, I will save you the trouble . You can see it as a cutesy young adult love story. You can see it as a collection of quotable lines clearly put into the speech of teens by the middle-aged author. You can see it as yet another coming-of-age novel (there's even a requisite trip/adventure in there, really). You can even see it as a book trying really hard to NOT be a stereotypical 'cancer book' - to the point where characters are stating so at length. And you know what? All these are to some extent true. But what I got out of it, what made me tear up a bit was the motif of fragility of life as seen by the children who have a limited supply of that life, basically a limited 'infinity' . Reading it, I got a few flashbacks to Pediatric Oncology - the time in medical school when I realized that I'm not strong enough to be a pediatrician and see kids suffer and die. Hazel Lancaster and Augustus Waters are the two children with cancer. She has terminal thyroid cancer and is tethered to an oxygen tank; he falls victim to metastatic osteosarcoma (before you scream 'Spoiler!' in outrage, I sincerely ask you - how could you not have seen it coming?) They introduce themselves in their cancer support group by stating their diagnoses - and my heart breaks a little at the thought of children learning to define themselves by their disease. Even their favorite book is the cancer book. But no, \"I'm not cryyyying....\" This is not a perfect book. It relies a little too heavily on tearjerking. Frequently, it gets to be a bit too full of itself, occasionally cringeworthy - sometimes to eye-rolling extent. But with the quotability factor and the smart precociousness still comes the real sadness and cuteness and feeling that clawed its way into my heart and made me love it despite the imperfections. Maybe I liked it because of associations and memories it brought with it rather than for its own merits - but hey, the emotions will stay with me for a while, whatever the reason for them may be. I think this book would have a huge appeal to teenagers, its intended audience. The characters are relatable, they are intelligent, and the male lead manages to transform from 'oh, rly, jerk?' to a considerate and lovely young man. The parents are present in the lives of both teens and are portrayed in a very sympathetic light; definitely no 'absent parent syndrome' here! Plus, it has a healthy portrayal of teenage sexuality, unlike what we frequently see in young adult literature. So great book? No. But I easily give it 3.75 stars and therefore rounding up to 4 stars (Is the fault in them? Go figure.) \u201cThe pleasure of remembering had been taken from me, because there was no longer anyone to remember with.

He\u2019s the best friend I always wanted to have. A romantic, a fool romantic who has cancer in his eyes\u2026 This book is about love, friendship, fight, hope and life. And about infinites As I mentioned, Hazel is obsessed with Peter Van Houten. Apparently he never finished his book An Imperial Affliction so she decides to mail him asking for answers. Because as she said, authors shouldn\u2019t end their books if they\u2019re not finished, right? I am gonna do the same with some authors\u2026 And of course, if you ever do decide to write anything else, even if you don\u2019t want to publish it, I\u2019d love to read it. Frankly, I\u2019d read your grocery list. I might have mentioned that to one of my favourite M/M authors. I am pathetic! The days go by and Hazel and Augustus cannot stay away from each other and their relationship is soooooo freaking sweet. OMG, I am in love with Augustus Waters, he\u2019s probably the BEST book boyfriend EVER. \u201dOh my God, stop flirting with me!. We both know that okay is a very flirty word. Okay is BURSTING with sensuality\u201d. I just loved how the author made me laugh so much. I mean, I was reading a book about kids with cancer, I wasn\u2019t supposed to be laughing but I did. I did because those damn characters camped in my heart and they are planning to stay there forever . \u201dIt would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you\u201d. And you feel you\u2019re discovering love for the first time with them all over again. Like true love, that kind of love that comes from a friendship. A love that is not based on how hot you are but how interesting you are. A love that is based in understanding each other, in accepting that we are grenades that can explode, in being there for each other no matter what. This is probably one of the best and most real love stories I\u2019ve ever read in my entire life. I will never EVER forget this book, I actually ordered the paperback as I need to smell the book, I need to hug Hazel and tell her she\u2019s my new best friend even if this is also a one-sided friendship. I need to tell Isaac that his special person is going to come to his life one day and he\u2019s gonna know what real love is. I need to hug Hazel\u2019s father and tell him I freaking LOVE him because he reminded me of my father. A lot of families should take Hazel\u2019s family as an example. You need to give love if you want to receive love and that\u2019s what this family did. \u201dThe world is not a wish-granting factory\u201d. And even if the world is not a wish granting factory you cannot stop believing that good things will come because they will. You just need to be positive and enjoy what you have, enjoy every single second with the people you love just like Hazel & Augustus did. \u201dYou don\u2019t get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers.\u201d. ***The below is not about the book, is about my life, you might not want to read it but I have to say this*** That man on the picture was my best friend for almost 19 years, the man of my life, my half, the person who will be my example until the last day of my life. The person who taught me that reading was one of the best experiences in life. The BEST father ever! . His lungs didn\u2019t keep their shit together, as Hazel would say and he left us three months after being diagnosed with cancer (almost 12 years ago). While we were with chemo, and I say we because I used to go with him every Monday, I met a kid who was way too young to have cancer. I couldn\u2019t understand why kids had cancer, it wasn\u2019t fair. Once my father was gone I wanted to get something positive about that horrible experience so I started volunteering with an association that helped kids with cancer: AVOI. The guy who started this association had a kid with cancer who died and he decided to create this association to help families in that situation. He is an example for me. It wasn\u2019t my moment anyway because everything was very fresh and I couldn\u2019t help but think about my father every time I was with those kids and it\u2019s hard when you go back week after week and there are some kids that are not there anymore\u2026 This book reminded me of that association. Life sucks sometimes but while you can, get the best of it. Tell your friends and family you love them, don\u2019t assume they know you love them. Enjoy every single second with them because one day, death will take them or will take us. I will give years of my life for one more evening with my dad, to hear his voice one more time so PLEASE show your love and enjoy your family and friends while you can. I don\u2019t want you guys to feel sad about my story because I was lucky, I got to have the BEST father ever and that\u2019s something that makes me happy\u2026 ...more I feel so sorry for these privileged, middle-class, white teenagers. I had never read a John Green novel prior to reading this one. I wanted very much to like it and felt certain after reading some of the overwhelmingly positive reviews here that it would be an awesome and heartbreaking experience. I was ready and excited. I guess I could sum the experience up best by stating that it is unlikely I will read another book by this author, and if I do it will be sometime in the future when I forget how utterly disappointing I found this book to be. I had a lot of pro I had never read a John Green novel prior to reading this one. I wanted very much to like it and felt certain after reading some of the overwhelmingly positive reviews here that it would be an awesome and heartbreaking experience. I was ready and excited. I guess I could sum the experience up best by stating that it is unlikely I will read another book by this author, and if I do it will be sometime in the future when I forget how utterly disappointing I found this book to be. I had a lot of problems with this book. Overall, it felt very insincere and I was constantly distracted by how obviously everything was written with the goal of tugging on the reader's heart strings, rather than just letting things happen that were beautiful in spite of being sad. It felt like Mr. Green was screaming at me from the page 'ARE YOU SAD YET? YOU'RE SAD RIGHT? THIS IS SAD. YOU SHOULD FEEL ALL THE THINGS AND CRY ABOUT IT. I'M A GOOD WRITER. I WRITE FEELINGS. ARE YOU CRYING YET?' For a story about Human Beings, it doesn't feel very human at all. Instead everything feels very unnatural and self-conscious in the worst way. The biggest and most impossible thing for me to get around was I simply didn't believe the character of Augustus or his relationship with main character Hazel. As these concepts \u00a0are basically what the entire story hinges upon, I didn't believe in or care about anything else that happened either. Augustus came off completely pretentious and obnoxious, particularly in the way he insisted on speaking in a Diablo Cody nerd hipster sort of dialect that no one would ever use in the real world. (Some commenters here have said it's the way Mr. Green himself talks which, a.) way to be self-congratulatory, and b.) how does he not get punched in the face, like, ALL THE TIME?) His entire character felt contrived and I never once felt a connection with him. Too often it seemed like he was walking around like I AM SO CLEVER LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME, constantly putting on a show so that nothing from him felt genuine or real. His whole fascination with ultimately meaningless metaphors felt condescending, like Mr. Green constantly squealing HEY GUYS, SEE WHAT I DID THERE? TAKE A SECOND, WRITE IT DOWN IF YOU NEED TO. YEAH, I'M DEEP. Augustus' one fault was sickness, but it was nothing that he could control. And that's just so... boring. But it wasn't just Augustus. The character of Hazel was somewhat likable, (despite Mr. Green's insistance on making her 'sound like a teenager' by formating every other statement she makes like it's a question? and tacking distracting 'or whatever's onto the end of random bits of dialogue BECAUSE THIS IS HOW TEENAGERS TALK RIGHT? I CAN TALK LIKE A TEENAGER, SEE? BECAUSE THEY SAY 'WHATEVER'. I'M A GOOD WRITER. ARE YOU FEELING THINGS YET?) but her relationship with Augustus felt completely and totally forced. There was never any real reason for them to fall in love with one another, and that is crossing dangerously close into Twilight territory. He was so convienient, so effortless for Hazel. I had to wonder, was it him or was it because he was there and ready and willing? It all fell flat and left so many places to take the stories and facets of their characters completely unexplored. Any opportunities to delve into hard questions and real answers were left untaken and exchanged for large passages (mainly in the **SPOLIER ALERT**: Amsterdam trip scenes) that had very little purpose outside of screaming LOOK AT THIS HANDSOME CHARMING BOY ISN'T HE SWEET LADIES? HE WILL PULL YOUR CHAIR OUT FOR YOU AND HE TALKS LIKE I DO. IT'S CHARMING, RIGHT? YOU ARE FEELING CHARMED. I'M A GOOD WRITER. Ultimately, it felt completely fake. I couldn't get lost in it, always fully aware of the fact that I was reading fiction and how irritating EVERYTHING about it was. I finished it, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars, but it was a true task. Truthfully, it pissed me off. I would have loved to love this book as much as everyone else and have a new favorite to hold dear to my heart. Now I'm just confused. Was my copy broken? ...more Holy holy holy I waited so long for this novel, so long. I wish so bad I could give it more than 5 stars. John Green is absolutely amazing, amazing, amazing. The Fault in Our Stars had me laughing and crying, then laughing more and crying more. I will reread this over and over again, just like the rest of his novels. Oh wow, was it ever worth the wait. Thank you, John Green, for being so damn spectacular. Well... I think that about covers it. You can all go home now. Bye. ... But, seriously. I got more wrapped up in this book than I thought I would. Even though there was so much hype surrounding it, and John Green is a cool dude and all that ... for some reason, I put off reading this for a long time. I think it's because I tend to hate \"illness\" books. A lot of the time they tend to be overly corny and melodramatic and whatnot. And even the best of them ... well, from the very beginning you pretty Well... I think that about covers it. You can all go home now. Bye. ... But, seriously.

I think it's because I tend to hate \"illness\" books. A lot of the time they tend to be overly corny and melodramatic and whatnot. And even the best of them ... well, from the very beginning you pretty much know how it's going to end. If it's a good book on the subject, it's going to screw with your emotions and leave you in a curled up, emotional ball by the end. Which is what this book does. Yes, this book is rather bone-crushingly sad. But it's more than that. It also manages to be sweet and romantic and adorable\u2013\u2013as it simultaneously punches you in the face and rips your heart out. Isn't that grand? I couldn't help but fall in love with the characters, even though I knew horrible things were going to happen to them. I found myself totally enveloped in the story and unable to put the book down until I had finished. I don't really have much to complain about. (I know\u2013\u2013shocking!) I guess the only thing that occasionally bothered me was, sometimes the dialogue feels a little unnatural. Like, the characters start talking more like pretentious adults than high-school age kids. But I suppose going through so much trauma would age you a bit, so maybe it's not too surprising. Anyway, wonderful book. The characters, the writing, everything. It was just awesome. What can I say. ...more Let me start with how I feel My heart hurts. It bleeds, it cries. This book made me feel. How to articulate and not post a bunch of nonsensical babble.

Metaphorically speaking off course. And then there's this really sick girl, Hazel Grace. She lives by a book called, An Imperial Affliction by Peter Van Houten. By the way I think she is one of the best heroines ever written. This quote is the most eloquently descriptive I have ever come across. It made me cry. I'm crying right now.

I was afraid after 80% of the story,and not feeling emotional enough or teary eyes like EVERYONE's experience with the book , that I've grew a \"Hairy Heart\" like this story in J.K.Rowling's Harry Potter's Spin off: But I have to say I liked the story more cause of Peter and his Novel \"An Imperial Affliction\" plot, and that's the main reason of Hazel and Augustus get together. \"and the fact I used \"Felicity\"'s stars in the main roles \"I was just finished that book, you can know about the show at my review for that book\" But by the end -and again cause of Peter Van Houten's reappearance- I got \"teary eyes\" and uncontrollable one .. the wrapping of this plot hit me hard in heart.. Then the smooth ending \"Being in 14th July -MY BIRTHDAY :)\" with the lovely mother -who I really felt more emotions for her than expected too, I pictured her like Desperate Housewives' Bree Van De Kamp- That's what make it goes from 3 stars to 4 So, yes I must read again for John Green.. And I'll never forget the days with Hazel and Gus..they'll be in my memory.. Always... okay?

Some books will make you so mad that you\u2019d want to throw the book out the window or burn it in fury. Some books will leave you asking for more because it ended with a cliffhanger. Some books will leave you questioning why it ended the way it did. Some books will leave a mark on you not only because it made you cried buckets of tears or made you laugh until you couldn\u2019t breathe but because you felt something as you were reading it and that feeling would never leave you forever. The Fault in Our Stars left that kind of mark in me. It made me cry. It made me laugh occasionally. It made my heart ache. It made me giggly all over when Gus made his moves on Hazel. It made me feel all sort of things and for a book to have that effect on someone it must be really special. The Fault in Our Stars is one of the best books I\u2019ve ever read. EVER! Hazel has cancer. She already anticipated Death would soon be knocking on her door. She doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends because she keeps to herself. Why? She didn\u2019t want anyone else to be burdened by her death in case it comes. One day at support group he met Augustus (Gus) Waters. They just sort of clicked. Gus liked her but she didn\u2019t want to take their relationship to a higher level because she was afraid that she\u2019d cause him pain if she dies. Hazel think Gus was healthier than she is and that he\u2019ll have more time on earth than she does and that it would be unfair if she lets him in. But no matter how hard she tries to keep her distance from Gus, she just couldn\u2019t. Everything felt right. Fate however has different plans for them. There are so many things I want to say about this book but I\u2019m so afraid I might not get them all right. John Green, you have broken my heart into tiny little pieces. This book made my heart ache and my eyes burn with tears. There was just so much emotion in the pages of this book that it was so hard not to feel them. Hazel was an inspiration. I have never been that sick but I think if I was I wouldn\u2019t be as composed and as strong as she was. Despite her constant need to have an oxygen tank near her she still goes about and does things normally. She doesn\u2019t go out that much with friends though because she wanted to spare them the pain if ever she dies. And while Hazel was sometimes (most of the time) pessimistic, Gus was the exact opposite. He was Hazel\u2019s ray of sunshine. He has this sort of halo of positivity that makes the people feel good including Hazel. While Hazel was my inspiration, Gus was my favorite. I guess this book would not have been that much of a success without Gus. He was smart (though he often doesn\u2019t think so) and funny and sweet and kind and loving. (Damn! Where are all the Gus\u2019s hiding? I\u2019d like to get myself one! LOL.) I finished this book last night after coming home from work. On the last 3 or 4 chapters my eyes were flooded with tears that I can\u2019t stop. My mom actually got worried and asked me if I was okay and told her the reason I was crying was because of this book. The Fault in Our Stars was amazing. I would like to applaud Mr. Green for making such a wonderful and emotionally gripping novel that mirrors the lives of kids who has cancer. Hazel, Gus, Isaac and all of the other kids in the memorial maybe fictional characters but what they were experiencing maybe happening to someone else right now. The characters in this book seemed so real like you and me. Hazel and Gus seemed too mature for their age. Was it the cancer? Possibly but it\u2019s actually something so minor that I don\u2019t care if they think too maturely. I can deal with that. One thing I noticed though was how it reminded me a little (really just a little) of one of my favorite books by Nicholas Sparks, A Walk to Remember. Gus reminded me of Jaime. Gus changed something in Hazel just like Jaime did to Langdon. Jaime and Gus left their mark. They may have passed but they will never be forgotten. Anyhow, I totally love this book. I highly recommend it. No graphic scenes here so in my opinion it\u2019s totally safe for the teenage kids to read. :) I am so in love with you Mr. Green. Too bad you\u2019re married and with kids. (Just kidding!) But my friends and I will be reading Looking for Alaska next hopefully they would be as great as this one. I give this perfect 5 stars! ...more you have a choice in this world, i believe, about how to tell sad stories, and we made the funny choice. john green, like his characters, always makes the funny choice. and readers, like \"women\" are really just looking for a sense of humor. and the sense of humor goes a long way towards pardoning other sins. because come on, john green - your characters are so unlikely. ordinarily, i would squirm at such clever,verbose,insightful, literary-reference-dropping teenagers. but they are so funny and c you have a choice in this world, i believe, about how to tell sad stories, and we made the funny choice. john green, like his characters, always makes the funny choice. and readers, like \"women\" are really just looking for a sense of humor. and the sense of humor goes a long way towards pardoning other sins. because come on, john green - your characters are so unlikely. ordinarily, i would squirm at such clever,verbose,insightful, literary-reference-dropping teenagers. but they are so funny and charming, always. your humor is what saves you from my criticism. (view spoiler) [Augustus was amazing, but he'd overdone everything at the picnic, right down to the sandwiches that were metaphorically resonant but tasted terrible and the memorized soliloquy that prevented conversation. It all felt Romantic, but not romantic. (hide spoiler) ] not really a spoiler, but best be on the safe side. (and i can't believe i had to use capital letters there. felt...unnatural) but the point of that is - ah, to have been able, at seventeen, to take the emotional out of the equation and view the situation so critically. for me, anyway - it wouldn't have happened. i would have been overwhelmed with gratitude and any more intellectual approach to the situation would have been inconceivable. but who cares - i don't even know why i went on that boring tangent. because john green (when i say his name, you should see little hearts coming out from my ears - \u2665john green\u2665) has enough skills to make these potentially unbelievable characters consistently entertaining and to do the unthinkable of making a YA cancer book very very funny. when i was an emotion-blinded teen, reading all those lurlene mcdaniels books, who knew that someday, there would be funny Ya-tragedy books? this is not funny: but john green is . and i'm sure if i read Six Months to Live now, it would feel manipulative and cloying. (but i would probably still love it with all my nostalgia) this book is not at all manipulative and never cloying. it's all wisecracking in the valley of the shadow of death, in a genuinely funny, not snarky, way. okay, occasionally snarky. they are teens, after all. (jesus, i may have forgotten to mention that this book is funny. did i? mention it?) but it is also about the dangers of hero-worship and the desire to leave something in the world that is yours after you go, and anne frank (yes. anne freaking frank) \u2665john green\u2665 is just a skillful and sophisticated YA author, who has really raised the bar for realistic YA everywhere. (baffling an 85-year-old co-worker of mine who wanted to write to our company to have this reclassified as adult fiction because he read it, not knowing anything about it, and figured it was a mistake. \"no, he's a teen novelist.\" \"but the new york times reviewed it as an adult novel.\" \"incorrect. it says \"teen\" on the dust jacket. printz award. you just read a YA book, dude! hhahaahahahaa! and you liked it!! score for YA!!\" (this last sentence did not actually happen, but the rest of it did)) great isaac and augustus relationship - he does boy-friends so well. great parents for hazel. great job as a female narrator. (and a definite departure from the margo/alaska girl this time.) great great great. (also, funny) so - four stars. because after serious reflection, i still think paper towns is better, and needs to bask in its five-stars-from-karen-dom all alone. also - this book did not make me cry, goddamn it. i thought it would be an easy cry. but no. damn these eyes.

After all, it was I who spent time reading this book. I guess it has something to do with the fact that so many friends and relatives raved about this book being sad and great prior to my reading. For example, an 8-year old niece of my wife said that she cried while reading the book because it is about teenagers with cancer. Then of course most of my GR friends, foreigners and locals alike, rated this book with either 4 or 5 stars. So, when I started reading this book, I th I can be honest, right?

For example, an 8-year old niece of my wife said that she cried while reading the book because it is about teenagers with cancer. Then of course most of my GR friends, foreigners and locals alike, rated this book with either 4 or 5 stars. So, when I started reading this book, I thought I already clammed up. Maybe I was just trying to be different or I would like to show my wife's 8-y/o niece that the book is YA and I am too old (mature) compared to her and have outgrown books like this and definitely would not cry over some silly stories about lovers with cancer. My Dad died of brain cancer in 1997 so definitely I have a big compassion for people suffering from any kind of cancer. However, what is John Green's purpose of using cancer has a major element in this book's romance? Obviously, it is to manipulate people's emotion. It is to gain sympathy because his female readers would like to cry buckets of tears especially if the guy is as good-looking as Augustus the apple of the eyes of our heroine who is also cancer-stricken, Hazel. I mean cancer, like death, is something that we normally don't want to talk about and if we need to talk about it, we usually have a purpose. Sadly, in my opinion, John Green has no particular purpose but for commercial reason: to generate sympathy that means more readers, more sales, more money to bring to the bank. There is nothing new in this book. Hazel's I want to leave a mark prior to dying is everybody's wish really. Augustus' I am not my cancer is too heroic. We all know that it is not true, we all got our big frustrations or lost in lives. We all have been sick at some point in our lives and we go through a period of denial and even if we say we accepted everything, we always keep on hoping that the sickness or the problem would disappear that's why we continuously pray to God. I mean the acceptance is there and we are at peace with ourselves but still call God to interfere and take the sickness away. I just did not feel anything reading this book except the feeling of being manipulated. It's too pretentious and gimmicky. I know John Green is laughing his way to the bank especially because some movie people took advantage of this book's popularity so this even has a big screen adaptation. My goodness. ...more Hazel is a 16 year old girl with stage IV thyroid cancer, and has been living with an oxygen tank since she was first diagnosed at 12.

A few months ago John made a video on his youtube Hazel is a 16 year old girl with stage IV thyroid cancer, and has been living with an oxygen tank since she was first diagnosed at 12. She realizes she is going to die, but she is on a drug that is keeping the tumors at bay. At a support group meeting she meets hottie Augustus Waters, who is in remission. They immediately hit it off and change each others lives drastically. The Fault in Our Stars is another beautifully written book by John Green. A few months ago John made a video on his youtube channel, and in this video he read the first two chapter of this book. I was hooked instantly. I wanted to know everything there was to know about Hazel and Augustus. I'm not going to say that this was the most original cancer book out there, but it felt more personal. Let's start with the characters. John Green wrote the same exact character over and over again in his previous books. This is one complaint I've always had, but you won't find that here. Hazel is no Alaska Young, she is no Margot. She's just Hazel, and she's lovely. Same with Augustus. He's unlike all of John Greens male characters, and I adore him. There is simply one complaint I have about this book. John needs to make his 17 year old characters sound more like 17 year old teens than 35 year old men. Most of the dialog in this book and sweet and enjoyable, but then the characters come out with these crazy words and there are other ways to show your characters are intelligent people without always making them spout out these weird, random words. In all honesty it's a bit annoying, but it doesn't bother me too much, because I understand that his younger readers will build a much better vocabulary if they pay attention. Also, his book is full of quotable lines as you can clearly see from everyone else's reviews. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. John is a phenomenal writer. He's great at building suspense when needed, and also at hitting you in the gut with a healthy dose of raw emotion. Almost everyone I know who has read this book cried. At least a little. He also throws in lots of humor which is usually appreciated to break up sad moments. As far as John writing a female voice for the first time, I thought he did a good job. This book wasn't life-changing for me, but I easily could see how others could be affected by this book in an astounding way. It tackles cancer, death, loss of sight, loss of loved ones, love, thoughts of the afterlife and shows vividly from one girls perspective what it may feel like to know you are dying. This book may not suit everyone, but if you don't have issues reading about those things I would recommend this book to you. It was quite depressing at times, but I'm sure you would know that just by reading the synopsis. 4.5/5 Stars ...more For people who haven't read this book yet... \u2022 Read the book first so you love the movie and connect more \u2022But always remember, Nothing ever lives up to an amazing book.' ~ Just a few weeks for the movie!!! :D :D :D :D ~ I wish they cast him, he's so pretty!!!

Warning, spoilers included! Is the Fault Really in Our Stars? Also, Meghan's follow up post: Augustus Waters: Hero or Zero? The first time I heard about The Fault In Our Stars was in a vlog by John Green, and my thoughts ran along the lines of: \"Oh, new book. Nice. Might check it out of the library.\" And that's that. It wasn't until the early shipping fiasco and the subsequent blog posts that I really considered seeking the book out to see if it was worth all the hype it got . Look, I like John Green alright, he has his own thing going on. And I admire him for creating a sense of community amongst nerds everywhere - it's not an easy feat, and it's nice to be made to feel great about who you are and what you do. But something bothered me about that vlog and the subsequent reactions of people to it. I didn't know what it was until last night... and I'll get to that in a minute. Anyways, The Fault in Our Stars tells the story of Hazel, who, after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer at 12, was ready to die, before a medical miracle saved her... for now. At Cancer Support Group, she meets Augustus, who is in remission after having lost his leg to osteosarcoma fourteen months prior. And while Hazel makes it her policy not to get too close to people for fear of hurting them when she dies, she can't help but to start falling for Augustus. Here's what I hand in to John Green: he knows how to write his dialogue. I had plenty of laugh out loud moments. And he's not pulling any punches - he doesn't prettify cancer. He doesn't make his characters out to be some perfect saints, he doesn't make them seem heroic. There's a lot that can be said about grief and grieving and the difference between the face you put on for people and what you really feel. That said, I don't feel like I should have sought this book out the way I did. My first thought, when reading the opening chapters, was something along the lines of: \"Oh, my God, John Green has written a manic pixie dream boy\". The trademark Green novel elements are here: a love interest that is just too perfect, quirky and smart characters, a secondary cast that is barely developed further than their function. Hazel's high school friend Kaitlyn has about three scenes in the book, in which she does nothing but direct our main character to helpful plot points. I didn't mind Augustus, although like many other readers have pointed out, he talks like he reads from a script. His pretentiousness, him tailoring his actions based on their metaphorical meaning - those traits of his irritated me to no end. I kept wondering \"Who talks like that?\" I get it that cancer kids are supposed to be precocious, but there are ways to make this seem plausible and organic and Green completely overlooked them. But ultimately, what pissed me off was the fact that the book gets so deep, and at the same time says absolutely nothing. Hazel and Augustus talk about death and whether it's better to live fully and leave scars, or to thread lightly and minimize the damage. (view spoiler) [ Hazel looks like she's finally conforming to the socially acceptable grieving processes, in spite of how much she insists she doesn't, while in the end, we discover that Gus, in fact, admires her greatly for denying herself the joys of a full life out of consideration for others. Which is kind of sad - so the guy gets to be selfish, but the girl is admired for her selflessness? (hide spoiler) ] I think what this book is about, in the end, is that human lives are governed by chance and coincidence. Peter Van Houten exclaims, at one point, how Shakespearean Gus and Hazel's tragedy is, and indeed, \"Romeo and Juliet\" would not have been quite so poignant if not for the horrible, horrible timing. My own timing of reading this book was bad - this past week has been very difficult for me and reading two cancer books would have ended up depressing me to no end. In the end, what TFIOS is telling us is that sucky timing exists... and that's that. Which brings me back to why I felt so uneasy about the hype surrounding this book. People will argue whether spoilers are good and bad and if Green has any right to ask people not to spoil his book (even if that limits discussion), (even if it sounds suspiciously like telling people how to review his book). I personally think people don't spoil books on purpose, and if someone does post huge spoilers on the Internet, the author telling them not to will not have an impact. (view spoiler) [ Also, not to give anything away, but the only consequence of revealing the plot to this book will only be a lessening of the tear-jerker effect. It's no Liar. (hide spoiler) ] But the reason why this bothered me is that... honestly... it's such a ridiculous thing to make a big deal of. Spoiling a book isn't some earth ending calamity, and there are certainly worse things to worry over. If this is John Green's biggest concern, then he's very lucky, very privileged indeed. He deserves his kudos and the respect of his fans. His credibility will not be questioned. He's not very likely to get cyber bullied, not as much as a female author/blogger might, and he certainly won't be discriminated over his race, nationality or sexuality. No, the only thing he can apparently crusade about is having a spoiler-free world. Well, bless him, then. I'm sure he's going to have fun with that. ...more What can I say about this amazing book that has not already been said a million times? It's real, heart-wrenching and so, so well written.
