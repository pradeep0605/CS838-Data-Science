On to big and better things... but before she goes, a bonfire of a few bad memories sounds like a good idea... until it isn't and things go boom! But before Lex and the gang are thrown behind bars and forced into tacky orange jumpsuits, she meets Officer God. Ford has this girl spinning all sorts of crazed fantasies as she is threatened with charges of arson and attempted murder. But in her defense, he's fuck hot and she is desperately out of sugar... <---A>Avery Aster</---A> can spin an erotic story into something sassy, snarky and all kinds of cray-cray hilarious. The one thing you know when you start a book from this author is that you will laugh. Stretching the canvas of Fiction taut as she writes. Lines are crossed, boundaries are pushed... her imagination should come with a flippin' warning label. This little novella gives you pretty much a day in the life of one of the fab-gals of The Manhattanites. And as Lex is forced to face the music, before all is set right, she meets the hunky officer that has her exchanging her desire for candy for something a bit harder...and bigger. Ford was a fun character that had you thinking sweet and dirty thoughts that might just get you out of your next speeding ticket. Although I would have loved to have seen their story go a little further, my heart was lost to the Prince a long time ago. This author is one of those that you just know is going to put a smile on your face when you pick up one of her books. Between the heavy panting and a bit of sweaty fun, this woman delivers humor in a major way. ...more I received this book for the exchange of an honest review.

The writing is sad, the characters drive me nuts, the plot is all over the place. In reality this should have 0 (on my blog, -7) stars, but that isn't an option here. The book begins with Alexandra Easton, or Lex, who is apparently so chubby that her boyfriend tells her she needs to lose weight before he dare have sex with her. lol. what. Okay, so this girl who is apparently going to Columbia in the fall and has movie star parents has a low enough self esteem to sit there and take this kind of emotional abuse. Alright, I guess. So then, when she's finally getting close to losing the weight necessary to lose her \"Lady V\" (virginity), she comes home, to find what? Her mom and boyfriend going at it. I guess after this her (whatever was left of her) self respect kicked in, and she decides to dump her boyfriend. Now comes the real kicker. After she breaks up with her boyfriend, for no real reason, she decides to burn a dress and some pictures in the bathroom OF A NEW YORK CITY PENTHOUSE. Clearly little Miss Columbia isn't as smart as we thought. Anyway, I guess her mom had 02 tanks around her house to help with her youth and beauty or some equivalent bullshit, and boom, her house blows up, and Lex and her friends are arrested. While she's getting arrested, by the way, she flirts with the cop. Because after a few weeks of trying, I was unable to finish the book, I figured I'd skip to the last few chapters to find out if the book had a chance of getting any better. Hint: it didn't, it turned into some sick version of mommy porn that no one should ever have to be subjected to reading. I'll tell you right now, don't read this book if you want your eyesight to work fully afterwards. The poor writing style combined with the way too out there plot and the most annoying characters on the planet manifests itself in this book, <+++>Love, Lex</+++>. Hopefully I am able to avoid all Avery Aster books in the process. This book is marked DNF, for did not finish. (Note: This is the first book in over 6 years I have not finished).

Despite, the absolute craziness, the quirky MC can be rather witty in her thoughts at times. ... initially! Some reviewers found humor here. Even in the initial chapters, I didn't find any of it funny. Instead, I found it entertaining in the way some people often find crazy bloopers with a kid wearing a banana costume cracking his ass after trying to take a leap from his roof to the pool. You don't laugh... You just watch the train wreck. The blurb mentions Rachel Van D. .......THIS IS NOT Rachel Van D's brand of SNL lol funny! No! Just no! From Quirky Crazy To Fucking Absurdly Weird The first part is crazy in a mildly entertaining way... 'Omg... 'Wtf' kinda way that's delivered with a healthy dose of snarky quirkiness. Then, around the time officer God makes his first appearance, this story takes a very wrong turn in an absurdly ridiculous way that makes me pity the keystrokes it took to write this mess. Btw how is Gotti shortened to God? Anyway... It quickly becomes nonsense for the sake of nonsense. The wet dreams that go on for pages upon pages were absurd and weird, not hot. The bike sex scene was absurd and weird, not hot. The HEA was weird and absurd, not swoony. The male mc was weird, not swoony. ...more Marie's Tempting Reads Review: Since I have read two books by Avery Aster, Undressed and Unscrupulous and enjoyed both, I knew I could NOT turn down an opportunity to read and review Love, Lex.

I can't say Marie's Tempting Reads Review: Since I have read two books by Avery Aster, Undressed and Unscrupulous and enjoyed both, I knew I could NOT turn down an opportunity to read and review Love, Lex. When I first was gifted with this beautiful box set, I first had to take a few moments to admire this yummy cover before flying to Avery Aster's story, Love, Lex. I found this story to be funny with plenty of snark, and with a GORGEOUS biker cop being involved, this just made it absolutely DELIC! I can't say I was fond of the whole drug use in the book, but since it contained a LOT of humor and a smokin' hot cop, I have to say it was easy to overlook the whole drug use thing..plus there wasn't an over abundance of it in the book which definitely helped. I really liked Lex. She is curvy, spirited, amusing, and just has such a strong loyalty to her friends and people she cares about. Now with sexy Officer Gotti, he was just the perfect male specimen. Sexy, charming, concerned, and dominating..*sigh* like I said, PERFECT. Lex and her friends reminded me of a mix between rich gang members and teenage Kardashians. They stick together and I totally dig that. I did NOT like how some of the people in the book considered Lex to be fat..WHAT?! I thought she was GORGEOUS just the way she was. I give Love, Lex a FOUR AND A HALF STARS OUT OF FIVE because of its humor, sexiness, panty melting sex, and one drool worthy cop. I can sum this book up in one word...YUM! If your looking for a laugh out loud, sexy read then I suggest you pick up this incredible box set and read Love, Lex..plus with many other fantastic books and one low price, you definitely can't go wrong. ...more Absolutely loved this book. It was fun to read. Gave some real insight to how these girls and Blake became so close. The drama was crazy, setting the penthouse on fire ha! The sex was hot and the friendship between the girls and Blake always fun to read. Avery Aster makes you feel like a part of this quirky group her writing just pulls me into the crazy. I still think this whole series needs to be a cable TV show :) I would totally watch. **CAUTION: SPOILERS AHEAD** Hi Happy Readers- I received this book as an ARC from the author this morning. I was so stoked to read it, I literally read it in a few hours. Holy Fuckity Shit Fuck, Batman! *FANS SELF* That was hot as hell! Please note that blames just might randomly start in your pants by reading this book. Literally CALIENTE! Before we get to the hotness- let me just comment on the Spice Girls and the Dawson's Creek omega reference that just made me swoon all over the fucking place. **CAUTION: SPOILERS AHEAD** Hi Happy Readers- I received this book as an ARC from the author this morning.

Before we get to the hotness- let me just comment on the Spice Girls and the Dawson's Creek omega reference that just made me swoon all over the fucking place. That was amazing balls! And made my mother fucking week. Avery Aster- you just made me a life long fan yo! OK- Enough! Excuse me as I leash my inner 7th grader and calm her the fuck down! She's calmed the fuck down but unfortunately, I, Melissa Ann, 29 year old woman am not so calmed in the nether regions. This book is insanely HOT HOT HOTTTTTTT! Like hose me down in the backyard because the fire alarm just went off in my pants. The story is pretty uniquely fucked up. We have our lovely curny (curvy and horny) rich girl, Lex. Its been a really long time since I read a great curny girl novel! :) Can I just stop to state that our heroin is a curvy girl and there is a Spice Girls reference in this book AND its fucking witty. You should be sold on getting the book already. BUT if you aren't- then proceed with the review. She on the cusp of her 18th birthday. She's going to get ready for her date with her high school weekend heart Kelle. And then she hears her mother going at it in the house. Thinks mother of it until she hears her boy friends voice. QUE QUE WHAT? Yea man- I didn't even see that one coming. So homegirl Lex is not well in the head. Proceeds to stare at her bf and her mum go at it like bunnies. Tis tre fucked up. PLUS she was planning on giving her V card aka Lady V to her bf soon. Yikes! You really felt for her. I do have to say that scene with the watching her bf and mom get it on went on a little too long for me and made me feel extremely uncomfortable. I was super antsy and wished for Lex to SNAP THE FUCK OUT OF IT and walk the fuck out. Because it was super le gross. Ew! * sigh * One would think well the bad part of this book already happened and I can't get any worse. Oh no boo boo! It does. Turns out Lex and her GBF, VBF and BBF end up getting pulled over by Ford, the hunky cop who sets his eyes on the prize. And the prize is Lex. But before that happens the gang goes to jail. It becomes a little touch and go there. Friends reveal disloyalty. Again- you feel for this curvy girl. Let's go back to Ford real quick. Oh Ford! *swoons* Buh bye Lady V. Hip hip HURRAY for Ford! He rescues our curny heroine and you just can't help but love the cop. The ending was pretty great. Almost perfect. Loved it. It wraps up the story well, leaves you wanting more- thus Undergrad Years #2. You did a good job Avery Aster! All in all, Love, Lex is amazingly naughty book that makes me want to relive my undergrad years with Lex as my BF4L (best friend for life)!

She comes home to find her mother having sex with her boyfriend Kelle.(Who is a Major ASS by the way, HATE him!) Little did she know that the best thing she ever did was to move on from the guy who made her feel so HORRIBLE, and UNATTRACTIVE. (So Glad she didn't end up giving her Lady V to him.)In a fit while moving out, she unknowingly blows up her mother's penthouse. This is how she meets officer Hottie, I mean Gotti or Ford. Even though Lex is in so much trouble, that doesn't stop her from having some serious fantasies about Officer Gotti. (Can you BLAME her?) He was so SWEET!! He made her feel Beautiful and Good about herself for the first time. LOVE him!!! Every Curvy Girl needs a Ford in her life. Will Lex's fantasies about officer Gotti become a reality? How will Lex get out of this whole Arson Mess? You will just have to read LOVE Lex and find out. If you are looking for a quick, fun read that is both HOT and Hilarious, then this is the book for you. The only negative thing I have to say about this book is it left me wanting more. I wanted to know more about what happened in Lex and Ford's relationship. Although, I LOVE Prince Masi, and I am happy Lex found her happy ever after, part of me is SAD that it wasn't with Ford. Thank you Avery Aster. I was not disappointed. I look forward to not only the rest of the Undergrad Series, but also the rest of the Manhattenites as well.

We know Lex Easton is a no holds bar and bull kind of gal in the big wide world of fashion, but what was she like before all the blood sweat and tears of becoming that world famous fashion designer? I am guessing Lex was probably born kicking and screaming that the world was going to know who she was. Always in the shadow of her famous parents she had to make sure she stood out! Coming home to a heartbreaking scena Are you a fan of the Manhattanites series? Then you going enjoy the Undergrad Years.

I am guessing Lex was probably born kicking and screaming that the world was going to know who she was. Always in the shadow of her famous parents she had to make sure she stood out! Coming home to a heartbreaking scenario, Lex packs her bags, deciding that her friends Taddy, Vive and Blake are the only people she can trust. But her plans are swiftly halted when an almost tragic accident puts Lex's mother in the hospital and she is the prime suspect. Read about how friendships are strained, parental bonds are questioned and how Lex fantasises about what she'd like to do with the hot motorcycle cop who has apprehended her. Pure naughtiness and tongue in cheek humour, the Avery Aster story telling we have all grown to love! A great story about a sassy young woman and a hot Harley riding cop! Loved it!! ...more I literally could not even get past the first chapter. The main character, Lex, who narrates the story, uses so much \"teen slang\" I got a headache and just wanted it to stop. Some slang, I understand, but this was absolutely ridiculous and unrealistic. Lex is supposed to be intelligent (reading at a college level at thirteen and all), but trying to read her stream of consciousness made her sound as smart as a block of cheese. Very disappointed since the plot seemed interesting. I really didn't think I could love the Manhattanites more but dangit if I've been proved wrong. I always liked Lex but now, I have a whole new respect for her. I admit, I thought her a bit flighty from previous reads but now I see her as the strong, amazing character that she really is. Taddy might be the one that seems to be the center but Lex is truly the heart of the Manhattanites. I am really looking forward to learning more about them all but yeah, Lex, I really adore! Love this short novella about Lex in the beginning! It defiantly captures the fiery sprit of her and her friends before THE MANHATTANITES! Nobody writes this splendid dialogue with engaging characters. Readers who crave a bit of spicy plot and a whole new level of erotic romance. You will not be disappointed!!!! Avery Aster is just a totally amazingly talented lady! I'm in love with her work and even though I like the Manhattanies books better this was amazing book too. It also gives a nice glimpse to Lex's past and helps me understand her more. I can't wait to read the other books in the undergrad series. And of course there is the one tiny fact that Officer Ford is totally HOT! Well let me just freaking say, hell yeah for this!! While Avery write a damn good tale, I find the books I've read we're way easier to understand with Lex's background... So I hope my review gets this rating up because hell yeah... Sigh.... hottie Gottie all the way! I love love loved it I love these BFF's and was good to find out how they all fit together :) it's a must read for sure can't wait to read the other ones DNF From the synopsis I thought I would be all over this, but for some reason it just didn't work for me. Stepping away from my usual New Adult books, reading Love, Lex by Avery Aster was a refreshing break and a humorous one at that. I feel I should star this book by saying The Undergrad Years series will NOT be for everyone. If you are offended by certain swear words of a vulgar nature, do not like hearing about drugs, drinking and 'exaggerated' antics of some rich young adults - this book is not for you.

I feel I should star this book by saying The Undergrad Years series will NOT be for everyone. If you are offended by certain swear words of a vulgar nature, do not like hearing about drugs, drinking and 'exaggerated' antics of some rich young adults - this book is not for you. However, if you like reading something thats over the top, crazy and has characters that literally jump off the page they are so bright they really are 3D, then I'd give this a go. It is likened to Gossip Girl, being the huge fan I was of GG I disagree or would say GG on some serious Acid. Lex is the child of 2 rock stars, so her upbringing hasn't been perfect and she's a little crazy. But with all that in mind and her crazy antics with her close friends she still managed to keep her 'Lady V' and not lose it yet. Still that was all going to change on her trip to Paris for her 18th birthday with her best friends and boyfriend, that was until she saw said boyfriend screwing her mothers brains out high as a kite and then accidentally setting fire to the apartment. As you can see, from the onset this book was going to be 'out there' and Avery Aster does not disappoint. I really loved the relationships with Lex and her friends, I admit I wasn't that warm to Vive, I found her a little (Ok A LOT) bit of a bitch, but I think there's a lot more going on there and we will find out about that when we get to her story. I did however love Taddy and Blake.. well every girl should have their gay best friend (Trust me, I know that for definite!). Ford was just, well HOT! I loved Lex's day dreams and the incident on the bike towards the end of the book, can I just say 'serious fan moment' I needed some cooling down! It made me chuckle Ford was likened to The Rock 'Dwayne Johnson' as I'm a huge Rock fan (And a closet WWE fan... shhhh) and made the book that much better I had someone to compare Ford too. Also, I loved that Lex was what I call a 'REAL WOMAN' she is super curvy and not perfect, I love reading books in that respect when the leading lady is like the majority of us out there! This book is very tongue in cheek, its not serious and the scenarios are very unlikely to happen. However, it is funny and amusing and kept me happy for the afternoon I read it in. I found it a fairly quick read too and am really looking forward to reading Yours Truly, Taddy shortly. I gave Love, Lex 4 stars because I loved it. It is what it is and as I said at the start of this book it won't appeal to everyone, but for those it does - I'm sure you will love it!

It sounded like Gossip Girl with a bit more pizzazz. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t live up to the expectation I was having. Love, Lex follows the story of Lex, who is desperate to lose her virginity to her boyfriend \u2014 only to find him fooling around with her mother. Later, while attempting to burn some old memories, Lex ends up blowing her mother\u2019s penthouse down and getting thrown into jail. Truthfully, I enjoyed the premise of it and I enjoyed the writing. It was witty and funny, which really added to the characterization of Lex. The concept and premise of the book was really interesting. Considering that this was a novella and only seven chapters long, it had pretty good content and was sufficient. What took away the enjoyment for me was sadly, the sex. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve read New Adult and had my two-off trial with Erotica so sex isn\u2019t essentially the issue. But Lex reeked of desperation. She was so thirsty for sex that it became an eventual turn off. For somebody who is still a virgin, she knows a lot about sex (not that it\u2019s a bad thing) and fantasizes a lot about it (and very quickly). The ending was alright for me, I kind of wanted more for Lex and felt that she deserved better. Is this a book for everyone? Maybe, maybe not. But it doesn\u2019t hurt for you to try. ...more I loved reading Avery Aster's The Manhattanites so reading The Undergrad Years was a no brainer for me.

I have a soft spot for Lex and getting into her head was freaking amazing. I love how she daydreams stuff during this story that she would never admit to anyone in real life. Her dirty mind of seduction was too funny to read and I will never look at a motorcycle cop the same way again!! The minute Lexie winked at Ford he grabbed your attention and never held back. The scene of the bike in his garage was amazing and would be an amazing way to celebrate any birthday!! Lex is such an amazing character that has been walked all over and watching her mature during this book was amazing and not just a pretty face. Like I said I am really looking forward to getting into the head of these characters when they are just starting to understand who they are as an adult. ...more Short and funny. Nothing special, but perfect for quick hot read. I'll be honest, I only made it about halfway through this book and I just couldn't do it. I couldn't turn another page, I could read even another word. I. Was. Done. I had to put it down because I totally checked out. This is my first and last book by Avery Aster. Sometimes I'll give an author another shot if I was a bit on the fence about the first novel that I read by them but I wasn't on the fence this time. I was over that fence and four states away. It did not go well. Unfortunately, this is I'll be honest, I only made it about halfway through this book and I just couldn't do it. I couldn't turn another page, I could read even another word. I. Was. Done. I had to put it down because I totally checked out. This is my first and last book by Avery Aster. Sometimes I'll give an author another shot if I was a bit on the fence about the first novel that I read by them but I wasn't on the fence this time. I was over that fence and four states away. It did not go well. Unfortunately, this is not going to be one of my gushing reviews. This one is going to be rough. The book is just all over the damn place. I couldn't keep up with what was happening ... it was like a tweaking hummingbird just flitting from one topic to the next. It caused a serious case of reading whiplash coupled with a healthy dose of disinterest. It reads almost as if it's a jumble of thoughts that weren't fully explored and with each disjointed sentence, you're just pulled further into this vortex of confusion. It sure as hell doesn't help that this book is written using the urban dictionary for every other word. Everything is in such heavy slang that was uper-cray (did I use that correctly?) and nothing was jelly (again, I don't know if this is the right context, I had to Google this shit to see what it meant), forreals (this has to be another language altogether). I just wanted to grab my Kindle and scream, \"SPEAK ENGLISH, I WANT TO READ YOU!!!\". Yes, I understand that the book is written from the POV of a 17 year old. Got it. But she sounds like a damn idiot. Maybe that is what the author is going for. Who the heck knows. But it helps if the reader can comprehend what in the hell is going on and in order to know what is going on, we need to be able to recognize more words than just a handful every couple of pages. I absolutely ABHORRED the main character, Lex. She is a self absorbed, neurotic teenager and the way she talks is what is wrong with this generation. I'm not that old and I remember using slang when I was growing up but at least you could still decipher the English language when we talked. She's also crass and immature. You should enjoy reading about people that are different than you, not get annoyed. Since I'm talking about characters, the whole beginning thing (I'm not giving away anything that isn't in the blurb or the first chapter) with the boyfriend was just asinine. So this dude is staying in a relationship with Lex but refusing to have sex with her because she's overweight. I call bullshit. No sexually active teenage boy is going to say no to sex when it is being offered up on a silver platter because a chick is ten pounds overweight and then go play hide-the-salami with her coked out, has-been mom. Give me a break. It's just not believable. There were also these news articles or statements, I'm not totally sure what they were at this point. Anyway, they were weird because they weren't needed and it drew your attention away from the story as you are trying to figure out why they are included. There were also this dream sequence that literally lasted page after page after page ... it was to the point where you forget that you're reading a dream. I don't know if that is what the author was going for and she was trying to show how off in Lala Land this girl was or what. Most authors of YA or New Adult books are in fact, well over the age that they are writing about. There's nothing wrong with that. But there is a problem when it feels like you're insulting that generation with over-usage of nonsensical terms and phrases. Our son is 13 years old and I've been to tons of school functions where hundreds of teenagers are and I've NEVER heard kids use this much slang and improper grammar. Ugh. I'll get off my soapbox. Let's just say that it was not the book for me. The truth of the matter is, if I had the option to give it no stars, that's what I would have done this time. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading New Adult romance novels (or any romance for that matter) and I most certainly will not be picking up another book by this author. Total miss for me. * I received this novel in exchange for an honest review * Check out more of my reviews at Little Miss Bookmark ! ...more I can honestly say it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve last laughed so hard whilst reading a book. The last time was with \u2018It\u2019s Got to be Perfect\u2019 by Haley Hill (which you should go and read right now). Avery Aster drew me into the story with her clever and witty writing and hilarious characters who you feel like are your own best friends by the end of the book. If you are looking for an angsty new adult read, then this isn\u2019t for you, but if you just want to sit down with a good, funny book for a fe I can honestly say it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve last laughed so hard whilst reading a book.

Avery Aster drew me into the story with her clever and witty writing and hilarious characters who you feel like are your own best friends by the end of the book. If you are looking for an angsty new adult read, then this isn\u2019t for you, but if you just want to sit down with a good, funny book for a few hours and are in need of a good laugh, then this is definitely a book I\u2019d recommend. Lex was honestly the most bonkers heroine I\u2019ve read of in a while, but even with her craziness I connected with her straight away, and after reading that her boyfriend told her she\u2019d have to lose some weight before he would sleep with her, and her trying her hardest by chewing nicotine gum like it was going out of business was what made me really feel for her, and want the best for her. But the best thing about her was that she didn\u2019t want sympathy or pity, she told the readers how she felt without putting on any masks, and then moved on. The storyline of her being arrested for arson was done in such a brilliant funny way, especially when the story was told to us from Lex\u2019s viewpoint, complete with hilarious acronyms for her best friends (BFF, GFF, GBF, I\u2019ll let you read to find out what the last two stand for) and her complicated relationship with her famous rocker mother (You\u2019ll see what I mean within the first few pages), it really was a light escape to read about. Of course no story is complete without a sexy male, and Officer Gotti fit that role perfectly. This was a crazy story which made me laugh out loud throughout. The main characters were a new definition of crazy, but the fact that they stood by each other in times of crisis helped make the story a little more relatable to the reader and show the seriousness of their situation despite the way they try to cover their feelings with humour and sarcasm. This book was clever, witty, bonkers and just such good fun. If you don\u2019t mind a little over-the-top drama, and some crazy characters, but ones that you really connect with, then this story is the one for you. 4 Stars! ...more Birthdays are meant to be celebrated in style.

Hell yeah, where do I sign up!!!!! Her characters are hilarious and always seem to have the best commentaries in their heads. Full on conversation and day dreams that you just know somehow they are going to slip up. This book was no different except it takes place when the girls are still young which in my opinion makes it even funnier because I now know they have always been crazy. I can't wait for the next book. ...more When I read Undressed I instantly loved Lex.
