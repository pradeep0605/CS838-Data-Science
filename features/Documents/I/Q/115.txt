This book was fantastic and really did it for me. I loved it, all 1000+ pages, and I wouldn\u2019t have minded if it was considerably longer ( TWSS ). After more than loving The Pillars of the Earth ( that\u2019s right, I lurved it ), I had tall hopes for this sorta sequel and let me tell you it was more than up to the task. I was parched and hungry for a good meaty read. Well consider me gorged and my story thirst completely slaked. Now before I continue operation lick-spittle on Mr. Follett for his 2nd delightfully voluptuous epic, let me shine some context on this review so it will better help you decide whether this book is right for you: 1. As I mentioned above, I thought The Pillars of the Earth was pure, uncut awesome I my satisfaction gauge red-lined while I was reading it. If you had similar feelings for Pillars , than <+++>World Without End</+++> is going to make you happier than\u2026 Alternatively, if (heaven forbid) you thought Pillars was a Meh-filled bore fest or it just didn\u2019t push your joy buzzer, I see no reason why this book will be any different as the books are almost identical in tone and structure. Thus, you might look want to go elsewhere. 2. Assuming you haven\u2019t read Pillars (which is certainly not a prerequisite for this book), if you get through the first 100 pages or so and find yourself anxious for \u201csomething\u201d to happen, again this may not be your kind of book. In my opinion, the book should grab you roughly and carry you away and if that doesn\u2019t happen or if you find yourself disconnected from the characters, then this could be a real slog for you. 3. I listened to the unabridged audiobook (all 45+ hours of it) read by the incomparable John Lee (who also narrated Pillars ). John\u2019s narration is masterful and definitely enhanced my happy with the story. I don\u2019t know if I would have had quite the level of appreciation, but for John\u2019s involvement. If you are a fan of audio books, I would highly recommend this one (or anything else read by John Lee). Okay, I just wanted to get that out there, because the rest of the review is pretty much a <---A>Ken Follett</---A>, fanBOYatic extravaganza \u2026so let the man-crushing begin: This story is prodigious, sprawling and more addictive than caramel-covered crack. This is big, bad historical soap opera at its full on finest complete with everything that makes a great period piece: politics, intrigue, alliances, betrayals, fortunes won and lost, life-long grudges, loves, jealousies, deaths, plot-twists, unspeakable crimes (e.g.<---F>, rapes, murders, etc</---F>.), conflict between major powers, reformers versus status quo, good vs. evil and a mysterious letter the contents of which could shake the foundations of the Monarchy itself. Boo Yah!!! Set approximately 200 years after the events of The Pillars of the Earth in the same fictional town of Kingsbridge, England, this story is set against the backdrop of, and incorporates into its narrative, the beginning of the Hundred Years War and the outbreak and spread of the Black Plague. These events intersect with the lives of the inhabitants of Kingsbridge in significant ways and Follett does an amazing job painting a credible and highly entertaining portrait of life during the period. Follett introduces and weaves into his vast tapestry dozens of well-drawn, intriguing figures who each play a critical role in the outcome of the epic. However, the narrative flow centers primarily on the lives of four key people. The first of these is <---C>Caris</---C> , a strong, intelligent, enlightened woman who is the primary proponent for change in Kingsbridge and the main enemy of the old guard \u201cstatus quo\u201d represented by the Kingsbridge monastery and Prior Godwyn. Caris strongly desires to be a healer and treat the sick at a time when only men may be physicians and the remedies supported by the Church are as bad as the illnesses they seek to cure. Caris is out to change that. Merthin is a smart, extremely talented architect whose innovative and radical designs are instrumental throughout the story. Merthin and Caris are deeply in love but events and their own personal integrity constantly conspire to keep them apart. Next is Gwenda who is a favorite character of mine. Gwenda suffers more unimaginable heartache and grief than any other character in the story and yet remains unbowed by what life throws at her. Sold by her destitute father for a cow (yes, a cow), Gwenda finds herself on her own early in life and ends up thriving through her wits and huge reserves of inner strength. She goes through some horrendous events as part of the story. Finally, we have Ralph , Merthin\u2019s younger, stronger brother and main (though by no means only) villain of the story. A rapist, a sadist and a murderer, Ralph is as devoid of empathy as it is possible to be. He is the Lord of Scumbaggery and the epitome of callousness and abject cruelty. Some of the things he does throughout the story are truly shocking and get worse as he gains more and more influence. On a side note\u2026how cool is it to have a main nemesis named\u2026.RALPH. Joining the above is a stellar cast of supporting characters that all engaging and complex. Follett has a real knack for showing us villains through there own eyes and making them seem more human\u2026and thus all the more evil. As for the writing itself, Follett really gets the hat tip from me on this point. Not for its poetry or majestic beauty though I thought his prose was excellent. Rather for its incredibly engaging, breezy readability. Despite being over 1000 pages long and having almost the whole story take place in a single small town, I was hooked from the very beginning and never had a moment in which my attention wanted to stray. Follett\u2019s prose is like a strong but gentle current that just picks you up and carries you through the story until you eventually reach the end and realize how very far you\u2019ve traveled. It was a greatly impressive feat. <+++>World Without End</+++> is sublimely entertaining and I have rarely been this completely snatched and cloistered inside its narrative as I was from the very outset of this. I don\u2019t know that I liked this quite as much as The Pillars of the Earth , but that\u2019s trying to discern gnat crap from pepper and is due completely to the fact that I read Pillars first. Given how similarly both books are structured it makes sense that this one wouldn\u2019t feel as fresh and new. That said, Mr. Follett\u2026PLEASE don\u2019t go messing with the formula because it is working like a charm. This is quintessential story-telling and a masterful piece of historical fiction. More please!!! 5.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION. ...more This \"companion\" novel to Follett's 1989 classic The Pillars of the Earth is set in the same community, 200 years later.

Instead of Aliena, we get Caris (who I wanted to slap several times during the course of the story). Instead of Big Villain William, we get Ralph, Merthin's knightly (but less-than chivalrous) brother. And a bridge-building project stands in for the cathedral construction of the first book... As if anything could. The only character I found remotely original was the first one we meet in the book, a little girl reduced to pickpocketing by her starving parents, who grows up to be hopelessly in love with a handsome, honest young farmer. I missed Prior Philip, from the original book, who was a character who at least had some integrity and depth to him. All the clergy in \"World Without End\" seemed to be corrupt - including the ones we're supposed to like. Something big happens about halfway through, to change the book's course - and it doesn't get resolved as quickly as I thought it would - but the big payoff from the opening scene never materializes. (\"That's IT?\" I wanted to say when I read the explanation of what happened.) There are some good scenes, showing how war and pestilence affect ordinary folk - but the \"heroes\" in this book talk and think too much like people from the 21st Century to make the setting really believable. If you loved \"Pillars\", you might as well try this one, but it's not any great shakes. ...more In all practical theory, this book should be on my 'Sucked' shelf.

It hasn't got much to do with it's predecessor The Pillars of the Earth , except that it's in the same location 200 years later, with characters that are \"descendants\" of the Pillars characters. There's none of the complex building and architectural aspects found in Pillars, the graphic sex and violence has been toned down, several aspects of the plot are predictable, and the dialogue seems strikingly modern for a novel set in the 14th century. So, why is this book not on my 'Sucked' shelf? ... Because it KICKED ASS. With all of the above-mentioned problems in the book, it takes on hell of an author to pull off this kind of novel. Kenn Follett just plain rules. The story goes at a breakneck pace, the descriptions of the feudal system are fascinating, and the characters are complex and multi-faceted. For every (small) predictable plot twist, there are a million little shockers, and at the end, there are a few questions about the truth lingering. Frickin great. I also found Follett's descriptions of the complete powerlessness of women and the ultimate authority of the nobles described with total intensity, and they are displayed over and over again through the stories of the characters. Equally interesting were the power struggles between the church, the people, and the nobility. Conflict everywhere! Love it! Another great aspect of this book was the concentration on Medieval ideas about health and medicine, especially during the time of the plague. Given that monks are the only physicians, the best cures are blood-letting and applying goat-shit to open wounds to form a \"healthy\" pus. If you sit closer to the altar in the church hospital, you'll heal faster. [Although slight scientific advances are made in the book, the lingering affects of the church's bogus medical ideas seem to have transcended the centuries to live on in modern Italy: cover your stomach to avoid catching a cold, wait 3 hours after eating before you swim or you'll drown, sunflower oil is good for the flu, humidity causes low blood pressure, and canker sores are caused by indigestion. A complete aversion to all forms of medicine are also fundamental in this society. (i.e. Yesterday my French friend Sandrine had a headache. Italians don't like to take Aspirin because it will \"destroy your liver,\" but Sandrine is French and has no problem with taking meds, so I offered her an Aleve. \"If you don't want medicine, be Italian and kiss this,\" I said to her, holding up my pocket-rosary.)] Anyway, great book, totally fascinating, very different from Pillars of the Earth , and written by a guy who truly is a master writer. KICKED ASS. ...more Set two centuries after Pillars of the Earth, the people of Kingsbridge are at it again.

So, I fell into a trap with this one. After devouring Dinocalypse Now in a morning, my girlfriend asked if I managed to read an entire book in four hours. I said I had and she slammed me with this, saying it shouldn't take me more than a few days. Sighing, before I knew it, I was engrossed and asking her if Ralph was going to be the asshole rapist bully in this one. I still hate that Will Hamleigh! Much like Pillars of the Earth, World Without End follows the lives of a number of characters; Merthin the carpenter, his brother Ralph the squire, a poor girl named Gwenda, Wulfric the laborer, Godwyn the monk, and several others. As I predicted, Ralph was the asshole rapist of the book. What a nun mugger that guy was! As with Pillars of the Earth, twists abound and the 14th century is not a good place to be a woman. Hell, it doesn't sound like that great of a place to be a man either, but the women get the short end of the stick for the most part. There's just as much scheming as in the first book and just as many people making decisions that would later bite them in the ass. While World Without End happens years later, it very much picks up the style and flavor of The Pillars of the Earth . So much that it's very nearly the same book with slightly different characters. As near as I can tell, Follett's master plot generator goes something like this: 1. Things are going good 2. A problem arises 3. Problem solved, leading to unforeseen results 4. Goto 1 It's still a fun read that messes with your emotions but some of the magic is gone once you catch the rhythm of the plot. Kind of like how M. Night Shyamalan's movies aren't as fun once you start trying to figure out what the big twist is going to be as soon as the movie starts. It was exhausting to read at times, not because of the prose, which is breezy and accessible, but because of plot twists every 6.5 pages. It doesn't really build toward anything besides the next iteration of the good guys getting screwed over and the bad guys having good things happen to them. Since it's hard to review a book of this size without revealing too much, here are some closing points: 1. The late 1300's were just as rape-y as the 1100's of the first book. 2. I wanted to smack Merthin silly. Then again, we men tend to do stupid things when sex is on the table. Or bed, floor, car hood, etc... 3. Godwyn, though one of the good guys at the beginning, is still a tool. 4. Accusing women of being a witch is some serious shit. 5. Ken Follett and George R.R. Martin both went to the school of screwing over characters as much as possible. 6. Getting flayed would suck. 7. The blurb mentions the Black Death but it doesn't make an appearance until after the halfway mark. 8. Every time someone mentioned the bishop, I thought of a certain Monty Python sketch. 9. My favorite line was \"Sleeping next to her was like lying with a dead cow.\" Three stars. I think I'm Folletted out for the time being. ...more Follett finally completed the sequel to his evergreen historical novel, The Pillars of the Earth , and although I was compelled by the story enough to read all 1024 pages in a week, I was saddened at how poorly the book compares with its predecessor. It is interesting to consider the nearly 20 years between the first book and this sequel. Many things have changed in our culture since then, leading Follett to inject even more egregious anachronisms into this book than the first. For example, the ch Follett finally completed the sequel to his evergreen historical novel, The Pillars of the Earth , and although I was compelled by the story enough to read all 1024 pages in a week, I was saddened at how poorly the book compares with its predecessor. It is interesting to consider the nearly 20 years between the first book and this sequel. Many things have changed in our culture since then, leading Follett to inject even more egregious anachronisms into this book than the first. For example, the characters at one point fret over the self-esteem of a teenage girl. There are many further examples but I will spare you. More telling is the apparent shift Follett has undergone in what he believes we want to read about. For example, the first book avoided homosexuality, despite the many opportunities to explore it in a monastery. The second, now twenty years deeper into the gay rights movement, explores gay relationships with a frank openness more consistent with San Francisco circa 2000 than the Britain of the 1300s. I am most personally disappointed that the author did not again craft a thoughtful and multi-dimensional portrayal of a man of faith. The character of Prior Philip stands as the hallmark achievement of the first novel. Prior Philip was a man filled with the desire to do what is right by God and by his fellowmen but sometimes unable to know what would be right and what cost was worth bearing to do it. This is my personal experience of what most spiritual leaders are like. In contrast, the religious figures in the sequel are all one-dimensional sycophants or toadies, ingratiating themselves with higher ups for their own personal gratification, betraying their own principles regularly, and considering faith a stepping stone rather than an end in itself. The one sympathetic, intelligent, and thoughtful religious character is a woman who is technically an athiest, and only joined a convent to avoid being tried as a witch. She is consistently smarter and more capable than all other religious figures and her athiesm is continually cited as the engine behind her industriousness and her unique interpersonal gifts. I've met athiests like that, but I've also met religious people like that and you'd think that a novel that spans fifty years of religious life in a town where all activity centers on a cathedral might include even one intelligent, sincere devout person? Just one? The differences between these two books tells us much about ourselves and the kinds of things authors and editors believe we want to read. I wonder what a third book, written 20 years from now, would say about us? ...more Well, Pillars of the Earth is one of my favorite books and I was looking forward to completely enjoying this without reservation. But way back when it first came out, I stumbled onto an online discussion that cited a passage with anachronistic vocabulary, which bothered me. It was very anachronistic. So it was a single passage, but it added some reservation to my anticipated complete enjoyment. And then I got to page 15, and there's this conversation that no two people would ever have under any Well, Pillars of the Earth is one of my favorite books and I was looking forward to completely enjoying this without reservation. But way back when it first came out, I stumbled onto an online discussion that cited a passage with anachronistic vocabulary, which bothered me. It was very anachronistic. So it was a single passage, but it added some reservation to my anticipated complete enjoyment. And then I got to page 15, and there's this conversation that no two people would ever have under any circumstances that served only for the author to show off some detail about the time period. That doesn't bode well, at least not on top of sloppy word choice. Finally, there's a character in this book that might as well be a character from Pillars , which makes me worry that other character types will be recycled. PLUS there's a major plot point hinged on the kind of intrigue that drove the motivations of some characters in Pillars --derivative! derivative! So I have four things in my conscience mind to have to suppress as I am reading. Fortunately, I have been able to do so, at least through the first part of the book. I am sad that people who are sort of shabby and bumbling are the descendants of people who were just fantastic in Pillars , but I accept that family fortunes rise and fall. I think it will color my feelings about those Pillars characters next time I read the book, but not necessarily my feelings about the book. UPDATE APRIL 5: Uh-oh. I had really hoped the Great Mumbo Jumbo Kerfuffle of Aught-Seven was an anomaly, but I just encountered the word \"sexy\" in a character's thoughts and I'm not even at page 100 yet. Is two a pattern? UPDATE April 12: The book tanks. It becomes extraordinarily boring around the plague and then it just doesn't pick up again. The second half of the book is like a checklist of all the social changes that the plague triggers. The characters turn into mirror images of the characters in Pillars , and some of them in that book were a little silly. The final scene between Gwenda and Annet is just goofy; there is a rebellious teenage girl running around with a bad crowd; I skimmed the last 200 pages while fooling around in a chat room. I will forget I have read this book. I was sad for a while to see what became of Jack and Aliena's descendants, but it doesn't matter. The book is inconsequential. Also lesbian nun sex. ...more The Pillars of the Earth was pretty good, but WWE is supposed to be a sequel... However, WWE seems to be a 1000 page snorefest after the first book. Perhaps if I had read them 18 years apart... then I would not have minded that WWE is a plagiarized (by the same author) copy of TPOTE. They have the same plot, same polar characters (no one is reasonable, they are all so totally overboard in every description), same activities, same cads, same villians, same love story...

If you wait 18 years, the book might seem fresh instead of boring, annoying, unoriginal and tedious. I kept wanting people to die just so I would not have to read another word about them. If I did not have this incessant need to complete books, I would have just thrown it on the floor and never picked it up again. It makes me annoyed every time I pick it up.. sad but true. my hint: Read Pillars of the Earth, take a LONG break and then, if you feel a desperate need... think about it, and if you can find the book for cheap, maybe... perhaps... read it if you have absolutely nothing better to do. ...more World Without End , a follow-up to Ken Follett\u2019s surprise bestseller Pillars of the Earth , steals a page from the Bill & Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventure playbook.

A motley collection of insipid characters \u2013 if possible, even stupider and less realistic than Bill & Ted \u2013 get into a time machine and travel back to year 1327 and the village of Kingsbridge\u2026 Wait. Oh, wait. There are no time machines? The characters in World Without End are supposed to represent actual people from the 14th century? Well. I read Pillars of the Earth as something of a lark. For one, I enjoy grandly ambitious, watermelon-sized novels, packed with blood and strife and minutely-detailed, anatomically precise sex scenes. I love excess \u2013 all the better to feel lost in a different world. I was also a fan of Follett\u2019s earlier thrillers, which relied on precision plots, tissue thin characters, and yes, lots of sex, to tell crackerjack stories. Eye of the Needle and The Key to Rebecca are marvelously quick reads; meanwhile, the explicit hand-jobs detailed in Night Over Water turned me into a man almost overnight. In that mindset, I was able to enjoy Follett\u2019s foray into the realm of historical fiction, a tenuous place where copious research often rests uneasily with under-drawn characters. I felt that Pillars of the Earth had many problems. It was poorly paced, the dialogue was robotic, the characters were plot-pawns, and anyone paying the least bit of attention knew exactly how every minor and major mystery was going to be resolved. Still, there was enjoyment to be had in the research that Follett crammed into every page, from the composition of the bread, to the building of a cathedral. There was also a great deal of unintentional hilarity, much of it spawning from Follett\u2019s obsession with his characters\u2019 pubic hair. World Without End is a sequel in spirit to that earlier novel. It shares the same town \u2013 Kingsbridge \u2013 but none of the same characters. Reading one book is not required to understand the other. World Without End also shares many of the faults of Pillars of the Earth . It is, in other words, just as horrible. But for whatever reason \u2013 bad mood, fit of pique, utter irrationality \u2013 I have decided that I hate World Without End . Oh, it still gave me some laughs, just like the first one; this time, though, I\u2019m not giving it the stars. And yes, I realize that any criticism of World Without End or Ken Follett is like whizzing into the ocean. The man is Teflon-coated and critic-proof; if he ever feels bad about the criticism leveled against him, he has millions of dollars with which to dry his leaking eyes. I certainly don\u2019t bear him any malice. I will continue to read his books. Indeed, I have already started the next book in a proposed trilogy, Fall of Giants . It just needs to be said that this book is awful, in every way a book can be awful. I should say something about the plot: there is no plot. Well, that\u2019s not quite accurate. To be more precise, this book has an Alphabet Plot. This is a phrase I invented to describe a book that resembles \u2013 more than anything else \u2013 the 300 meter hurdles. It starts with the \u201cA\u201d story, resolves that, moves on to the \u201cB\u201d story, resolves that, moves onto the \u201cC\u201d story, resolves that, and etc, etc. Right up until the last page, Follett sticks to this simple formula: (1) introduce a difficulty for his characters to overcome; (2) have them despair; (3) have them come up with a plan; (4) the plan works!; (5) the characters believe (stupidly, it turns out) that all is right with the world; and (6) a new difficulty arises for the characters to overcome\u2026 This pattern is so distinct, so telegraphed, that it doesn\u2019t take you long before you can foresee the problem and the solution before either are introduced by the author. Follett tries to give this shaggy storyline some coherence by creating a bookend mystery to overlay all the other happenings. The novel actually begins with the main characters as children, out playing in the woods. On All Hallows Day, these kids witness a brutal fight that leaves two men dead and one man wounded. The cause and the consequences of this moment \u201clingers\u201d over all the events of the next 900 pages. And by lingers, I mean that Follett sometimes refers to it. The problem with this framing device is that the initial mystery is not mystifying; that you forget about it almost as soon as it happens; that the payoff comes too late; and that the payoff is underwhelming. Actually, underwhelming is not the right word. The word I\u2019m looking for is nonexistent. Yes, that\u2019s better. The payoff is nonexistent. Thus, you have an essentially plot-less book, with no real through-line, that follows a collection of cardboard cutouts characters from 1327 to 1361. If I were being charitable, I could almost dub this a multi-faceted bildungsroman that follows Follett\u2019s creations from childhood to adulthood. Of course, in the typical bildungsroman, the characters change and grow in some way. In this book, however, the characters are not even human: they are medieval robots who lack personality, charisma, charm, and anything resembling the human spark. The center of Follett\u2019s novel is a young woman named Caris. She is your typical 21st century girl. She is smart, outspoken, ambitious, and wants to become a doctor. In other words, the exact opposite of what she is supposed to be: an English peasant girl. In all seriousness, though, I give Follett a lot of credit in his intent. He isn\u2019t an author to create token female characters. Quite often, he puts women front-and-center in his novels. And these are the type of women we \u2013 in the 21st century \u2013 want our daughters to be: competent and take-charge; independent; smart; willful; and driven. Far be it for me to mock Follett for this, when so many authors and film directors treat women as adornments. Still, Follett has a serious subtlety problem that undermines everything that Caris is supposed to be. I will take it as a given that Caris, as the heroine of a 1,000 page novel, might be an outlier; that is, atypical from the other Middle Aged peasant stock. But if you are going to get me to accept that conceit, you have to show me that it is deserved. Here, Caris is just a transplant from a different millennium. She defies religious authority, she doesn\u2019t want to get married, she runs her own business, she dabbles in situational-homosexuality, and she discovers the germ theory of medicine (!). It all becomes a bit much, especially since Follett isn\u2019t able to make me believe a single thing. He tells us that Caris is smart, all right, but he isn\u2019t able to show it. For instance, here is a typical bit of dialogue: SILLY PEASANT: I don\u2019t know how to solve this problem. CARIS: It\u2019s simple. You just need to do this obvious thing, this obvious thing, and this obvious thing. SILLY PEASANT: You might be a woman\u2026but you are a genius! ME: No! You\u2019re both idiots! Good luck with the bubonic plague, jackasses. Okay, so I made that up. But you get the point. As you might have guessed, Caris is a Good Guy, as opposed to a Bad Guy. For those of you who appreciate streamlined storytelling, there is no Ambiguous Guy. Caris is in love with Merthin. Merthin is a builder-savant. Even though he has never had any formal training, he knows everything there ever was about architecture. He loves Caris, but is upset because she doesn\u2019t want to get married (\u201cmarriage is so 12th century\u201d). The biggest problem with this, the central romantic relationship of the novel, is that Caris and Merthin actually seem to hate each other most of the time. They are just like the couple in NBC\u2019s execrable sitcom Whitney . Despite the fact that they are always fighting, and despite the fact that their worldviews are completely inapposite, we are asked demanded to accept their fairy tale romance. There are several bad guys in this book. Some of them are dispatched quite early; others have to wait for their comeuppance. Spoiler alert: all the bad guys eventually get their comeuppance. If this surprises you, please contact me for some investment opportunities that I am making up as we speak. The chief Black Hat of Ye Old Novel is Ralph. Now, there will certainly be times in World Without End when you will get characters confused. This is because they are all the same; which is to say, they\u2019re all one-dimensional wisps of smoke with names and occupations. To this day, I cannot tell you the difference between Elfric and Wulfric. Ralph is different, though. You will remember Ralph because of this mnemonic device I am giving you now: Rapey Ralph. Ralph, you see, likes to rape. And when he is not raping, he is thinking about rape. Every time Ralph meets another female, Follett digs deep into his psychology to describe precisely the dirty thoughts that Ralph is having. And Ralph is not discerning. When he sees a chubby girl, it turns him on, and when he sees a skinny girl, it turns him on, and when he sees an older woman, it turns him on\u2026and you get the point. In short, the character of Ralph was written by a 13 year-old boy who is approximately fifteen years away from ever talking to a woman. I refuse to call Ralph an avatar of anything, yet he is emblematic of a strong rape fetish that courses through World Without End like poison in the bloodstream. Fetishes turn up a lot in Follett novels. As I mentioned above, Pillars of the Earth was marked by its detailed descriptions of pubic hair, and the way Follett\u2019s characters obsessed over their hirsuteness. This was hilarious for many reasons, but mainly because people in the Middle Ages were engaged in a minute-to-minute struggle not to scratch themselves on the arm and die of a raging infection. I\u2019m guessing that bikini waxing and body-scaping were low on their list of concerns. Here, the fetish is rape, and this is less funny. Rather, it\u2019s not funny at all, except in the way that you laugh when something utterly ridiculous appears before your eyes. Rapey Ralph and his rape-dreams are pretty low. Things get even worse when Gwendolyn, who has \u201cthe look of a determined rodent,\u201d is raped by Ralph and begins to enjoy it. Also, this is the second time that Gwendolyn is raped. She also started to enjoy it the first time, before she stabbed the eyeballs out of her attacker. I wish I was making this up. Even if you can ignore the anachronisms, the lack of forward momentum, the rape fantasies, you cannot ignore the dialogue. The hardest part of writing a novel is dialogue; Follett seems to have recognized this, and decided not to try. His characters utter things that an American teenager would loathe to text. Most exchanges are purely expository, and almost all of them include idioms and phrasings that belong solely to our time, and not theirs. Follett couldn\u2019t have better undercut his own research and attempts at verisimilitude if he\u2019d tried. (And maybe he did try. Maybe this awful dialogue was part of a bet with his publisher. \u201cHey, I bet you that even if I write this s\u2014t, I\u2019ll still sell millions of books.\u201d If so, he won that bet). So yes, the dialogue sucks. Like I said, though, dialogue is hard. What about the prose? Well, the prose is\u2026 Let\u2019s just say that if you played a drinking game in which you took a shot every time you read a clich\u00e9 \u2013 \u201cshe burst into tears,\u201d for instance \u2013 you should definitely expect to vomit the next day. During the course of this disaster, Follett attempts to weave a couple big historical events into the mix. He has to, because this time around, there is no cathedral to build. The two marquee happenings are the Hundred Years\u2019 War and the Black Death. Of the two, neither are effectively utilized. The scenes of the Hundred Years\u2019 War, set in France and featuring Rapey Ralph and the battle of Crecy, are historically accurate but hopelessly dull. I\u2019m not sure why, but Follett seems incapable of epic-style storytelling. He does (relatively) well when he sticks to his central location of Kingsbridge. When he starts expanding the scope of his tale, however, he loses his sure-handed grasp of the material. The scenes set in France are inert and stage-bound. Even though he is an author, with no limits save his imagination, he writes his battle scenes as though he was on a budget. Follett is only marginally more successful with his usage of the Black Death. Admittedly, when the Plague first appears, it does so effectively, driving the plot in the required direction. After awhile, though, it becomes a deus ex machina: whenever Follett needs someone killed off, the Plague returns. Around page 800, I was actively hoping for the Black Death to finish off every last person, just so I could toss this book off a moving train and start fresh. I want to be clear that I do not hate this book. Hate is a strong word, and World Without End does not have the requisite content to create any real emotion. I bought this copy used for 1 cent, plus 4 dollars shipping. No one forced me to read it. I put it on my exercise bike and read 50 to 70 pages every time I worked out. It cost me $4.01 and helped me lose a couple pounds. Still, it\u2019s a piece of crap. The true and actual reason I started reading Pillars of the Earth and World Without End is simple: I had just finished George R.R. Martin\u2019s A Dance With Dragons and I needed a swords-and-sex fix to tide me over for the next decade, when Martin\u2019s next novel may (or may not) be released. In comparing Martin to Follett, I discovered a certain irony. Follett has devoted an enormous amount of time and effort into making his novels historically accurate. He has strived (and succeeded, largely) in getting all the small details right. You can read his novels and learn a lot about the Middle Ages \u2013 the feudal system, the way clothing was dyed, the way a bridge was constructed. Martin\u2019s books, on the other hand, exist in a land of his own creation. There are fire-breathing dragons, the Red God, decades-long winters, and White Walkers who implacably roam the Earth. Martin\u2019s novels are fantasies; they take place in a land that never existed. Yet, everything about Martin\u2019s Westeros feels real. And everything about Follett\u2019s England feels artificial. ...more \u03a3\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03bf Follett

The characters didn't seem real and certainly didn't elicit any sympathy from this reader as they moved from one contrived crisis to the next, the writing was repetitive and juvenile (a gifted high school student could write better), the language was too modern for the time period (\"shagged\" didn't come into use - at least in print - until late 18th C.) and sex was vulgar and gratuitous.

This was an enthralling sort of sequel to the The Pillars of the Earth . I say sort of because it is set some 200 years after the end of that wondrous story. Just as the previous novel looked at the building of the Cathedral and the growth of the fictional city of Kingsbridge* through the disastrous 19 year reign of King Stephen and beyond, this novel covers the forty years or so of the middle part of the 14th Century embracing most especially the horrendous catastrophe of the Bubonic Plague's arrival in Europe in which perhaps a third or more of Europe died a horrible death. The story centres around the lives of four young children who witness the killing of two men at arms who themselves had come to kill the young knight who turned the tables on them. From those deaths unfurl the long, long journey of the story which cleverly comes full circle right at the end of this huge work. A mysterious letter, buried by this young man, is pivotal to the story and, though it does not reappear fully until the end, punctuates the plot's every twist and turn like a hinted shadow or a glimpsed figure of menace. The four children grow from pre-adolescent exploring and friendship to middle age and all the accrued experiences. Caris, a young rich girl who is beautiful as well as wealthy but who is a natural leader, strikingly independant in thought, vision and action and is, if I may be so bold, a tad anachronistic. This does seem to be a theme for Follett. Certainly in the two novels which I have read and loved, the main female character is brilliant and strong and intelligent and insightful and therefore, whether people like it or not, not a very accurate outline of how a woman would have been able to be in the 14th Century. We might 100% agree with everything she says and does, or at least a good deal of it, but she speaks and reacts and behaves as a woman might well speak and react and behave in 2012 but most certainly not how she would in 1312. She is a great character but not of her time. Then we have Merthin, the great love of her life. Of lower gentry fallen on hard times. Should be of rich stock but incompetence by his father results in a lower standing. He becomes an Architect and Trailblazer and courageous man of honour and decency. Another visionary. His brother, Ralph, an unbelievably squalid shit. Cruel and vengeful and vicious and murderous and irredeemably awful and then we have Gwenda. She is the token peasant not quite the tart with the heart but every soap opera has to have the poor girl whose role is to be the best friend of the rich girl thus enabling aforesaid rich girl to take on another mantel, that of democratic liberal. This is to belittle Gwenda really as she is a brilliantly drawn and brave character and her struggles serve to mark momentous moments in the story and the ebb and flow of her life is one which really holds the reader's sympathy. Re-reading this it might sound as if i did not like the book. I did. It is excellent. A fantastically exciting story, enormously expansive in its canvas and has enough willthey/won't they moments and gasp-i-can't-believe-he/she/they/said/did/achieved that opportunities for plot development that you are swept along. However this volume, more than the first one I think, is a total Middle Ages Soap opera. I am not sneering at that; it is ridiculously addictive, hence my desire for a big traffic jam but this time the historical awkwardness jarred more. The language used, the opinions expressed...always by Caris and Merthin and sometimes by others of their allies....were not believable for people of the 14th century. Their middle class sensitivities and liberal attitudes are wonderful for middle class and liberal people living and working and falling in love in the 21st Century but though Caris may well have struggled with all sorts of things I felt she was struggling as would a 21st century women transferred by magic back to the 14th century. Her struggles were of a woman going to bed in 2012 Surrey and waking up in 1348, the Bobby Ewing shower scene in reverse. Follett again keeps 'plates' spinning brilliantly and draws characters with sharp lines so that you do not need to think much but know exactly who you are to boo and who you are to cheer. There was an oddly convenient use of the Black Death where his scythe seemed always to cut down the right people to ease the plot along and enable the main characters to progress. Only one central character died of it and indeed that was massively convenient and came at just the right time. Once again i am not criticizing for the sake of it but it does reinforce the idea of Soap Opera. In Emmerdale or 'Corrie' we will have a plane crash or a train pile up. In the pre-machine, pre-Industrial age of Medieaval Kingsbridge we will use the mightily convenient pandemic making sure only minor characters or certainly those whose usefulness to the plot is past or maybe they want to move on to do a season in Pantomime at Blackpool for the Christmas season. Anyway they will be the ones who 'buy it'. Things i found briliant were the ways Follett easily explains the development of social structures and the growth of industry and the discovery of different ways of weaving or dyeing or construction. I felt I was learning as i read without even realizing it. The development of surnames and titles and the beginnings of the loosening of the serf structure was fascinating. The political and ecclesiastical battles were cleverly hinted at. The hopelessness of the poor before the tyranny of the powerful was well expressed and the stagnating grip of the status quo was well illustrated. I felt myself groan with frustration along with Caris and Merthin even as I knew this was another anachronism. By this stage i didn't care. That is the power of Mr Follett, I recognize that he is manipulating and twisting reality to suit his story and characters but he did it so well that i was totally Team Caris. Each time Ralph did something monstrous, each time Godwin was an underhand shite, every time Philemon...who obviously smelt, Follett did not spell this out but i knew this had to be......just breathed I let all these occasions collect in my memory knowing they would surely all be avenged in some way shape or form. Well, all i will say is......I was not massively disappointed....Follett does a good plate of comeuppance and here he parts company with Soap opera cos he, quite evidently, believes in happy endings. *though I would point out that for threee years I lived just 10 miles from the small town called Kingsbridge which nestles in the beautiful area of the South Hams in Devon ...more When I had in my hands \u201cWorld without end\u201d I had a mixture of excitement and fear, I will explain it.

For me the Pillars of the Earth was and is one of my favourite books, I could say that is within my Top 5 favourite books, so when I first took \u201cWorld without end\u201d I had a great desire to know what Ken Follett wrote but also I was afraid that comparing to its precursor novel could disappoint me. I was wrong. \u201cWorld without end\u201d is an extraordinary book, and now I have to say that it competes with the position of the Pillars. In this second book, Follet makes a big temporary jump and presents a more evolved society with a fascinating female as its main character. I think the female character gives to the story a new point of view, a richness and completely new way of facing the problems of that time. I obviously recommend this novel to all readers of The Pillars of the Earth and I encourage to read these two epic stories to the rest who haven\u2019t done it yet because it\u2019s a story that you will remember for the rest of your life. Spanish version: Cuando tuve en mis manos \"Un mundo sin Fin\" senti una mezcla de emoci\u00f3n y de miedo, me explicar\u00e9. Para m\u00ed los Pilares de la Tierra es uno de mis libros favoritos, podr\u00eda decir que est\u00e1 dentro de mis Top 5 libros favoritos, as\u00ed que al coger el libro ten\u00eda unas ganas enormes por saber en qu\u00e9 historia me sumergir\u00eda Ken Follet como continuaci\u00f3n pero a la vez ten\u00eda miedo que compar\u00e1ndolo con su precursora me decepcionara. Pero mis dudas fueron infundadas. Un mundo sin fin es un libro extraordinario, y ahora tengo que decir que compite con el puesto de Los Pilares. En este segundo libro Follet nos hace da un salto temporal y nos presenta una sociedad m\u00e1s evolucionada y con un interesante personaje protagonista femenino. Y es aqu\u00ed donde creo que Follet dio en el clavo, creo que el cambio de sexo en su protagonista es lo que le da una riqueza y una manera de enfrentarse a los problemas totalmente nueva que sus personajes masculinos. Evidentemente recomiendo esta fant\u00e1stica novela a todos los lectores de Los Pilares de la Tierra y de Ken Follet y animo a qui\u00e9n no lo haya hecho a\u00fan a leer estas dos \u00e9picas historias que de bien seguro os dejar\u00e1n marcados para siempre. ...more This book is like the book before the Pillar of the Earth in that it is about the lives of three or four main characters throughout their lives of childhood through adulthood seen through their troubles and hopes every so often in the the city of Kingsbridge, two hundred years after.

It starts with two family, the family of Gwenda, who is poor and steals from Merthin and Ralph, making them without broke. It is a book that is epic with their struggle between the them along with other characters, in which some stands in their ways through the hate between certain characters by making lives bad. For example, not allowing things to be build or allowed land to be owned. Then halfway throughout the book turns to the problem of the Black Death of how it spreads across Europe. Also throughout the book, the men uses their dominates to get their sexual needs fulfilled. I would have give this book five stars, but does the book really has to end on a happy ending before the full life of the characters are seen? ...more \"...epic, historic novel\"??!

I thought it was almost perfect, in fact, except for one minor issue that I had with the dialogue sounding too modern for the time period (an issue I had with World Without End, too). After being engrossed in that book, loving, hating, caring about the characters in it, after feeling like I was living in Kingsbridge for 900 pages, I was excited for this follow up. I wanted more, I wanted to be back in that world, experiencing life right along with the people I was reading about, the people I cared about. So I picked this audiobook up and started it. And all was good... for a while. It didn't take me long to start feeling that something was wrong. It didn't take me long to start feeling like Follett had ripped off his own book. Maybe if I'd had 20 years to forget the details of Pillars before reading Book World Without End, maybe I wouldn't have felt the similarities as much, and I'd have liked it more. It isn't a BAD story, but I lost patience with it really quickly and then I stuck with it far longer than I should have hoping that it would come around. I made it 80%, and by the end, I couldn't tell you what happened, because I stopped listening. It was playing in the background while I worked, and I could hear it, but it wasn't holding my attention at all. I wanted more of Follett's Kingsbridge world, yes, but I didn't expect Pillars of the Earth: Now With New Character Names! I wanted a different story. Instead, I got a rehash of Pillars, and so I kept comparing them in my head. \"Oh, There's the devious, overbearing mother-plotter...\" \"Here's the Lord-Who-Thinks-He's-God...\" \"Another brilliantly talented at a really young age master craftsman... who woulda thunk it?\" and so on and so on... Did I like the characters? Yeah. Sure. I didn't care about them nearly as much as I cared about the Pillars characters though. Did I like the story? I guess. I did love the performance though. John Lee read this audio, and he was great. But still... I just endured this one, rather than enjoyed it, and couldn't bring myself to keep going another twelve hours to finish. Enough is enough. ...more A pretty darn good book - you laugh, you're horrified, the whole gamut - but what makes this a truly amazing \"read\" is the audio recording by John Lee, who is also the reader of Penguin Audio's recording of \"Pillars of the Earth.\" Both recordings are well worth the time commitment to listen to 30+ (unabridged) CD's - I walked around and drove everywhere with my headphones on listening to both of these amazing books. \"World Without End\" is a continuation of the Kingsbridge story begun in \"Pillars A pretty darn good book - you laugh, you're horrified, the whole gamut - but what makes this a truly amazing \"read\" is the audio recording by John Lee, who is also the reader of Penguin Audio's recording of \"Pillars of the Earth.\" Both recordings are well worth the time commitment to listen to 30+ (unabridged) CD's - I walked around and drove everywhere with my headphones on listening to both of these amazing books. \"World Without End\" is a continuation of the Kingsbridge story begun in \"Pillars of the Earth,\" this time ~200 years later, and while there are \"we, the reader, know the background\" references to past persons and events from \"Pillars,\" I don't think reading that book is necessary to enjoying \"WWE.\" That said, by all means read (or, better, listen) to both books - they're worth it. Ken Follett clearly is interested in the human condition and divides the world into Good Guys and Bad (really Bad) Guys, and the constant wars and jockeying between them. \"WWE\" admittedly retreads themes and plot devices that Mr. Follett uses in \"Pillars of the Earth,\" but who cares - he's really good at spinning tales. People come alive, vividly, through Mr. Lee's voice, and I'm constantly amazed at his ability to sort through so many people and have each person possess their own unique voice. Yes, the boxed audio set is pricey, but for those who love classic audio books, it's a good investment; or simply check it out from the library (what I did...). It helps to have at least some knowledge of the Plantagenet rulers and what was going on with British royalty at the time - perusal of Encyclopedia entries should do it. \"WWE\" takes place during the early and middle years of Edward III's reign. For an interesting historical novel take on events during the final year's of his long reign (1300's), I recommend \"Katherine\" by Anya Seton. ...more Follett es un misterio para m\u00ed, no s\u00e9 c\u00f3mo lo hace, como escribiendo libros de m\u00e1s de mil p\u00e1ginas, te mantiene interesado en todo momento y no te aburre, me agradan los libros largos, pero casi siempre me pasa que cuando estoy en una lectura extensa, de un momento a otro siento que me est\u00e1n metiendo relleno (muy al estilo de Naruto) y que el editor pudo haber hecho mejor su trabajo, pero me estoy yendo por las ramas, a lo nuestro.

Usted es diab\u00f3lico se\u00f1or Follett Hay dos formas de juzgar este libro, se lo puede hacer como un libro independiente o se lo puede comparar con Los pilares de la tierra. Es cierto que tiene muchas similitudes, aunque con cambios serios. Hay mucha construcci\u00f3n, Puentes, Torres, Hospitales\u2026, Personajes tan bien hechos, que parece que se pudieran palpar, realistas y muy humanos, una historia de amor imposible, luchas de poder, mucho drama y algo de comedia. Ame desde el principio a Merthin y a Caris , y como los shippeaba xD, me encanto la genialidad y la personalidad de Merthin (y lo apoye en todo momento), y que decir de Caris, tambi\u00e9n, me encanto, su inteligencia, su sentido del deber, su lucha personal en su mundo tan machista, aunque en muchos momentos no la entend\u00eda, y quer\u00eda meterme en el libro, zarandearla y decirle -\u00bfqu\u00e9 m\u00e1s quieres mujer?- Aunque por otro lado cuando pon\u00eda en su lugar a los monjes (idiotas y machistas en su mayor\u00eda) quer\u00eda decirle \u00a1bien hecho! Definitivamente ella es una de los mejores personajes femeninos de los que he tenido oportunidad de leer, y el hecho de que, como ya dije, en varias ocasiones no pod\u00eda entenderle, solo la hace m\u00e1s realista. Hay tambi\u00e9n otros personajes, como Gwenda , astuta como ella sola, aunque quiz\u00e1s sea la que pase por m\u00e1s penurias, Ralph el hermano de Merthin, que, en un mundo donde la mayor\u00eda de los personajes son grises (ni buenos, ni malos) \u00e9l est\u00e1 m\u00e1s cerca al negro, Godwyn y Philemon , como odie a estos desgraciados, uno representa la codicia del poder y el otro la pura mezquindad, y lo peor ambos se refugian en la iglesia, y son del pensar que todas sus acciones son buenas, no me molesta admitir que quer\u00eda que se murieran, (view spoiler) [cuando le hacen el juicio a Caris por bruja, mi odio fue tan grande, que si les hubiera ca\u00eddo un rayo en ese momento, fulmin\u00e1ndolos inmediatamente, hubiera dicho que era perfectamente l\u00f3gico y compatible con la trama. (hide spoiler) ] Hay muchos personajes y todos muy bien desarrollados, no los puedo detallar a todos porque la rese\u00f1a ser\u00eda interminable, pero mencionare a dos m\u00e1s, que aunque no son personas, se sienten en la trama casi todo el tiempo, la iglesia y la peste. En cuanto a la iglesia, no es un personaje nuevo para Follett, ya que en Los Pilares de la tierra ya era central en la trama, ahora sigue siendo central, pero se han pulido su bordes, ya no es tan perfecta como la conocimos antes, con todo parece m\u00e1s humana, seguimos teniendo juegos de poder con estrategias alucinantes, pero tambi\u00e9n vemos las relaciones personales que hay en el clero, amistad y a veces m\u00e1s que amistad, vemos como la bondad, inteligencia y ganas de modernizar se contraponen a los viejos h\u00e1bitos, la mezquindad, y la supersticiones. Y por \u00faltimo la peste, les dije que Follett era mal\u00e9volo, que peor desgracia que esta, la gran muerte, la perdici\u00f3n. \u00a1\u00d3rale! Esta rese\u00f1a me sali\u00f3 m\u00e1s larga de lo que pensaba, pero el libro es largo, se lo merece. Definitivamente lo recomiendo, ya sea si no conoces Los Pilares de la tierra o si eres fan, es una historia maravillosa, a\u00f1os pasan dentro del libro, pero a ti se te har\u00e1 corto y quedaras con ganas de m\u00e1s.

If you have recently read Pillars of the Earth, and liked it, I would strongly recommend you take some time before diving into this one, because it's a long haul. It is very much the same pacing, and a similar setting as its predecessor, so unless you're a very fast reader (I'm not), 2000+ pages of 1100-1369AD England may wear very thin for you.

I waited about ten years, and so was very ready to revisit the town of Kingsbridge. Like Pillars of the Earth, World Without End centers on a cast of characters and their lives set against the rule of the Church, Earls and knights. Unlike Pillars, the cast seems smaller than I remembered...the story follows two pairs of siblings, and their lives over thirty years or so, so this was great. Follett had less characters to spread out, and characterization was very nicely fleshed out. Although this novel for some reason took me a month to read (I read it on my Kindle, but I seem to remember looking at the book a while back and noticed it was 1000 pages of very small print. I guess that's why), in no way did the story drag. This is Follett's talent. He can sure draw out a story and make you care about these people. I felt their joy, I was outraged at the injustices they were forced to endure, and I was hopeful of things to turn out for the best for everyone and the town, and for the evil ones to get what was coming to them. Add in a dash of engineering lessons in building bridges and other structures and this makes for a fantastic read. The only issue I had was that for the last 80 pages or so it seemed to me that Follett was stalling to end it. Clearly he was vested in these characters. But it could very well be that after a month it was more a case of me getting antsy to move on to something else. When I started writing this review, I was set on rating it a solid 4. But, I am very impressed with his ability to maintain the fast pace of story for a thousand pages. So, really 4 and a bit, but I think I'll round up to 5 stars. ...more \u03a0\u03c1\u03cc\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1

Beginning two centuries after \"The Pillars of the Earth\" Oh, what a long read it was, but no regrets - the book is really good. I was fascinated reading The Pillars of the Earth and \"World Without End\" enchanted me from the first pages. \u201eWorld Without End\u201c is considered the sequel to \u201ePillars of the Earth\u201c, though none of the original characters reappear. However the descendants of the main family in \u201cPillars of the Earth\u201d gather to tell the new story about Kingsbridge and the people tied to it. Beginning two centuries after \"The Pillars of the Earth\" in the same town, this book has a lot of interesting characters and combines three decades of love, action, treason, history, corruption, difficult and adventurous life. The characters are so lively and real. This book marks the new era to Kingsbridge, the era of new ideas about medicine, commerce, architecture, and justice. Though the technical things slowed me a little bit. Also I found some repetition (comparing the first and the second books) which reduced my fangirlism in some way, like: two brothers- one good and one bad. The good one is a great builder, not a great fighter, he has difficulties to reach the popularity, but after some time abroad he becomes skilled and famous. The bad one gets a bad end of course. The life long love of the main character suffers some hardship and creates something new in business. There was much suffering, cruelty and injustice in the story so I couldn\u2019t help but hope that at some point it must get better for the good and worse for the bad ones - this is after all a novel. I liked that the story line had so much unpredictable things. The author skillfully combines the important far off catastrophes into his book, like the Great Famine, the Peasant's Revolt, the Black Death and Hundred Years War. The lives and the towns are changed forever. This book is not a history lesson about the fourteenth century, but a complex story about lives of ordinary people - their loves and losses, ups and downs, despair and suffering. It's a touching and cruel book, but the fourteenth century was a strange, cruel and dark time. And when I reached the last page, I knew that this is one of those books which I'll remember for a long time. I was spellbound by Mr. Follett\u2018s powerful vision of life in the Middle Ages. It is one more fascinating, mesmerizing and gripping book for me. I tried to watch the TV-series \"World Without End\", but for me it was a real meh and even a badly made interpretation of the book. Though I really liked \u201cPillars of the Earth\u201d screen adaptation. ...more I got this book for Christmas and was so excited to start. I was a big fan of Pillars and figured I would love this as well. I liked it a whole lot, but definitely not as much as Pillars. The story was familiar (and at points almost a retread of Pillars). It was often anachronistic - especially the character of Caris. I loved her and I'm all for feminism and strong female characters, but it made me wonder how accurate and believable she really was. Clunky prose such as \"she would have been alder I got this book for Christmas and was so excited to start. I was a big fan of Pillars and figured I would love this as well.

I loved her and I'm all for feminism and strong female characters, but it made me wonder how accurate and believable she really was. Clunky prose such as \"she would have been alderman, but women didn't usually hold that position\" didn't help matters. Nor the fact that Follet repeated that sentiment over and over again. Other reviews have correctly pointed out that there is something squirm-inducing about the way Follet seems to relish his descriptions of rape and pillage. He also has the annoying habit of annotating \"memories\" that the character has, so that every time he or she recalls something, he has to identify it for the reader and give the back-story again. It becomes laughably repetitive, and only goes to show that the book is way too long if he can't trust that the reader can follow along and remember. All in all, a good read, but definitely not one that I couldn't put down and not one that I loved as much as its predecessor. ...more World Without End is definitely not perfect-- it has a little too much in common with its predecessor, Pillars of the Earth, and its characters are too often painted only in black-and-white. Regardless of those flaws, I would probably give the book three stars if it weren't for one short plotline early in the book. Prior Phillip was one of my very favorite characters in Pillars of the Earth and his rise to the priorship was particularly enjoyable to read.

Prior Phillip was one of my very favorite characters in Pillars of the Earth and his rise to the priorship was particularly enjoyable to read. Despite my trepidation over familiar plots, I was happy to see this one repeated as Godwyn sought be elected as prior. The whole plotline was great- even as Godwyn was quickly shown to be no Philip 2.0. The election and the plot culminated in one great scene that is one of my very favorites from the two books. While World Without End is not as consistent as Pillars, there are a few other complete gems that more than make it more than worthwhile. ...more 5 EPIC STARS I didn't believe I would like this book as much as the first one, The Pillars of the Earth. But Mr Follett has created the most vivid characters that I laughed with, cried for and rejoiced in. Another amazing book! Another sweeping epic involving the village of Kingsbridge! Can't wait for the third in this trilogy to arrive (out some time this year!). For anyone interested in starting this trilogy, I would say that you are not required to read The Pillars of the Earth before reading this. Although they centre around the fictional town of Kingsbridge, they take place centuries apart, and very little knowledge from Pillars is needed for World Without End . I drew my own parallels while reading. Here's what I s Another sweeping epic involving the village of Kingsbridge! Can't wait for the third in this trilogy to arrive (out some time this year!). For anyone interested in starting this trilogy, I would say that you are not required to read The Pillars of the Earth before reading this. Although they centre around the fictional town of Kingsbridge, they take place centuries apart, and very little knowledge from Pillars is needed for World Without End . I drew my own parallels while reading. Here's what I saw: Fourteenth century life resembles twenty-first century life in many ways. Mainly, social hierarchy is structured in a similar manner. Usually men hold positions of power; poor people often remain poor and subservient to the ruling class, and the powerful often earn more wealth at the expense of the poor. \u007fI couldn't help but view Ralph to be very similar to Donald Trump in terms of his personality, his intelligence (or lack-thereof), and his style of rule. Throughout the tale, Ralph holds decade-long grudges against old rivals (Wulfric, namely) and even goes out of his way to ensure laws are created simply to punish this one man, with complete disregard of how it effects the rest of the people in the land. Sound familiar? He lacks emotional intelligence and is often outwitted by the people around him (Caris - a woman, which makes it even better - comes to mind) which he is too proud to admit, and which he covers up with an aggressive and tantrum-like attitude. I sometimes felt the only things that set Ralph and Trump apart were a few hundred years and a Twitter account. Of course, Follett wrote this novel well before Trump, but that's why good storytelling is so powerful - if done well, it has relevance for generations. One thing I found interesting was the eventual rise and success of Caris. Initially, it seems as though nothing good can come of her life. Then, because of her own hard work, natural intelligence, and good nature, she rises to the top and becomes Prioress of Kingsbridge. However, even then, there are some powers that she is not allowed to wield simply because she is a woman. She holds a seat of power, but is still looked down upon by some (men, mostly) and it is always more challenging for her to hold the clout that is rightfully hers. I think this is interesting because it bears resemblance to life today. Woman often need to work twice as hard to reach a male-dominated position of power, and when they do, are often underappreciated. George R.R. Martin is notorious for killing his characters, but Ken Follett also deserves such notoriety. In this novel, it was common for the first page of a chapter to announce the deaths of \u007f\u007fcharacters who were substantial at some point in the plot. Something also of note, which also occurred in The Pillars of the Earth , is that Follett tends to leave some characters entirely forgotten. Certain men or women that appear early on and play significant roles end up disappearing for either a long period and show up later briefly alive or dead, or they are never spoken about again. I'm not sure why this is...perhaps Follett himself creates stories so long he forgets to bring them back into the story later on for continuity's sake? One thing to gripe about: Ken Follett has a fascination with calling a man's penis his 'prick.' It's so annoying to me for some reason. It's a penis. A dick. A c*ck. Even a member. It should never be a 'prick,' in my mind. I feel that the word 'prick' is used often as a derivative to not sound so repetitive. But it should be omitted no less, it's just a terribly used synonym. Also the romantic scenes are sub par. I would rate this somewhere between 4 and 5 stars (Goodreads, give us more star rating options!). On the whole, an immersive experience and enjoyable read. ...more 4.5 stars.

Lots of info about bubonic plague, medieval treatment methods and bloodletting which I relished. I thoroughly enjoyed the rich tale, spent nearly a month in Kingsbridge and feel a bit homesick for the small cathedral town and its occupants. ...more Total rip off of the first (Pillars of the Earth). Not impressed. Could barely get through it. This novel is Follett's follow up to The Pillars of the Earth which is one of my favorite novels and probably never had a chance of living up to my expectations. It follows the lives of four people beginning with a disturbing childhood encounter. Four very different people: two brothers, one brilliant, but not physically imposing and one one strong and ruthless; and two women, both resourceful, but one from a wealthy family and one for whom life was one struggle after the next.

It follows the lives of four people beginning with a disturbing childhood encounter. Four very different people: two brothers, one brilliant, but not physically imposing and one one strong and ruthless; and two women, both resourceful, but one from a wealthy family and one for whom life was one struggle after the next. Seeing how each played out the hand that medieval life dealt them was the driving force for me. It served to me as a poignant reminder that, especially in the Middle Age, the path of our lives can often be more impacted by sometimes arbitrary laws of Nature, God, and Man than by our own actions. We find that often justice turns a blind eye on our little corner of the world and all we can control is how we respond to the obstacles thrown in our path. Perhaps this same theme is why I was so taken with the first book. And perhaps it's not a difference between the two books that I'm feeling, but a difference in myself over the eighteen years between readings. The idealistic 20 something who read Pillars and felt the unfairness of life in the Middle Ages has been replaced by a 40 something widower who reads of injustice and thinks, \"Eh, sometimes life throws you a parade and sometimes it pisses in your corn flakes. That's just the way that it goes.\" All that being said I found World Without End to be a pleasant journey - and at 1,000+ pages it is a journey, as I was reading it I jokingly referred to the book as \"Novel Without End\". I enjoyed being transported back to a different time and although I didn't care about the characters the way I did reading Pillars of the Earth, I'm glad for the time spent with them. ...more", "Title": "World Without End"},
