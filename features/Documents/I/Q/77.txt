I'm not immune to the charms of chick lit, but I do require it to be witty, have quirky characters, present a plausible and realistic relationship (notice I did not say a \"romance\") that is not the axis upon which the main character's world turns, and a strong female lead. After reading Garden Spells by the same author last year, I knew that Sarah Addison Allen did not meet this criteria. Alas, I had bought The Sugar Queen from the bargain bin before my disappointing experience with Garden Spells and felt compelled to at least give it a whirl. After dutifully trudging through it, I can report that I was every bit as underwhelmed as I expected to be. <---C>Josey Cirrini</---C> has a secret--a deep, dark secret. One that could ruin her life. She's embarrassed and humiliated by what she hides from the world. Want to know what it is? Come closer and I'll tell you. It's--are you sure you can handle this? I'll understand if you're not ready for such a shocking revelation. Okay, well, you're still here, so it's . . . a closet full of candy and romance novels. Hey, don't blame me if you weren't ready for that kind of dark and twisty. You were forewarned! And now Della Lee Baker, the lovable town skank has claimed squatter's rights on Josey Cirrini's closet. You see, Della Lee is on the run from a man that she can't resist and, like one does in such a situation, she immediately runs to the nearest stranger's closet. Della Lee professes her desire to help the shy, awkward Josey find a way to free herself from her overprotective mother and take charge of her life. Secrets are revealed, new loves are forged, old loves are rekindled, and a kind of awkward magical realism is sprinkled throughout. I could go on, but if you're rolling your eyes by now, then I think you get the gist of what Allen is peddling here. Allen's books have been described as \"light\" and \"fluffy\"; I would add \"saccharine\" and \"predictable\" to the list of adjectives. I did not like nor identify with this group of characters and, while there's nothing offensive enough to warrant a one star rating, the novel certainly isn't exceptional in any way. It's a romance, plain and simple, written for women in their 20's and 30's who have forgotten the thrill of a first love and want to vicariously reconnect with that, but preferably not in a way that involves a creepy emo vampire. And, if that's your bag, baby, then groovy--go ahead, pick up a copy, make yourself a nice cuppa tea, grab a blankie and have an estrogen fest. Right now, I'm going to try to restore balance in my reading life by seeing if there's anything on my bookshelf that might involve someone's jugular being ripped out.

I read and loved Sarah Addison Allen 's first novel, Garden Spells , last year on the recommendation of my good friend Michelle . Incidentally, I actually gave my mom Garden Spells for Christmas so there was some fun karmic reciprocity goin' on there. Garden Spells was the perfect autumn read and I finished it itching to get my hands on Allen's second book, which, as it turns out, is the perfect winter read. I love it when my book and the season serendipitously mesh. Set in a small ski resort town in North Carolina with magical snowflakes falling and the smell of peppermint in the air, I had no interest in resisting its spell. I just sat back and let THE SUGAR QUEEN carry me away for a couple of wintry nights. Josey Cirrini loves candy. And I mean Josey LOVES candy. Sweets, snacks, baked goods of any kind. She keeps them in a stash in her closet and retreats there whenever she's feeling particularly anxious or down. Which is pretty much every day, several times a day. You see Josey lives alone with her aging, patrician mother in their aging, empty mansion. And every day her mother reminds her how plain she is, how she should never wear anything but black or white but for-the-love-of-all-that-is-holy no RED, and how she was such a trying child and should spend the rest of her life making it up to her poor, beautiful, widowed mother. Gah. The only bright spot in her day is the moment when their mailman Adam walks up to her door to deliver the mail. Then there's Chloe. Lovely, orphaned, loves to read, lost in love Chloe. She runs a small fast food stand in the local city courthouse lobby, lives with her lawyer boyfriend Jake, and dreams of owning her own home one day after having had to sell the only home she'd ever known when her grandparents passed away. Neither of these girls sees her life changing anytime soon. But on one fateful day a local tramp shows up in Josey's closet and Chloe discovers her boyfriend cheated on her but won't tell her with whom. And, just like that, everything changes. Like its predecessor, THE SUGAR QUEEN is one part magical realism, one part fairy tale, and one part contemporary fiction. And like before, I fell immediately under its spell. I don't know if I was just in the mood for something pretty and sweet and romantic in the dead of winter, or if there's something about Allen's kind, honest characters that speaks to me, but I absolutely loved this book. Possibly even more than Garden Spells , I think, because I liked Josey so much. With her unselfconscious awesomeness, her straightforward goodness, she was vulnerable but never beaten. The slow, pleasantly-deceit-free way she and Adam negotiated their relationship was delightful to me. And Josey and Chloe's friendship, in particular, was extremely well done. I love how helping and being needed by Chloe makes Josey brave. How Chloe recognized Josey for what she was and took her in even when she was the one who was slowly but surely drowning. In a Sarah Addison Allen book, you can always count on a little organic magic and my favorite instance of this in THE SUGAR QUEEN was undoubtedly the way books literally popped up around Chloe whenever she needed them. For example: She could remember very clearly the first time it happened to her. Being an only child raised by her great-grandparents on a farm miles from town, she was bored a lot. When she ran out of books to read, it only got worse. She was walking by the creek along the wood line at the end of the property one day when she was twelve, feeling mopey and frustrated, when she saw a book propped up against a willow tree. She walked over and picked it up. It was so new the spine creaked and popped when she opened it. It was a book on card tricks, full of fun things she could do with the deck of cards her great-grandmother kept in a drawer in the kitchen for her weekly canasta game. She called out, asking if anyone was there. No one answered. She didn't see any harm in looking through the book, so she sat under the tree by the creek and read as much as she could before it got dark. She wanted to take it with her when her great-grandmother called her home, but she knew she couldn't. The owner of the book would surely want it back. So she reluctantly left it by the tree and ran home, trying to commit to memory everything she'd read. After dinner, Chloe took the deck of cards out of the kitchen drawer and went to her bedroom to try some of the tricks. She tried for awhile, but she couldn't get them right without following the pictures in the book. She sighed and gathered the cards she'd spread out on the floor. She stood, and that's when she saw the book, the same book she'd left by the creek, on her nightstand. For awhile after that, she thought her great-grandparents were surprising her with books. She'd find them on her bed, in her closet, in her favorite hideouts around the property. And they were always books she needed. Books on games or novels of adventure when she was bored. Books about growing up as she got older. But when her great-grandparents confronted her about all the books she had and where did she get the money to buy them, she realized they weren't the ones doing it. The next day, under her pillow, she found a book on clever storage solutions. It was exactly what she needed, something to show her how to hide her books. She accepted it from then on. Books liked her. Books wanted to look after her. You can imagine the smile of contentment on my face after I read that passage. It was clear this book and I would get on well. And we did. I absolutely loved it. And you can bet I will be picking up Ms. Allen's upcoming third novel, The Girl Who Chased the Moon , the day it comes out. ...more \u0397 \u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae

You can draw your own conclusions from that :-) Our heroine struggles with self-perception and a lack of self-esteem. Josey is supposed to be a Southern belle...living in a ski resort town in the mountains of North Carolina. She suffers from a domineering mother who for personal reasons really doesn't like her, an unbelievable amount of guilt for tantrums thrown before she became a saint at the ripe old age of nine, a town of busybodies who all remember the tantrums (perhaps I should have reserved \"unbelievable\" for this portion of the plot), and isolation resulting from all of the above. The point of The Sugar Queen is how Josey resolves all of these issues with the help of her polar opposite who shows up unexpectedly in her closet at the beginning of chapter 1. At the same time, various other people affiliated in some way with Josey or her family are going through their own, somehow completely related, problems. The book also contains a smattering of magic, which seems to have been included for no other reason than to help the reader suspend disbelief throughout a string of improbable events. Once you've suspended disbelief, it is possible to enjoy the book in all of it's feel-good splendor :-) At it's heart, that's all this book is, a feel-good novel. A sad woman (and we know she's sad because at least four different people show up to say so and then disappear from the plot) finds happiness and love, a true love is saved, family problems are resolved, and death is established as an okay place. If you have some extra time, like feel-good novels (and I personally do), and desire to learn a little about self-perception and a lot about why to not live your entire life in the same small town, you should give this book a chance :-) ...more Wow!

One day her boring life is turned upside down when she discovers local bad girl, Della Lee, hiding in her closet. Desperate to be rid of Della Lee, Josey makes certain promises that lead her on a journey to self-discovery. An unexpected romance with the mailman, a new friendship and answers to questions about her past follow. I cannot say enough how much I enjoy this author's unique writing style! Each chapter is cleverly named after Josey's favorite sweets and reflects on the various plot themes. Just check out this quote ... \"Books can be possessive, can't they? You're walking around in a bookstore and a certain one will jump out at you, like it had moved there on its own, just to get your attention. Sometimes what's inside will change your life, but sometimes you don't even have to read it. Sometimes it's a comfort just to have a book around. Many of these books haven't even had their spines cracked. 'Why do you buy books you don't even read?' our daughter asks us. That's like asking someone who lives alone why they bought a cat. For company, of course.\" Now who here on Goodreads can't identify with that? Highly recommended! ...more Have you ever finished a whole plate of chocolate cake while binge watching Revenge to fill the emptiness of your nights? If you have, then this book is for you.

If you have, then this book is for you. This is not my usual fare, but I was in the mood for something light, fluffy and sweet, like Meringue. I didn't get the Meringue, but I got The Sugar Queen and it just hit my sweet spot. The Sugar Queen is about three women from a resort town going through a quarter-life crisis (quarter life crisis is real). They unexpectedly find each other and themselves in the process. I liked the characters in this book, they feel authentic, especially, Josey. She's a shy, twenty-seven year old woman who lives as her mother's PA. She dreams of travelling, but her perceived obligations to her mother hold her back, so she gorges on clandestine sweets and pastries for comfort, until she finds Della Lee. Della Lee and Chloe were colorfully written as well, but Josey is the star. Overall, The Sugar Queen is a pleasant read, a good, relaxing option while in between reading more intricate novels. This is my first book from the author, and it certainly won't be the last. ...more I love this story! It's a very strong character-driven tale with all of the ingredients I personally enjoy in a book, a little magic, a little fantasy, romance, conflict, and dream fulfillment.

It's a very strong character-driven tale with all of the ingredients I personally enjoy in a book, a little magic, a little fantasy, romance, conflict, and dream fulfillment. The author chose a very simplistic style of writing and spent very little page space describing the weather, the people's description, and atmosphere which doesn't bother me one bit, since she mastered the storytelling element. She DID describe the main characters enough for you to get a good picture of each one, but she was not redundant about it and I REALLY appreciate that. I'd rather read a book written simply that engages me, than read a beautifully written poem with poor story and character development. The main character, Josey, made herself a warm spot in my heart the same way Della Lee got all cozy inside Josey's closet. But Josey, of course didn't enter my heart in a commanding way. I didn't feel sorry for her because she felt like she was doing something good; and people shouldn't feel bad about doing good things. I just wanted more for her and this desire pulled me into the story. I cared about her and that's important for me as a reader, to care about the main character in some way. The events that unfolded were so natural and made so much sense while still possessing a unique quality. One example of this is the unexpected connection between all of the characters. I am so happy I found this one at the library in hard cover. I think Sarah Addison Allen might be my new favorite author. I'll be picking up Garden Spells next. This excites me greatly as I have a high affinity for sweets (which drew me to The Sugar Queen) and I'm obsessed with gardening, which is drawing me to Garden Spells. I hope it's just as enchanting as TSQ. ...more This treacly romance was lauded by reviewers, but I found it as difficult to swallow as a spoonful of raw sugar.

Nothing unusual there, except the author adds elements of magical realism that are not quite successful. For example, there is a strange woman living in the closet of one of the women who may or may not be real. When her presence is hurriedly explained at book's end, it feels abrupt and odd. The author's clumsy foreshadowing doesn't adequately prepare the reader for the supernatural revelation that doesn't really match the rest of the novel's traditional tone. The dialogue is nothing special, the arch of the parallel romances predictable. If romance is your genre, take a look, but this book doesn't rise above type enough to make it universally appealing. ...more I will get a red cardigan - and think of Josey's. I enjoyed this even more than Garden Spells! I liked the chapter titles! And the way books inexplicably appear when Chloe needs them (or when the book thinks Chloe needs it). The relationship between Josey, Della Lee & Chloe develops. And the big laugh I got from the Cirrini's new maid near the end! I recommend it! I am so excited I must get her latest book!!! I think this author is best read when you\u2019re lying low, feeling tired, sick or just plain soul-weary.

This is the second novel of hers I\u2019ve read and just like Garden Spells it was a classically perfect definition of an escape. And even though it is Sunday night, a notoriously depressing night of the week for me on account of tomorrow being Monday when I find I must return to a soul-stealing corporate job, I\u2019m relaxed and riding high on the fuzzy afterglow of having just had my saccharine sweet girl tank filled to the brim by this enchanting book. I usually have to be in a special place in my life to receive sweet stories well and even then, my pessimistic side usually takes over and thwarts any enjoyment that might have been there. But for whatever reason, Sarah Addison Allen is batting 2 for 2 with me at this point. And I suspect the elements of magical realism have something to do with this. It keeps the pessimist at bay by starkly reminding her that this is just a story and there\u2019s nothing wrong with calmly sitting back and enjoying a gentle tale. This book also spoke to me on a personal level, one that I can\u2019t and won\u2019t delve into too deeply on account of spoilers. But witnessing the budding relationship and friendship between Josey, the main character, and Della Lee and between Josey and Chloe, two local women whispered at something that I\u2019ve always felt was missing from my life. And reading a happy story where a bond can form between women who would otherwise be at odds with each other was like balm for my soul. Unrealistic as all get out but hey, sometimes that is how the cookie crumbles and sometimes, just what this cookie needs. ...more Books come to Chloe when she needs them to tell her things; Della shows up in Josey's closet (which holds the stash of sweets, romances, and travel inforama that Josey hides from her domineering mother) to tell Josey to get a life, and Josey?

Part of the reason I liked this so well is because it was exactly what I needed right now...essentially, I inadvertently pulled a Chloe in that this book showed up on my holds list and I checked it out and listened to it and it helped soothe my troubled soul. Well, if I had a soul. It helped calm the oozing, black miasma that takes the place of my soul, is probably a more-accurate statement. This is a story about oppressed women, people who are kept in little boxes (closets?) by their mothers, their fathers, their grandmothers, their significant others, their perceived roles in society, and by themselves. These boxes are dismantled to varying degrees in a number of ways throughout the book, though only for the main women of the story that we know of. (Olivia's granddaughter is probably still under the old woman's thumb) So! It's probably fairly obvious to readers of this genre or of horrorish/supernatural tales that Della Lee, the closet-dweller, isn't what she seems. That's all fine and fun but what I liked was the friendship Della orchestrated between Josie and Chloe which was followed by a reluctant bond between Josie and Della. Female friendship is such a strange thing; I find that many women can't do it. They have this idea that women are essentially evil and untrustworthy. I get that; I thought the same thing all through college because my female peers were often catty, untrustworty, horrible people. You get burned enough times by girls and you avoid them. But that's not actually how female friendship really works. If you can find it, it is so worth having and keeping forever and I like that this is a theme throughout the book. The InstaFriend thing is explained which didn't do anything for me one way or another but does magically make sense of the super blossoming adoration between Josie and Chloe. And speaking of Chloe - I love LOVED her books. LOVED THEM! The whole idea of books appearing as needed is charming! I guess I have the next best thing in that I work with books all day, four days a week, but still. This is like magical readers advisory and I completely loved that. The romance is probably really nice and wonderful. I hate romance so that was just background noise for me but I'm sure people who like romance will think the two main and one side love stories are adorable and sweet, etc. I couldn't connect with Chloe and Jake; I don't buy the whole \"accidental moment of indiscretion\" thing and I've always believed that if he cheats once, he'll do it again but...her situation, not mine. I was torn on my feelings about Helena. How much of her is a big stereotype? Is it a racist stereotype? I don't know; I'm not the one to answer that. Still, something about her rudimentary English and her superstitious ways and her little Oldsie/Oldgret joke rubbed me the wrong way, though I don't know why. It's not like I haven't met people who speak broken English and who are highly superstitous. This representation just bothered me for some reason, maybe because she was a pivotal background character and I wanted more from her? I don't know. It was the overall feeling of the story, the building of friendships which lead to the breaking down of walls which lead to new experiences and richer lives, that had me all in love with the story. It makes me feel good to know that, at least in FictionLand, tiny touches of everyday magic can help move a body along to a healed place. That was a message I needed to hear right now. ...more First, can someone please tell me where to find the radioactive spider that will give me the superpower of having books randomly appear when I need them?

I would love to be bitten IMMEDIATELY. Now, if any of you follow what I have been reading lately, you might question my choices and opinions of books, especially considering that I jumped from reading a whimsical, southern love story to gobbling down the memoir of a teenage meth addict. My reading psychosis is bipolarity: I need the light and dreamy qualities of Sarah Addison Allen just as much as I crave the intellectual, the depressing, the humorous, and the ridiulous. Her books appear right when I need them, this one in particular revealing itself in the clearance section of a half-priced bookstore, and I have concluded that her novels are always a welcome breath of fresh air. It may seem unfair that I am much more critical of other books than I am of Sarah Addison Allen's novels. I have been known to pick apart books mercilessly, to fixate on minor hiccups and tear literature apart for them. In all honesty, I could probably do that with most of Allen's works if I so chose. However, this author in particular allows me to suspend my critical thoughts and escape from reality so completely that I cannot give her books anything but praise. When I pick up an SAA book, I immediately fall in love, swept away in her worlds where magic is a fact of life and love is always coming. Her breezy, southern charm envelops me like a warm, soft blanket, and I revel in the sweetness of her work. \"The Sugar Queen\" was especially wonderful to read, not only because of how sincerely I identified with Josey but also because of the way Allen threaded her characters together. Josey, Chloe and Della Lee were a pleasure to get to know and to walk with, even for a short time. If you are looking for a light, fun, whimsical novel that will counteract the stress of your life, I highly recommend reading \"The Sugar Queen.\" If anything, it will make you grab a cup of sweet tea and relax for a few hours. ...more You know how when you are not feeling well you are told to each chicken soup?

This mysterious woman in her closet, this Della Lee, turns Josey\u2019s \u201csimple\u201d life upside-down, by making her step out of her comfort zone and discover who she really is, whether she wants to or not.

The author injected a wit and magical realism that set it apart from a typical romance, and the ending though somewhat unrealistic, even in romance terms, was still satisfying.

She has a frozen heart that prevents her from showing affection to anyone, including her daughter. She embodies a lost love. Chloe Finley, our third corner, is a lovely, young lady in the perfect relationship; until her lover, Jake, admits he cheated on her in a moment of drunken, reckless abandon. Her world is shattered. She is left trying to pick up the remnants of a broken love. Finally, in the last edge of our puzzle, there is Della Lee. She is a thirty eight year old woman, who has had a hard life. She is someone who has never been lucky in love. She has struck out and given up on love. She mysteriously appears in Josey's closet to find redemption and perhaps grasp at a glimmer of hope that love may still exist. Her arrival is \"the moment that changes everything.\" Our story begins and our puzzle pieces start to snap in place. As you read the book you find that every scrap of information, each story and interaction, no matter how trivial they seem are all a part of the big picture. The magic of this story lies in uncovering each piece and discovering how and where it fits into the puzzle. At the end you have finished a masterpiece, that interlocks all the characters. Completed with amazing writing; delicious, delectable descriptions and a tiny taste of magic. It is a beautifully crafted work that will linger with you like a piece of spun sugar that slowly coats and melts over your tongue. What I Liked: *I loved the characters. This book has alternating points of view; this allows you to see inside the character and to learn them inside and out. Observing through the eyes of each person provides an understanding for their motives and behavior. Ms. Addison creates such intriguing characters; I was fascinated and invested in each person. The secondary characters, Jake, Adam, Helena and many others are just as complex and interesting. It is wondrous to watch them transform. *The writing is fantastic. This book is filled with detailed, sensory descriptions that make your mouth water. I love Ms. Addison's writing. She has vaulted into my top tier of writers. *This story is so intricate. It takes it's own sweet time to develop. It is like a lazy summer day. It builds and connects the players in unexpected ways. Several times I was surprised by the connections; the final twist had my mouth agape. I did not see it coming! The outcome is bitter sweet. Not everything resolves into a happy ending but that is the way of life and love. And The Not So Much: *I would have liked more background information for Chloe and Della Lee. For Chloe I wanted a little more familial input. Della Lee's story was not clear. I wish there was more insight into what led to her final choice that ultimately placed her in Josey's closet. What happened to her? Why was she feeling so desperate? *I was sad that there was not a resolution for Margaret. At first I did not like her and I hated the way she treated Josey. Once I understood why she was so icy, I felt for her. I hoped that I would see her thaw out but instead her story is left unfinished. *This is trivial, but when one of the characters said, \"In case I forget to tell you later, I had a good time tonight\", I cringed. This used up line was out of place in this magical book. I absolutely loved this book. This novel has real characters that you fall in love with. I am going to miss hearing their voices now that their story is complete. It is a tremendous book that smoothly fits everyone together. It has a bit of mystery and a hint of magic. Pick this book up and fall in love. Don't read it with an empty tummy, the delicious descriptions will leave you salivating for sweets and for more of Sarah Addison Allen's enticing stories. Favorite Quotations: \"His words surrounded her like perfume.\" \"This is what happens when bad furniture happens to good people.\" \"I think heaven will be like a first kiss.\" \"His voice the melody to all her favorite songs.\" \"The moon spun a spider web of light around her hair.\" ...more I requested this book at the library when a friend informed me it had been released.

In _Garden Spells_, it was the apple tree. In _The Sugar Queen_ it's.....books. Allen writes these non-human characters so very well, they almost become more dear than the main protagonists. I enjoy books that surprise me, and books with twists. For this reason, I make an effort sometimes to NOT try to figure out the secrets characters keep. Some authors make this difficult to do because the secret revelations are so obvious. Allen's books manage to surprise me.

I wonder why my digital copy of this has no mention of any. I know the reason. The story is real. How can an author write so real about a person living half way of the world? and here it goes... When Josey woke up and saw the feather frost on her windowpane, she smiled. Finally, it was cold enough to wear long coats and tights. It was cold enough for scarves and shirts worn in layers, like camouflage. It was cold enough for her lucky red cardigan, which she wore had a power of its own. She loved this time of year. Summer was tedious with the light dresses she pretended to be comfortable in while secretly sure she looked like a loaf of white bread wearing a belt. The cold was such a relief. And I moved on\u2026 Josey Cirrini is a 27-year old living a life her mother, Margaret, wanted her to be. Fat, Unsocial and living under her mother\u2019s thumb as what everyone sees her. Josey has been living this life until one day Della Lee had appeared in her closet giving her all the truths about her life as Josey find her way on her journey to finding her true love, friendship and family relationship as by and by she soon learned to accept how fate manipulated her life. Though at first the story is centered with Josey, it is noteworthy to mention Margaret Cirrini\u2019s pain in understanding her reasons why she considered Josey a punishment. This book also includes magically fascinating characters of Chloe Finley, Della Lee, Jake Yardley and Family, Adam Boswell, Nova Berry, and Julian. For others probably this book belongs to an average magical realism fiction. But for me, it gave me all the stings reading a bowdlerized version of my life, THANK YOU for I am changing my habits forever but I am embracing the happy-ending part and the fairy in my closet. This review has been very personal and I prefer to continue this at Fairy in my Closet ...more The Sugar Queen is a standalone novel written by author Sarah Addison Allen .

I thought it was funny how a lot of the main character, Josey's experiences were described like some kind of sugary sweet. \u201cLike magic, she felt him getting nearer, felt it like a pull in the pit of her stomach. It felt like hunger but deeper, heavier. Like the best kind of expectation. Ice cream expectation. Chocolate expectation.\u201d I have to admit the character development was excellent. If you're a fan of chick lit with a magical element then you should check it out! My favorite quote: \u201cBooks can be possessive, can't they? You're walking around in a bookstore and a certain one will jump out at you, like it had moved there on its own, just to get your attention. Sometimes what's inside will change your life, but sometimes you don't even have to read it. Sometimes it's a comfort just to have a book around. Many of these books haven't even had their spines cracked. 'Why do you buy books you don't even read?' our daughter asks us. That's like asking someone who lives alone why they bought a cat. For company, of course.\u201d ...more Yet another book I can add that has or involves books with food thrown in the mix, in its story and one I always wanted to read.

But I loved that she slowly moves forward, with help along the way. Oh and Adam. You get hug points for being adorable. Anyway, I was drawn to the story and love the cover. I also liked the chapter titles. Warning though, don't read this on an empty stomach. Right from the first chapter, I was hooked in and didn't want to stop reading. Then realized I was halfway into the book and took a little break, not wanting to finish the boo right away. Whenever I feel that way, I'm not as into the book as I was. But with Sugar Queen it was the opposite. You feel sorry for the other characters but as the story progresses, you find there's more to it. Near the end I'll admit I didn't expect but at the same time, thought back to it and was like oh, good job book. Basically what I'm saying is the book is pretty good. And looking forward to reading the author's other books. ...more OH. This is really well done, compelling writing. There's great incorporation of magical realism and a fabulous setting. There are flaws, too, but the writing drew me along anyway. Flaws include Chloe being nervous to tell Jake about the books when he knew about the eggs frying and coffee boiling and obviously dealt with those just fine. There's also the fact that (view spoiler) [Jake cheats, but he's really just a good guy who made a mistake (hide spoiler) ] and I hate those storylines. And there OH.

And there are plot threads, things Josey finds out but never acts on, that are completely abandoned. She tells Adam about Della Lee, but what about Chloe? So: flaws and an insufficient resolution - but I still liked this. ...more I feel sorry for myself that I wasted three hours of my life reading this book. It was neither fun chick lit, nor was it quality magical realism, nor can I even put it in the same genre as a trashy romance novel. The metaphors were awful, the writing was terrible, and the plot was pointless. That being said, I did finish it, but I think that's more a testament to my desire to always find out what happens than to any talent on the part of the writer. I loved this book! It was a cute, quick read with some memorable characters. Originally posted here . Last year, I enjoyed reading Garden Spells by Sarah Addison Allen.

The Sugar Queen is, in many ways, similar to Garden Spells \u2013 the magical realism, the love story/romance angle, the familiar characters to whom it\u2019s so easy to relate. But The Sugar Queen is a delightful and charming story on its own. * The only comfort in twenty-seven-year-old Josey Cirrini\u2019s monotonous life are the stash of sweets and pile of paperback romances that she keeps hidden in her room closet. Her life is uneventful, having settled in her mother\u2019s house to take care of her and contenting herself in small glimpses of her longtime crush Adam, who delivers the mail every day, until one day she finds that motor mouth, bizarre Della Lee Baker, a local waitress, has taken up residence in her closet. Through Della Lee, she meets Chloe Finley, who is mysteriously and literally hounded by books wherever she goes, and Julian, who is nothing but bad news. From the moment Josey finds Della Lee parked in her closet, her life is whirled into a spiral of events and she discovers that there is so much going on in the world that she\u2019s completely missing out on \u2013 including the chance to love. * Despite her passive nature \u2013 her quiet acquiescence to her mother\u2019s every command and seeming helplessness with respect to, well, nearly everything \u2013 I really liked Josey. Ordinarily, I am wont to be annoyed at characters like her because I hate pushovers, and Josey was a big, over-age one. She ought to know better, and she had a good head on her shoulders, which she proves later on in the story. But for the first part, she practically allowed herself hostage to the whims and caprices of everyone around her. Still, there was something about Josey that kept me from hating her \u2013 she was charming and honest and, for her age, very na\u00efve. Perhaps these were the very same things that drew the other characters to her: Adam the mailman/love interest, most of all. I liked how the stories of the other characters were developed around Josey. Della Lee had her own story, Chloe had her own, even Josey\u2019s mother had her own story, all of which were deftly interwoven into Josey\u2019s. Speaking of Chloe, it was fun reading how books \u2013 mostly self-help or advice \u2013 would literally turn up whenever and wherever she was \u2013 in the bathroom, in her shop, inside her car, absolutely anywhere \u2013 depending on her current state of mind. I already knew from reading Garden Spells that Sarah Addison Allen\u2019s books have their \u201cidentity\u201d in magical realism, and this is one of the aspects that I enjoyed more. Over all, I really liked The Sugar Queen . There was a part in the end that completely took me by surprise (hindsight, though, it could have easily been predictable) and satisfactorily answered my initial confusion about a few details. I liked how the novel ended too, which was fair enough \u2013 everyone happy and good and in their proper places in their lives. The book can\u2019t be all good and fluff if it didn\u2019t make me feel that way now, can it? More Sarah Addison Allen in the future!

I remember picking it up and immediately relating to the protagonist, Josey Cirrini. Josey, a 28 year old woman lives alone with her cold, wealthy mother.

Over the years she becomes Dickensian, very reclusive, pining over gorgeous mailmen, gorging herself on her secret candy treasure to make herself feel better. The story gets interesting So I read this book when it came out in 2009. I remember picking it up and immediately relating to the protagonist, Josey Cirrini. Josey, a 28 year old woman lives alone with her cold, wealthy mother. She is guilty of her horrendous behavior as a child, so as repentance she stays to care for her overbearing mama. Over the years she becomes Dickensian, very reclusive, pining over gorgeous mailmen, gorging herself on her secret candy treasure to make herself feel better. The story gets interesting when trashy spitfire Della Lee comes into her life. Della Lee claims she needs a place to stay so she can get away from her abusive boyfriend. She blackmails our heroine into letting her stay in the closet with a promise that she will not tell her ice queen mother about her sugary hoarde. With Josey's new closet pal to talk to, things start changing for her, bringing some much needed excitement into Josey's dull existence. Shadowing this fascinating tale is her late father's past. Cute, light premise, but the story gets more serious, twisting the sweet with the sour. This is a great story to welcome winter because it is set in the snowy season of a North Carolina ski-resort town. I enjoyed seeing every chapter in the book named after a type of candy, and that the candy name is actually tied into the chapter topic. Tip: If you really like simple magic in fiction, you'll love the character Chloe with a very bookish secret. She definitely made the novel for me. This book has it all: sugary sweet confections, true love, bittersweet understanding, and dark family secrets, all wrapped up in Southern charm. ...more This one wasn't as magical and playful as Garden Spells , but I still enjoyed it.

This book has really pulled me in and made reading fun. I adore how each chapter title is a name of a candy. I feel that I have much in common with Josey.
