If you live in Scandinavia you might consider this par for the course, ennui is imbued into the populace (as it is also reflected in the works of prominent Russian writers - Anna Karenina comes to mind). Just as we continue to struggle here in the States with our history of slavery and the resulting racial tensions, so do Europe and Scandinavia struggle in coming to terms with Nazism and the Bolshevik revolution (More than a few reviewers have expressed their dissatisfaction with the Nordic writers' pre-occupation with Nazism). And yet, the rise in popularity of these Nordic thrillers here in the States is puzzling given our strong tendency towards literary Romanticism. We like for the good guys to win, we like emotion, we like our heroes (as opposed to anti-heroes) we enjoy free will, and in general consider ourselves in control of our own lives. Having said that: there is excellence in Literary Naturalism. The above doesn't mean we can't enjoy a well written novel, an intriguing mystery, a flawed anti-hero, a well crafted story written in the style of literary Naturalism. It doesn't mean we can't enjoy the works of Jo Nesbo . I did. In Jo Nesbo's words: \"I come from a family of readers and story tellers.\" With a librarian mother and a father who sat before the fire and told the kids stories they wanted to hear (each repetition bringing something new to the tale) Jo's foundation was carved in stone. Again, in his own life story we sense the determinism filtering into his life: he wanted to be a soccer star but an injury put a quick stop to this; with a dreadful feeling of fate guiding his life he entered the military in the hopes something would happen (what happened was \"Self-Discipline\"); thinking he might want to be an economist he entered the world of finance which he abandoned as well; someone told him he could play guitar (he only knew 3 chords) and he formed several bands, Di Derre being the most successful; and finally he wrote (on an airplane to begin with) and he never stopped. The Redbreast is Jo Nesbo's third <---C>Harry Hole</---C> (pronounced \"Hooleh\") novel (the other two not being translated for a US audience as of yet) and is Nesbo's claim to fame.<---F> So, this is where we start</---F>. Yes, the books should be read in order! For an American audience, Harry Hole can be likened to Harry Bosch ; he defies authority, is an outcast within his own organization, is best left alone to do this job (his office is at the end of the hall), is more of an anti-hero than a hero, has trouble with his romantic life, lives alone, has a fierce propensity for justice (as opposed to the Law) and once let loose is like a pit bull with a bone fastened to his jaws. But perhaps the most compelling reason why Harry Hole has such a following is Nesbo's devastating characterization of what exactly comprises a flawed hero. Upon reflection, American hard-boiled writers don't come close to accomplishing the same. This is not too dissimilar to the way Nesbo sees himself. Bjarne M\u00f8ller, my former boss, says people like me always choose the line of most resistance. It's in what he calls our 'accursed nature'. That's why we always end up on our own. I don't know. I like being alone. Perhaps I have grown to like my self-image of being a loner, too....I think you have to find something about yourself that you like in order to survive. Some people say being alone is unsociable and selfish. But you're independent and you don't drag others down with you, if that's the way you're heading. Many people are afraid of being alone. But it made me feel strong, free and invulnerable. And...ah, yes, there is the matter of plot! So how do we justify this decided streak of fate/determinism within the novels with Nesbo's apparent mastery of plot? The two seemingly ought to contradict each other. On the one hand, we have Nesbo's almost Shakespearean tendency to cast characters as marionette puppets on the strings of fate (the very opposite of plot), while on the other hand we are riveted by the very complex actions and reactions made by Harry Hole during his investigations (Nesbo is a master at not adding anything superfluous to his novels). Perhaps it is an unholy marriage between the two that transfixes us. His plots are intricate, very complex, the seemingly irrelevant details exposed throughout the novels become larger than life as the story closes, and they can weave through time, forward and backward, as the story unfolds. But, with a little alacrity, we can remember we are reading Naturalism and so it isn't always Harry Hole making events happen, but rather the reverse, it is the events that move Harry Hole. Again, it is a matter of preference but in Nesbo's case it is done with utter expertise as a writer. The exposition/setting is often Scandinavia: the weather is somber, the descriptions grey-like, the people absorbed with alcohol and withdrawn, if not bundled and sequestered. And yet, the dialogue and scenes are full of references to other millieus', continents, languages, and cleverly hidden philosophical references that speak to a widely cultured audience (as opposed to American writers of this genre who rarely venture beyond the borders of their land, if not their own State). And as with plot, there are no superfluous details. Everything in the novels matters and Nesbo does not forget even the tiniest detail to which he's made a seemingly furtive reference earlier on in the story. This is one of the biggest reasons why I love Jo Nesbo. I thoroughly enjoyed Jo Nesbo's The Redbreast and am currently reading the remaining Harry Hole novels. I remain intrigued by events left undone (such as the fate of our undiscovered villain in this and other stories). You'll just have to read the novels to find out more. Oh, yes, as with other series this review is likely to be repeated for all (unless there is a drastic divergence from what I have written here). So, if you've read this review, you've read 'em all.

His reputation appears to be well-deserved. Admittedly, I did have to work a little to get into the book at first. <+++>The Snowman</+++> is the seventh Harry Hole novel, so I felt a bit like I was overhearing the middle of a conversation. I also had somewhat of a learning curve to overcome when it came to the landscape, characters, and the political structure of the Norwegian law enforcement. Additionally, I found the frequent references to early 1990/2000s American politics a bit odd. However, once I had a chance to settle into the world of Harry Hole, I was hooked. Hole is my kind of antihero- he's rough, full of action with little regard for politics or personal consequences, and determined to suss out the truth no matter what the outcome; yet he is still a man with a tender core, he has his own strong code of ethics and an intense respect for justice. The red herrings, frequent twists and shocking revelations really kept the story moving along, and the ending was ridiculously vivid and suspenseful. I hope that Harper Collins plays on the success of this novel and goes back to release the Harry Hole novels in order. I'd be first on line for my copies. ...more if this had been the first book i'd read of the series, it would also be the last. 'the other end!' she exclaimed, removing her hands from her face.

Hole, for those who haven't made his acquaintance, is a maverick who prefers to work alone and to play by his own rules. He struggles with alcohol; his personal life is a mess, and, as a practical matter, he lives for his job. Early in his career, Harry gained some fame, or notoriety as the case may be, for catching a serial killer while he was detailed to a case in Australia. He's the only policeman in Norway ever to have dealt with a serial killer since, as far as anyone knows, there's never been a serial killer in the country. Now, though, that may have changed. One night, after the first snowfall of the season, a young boy discovers that his mother is missing. To add to the mystery, someone has built a snowman in the family's yard and the snowman is wearing a scarf belonging to the boy's mother. Harry is assigned to the case, along with his new partner, Katrine Bratt, who has just transferred into the Oslo P.D. from another city. As he digs deeper into the woman's disappearance, Harry discovers that over the years, a total of eleven women have gone missing under similar circumstances. Harry believes that a serial killer is at work, though his bosses remain skeptical, especially since the bodies of the missing women have never been found. The Brass would prefer to believe that the women simply abandoned their families and ran off. They're forced to reconsider, though, when Harry receives a letter, apparently from the killer, whom the police now dub the Snowman. The Snowman apparently believes that he's the most successful serial killer of all, certainly in Norway, and he seems to want to match wits with Norway's most famous serial killer hunter--Harry Hole. Accordingly, his bosses name Harry to head a small task force to look into the case. The game is on and it's a very complex and intriguing match between two unorthodox and brilliant protagonists. Nesbo keeps the tension running high throughout the book, which takes a number of unexpected twists and turns. All in all, it's a very entertaining book and Harry Hole continues to be one of the most intriguing protagonists to appear in crime fiction of late. I'm really looking forward to the next book in the series. ...more This is my first <---A>Jo Nesb\u00f8</---A> novel, but it won\u2019t be my last.

That\u2019s where we met that person before!\u201d In fact, I almost gave up in frustration. It took 75-100 pages to get oriented, long for a genre book.

I looked up some Goodreads reviews, and some people advised me to stick with it. I\u2019m glad I did. Soon the plot, about the search for a serial killer who leaves snowmen outside his victims\u2019 homes, began to go in a fascinating direction, the number of suspects (and victims) began adding up, and I was playing whodunit along with Harry and his intense new colleague, Katrina Bratt. Among the characters in the book are a sleazy media type, a plastic surgeon with some secrets, and a disgraced cop looking to make a comeback. The book\u2019s themes include colonialism in Africa, prostitution, rare diseases and paternity tests. There\u2019s a whiff of misogyny to the book that is disturbing, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s part of the culture or part of this specific book. One scene set at a taping of one of Norway\u2019s much-watched TV talk shows was so exciting it got me shouting \u201cYes\u201d once I figured out what was going on. And the murder sequences can be quite gruesome. There\u2019s one particular prop I\u2019m eager to see on screen (although I might be shielding my eyes while watching); I just can\u2019t picture how it works. I didn\u2019t find much depth to Hole, but I chalk that up to the fact that I\u2019ve missed the previous six books. After reading the next two in the series, I may backtrack to fill in the gaps. But in the meantime, I\u2019m glad spring is here and there\u2019s no more snow on the ground.

(hide spoiler) ] All the twists and turns had me gasping and constantly giving Harry Hole my words of advice. On audio, the incomprehensible-to-my-ears names had me reeeeally confused at times. Without having the names on paper, I started remembering the opening lines of Def Leppard's Rock of Ages: \"Gunter glieben glausen globen\"-- only here it was: \"Gunter Edah Odas Oden.\" And so my mind wandered...to rock music.... Toward the end I thought the author went too long on some explanations, although the last hour was very exciting. Harry Hole is such an unfortunate name to be saddled with. He is really a very likeable character that I wouldn't mind reading about again. ...more This might have been worth three stars, because I quite enjoyed it, but I\u2019ve been stingy and given it just two, because of the disproportionate number of five star ratings it has, which I don\u2019t think it deserves.

Never read one of Nesbo's books so didn't know what to expect, but so many people recommended this to me because I like mysteries and non- American police procedurals .

Otherwise it's a great read! ...more This extremely popular Nordic crime fiction series features Inspector Harry Hole. The setting is cold November in Oslo. Harry tangles with a serial killer whose penchant is making a snowman to leave at the scene of each grisly murder. For the most part, I found the narrative to be suspenseful, and the protagonist is somebody I can root for although Harry has his inner demons to battle. Author Jo Nesb\u00f8 has won another fan to his crime fiction series. \u0395\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5

Every time I see a snowman now I will be a bit creeped out ;-). Once in a while I got a bit confused while reading this but I still rate it 4 stars. Harry Hole is one of those detectives I'd like to meet sometime. Looking forward to the movie. I had a little trouble getting into this book but once I did it was gripping and very creepy in places. However, I found it overly long and felt that the complex plot could have been simplified a tad to keep the tension high between killings. As usual for Jo Nesbo the writing was strong and the plot had sufficient false leads and red herrings to make it difficult to identify the killer (although there are early clues pointing in the right direction if you're watching carefully). In the Snowman, H I had a little trouble getting into this book but once I did it was gripping and very creepy in places. However, I found it overly long and felt that the complex plot could have been simplified a tad to keep the tension high between killings. As usual for Jo Nesbo the writing was strong and the plot had sufficient false leads and red herrings to make it difficult to identify the killer (although there are early clues pointing in the right direction if you're watching carefully). In the Snowman, Harry Hole finally has a serial killer to track down in Norway, the first ever apparently. As usual, he is portrayed as a loner, struggling to stay away from alcohol and still in two minds about his ex-wife Rakel. Not liked by any of the hierarchy in the police force because of his independent streak, they would be happy to see him make a serious error and be dismissed, however Harry continues to disappoint them by being the one to make the breakthroughs. There were some very dark and creepy scenes in this book and a very high drama, action packed ending. Nesbo's descriptions of the cold and snowy landscape are very evocative and add to the chilliness of the crimes. I'm sure that every time I see a snowman in future I will think of this novel. ...more 'The Snowman', creeped me out! Lovely! It was sooooooo good! I was up all Saturday night because I couldn't stand not knowing how the book would end. There were three possible suspects, and I truly thought it could be any one of them up to the last chapters. I was completely unable to suss out the mysteries. I held my breath so often I damn near burst a blood vessel. Maybe I did. There are horrors in life which I hope never cross my path and there are horrors that are deliciously fun - afterwords 'The Snowman', creeped me out! Lovely! It was sooooooo good! I was up all Saturday night because I couldn't stand not knowing how the book would end. There were three possible suspects, and I truly thought it could be any one of them up to the last chapters. I was completely unable to suss out the mysteries. I held my breath so often I damn near burst a blood vessel. Maybe I did. There are horrors in life which I hope never cross my path and there are horrors that are deliciously fun - afterwords. Then, there are reads which perform both of the intricate dances of horror together, like this book. This is the 7th book in the Norwegian detective Harry Hole mystery series. If your eyes went wide at reading 'Norwegian' and you thought, \"uh oh - hardboiled and graphic\", gentle reader, well, ok then, yes. But it is not graphic in a sadistically lingering manner the way some 100% Horror genre novels do. However, 'The Snowman' definitely follows the established protocols for the insane serial killer genre. If you are smiling right now, gentle reader, then I highly recommend this book, and this literary mystery series, to you. (Personally, snowmen are now part of my irrational fears collection of awful things, right behind clowns.) I think this particular novel in the series can be read as a standalone, but many of the reasons for Harry Hole's complicated life (his bosses want to fire him for alcoholism and insubordination, his work partners tend to be murdered, his girlfriends love/hate him, he has sort of adopted an ex-girlfriend's son emotionally, he is considered the police team's resident serial-killer expert) has more depth and intensity if the series is read in order, beginning with 'The Bat' https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... , a book, by the way, whose plot is referred to in 'The Snowman' again and again. I have a small bit of advice: 'The Bat' was written before the author firmed up his 'voice' for Harry Hole, so it might mislead a reader new to the series into thinking the detective has occasional summers of redemption instead of the continual dark cold misery Hole lives with. Hole has no illusions, whatsoever, about how evil people can be because of his cases - book after book.... The plot whips back and forth between the past and present at first, which I think was done a touch clumsily, so I thought I couldn't give this novel the five stars it might deserve. The initial clumsiness of handling the time changes annoyed me so much. However, it ends up being such a high-octane intricate plot, all is forgiven. I apologize if you were expecting a story synopsis - I think this plot is WAY too much fun in discovering what happens as a cold read! ...more Somewhat higher ratio of detective work to fluff in this book.

Who enjoys this crap? In my rarely humble opinion, there are only two reasons an author includes such graphic brutality: 1) they want to sell more books to sicko readers and/or 2) they are a sicko themselves. Ugh.

When I got this book I was so excited as I had already heard a bit of buzz generating around it and I do love a good whodunnit especially when combined with a rugged, loner Detective! I think Scandanavian crime novels are enjoying quite a bit of limelight at the moment and I did love Stieg Larssons books so I was very curious about this one too. Well, I picked it up last week to have a scan through and before I knew it I had read the first three chapters without pausing for breath. It was fantastic! The book starts in 1980 with a young child being made to wait in the car for his Mother as she says she needs to pop into someones house for 10 minutes. When the Mother returns to the car 40 minutes later (scared, as she is sure that she saw someones face at the window) she finds her child in a state of fear and confusion saying that he \u201chad seen him\u201d. When his mother asks who, he can only reply \u201cThe Snowman\u201d. Fast forward twenty-four years, Oslo Detective Harry Hole (said rugged Detective) is investigating the disappearance of several women who all share the fact of being married with at least one child. He is assigned a new partner, the very pretty but aloof Katrine Bratt, and the two of them set about trying to find the connection between the women who have disappeared and the only thing that seems to connect them all is that there is a snowman at the scene of every disappearance and the women have all vanished every year on the first day of snowfall. Not only that, but Harry feels he is being watched. He received a mysterious note claiming to be from The Snowman and inviting him to find out who he is. Harry and Katrine then find out that a Detective in Bergen, who also appears to have been investigating the case, disappeared 14 years ago and has never been seen since. As Harry Hole starts to fit all the pieces together, it is clear that there is more to the case than meets the eye. With a smattering of red herrings and mistaken identities you start to suspect everyone who graces the pages of this book. There is, of course, the obligatory nail-biting climax to the book when everything comes together all at once, and the old race-against-the-clock, will he / won\u2019t he make it in time. I love that though; the edge-of-your-seet stuff. The whole book, for me, pacey and gritty and just not wanting to put the damn thing down. If you enjoy crime / thrillers / whodunnits then you will LOVE this! I am over the moon that I have found a new author who has four other books that I am excited now to seek out (all in the Harry Hole series, yay!). ...more The Snowman is a blizzard of cliches, a swirling maelstrom of silly nightmares and a great mound of nonsense. It's a serial-killer murder-mystery where the narration shifts so much and the details are handed out so inconsistently you feel like the author is leading you around by the nose. The red-herrings are numerous and obvious (multiple times, the police become convinced they've caught the killer; the back-slapping is so strenuous I'm surprised there aren't more injuries) and the depictions o The Snowman is a blizzard of cliches, a swirling maelstrom of silly nightmares and a great mound of nonsense. It's a serial-killer murder-mystery where the narration shifts so much and the details are handed out so inconsistently you feel like the author is leading you around by the nose. The red-herrings are numerous and obvious (multiple times, the police become convinced they've caught the killer; the back-slapping is so strenuous I'm surprised there aren't more injuries) and the depictions of murder so over-the-top I found myself laughing out loud (imagine every possible combination of snowman imagery + corpse you can think of.) But worst of all was how often my BS detector went off when any character (ANY character) opened their mouth to mention something about how they feel the world works. On this final point I feel compelled to provide examples. At one point, a supposedly intelligent (though arrogant) pundit claims George W. Bush's re-election as president was a good thing for international security because his advisers are brilliant; ignoring the fact that those clever minds thought the invasion of Iraq was a good idea, that surely Sadam Hussein was hiding WMDs (even though his hiding his own weakness was just as plausible) and that they came into office thinking the great security issue they'd face would be ballistic missile defense (as opposed to terrorism.) At another point, a supposedly smart detective comments that highly-intelligent people are obsessed with IQ, for after all, they have a whole society built on it (Mensa.) This ignores the fact that Mensa is a fairly small organization; about 100,000 members despite being international and with a potential membership of tens of millions (2% of the whole world.) You would have more reason to look at the historic membership of the Ku Klux Klan (over a million at one point in just the United States) and claim that 'white people sure are obsessed with being white.' At still another point, a supposedly clever TV psychologist (or something like that) claims that humans revere heroic losses more than victories and uses Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo as his prime example. And to a degree that's true, Waterloo is a revered and highly remarked battle... IN ENGLAND! YOU KNOW, THE COUNTRY THAT WON THE BATTLE! By around page 100 I started skimming; the pages flew past like snowflakes but it still felt like shoveling 2-foot-high slush. Hopefully the catharsis of review will prove enough to clear my mental driveway. ...more \u0388\u03b2\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5

(7/10) ...more I would have liked to have given this novel more than three stars. After all, it has a lot going for it: an exotic setting (Oslo and Bergen are about as far away from my part of the world as it's possible to get!), an interesting hero of the flawed-and-dealing-with-inner-demons variety and a pacy narrative. Plus the fact that there is generally something pretty compelling about the better Scandinavian crime fiction. All of these factors made this novel a much more than okay read.

Plus the fact that there is generally something pretty compelling about the better Scandinavian crime fiction. All of these factors made this novel a much more than okay read. However, I can't say that I really loved it, let alone that it was amazing. That said, I suspect the problems with this novel from my point of view are more to do with me than they are to do with the book. Firstly, I identified the killer about half way through. I don't mind feeling clever when reading crime fiction, but I really don't like being way ahead of the detective and feeling that he or she has missed some pretty major clues. Secondly, I am feeling somewhat jaded with (view spoiler) [ serial killer stories in which the killer dreams up disturbingly complicated and bizarre ways of murdering his or her victims (hide spoiler) ] . I've been re-reading quite a lot of golden age mysteries recently and this may have decreased my tolerance for more extreme versions of the genre. Anyway, I liked this novel enough to be reasonably confident I will read more by its author. I didn't like it enough to want to race out and buy Nesbo's entire oeuvre or to give away copies of this particular novel as birthday presents. Recommended for lovers of Scandanavian crime fiction and crime fiction fans with fairly strong stomachs, but it won't be for everyone. ...more (3.5 stars) I usually like to start at the beginning of a series but The Snowman was getting so much hype I decided I couldn't wait to read 6 books to get there. So this was my first introduction to Harry Hole - a divorced alcoholic police detective in Oslo.

There are a f (3.5 stars) I usually like to start at the beginning of a series but The Snowman was getting so much hype I decided I couldn't wait to read 6 books to get there. So this was my first introduction to Harry Hole - a divorced alcoholic police detective in Oslo. Harry didn't seem that different from Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallender and the murder mystery plot was fairly typical of the genre. That being said, I devoured this book in only a few sittings and it kept me engaged throughout. There are a few strange moments when an obvious course of action isn't taken (a character receives a warning note and disregards it despite knowing that women like her are being murdered in the city , for example.) I wish I went into it knowing less about the Snowman calling card -I think that this story would have more surprises and suspense if you go into it cold (so to speak) - but there were several twists and turns that kept me guessing through most of the book. ...more Nesb\u00f8 creates his best novel in the series to date, placing Harry Hole and the larger cast of characters in a fast-paced race to discover Norway's first serial killer. Hole is investigating a number of murders in and around the Oslo area, after previous detectives could not find tangible clues to tie them together or offer any insight. Hole discovers that all the slain women are married mothers and that a snowman stands outside their residence, a beacon of sorts. Using the apt moniker \"The Snowm Nesb\u00f8 creates his best novel in the series to date, placing Harry Hole and the larger cast of characters in a fast-paced race to discover Norway's first serial killer. Hole is investigating a number of murders in and around the Oslo area, after previous detectives could not find tangible clues to tie them together or offer any insight. Hole discovers that all the slain women are married mothers and that a snowman stands outside their residence, a beacon of sorts. Using the apt moniker \"The Snowman\" for the killer, Hole works alongside a new partner, Katrine Bratt, and they expand the investigation, finding previous murders scattered throughout Norway. Further investigating sees Hole and Bratt discover a potential motive for the murders, children whose paternity is in question, unbeknownst to the fathers. As the case continues to heat up, Hole finds himself more drawn to Bratt on a number of levels, struggling with a past romance as well. The detectives work together and place a number of suspects in the crosshairs, only to discover that these are misdirections by the real killer. When Bratt is considered a prime suspect, Hole must fight with all he has to clear her name or detail her and stop the murdering rampage. Reconnecting with his ex, Rakel, Hole must also determine if she is safe from The Snowman, or if she could become another victim, as the killer seems focussed on personalising the act. A fabulous story that pushes Harry Hole to the brink on numerous occasions, Nesb\u00f8 keeps readers begging for more. I have been anticipating getting to this novel in the series for a while. Having heard that it is the best of the collection, I can certainly see why, with Nesb\u00f8 upping the ante from the start. The story is a compilation of many plots woven together and forces the reader not only to follow a complex murder investigation, but also subplots that do, eventually, play into the larger narrative. The introduction of Bratt as Hole's new partner harkens back to the plight of past detectives who worked alongside Hole. As the story pulls in so many directions, there is no doubt that the unfinished business left between Hole and Rakel must play some role, which substantiates the argument that she was highly important to Hole, even as many others are kept at arm's length. With his continued battles to wrestle with addiction, Hole becomes even more likeable in this story, as he pushes outside of his comfort zone to offer the reader more of a glimpse into his multi-faceted personality. Kudos Mr. Nesb\u00f8 for another wonderful book. Can we expect even more pizzazz to come in the next novel? Like/hate the review?
