The joint authors actually call their book a 'Phoetry Book', because poems and photos are blended together to create a very powerful and evocative, overall effect. I do indeed leave this book on my coffee table and can't resist picking it up and 'lucky-dipping' through the sixty different poem/photo combinations. I'd recommend it as both an essential read for anyone and as an ideal gift. It will certainly solve my 'annual present dilemma' this Christmas. ...more We saw Clive Blake performing some of his poetry at this years Fowey Fringe Festival, Cornwall UK and really enjoyed the poems and his very annimated style of performing them. He said during the performance that his poetry style was like a combination of William Blake, Pam Ayres and Tommy Cooper, I wouldn't disagree with this description.

Buy it and see for yourself!! ...more Way to much rhyming for my taste . . . . a little simplistic in places with some good pieces mixed in. A most interesting take on the world. Makes for a both enjoyable and thought provoking read. The author has a unique way with words and to match that to some first class photos was an ingenious idea. I found this book to be both entertaining and deep with humour and photos a really good read<---C>Clive Blake</---C><+++>View Points and Points of View: A 'Phoetry Book' from Cornwall</+++>", "Title": "View Points and Points of View: A 'Phoetry Book' from Cornwall"},
