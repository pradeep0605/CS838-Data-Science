Mutual Dedication In 1992, Paul Auster dediciated \u201cLeviathan\u201d to <---A>Don DeLillo</---A>. In 2003, DeLillo repaid the favour by dedicating \u201c<+++>Cosmopolis</+++>\u201d to Auster. Here is a photo of the two of them [on the left] taken at the baseball with two employees of the Gotham Book Mart by the store\u2019s owner: The Name \u201c<+++>Cosmopolis</+++>\u201d We are all used to the word \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d, but \u201ccosmopolis\u201d is less commonly used. To the extent that the prefix \u201ccosmo\u201d suggests the world or the universe, it implies that the city is representative of the diversity of the world or the universe. We can probably infer that the city is sophisticated and worldly,<---M> has an international rather than provincial character</---M>, and is home to many cosmopolitan people. If so, the term would be a perfect description for New York City, where the novel is set. It also applies to ancient Athens and Rome, perhaps the original \u201cworld-cities\u201d. Manhattan Odyssey The novel is largely set in a long white limo that drives its protagonist, 28 year old billionaire and hedge-fund manager <---C>Eric Packer</---C>, across Manhattan. Most plot summaries describe the purpose of the journey as to enable Eric to get a haircut. However, this misses much of the narrative and metaphorical significance of the journey, not to mention the haircut. The journey is more or less the whole of the length of 47th Street, which runs one-way between 1st Ave and the West Side Highway (called the Joe DiMaggio Highway since just before the publication of the novel). Climbing Down from A Cosmopolitan Triplex in the Heavens... At the 1st Ave end, you\u2019ll find the United Nations Headquarters, perhaps the centre of cosmopolitanism. Eric lives in a triplex close to 1st Ave. The building is not named, but the triplex supposedly cost Eric $104M. At the corner of 47th and 1st is the Trump World Tower, which was completed in 2001. The duplex penthouse in this building failed to sell for $58M, and was eventually split into four units. However, as at 2003, the highest price for an apartment in Manhattan was the $70M paid by hedge-fund manager Martin Zweig for a triplex at the Pierre Hotel owned by Lady Mary Fairfax (of the Australian family that published the Sydney Morning Herald and Age newspapers). Eric\u2019s purchase price represents a 50% increase on the highest price ever paid at the time. You can do that if you're a billionaire. As you drive along 47th Street, you pass the Diamond District, a number of Broadway Theatres and Times Square. Between 1963 and 1968, Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory was on 47th Street between Second and Third Aves. ...and Descending into Hell\u2019s Kitchen On the West Side, the Street passes into Hell\u2019s Kitchen, also known as Clinton (not named after Bill) or Midtown West (not named after Mae), the original home of Damon Runyon\u2019s stories, Marvel Comics' \"Daredevil\", gang wars between migrants, and the musical \"West Side Story\". The Wiki article on Hell\u2019s Kitchen recounts a number of versions of the origin of the area\u2019s name: \u201c\u2026the most common version traces it to the story of Dutch Fred The Cop, a veteran policeman, who with his rookie partner, was watching a small riot on West 39th Street near 10th Avenue. \"The rookie is supposed to have said, \u2018This place is hell itself,\u2019 to which Fred replied, \u2018Hell's a mild climate.<---F> This is Hell's Kitchen</---F>.\u2019 \" Gail Wynand, the newspaper proprietor in Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d, came from Hell\u2019s Kitchen and in Rand\u2019s novel is described as \u201cPetronius from Hell\u2019s Kitchen\u201d, a description that might also apply to Eric Packer (except that he ends there, rather than originates from there). Interestingly, the original Petronius, believed to be the author of \u201cThe Satyricon\u201d, was described as the \u201celegantiae arbiter\u201d (or the \u201carbiter elegantiarum\u201d), \"the judge of elegance\" in the court of the Roman Emperor Nero. West 47th Street has yet to be developed and still contains relatively disused and derelict buildings (including the building that features in the end of \u201cCosmopolis\u201d), not to mention the homeless and mentally ill treated at \u201cFountain House\u201d who featured in the documentary \u201cWest 47th Street\u201d. Mapping Eric\u2019s Progress I have included all of this detail (thanks, Wiki), so that I can argue that this journey isn\u2019t just some trip to the barber. It represents a journey along a street that defines the extremes of Manhattan, from the cosmopolitan East Side to the Hellish West Side. Just to help you map Eric\u2019s progress, here are the pages at which his limo passes each Avenue crossing 47th: 1st: 9 2nd: 13 3rd: 23 Lexington: 34 (the hair salon Filles et Garcon actually seems to be at 51st) Park: 38 Madison: 41 5th: 45 (The Presidential Cavalcade) 6th: 75 7th/Broadway: 87 8th: 129 9th: 130 (the Sufi rap artist Brutha Fez's Funeral) 10th 158 (the barbershop) 11th: 170 12th: 179 (the derelict tenement) This is no mere haircut, this is a low-key to subtle homage to James Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses\u201d, in which our hero leaves the Heaven of his triplex, heads west (young man) and confronts his destiny in a derelict building in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Perhaps, our hero even meets his anti-hero. Upstairs at Eric\u2019s Eric is 28 and has been married to Elise Schifrin for just 22 days. The marriage, so far, is loveless and apparently unconsummated. It represents a symbolic marriage of new American money and traditional European wealth and style, though Elise (\u201cSwiss or something\u201d) is worth a cool $730M herself. Eric has made his money gambling on movements in currencies. He takes immense risks with vast amounts of money and has generated commensurate profits. He is so rich, beyond normal moral or mortal contemplation, some would think it\u2019s indecent and obscene. In the words of his nemesis, Eric is \u201cfoully and berserkly rich\u201d. Yet, until recently, Eric has seen his ability as just an example of what the Greeks call \u201cChrimatistikos\u201d, the art of money-making. He has had talent and drive, which he has \"utilised...consistently put to good use.\" His reward is to live in \"a tower that soars to heaven and goes unpunished by God\", something that aspires to scraping the sky and meeting God, but now in a Godless era seems only to defy the very idea of God and moral virtue or goodness. He contemplates the word \"skyscraper\": \"No recent structure ought to bear this word. It belonged to the olden soul of awe, to the arrowed towers that were a narrative long before he was born.\" Just as skyscrapers have lost their narrative drive, so too have money and the art of money-making: \"...because money has taken a turn. All wealth has become wealth for its own sake. There's no other kind of enormous wealth. Money has lost its narrative quality the way painting did once upon a time. Money is talking to itself.\" Money has turned in on itself, become introverted and meaningless. It no longer tells a story about something else, it does not relate to or measure some other achievement. [The novel echoes some of the concerns of William Gaddis' \"The Recognitions\", but then DeLillo has always mined similar veins.] There\u2019s a point at which you can have so much money that it becomes senseless, there are just no more narratives or stories you can spin with it, without repeating yourself. [I haven\u2019t reached this point yet.] Checking Eric\u2019s Balance Eric\u2019s life so far has been dictated by balance. He lives in a world \u201cin which every force is balanced by another\u201d. When there is another force, he is the equal and opposite reaction. He takes positions and then waits for corrections to occur. The balancing process improves his bank balance. It also dictates his aesthetic judgments. Two private elevators rise to his triplex: in one the music is Satie, in the other Brutha Fez. He gets artistic advice from 47-year old Didi Francher, an art consultant and one of his mistresses. She\u2019s \"taught him how to look, how to feel enchantment damp on his face, the melt of pleasure inside a brushstroke or band of color.\" In a way, she has created a balance to the crudeness and brutality of his occupation. She has taught him how to reckon outside the world of money. He now looks, he notices things, he gazes, he observes, he assesses, he judges. Like Petronius, he has become an \"arbiter elegantiarum\", a \"judge of elegance\". He is obsessed with acquiring a collection of 14 Rothko works housed in the Rothko Chapel: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothko_C... He genuinely appreciates Rothko's art, but his principal motivation for the purchase is the fact that he can afford to. Such is the power of money. Consciously or not, Didi has also taught Eric how to flirt in an intellectually informed way. In his limo, he metaphorically seduces his chief of finance, Jane Melman: \"My mood shifts and bends. But when I'm alive and heightened, I'm super-acute. Do you know what I see when I look at you? I see a woman who wants to live shamelessly in her body. Tell me this is not the truth. You want to follow your body into idleness and fleshiness. That's why you have to run, to escape the drift of your basic nature. ...What do I see? Something lazy, sexy and insatiable.\" They \"[reach] completion more or less together, touching neither each other nor themselves.\" When she leaves the limo, Jane tells Eric that she \u201cis a woman who would still be married to her husbands if they had looked at her the way you have looked at me here today.\"\u201d Catching Eric Off Balance Despite, possibly because of, this transformation, Didi has noticed doubt creeping into Eric\u2019s worldview. \"You're beginning to think it's more interesting to doubt than to act. It takes more courage to doubt.\" When we meet Eric, he has gambled everything on the possibility that the Japanese Yen will fall. He has also just been told that he has an asymmetrical prostate. Without asking or knowing more about the medical significance of his diagnosis, he assumes the worst, that the cancer will soon take his life. Even if it isn\u2019t fatal, his prostate\u2019s asymmetry challenges his idealization of balance. He suffers pain. The pain undermines the foundations of his worldview. He starts to doubt both balance and himself. He starts to realise there is something in life apart from himself. He starts to recognise his own mortality. Jane addresses him in the third person: \"He could think and speak of other things but only within the pain. He was living in the gland, in the scalding fact of his biology. \"Does he love himself or hate himself. I don\u2019t think he knows. Or it changes minute by minute. Or the question is so implicit in everything he does that he can\u2019t get outside it to answer.\" Eric\u2019s nemesis (who also happens to have an asymmetrical prostate) has worked for him before and has some insight into his personality: \"You should have listened to your prostate...You tried to predict movements in the yen by drawing on patterns from nature...You made this form of analysis horribly and sadistically precise. \"But you forgot something along the way...The importance of the lopsided, the thing that's skewed a little. You were looking for balance, beautiful balance, equal parts, equal sides... \"But you should have been tracking the yen in its tics and quirks. The little quirk. The mis-shape... \"That's where the answer was, in your body, in your prostate.\" Living in the Shadow of a Doubt So I argue that the purpose of Eric\u2019s journey is to confront his own mortality, to deal with his doubt, not just to get a haircut. Until today, he\u2019s pursued business and wealth as a vehicle for achieving immortality. Vija Kinski, his chief of theory, explains: \"Men think about immortality. Never mind what women think. We're too small and real to matter here\u2026Great men historically expected to live forever even as they supervised construction of their monumental tombs on the far bank of the river, the west bank, where the sun goes down. \"There you sit, of large visions and prideful acts. Why die when you can live on disk? A disk, not a tomb. An idea beyond the body. A mind that's everything you ever were and will be, but never weary or confused or impaired. \"It's a mystery to me, how such a thing might happen. Will it happen someday? Sooner than we think because everything happens sooner than we think. Later today perhaps. Maybe today is the day when everything happens, for better or worse, ka-boom, like that.\" However, having achieved as much as one man could ever achieve in a lifetime, Eric is not interested in trying to create an immortal digital replica of himself. He is interested in his own death, because sooner or later, inevitably, we all have to accept our own mortality: \"He was alert, eager for action, for resolution. Something had to happen soon, a dispelling of doubt and the emergence of some design, the subject's plan of action, visible and distinct.\" Ironically, on the way, Eric embraces the lopsided. When he finally gets his haircut, it is asymmetrical. However, it\u2019s not the end of the journey. He resumes his trip before his haircut is finished. His goal is beyond the haircut. It\u2019s somewhere in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. On the west bank, where the sun goes down. The Threat of Death Eric knows that somewhere on his trip, sometime today, he will die. All along, he has been receiving death threats. His journey across Manhattan is the date of reckoning with his own death, the date when death achieves a balance with life or knocks it off its axis. He equips himself with a gun and abandons his security to deal with his nemesis Benno Levin single-handedly in a dilapidated building in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. By the time he arrives, he\u2019s realised that even business embraces death and destruction: \"This is also the hallmark of capitalist thought. Enforced destruction. Old industries have to be harshly eliminated. New markets have to be forcibly claimed\u2026Old markets have to be re-exploited. Destroy the past, make the future...The urge to destroy is a creative urge\u2026The logical extension of business is murder.\" Death is a natural part of life. He has to endure one last arm wrestle with fate, until he knows that he has died appropriately: \"...it was the threat of death at the brink of night that spoke to him most surely about some principle of fate he'd always known would come clear in time. Now he could begin the business of living.\" He must know and embrace his fate. It does not matter that he might die on the same day. He has already lived life to the fullest: \"This was the day, was it not, for influential men to come to sudden messy ends.\" There is also a sense in which his wealth might come to an end, that his investments will get their own haircut or at the very least, a trim. In his time of dying, the whole of Eric's empire might return, not home, but to nothing. Money might have resumed its narrative drive towards nothingness. Ironically, as the Global Financial Crisis has shown, even billionaires can die with nothing. Frames of Reference \u201cCosmopolis\u201d is short and easy to read. It occupies a discrete time and space. Rather than being DeLillo-lite or a disappointment, it\u2019s a precisely structured novel that lends itself to being filmed. As with much of DeLillo\u2019s work, it\u2019s concerned with ways of looking and seeing and understanding. If anything, I would call it a highly polished example of \"abstracted realism\". It is especially informed by Art and Film. Eric finds in Art a pathway into life\u2019s mysteries, one of them being himself: \"Don't you see yourself in every picture you love? You feel a radiance wash through you. It's something you can't analyze or speak about clearly. What are you doing at that moment? You're looking at a picture on a wall. That's all. But it makes you feel alive in the world. It tells you yes, you're here. And yes, you have a range of being that's deeper and sweeter than you knew.\" To the extent that a painting is one framed work, Film consists of multiple frames. It allows us to explore the situations that we might one day find ourselves in, it creates a frame of reference, it creates frames of reference within which to express ourselves: \"I've seen a hundred situations like this. A man and a gun and a locked door. My mother used to take me to the movies.\" \"Cosmopolis\" is best construed as a gallery of images or a film. It is highly visual and filmic, even though it's effectively set within the confines of a limo. As Eric passes along 47th Street, he witnesses a gallery of events and images and women and must gaze at and judge and react to them, so that ultimately he can determine his own importance in the true scheme of things. My only concern with respect to the film is how the dialogue will come across. How will it convey the abstracted, conceptual precision of DeLillo's language? Will it sound natural? In My State of Grace The result of Eric's movie-going is that, when he is confronted by the situation (\"a man and a gun and a locked door\", but also his mortality, his death), he knows how to deal with it. This comforts him. In his hour of need. While some of his apparent attempts at self-defence are clumsy, they seem to be designed to fail. Ultimately, what really matters is that he submits gracefully to the inevitability of his own death. It is perhaps the most graceful act of his life. And the last day of his life might equally be the most complete. There is something perfect and satisfying in this grace and completeness, even if it's a little perverse, even if it lacks symmetry, even if (unlike Leopold Bloom) Eric fails to return home to his triplex at the end of the day. P.S. Lapse or Claps, Chaps? While I love this novel, there are passages that I recognise will annoy or vindicate those who question DeLillo's talent or consistency. I choose to excuse them or to laugh instead. Here are a few examples for your reading pleasure: \"Hoisting his genitals in his hand.\" \"The minute you sat there in that whole tragic regalia of running. That whole sad business of Judeo-Christian jogging.\" \"I want to bottle-fuck you slowly with my sunglasses on.\" \"Her feet flew out from under her. She uttered a thing, a sound, herself, her soul in rapid rising inflection.\" \"Eric decided to admire this.\" \"The rain was fine. The rain was dramatically right.\" \"The rain had stopped. This was good. This was clearly what it should have done.\" \"It was the last techno-rave, the end of whatever it was the end of.\" \"He stood in the street. There was nothing to do. He hadn't realized this could happen to him.\" Sceptics, laugh with me. Soundtrack: Jimi Hendrix - Crosstown Traffic http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUwjyr... ...more I should have known!

There are some scenes I'm really looking forward to see on the big screen and some saucy lines I'm really looking forward to hear coming from Rob's mouth. Eric is like this multi-billionaire genius prince who lives isolated in his ivory tower and owns a white horse (limo). He seems to have everything, but yet he has nothing. He's bored, there is no challenge, no satisfaction, he's totally disconnected from the outside world (no friends, doesn't look people in the face/eyes, doesn't know/recognize his own wife), he has a medical condition that frightens him and he doesn't know what to do anymore. He wants to break free, to live, before he dies. He's ready to take the plunge which is pretty courageous for a control-freak like Eric and he wants to do it perfect. During his limo ride through New York, he tries to connect to the world and 'his' women, he removes all obstacles, gets rid of everything until he's stripped and is ready to face... the end. I would be lying if I say that I understand everything that's written in this book, because I don't. It's very poetic, the story has many layers, is confusing, crazy, weird and absolutely no easy read. I always take things too literally and that's why I have problems reading books like this one, but I'm still talking with others about this book and every day I discover new things. I didn't expect it, but I think it's a really interesting story and different from everything else I have ever read. My experience is that the more times you read it the more interesting it becomes. I admit if it wasn't for Rob, I would have never read it, but I'm glad I did. I think you have to see this book (and the movie) as a piece of art, you think about it, you talk about it, you admire it (or not) and never fully understand what's it all about and that's totally fine.

As evidenced by the overall pithiness, refusal to go into territory that would most likely be discussed at a quantum mystics\u2019 board meeting (do they have board meetings?), and more specifically, the seemingly insignificant (and infantile?) inquiries into linguistics and etymology, he displays his\u2026 (hold on, let me grab my thesaurus)\u2026 perspicacity, not simple-mindedness, in these fields. Our assigned protagonist, Er(obert)ic Packer(son), compulsively dwells on meanings of words. Here he \u201cpokes a note to himself about the anachronistic quality of the word skyscraper\u201d , and here asks his currency analyst, Michael Chin \u201cWhy do we still have airports? Why are they called airports?\u201d , to which Michael esoterically replies, \u201cI know I can\u2019t answer these questions without losing your respect\u201d , which makes sense in that inexplicable kind of way. Perhaps what I am trying to do, if I may provide some context from the past, is defend the Hemingway tradition (not that DeLillo's prose bears much resemblance to Papa's) against the likes of Faulkner, who shunned the former for not requiring his readers to keep a dictionary within arm\u2019s reach, but it\u2019s also something more. I am not merely, or even necessarily, saying that the easiest way to say something is the best way (a literary Occam\u2019s Razor?), but that some things can truly be so personal, harrowing, or bizarre, as to postulate nothing more than that most basic, one-word question, for which even speechless animals know, a head-tilt would suffice. DeLillo knows how to deal with complex issues using sparse, poetic language. Even Libertarians Could\u2026 Ayn Rand-ish elements may surface if the wrong pundit gets their hands on this book. If DeLillo were more of a blatant ideologue (I haven\u2019t a clue as to his political outlook), it could be frantically asserted that he had foreseen what was going to happen in \u2018Obama\u2019s America\u2019! People could be holding up copies as tea-bags dangle from their colonial hats. A book could be written entitled Don DeLillo: Prophet of Currency: How Don DeLillo Foresaw the Economic Collapse and the Ensuing Anti-Capitalism Protests of Dangerous and Disorganized Liberal Rats . Maybe in a few years. Poetry Without Inference: Our cosmic wonder is no mystical thing , and with consciousness fleeting it is no wonder to desire that it be \u201csaved from the void\u201d .

No, not dust in the wind Kerry Livgren and Native American poets, but dust in the vast quantum chasm. Or, is the horror of immortality a cyclical event? In what time of space do we, strictly speaking, even exist? Don\u2019t ask yourself these questions as you read them. It will only make you hate me. Just for Fun\u2026? Here is Brutha Fez (who is obviously DeLillo\u2019s literary alter ego) laying down some fresh rhymes: Kid used to think he was wise to the system Prince of the street always do things his way But he had a case of conventional wisdom Never say nothing the others don\u2019t say\u2026 Man gave me the news in a slanted room And it felt like a sliver of icy truth Felt my sad-ass soul flying out of my mouth My gold tooth splitting down to the root Let me be who I was Unrhymed fool That\u2019s lost but living. ...more This is book number eight on my journey to read everything written by Don DeLillo.

I have not yet read his more famous works, Libra and White Noise, though I'm kind of saving them because in a way, I know it's probably going to be 'down hill' from there. That is to say, Underworld, Libra, and White Noise are probably his best work. So I'm jumping around them. Well, I did read Underworld, but I will probably end up re-reading that one. Everyone seems to either hate Cosmopolis or just appreciate it for its stylistic prose but nothing else. And that seems to be how most people feel about DeLillo. What first drew me to DeLillo was his ability to write a sentence, to say things about the world that I had never dreamed of even thinking about, and then say them in a way that was simple, beautiful, ethereal, and complex. He is a man obsessed with words on a page: how they look, how they sound, the musicality of language. I often feel as if I am reading poetry. His later works, such as The Body Artist, Cosmopolis, and most recently, Falling Man, are becoming more and more abstract. I don't know if it's backlash from Underworld, which was massive and exhausting but in a good way, and now he feels the need to pare his work down to the bare essentials, to compress and compact his novels until he's just writing in between blank spaces. His last three novels combined don't add up to Underworld, page wise. So I gave Cosmopolis four stars. I read it in about two days. I found it oddly compelling. The language is stunning. Just really amazing stuff. And I love the events and situations he puts his characters in. I'm not saying I understood/understand what he's doing all the time, in this post-Underworld space he has made for himself, but I enjoy it all the same, and I find him inspirational, both in how I live in this world, and how I choose to place myself more clearly into this world through words on a page. I will leave you with an excerpt from the end of the book... \"The things that made him could hardly be identified much less converted into data, the things that lived and milled in his body, everywhere, random, riotous, billions of trillions, in the neurons and peptides, the throbbing temple vein, in the veer of his libidinous intellect. So much come and gone, this is who he was, the lost taste of milk from his mother's breast, the stuff he sneezes when he sneezes, this is him, and how a person becomes the reflection he sees in a dusty window when he walks by. He'd come to know himself, untranslatably, through his pain. He felt so tired now. His hard-gotten grip on the world, material things, great things, his memories true and false, the vague malaise of winter twilights, untransferable, the pale nights when his identity flattens for lack of sleep, the small wart he feels on his thigh every time he showers, all him, and how the soap he uses, the smell and feel of the concave bar make him who he is because he names the fragrance, amandine, and the hang of his cock, untransferable, and his strangely achy knee, the click in his knee when he bends it, all him, and so much else that's not convertible to some high sublime, the technology of mind-without-end.\" ...more I'm not completely sure what existential angst is, but I am pretty certain this book gave me it. And nightmares. And it made me laugh out loud in places too, and some of the language stopped me in my tracks - mostly in a good way.

In many ways it was picaresque a sort of modern-day Tom Jones journey through Manhatten, or maybe more like Alice Through the Looking Glass (meets Bonfire of the Vanities). What was so awful was that the 'vision' portrayed has already come true, and that's what gave me the nightmares, because it didn't feel like a too-stretched or too-ironic take on our world. Our fear that we're missing out, our cult of obsolesence, the constant striving for the next new thing and the next - I wish I could say it felt exaggerated, but it didn't. This sounds bleak beyond enjoyment and it was, often, but the humour saved it. I won't spoil it, but the doctor scene, and the pastry thrower had me in stitches. I'm a major fan of Don DeLillo, but he's a writer I have to take in very small doses. In fact, I'm not going to OD on very, very light romance as an antidote. I would highly recommend this - but don't read it if you're already depressed, and definitely don't read it just before you go to sleep. ...more This week I have read two Don DeLillo books; this one and White Noise, which thus far I have been too lazy to review.

This may be regarded as a strange turn of events as after reading The Body Artist (my first foray into Don\u2019s world), I had already bitterly sworn not to pick up another of his books. Anyway for one reason and another (causality :Don DeLillo books on sale for \u00a32 each in HMV) here we are and I\u2019ve read two more of his books with Underworld sitting, brooding darkly on my to-be-read shelf. If you have ever: Made a billion Lost a billion Played the markets Killed a man Married a woman you do not know Selectively read half poems in bookshops Laid naked in the street Shot yourself Then you may find it quite easy to empathise with protagonist Eric Packer, multi-billionaire, statistical genius and modern day lost soul. If not, then like me, you might struggle a bit. Similarly if you have an asymmetrical prostate then you\u2019ll be all over this one. Virtually the entire plot unfurls from within the confines of Packer\u2019s ridiculous white stretch Limo which is enroute between his 48 rooms apartment and the barbers. But that is OK because the substance contained within the white Limo is a bit ridiculous too but then that is because the space and its content are an allegory, or a metaphor or an analogy for the journey through modern life.... or something. The strife on the streets matches, reflects and gives a voice to Packer\u2019s own internal turmoil - a collective release and a ripple effect. He watches acts of anarchy on TV screens inside his Limo when the riots are taking place directly outside his window. Parker is the living breathing unattached buffered modern day man drifting through life with the trappings of things cutting of his view of the world. The confining space is matched by the sparse, sharp edged confining descriptions and dialogue which made me feel a bit like someone was taking a paring knife to my temporal lobe in order to remove extraneous matter. The words are nakedly stripped in a way which is painful to read. I won\u2019t pretend this book made total sense, much like I won\u2019t pretend this review makes total sense either. Maybe that is DeLillo causality. Don DeLillo flaps his wings in the Amazon(.com) and my reviews stop making sense on goodreads. ...more If this is your first DeLillo, back away slowly and pick up a copy of White Noise or maybe the The Body Artist instead.

(Unless you're breathless with anticipation to hear Robert Pattinson mutter the words \"I want to bottle-fuck you slowly with my sunglasses on\" while he submits to a prostate exam in crosstown traffic. In that case...well, carry on.) Cosmopolis reads as more cultural theory/critique than novel, with exaggerated but vacant characters and implausible setpieces that are really no more than conduits for DeLillo's postmodernist riffs on global economics, innovation versus obsolescence, and the mystical patterns of nature and technology. However, I'm willing to forgive Mr. DeLillo his silly plotting because his writing is so insanely compelling. At the risk of repeating myself, Dude can write a fucking sentence. Favorite moment: wading into the Spencer Tunick-style sea of nudity and - oh, why not? - deciding to join in. Runner-up, for sheer absurdity: the would-be Pie Assassin. I also enjoyed Packer's mental meta-ramblings on anachronism (skyscrapers, ATMs), the abstraction of time, and the weird temporal displacement he observes on his fancy limo monitors and - at the book's culmination - on his even fancier watch. The aforementioned prostate? It's asymmetrical. That might be all Eric Packer needs to know about his own obsolescence. Regarding the movie adaptation...color me skeptical. For me, DeLillo's genius resides in his meticulous wordsmithing, not his plots, and I can't imagine translating the sublime experience of reading him to the screen. Although if anyone can create something delightfully weird and mildly unwatchable out of this, it's probably Cronenberg. ...more Ladies and Gentlemen and you multitude of the Landless: This review would be more properly tagged/shelved \"filmed\" by myself, but seeing as how I did also read this book and maybe I'll add a second edition for a second review when I bother to re read the book.

And, quite true, I don't write film reviews. I resort to little more than the recently deceased thumbs up/thumbs down. And so, it was \"meh.\" I don't use that word \"meh\" ever to describe anything because it is an offensive word; and here I put it into quotation marks in order to distance the word use from any direct association with my evaluation; BUT that word is appropriate given the lead actor of the Cosmopolis film; his generation, his word. That piece of male plastic, lacking most plasticity, may be largely responsible for one's near total lack of impression. It's not only that teenie-boober's fault, though. Some of it is Cronenberg's. Most of it. His fault is his lack of imagination and his too strenuous adherence to the novel, a novel which is not a movie script , unlike most novels written by and for Hollywood screenwriters. It (and I believe that the antecedent of \"it\" should be \"the story\" or the DeLillo-equivalent) did not translate well to the screen, which is to say, that the translator (\"screenwriter\") wasn't really up to messing with the work of more/less genius DeLillo. But, otherwise it was a fine \"art\" film, even if it leaves one mostly flat, which is sort of the intention. Instead, much more DeLillo-on-film, is the movie Game 6 (with a much cuter and more engaging lead actor; and srsly re-watchable, at least I know I have), a much more satisfying and even optimistic movie, and I have a link in the below section of this review box. Also, it's pretty much the same story as Cosmopolis , but maybe mashed up with a few other classic DeLillo strokes like that everywhere-beloved airbourne toxic event. What follows are some words written post-goodreads-subscription about a book read pre- and mostly in regard to a film not-yet-. The above won't be very interesting either, and the below is not worth reading. [but, A Dangerous Method really was awful. just awful.] ___________ Fantastic. [I think the adjective was intented to address the BOOK. --editor] Fantastic. [ditto --editor] May we be optimistic that the film of Cosmopolis will be at least as good as Game 6?

Not often are novels of this quality bothered with by the dumb-dumbs in Holywood who make Crichton movies. If they fuck this up. . . [pessimistic updated anticipatory opinion] just saw Cronenberg's \"A Dangerous Method\" which is just awful, terrible, bad as story, as film, and now I'm of the opinion that he's not up to keeping Cosmopolis squeaky. Of other interest is the rumor that he's working on a mini-series script of The Sot-Weed Factor [this rumor is still current, and is in fact advancing --editor]. ...more Listened to this on audio during the commute and found the reader's voice really grating.

Eric Packer speaks in enigmaticisms - beautiful enigmaticisms - and his calls are often answered with similiarly wrought hooks and phrases by his trusted group of advisors. Still, Packer is what the kids these days call a douche. And, I'm certain, there are many out there who, after the past six months, have kindled a certain hatred towards anybody who dabbles in money, stylizes themselves as a financial warrior: thus Eric Packer is the perfect lamb for the sacrifice in this Age of Bailout. ...more I really enjoyed this book, enjoyed it in ways that I rarely enjoy novels.

The best summary I could give of this book is that it is the fictional version of Fooled by Randomness The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets . There are moments in DeLillo\u2019s writing when I nearly forget to breathe. It doesn\u2019t happen often, so I\u2019ll count them out for you. There is that moment in the hotel room in Americana where the script is written on the hotel room\u2019s walls. There is that couple of pages in Mao II where the women are watching the funeral on television (and perhaps the two weddings that start and end that novel too). There is also the fire at the mental institution in White Noise . These are all simply incomparable pieces of writing. If I had written any of these I think I would be able to die happy. In this novel he has stolen his greatest image from Tunick\u2019s work as documented in Naked States an utterly fascinating documentary ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259453/ ). All the same, the idea of having the central character in this novel dressed and walking around bewildered in one of these photoshoots with seemingly thousands of naked people lying on the ground about him is perhaps one of the most interesting images I have received from a modern novel in quite some time. ...more \"He said, 'My prostrate is assymetrical.' His voice was barely audible. There was a pause that lasted half a minute. He felt the subject regard him carefully, the other. There was a sense of human involvement.

Strangely this novel has received many negative reviews. Most of them compare this book against other Delillo works and feel it falls below his usual standard of excellence in prose. Having only read one, at this point, my view is very different. The novel is based on a day in the life of its main character, Eric Packer, a 28 year old brilliant Wall Street currency trader who has made billions of dollars anticipating the market trends of worldwide currency.

Most of them compare this book against other Delillo works and feel it falls below his usual standard of excellence in prose. Having only read one, at this point, my view is very different. The novel is based on a day in the life of its main character, Eric Packer, a 28 year old brilliant Wall Street currency trader who has made billions of dollars anticipating the market trends of worldwide currency. Not unlike Joyce's, \"Ulysses\" and Woolf's \"Mrs. Dalloway\" Delillo opens the story with Packer's decision that \"we\" need to get a haircut. And where he chooses to have that haircut is across town, on a busy day in NYC, complicated by a US presidential visit to the UN and the security that results in ultimate traffic gridlock. The time is April, in the year 2000, before the internet stock market bubble burst. It is within the shelter of Packer's uber-equipped limo that we are introduced to his life and his world. Packer is brilliant, obsessive to the most minute detail flashed on the several plasma screens within his limo, but has become disconnected from his humanity. Think Alvin Toffler and \"Future Shock\" 1970. Using mathematical formulas of probability and scientific physical theories of natural repetition, often interpreted in economics as a market predictor, he has become a financial wunderkind, revered and hated simultaneously, all over the world. His power is enormous. There are those that worship him, and those that hate him, both beyond reason. His trade orders can shut down economies, countries and banks and he knows it. The making of money for him is abstract and unconnected with jobs and individual needs for survival. He could care less. To him, it is a game against himself. Nothing more. And when he wins, there is no pleasure, no sense of satisfaction. It is 24/7, 365 days a year. The markets never sleep. Unable to interact socially and emotionally, Packer becomes hyperfocused on his health and mortality. His limo has EKG monitors and examining tables. And, very bizarrely, he has obsessed over an incidental observation made by a physician that he has an \"asymmetrical prostate\". This observation results in intolerable anxiety for Packer, to such a degree that he pays for daily visits by doctors for prostate and heart exams. An EKG is not a big deal but daily prostate exams? Unpleasant at the very least and his need for it is telling. On this particular day the Japanese yen's value continues to rise. Packer is betting against it, and despite the strong recommendations of his advisors, he stays on course. There are interactions, observations and events that occur over the period of his morning stuck in traffic, that threaten his well-being, both literally and figuratively. His security people tell him that there is a \"credible threat\" to his safety. Other executives in finance have been assassinated, but he dismisses their recommendations and continues on course. As the traffic inches forward he begins to thaw, his confidence wanes, and he ultimately realizes that he has misjudged the market and has brought about his own downfall. Somehow this pleases him and he ensures it by hacking into his new wife's online account and losing her several million dollar inheritance as well. He has no shame in bringing everything down upon him. Banks, corporations, world economies. This is Part 1. The second part of the book takes place in the afternoon, when his journey cross town is interrupted again by the funeral of a Sufi rapper musician he admires. He becomes emotionally overwhelmed by the display of grief and respect shown to this man by those who care for him. He finds his limo within a massive anti-capitalist, anti-tech protest, bordering on a riot. His limo is pelted with rocks and in every window he sees raging individuals. Experiencing body sobs he starts noticing storefronts and the minutiae of everyman's daily life and then reflects on the barber shop he is attempting to reach. It is where his late father took him as a little boy. He knows he has destroyed his life, and that of countless others, but there is no going back. Nihilistic, he expects to die and finds this freeing. In the course of the afternoon he kills his security guard while examining his weapon, his intentionality is unclear, but there is no remorse. And he finally meets the credible threat. This is extraordinarily well-written and timely. This was published in 2003, well before the 2009 US financial meltdown. Prophetic but deep. Had to read it three times before I could put it all together. ...more I was hoping by page 24 that the protagonist of this novel would be dragged from his limousine and beaten by children with Tickle Me Elmo dolls loaded with bricks. And then we would never hear from him again. But that ain't what happened. Unfortunately. A terrible novel by a great writer.

He\u2019s the kind of author who attempts to use long words, complex run-on sentence, and go off on long and boring tangents which really have no bearing on the novel, and any real meaning or truth to offer the reader. Cosmopolis is about a really rich guy who decided that he doesn\u2019t want to have his barber come to his skyscraper with his huge office to cut his hair. Instead he\u2019s going to take the limo across New York to have the barber cut his hair at his shop. As Mr. Rich attempts to cross town, the president is at the same time coming through with his vast motorcade, and has his life threatened by an assassin. So traffic essentially slows to a complete crawl, while Mr. Rich comfortably travels in his limo. Along the way, for some reason (probably because he\u2019s that rich!), he gets out of the car and meets people he knows, has sex with wives, ex-wives, and \u201clittle bits on the side\u201d in their car and their apartment, and all this stuff happens while he is trying to get to the barber shop; essentially about a rich guy using his riches. So if you would like to read about what it would be like to be so rich that you can get and do absolutely anything you want, read Cosmopolis, and get lost in long sentences that lead you into endless cul-de-sacs.

Dellilo's prose is highly restrained with limited, but rich descriptions of neighborhoods that unfold through the eyes of billionaire Eric. There are some truly original hilarious subversive instances where Eric displays his detatchment from society such as when he makes sexual advances to a female executive while getting a prostate exam in his back seat (No pun intended). As allegory, it holds up; the plot itself fails to hold up at times though because of the limited style he chooses with certain situations. The female characters blend into non-memorable hybrids of slut-artist-vixen-heiress-mystic. In a style very reminiscent of Chuck Palahnuik ('Fight Club') Eric's journey unfolds as his own deathmarch which Eric is all too willing to accept. The social critique is clear enough: the market culture is tainting our humanity and the democracy as corporate-kleptocracy will test what is left of it. Delillo delivers in 'Cosmopolis'.

La sua anti-odissea giornaliera nasce da un istinto, da un bisogno primario (il taglio di capelli) e finisce irrimediabilmente con la propria autodistruzione: un incubo o, per meglio dire, uno spettro omicida incombe sul boss della Packer Capital. Cosmopolis \u00e8 un racconto dalle valenze universali, un microcosmo che permette a DeLillo di inquadrare i \u2018cortocircuiti indentitari\u2019 della nostra contemporaneit\u00e0. Proprio come la protesta, che si riveler\u00e0 solo una dimostrazione della \u00abforza innovativa della cultura di mercato\u00bb , anche Eric Packer, figlio e oggetto del capitalismo pi\u00f9 sfrenato, \u00abpare aver perduto ogni capacit\u00e0 di agire sul reale in maniera empirica\u00bb (Giuseppe Genna). Lo sguardo \u00e8 costantemente filtrato da uno schermo e anche gli avvenimenti pi\u00f9 vicini sembrano assumere il loro valore solo se digitalizzati e trasmessi: \u00abIn TV aveva pi\u00f9 senso\u00bb . L'azione del protagonista, dunque, \u00e8 totalmente neutralizzata, in favore di un'osservazione passiva (l'illusione della caduta dello yen) e di una comunicazione incessante con gli altri personaggi del racconto (i brevi meeting a bordo della limousine). In un mondo in cui tutto viene \u2018mediato\u2019 e duplicato, all\u2019identit\u00e0 dell\u2019uomo in costante movimento si affianca necessariamente quella del suo specchio, del doppio che reclama il proprio spazio, anche a costo di commettere l'omicidio: \u00abMa come posso vivere se lui non \u00e8 morto?\u00bb . Ed \u00e8 proprio nell'icontro/scontro di queste due anime che, per citare un'ultima volta Masciullo, \u00abl'anima sottilmente sentimentale del vecchio DeLillo torna a risplendere\u00bb , donando a questo breve ma intenso romanzo la sua degna e tragica conclusione. ...more an oil-and-water mix of brilliance and over-bearing allegory. the good outweighs the bad. it's amazing that this book was written in 2003, because it ever-so-slightly predates the apex of corporate-greed-entropy in america. it's hard not to see mark zuckerberg in eric packer, the 28-year-old billionaire at the heart of the story. his icy, semi-autistic demeanor, technological zealotry and fascination with the movement of capital calls to mind the facebook guru immediately (they're even the same an oil-and-water mix of brilliance and over-bearing allegory. the good outweighs the bad. it's amazing that this book was written in 2003, because it ever-so-slightly predates the apex of corporate-greed-entropy in america. it's hard not to see mark zuckerberg in eric packer, the 28-year-old billionaire at the heart of the story. his icy, semi-autistic demeanor, technological zealotry and fascination with the movement of capital calls to mind the facebook guru immediately (they're even the same age as i type this). in the same breath, i'm also reminded of the 2008 financial crisis as packer's downfall unravels... not so much because it's a tragedy, but because it's the logical endgame of a vicious circle of privilege, where the very wealthy get wealthier by moving around other people's money. delillo seems horrified and fascinated by this, and he's quite good at laying out the odd fantasies that produce an eric packer - as well as the culture that's too complicit and solipsistic to bump him off of the gravy train. there's a particularly fatalistic passage in which packer's limo glides through an anarchist uprising that characterizes this perfectly. i'm excited to see what david cronenberg does with it on film. \"team edward\" could be a smart casting move after all... on the other hand, not all of it works. and parts of cosmopolis feel like an endless string of unlikely non-sequiturs. there's a digression involving a sufi rap star that's almost embarrassingly misguided (delillo has many strengths; inventing rap lyrics isn't one of them), and some of the metaphorical maneuvers are annoyingly self-conscious. but i finished it with plenty of thoughts to untangle in my head, so the bumpy ride was certainly worth it. ...more Yes, I read this book because Robert Pattinson has been cast to play the lead role in the screen adaptation. Having said that, I'm still glad I read it. I think a great deal of my issues with this as a book will be fixed in the movie. I occasionally had trouble realizing when the setting had changed, such as when Eric returned to the car. I would also have to go back and reread long strings of dialogue in order to track who was speaking each line. Both of those issues will be easy to correct in Yes, I read this book because Robert Pattinson has been cast to play the lead role in the screen adaptation.

I would also have to go back and reread long strings of dialogue in order to track who was speaking each line. Both of those issues will be easy to correct in the film because you'll be able to see those things on-screen. This is definitely a dark story and some of the financial discussions were a bit over my head, but it was still very interesting. Eric's relationship with his wife is certainly an interesting dynamic and not at all what you would expect from a marriage. Eric is certainly not great husband material. The time inside Eric's head is sometimes fascinating and sometimes nearly infuriating because of his apparent apathy. There are some shockers that you just do not see coming. On the flip side, a very major plot point begins to piece itself together early on, making the ending of the story inevitable. I'm eager to see how this book plays out on screen. It's certainly full of intrigue, money and sex. ...more Poetry pours from Cosmopolis, a sweaty rut of discourse and images about the nature of power in our world. Delillo is prescient and impactful, but he's always been, hasn't he? The protagonist finds obsoletion everywhere and the reader cringes, suddenly questioning their own utility. The ending proved blurred but effective. I sense the message within. The dedication to Paul Auster was intriguing as well. I may see the film now. After struggling through Cosmopolis: A Novel by Don DeLillo for over a year, I am very happy to report that I\u2019ve finished reading it. I\u2019m not entirely sure how I feel about it. Okay, that\u2019s a lie. I know exactly how I feel; I\u2019m just too nice to say it. Now, I admit that I only read this book because Robert Pattinson is in the movie version, which is coming out later this year.

I\u2019m not entirely sure how I feel about it. Okay, that\u2019s a lie. I know exactly how I feel; I\u2019m just too nice to say it. Now, I admit that I only read this book because Robert Pattinson is in the movie version, which is coming out later this year. And I really don\u2019t care that I thought it was kind of terrible, because as long as I have an excuse to sit in a theater for a couple hours and stare at him in a role other than a pasty vampire who does (or does not as the case may sometimes be) sparkle, my inner fangirl will be happy. In all honestly, though, the upcoming movie is not the reason I finished the book. After all, I only got two chapters in to Bel Ami, another book-to-movie adaptation coming out this year that Pattinson stars in, before I called it quits. So then why did I keep reading? you ask. Well, because I was fairly positive at some point there would be an eye-opening \u201cOh, now I get it!\u201d moment and the entire novel would become clear to me. Yeah, that didn\u2019t really happen. At all. I scratched my head until the very end. And when it was over, I\u2019m pretty sure I gasped out a \u201cHuh?\u201d as I was busting my ass on the stair machine. I just . . . I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even have words for this book. It made about as much sense as the dreams I have on any given night. How they made it into a movie, I can\u2019t even imagine. Aside from not making sense, it\u2019s all very stream of consciousness. There\u2019s a lot of thinking (weird thinking), and the sparse dialog that exists read very choppy and unnatural to me. It was also a struggle to figure out who was talking at times. I want to believe it\u2019s because I had a janky electronic copy and the paragraphs got messed up and dialog tags went missing, but something tells me that\u2019s not the case. There is, however, a positive side to having read the book: I won\u2019t walk out of the theater thinking what the f*** just happened? Also, I\u2019ll be prepared for the WTF scenes, like the rectal exam and the water bottle. And the ending. This is one of those rare cases where I don\u2019t think the book will help the movie make sense, but at least I can go into it knowing that I\u2019m not going to understand anything, and I can put more effort into ogling The Pretty. Someone on Twitter said they saw the trailer and were left completely confused. I replied by saying I read the book and I\u2019m just as confused. ...more To be honest, I had no idea a movie was out until just yesterday. Does that speak to the movie's lack of advertising, or my near-total ignorance of movies? All's well. I'd rather not have the movie affect my perception of the novel.

So we turn to the 'plot', which is a very loose definition for the series of events forthcoming, and again is a string of thoughts, reflections, and vivid events and ruminations. We see Eric Packer, a young tycoon, venture across New York in a marble-floored limousine, through presidential motorcades, a mystic-rapper's funeral, immolation, the ideological crises of late 1990s capitalism, and so forth. The Odyssey in the New York of Giuliani, of Enron, and Trump. I do not know who the actor for Packer was, so I saw instead a mask-like face, distorted by plastic surgery. Thinking and observing mostly. He ponders the deepest structural changes while aiming for the most cosmetic one - a haircut. Overwhelming streams of data and capital, and the atavistic impulse to smash it all. More of a prose-poem than a novel, really. Deliciously heavy and ominous. Fits in our world as much as it did then. Perhaps only he might have predicted the decade after. ...more El protagonista es un hombre perdido, en la gran ciudad de las p\u00e9rdidas y las ganancias.
