Before I started to write, I decided to check Randy Pausch's website for any updates on his condition. He had died that morning at the age of 47. The book, and the lecture itself, now take on new meaning. For those who aren't aware, Randy Pausch was a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University. The university has a tradition of inviting professors to give a lecture where they pretend that it is their last chance ever to talk to their students. What would you say? What wisdom would you impart? What are your lessons in life? For Randy, this was not a hypothetical question. Barely a minute into the lecture he introduced \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d: advanced pancreatic cancer that would kill him in a matter of months. With this revelation out of the way, he gave a talk about achieving your childhood dreams and enabling the dreams of others. The lecture was so full of optimism, clarity, hope, humour, and sincerity that the YouTube video went viral and a few months later it was published as a book. \u201cThe Last Lecture\u201d contains everything that Randy covered in the lecture, plus some other anecdotes and pearls of wisdom from his life and experience. Like the lecture, the book is earnest and straightforward. Randy tells a story then gives us the moral in case we missed it. He fills his stories with humour, occasionally laugh out loud. What comes across most strongly is his deep love for his wife and children who he knew he would be leaving behind. It's hard to read this book and not have a good impression of the author. He seems like a great guy, someone that you would love to have as a mentor or friend. I think this is reason that the lecture was such a success; his personality makes a watcher puts more stock in his words. This still comes across in the book, although not as strongly as in the lecture. In fact, without seeing him on video and hearing him speak the words, reading the book can almost get a bit tiring. I recall thinking on a number of occasions: \u201cOk, we know that you're a really smart guy who works really hard and never gives up, you don't need to keep telling me\u201d. Some of the advice in the book, especially that which goes beyond what he said in the lecture, can be a bit tough to swallow. For example, his advice to always carry 200$ in cash in your wallet; does he think that only the upper middle class are going to read this book? Similarly, he often speaks of the great mentors, friends, and supporters that he has had through his life; not everyone goes to a university where the professors have such extensive connections to facilitate their student's careers. Finally, his advice to never give up (\u201cBrick walls are not there to keep us out, they are there so we can show how much we want something\u201d) sometimes comes across as as sense of entitlement. He never says to expect something for nothing, but does imply that anything you want to achieve is possible if only you work hard enough at it. Advice like this sometimes crosses the line into sappiness and glurge. Fortunately these moments are fairly rare, and as long as you don't read the book in a single sitting (which is quite possible) then you probably won't feel too overwhelmed. Interestingly, shortly after I watched the last lecture on YouTube a student of mine asked me a similar question to the topic of the last lecture. What do I consider my most important lesson in life so far? It is quite a difficult question to answer. I'm sure that I don't have the life experience to give a good enough answer, but it's quite possible that this student was bright enough to recognize that and learn something from the incompleteness of my relatively uninformed response. I hope that someday I can have the kind of perspective that Randy shows in the lecture and the book. We need people like Randy, who have a clear picture of what they have learned in life and who are willing to share it. Regardless of whether you or I agree completely with his advice, what shines through is that this was a man who lived his life according to principles that he believed in, and that he thought others would benefit from hearing. His life, lecture, book, and his death remind me of a quote from Dr. Howard Thurman: \"Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive\u201d. Even as he lived the last few months of his life, I know that Randy was truly alive. ...more My review of this book will not be popular, but I must be honest. I'm halfway through this book, and although I appreciate a positive voice, it's really not that interesting or helpful. If I could sum up this book in three words, they would be \"yay for me\".

Yes I realize it was born from a lecture, but maybe every life, achievement, and event in this world doesn't necessarily need a book to be made about them. Having said all negative stuff, Mr. Pausch sounds like a good guy. ...more While this man has a 5-star attitude, I can only give the book two. yeah, everyone is raving about this guy...

I applaud the great attitude he takes to enjoy the time he has left and focus on what matters. But is this earth shattering? Is any of this a surprise? ...more I think this was one of those books where knowing the criticisms before starting it ultimately upped my enjoyment factor. Randy Pausch, the author, was one of those people who became wildly popular in 2008 thanks to the internet. He was a popular professor at Carnegie Mellon and was invited to give a \u201clast lecture\u201d, a tradition of sorts where a professor is urged to give a specially prepared lecture as though it were the last s/he were to ever give.

And so they are encouraged to break down all the knowledge learned in their lives and during their careers into one hour-long presentation and say, \u201cthis is the best of what I know, here you go.\u201d But for Randy Pausch, his Last Lecture became somewhat of a sensation because shortly before he was scheduled to give his presentation, he learned that he had late-stage pancreatic cancer and he only had 3-6 months left to live. Throughout it all, he remained very upbeat, he was charismatic and his nerdy persona was infectious. And so copies of the lecture spread and spread and spread over the internet and suddenly Pausch was an overnight sensation. Only in America. :) Given his shortened life span at the time of publication, I can understand why the book felt so rushed. There are some chapters that are little more than a couple paragraphs with a random anecdote that doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with anything. And many of the longer ones appear to be run-ons. About halfway through the book I realized that each chapter of this book reminded me of a blog entry. Then I realized that that may be some of the appeal to this generation, because as a piece of literature, this book is just\u2026well\u2026no. This book came highly recommended to me by my sister and my mom who love it. My mother-in-law has read this book and also loves it. And at the time I write this review, 8,197 4-star and 5-star reviews on GR and there are fewer than 500 ratings that are 2 stars or less, so Pausch\u2019s story has clearly touched the lives of a lot of people. Since discovering this site, I almost always scan some of the top-vote-getting reviews before starting a book. Whether someone loved it or hated it, I\u2019m always curious to know why. And in the case of this book, since there were so many glowing reviews, I found myself focusing on the negative ones if only because they appeared to be in the minority and the minority has always intrigued me. Most of the complaints had to do with: --the fact that Pausch sucks as an author --Pausch\u2019s personality --what did this guy do so differently that he actually deserved a book? --the book is too preachy --it\u2019s too Hallmarky --it\u2019s too Disney So going into the book expecting these faults, I found myself focusing on what is probably the most important thing about this book: Randy Pausch (who isn\u2019t alive anymore) had three children under the age of five who may not remember that once upon a time, he was their father who loved them very much. And realizing that this year, next year, five, 10, 15, 45 years from now, his children will still have a record of who he was and what he stood for (whether I agree with all of it or not) is an unbelievably beautiful thing. My husband was a teenager when his mother died unexpectedly and years later, we still have items in our home that belonged to her: a set of water-color paintings she\u2019d had since college, a hand-written recipe on a post-it note, a baby book full of hand-written notes and stories and photographs. Having that connection to the past is a tangible reminder not only of what was lost, but of where we come from. And losing a parent before their time makes that connection even more powerful. And so I can\u2019t help but feel glad and happy for Randy Pausch\u2019s children because they will grow up knowing that their dad\u2019s life inspired so many millions of people. I hope that will be a tremendous source of pride for them. They can\u2019t have their dad, but the legacy he left them was the best he had to offer in the short amount of time he was given to work with. ...more I was first \"introduced\" to Mr. Pausch while watching the Oprah show in the fall. My father in law was in the hospital at the time, fighting melanoma that had metastacized to his lungs. Simply stated, I stopped folding clothes and cried so hard during that show. Soon after, the emails began to circulate with links to the last lecture on utube and I watched every link I got and cried even more. I read all the internet articles and was touched every time.

Soon after, the emails began to circulate with links to the last lecture on utube and I watched every link I got and cried even more. I read all the internet articles and was touched every time. When I saw the book was coming out, I jumped on board and knew I had to read it. I never knew how emotional this book would be for me. The day (August 15, 2007) Randy Pausch got the devistating news that his cancer had spread and there was nothing the doctors could do anymore, is the same day that we arrived at MD Anderson with my father in law, knowing things were not right. I came across this in the book and had to put it down for days. This was just hitting too close to home for me. I finally was able to pick it back up and continue. This book and Mr. Pausch's stories are so touching and true that we can all find something in there that will help us want to be a better person. We can all find some bit of wisdom that can be carried into our lives. I cried so many times reading this, but I laughed several times too! Anyone who has had their life touched by cancer will benefit from the optimism Mr. Pausch has, but it will be a very difficult read just because of the seriousness of the issues at hand. Just the sheer optimism in such a negative world is very uplifting. I ran across several quotes from the book that I felt were so important that I needed to use my trusty post it notes to mark them for future reference. Here they are: Pg. 51- \"The brick walls are there for a reason. They're not there to keep us out. The brink walls are there to give us a chance to how how badly we want something.\" Mr. Pausch refers to the brick walls so many times, but it is so true! pg.111- \"Time is all you have. And you may find one day that you have less than you think.\" This has been a major realization in my life this past year. We thought we had so much time with my father in law. And we lost him so quickly. Take the time to do the things you want and never put them off. pg. 119- \"Luck is indeed where preparation meets opportunity.\" This goes back to my old Girl Scout motto \"Be prepared.\" pg.148- \"Experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted.\" Glad to know I've gotten something! And now it makes sense. pg.156- \"A lot of people want a shortcut. I find the best shortcut is the long way, which is basically two words: work hard.\" Wow! If we could all stop taking the shortcuts and work a little harder, could imagine what might happen?!?! pg.159- \"All you have is what you bring with you\" This is the chapter title and it sure says a lot. ...more No doubt Randy Pausch was a nice guy. But this book is smarmy, self-indulgent crap--which is ok given the circumstances under which he gave this lecture. But it is not worth reading. This is typical 1980's individualistic, unreflective advise on how to succeed in life. Alas, Professor Pausch does not realize that he was born white, male, middle income, in exactly the time in the 20th century where he could avoid confronting WWI, WWII, the depression, Korea, Vietnam, urban riots of the 1960's, the No doubt Randy Pausch was a nice guy.

And he got to miss all of the problems of Bush 1 and Bush 2 in the middle east because he was too old and affluent. So he has the privilege and lack of social awareness to totally ignore the entire social context that provided and constructed his wonderful, if unfortunately short, life. Thus he leaves out the advise that was most important to his success. Have the pre-natel intelligence to be born male at the right time, in the right place, to parents who are racially privileged citizens of a superpower in ascendance during a brief window of peace at a time of expanding educational opportunity for middle-income working people in an expanding economy. Then these individualistic platitudes, if you are also very, very fortunate, may possibly help--but then again, they may not. Nice guy, sweet sentiment, save your money. ...more It's hard to criticize a dying man.

For those who are not familiar with this 2008 bestselling I am writing this review with barely 4 hours to go before 2013. I picked this book up to inspire me to face another year. I learned about this book when I took our company-mandated safety leadership training last month. Our corporate safety manager talked highly of this as he related Randy Pausch's very personal experience with what one person's ultimate objective in life, i.e., what should really matter to each of us in the training room. For those who are not familiar with this 2008 bestselling book, Randy Pausch (1960-2008) was an American computer science professor who died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 47. At the time of his death, he left his three small children aged 6, 4 and 1. He learned about his condition in Sept 2006 so he was able to use his last 22 months to prepare. The highlight of this preparation was his last lecture delivered in the university where he used to teach, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. That last lecture is basically what this book is all about. The book is divided into 6 parts: (1) the last lecture; (2) his six childhood dreams that he basically achieved prior to his lecture; (3) various anecdotes that taught him life lessons; (4) how he inspired others to achieve their dreams; (5) his list of advices for better living and (6) his final messages to his family - 3 kids and wife Jai. Overall, the book had that inspiring effect on me but it was far from mind-blowing. I think I've read too many similarly situated characters in both fiction and non-fiction works that I found Pausch's situation less heart-wrenching. Fact: people die everyday and Pausch's condition was a lot better than the people who had to die here in the Philippines. Why Pausch was even able to buy a brand new house and lot for the family he was leaving behind few month's before his eventual death. Very few of us in a third-world country would be able to do that. So, this is not to criticize Pausch and his better life situations were not his fault, it's just that I found it harder to empathize with him. There are a lot of worse situations around here in our country. His writing is also less moving that those written by non-writers during the last years of their lives. I even found the memoir The Time of My Life (3 stars) jointly written by Patrick Swayze (1952-2009) and his wife Lisa Niemi detailing Swayze's fight against the same kind of cancer more engaging and interesting. For one, The Last Lecture at times seems too self-absorbed as Pausch talks about himself, himself, himself. This only stopped in Part 4 but very briefly. I am not judging Pausch but looks like he was telling the truth that he was self-centered and took highly of himself, e.g., finishing other people's sentences, when he was still young and healthy. That's why that part where he was supposed to tell how he was able to inspire others was short and somewhat less affecting. I thought that it would have been better if Pausch hired a seasoned writer to assist him in writing the book. The idea of the book was a surefire hit but he sounded mostly preachy and self-absorbed. His better life situations than most of us have alienating instead of engaging effect at least for me. If I could leave those luxuries to my family and achieve that celebrity status, I would have been happy to trade places with Pausch and die with smile on my face anytime. Overall, I liked this book still because of some important reminders that I was able to pick up: (1) Live simple life - don't buy things to impress others (2) Never make a decision until you have to. (3) Even if in a position of strength, whether at work or in relationships, you have to play fair. Just because you're in a driver's seat, doesn't mean you have to run people over. (4) Parents should make their love known to their children. They don't need to be alive to do this. (5) If your car has a dent, you don't have to have it removed. It could be a statement of who you are. Not everything needs to be fixed. (6) Don't finish someone's sentences. And talking louder or faster doesn't make your idea any better. (7) If you wait long enough, people will surprise and impress you. (8) Not what they do, not what they say. (9) Whether you think you can or can't, you're right. (10) A lot of people want a shortcut. I find the best shortcut is the long way, which is basically two words: work hard. (11) Proper apologies have three parts: A) What I did was wrong B) I feel badly that I hurt you C) How do I make this better? If there is one lesson that I consider the best advice I got from Randy Pausch, this should be it: (12) If I could give three words of advice, they would be \"tell the truth.\" If I got three more words, I'd add: \"All the time.\" Happy New Year everyone! I wish you more books, books, books! ...more The Last Lecture, literally, for a professor with a terminal illness.

When I look at the picture on the back cover of the book, showing the author with his kids, I think, \"that's the audience to whom one should devote their last days\". To pull oneself away from family at such a time and dedicate so many hours to developing a final lecture, one would expect that lecture to contain profound insights or world-changing revelations. I didn't find that here. No doubt this book will be treasured by the authors friends and family, for the personal insights and memories, but I wouldn't recommend it to a broader audience. ...more I'm appending this with the review I wrote for my paper: http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08097/...

I read this because I am doing continuing coverage on the author, a Carnegie Mellon University professor who is dying of pancreatic cancer and who gave a last lecture that has been viewed on the Web by more than 6 million folks. For what it is -- essentially an expanded version of the lecture about his life story and his advice on how to live a fulfilling life which can all be read in a sitting -- it is very good. It's highly readable, in part because of Randy's own communication savvy and personality, but also undoubtedly because of the crafting it got from Wall Street Journal columnist Jeffrey Zaslow. Most of the things I highlighted were items I didn't already know from the lecture, but in any case, here are just a couple tidbits. As a professor, Randy would put his students in teams and everyone would give feedback to the other team members on how well they were doing, particularly in their ability to work well with the group. He recalled one student who, when told he was in the bottom quartile on the feedbacks, was sure that he was near the top of the quartile, which meant he really wasn't that far from being 50-50 on people skills. That's when Randy said the kid was at the very bottom. This answer shocked the student, but Randy said \"I used to be just like you. I admit it. I'm a recovering jerk. And that's what gives me the moral authority to tell you that you can be a recovering jerk, too.\" In a segment on the importance of hand-writing thank you notes, this otherwise completely high-tech guy recalled one instance where an applicant to his master's program in entertainment technology didn't quite have the grades or accomplishments to make it in, until he found a thank you note she had written, not to any of the program leaders, but to a support person who had helped her make arrangements for an on-campus visit. It turned the tide for her. \"She came to the Entertainment Technology Center, got her master's degree and is now a Disney Imagineer,\" he said, which is his idea of the ideal job. It's not all homilies and advice. When describing the strength and love of his wife, Jai, who will be left to raise their three preschool-age children, he talked about how his cancer diagnosis had given him the time to have vital, open conversations with her that wouldn't have been possible if he had died suddenly. He talked about how well she was coping and how she was doing it without the attention and even adulation he has been receiving. And then he revealed that when he gave his last lecture and surprised her with a birthday cake, and she came on stage to kiss and hold him, what she whispered in his ear was: \"Please don't die.\" That made the book as real and powerful to me as anything else. So even if you're not normally drawn to self improvement books or memoirs, try this one: It will give you a lot to think about on what your life's priorities are and what you might say to the people you love if you had to leave them behind.

This book is right up my alley in my latest/favorite reads or movies watched; Animal, Plant, Vegetable (Barbara Kingslover), Into The Wild (movie), and now The Last Lecture. The book is about Randy Pausch, also the author, who is diagnosed with terminal cancer and has 3-6 months to live. With that information, he decides to take part in writing a Last Lecture for Carnegie Mellon, where he is a professor. After much thought, he decides to write about \"living\". About what he is leaving his 3 very young children and his wife. About how he lived his life and fulfilled his childhood dreams. About what matters most to him and how influences have shaped who he is. And of course, what he can leave his family for the future without him. It's a reminder to all parents, young and old, that you never really know when your time is up. That you cannot take for granted each and every day. To cherish your family, your friends, your children, and your wife/husband. It's a reminder about dreams no matter how big or small can be achieved if you truly believe in your self. It's a reminder to us all to be \"who we really are\" and let all else fade away. It's a reminder that all brick walls can be scaled. It's a reminder of many things in our lives - it's Life's Little Lesson Book and I will keep this one handy because there are things that reminded me that I need to do...starting now!

I realize that the author is trying to cram all that he has found to be important in life in 200 pages, which is automatically going to make it seem preachy.

I'm not sure that calling the admissions office at the college one wants to attend but didn't get into every day until they finally say ok, we'll take you is a good plan, or much of a claim to fame. Wearing others down until they give in is not overcoming obstacles in your path; at best, it's jumping the line and at worst it's blatantly disrespectful. Since the author did not mention choosing battles wisely, I'm left to assume that this is his behavior all the time. I have the kind of imagination that makes me extrapolate out the idea of overcoming brick walls; if everyone thought no meant try harder, the chaos would be incredible. ...more I enjoyed watching his last lecture, which was extremely touching, but reading this book was even more touching. I actually teared up numerous times while reading it. As far as I'm concerned, this guy is a hero. He was happy, and yet he achieved so much. He was diagnosed with cancer, and instead of just letting it put him down, it was a motive for him to leave this last lecture, a lasting legacy.

It's one of the top gift books of 2008, if you didn't yet view \"The Last Lecture\" on YouTube you probably heard about it via Oprah or friends or co-workers: a talented computer science prof at Carnegie Mellon with three adorable little toddlers and a loving wife learns he has pancreatic cancer and about six months to live, so he gives a farewell lecture to his students, I will probably burn in hell--well, okay, suffer a few extra millenia in purgatory, maybe--for only giving this book two stars. It's one of the top gift books of 2008, if you didn't yet view \"The Last Lecture\" on YouTube you probably heard about it via Oprah or friends or co-workers: a talented computer science prof at Carnegie Mellon with three adorable little toddlers and a loving wife learns he has pancreatic cancer and about six months to live, so he gives a farewell lecture to his students, his university, and the world, to give us some life guidance before he passes away. He's a smart man with a beautiful family and a great job. And now he must deal with death--the Grim Reaper we must all ultimately confront. But he chooses to be upbeat, and empowering, using positive energy to help us all be better folks. Why then do I not like this book?? There's something about the way he does it that strikes me as being knowingly and calculated self-focused on his part, even while he claims he is trying to only reach and help others. I know I should cut him some slack--my God, the man was dying, he is dead now as I write!--but the whole set up of the lecture, and then the book that reworks a lot of the lecture, is to make us feel incredible pity even as he tells us not to. He tells us in the beginning of the lecture it won't be about his wife and kids and how much he loves them--but of course that's exactly where he ends, so we are totally consumed in sympathy and crying our eyes out at the end (if we have any compassion at all). As a cathartic reading for families and caregivers dealing with terminal illness, this book could probably be an effective salve, but as a homily of wisdom for the ages (or common sense to live by, take your pick as it works as both) this book offers many of the same platitudes one would find in any wise sermon or self-help essay. A lot of these pearls of wisdom are offered here, again and again, within a framework of \"see how great I was\" or \"see how great my family was\" or \"see how successful I have always been.\" He does share that in college he was thought of by many as a self-centered jerk, that some had acccused him of the sin of arrogance. I suspect that as much as he tries to adopt the voice of an Everyman and claim we could and should all adopt his maxims of wisdom, I see some of that old arrogance that he probably still retains as he tells anecdote after anecdote where he turns out the star. I can tell he was a very good teacher who truly cared about his students. You can easily see how much he loves his kids, and he keeps re-iterating this whole \"Last Lecture\" and then the follow-up book marketing campaign were really supposed to be gifts to them. Perhaps if he had been a bit more honest about how much personal pleasure he got out of all this limelight and attention at the end, that indeed a good part of this was to make himself be the center of attention one last forceful time, I would have felt even more respect than I already have. But if you've seen the video, I really don't think you need to read the book. And if you do decide to read it anyway, consume it in small bites--don't read it straight through in one sitting, as I did. The advice (which is often quite sensible and praiseworthy) will probably go down easier, and remain with you longer. ...more I arrived late to the parade -- sadly, the first I ever heard of Randy Pausch was when his obit ran on CNN.com late last month.

The bulk of the story centered around the \"last lecture\" that made him famous well beyond the halls of the universities where he taught and in the scientific realm. A few nights later, a guy who took the seat next to me on the train home was reading the book Pausch and Jeffrey Zaslow put out based off his lecture. I gave it a few glances out of the corner of my eye and decided it was probably something I needed to read. This book could easily be read straight through, although I do most of my reading on the train and in increments. That served me well with The Last Lecture because it gave me time to pause and think over all the little life lessons and pearls of wisdom contained in Pausch's story. Short chapters also helped and provided for moments to stop and pause, which I needed not only to let what I read sink in but also at times just to keep composure, as I don't carry a box of tissues with me on the train and there were points (especially in the final segment of the book, appropriately titled \"Final Remarks\") when I was perilously close to needing them. Pausch recounts learning of his terminal illness, the time leading up to the lecture and the lecture itself, which he named \"Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams\" and expounds upon in the book. Everyone is likely to take something a little different from this book -- which is why everyone at some point should try to read it -- but the biggest thing I took was the brick wall concept. The brick wall might represent a situation in life or even a relationship with another person, but Pausch makes it clear: \"Brick walls are there for a reason. They give us a chance to show how badly we want something.\" Although the advice given is very simple at times -- kind of in the \"everything I needed to know I learned in kindergarten\" vein -- it's nonetheless given with sincerity and the wisdom that comes with putting every bit of living possible into 47 short years. I'm actually kind of glad I read the book when I did ... Pausch undoubtedly inspired many people during his life, I got to be near the top of the list of people who will be inspired by his words after he died. ...more \u062f\u06a9\u062a\u0631

mean literally it's only slightly longer than my hand and contains little over 200 pages. When I first saw it, I was surprised and asked my mom, \"that's it?\" to which she responded, \"yeah, he wrote the book because people were asking for it, he wanted to spend more time with his family, not writing a book.\" Of course after hearing that I was like duH!

If you have absolutely no clue who Randy Pausch is or have never heard his \"last lecture\" do yourself a favor and google him. This guy is amazing. For all of us who love to read quotes about making the most of our lives, living in the moment, etc - this guy is doing it. Not to say that there aren't plenty of other people out there doing the same, but Randy Pausch has now touched the lives of thousands because of his story and his determination to make the most of his final days with his family. The book is basically a recap of some of his actually presentation of \"the last lecture,\" but it's definitely worth reading. I mean I could watch his lecture over and over. The guy is inspirational and I was fighting back tears while reading the book. It's a quick read and you don't want to put it down. He makes you laugh, cry, smile, and really evaluate life. I pray for his family, but I know they'll be left with such a great legacy to remember him by. ...more Kamis kemarin, saya iseng pergi ke gramedia, niat hati sih mau beli Rolling Stone ama M2 edisi terbaru, sekalian cuci mata liat2 buku baru.

Cara diet menurut golongan darah. Gak menarik\u2026 The secret bla bla bla. Kebanyakan rahasia, males ah\u2026 The last lecture, pesan terakhir pengidap kanker ganas yang mencuri perhatian dunia. Buku apa? Kaya pernah tau bapak ini\u2026 Sepertinya menarik, tergeraklah saya untuk mengambil buku ini, kebetulan ada satu buku yang terbuka bungkusnya lalu saya baca kata pengantarnya dan langsung jatuh hati dengan buku ini. Baru saya ingat, Randy Pausch yang notabene profesor sempat saya tonton di Oprah, tapi sekilas aja. Saat saya mulai membuka buku ini, saya tidak bisa meletakkannya. \u201cJika kita harus mati besok, apa yang kita inginkan sebagai pusaka kita\u201d Bab pertama yang mengisahkan masa kecil Randy yang menurut saya luar biasa. Keluarga yang mengedepankan arti pendidikan dan tidak menanamkan budaya konsumtif, bandingkan dengan jaman sekarang. Baru kali ini saya tahu, keluarga yang tiap malam membuka kamus dan membiarkan anak-anak menggambari dinding kamarnya. Orang tua Randy selalu berhemat, tidak seperti banyak keluarga pada umumnya, mereka tidak pernah membeli sesuatu untuk membuat orang lain terkesan, tapi mereka dengan gembira membeli seri World Book. Sepertinya alm.Randy menerapkan teori the secret jauh hari bahkan jauh tahun dari buku itu dibuat. Ia mengajarkan saya bagaimana kita harus hidup dalam mimpi, dengan segala iman, keyakinan dan kerja keras, mimpi bisa menjadi nyata. Impiannya melayang di udara, bermain di liga sepakbola nasional, menulis artikel Ensiklopedi World Book, menjadi kapten Kirk dan perekayasa dalam Walt Disney hampir semua menjadi nyata. Wow\u2026 Amazing\u2026 Suatu kali, Randy menjemput 2 ponakannya yang berumur 7 dan 9 tahun dengan mobil anyarnya. \u201cHati-hati ya, di mobil paman Randy, seka kaki kalian sebelum naik dan jangan buat kotor\u201d, pesan sang mama. Sementara sang kakak membeberkan aturan, Randy dengan tenang dan perlahan membuka sekaleng soda, membalik kaleng itu dan menuangkan isinya ke tempat duduk belakang. *Gila, pikir saya* Pesan Randy, manusia lebih penting daripada benda. Mobil, bahkan yang masih murni dan indah hanyalah benda. Hal yang dasar banget dan lucunya kadang saya lupa dengan ini, bolak balik marah kalau adik saya mengacaukan kamar atau melecekkan buku baru saya. Itu baru buku, bukan mobil lho mia\u2026. Hal lain yang membuat saya tertohok waktu membaca buku ini, disebutkan terlalu banyak orang yang menjalani hidup sambil berkeluh kesah tentang masalah yang mereka hadapi. Saya selalu yakin bahwa jika kita ambil sepersepuluh energi yang kita curahkan untuk mengeluh lalu kita gunakan untuk memecahkan masalah, kita akan terkejut melihat betapa lancarnya segala sesuatu berjalan. Setiap waktu yang kita butuhkan untuk merengek tidak mungkin membantu kita mencapai tujuan. Juga tidak akan membuat kita lebih bahagia. Saya ini termasuk orang yang dengan mudahnya mengeluh dan tidak selalu bisa berpikiran optimis. Mungkin dibanding Randy saya sekelingkingnya pun tidak ada dan dia masih bisa menikmati hidup dengan optimis. Bab terakhir mengisahkan tentang kuliah Randy yang diakhiri dengan adegan Jai (istrinya) dan Randy berpelukan, selagi berdekapan, Jai berbisik, \u201cPlease, don\u2019t die\u201d Oh My God, can\u2019t help my self, saya menangis. Tepatnya menangis tersedu2. Saya menangis waktu membaca Cheerz to Life, Tuesdays with Morrie dan Ways to Live Forever yang notabene kesemua buku itu berkisah tentang hidup yang sangat dekat dengan yang namanya kematian, tapi saat saya membaca buku The Last Lecture ini saya tangisan saya yang paling dahsyat sepertinya ;) Pagi tadi saya membuka websitenya, thelastlecture.com dan ternyata tanggal 25 Juli 2008 beliau telah mengakhiri pertandingan dengan baik. Rest in Peace, Randy\u2026 Saya percaya banyak manusia yang diubahkan dengan membaca ataupun menonton kisah hidupnya. God bless you and your family. ...more Updated review 31-March-2016: That kind of books; you cannot write a fair review about!", "Title": "The Last Lecture"},
