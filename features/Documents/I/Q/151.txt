After some very funny moments on book one: some huge changes due to meaningful love triangles: And the lost of a very important friendship: we get to Darcy's and Ethan's book and let me just say: OMG I LOVED THIS BOOK! I had already fallen in love with the characters in it after watching the movie based on Something Borrowed , but now I can certainly say that Darcy and Ethan were the real deal. While Rachel and Dex were great, Darcy & Ethan just gave me so much more than what I was looking for. At the beginning of the book we get a totally immature heroine, just a brat who is used to get everything she has ever wanted and just the way she wants it, not having a care for what happens to others while she achieves what she wants. Of course this kind of behavior brought her some problems eventually. She ended up pregnant with an ex-fiance who left her for her ex-best friend, and a boyfriend who she cheated the ex-fiance with who also will leave her eventually. Not even her parents gave her any support once they found out she was pregnant. Once this happens, she realizes the world she built for herself was totally superficial, shallow and vain and she just doesn't know how to really make things better. Seriously, she has no clue as she doesn't actually comprehend what's wrong on the first place. The only way she found to make things a bit better was running away to England to her childhood only remaining friend Ethan. Now here is where things started to get really good. Sigh, I just have no words to describe the amazing relationship they built together. They were just perfect for each other, total opposites but the type who makes you become a better person. I just loved how both changed for the better by living together. Seriously, it was just so good to see their friendship growing and to see how both made important changes in their lives with the advises the other gave. While both of them were romantically involved with others we can see how the affection and feelings between them are always present. This is a book which analyzes feelings, realities of life and life itself.<---F> I just LOVED it so much</---F>. I guess we needed to see how Darcy was at the beginning to fully comprehend everything it took her to change and become the woman she was always meant to be. Although more than anything I just adored to see how important the support of a real friend can be. I do admit the first half of it was a bit slow. It took me some time to warm to Darcy. I kinda hated her at the beginning. Although that feeling was what made me love her so much at the end as seeing her being such an ungrateful and spoiled person made possible for me to really appreciate the changes she went through. Really this book was just so sweet and both characters went through so much together, I loved how they were always there for each other. I'm someone who doesn't like chick-lit much and who hates cheesy and corny more than anything but this book is so much better than that, It's realistic and gives us so much to learn. I definitely recommend it. **sigh, it has been a long time since I feel like this towards a book. Warning: I do believe necessary to watch the movie (<---B>or reading book 1</---B>) before reading this book, I know it wouldn't have been the same if I hadn't. watching the movie helped me so much to imagine how the characters would look like while saying and expressing certain things making it much more compelling to me. ...more Okay, so I hated that this book focused on Darcy and not Rachel. I left Something Borrowed really hating that character. 254 pages in, and I still thought she sucked. The plot was fairly predictable--you knew she was seeking redemption in the novel as well as with the reader, and the ending was equally predictable. I loved the focus on Ethan as he was one of my favorite characters from Something Borrowed. I was completely resistant to the movement as I knew where this was going,<---M> and I simply did Okay</---M>, so I hated that this book focused on Darcy and not Rachel.

I loved the focus on Ethan as he was one of my favorite characters from Something Borrowed. I was completely resistant to the movement as I knew where this was going, and I simply did not want it to go there. Griffin achieves her goal by making the reader, resistantly, start to at least like Darcy a little more. And, I will willfully admit, I was tearing up during the Epilogue. I'd still like to see a novel that returned the focus to Rachel, but I know why the author went the route she did. It was simply too easy. By making Darcy the very hated but ultimate hero of the second book...Griffin takes a resistant reader and makes her unwilling to put the book down. I finished these two novels in 1.5 days...again, worth a good day at the beach/pool/on the couch. ...more <+++>Something Blue</+++> is the follow-up to Something Borrowed. This story is from Darcy's point of view. I loved this book and it is a very quick read. I have to admit I hated Darcy in Something Borrowed and even did at the beginning of <+++>Something Blue</+++>. I felt that she was finally getting what she deserved when everything started to go down hill for her. Part of me even started to feel sorry for her at her lowest points. What I liked in this book, is that Ethan, her childhood friend, finally pointed out Something Blue is the follow-up to Something Borrowed. This story is from Darcy's point of view.

What I liked in this book, is that Ethan, her childhood friend, finally pointed out to her what type of a person she really is. No one had ever done this to her and his words really hit home. Darcy decided to change herself for the better. This book follows Darcy through her pregnancy and journey to be a better person. I felt proud of her as the book ended to see what she had done with her life and how much she had changed for the better. ...more I was blown away by this book. If you hate the main character when you start reading, don't worry, you're supposed to!!!! But, keep reading because the story is incredible and you will learn to root for <---C>Darcy Rhone</---C> whether you like it or not! Fantastic read!!! (Be sure to read \"Something Borrowed\" first or this book will not make as much sense) Spoiler Alert: Some of the other reviews I have read of this book are very cynical regarding Darcy's transformation...however, the reason Darcy transforms I was blown away by this book.

(Be sure to read \"Something Borrowed\" first or this book will not make as much sense) Spoiler Alert: Some of the other reviews I have read of this book are very cynical regarding Darcy's transformation...however, the reason Darcy transforms is because she has no other choice! Everyone in Darcy's life had always catered to her every whim because of her physical beauty. She had always gotten exactly what she wanted and never had to think about the consequences of her behavior. However, after everything that takes place in Something Borrowed, in addition to her relationship with Marcus, dismissal of Claire and her mother, she is forced to reevaluate her behavior when Ethan finally sets her straight. She has no one to depend on and Ethan sees through her crap! He forces her to look at life differently and to realize that she was not the victim in everything that happened....he also forces her to realize that she can no longer get away with her shallow behavior....she no longer had everyone wrapped around her little finger and therefore she had to become a new version of herself. Maybe I am just not as cynical as other readers, but I truly believe that this type of transformation is possible given the circumstances of Darcy's story. ...more Premise is way better than the first book. This is the follow-up to Something Borrowed told from the perspective of the best friend Darcy. In the first book, we meet Darcy and learn that she is the beautiful best friend who has everything handed to her on a silver platter. After her plain-jane best friend, Rachel, steals her perfect fiance in the first book, you feel like Darcy got a good dose of karma. She did, after all, cheat on her fiance too and ended up pregnant while still engaged.

She did, after all, cheat on her fiance too and ended up pregnant while still engaged. I almost didn't want to read this story, simply because it was from Darcy's perspective. However, I really liked this book much better than the first. I found myself really rooting for her. And you also come to realize that not everything is as it seems for Darcy. She may be the beautiful girl who seems to get everything she wants, but she is extremely self-conscious despite being so judgemental of others. She does learn the error of her ways and really tries to turn her life around, now that she is pregnant and alone for the first time in her life. The ending left me very satisfied and surprisingly, left me crying happy tears for Darcy. ...more 4.5 stars I didn't like Something Borrowed , so it is sort of surprising to me that I loved it's sequel! Loved it! This book is about Darcy, the self-centered friend from Something Borrowed. One of the main reasons I liked this book better, was that Darcy seemed like more of a real person than Rachael (the main character in S B) did. Darcy had always led a charmed life.

Loved it! This book is about Darcy, the self-centered friend from Something Borrowed. One of the main reasons I liked this book better, was that Darcy seemed like more of a real person than Rachael (the main character in S B) did. Darcy had always led a charmed life. She learned young that because she was usually the most beautiful girl in the room, it often afforded her a certain amount of power over everyone else. However, she always thought that she was fairly benevolent with that power. And, honestly, Darcy was never evil . Self-centered, materialistic, and unthoughtful, yes...but not really cruel. To her, this meant that she deserved all of the good thing that came her way. Why shouldn't she always get what she wanted? So it came as quite a shock to her when she found out that her perfect fiancee had fallen in love with her plain-Jane best friend. Never mind that she was cheating, too. Never mind that she was planning on breaking it off with him, as well. Never mind that she was pregnant by one of the groomsmen. Darcy had always secretly competed with Rachael, but this was the first time she ever lost. And because of her subsequent behavior, she loses everything else. This is a story about someone who has to take a hard look at themselves, and ends up discovering who they really are. More importantly though, who they really want to be. I think almost everyone can relate to this story. No, not everything , obviously, but I think most of us have been like Darcy at one point in our lives. We all think that we're the good guy in our story, until something happens that knocks us down a peg (or two). And once you take a good hard look at what happened to land you in that position, you tend to discover that, well...maybe you weren't such a great person, after all. So, maybe that's why I thought Darcy seemed real. I can relate to that . ...more 2nd half of Rachel and Darcy's story. **SPOILER** - I was disappointed in this book. It was on ok read, but there's no way I believe that selfish, spoiled, self-centered Darcy would change after one wakeup call argument with Ethan. And...Darcy seemed to want Ethan to love her and when that's not enough she needs her Doctor to fall for her, then when he wants her she decided she loved Ethan. Wayyyy too unbelievable.

And I wasn't overly happy with sweet Ethan either. He's certainly had Darcy all figured out and gives Rachel his version of Darcy as a friend in the first bk (Something Borrowed), then Darcy shows up at his doorstep in this bk and they become best pals. That development would have never happened if Darcy hadn't been so needy. Seemed like the only pull selfish Darcy had on Ethan was that he got screwed over by Brandi and missed out on being the dad he thought he was going to be so Darcy's handy and needy and he can be those babies daddy. Felt like Ethan and Darcy settled...a more or less love the one you're with. Also was surprised that Darcy who was supposed to have had this big epiphany that changed her can't make the first step to forgive Rachel and extend the olive branch. It had to be Rachel. Was glad Dex stood strong on his cool towards Darcy. Rachel was just too nice and Darcy a huge bitch. Something Borrowed \u2013bk 1 wasn't neat and tidy but an enjoyable read. A reality but almost like a car wreck you can't help but stop and look at. I was riveted as to how it would all end. Although they felt a little guilt you were left with Rachel and Dex very happy with their outcome and you wanted the best for them. True love the hard way. Something Blue got all tied up in an unbelievable pretty bow. No thanks. ...more I was looking forward to reading this book. I had just finished an excellent book and was ready to start another. Boy was I in for a shock! This book was bad. It was actually a chore to keep reading, but I hate to leave a book unfinished. My husband was actually hiding the book around the apartment so that I wouldn't have to read any more of it. This book is chick-lit at it's poorest.

To be fair, any book that is published with the chick lit logo is going to have an impossibly perfect, Bridget Jones becomes the princes bride ending so I should\u2019ve managed my expectations accordingly. But Giffin does such a perfect job of creating the quintessential character everyone loves to hate (Darcy) in the first book, that my cup of loathing runneth over upon starting the second book and no matter how much Darcy grew up, I still wanted her to end up deformed and talking with a keyboard a la Stephen Hawking. But like I said, this is chick lit so obviously this does not happen. Rather, in \u201cSomething Blue\u201d we get the rest of the story from Darcy\u2019s perspective, which ends up being one of the more irritating and whiney narratives I have ever read. For 200+ pages the reader is treated to a diatribe of \u201cpoor me poor me, I\u2019m Malibu Barbie\u201d only to be followed up with 100+ pages of incredulous poppycock that quite honestly had my eyes rolling into my head so often I\u2019ve memorized the pattern of veins in my lids.

The Darcy we meet in the beginning of this story is the same manipulative, selfish bitch that we saw in the first book, but I gotta say - there was a certain frankness, an honesty to her narrative (something that I found completely lacking in Rachel\u2019s), and I couldn\u2019t help but be drawn to it.

Darcy\u2019s beauty has been the source of her confidence ever since she can remember, it shaped her personality and defined who she was. She acknowledges this and is completely unapologetic in her extremely shallow outlook on life. In this book, however, she reaches a point where she is forced to face some hard truths about herself, and in the process, reevaluates everything about her life. The ending was sweet and made me go \u201cawwwww\u201d, but overall, I thought the second half felt too rushed and I had a hard time buying into a big part of it. (view spoiler) [ Darcy\u2019s transformation happened way too fast - I wish more time had spent on this part of it and much less time on the Darcy-Marcus part of the storyline. (hide spoiler) ] I would have rounded my rating up had it not been for that. ...more I enjoyed this book much better than Something Borrowed. Maybe because I knew of Darcy from Rachels point of view and was anxious to see what she was really like. The story flowed much better than the previous book and there was never a dull moment in this one and the ending was just perfect. A quick easy read. I was able to read this book in two sittings. \u2605\u2605\u2605 The first half of this book is awful! Darcy is one of the most vile characters I have encountered in a book, and she is the heroine. She is self-absorbed, amoral, deceitful and vindictive. She is an all round awful person. She cheated on her fiance, her lover leaves her and her friends have all abandoned her. And that's the first half of the book. At the lowest point in her life and pregnant, she travels to London to stay with a childhood friend and hopefully get her life in order.

Well I came very close to giving this book 4 stars even though 50% of it was a complete train wreck for me. ...more So, even though I didn't love Something Borrowed, the ending was so sudden, I felt compelled to finish the story by reading Something Blue. I have to admit that I hate drama queens in real life, and Darcy is all about creating drama in her life. For the first portion of the book, I focused on how, as a character, Darcy was exactly as I remembered her from before. She was obsessed with figuring out how someone could not love her the most, and destructive in her competitiveness.

For the first portion of the book, I focused on how, as a character, Darcy was exactly as I remembered her from before. She was obsessed with figuring out how someone could not love her the most, and destructive in her competitiveness. After a very well given wake-up call, she starts to change the outward problems, but that doesn't necessarily lead to inward changes as well. Giffin leaves out a chunk of time in Darcy's progression from self-centered competitor to loving mother, and I felt ripped off that I put up with the crappy character only to get short changed on her maturing. I liked it better than Something Borrowed, where I definitely felt more connected to Rachel, but judging it on its own, it was definitely just 2 stars. Now I can say I've read Giffin without having to read any more. ...more Este libro me gusto mas que el anterior por la sencilla raz\u00f3n de que Ethan es un AMOR y porque el cambio de Darcy (aunque bastante rapido) se lo merece.

Me dio mucha pena como ella fue quedandose sola en un momento tan trascendental, sobre todo como la propia familia la dej\u00f3 sola y de Marcus ni hablar.....y a su vez me dio alegr\u00eda que ella pudiera tomar todo lo que Ethan le ofrecio desde que lleg\u00f3 a Londres y aprovecharlo para bien sin dejar de ser Darcy. Y por \u00faltimo en este libro pude ver lo que ya sospechaba desde el libro anterior, que Darcy fue la que mantuvo firme la amistad con Rachel, la que la impulso y por mas que sea obvio que Rachel quiere mucho a Darcy y la extra\u00f1a, sigo pensando que el alma de esa amistad era Darcy y por eso tanto dolor de su parte. Me gusto el final, se dieron las cosas que me faltaron en el libro de Rachel y fue todo muy dulce. Al final me termine encanri\u00f1ando con Darcy, jijiji!! Y de Ethan no digo nada mas porque la verdad que es tan perfecto en todo lo que hace que se merece que lo lean, es divino, ahhh me encant\u00f3 el detalle de los nombre de los gemelos. ...more I really liked Something Blue!! I would have given it a 4,5 if I had the option. It is the sequel to Something Borrowed, which I truly enjoyed reading as well. I was expecting this sequel be about Darcy and Rachel's relationship but in Darcy's voice. Although their relationship is developed in this book it is not the main focus. This story focuses more on Darcy's feelings and emotions. \u00a0I was ready to hate Darcy because she is so shallow and superficial, but to my surprise I loved her!!

Sure, she made me roll my eyes more than once, but as the story goes on, I felt sorry for her and as she matured I began to really love her. \u00a0Ethan is more present in this book, which is a good thing because I liked him very much in Something Borrowed and wanted to read more about him. I found myself wanting to know a little bit more of what happens to the other characters from Giffin's first Novel: Rachel, Dex and Marcus. Although, you find out a little bit about them, I was left wanting more. Especially about Rachel, I missed her in this book. Just when you think that you have the story all figured out, there are a few surprises that you don't see coming, which made this book even more enjoyable. The author wrote the perfect ending for the book. I recommend this book to anyone who's looking for a light, easy read and liked Something borrowed. ...more One of my all time favorites. This and Something Borrowed. At the end of SOMETHING BORROWED, Rachel\u2019s life seemed to be on the upswing, while her ex-best friend Darcy\u2019s was going downhill fast. Darcy was pregnant with Marcus\u2019 baby, while she found out that Dex, her ex-fianc\u00e9, had been having an affair with Rachel\u2014that traitor!\u2014for the whole summer.

Darcy was pregnant with Marcus\u2019 baby, while she found out that Dex, her ex-fianc\u00e9, had been having an affair with Rachel\u2014that traitor!\u2014for the whole summer. It\u2019s enough to give any girl used to luxury, comfort, and coddling (like Darcy is) a major migraine that even a shopping spree won\u2019t help. Darcy intends to marry Marcus and raise their baby together, but when Marcus refuses to have anything to do with her, Darcy, panicked and out of options in what once was the opportunity-filled New York, decides to go stay with her childhood friend Ethan in London. So she packs up most of her clothes and toiletries and jets over to Ethan\u2019s tiny basement flat, sharing his bed with him. At first, Darcy is having a blast in London, what with all the new shopping that she can do and all. Who needs Rachel and Dex anyway? But a big fight with Ethan opens her eyes to all her faults. Despite his stinging words, Darcy realizes that he has only spoken the truth, and vows to turn her life around, for herself, her unborn baby, and Ethan. And changing herself turns out to not be very difficult at all. She finds a gynecologist, Geoffrey Moore, but very soon switches doctors after she and Geoffrey start being an item. Geoffrey is everything Darcy had ever wanted in a man: handsome, rich, smart, caring. The perfect gentleman. Which is just as well because Ethan has started to see someone too. But although life in London is turning out just as she imagined\u2014finding the perfect man to take care of her and her child\u2014something is just not right. Darcy can\u2019t seem to pinpoint it out, until, over her baby\u2019s security, she realizes that maybe she was with the wrong man. That maybe she had never been in love before until this moment, and that the man she loved was right next to her and just might love her back. As always, Giffin does an envious job creating real, complex characters and helping them grow into better people. In SOMETHING BORROWED Darcy was the me-me-me girl who wanted and got everything and who got on your nerves, but here she is a genuine heroine who you can grow to love and cheer for. ...more OK, let me start off with saying I liked it. I finished reading it and I didn't hate Darcy. Here's the thing: The ending was perfect. It was sweet, sentimental and delightful. As a regular reader of romantic fiction, it was great. But I don't think the setup is real. The Darcy from Something Borrowed, the Darcy that starts this book would not have been so affected by Ethan's \"take down\" which was really a gentle conversation. Maybe she really was altered by being dumped twice in such a short peri OK, let me start off with saying I liked it. I finished reading it and I didn't hate Darcy. Here's the thing: The ending was perfect. It was sweet, sentimental and delightful. As a regular reader of romantic fiction, it was great. But I don't think the setup is real. The Darcy from Something Borrowed, the Darcy that starts this book would not have been so affected by Ethan's \"take down\" which was really a gentle conversation. Maybe she really was altered by being dumped twice in such a short period, but I've known real people, who after all that happens just thinks it's the fault of fate, or the other person or blah blah blah. I can't see Darcy just switching gears one day. Maybe she could. Maybe she'd be smart and realize she'd gotten a second (third, 100th) chance with Ethan. Maybe their friendship was more important than the made it appear previously. Maybe Ethan did like her more than it appeared in Something Borrowed (where it seemed that he was around her because Rachel was). But I didn't buy it. Darcy's relationship with Ethan was lovely, and I appreciated it for all it's sentiment. I just wish it felt real, and not just some story told to make us think that she was saved by love. (and yes, that comes to you from a die-hard, I believe in love, romantic wishing type of girl. Maybe my pragmatic side is working overtime, but my romantic \"this is bull\" meter was pinging off the hook.) ...more So I read this, the follow-up to \"Something Borrowed\" , this morning. It follows narcissist Darcy after lifelong-best-friend Rachel steals her fianc\u00e9 Dex. And while it was great to see Darcy's development as a character, I didn't feel like this book was quite as eventful as the last one. Maybe it's just that I find pregnancy to be less exciting than l-o-v-e.

And while it was great to see Darcy's development as a character, I didn't feel like this book was quite as eventful as the last one. Maybe it's just that I find pregnancy to be less exciting than l-o-v-e. Still, Darcy holing up in London but not really knowing anyone didn't provide the same opportunities for learning experiences/drama as if she'd stayed in New York (where Rachel and Dex live). At least there's a happy ending. Loyal, reliable Rachel, my best friend of twenty-four years, who always had my interests ahead of, or at least tied with, her own, had-- WHAM! POW! --sucker punched me. Blindsided me. The surprise element of her betrayal was what burned me the most. The fact that I never saw it coming. It was as unexpected as a seeing-eye dog willfully leading his blind, trusting owner into the path of a Mack truck. ...more I almost didn't read this book when I realized that it was going to be from Darcy's perspective. That would have been a huge mistake! At the of Something Borrowed I could not stand Darcy's character so I couldn't bear the thought of reading a whole book about her, I continued to have that feeling as I started reading this book. Then suddenly you get these glimps of a good person and you feel yourself actually feeling sorry for her and then before you know it you are cheering for her!

Then suddenly you get these glimps of a good person and you feel yourself actually feeling sorry for her and then before you know it you are cheering for her! This was an awesome series (Something Borrowed & Something Blue) I can't ever remember totally changing my opinion about a character like I did with Darcy, Emily Giffin did a fabulous job of creating two so completely different characters within one. I loved this book and am very excited to read more from her! ...more Given how much I enjoyed the first book in this duo, \"Something Borrowed\", I was under the assumption that this next book would be a slam dunk. And truth be told, the first half of the book fit the bill. Darcy, the main character, really gets what's coming to her and I applaud that. Revel in it, even.

And truth be told, the first half of the book fit the bill. Darcy, the main character, really gets what's coming to her and I applaud that. Revel in it, even. She lost her fiance and her best friend in the previous novel, and continues this selfish downward spiral by losing her second best friend and her parents once she announces her illegitimate pregnancy. Her narcissism eventually costs her the relationship with the father of her child, at which point she really hits rock bottom, with absolutely no one on her side. The book takes a wrong turn for me upon Darcy's decision to fly to England and crash with childhood friend, Ethan. We were introduced to Ethan in the previous book, so suffice it to say that I was under the impression that he harboured strongly negative feelings towards Darcy, since he tends to side with her ex-best friend, Rachel. The story then becomes about Darcy's realization of how selfish and self-centered she has been and her determination to make things better. And of course, once she 'decides to be a better person', her life completely and magically turns around. She finds rich and intelligent friends as well as a rich and handsome boyfriend that she eventually dumps for Ethan. Because somehow in all this mess, she decides that she's in love with him. They get married and live happily ever after, Darcy forgives all the parties that wronged her, yadda yadda. I think my main discomfort with Darcy's fairy tale ending is that Emily Giffin hurls you all this information in the space of five or six chapters at the end of the book. I felt that Darcy's transformation would have been more believable had it taken more time for her to find it, and honestly, had she struggled a bit more. This all does happen during the time of pregnancy, which is to say less than a year. I found it a little hard to swallow. I enjoy Emily Giffen's writing style and the voice she gives her characters in her novels, but I have to say that her previous novel was quite better than this one. ...more All I can say is .....WOW, July 22, 2008 I read this book with low expectations. I had read Baby Proof by Emily Griffin and found it to be somewhat average. I read this only because the reviews were so high. (and I haven't read Something Borrowed Yet). It is a wonderful, touching story about an initially, selfish, superficial woman who worries too much abou having the best, being the best, the most loved, most wanted etc. She has an affair with her fiancee's friend really to prove that he wants he All I can say is .....WOW, July 22, 2008 I read this book with low expectations. I had read Baby Proof by Emily Griffin and found it to be somewhat average. I read this only because the reviews were so high. (and I haven't read Something Borrowed Yet). It is a wonderful, touching story about an initially, selfish, superficial woman who worries too much abou having the best, being the best, the most loved, most wanted etc. She has an affair with her fiancee's friend really to prove that he wants her more than her friend or anyone else. She ends of pregnant. Her wedding is called off and she finds her best friend (RACHEL) is part of the reason for it being called off. Bitterness overcomes her she finds herself alone, shamed etc. Not knowing what to do, she goes to London to be with an childhood friend, Ethan, to get away from it all. In part to make people worry, in part to make her Rachel jealous of her being with their mutual childhood friend, Ethan. As time goes on Darcy, you can see Darcy changing. Analyzing what's important, what matters and what really doesn't matter. It's a story about true love and how a single person can change everything and how you look at the world. It's a story about friendship, letting go of the past, and forgiveness. Darcy changes a lot up until her delivery and of course, changes even after that. A really believable, well written tale that warms your heart. I listened to the audio version (unabridged) and it was fabulous. The narrator does an exquisite job of capturing Darcy and you can really hear the subtle changes in her and the book progresses....Delightful. I can't wait to read Something Borrowed, which unfortunetatly, does not come in audio....but can't wait to find out the back story.....I would definetly recommend this book. A lovely story. ...more It's hard to say what I thought of this book on its own, but as a sequel, it was very good. While I was not a fan of Darcy's character in the first book, in fact, I was happy about everything that happened to her, I loved her character so much in Something Blue . The story really showcased a beautiful transformation from a selfish woman faced with enough obstacles to really swallow her pride and grow up.

Either way, I found myself approving of the ending and loving the fact that Darcy was happily reunited with everyone important to her (hide spoiler) ] If you liked Something Borrowed , I highly recommend this novel. It's a beautiful sequel and has some great character development from some characters we only caught a glimpse of in book one. ...more In this sequel to Something Borrowed, Darcy takes centre stage. Despite her bitchy attitude and snide personality in Something Borrowed, I still found her a much more interesting character than the boringly Dex-obsessed Rachel - her beau stealing story was interesting, sure, but I was glad to move on to Darcy's side of the fence.

So we get to see Darcy's skewed view of the world, all the while learning where her shallowness comes from so that you can sort of forgive her for her insensitiveness and root for her. Griffin has a way of bringing out the emotions in her books. I felt the heartbreak, love and joy throughout this novel as if it was happening to me. She takes a situation and makes you reminisce on what it felt like when you were in her shoes. It also works on making the characters realistic, even if the story lines aren't always. As a chick-lit, there's bound to be some fairy tale scenarios, and this one is no exception. Everything falls nicely into place. Which was fine by me because I was expecting it. Some might find it too unbelievable. I thought it was cute and fun to read. ...more I doubt this sequel will be made into a movie. Darcy is irritating through most of the book, which bites since she's the narrator. Though I was slighty intrigued to read her perspective on her outrage at Rachel, I was disappointed in how long it took to get to anything else interesting. The Marcus/Darcy stuff was drawn out, but I pushed through waiting for my favorite character to emerge.

Thankfully, I didn't have to wait too long for Ethan to tell off Darcy. What disappointed me the most was the rushed way in which the characters come to the resolution of intense friendship and love. I was hoping to see more of a change in Darcy. Though there was some change and final eight pages were sweet, I still didn't see what she offered other than a pretty face, her babies, a great need to be wanted and a talent for sex. Her character hadn't progressed enough for this reader to want her with the best character in the series. Oh well. Guess the pretty girl wins afterall. ...more She still a real bitch until chapter 20. I hated her. Like really really bad. Then, she changes. But for real. She becomes a good person for Ethan. It's unbelievable! Ethan is the best person on earth and they fall in love for real. It's not about sex or if he's the most handsome men on London. I celebrate her change.
