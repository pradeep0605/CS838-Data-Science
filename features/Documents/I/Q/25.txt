Clockwork Prince is different from Clockwork Angel in many ways. For starters, it contains more romance. There is even cheating. Furthermore, secrets are revealed. Many of them. The pacing is slower and the focus is sharp on the characters and less so on the actual plot. And it\u2019s also more treacherous.

Sixteen-year-old Tessa Gray is taken to Poets' Corner by someone who understands exactly what such an experience will mean to her, and this lovely little moment in the sequel to Clockwork Angel perfectly encapsulates everything I love about the Infernal Devices series.

Sixteen-year-old Tessa Gray is taken to Poets' Corner by someone who understands exactly what such an experience will mean to her, and this lovely little moment in the sequel to Clockwork Angel perfectly encapsulates everything I love about the Infernal Devices series. Tessa is a shapeshifting Shadowhunter who is becoming accustomed to her powers, but in the middle of all the magic and mystery in Victorian England, the relationships between Tessa, the enigmatic Will, and the thoughtful, sensitive Jem remain the very heart of the story. Following a rather, ahem, provocative prologue, the story really begins as the London Institute of Shadowhunters is given two weeks to find the evil Magister, who is still determined to gain control of Tessa\u2019s powers and bring down the Enclave. Tessa and the Shadowhunters must battle dreadful clockwork creatures, demons, and even treachery within their own ranks before everything around them is forever altered. Readers who agonized over the last book will be happy to know that we see the beginnings of the ties between the Lightwood and Herondale families, find out what the initials \"JTS\" mean, and spend more time getting to know all the characters, including Magnus, Jessamine, Henry, Charlotte, and Sophie. Here are the other important elements that I loved from this story: Tessa, Will, and Jem Tessa becomes more sure of her unique position and powers, and her relationships with both the boys in her life deepen in a life-changing way. Jem unexpectedly reveals an incredibly alluring side to him that we\u2019ve never seen before, and we finally discover the devastating secret in handsome Will\u2019s tragic past. This is one of the most well-written love triangles I\u2019ve ever read, with a strong girl torn between two very attractive and honorable boys; there are good reasons for Tessa to love them both, but also excellent reasons for her to give her heart to neither. It is nothing short of torture to feel Tessa\u2019s deep pull towards Jem and Will, both of whom have swooningly romantic and wildly sensual moments with our heroine. Believe me, the infamous Dirty Sexy Balcony Scene more than lives up to its promise, and I clutched my pearls more than once while reading this book! What Tessa never forgets, however, is that as confused as she is about her feelings for Jem and Will, there is also a lifelong friendship between them that she must honor. Jem\u2019s illness, Will\u2019s love for and dependence upon him, and her own need for self-respect all contribute to an intensely difficult situation, and one that made me hurt for everyone involved. Victorian Details The Victorian details in this novel make me quite ill with pleasure. That's right, ill with pleasure. I'm not even speaking solely of catnip such as the clothes and carriages and the like, but of a finer, deeper authenticity that has to do with a way of truly immersive thinking, rather than just trifling details. It seems to be so difficult for many YA historical fiction authors to refrain from projecting anachronistic modern attitudes onto period characters, but Tessa Gray stands out as a true Victorian heroine. She shows courage and spirit, but it's within the appropriate behaviors and thinking patterns for a girl living in the 19th century; if she breaks tradition, she thinks about it (and we know it's unusual) before she does so. Even while she's being trained for self-defense by other Shadowhunters, Tessa spends a great deal of her time struggling to reconcile her magical powers and responsibilities with her upbringing and social decorum. The role of women in oppressive circumstances has always interested me, and Tessa\u2019s internal dialogue and conduct (along with Sophie\u2019s) are notably in keeping with all the other spot-on period details, which are meticulously researched and beautifully woven into the story. Before she began writing this series, the author rather famously moved to England for six months and read nothing but books written or set in the Victorian era, and even walked all the streets that her characters might have traveled. There is a certain mood and style that is decidedly steeped in the foundations of this research, and the dexterous language and witty dialogue feel pretty nearly perfect and true to the time\u2014with allowances for fantasy and magic, of course. Tessa transcends the thinking of the time and uses clever magic and thinking to outwit her adversaries at every turn. A Love of Literature Another thing I also adore about this series is how much appreciation all the characters have for literature. I still remember the awe I felt the first time I went to Westminster Abbey, and it struck a chord to hear Tessa say, \u201cI can\u2019t explain it. It\u2019s like being among friends, being among these names.\u201d Upon traveling to the countryside for the first time, she also says, \"I feel as though I have seen it before. In books. I keep imagining I\u2019ll see Thornfield Hall rising up beyond the trees, or Wuthering Heights perched on a stony crag.\u201c It is nearly impossible for any lover of books, particularly those with an unruly bit of romance in her soul, to fail to thrill when reading words like this. Tessa is a kindred spirit for me, and I think she would be for many other thinking, dreaming readers as well. If you were dying for this second installment in the Infernal Devices series, rest assured that it has been more than worth the wait. It's full of great action scenes, a clever use of magic, and the hilarious dialogue that we've come to expect from these characters. It is, however, also an intensely emotional read for those invested in the characters, so be prepared with tissues\u2014I cried several times near the heartbreaking end and it's going to be so hard to wait another whole year for Clockwork Princess . Was the book satisfying? Yes. Was it agonizing? A thousand times, yes. But it was painful in the most exquisite and emotionally truthful of ways. This review also appears in The Midnight Garden . An advance copy was provided by the publisher. ...more Liked Clockwork Angel better than the Mortal Instruments, that's why I am eagerly awaiting the next installment in the Infernal Devices=] December 2011 is too far away!! Can't we just read it now? Huh... It seems people are already choosing sides... So, in that case, I'll admit that I am...

Why have I written these words in this book? Because of you. You taught me to love this book where I had scorned it. When I read it for the second time, with an open mind and heart, I felt the most complete despair and envy of Sydney Carton. Yes, Sydney, for even if he had no hope that the woman he loved would love him, at least he could tell her of his love. At least he could do something to prove his passion, even if that thing was to die. I would have chosen death for a chance to tell you the truth, Tessa, if I could have been assured that death would be my own. And that is why I envied Sydney, for he was free. And now at last I am free, and I can finally tell you, without fear of danger to you, all that I feel in my heart. You are not the last dream of my soul. You are the first dream, the only dream I ever was unable to stop myself from dreaming. You are the first dream of my soul, and from that dream I hope will come all other dreams, a lifetime\u2019s worth.

They could be honest with me, and I with them. Reading your words, what you wrote, how you were lonely sometimes and afraid, but always brave; the way you saw the world, its colors and textures and sounds, I felt--I felt the way you thought, hoped, felt, dreamt. I felt I was dreaming and thinking and feeling with you. I dreamed what you dreamed, wanted what you wanted--and then I realized that truly I just wanted you.\u201d ____________________________________________ If you know me and my reviews , you would know that I am not a fan of sequels,especially second books of the series but this one was entirely awesome.I have been caught up with series for weeks now and I can't think of anything else.The way it is written is so beautiful and I do dig the appearance and the style of talking of the time this book,actually the whole series is set in.Maybe as a fan of books,as a reader I do enjoy books in which dialogues are filled with quotes of classics.Quoting the brilliant authors is one of the smartest way of creating conversations and I must give the credit for this to the author.She handled this perfectly,staying in reality and not turning it into something artificial as some popular books out there had done it. ____________________________________________ \u201cIt was books that made me feel that perhaps I was not completely alone. They could be honest with me, and I with them.\u201d ____________________________________________ The way author describes the situation is terrific,the way the characters show their emotions,their affections,eagerness,sympathy fits greatly with their culture at the certain time.Also you can sense skepticism on their thoughts,actions affected by feelings,inexperience,and age.You get to read here about great heroic characters,fearless and strong,but it's something about them and the things they repeatedly do that makes them real and believable.It makes them people. ____________________________________________ \u201cThey say time heals all wounds, but that presumes the source of the grief is finite\u201d ____________________________________________ I must say I enjoyed this one more than the first one.Not that it was better than the first one in the plot or the writing,or anything in general but if you may know me,you would know my public dislikeness for vampires as creatures,and this one fortunately doesn't contain blood drinkers.So I am pleased. ____________________________________________ \u201cIf no one cares for you at all, do you even really exist?\u201d ____________________________________________ Even that there is not a lot of action or much happening in this book,it never got boring.The plot was beautifully organised and the situations were always thrilling filled with excitement.There are some secrets revealed,but still the plot is quite complicated stored with enigmatic words and ideas and persons in shades. ____________________________________________ \u201cWe live and breathe words.\u201d ____________________________________________ (This may contain spoilers) I was quite impressed with the Will's curse,and the revelation of it.And it surely change my opinion for this character. ____________________________________________ \u201cYou\u2019re seventeen,\u201d Magnus said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have wasted a life you\u2019ve barely lived.\u201d ____________________________________________ I can't part this book.As the first book,this one was also a perfection in every way.I can't say I didn't enjoy some parts more than others but the difference is minor so I will not mention them because I don't want to spoil. The story This book follows the story of the first one.After the death of the vampire and the unknown location of the Magister ,the shadowhunters are caught up in a lot of problems.Charlotte is doing everything to save the Institute,to stay at the head of it,Tessa is still clearing things in her head,trying to find more about herself and who she is,her origin,her parents.Her heart starts growing more feeling for Jem,because of this kindness and everything but in the other hand she can't stop feeling affection for Will and his dark,dark past. ____________________________________________ \u201cLies and secrets, Tessa, they are like a cancer in the soul. They eat away what is good and leave only destruction behind.\u201d ____________________________________________ The characters Tessa Well I still have the same opinion for her.All the best.And I don't know why but I never have imagined someone more beautiful than her in my mind.And she has a sense of humor.Like that's something easy to find,beautiful and funny. Will Well as I said my opinion for Will has changed.Not that I have disliked this characters before but after knowing him better,I do feel pity for him.I still don't know why he hasn't tried to find the demon before,I mean for five years he could have find it and know better and he would not be late,and who has read this book knows what I mean. James I also have the same opinion about this characters as before.But I do have a feeling that he knows what Tessa truly feels.I guess I have to find out in the third one. Magnus Bane I am mention this character because I can't really understand him..He has done a lot of generous things for others,but I can't really know what he likes or desires.It confused me a lot and maybe it's just me, but I think he has some problems and I find him very creepy. ____________________________________________ \u201cOh, leave it,\u201d said Jem, kicking Will, not without affection, lightly on the ankle. \u201cShe\u2019s annexed my plan!\u201d \u201cWill,\u201d Tessa said firmly. \u201cDo you care more about the plan being enacted or about getting credit for it?\u201d Will pointed a finger at her. \u201cThat,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second one.\u201d ____________________________________________ I highly recommend this book to every book reader out there.It's a phenomenal series.It contains everything you want to see in a book.So pick the first one up and then this one:) ...more **Don't click the spoilers if you haven't read the book.** I think it's time to admit to myself that The Mortal Instruments and Infernal Devices series are just not for me. I suppose it's not a secret I'm not a huge fan of Cassandra Clare's work, but I won't deny that there were some things I did enjoy with each series. However, this was a disappointing read for me. I originally liked the premise of the first book in the Infernal Devices series, but this installment seemed to focus more on the ch **Don't click the spoilers if you haven't read the book.** I think it's time to admit to myself that The Mortal Instruments and Infernal Devices series are just not for me.

I originally liked the premise of the first book in the Infernal Devices series, but this installment seemed to focus more on the character's relationships rather than the plot. It's the same problem City of Fallen Angels had, except I do think Clockwork Prince was LOADS better than that. In Clockwork Prince The Shadowhunters in the London Institute find themselves in a serious bind. Due to the startling turn of events in Clockwork Angel , Charlotte is threaten to be removed as head of the institute unless she and the others can discover what the Magister is planning and capture him. The Shadowhunters immediately get to work diving into the Clave archives, searching for clues to the Magister's past. Unfortunately, it is not just his secrets that are exposed as the loyalties of the institute members are also revealed. That sounds fairly interesting, right? So what's my issue? Why couldn't I love this book? Well, if I put it bluntly: It was boring. The beginning took way to long to pick up and if I had to guess, I'd say nothing exciting happens until around page 250. Um, I don't know about you, but that is way too long to keep me hanging. It took me 15 days to read this book. 15 days. At one point I just had to put it down for a few days and read something else because every time I picked up the book it would put me in this kind of mood: Sure the Shadowhunters did things, but every time they were about to go on a mission we are given unnecessary descriptions of what Tessa is going to wear or how Sophie did her hair or how silver Jem's eyes looked that day. Who cares? The suspense leading up to the mission died while Tessa was taking her sweet ass time getting dressed. Speaking of Tessa, she is a pathetic heroine. She is good for one thing only: changing her appearance. She's not a fighter and despite her being trained in this book, she was virtually worthless. Yet, they always had to take her along on missions. When they actually used her power she manages to screw it up. They attend a \"bad guy's party\" (Just go with it. I don't want to spoil it for you.) and Tessa screws up her disguise because she drinks some type of spiked warlock lemonade. Yeah. I don't know about you, but when I'm crashing a bad guy's party, I never drink the punch. So she's walking around as herself and none of the evil dudes seem to notice or care. HUH? But she's an idiot, so I don't expect much from her. However, Will drinks it too. At that point I'm thinking, \"You've been a Shadowhunter for how long exactly?\" That scene made no sense. Even though the book was boring, that's not even my biggest issue with it. While I was reading I always felt disconnected to the characters. The only character I did care about was Jem and that's probably because he's the only one who didn't seem like a direct rip-off from the Mortal Instruments series. I felt flashes of these characters in Clockwork Angel , but now I'm fully convinced that Draco/Harry Will is Jace, Hermione/Ginny Tessa is Clary, ect. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice--Nope. I see what you did there. Will Jace . I hate this guy. He reminds me of the Jace in City of Fallen Angels. \"I can't be with you because it will kill you! So I'm going to act like the shitiest person on earth so you will hate me!\" Sound familiar anyone? Seriously, there are only so many times you can recycle a plot twist before you become predictable. I'm not sure you can even call it a plot twist anymore. So not only is he a carbon copy of Jace, but he goes through the same tortured character issue too? No, I'm not buying that. He was the reason why I almost didn't finish the book. He's such a prick and Tessa knows it, but she still loves him \"because there is just something about him!\" *eyeroll* Yes, I'm well aware of the curse, but that entire situation never seemed real to me anyway. (view spoiler) [It was so obvious that the curse was a fake. \"Everyone who loves you will die! Muahahaha!\" What kind of lame curse is that? And why did Will think no one loved him? Charlotte's love for him was just pouring off the pages. He didn't think it odd that she was still alive? Does anyone besides Jem use their brain in this series? (hide spoiler) ] So when I finally get to the \"good part,\" some things happen that are supposed to shock me, I guess. There is this big revelation made right before the fight scene. (view spoiler) [We find out Nate and Tessa aren't brother and sister. (hide spoiler) ] WAIT. Didn't you use that revelation is City of Glass, Clare?? Please stop putting you plot twists through the laundry wash cycle. It doesn't make them new again. *sigh* After the fight scene, there is still a good 75 pages left and I was hoping for more action. But, of course, there is none. Most of it is filled with more relationship drama that surprisingly made me happy. However, it will most likely piss off fans of the series. LOL. (view spoiler) [That's right, Will! You are shit outta luck! (hide spoiler) ] There is a cliffhanger at the end of the book, but by that time I was so through with it all, that it didn't move me one bit. The writing was difficult for me, but I've never really jived well with Clare's style. Death to those bloody commas! My eyes are waving little white surrender flags! O_o Another thing I found strange was that Tessa is supposed to be American (right?), but it seemed like she still sounded English. In other words, all of the characters spoke very similarly. There was only one time when Tessa used an American slang term and it felt odd and out of place. And how many times must the word 'quite' be used? \"Oh, you are quite right!\" \"This is quite uncomfortable.\" \"I don't think you quite understand.\" I'm pretty sure 'quite' is used every few pages and it's annoying. The characters are trying so hard to sound English. It just didn't work for me. Will I read Clockwork Princess? I don't know, maybe. The only reason I'm remotely curious is because I want to see what's going to happen to Jem. I like that guy. Yeah, I know. The volcanoes in hell are freezing over because I actually really like one of Clare's characters. Amazing. Oh, and before I forget: (view spoiler) [Did anyone else notice anything familiar with how the Shadowhunters vote? Um, Goblet of Fire anyone?

Don't forget to read the scene from Jem's POV here http://www.cassandraclare.com/my-writ... We finally learn Will's big secret. Although it wasn't that big of a reveal for me. I was honestly hoping for something a little more dramatic. I felt a little bad for Will but then again I didn't. He had FIVE YEARS to look into it. Yes he was young when it first happened but he could of talked to Jem about it or looked into it himself. I was highly disappointed with this plot line. I enjoyed Sophie getting more of a story and a love interest. I also loved getting to know Charlotte and Henry more and seeing them support each other. Gideon and Gabriel were interesting and I loved the bickering between them and the other characters. While I am looking forward to Clockwork Princess, I fear heartbreak.

Alright, that's actually a lie (just one, okay?), but I rarely come across any books with a good love triangle. I mean, take Twilight, for example. Who thought that she would actually end up with Jacob? Even Jacob's fangirls knew that Bella wouldn't choose Jacob. By the way... lord, I wouldn't want to kiss Taylor, despite his hotness. Look at the way he puckers his lips. Is he constipated? The homeless man sleeping under the bridge knew Bella would end up with Edward! It was no surprise - it was a useless, angsty, infuriating shape (get it? get it? a love 'triangle'?) to put in that book. Wait, holy crap, does he have abs?! Now, I think that Clockwork Prince owns the damn thing . . . because you don't know who Tessa will end up with. Sure - most of us believe it'll be Will, because he was Tessa's first flame, he 'understands her', he's the badboy, and, like . . . stuff . . . But, my dilemma? I want both Jem and Will to end up with Tessa \u2013 more so, Jem, I admit. But anyone would know Tessa can\u2019t have them both. Too bad. Actually, just have threesome! Problem solved. Why doesn't anyone think of that? Kid Cudi did. I love Will. Really, I do. He\u2019s hilarious, and cruel, and a jerk. He loves to read, and he loves poetry, and he's actually very thoughtful and wise. He grew up to fast, and yes - he's horrible to Tessa sometimes. But he has his reasons , and he'd gladly give up his life for her . . . Like Jem. Jem stole my heart from the first time, and he hasn\u2019t given it back just yet. I am completely and utterly in love with Jem. Seriously. Just stalk my reviews and comments and stuff, and you'll see that 99% of them are about Jem and my intense, burning love and passion for him, along with various, various other literary boyfriends. But Jem is #1 on my list. Both are in love with Tessa, and I just want Jem to be happy. Characters Clare manages to make amazing, funny, and heartfelt characters in her stories. Tessa. The girl was okay enough. I honestly remain baffled at how she attracted the attention of the two most amazing guys in the universe, but I love how she has a smartass response to Will's douchy comments. Jem is quiet, insanely kind, totally polite, and just plain AMAZING. There are no words to describe how loving this guy is. He'd never say a harmful word to anyone (unless he really needs to), and he's just ugh so bloody hot. Thank you for ruining my chances of ever having a boyfriend, Ms. Clare. You must be so proud. Will is hysterical and swoon-worthy. You know how a lot of YA authors (read: ALL) claim the new guy is \u201chot and mysterious\u201d? Yeah, well, darlings, I\u2019ve only known two guys in YA books that are that deserve to be called \u201chot and mysterious\u201d. That\u2019s Will and Ash. The more minor characters are mostly are intriguing, and I liked most of them well enough. But, wait, there's Magnus. MagnusMagnusMagnus, my love. I could read a whole book about this witty, hot, uproarious warlock. Writing I'm rather 'meh' about Clare's writing - I like it, I really do, but it's just so purple and metaphor-filled. You could slim down half the book if you just cut out all the similes in that brick. Such writing makes the story hard to follow and rather confusing. I cracked up several times during Clockwork Prince, and this is why: \u201cDid you just kiss me?\" Will inquired. Magnus made a slip-second decision. \"No.\" \"I thought-\" \"On occasion the aftereffects of the painkilling spells can result in hallucinations of the most bizarre sort.\" \"Oh,\" Will said. \"How peculiar.\u201d \u201cPatriotic?\u201d Will looked smug. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s patriotic,\u201d he said. \u201cIn honor of my birthplace, I\u2019ve the dragon of Wales tattooed on my\u2014\u201d One Last Thing . . . Dear Ms. Clare, Please don't kill of Jem, or many us us Jem lovers are going to die as well. There will be an outbreak of teen deaths (bitch please, we died of a cracked heart) around the world if he does die, or if Tessa dumps his poor sexy ass. Actually, it would be better if he stays with Tessa. Because it's time the good guy gets the girl. It's always the first guy who meets the girl who ends up with her . . . can you break the cycle? Give him a chance? We don't want Jem to end up with some random female character, or dead. We just want him and Will happy. Also, if you do hurt Jem, sorry, but . . . We'll cut you. Obviously we're just kidding, but seriously. Don't. I highly recommend THE INFERNAL DEVICES. In my opinion it is a million times better than THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS.

I was worried that Clockwork Prince wouldn't live up to the greatness that Clockwork Angel was but it turned out to be just as great, or even better than the first book. This series really never fails to amaze me! I can't even begin to count how many times my heart broke and put itself back together again while reading Clockwork Prince. Especially for Will. Poor, William Herondale. All those wasted years, and what it's caused... SMH. And Jessamine too! Even though I have a love/hate relationship with Jessie, I can't help but feel bad for her despite her actions. She may be ungrateful and a sorry excuse of a Shadowhunter, but deep down she's still just a young girl just like Tessa, that yearns for love and a family. I really hope Jessamine redeems herself in Clockwork Princess and finally puts those Shadowhunter abilities to good use like she was born to do. As for the love triangle, I am still firmly a Wessa shipper. I appreciate the development between Jem and Tessa, but it's definitely not the same as Will and Tessa's relationship. Will and Tessa's interactions, although scarce, still had more meaning to it than that of Jem and Tessa's moments. Maybe that's just my Wessa heart talking but that's just my opinion on that matter. Jem and Tessa's relationship is sweet, but I feel like Tessa is only settling for Jem in order to forget about Will. Still, I was a little underwhelmed with the lack of Will and Tessa compared to the first book but I'm hoping now with Will's curse out of the way, we'll be seeing a lot of a Wessa in Clockwork Princess. Pretty please, Cassandra Clare! I still honestly do believe that Will and Tessa are endgame even after the ending of this book. With Jem's condition... I feel like I already know what's coming in Clockwork Princess. It just sounds inevitable so I'm preparing myself for when/if that time comes because although I'm team Wessa, my Will and Jem bromance shipping heart will break. Especially for Will, if it does happen, because... Parabatai. :'( BUT, I'm still hoping for the best and that everyone will get their happily ever after in Clockwork Princess. I can't wait to start off the new year to the final conclusion to The Infernal Devices! ...more Compelling plot-line: \u2713 Superfluous mention of characters' eye colors: \u2713 Demon pox: \u2713 Romantic relationships galore: \u2713 Character development: \u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713 Five hundred pages in which very little occurs other than (say it with me) the love triangle.

Not one thing, unless you believe that the book isn't about the actual automaton army or the evil plot of its creator and is, in fact, only supposed to be about the triangle, in which case, you will be very happy. Enjoy. And I am so exhausted with reading about how good, kind, thoughtful, cheerful, wonderful, perfect, and DELICATE is Gem, I mean Jem. (Clever use of naming there, except NOT) I was so angry with Tessa at the end of this book. I was so angry that she didn't even take a day to think things over (view spoiler) [ and the idea that you would marry someone to make them happy even if it breaks your own heart is plainly stupid, not to mention that we've been down a similar road before with Jace and Clary. Also, what about Will's heart? Who cares if his is broken because Gem, I mean Jem, is so perfect and delicate that he mustn't be upset. Really? They had been engaged at that time for what, a few hours? Who does Tessa think she is? Does she think Jem would want to marry her if he knew he wasn't the first choice? Puh-leez (hide spoiler) ] Honestly, Ms. Clare, please think up something else for tension in your books. Please. Most of the book is everyone sitting around the dining table or in the drawing room or various bedrooms(Tessa) and talking, plotting what they will do, where they will go, etc. And most of the action seems only to be situations in which Tessa can be alone with either of her boys or both. They travel to Yorkshire, both boys. They search out Will in Whitechapel, Jem (and then a cuddle up with Will). A fancy ball at Lightwood's estate, Will. Visiting Jessamine, Jem Visiting Lightwood, Will. And that is pretty much all that actually happens. I've said this before about other books, but I do think it bears repeating. If Tessa was a guy messing this way with two hot girls, would readers think it is perfectly fine? I really don't think they would. And, honestly Tessa's behavior isn't okay. It. Just. Is. Not. (I don't mean that in the Victorian sense, but almost having sex with this boy one night and the next night being all over the other one, it is questionable behavior, to say the least.) (view spoiler) [And either the characters are liars or the book needed some editing because Tessa says she must marry Jem because he told her he \"thought he would die without ever loving anyone as his father loved his mother, without ever being loved in return.\" He never said that in any way, shape or form. I read over that scene several times to see where I might have missed it and those words or that inference simply isn't there. Never said it. Jem also says he is getting better and getting stronger and Will and Tessa seem to believe this even thought Jem is lying, knowingly lying because his symptoms have worsened. Are we as readers not supposed to know this? It's either lying or poor editing, not sure which. And I keep thinking of one more thing. Tessa's balcony snogging with Will is thought to be the result of demon-spiked drink. Okay, if you want to tell yourself that, Tessa, you air-headed, addle-pated twit, then go right ahead. But let's take a little peek at your other indiscretion, shall we? You almost got naked with Jem and could taste the drugs on his lips , etc. So maybe you were also under the influence of drugs there. Ever stop to think about that one? (hide spoiler) ] One final very last thing, I promise this is my really last addition, but it's a biggie. Will and Jem are parabatai , closer than brothers, finish each other's sentences, no that's wrong, they actually finish each other's thoughts. All of that, they are so close, they are each other's rock, each other's steadfast friend when they have no friends left. And neither one of them, not at all, not even a tiny little teeny weeny hint, neither one has any idea that the other one is in love with the girl he loves. I find that impossible to believe. Neither one would notice that the other acts differently around this girl. Neither one would say, \"hey, dude\" what's up with that?\" Yeah, I know, these are Victorian Shadowhunters who would not say hey dude, but seriously, they would be aware of the other, wouldn't they? Seriously, wouldn't they? I know gentlemen of this time were very circumspect in their conversation and all that, but come the heck on. Even Fitzwilliam Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, the paragon of manners and proper behavior(hey, if Clare can use those references then so can I) discusses matters of the heart with his friend, Bingley so you can't say that men don't do that. I will finish off this series. There had best be only one more book as planned. Unfortunately, there is nothing original here and unless Clare can come up with a new plot that isn't merely romantic angst for no real reason masquerading as whatever this is supposed to be, I will think more than twice about starting any new series she might write.

[image error] See? Smooooooooth. Like I said I'm totally in the minority with this book (the average is 4.58 stars for Pete's sakes) and even people who love Will like I do still rated it five stars, so why the hell, exactly, didn't I also rate this book five stars? Honestly, didn't think that I liked Will enough to be that devastated by what Clare does in this book, but I was. And it affected how I viewed the whole rest of the book. The haze of sadness that I was in after I figured out what Clare was doing/did made me skim though the rest of the book while I cried to myself about the tragedy that is Will Herondale. Sigh. I'll just come right out and say it: I hated the last twenty-five percent of that book. Hatedithatedithatedit! *breathes in and out deeply* Don't get me wrong I do like Jem, but after I finished reading it this is al I wanted to say to him: [image error] See? I said it with a smile so I'm still calm. Jem really is a great character and I love him a lot, but just not as Tessa's \"main squeeze.\" Basically the last twenty-five percent of the book seemed to be all about building Will up just to crush him into unidentifiable little pieces, and that really bothered me. Not only did I find the whole drama between Will, Jem, and Tessa really kind of unnecessary because it seems to me and many other people that Tessa is still somehow going to be with Will, and now this really forces Clare to kill off either Jem or Will in the next book ( as my friend in the comment section of this book quite rightly said, \"I want to see some legit pain, you know? She's gotta top the heartache of this book. I don't know how, but she has to unless she wants the entire climax to be lame and anti-climactic.\") but Clockwork Princess won't be published for almost two fucking years. I mean what the hell, Clare?! I know that there is going to be the next book of her other series in-between these two, but I honestly like the Infernal Devices series a lot more than Mortal Instruments, and having her have us wait so long for this book just really bothers me. I know it builds up excitement and all that shit stuff, but for me I just find it to be, like I said, bothersome. I just want to know what happens, dammit! Clare's really got me wrapped around her little finger, doesn't she? Damn her....... Really, the rest of this book is great, for the most part. The humor from my darling Will is just as good as ever, and even though there wasn't as much action and/or suspense that I would've liked I have a feeling that Clockwork Princess will be filled to the brim with it, so I'm willing to settle. The only thing about this book that I really didn't enjoy was how Clare handled of the mystery of Tessa's birth and who her father is. We get a couple of really vague ideas about who she is and some other random facts, but for how important and a driving force it was for this book and the other book, I feel like we should have found out more about her past than what we get. Overall, though, this is a great book, unless you're like me and totally can't get past the devastating horribleness that is the tragicalosity (yes I just made up that word, and I'm totally awesome) that is my sexy little Willy-bear. I'll just be in my bed, crying about Will, until the next book comes out.

Characters with personalities and quirks and preferences and histories, characters that are never stereotypes or caricatures or tokens.

And \u2013 if it\u2019s not the last book of a series \u2013 an ending that will leave you with bald spots from where you ripped out your own hair in agony. I\u2019ve made no bones (or cities thereof\u2026haha, I\u2019m so punny) about the fact that I am a HUGE Cassandra Clare fan. She\u2019s my absolute favorite author, and I\u2019ve loved every single one of her books fiercely. I think all of her writing is genius, but she\u2019s completely outdone herself with CLOCKWORK PRINCE. All of those things I mentioned that readers have come to expect from her work were not only present in CP, they were even *more* refined than in her previous work. I wouldn\u2019t have thought it possible, but she\u2019s growing in her craft. CLOCKWORK PRINCE is ~ to date ~ my favorite book of all time! If you\u2019ve read CLOCKWORK ANGEL (and if you haven\u2019t then get thee to the bookstore!) then surely you\u2019ve guessed that CLOCKWORK PRINCE deals in part with the developing love triangle between Will, Tessa, and Jem. Now, I\u2019ve always been a sucker for good romantic angst. The twisted and broken love story between Jace and Clary in Clare\u2019s Mortal Instruments series was just about the most delicious heartfail I\u2019d ever tasted. But if you\u2019ve read many love triangles, then you know that they usually involve some suspension of disbelief. \u201cWhy do these boys just keep falling in love with this girl?\u201d Usually, that answer is quite simple. Usually the answer is merely \u201cbecause she is the protagonist.\u201d Not so in PRINCE. The Tessa Gray we met and grew to know in CLOCKWORK ANGEL is one of the strongest, most endearing female characters I\u2019d ever read. The depths of her personality that are explored in PRINCE elevated her from \u201cone of the most\u201d to \u201cthe most.\u201d She\u2019s strong and independent without being foolish or prideful enough to refuse help when she needs it. Her capacity for love, trust, and forgiveness is inspiring given all that has happened to her by the end of book one, but she is not so careless that she doesn\u2019t protect her heart. She\u2019s smart and funny and kind, but she isn\u2019t perfect. She maintains her humanity (despite her am I a warlock? Am I NOT a warlock? status) and thus her capacity to make mistakes, and to *learn* from her mistakes. She\u2019s the type of character we don\u2019t see often enough in YA literature, the type of role model that is so often lacking in the sea of female protags so spineless and featureless that we can superimpose our own traits onto them. When you view Tessa set up next to Will and Jem as we knew them in ANGEL, and even more so as we get to know them more in PRINCE \u2013 their personalities, their histories, their motivations and the relationships they\u2019ve formed (or not formed) in the past\u2014the question ceases to be the usual \u201cwhy do these boys keep falling in love with her?\u201d The question is clearly \u201cHow could they not?\u201d I\u2019m not going to go into any kind of plot synopsis here, there\u2019s really nothing specific I can say without giving away some of the surprises that make the reading so delectable. But I will say that right from the very first page I was completely engaged in the story. I squealed in delight and cried tears of sadness AND of joy, and at one point shouted \u201cShe did NOT! She did NOT. HOLY CRAP SHE DID!!\u201d aloud. I enjoyed reading CLOCKWORK PRINCE more than I\u2019ve ever enjoyed reading any other book. Ever. Whatever you\u2019re hoping for in this book, your expectations WILL be surpassed. Clare will lead you in a direction to where you\u2019re sure you know what\u2019s about to happen, then throw a curve so fast and hard that you\u2019re left shaking your head and holding your breath. This book is so beautifully constructed that it will make it exceedingly difficult for you to choose a follow up book to read, because the vast majority of what\u2019s out there is a flickering candle against the blazing witchlight of Cassandra Clare\u2019s latest masterpiece. One of the characters says \u201cIt was books that made me feel I was not completely alone. They could be honest with me, and I with them.\u201d That is, at the heart of it, the type of book CLOCKWORK PRINCE is. It\u2019s a book whose story\u2014though filled with the fantastically impossible \u2013 is a book that offers a true and honest story to anyone who visits its pages. A book that demands our own honesty in return. It is a book that does exactly what the very best books are supposed to do. It makes you *feel.* First read ARC Sept 9, 2011.

There's just a lot of filler. It felt like not too much happened in this book, but I JUST LOVE JEM SO MUCH. But oh my goodness I cannot stand the way this particular love triangle is being carried out right now. I took off a full star just out of sheer annoyance at that. It was ok and emotional at first, but when Tessa kept stringing these guys along and kissing the other one every other scene I started to get super exasperated. If she would actually take action instead of letting everything happen to her, I'd like her more. So it was kind of slow overall, but I do love Jem and Will and Sophie!

He is trying to gain control over the Institute by getting one of the shadowhunter's to side with him and try to take Charlotte out of the game.

I'm not saying who the evil shadowhunter is but he is older and he has kids and he eventually gets his, so there! I don't know if I even mentioned in my first review that James Carstairs (Jem) and the love of my clockwork life, has been slowly dying since he was a little boy. But they have a way to keep him from dying too quickly and I hope to hell they find a cure in the last book or I will throw things. Yes. And there is this little love triangle going on with Tessa, Will and Jem. I hate it. There are reasons for it, but I don't want to give too much information out about that. Tessa fell in love with Will first and he pushed her away because of this secret that I can't tell you. She then goes over to Jem's side because he is awesome and she realizes she loves him too. Anyway, things happen in that area and I'm telling you right now if she hurts Jem I'm going to crawl into the book and beat her arse! Moving on.... I also love Magnus Bane in the book. I loved him when I read some of the Mortal Instruments books that I have to go back and read all of now. He's a warlock and he's bad to the bone and funny and actually nice. --->EXCERPT<--- Will shook his head. \"I don't know, Magnus,\" he said. \"He doesn't look like the right one to me.\" \"You said he was blue. This one's blue.\" \"He is blue,\" Will acknowledged, stepping closer to the circle of flame. \"But the demon I need--well, he was really a cobalt blue. This one's more . . . periwinkle.\" \"What did you call me?\" The demon roared with rage. \"Come closer, little Shadowhunter, and let me feast upon your liver! I will tear it from your body while you scream.\" Will turned to Magnus. \"He doesn't sound right either. The voice is different. And the number of eyes.\" So some other shadowhunters come over to show Sophie (who is a servant that we love) and Tessa how to fight. It's part of some deal that the brothers, Gabriel and Gideon have to do. But we like Gideon, he's a good guy and does the right thing. There are a few more people brought into the house, they find a spy among them, more creepy automatons, some fight outs, drugs, craziness, and revelations galore. Oh and that ending!!!

I was so incredibly happy for Jem :) (hide spoiler) ] Actually I enjoy almost all characters in those books (except Mortmain and Nate and the Dark Sisters probably) (duh.) ...more \u201cWo ai ni, Tessa.\" he whispered. \"Wo bu xiang shi qu ni.\" As far as I can remember, I haven't swoon over any characters for a very long time. But for Clockwork Prince, I yielded, for James who brought the deepest part of me out, wrapped it and made it warm. The main plot isn't that interesting, but the love triangle between Will, Tessa and James is remarkable and flowery. How could CC creat such a beautiful relationship without me rolling my eyes ? idk.

And this book is worth everything I had to put up with the previous one. \u201cThey say time heals all wounds, but that presumes the source of the grief is finite\u201d I was wrecked after finishing this book. This is an emotional roller coaster ride indeed. Something happened in this book, and that pushed me to read and read and read until my eyes hurt. Even now I think TID is a little bit better than TMI series with Will, Tessa and James in it. Actually I don't care much who Tessa will settle down with. Darn it ! It's engaging and promising. I couldn't pick Clockwork Princess up fast enough. \u201cTess, Tess, Tessa. Was there ever a more beautiful sound than your name? To speak it aloud makes my heart ring like a bell. Strange to imagine that, isn\u2019t it \u2013 a heart ringing \u2013 but when you touch me that is what it is like: as if my heart is ringing in my chest and the sound shivers down my veins and splinters my bones with joy. Why have I written these words in this book? Because of you. You taught me to love this book where I had scorned it. When I read it for the second time, with an open mind and heart, I felt the most complete despair and envy of Sydney Carton. Yes, Sydney, for even if he had no hope that the woman he loved would love him, at least he could tell her of his love. At least he could do something to prove his passion, even if that thing was to die. I would have chosen death for a chance to tell you the truth, Tessa, if I could have been assured that death would be my own. And that is why I envied Sydney, for he was free. And now at last I am free, and I can finally tell you, without fear of danger to you, all that I feel in my heart. You are not the last dream of my soul. You are the first dream, the only dream I ever was unable to stop myself from dreaming. You are the first dream of my soul, and from that dream I hope will come all other dreams, a lifetime\u2019s worth.

Tessa continues to struggle with her identity, because as no one knows what she is, she doesn't quote know who that makes her. Tessa must learn to define herself despite these things. She must also choose between her brother and the Shadowhunters.

(hide spoiler) ] Also, many people have said that this series is just a rehashing of her other one, The Mortal Instruments. It's been many years since I've read them, so it's really not like that to me. But even if it was, I honestly don't care because I read these books for the characters. These books are very character driven and I care about these guys more than the ones in TMI (sorry, it's the harsh truth). So if you don't care about technicalities and you like character development, these are the books for you. ***note, I didn't cast Will because I still can't find what I picture him like, maybe someday but like all dream men, I'm beginning to believe he doesn't exist :(( *** 2nd note, this was me and Feifei while I was reading: [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more A problem I didn't note in my Clockwork Angel review, but was made rather clear by reading Clockwork Prince , was that the characters do not feel Victorian in the least. They feel like the smirking, hip teenage demon hunters of Clare's The Mortal Instruments . There's just far too much sarcasm used. Oscar Wilde was indeed known for his dry wit, but it wasn't really common for Victorians to be outwardly sarcastic with each other. They did things with style and subtlety. Even if my history of Victor A problem I didn't note in my Clockwork Angel review, but was made rather clear by reading Clockwork Prince , was that the characters do not feel Victorian in the least.

Oscar Wilde was indeed known for his dry wit, but it wasn't really common for Victorians to be outwardly sarcastic with each other. They did things with style and subtlety. Even if my history of Victorian parlance isn't entirely accurate here, I'm pretty damn sure that Victorian gentlemen wouldn't roll their eyes at the cook and go: \u201cOh God, you're Irish, can you make anything without potatoes?\u201d Another problem with this book was how utterly boring it was. I'm talking fall asleep whilst skim reading boring. The twists weren't clever, the subplots weren't interesting, and sometimes, characters go somewhere, discover something, and then... drop it for a bit. The revelation about Will's character didn't make me feel anything for him other than imagining some wangsty Victorian fellow trying to come across as a broody heartthrob, and falling flat on his skinny little derriere. And you know, there's a final volume of this that's going to be released this year. Then Clare is free to work all she wants on Lady Midnight , the first volume in her new series. Set in the future. Which focuses on a girl brought into the world of the Shadowhunters and the two boys who she has to decide between. Oh joy. If Clare likes playing literary flavour of the month with her books, then let's just say that The Mortal Instruments was probably the well-worn, dark and musty yet spine-tingling flavour of the supernatural. Her Infernal Devices series has the rich, heady, and acrid, smoggy flavour of Victorian steampunk. And the pinch of spice that I bet will flavour this futuristic retelling of Clary, Jace and Alec/Tessa, Jem and Will, will be the bland, government-sanctioned taste of dystopia fresh off the trend from The Hunger Games . Blergh. 1.5/5.

Edited@14/01/2014: Have anyone taken a good look at the cover of Clockwork Prince? Supposedly it's Jem on the cover (though this model looks nothing like Jem, for crying out loud) but then one day I noticed on this cover, Jem is holding a dragon-head cane. Now we have a problem. It's time for Chinese History 101: In the imperial China, only the Emperor and the members of the royal family could wear clothes with dragons on them, or possessed personal items with dragon ornaments on them. If a commoner was found wearing/possessing dragon ornaments, the punishment for such offence was death. So tell me, how come a cane with a dragon head on it can come into Jem's possession? Here's the link to something I wrote concerning the topic of Cassandra Clare and plagiarism. Note: I posted this photo up here before I can lay my hands on this book because I know I'll need it once I start reading... Now, the actual review starts here: I really, really didn't expect it, but after finishing Clockwork Prince (CP), I found Cassandra Clare actually hit the rock bottom with this second book of The Infernal Devices series. If you thought Clockwork Angel is bad, wait till you read CP! Why would I say that? Here're a few points: (1) The horrible love Triangle Don't get me wrong, I like reading about people falling in love, I can even tolerate love triangles when they're well written . But I hate whatever romance Cassandra Clare has to offer with a passion. At first I couldn't quite pinpoint why her romances make my stomach turn so much. But after reading so many woody, uninspiring 'romantic' Will/Tessa and Jem/Tessa scenes throughout CP, I began to realize why Clare's love triangle pisses me off so much... It's because I can't sense any passion in Clare's writing. It's like she was merely writing a very formalized version of what people should do/think/feel when they're in love. There's no heart, no passion, no real feeling beyond her 'romances'!>_< Whenever I read a good, heartfelt romance, I would cheer the couple on and feel happy when they finally get together, but I never do that with any of Clare's couples. Plus, we are supposed to believe Jem and Will were all head over heels for Tessa, but what's so adorable about her? I don't get it. If Tessa was kind and brave, then isn't Sophie just the same!? So why would Will and Jem never notice her as a love interest? Why? Well, the romance might actually have worked out well if only Tessa is a likable character, but sadly she never is; for her creator Clare has always mistaken bitchiness, stupidity and selfishness with bravery and independence when it comes to her female characters. *sighs* (2)Clare's failed attempt to make Will sympathetic Will, he was a major jackass in Clockwork Angel, but starting from Chapter One of Clockwork Prince, Clare intended to let us see the 'different' side of Will's character by throwing off hints that he had feeling for Tessa, throwing off hints that there's a reason for him to be so much of an asshole to everyone, blah blah blah. But dose Clare's attempt to make Will sympathetic work? My answer to that is a big fat NO . (view spoiler) [ Let me get down to Will's curse. Supposedly when Will was 12 years old, he accidentally released a demon, the demon cursed him that every person who looks at him with love will die, unless he removes himself from their presence . This is the condition of the curse. And at the same night he was 'cursed', Will's sister died painfully, causing Will to believe her death was the curse at work, so he escaped from his family without looking back. First there're many holes in this story, for example why would Will's father, an ex-Shadowhunter be allowed to keep a trapped demon? Why would the man be foolish enough to keep said demon under the same roof with his own wife and children? Was the father really that stupid? But what I want to discuss is how idiotically Will had reacted to his 'curse'. After he was 'cursed', Will never mentioned it with any of the adults, not his parents, not Henry and Charlotte, no one. What the hell? Did the demon ever forbid Will to mention his curse to anyone? No? Then why wouldn't he tell the Shadowhunters about his curse? Weren't the Shadowhunters experts of dealing with curses and demons!? Even when the Shadowhunters couldn't handle it, wouldn't there be Silent Brothers around to do the job? Why would Will be such an idiot!? Plus, I don't even want to mention how unlikely it is for the demon to cast a fake curse on Will which couldn't even work out! Wouldn't it be easier for the demon to tear Will and his sister from limb to limb, then wait for their parents to come back if the demon really wants revenge for his imprisonment!? (hide spoiler) ] This one is for all the Will-defenders out there: Please look me in the eyes and explain to me why should I feel any sympathy for someone who said the following line to someone else: \"Lord, you're Irish,\" said Will, \"Can you make things that don't have potatoes in them?\" Will said that to the new cook once he realized she was Irish. What a total racist dickhead he is. He makes me sick. my GR friend Andre joked about \"Will was cursed to a life of assholeness\" and I can't agree more with him. The whole thing about Will and his curse is just pathetic. It's just a bucket of nonsense in my eyes. Just for the record, I think the demons in The Demon's Lexicon Trilogy by Sarah Rees Brennan are 1000% more awesome, evil and frightening than what Clare has to offer (3) The flat, uninteresting characters Tessa: She's not as hateful as she was in CA, but my goodness she's dull and uninteresting. Can't see what Jem and Will see in her. Will: He's an ass. He's an ass who reads through someone else's letters without permission, who had humiliated a girl in the past by reading her diary entries aloud to a whole roomful of guests. Will is a horrible person. The reason why he's parabatai with Jem only highlighted how hateful and selfish he is-- My goodness Will didn't even tell Jem the real reason why he agreed to be parabatai with him all along! WHO NEED ENEMY WHEN THEY HAVE *FRIEND* LIKE THIS!? Plus, the reason why he wants to break his curse is because he doesn't want to hurt Tessa's feeling. Oh, great. So Will doesn't care if he hurt Jem, Henry and Charrlotte's feeling throughout five long years, but he cares about himself hurting Tessa's feeling!? I can't believe how selfish this guy can be and how little he had thought of his best friend and the two adults who had bothered to raise him up! That's hateful! Jem: He's still the nice guy and there's nothing more about him. But how could a half Chinese-half British with bright sliver hair mixed person goes unnoticed in the Victorian London? And he also suffers no race discrimination? It makes no sense. Jessamine: She's only there to be the total bitch so Tessa could look good. Full Stop. Sophie: I don't know why she has her own storyline in this book. She serves no real purpose other than to be one of the Lightwood brothers' love interest. And even that romance with said Lightwood brother could have been done off-screen. Charlotte and Henry: They barely show any maturity and leadership in the book. I hate to say that but Charlotte's behaviors show that she has yet to prove herself a capable leader! I like Charlotte, but still... Nate: A cardboard cutout. I have nothing to say about him. (4) The Shadowhunters' idiocy I had talked about Henry and Charlotte's lack of leadership, but the Shadowhunters as a whole continue to act like they are a bunch of idiots. They are even more lousy than they were in Clockwork Angel. For example, in the mask ball scene, Tessa and Will simply started making out when they should have been busy trying to escape from the villains! That's damn stupid! Worse still, they(mostly Will) seemed to think the bad guys were as stupid as they were! Again for example, (view spoiler) [ Tessa Changed into Jessamine in order to meet Nate in a mask ball, but after her leaving the ball under suspicious condition, the Shadowhunters still thought Nate would fall for the same trick again?!? (hide spoiler) ] Shit, the Shadowhunters still thought it's a good idea for Tessa to play the same trick again? They really thought the bad guys were THAT stupid? Not to mention the mask ball scene doesn't make any sense at all. (view spoiler) [Why would the bad guy meet the spy who he had planted in the enemy camp in a ball , where everyone can see them!? Plus why would the bad Shadowhunter think it's a good idea to host a ball with Downworlders doing illegal activities within his own mansion!? That's just damn stupid! (hide spoiler) ] (5) Where's the villain!? (view spoiler) [The arch villain, Mortmain has been nowhere in sight throughout the entire book, leaving only Nate--who isn't all that bright nor frightening, in his place. My goodness, I had never, never read a second book in which the arch villain is absent. (hide spoiler) ] So what's the point of Clockwork Prince's very existence? Seriously, I think Clare is wasting my time here. (6) The boredom, oh the boredom! There're some 500 pages in CP, but at least 1/3 of them could have been cut off for good. Mostly I want to complain about the screen time which is wasted on the romances. The Will/Tessa and Jem/Tessa scenes are equally woody, boring and pointless. Plus, I don't know why Sophie gets her own storyline when said storyline serves no purpose other than throwing one more romance into a story. (7) The supposed 'Victorian' background I am not an expert of history, but I cannot help but noticing hardly any of the character in TDI act like they are people from the Victorian era. I have problem suppressing my disbelief when Will, Jem, Henry and Charlotte all went \"OH I LOVE YOU! I LOVE YOU! I LOVE YOU!!\" on us. My goodness, I know that during the Victorian era, even husband and wife wouldn't express their feeling so freely. Plus I want to point out at 1870s, Chinese people were very subtle when it comes to expressing romantic love, they were as subtle as the British. But somehow Clae made Jem say \"I love you\" to Tessa in Chinese. Oh my goodness, did she ever know expressions such as \"I love you\" was introduced to China *after* the Republic of China was formed? That \"I love you\" simply isn't part of the common language in the 1870s? I also have problem suppressing my disbelief when Jem made out with Tessa and had his hands up beneath her nightgown. Just... What is that? A Victorian gentleman would never treat a woman like this, not if he respected her. But no, realism has to make way for steaming hot make-out sections, right? I also can't suppress my disbelief when I read that a Shadowhunter asked Sophie \"to see him\" outside of training. I can't believe a Victorian gentleman would do that when in this case Sophie was a maid. Not that there's anything wrong about liking or loving a maid, but I can't believe for a second that any man of Victorian polite society would actually do that. Then I want to point out the issue about Jem's parentage. In the Victorian era, race discrimination was common, and marriages between different races were...rare, especially within the polite society. So why would Jem's parents be faced with no objection when they got married? I don't quite buy this \"Shadowhunters have no race discrimination\" claim---for how would there possibly be no race discrimination against people of colors when the Shadowhunters had such a bad attitude toward Downworlders and they were so against the idea of women being the bosses? Plus unlike J K. Rowling's wizards who didn't have to interact with Muggles directly, the Shadowhunters had to live among humans and moved in the humans' society, so I can't believe the racism at that time could have no influence on the Shadowhunters. Furthermore, my good GR friend Andre also informed me that Opium War took place four years before Jem was born, and you can imagine how the Chinese might feel toward British and half British-half Chinese mixed children at that time. So why would Jem never mentioned having racist problems during his childhood? I also want to point out how unrealistic Tessa's reaction to Jem is. I found it unrealistic for Tessa not having any negative feeling or doubt toward Jem when they first met. She wasn't even being taken aback when she learnt there is a half Chinese among Shadowhunters. It's highly unlikely because...back in the time of 1870s, race discrimination against Chinese were wild-spreading among American general public. During the time of TDI, discrimination against Chinese was widely common, especially among the working class people---who believed their jobs were stolen by the Chinese, and the mainstream media of that time was eager to paint Chinese as evil invaders or scary criminals who had a lot of immoral bad hobbies (e.g. opium smoking, gambling and whoring and even rat-eating etc) which were against the Christian values. The media of that time happily and self righteously fed those stereotypes to the public. That, was how unpopular the Chinese had once been in America, no kidding. And I can't think for a reason for Tessa to be unaware of Chinese and/or mixed blood people's bad reputation of that time. Tessa only acted like \"Oh so Jem is a half-Chinese? Oh, I had never seen a Chinese before!\" That's quite unrealistic. Conclusion: In one of my statuses, my GR friend Ceilidh commented that: \"Oh honey, you really are a literary masochist. First the Tiger's Racist Curse books and now this? \" Okay, I admit that Ceilidh is right, reading C. Clare's books really makes me a literary masochist. Because for what reason else would I be reading Clockwork Prince, when the author (1) has became very very lazy, (2) had done poor research on the historical London, (3) hasn't taken her creations and her readers seriously, (4) has been giving us increasingly shitty plots and characters, (5) didn't even TRY to make her story and characters make sense. I'm serious, after reading seven of Clare's novels, I don't think this woman respects her readers, nor her own stories.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more Team Will?

It was not just a filler book, it strengthened the foundation that was set up in the first and further explored various aspects of the series that continues to make it a superbly riveting read. Beautifully done against a rich Victorian era setting, I devoured every single detail of it and almost every scene is essential to this series. The way CC has described the characters' emotions and thoughts was fantastically done, it made me connect to them so easily even from Book 1 itself. It didn't come as easily for me in her Mortal Instrument series, but here is flowed effortlessly. I'm just constantly flooded with all these strong emotions for Will, Tessa and Jem. My heart broke for Will over and over again as we finally got to see what kept him at bay. Jem, such a sweet loving guy and for what he's going through, my heart equally goes out to him. And brave Tessa, I admire her constant resilience and am gutted by the conflicts she deal with for she equally love both guys who love her back. \u201cI could not tell you if I loved you the first moment I saw you, or if it was the second or third or fourth. But I remember the first moment I looked at you walking toward me and realized that somehow the rest of the world seemed to vanish when I was with you.\u201d I'm not usually a fan of a love triangle story because usually I get so pissed at them/the heroine for their stupidity of actions & creating unnecessary angst. But with this one, the love triangle aspect is so well constructed that leaves your heart equally aching and swelling with love for all three of them. I don't even want to pick a side because you simply cannot. Picking either one will leave an equal devastating effect. At this point, I am overwhelmed with emotions and I'm terrified how this will all end up in the final one because I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS WILL POSSIBLY END WELL! There is simply no predictability or clear foresight of who Tessa ends up with and this- this just scares me shitless. \u201cYou speak of sacrifice, but it is not my sacrifice I offer. It is yours I ask of you.\" Now excuse me while I prepare myself for the wreckage that is my heart when I finish the last book. Thanks Rachel and Feifei for listening to me vent my feels! \u2764\ufe0f I'm gonna need huge emotional support for the last one :( ...more Clockwork Prince by Cassandra Clare holy moly, I'm done, omg that only took me 5 months Both Clockwork Angel and Clockwork Prince took me 5 months each to read, that's not weird and annoying at all... hahaha, only because I kept picking them up and putting them down again I really enjoyed this book, and towards the end, completely felt and fell in-love with the characters, the whole Jem/Tessa/Will thing, I now completely understand... can Tessa just have both please?
