I bought this first volume of Dylan\u2019s Chronicles the day it came out in 2004, was anticipating the hell out of it. Back then I was managing a used record store in College Park, Maryland. I studied poetry and creative writing at UMD, big waste of my time, could\u2019ve learned all that on my own, learn more now on my own than I did then anyway, except from maybe two or three professors who had something to say, and besides reading a lot of Shakespeare, it was a big snooze. Though I did find Frank O\u2019Hara and John Ashberry and Fernando Pessoa and I feel like I learned a great deal about ol\u2019 Will\u2019s plays I wouldn\u2019t have come to on my own. Other than that, I should have studied languages or education or linguistics or history or something that could have landed me a better job after I graduated. When I did graduate, the world was so opaque to me I didn\u2019t know how to take the next step. The reality that I considered the adult, professional world to be seemed so dead and vacant to me that I wanted no part of it, but I knew that my consciousness and my conscience were no longer with the style and opinions of my youth. I had always played music, written songs, shitty as they were, and my circle of friends were mostly wanna-be artists and musicians, some skateboarding punks, pot-heads, some real dim and bright lights. I got a job managing a used record store a few of my friends worked at. That way I didn\u2019t have to move home after graduation, could stay around DC, which I loved (coming from a small town in southern Maryland, the DC/Baltimore duality is almost overwhelmingly fertile, experience-wise, especially if you are young and don\u2019t know other cities). So I started working at this record store that was, in retrospect, at the same time the best and the worst decision I could have made. But it suited me because I knew music inside and out. I knew punk, weirdo-rock, jazz, little no name labels, blues, pop, rap, R & B, African music, Brazilian music, folk singers, composers- I had an infinite catalog of songs always running through my head, felt like I knew millions of lyrics by heart, could name jazz artists by the first four or so bars of a tune, dove deep into every style of music. And I was playing music, writing it myself, so it was an ideal situation, but one I still wanted to keep extremely temporary, employment-wise. My favorite bands came out of the 80\u2019s noise scene, SST bands, stuff like Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr., Spacemen 3, Pelt, bands like Minor Threat and Fugazi, I got into Pavement because they were like nothing I\u2019d ever heard, I dug The Velvet Underground as much as anyone could, \u201cPale Blue Eyes\u201d still makes me weepy, I loved those strange little short-lived mathematical bands like June of 44, A Minor Forest, Hoover. I also loved jazz, all jazz, from Louis Armstrong to the most wild Albert Ayler tunes, Coltrane, Archie Shepp, Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, the European improvisers of harsh noise like Peter Brotzmann, Mats Gustafsson, especially drummers like Hamid Drake, Paal Nilssen-Love, and the masters like Elvin Jones and Buddy Rich, Philly Joe Jones; the great tenor players Sonny Rollins and Lester Young, and those ethereal beings such as Sun Ra, Bobby Hutcherson, Anthony Braxton, who you couldn\u2019t really define or pin down. I came to exalt Django Reinhardt as if he was the real Jesus, the three-fingered Jesus, more striking and more straight to the point than the other Jesus. I had all kinds of music coursing throughout my entire being, pulsing through me all day, all night, I worshiped these people, had shrines to them, treated vinyl records like idols. I played music all day in the store, just put everything on.<---F> Heard so much</---F>. Found so many things I would never have known about unless I had those hours to just explore a vast quantity of random records at my leisure. The only stuff I didn\u2019t really get into was the watered-down stuff, the stuff that sounded too polished, too clean, like pretty college boys made it, or like it cost a million dollars to record. Anything gritty, anything that had something a little off to it, something that didn\u2019t quite sit right, that made you wonder just what the hell was up with this person, I could get into. All genres, all types. The common thread was originality and heart, and something mournful or odd about the tune. It wasn\u2019t until those long, strangely-paced hours of digging through the stock of that record store that I came to know <---A>Bob Dylan</---A>\u2019s music. Dylan had always eluded me, don\u2019t know why, I came to him relatively late in the development of my tastes. I guess it was that I was well-versed in obscurities, but big names of the popular music world seemed instantly repugnant to me; it\u2019s a fault of youth, wanting things to be just for yourself. I just thought that if the masses liked them they couldn\u2019t hold any kind of secret. That the secrets were held by a chosen few, who spoke in tongues, and that those kind of revelations wouldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t reach a mass audience. The weirder the better, it seemed to me, and the more authentic. So when I put on \u201cThe Times They Are A-Changin\u2019\u201d, I just expected it would be another 40 minute write off. Not that I didn\u2019t know Dylan; you can\u2019t grow up in America and not know the name <---C>Bob Dylan</---C>. It\u2019s like not knowing the names Abe Lincoln or Lee Harvey Oswald. But I don\u2019t think I had ever seriously listened to one of his records until now, and in retrospect I think that was the singularly best time for me to hear him, maybe the only time up until then that I was ripe to understand what he was doing, the immensity of what he means, as a songwriter, as a cultural figure, as a presence in the American twentieth century. You can\u2019t be a child or of a child-like mind to get Dylan. You have to have experience, you have to have known some kind of pain and loss and redemption of some sort; like the great blues artists- Charlie Patton, Big Bill Broonzy, Leadbelly- you can\u2019t be kidding around and get what these guys are trying to put across. Dylan hit me like a brick in the face. \u201cWith God On Our Side\u201d and \u201cChimes of Freedom\u201d were the first songs I remember being utterly enraptured with and destroyed by from him: \u201cStarry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe\u201d \u201cTo Ramona\u201d was perhaps the greatest love song I\u2019d ever personally heard: \u201cThe flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes.\u201d... \u201cCorrina, Corrina\u201d, \u201cGirl of the North Country\u201d, etc., the big ones hit me too, \u201cHard Rain A\u2019Fallin\u2019\u201d, \u201cOnly A Pawn in Their Game\u201d. Those first few acoustic records of his seemed like liquid fire, lightning and stone all at once, all of it telling utterly real and bleak truths. And then I moved on through his catalog. \u201cBringing It All Back Home\u201d and the rock-a-billy blues forms, the humor in the lyrics, the takes they kept of Bob laughing at himself, the searing rhythm of the band, \u201cHighway 61 Revisited\u201d which is probably in the top 5 greatest records ever cut, and on through the weirdness of the early seventies, the mid-seventies masterpieces \u201cPlanet Waves\u201d, \u201cBlood on the Tracks\u201d, \u201cDesire\u201d, and then off into the cosmos of the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s when he was throwing all this stuff at the wall to see what would stick, and the eventual renaissance of his late 90\u2019s records and albums from this century, when he really found his form and his tongue again, when you realized he never lost anything but was just out for a long walk... what it was (and this took me a lot of listening to pin down) was that Dylan captured it all, all the influences, all the currents, all the sounds, all the weirdness and nostalgia, the Americana, the high lonesome sound of the mountains as well as the chaos of the city streets, the resonance of the abandoned plains and the reverberation of both ocean coasts, the silence of the hermetic shepherd under the stars and the cockiness of the hard-boiled city kid, the upstart... everything I liked about all the music I had discovered, it all flowed through that great flame of hair, burned in those eyes, seared in that voice and echoed in those plucked strings... I came to say things like \u201cthe Elizabethans had Shakespeare, we have Dylan\u201d and I believe that. Dylan is twentieth century America to me. Somehow it all became amassed in this slight, skinny Jewish kid from the North Country. He seems like the ghost of everyone who ever lived, singing all their laments. So when the first volume of his autobiography came out in 2004 I had my copy set aside at the now long gone but always loved Vertigo Books, and eagerly ran over from the record store to pick it up. But for whatever reason, the first few pages didn\u2019t catch me. I don\u2019t know why. I thought of Dylan as the great artist of our times, of the times preceding mine, of the times to come, and yet, it may have been because of the other reading I was into then (a lot of Joyce, reading and rereading Ulysses), it didn\u2019t grab me. I set it aside. It\u2019s seven years later, I\u2019m working a much better job, just put a record out under my own name, Dylan is still with me as strong as ever, and I\u2019m closing the last page of this remarkable first volume of his memoirs. The book itself is most definitely not only for Dylan aficionados, mostly because so much of what is in the book is Dylan observing the world and times around him, going deep into specifics of memories, fixing time and place by weather, news, architecture, the personalities he encounters, the particularities of the sky and trees, the shadows on streets, the vibe of rooms, the ambience of smoky cramped clubs; basically he writes with an eyes-open style, absorbing the physical world, not self-involved but totally observant. Dylan the man disappears into the spaces he evokes, and then he emerges, startles one with some strange sentence or description, and then the earth is spinning on again, and he is immersed in discourses on folk songs, bars, cities, literature, politics, human nature, history, specifics of music theory, recording techniques, travels; the narrative is utterly non-linear, too; he leaps from memory to memory, associations taking him across decades, and this being the first of what is to be a three volume series, you can see Chronicles becoming this big time, shuffling, always-in-motion mosaic. It\u2019s no surprise that the most literate of song writers loves books so much, and one of the early pleasures in Chronicles is Dylan discovering the books he was to adore, rifling through the libraries of different friends whose couches he happened to be crashing on. Tolstoy, Pushkin, Chekhov, Gogol, Maupassant, Poe, Byron, Shelley, Milton, Ovid; but above all Balzac, Rimbaud, and Baudelaire. (As recently as \u201cLove and Theft\u201d Dylan was still lifting lines like \u201cTime and love has branded me with its claws\u201d, in \u201cPo\u2019 Boy\u201d, straight out of Baudelaire\u2019s \u201cLe Spleen de Paris\u201d). He can\u2019t help but quote Nietzsche and Von Clausewitz and he keeps returning to Kerouac, who he adored as a youth but then came to de-romanticize. Kerouac is to him another emblematic, problematic American figure. He cites Robert Graves\u2019 The White Goddess, and then tells how he eventually met Graves and wanted to ask him all these things about that book, and the poetic muse, but by that time he had forgotten everything about it. Dylan came from Duluth, near where Highway 61, the main thoroughfare of the country-blues, begins, near where the Mississippi River starts, the cold North, steel country, where foghorns blast over Lake Superior, almost mythical territory in itself, and it is in the mythos of America, the mythical Americana of the twentieth century, that Dylan immerses himself, his music, and his recollections- the America of radio plays, general stores, one-room schoolhouses, frost-hewn meadows, coal mines, church bells, patriotic heroes and heroic villains, cowboys and bank robbers and sheriffs and train jumpers, county fairs, Woody Guthrie-esque wandering minstrels above all else, delta blues men and call and response holler sessions- even if you don\u2019t love Dylan, Chronicles is a gigantic, rich, full catalog of all of this kind of lore. One of his song writing techniques in the early Greenwich Village days was to spend hours in the New York Public Library, reading endless newspapers from the 1850\u2019s and 1860\u2019s, picking up random, strange, peculiar stories about the daily life of antebellum Americans. All of that shows in his early songs, and it shows in the particular distance he kept from the movements and currents of his own times- when the entire 60\u2019s youth culture was demanding him to take a stand and be their voice and leader, he could not have felt less in common with them; characters like Stagger Lee and Ulysses S. Grant were more of his peers and contemporaries than the hippies marching on Washington or at Woodstock. His reality was formed by folk songs, which were formed by the lingering smoke of history and personal experience. He was to take those folk forms and blow them all to pieces, make them more than contemporary or futuristic, was to mold something completely new and different from that material, but the American past and American folk stories are the generating point of all he did or has ever done, and the fashions and causes of the times only seem like drops in the great ocean of history he was drawing on. Beyond all of this, Dylan can write prose very well, very interestingly, and in a style that is all his own. If you have heard Theme Time Radio Hour or any recent interview, that is the voice of this book- the blown out, craggy, father-time voice that sounds and talks like it is centuries old, like a petrified forest's would be. The strange rhythms of his speaking voice are not lost in his sentence structure, neither is his ability as a striking wordsmith. On New Orleans: \u201cThe city is a very long poem... Everything in New Orleans is a good idea. Bijou Temple-type cottages and lyric cathedrals side by side. Houses and mansions, structures of wild grace. Italianate, Gothic, Romanesque, Greek Revival standing in a long line in the rain. Roman Catholic art. Sweeping front porches, turrets, cast-iron balconies, colonnades- thirty-foot columns, gloriously beautiful- double pitched roofs, all the architecture of the whole wide world and it doesn\u2019t move. In New Orleans you could almost see other dimensions. There\u2019s only one day at a time here, then it\u2019s tonight and then tomorrow will be today again.\u201d On Johnny Cash: \u201c...ten thousand years of culture fell from him. He could have been a cave dweller. He sounds like he\u2019s a the edge of a fire, or in the deep snow, or in a ghostly forest...\u201d On Dave Van Ronk: \u201cEvery night I felt like I was sitting at the feet of a timeworn monument... his voice was like rusted shrapnel.\u201d On an 8 second, 8mm film clip of Robert Johnson: \u201cHe\u2019s playing with huge, spider-like hands and they magically move over the strings of his guitar. There\u2019s a harp rack with a harmonica around his neck. He looks nothing like a man of stone, no high-strung temperament. He looks almost child-like, an angelic looking figure, innocent as can be. He\u2019s wearing a white linen jumper, coveralls and an unusual gilded cap like Little Lord Fauntleroy. He looks nothing like a man with the hellhound on his trail. He looks immune to human dread and you stare at the image in disbelief.\u201d I particularly like \u201cstructures of wild grace\u201d and \u201cnothing like a man with the hellhound on his trail\u201d. Chronicles is full of this kind of stuff. If you have any notion of or interest in the history or the music of what is called Americana, of everything us Americans here in the United States are culturally perched upon in the twenty-first century, this first volume of Dylan\u2019s memoirs seems like a proper portal that can lead you to into its great depths; it\u2019s fascinating and I can\u2019t wait for the next volumes. ...more After being on my \u201cto read\u201d shelf for a while, this book jumped up a couple spots when Bob Dylan won the Nobel Prize for literature. He didn\u2019t win the prize because of this autobiography or for his novel, but rather for the lyrics he wrote down and then placed over music. This autobiography is well written and honest, but it is disjointed at times and didn\u2019t tell me much about the things I thought I wanted to know about.

I wanted to know what Dylan was thinking when he wrote songs like \u201cBlowin' in the Wind,\u201d and I wanted to know something about his wife and his children. These seem to be things he doesn\u2019t want to talk about and I should have known he wasn\u2019t going to. He has always held a stance of not discussing his music or his personal life and I have to respect him for that. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t like his music if I knew too much about it, or him, and maybe that is something Bob Dylan knows \u2014 he did just win a Nobel Prize. ...more Conscience impels me to remove one star from my original 5.

I quote from some of these findings on the Expecting Rain website : from a book called Really the Blues (1946) by Mezz Mezzrow and Bernard Wolfe, in which a hipster introduces \"his chick\" to Mezzrow: Baby this that powerful man with that good grass that'll make you tip through the highways and byways like a Maltese kitten. Mezz, this is my new dinner and she's a solid viper. And now, part of Dylan's description of his friend Ray's girl, Chloe Kiel: She was cool as pie, hip from head to toe, a Maltese kitten, a solid viper \u2014 always hit the nail on the head. I don't know how much weed she smoked, but a lot. (Chronicles, p. 102) And later in Really the Blues, a black man was \"sitting there actually talking to a white woman cool as pie.\" Really The Blues, page 241: \"I never tried to make a real business out of the gauge, but the demand for it just sprang up by itself, and even after giving the other guys their cut I always had a couple of hundred bucks come the end of the week. I was able to take care of Bonnie and her kid real good, with some new furniture in the house, plenty of clothes, and everything else they needed. My name was getting around the country like wildfire.\" Chronicles, page 103: \"Maybe someday your name will get around the country like wildfire,\" she'd say. \"If you ever get a couple of hundred bucks, buy me something. Really The Blues, page 245: \"...and empty garbage cans loaded with bricks on the heads of the Irish cops on the beat.\" Chronicles, page 103 - 104: \"I crossed over from Hudson to Spring, passed a garbage can loaded with bricks and stopped into a coffee shop.\" Really The Blues, page 174: \"There was The Big Apple dangling right in front of my nose, shiny red and round and juicy.\" Chronicles, page 104: \"The whole city was dangling in front of my nose.\" Chronicles, page 47: \"The kind of people who come from out of nowhere and go right back into it \u2014 a pistol-packing rabbi, a snaggle-toothed girl with a big crucifix between her breasts - all kinds of characters looking for the inner heat.\" Really The Blues, page 6: \"I found myself running with a literary ex-pug, a pistol-packing rabbi, and a peewee jockey whose onliest riding crop was a stick of marihuana.\" Really The Blues, page 203: \"These two fly chicks got up on their high-horse when we quizzed them about it - one insisted she was pure Spanish, and sported a crucifix right over her breastworks to prove it...\" Really The Blues, page 210: \"He had razor legs, snaggle teeth and dribble lips...\" Chronicles, page 47: \"A frantic atmosphere - all kinds of characters talking fast, moving fast - some debonair, some rakish.\" Really The Blues, page 212: \"...a light gray felt for me with the brim turned down on one side, kind of debonair and rakish.\" Chronicles, page 47: \"Some people even had titles - 'The Man Who Made History,' 'The Link Between The Races\" - that's how they'd want to be referred to.\" Really The Blues, page 210: \"On The Corner I was to become known as the Reefer King, the Link Between the Races, The Philosopher, the Mezz, Poppa Mezz, Pop's Boy, the White Mayor of Harlem, the Man about Town, the Man that Hipped the World, the Man that Made History, the Man with the Righteous Bush, He Who Diggeth the Digger, Father Neptune.\" From Chronicles page 4: \"Outside the wind was blowing, straggling cloud wisps, snow whirling in the red lanterned streets...\" From The Return of Dr. Fu-Manchu (1916) by Sax Rohmer: \"The moon sailed clear of the straggling cloud wisps which alone told of the recent storm...\" From Chronicles page 95, regarding Monk: \"Even then, he summoned magic shadows into being.\" From The Return of Dr. Fu-Manchu (1916) by Sax Rohmer: \"To-night the moon was come, raising her Aladdin's lamp up to the star world and summoning magic shadows into being.\" Ed Cook had noted a passage in Chronicles that comes from a different Sax Rohmer novel: Sax Rohmer, Dope (1919), A tiny spaniel lay beside the fire, his beady black eyes following the nervous movements of the master of the house. Chronicles, p. 167: A tiny spaniel lay at the guy's feet, the dog's beady black eyes following the nervous movements of his master. Then there's this - Chronicles, page 50: \"Suspense always had a creaking door more horrible-sounding than any door you could imagine \u2014 nerve-wracking, stomach-turning tales week after week.\" Raised on Radio by Gerald Nachman, page 313: \"The writing of each play, over the years, has been a nerve wracking, stomach-turning, head-spinning series of week-after-week crises.\" Chronicles, page 51: \"I asked the guy who made the sound effects for the radio shows how he got the sound of the electric chair and he said it was bacon sizzling. What about broken bones? The guy took a LifeSaver and crushed it between his teeth\" Raised on Radio by Gerald Nachman, page 313\" \"His scare tactics included the sound of a man frying in the electric chair (sizzling bacon), bones being snapped (spareribs or Life Savers crushed between teeth)...\" Chronicles, page 26: \"...he was like an old wolf, gaunt and battle-scarred...\" Call of the Wild : \"Then an old wolf, gaunt and battle-scarred, came forward.\" Walking back to the main house, I caught a glimpse of the sea through the leafy boughs of the pines. I wasn't near it, but could feel the power beneath its colors. (Chronicles, p. 162) Compare that to this longer passage from Marcel Proust's Within a Budding Grove: But when, Mme. de Ville-parisis\u2019s carriage having reached high ground, I caught a glimpse of the sea through the leafy boughs of trees, then no doubt at such a distance those temporal details which had set the sea, as it were, apart from nature and history disappeared ... But on the other hand I was no longer near enough to the sea which seemed to me not a living thing now, but fixed; I no longer felt any power beneath its colours, spread like those of a picture among the leaves, through which it appeared as inconsistent as the sky and only of an intenser blue. I don't think there can be any doubt that Bob had to have consciously taken these sentences and, with some revision, passed them off as his own. Another example is from a book that I imagine Dylan knows well, Huckleberry Finn: Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides, nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. ... There warn't a sound there; everybody was asleep. And now look at Chronicles, p. 165: One night when everyone was asleep and I was sitting at the kitchen table, nothing on the hillside but a shiny bed of lights ... My last exhibit (a less exact quote) comes from a book called Really the Blues (1946) by Mezz Mezzrow and Bernard Wolfe, in which a hipster introduces \"his chick\" to Mezzrow: Baby this that powerful man with that good grass that'll make you tip through the highways and byways like a Maltese kitten. Mezz, this is my new dinner and she's a solid viper. And now, part of Dylan's description of his friend Ray's girl, Chloe Kiel: She was cool as pie, hip from head to toe, a Maltese kitten, a solid viper \u2014 always hit the nail on the head. I don't know how much weed she smoked, but a lot. (Chronicles, p. 102) And later in Really the Blues, a black man was \"sitting there actually talking to a white woman cool as pie.\" Now what are we to think of these \"borrowings\"? I know that borrowing and revising tunes and song lyrics is standard practice in folk and blues music, and Dylan has done plenty of that, quite openly, as have others. That doesn't bother me. But in a sustained piece of prose that is not meant to be sung or played, but taken as the author's own composition, it is not standard practice. In the instances given above, I think Bob comes pretty close to real plagiarism, and for all I know there are more instances in Chronicles yet to be identified. Frankly, as a Dylan fan from way back, I'm a little disappointed. Say it ain't so, Bob. UPDATE: A couple more. Jack London, Children of the Frost: \"Rum meeting place, though,\" he added, casting an embracing glance over the primordial landscape ... Chronicles, p. 167: I cast an embracing glance over the primordial landscape ... Jack London, Tales of the Klondyke: Another tremendous section of the glacier rumbled earthward. The wind whipped in at the open doorway ... Chronicles, p. 217: Wind whipped in the open doorway and another kicking storm was rumbling earthward. UPDATE II: Yet more: Sax Rohmer, Dope (1919), A tiny spaniel lay beside the fire, his beady black eyes following the nervous movements of the master of the house. Chronicles, p. 167: A tiny spaniel lay at the guy's feet, the dog's beady black eyes following the nervous movements of his master. London, Children of the Frost: And then they are amazingly simple. No complexity about them, no thousand and one subtle ramifications to every single emotion they experience. They love, fear, hate, are angered, or made happy, in common, ordinary, and unmistakable terms. Chronicles, p. 169: Yet to me, it's amazingly simple, no complications, everything pans out. As long as the things you see don't go by in a blur of light and shade, you're okay. Love, fear, hate, happiness all in unmistakable terms, a thousand and one subtle ramifications. UPDATE III (Oct. 2): Jack London, Tales of the Klondyke: Through this the afternoon sun broke feebly, throwing a vague radiance to earth, and unreal shadows. Chronicles, p. 112: The afternoon sun was breaking, throwing a vague radiance to the earth. Jack London, White Fang: He carried himself with pride, as though, forsooth, he had achieved a deed praiseworthy and meritorious. Chronicles, p. 63: He didn't need to say much\u2014you knew he had been through a lot, achieved some great deed, praiseworthy and meritorious, yet unspoken about it. R. L. Stevenson, Providence and the Guitar: As Leon looked at her, in her low-bodied maroon dress, with her arms bare to the shoulder, and a red flower set provocatively in her corset, he repeated to himself for the many hundredth time that she was one of the loveliest creatures in the world of women. Chronicles, p. 127: I bought a red flower for my wife, one of the loveliest creatures in the world of women. On and on it goes. They found dozens of phrases from a single issue of Time magazine April 1961 embedded in Dylan's text - clearly he wanted to give a lot of pungent contemporary detail in his memories of Greenwich Village and instead of doing what most writers would do, soaking himself in the writings of the time & then writing his own account in his own words, he assembled his memoir by taking the phrases he liked verbatim. Plagiarism I think is legally defined as consisting of seven words in an identical sequence, and I don't think Bob ever does precisely that, so, legally, maybe, he isn't a plagiarist. But it sure feels like he is. I loved this book and I'm quite shaken up to find out all this stuff. Rabid Dylan fans are brushing the whole thing aside, saying oh well, if you scrutinised any book by anyone else as much as Chronicles has been you'd find the same. But that's just insane, of course you wouldn't. So there it is. ****** SOME INVESTIGATIVE WORK IS TO BE FOUND HERE: http://expectingrain.com/discussions/... http://ralphriver.blogspot.com/2006/0... http://newhavenreview.com/wp-content/... ************************************************ THE ORIGINAL RAVE REVIEW \u201cEverybody\u2019s wearing a disguise/To hide what they\u2019ve got left behind their eyes\u201d \u2013 okay, so what\u2019s Bob got left behind his eyes? A billion synapses connected to a million memories, that\u2019s what, and they burn with an intensity that only sharpens as he finally gets some of them down on paper. Quotable quotes leap from every page. On Guthrie: \u201cFor me it was like an epiphany, like some heavy anchor had just plunged into the waters of the harbour.\u201d On reading American history: \u201cI crammed my head full of as much of this stuff as I could stand and locked it away in my mind out of sight, left it alone. Figured I could send a truck back for it later.\u201d On the year 1962: \u201cThe whole city was dangling in front of my nose. I had a vivid idea of where everything was.\u201d At least half of this book is \u201cPortrait of the Artist as a Young Bohemian Folkie\u201d. \u201cWhat I was going to do as soon as I left home was just call myself Robert Allen\u2026\u201d but then there was a sax player called David Allyn, and that looked good. So he changed to Robert Allyn \u2013 \u201cmore exotic, more inscrutable\u201d. Then later \u201cI\u2019d seen some poems by Dylan Thomas. Dylan and Allyn sounded similar. Robert Dylan. Robert Allyn. I couldn\u2019t decide \u2013 the letter D came on stronger.\u201d He breathlessly captures the entrancement folk songs laid on his 19 year old self : \u201cFolk music was a reality of a more brilliant dimension\u2026 It was life magnified\u2026I scheduled my life around it\u201d. To us here in 2009, it looks like Bob became a folk star with very little effort, but he had to take a couple of lumps on the way. After memorising the whole Woody Guthrie songbook, a guy he describes as the Minneapolis Commissioner of the Folk Police escorts him to a phonograph player and plays him Ramblin\u2019 Jack Elliott, who'd already been doing pinpoint recreations of Woody for years. \u201cI felt like I\u2019d been cast into sudden hell\u2026 Elliott was far beyond me\u201d. After 100 pages on the Greenwich Village scene, we jump to 1966 and the tone darkens. Since 1963 he\u2019d been continually hyped and glorified \u2013 \u201cthe conscience of a generation\u201d and so on. It became intolerable. He tried to get out of the pressure cooker by moving to Woodstock but he found that \u201croadmaps to our homestead must have been posted in all fifty states for gangs of dropouts and druggies.\u201d Under seige on all sides, he used the minor motorcycle accident of 1966 to get some breathing space but the pressure never let up. Even his friends piled it on \u2013 in one jarring page Dylan tells of a car ride during which Robbie Robertson asks \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re gonna take it?\u201d Take what? \u201cYou know, the whole music scene.\u201d Dylan: \u201cIt was like dealing with a conspiracy. No place was far enough away. I don\u2019t know what everyone else was fantasizing about, but what I was fantasizing about was a nine-to-five existence, a house on a tree lined block with a white picket fence, pink roses in the back yard. That would have been nice\u2026 After a while you learn that privacy is something you can sell, but you can\u2019t buy it back.\u201d Around that time he went to see a business broker looking over a portfolio of businesses for sale, in a futile attempt to get out of the show business into something less insane, like curtain rods or freight haulage. Sometimes the story of Bob Dylan is exactly like the Life of Brian: Bob: You don't need to follow me. You don't need to follow anybody! You've got to think for yourselves. You're all individuals! Bob\u2019s many followers, after a pause: Tell us how to think for ourselves, O Bob! There\u2019s nothing at all about going electric, nothing about Christianity, nothing about Rolling Thunder. Instead of those dramas, Bob regales us with ninety-pages on the making of one of his albums \u2013 song by song, session by session. Wow \u2013 which one? Could it be Freewheelin\u2019, or Blonde on Blonde? Blood on the Tracks perhaps? Nope, of course it\u2019s Oh Mercy. (Expect similar treatment of Knocked Out Loaded in Volume Two.) This section includes six pages on a truly crackbrained theory about all popular music being based on the number 2, but Lonnie Johnson one time showed him how you could base it on the number three. Hey, whoah there - three??\u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know why the number 3 is more metaphysically powerful than the number 2, but it is.\u201d He explains how this way of performing will revolutionise his art: \u201cMy playing was going to be an impellant in equanimity to my voice and I would use different algorithms that the ear is not accustomed to.\u201d Say what, Bob? Come again? But a few pages later we also get Bob\u2019s delight in buying a bumper sticker which said \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Grandpa\u201d. This is a man of many parts. Chronicles is stuffed full of Bob\u2019s Most Memorable Characters (Fred Neil, Dave Van Ronk, John Hammond, Ray Gooch) and Most Memorable Records (including a great section where Hammond gives him an advance copy of King of the Delta Blues Singers by Robert Johnson, and an account of How \u201cPirate Jenny\u201d Changed My Life). There\u2019s funny accounts of the folk purists versus the commercialisers. The whole book is drenched in music. You\u2019re tapping your foot as you read. Well, okay, but what about the private life? It\u2019s a little strange there. I was thinking he\u2019s just going to avoid the whole subject but no \u2013 right at the end, a sweet few pages on Suze Rotolo (the tone of which is considerably at variance with her public reminiscences) and a portrait of Joan Baez \u2013 \u201cshe seemed very mature, seductive, intense, magical. Nothing she did didn\u2019t work\u201d \u2013 before he got to meet her. Aww. But no, no Sara. Discretion and the usual cabal of lawyers would have made sure of that. And in the Oh Mercy section, many mentions of \u201cmy wife\u201d but never is she named. Pretty odd. So. Don\u2019t look back? I should coco. When Bob looks back, it\u2019s warm, inclusive, annoying, incomprehensible, panoramic, diamond hard, inspirational, and it\u2019s book of the month, no contest. **** The Peter Lang Anecdote Peter Lang, a great fingerstyle guitarist, was booked to play at Stamford Arts Centre by my friend David who manages it. After the gig Peter came back to David's house and amongst other things told us his Dylan Anecdote. So this is from memory. 'I was working on a project in Minneapolis with David Zimmerman, Bob's brother. One day I called David. A very famous voice answered the phone. I said \"Er.... is that Bob?\" He said \"Yeah, this is Bob\". Wow! I thought hard. What should be the first thing you ask Bob Dylan? Eventually I said \"Is David there?\" Bob said \"Sure, I'll get him.\" And that was my first and last conversation with Bob Dylan.' ...more Positively Fraud Street? I see you on the street I always act surprised I say, \u201cHow does it feel?\u201d But I don\u2019t mean it. \"I can't taste your words,\" You said, \"Your songs are just lies.\" So I cried that you were deaf, You'd lost the sight in your eyes. And I said that you were wrong When you accused me of theft But all I really wanted to know was What else have you got left? No, I never wasted any time, And I never took much.

It was far easier just To steal it. Lest I be misunderstood They weren't any heartbreaks I embraced No, I was a master thief And all I did was rob them. You think I got a lotta nerve To say I am your friend But in my academic gown I just stand here grinning.

Funny how it emphasizes what no one really wants to know -- \"New Morning\" and \"Oh Mercy\" era stuff instead of everything from \"Hard Rain's Gonna Fall\" to \"Visions of Johanna\" to \"Shelter From the Storm\" to \"Isis.\" Those songs are hardly mentioned at all -- maybe one or two mentions of \"Hard Rain.\" Otherwise, this is a compulsively readable, folksy, lightly insightful, non-linear self-portrait of the mythic artist as regular guy from the North Country, a family man more concerned with privacy than popularity, a devout Woody Guthrie fanatic of course, not someone particularly special -- emphatically NOT the messiah, NOT the chosen one, NOT the voice of his generation, NOT the leader of the revolution -- umm except he acknowledges that, for a time, he could see and describe and supercharge the deep truth of reality. This ellipitically argues that his success came from casual, wide-open exposure to the world and art (more than just music). He's a super-sensitive empty vessel blessed with the necessary restless desire for MORE, sufficient native critical faculties, just enough OCD, and more than enough midwestern simplicity and charm -- that's pretty much it, says Dylan (not that he can be trusted). Looking forward to volume 2 where he colors in the circles he's drawn in this one.

I read the review thinking of him as Jokerman, and that movie made of him where others play him as characters throughout, and all the disguises he wore on stage, always, and always bullshitting us with lies at interviews, always spoofing. Wondered if the plagiarism might be the same, or sampling. But the research suggests something more deliberate and not just kiddingly deceptive. I need to think about that. But I don't think he got the Nobel for this book, anyway, but for the lyrics, which I absolutely am ecstatic about! ...more Each phrase comes at you from a ten-foot drop, scuttles across the road and then another one comes like a punch on the chin.

I bought myself G.W. Pabst's film version of TPO for this recent Christmas and I was absolutely riveted by Lotte Lenya's performance of the song, she's so cold , so decisive, much like Thomas Mann's Naphta. I was not a stranger to the song, having been moved for years by Nina Simone's rendition. My first encounter, however, happened years before when I was vacationing in Rome. Foot-sore, yet exhilarated, we had been walking all day and came across publicity posters for an Italian performer scheduled to play that evening the songs of Brecht/Weill in both German and Italian. For the life of me, I can't remember the name of the young woman -- but she owned the songs and all of us in attendance. One of the documentaries on the Three Penny Opera relates Brecht's penchant for appropriation, \"he stole, but with genius.\" I've heard many similar references to Picasso and it is simply coincidence that Dylan next speaks of Guernica and Pablo P after his rumination on Pirate Jenny. How better could one loop the wonky arc of Chronicles than to situate the book (and its legion of complains of plagiarism) alongside such earlier masters of Love and Theft. ...more Mark my words, this book is going to be considered as an American classic piece of literature.

What I saw in this book was his inspiration. You will NEVER get this in any biography about any artist. Or at least rarely. Biographies and even autobiographies are a way for the \"experts\" to place the person in history. Dylan is more than willing to allow the music critics and even historians to do that (yes he acknowledges that he is a historical figure--and he is pretty humbled by it I assume). Just don't expect him to really care. They can pour through volumes of interviews (those that he gave that revealed something of the \"inner-Bob\") and articles and talk to hundreds of friends and relatives. They will still never KNOW the subject completely. Bob Dylan proved that with this book. The book is \"rambling\" for some, but I found this stream-of-consciousness style to be refreshing and definitely influenced by Jack Kerouac or Woody Guthrie--who he has been most compared. His story telling reminded my of a grandfather or the fascinating older man down the neighborhood who would entertain you with stories. Yes they \"rambled\" and digressed into other subjects. But they were REAL and true and revealed something about the speaker. I am sure when the book came out almost 4 years ago, people thought \"FINALLY he will give us a true picture of his life and influences!\" And then they were bitterly disappointed. Bob Dylan has always done things his owne way and refuses to be pigeon-holed into wherevever even his fans want him to be. That is what makes him THE artist for the last half of 20th Century and still into today! He wants true freedom--freedom from being who even millions of people demand him to be. A freedom we all should strive for. I look forward to reading Volume II and III or IV if ever writes them. And, finally, CONGRATS on the PULITZER PRIZE, BOB! You were overdue, but I hope your best stuff is still to come and you can collectively tell the music critics and fans that haven't let go of the '60's to shove it! ...more I'm really not a big Dylan fan per se, but that he is an amazing poet cannot be denied.

On writing Everything is Broken \"The semantic meaning is all in the sounds of the words. The lyrics are your dance partner. It works on a mechanical level. Everything is broken or it looks that way - chipped, cracked, in need of repair. Things are broken, then rebroken, made into something else, then broken again. Once when I was lying on the beach in Coney Island, I saw a portable radio in the sand... and it was broken ... I thought of all the best things in the world, the things I had a great affection for. Sometimes it might be a place ... but then these places become broken, too, and can't be pieced back together.\" Tidbits like this, little insights into his creative process... truly inspiring.

The two sections that deal with him moving to Minneapolis and then New York are, for the most part, pretty good, and his takes on Robert Johnson, Joan Baez, and, of course, Woody Guthrie--among many others--does help create a somewhat captivating picture of a certain, crystallized moment in American history as through the eyes of one of its great observers. And if you're a Dylan fan, it might be worth checking out for those sections alone, as its a quick read, but don't expect anything earth-shattering. UPDATE: Re-read in September 2008 for a class. Much better the second time around, maybe I just expected too much the first time, or maybe I've just changed my mind as to what Dylan is as an artist.

Su personalidad esquizoide, su inter\u00e9s por despistar parece que se manifiesta desde su juventud, cuando miente incluso a desconocidos sobre su vida y hasta sobre su forma de llegar a Nueva York. Dedica unas p\u00e1ginas a hablar de la biblioteca de unos amigos y sus conocimientos literarios parece que dejan mucho que desear (\u201cBalzac es hilarante...\u201d, p. 54). La literatura seg\u00fan Bob Dylan se reduce a: \u201c(Los cantantes folk) eran capaces de expresar en unos pocos versos lo mismo que un libro entero.\u201d (p. 47) Tiene un estilo dejado, plagado de afirmaciones absurdas, rotundas, exageradas, exc\u00e9ntricas en ocasiones. \u201cSus palabras me parecieron misteriosas y desacertadas, pero si las dijo, las dijo y ya est\u00e1.\u201d (p. 81) A veces parece que nos est\u00e1 tomando el pelo, como cuando dedica unos p\u00e1rrafos a hablar del l\u00edder radical Joe Hill, a quien se dedic\u00f3 un canci\u00f3n de la que \u00e9l parece hacer mofa en otra suya (St. Agustin). Incluso insulta a su p\u00fablico (p. 162). Dedica un cap\u00edtulo entero a lloriquear por el mal momento que atravesaba a finales de los ochenta. Lamentos de los que uno no acaba de entender cu\u00e1l es la causa y da la sensaci\u00f3n de ser un llor\u00f3n quejica: sus conciertos no le dicen nada, los hace mec\u00e1nicamente, no quiere ensayar ni tocar canciones antiguas y emblem\u00e1ticas, busca un nuevo centro de realidad permanente. Para colmo de sus males, dice, \u201cmi velero de 20 metros de eslora hab\u00eda encallado contra un arrecife en Panam\u00e1\" (p. 170). S\u00ed, ya lo sabemos, los ricos tambi\u00e9n lloran. Tampoco entiendo a qu\u00e9 viene dedicar cuatro p\u00e1ginas con las insustancialidades de un exc\u00e9ntrico llamado Sun Pie que regenta una tienda que Dylan visita en una ocasi\u00f3n. Simplemente creo que se est\u00e1 quedando con el lector. En fin, he de reconocer que mi admiraci\u00f3n por este buen se\u00f1or se limita a su m\u00fasica y su manera de cantar. Su penosa intervenci\u00f3n en Live Aid, pidiendo que parte del dinero recaudado para luchar contra la hambruna en Etiop\u00eda se dedicara a ayudar los granjeros norteamericanos con dificultades le llen\u00f3 de gloria. ...more When I was maybe six or seven, and already beginning my lifelong devotion to music, and rock in particular, I remember standing in the Record Department at Arlan's looking at the 45s, since my mother said I could get 5, if my brother and I could agree.

Retard!!\" Not the same guy, indeed, (actually, I was probably thinking of Dion), and we did not buy that 45 that day, nor was I to give Dylan my rapt attention until about ten years later. And then for the next 30 or so. I even went to see him during that Awful Gospel Period where he sped-played all his greatest hits. Would it be an exaggeration to say I became a poetry lover because of Bobby? This book sent me off to look at and listen to things I hadn't in the past. Now that I had the source's insight. It made me understand the spot he put himself in as The Protest King and why he traded it in to be King's Jester instead. You would have done it too, if you were him, with the same desire to make art, not war. Dylan, in unsurprising fashion, does not give away the great secrets people have been longing to hear, but he is more candid than one might expect. I'm not arguing that everything he says here is true, or how much is imagined just enough to keep his chameleon lights going. I was amused, for example, that the great minstrel was still a bit of a fanboy, tracking down the residences and places of significance for various rock legends he admired--I won't give away spoilers for this. No surprising, his narrative voice is penetrating and clear. He is as good at autobiography as he is a song writing. He is witty, pithy, cryptic, folksy, sage, romantic, and sarcastic. But not as frequently as you might think. He is also hilarious, which you probably did (think). And if you like his words, but not his voice so much, especially in these latter years, well, this is the place for you, my friend. Oh, yeah, and there were people who called him Bobby.... ...more Wow! A dense, extraordinary approach to an auto-biography. Dylan was never going to write a conventional biography, and readers who want one should keep on walking. This isn't for them. Instead Dylan has constructed a mythology as autobiography. While I think it's fair to assume that everything in this book is true, I think we should probably accept that it's not necessarily literal. He's obviously missed large chunks out for a start - the book really only covers a couple of periods in his life. Wow! A dense, extraordinary approach to an auto-biography.

Having accepted these criteria for the autobiography, it's a fascinating book, certainly providing an insight into how he sees his own life, and more interestingly, into his state of mind while making the key album Oh Mercy . ...more https://msarki.tumblr.com/post/151352...

The year 1965 brought us to terms with Bob Dylan and his outrageous and defiantly autonomous behavior with the Columbia Records release of Highway 61 Revisited . Dylan was by this time extremely tired of the press, their questions, the long tours, and was hiding out in Woodstock, New York. Now everything was going to change even more. It wasn't enough to just have Johnny Cash. Bob Dylan's Chronicles Volume One , published in 2004, was ignored initially by me. I was fatigued as much as Dylan ever would be while listening for years to his mumbling and mingling of words that rarely made sense. I believed the pundits' claims that he lied, that he cheated and he stole, and that he seemed to use somebody every step of his creative way. Dylan was great, but he would be no friend of mine. But after reading Jonathan Lethem's book of essays, Ecstasy of Influence , I had a change of heart. Lethem persuaded me to read Dylan's book. He made it seem worthwhile. My first impression with Chronicles Volume One was a similarity felt several years ago when I read On The Road by Jack Kerouac. It was written in a rambling form, rarely staying on topic unless it was something Dylan actually wanted to teach us about, and then, if that was the case, he could go on for pages detailing the composition of each song on a particular album or his music theory regarding his formula using common math and geometry in order to possibly make something from nothing. A kind of magic he said he performed. Except this book that Dylan was writing, seemingly as I was reading it, and please, do we have to call it stream of consciousness ? Do we? In fact, the book was more for my age and time than Kerouac's, and more about the things that interested me growing up. And knowing that Dylan has remained pretty much true to himself through all these years was a continuing comfort as I read this in comparison to On The Road as that book conjures up for me the misogynistic and sexually confused and drunken Kerouac of his later years. One thing Dylan did not talk about in Chronicles Volume One was his making in 1972 of the fine Sam Peckinpah film Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid , providing songs and backing music for the movie, and playing the role of Alias, a member of Billy's gang. His acting was quite good and his music perfect for the film. It is also important to note for those of us depressed, frustrated, lost, or currently thinking about ending it all, Dylan's book is full of inspiration. This book is an artist's smorgasbord. You have to pay rapt attention though as it is hard to say where he is at any chronological time in his life, as he shuffles back and forth quite regularly. I think he does it on purpose just to mess us up. His prose is actually quite brilliant in places. He chooses his words as if they matter on the page. It certainly could be, and is unfortunately, a rational argument that Dylan is rewriting his own history. Much of what he says could well be lies, but his syntax seems and reads like the truth. Through all my years of half-wittingly following his personal life, I never knew about his wife and five kids living with him in Woodstock, New York. Of course I knew about his famous love, Sarah, but he resists using her name in the book. He speaks almost generically about his loves in a way that if the reader didn't know any better he would think Dylan is speaking always so lovingly about the very same person. All the man's significant lovers can get confusing except towards the end of the book when he focuses by name on his early relationship with Suze Rotolo and an admiring and respectful page or two about Joan Baez. He credits Rotolo with introducing him to many art forms that would have a lasting and instrumental effect on his work to come. Dylan tells about the folk song Pirate Jenny heard and studied religiously by him while living with Suze Rotolo. The song reminded him of the painting Guernica by Picasso which made me immediately think of the painter Red Grooms who Dylan was speaking about a few pages earlier in the book when he said, \"...the way everything he did crushed itself into some fragile world, the rackety cluster of parts all packed together and then, standing back, you could see the complex whole of it all.\" Without Rotolo's influence Dylan thinks he may never have written the songs he did. He goes on quite a bit about why, and the text seems helpful to anyone wishing to spend this time with somebody trying to teach or show how he did what he did. I felt the section pretty remarkable even if it was completely full of shit. I am not saying that it was. There was a whole chapter devoted to the making of his album Oh Mercy! while hiding down in New Orleans in 1989. Dylan confesses to his song, Man in a Long Black Coat , as being his own I Walk the Line . One of his favorite lines from I Walk the Line by Johnny Cash was, \"I keep a close watch on this heart of mine.\" And if you think about it, a pretty fine line you must admit. I found it interesting that Mr. Dylan enjoyed ravaging through his friends' libraries and learning all he could about almost every topic that interested him. I also found it endearing that Dylan coveted the honorary diploma he received, but not the discomfort of standing on the stage in cap and gown listening to people who did not know him define inaccurately who he was to the listening audience. I enjoyed Dylan describe in detail his crazy new mathematical music theory he discovered to revive his waning career. I like that David Crosby was his friend and Dylan said that the man never fitted in, especially while a member of an earlier version of one of my favorite incarnations of all-time, The Byrds of the seventies. But the story of how Bob Dylan got his name is a brilliant piece that hooked me into anything he might later go on to say. And so what if the book is all made-up and pieces of it lifted from other written records already made? Let's give the man a break. After composing thousands of songs it is amazing to me that he can remember much of anything, especially now at his age. I loved hearing about his father and his visits with his family. Born in Duluth and raised in Hibbing, Minnesota. The piece about visiting his grandmother who also lived in Duluth was great, his eventual move to the twin cities to make a song-and-dance-man of himself, his sleeping for a time in a cousin's fraternity house and having to move when the other boys returned from summer vacation was typical of Bob Dylan's humor and personality. Dylan admitted to copying Woody Guthrie in every way he could. It was hilarious to me, in a cleverly snide way, when Jon Pankake introduced Dylan to the music of Ramblin' Jack Elliott who, as Pankake eagerly seemed to demonstrate to Dylan, was already doing Guthrie better than Dylan ever could or would. So Bob Dylan did the sensible thing and decided to copy them both. Bob Dylan's Chronicles Volume One is the perfect read for the serious art student willing to go to any length to make a permanent mark on the stage. ...more In some ways a beautiful book.

On recording the maligned New Morning : Maybe there were good songs in the grooves and maybe there weren\u2019t \u2013 who knows? But they weren\u2019t the kind where you hear an awful roaring in your head. I knew what those kind of songs were like and these weren\u2019t them. It\u2019s not like I hadn\u2019t any talent, I just wasn\u2019t feeling the full force of the wind... Truth was the last thing on my mind, and even if there was such a thing, I didn\u2019t want it in my house. Now maybe he did consciously think this at the time. Or maybe he was just lost. Or was it then that he consciously decided to be lost? Later, of the early eighties, he says: The mirror had swung around and I could see the future \u2013 an old actor fumbling in garbage cans outside the theatre of past triumphs.

In these chapters, Dylan is any rockstar telling his story. In the chapters on his rise to stardom, he\u2019s the prematurely old man in Poe\u2019s \u2018A Descent into the Maelstrom\u2019, telling of how he lashed himself to a barrel, threw himself in and survived. Now me, I could read about that maelstrom forever, whether it\u2019s Dylan about to dive in in the sixties or Kurt Cobain in the nineties, and it\u2019s rare to get it from the horse\u2019s mouth. For that, this book is priceless. Well-written too. For the rest, it\u2019s a testament to the price of survival. ...more I have to be careful with music.

Conversely, I can't count the number of people I like immediately only to find in that original interaction some lie hiding, waiting to be unmasked. Music never lies. Either I connect with a piece of music instantly or I never will. It's spontaneous truth, love in real time. I wish I could remember first hearing Bob Dylan, but whenever that first chance meeting occurred, it is lost to me now. What I do recall is hiking through my hometown to deliver twenty scrimped and saved dollars to a guy from school who had agreed to illegally download Dylan's entire discography for me. He handed me a burned DVD containing dozens of albums. It was incredible. As fantastic and inspiring as it would have been to hear these albums when they were released--to wait for a record store to open some morning to be among the first to stride home with tunnel vision for the turntable on top of the bookshelf--hearing them together, all of them at once was a different kind of wonderful. Something in the music was right, for me, for that time in my life. The albums kept coming. When I went to college I got a job at the ill-fated Borders Books, Music & Cafe. I remember slitting open the box of Together through Life the Tuesday it was released. Listening to it on the overhead that day, the lyric about James Joyce sent me into ecstasies. Tempest was playing while I worked driving a forklift in the receiving bay of a hardware store. My wife and I listened to Fallen Angels while driving Highway 12 between Cuchara and La Veta. Bob Dylan is ingrained in my life in ways I don't yet understand, may never understand. <+++>Chronicles, Vol. 1</+++> reveals a side of Dylan unavailable in his music. His prose is charmingly clunky, like a 20th Century Huck Finn. Metaphors clash and combine, and the energy in his voice is that of a much younger man. New Orleans is so vivid in his telling. Winter in New York and the bookshelves that awaited his arrival. A rusting Buick he plans to disassemble before the arc-welder. <+++>Chronicles, Vol. 1</+++> works like music, even though it's words.

A complete world brought to life. Ruminations and the joy of learning and discovery: Dylan's own and his conveyance of it to us. Dylan's highlights aren't the highlights of traditional biographers; they're his own and they make you understand his inner thought processes, his mind, his self better than a bland externalized treatment. Another thing that's great about this is how funny it is. Dylan has a wicked sense of humor. HALFWAY: A frequent thematic element of the book is Dylan's war with the media and his public image, his battle against the idea that he was/is \"the voice of a generation.\" His evasiveness, elusiveness and parrying, he says, were intentional. The strategy seems to have worked, and yet the elusiveness seems only to have made him an even more mystical and mythical figure, opening him up to even more iconographic treatment by the media, the critics, the sycophants. I'm not sure Dylan fully realizes the backlash resulting from his attitude. It's a complex and uneasy dance, but it has worked for him nonetheless, for, despite charges of \"selling out\" by various sectors of his critical and fan base through the years, it's hard to imagine an artist who has managed a more solid balance, in general, of critical street cred and commercial success. In discussing his \"middle period\", which seems to have begun with \"Nashville Skyline\" (an album he talks about at length but never mentions by name; indeed, he rarely seems to mention any of his albums by name), he admits to his creative drought, self-doubt and failings. This is an observational autobiography; a ramble perhaps, but it hangs together due to Dylan's sweet turns of phrase and often profound musings, mostly flavored by an impish bemusement. Further in: Dylan ruminates on how he found a self charging General Electric portable radio in the sand on the beach -- built like a tank -- and yet it is broken; this leads to a lovely passage about how all things become broken. And it led to the writing of a song. This book is like that. FINAL: This is about what Dylan sees and thinks. And about people he's met and what they said. It's not chronological; it has its own internal logic, and it's an incredible book. Highest recommendation. ...more With the breathing room that time brings I can see why Dylan came off as the arrogant smarty pants he did as caught in Eat The Document and other interviews of the time.

To his credit he chose this path rather than wearing the ego trip mantle \"Spokesman For A Generation\" that they were trying to fit him for. Its for that reason that this book came out at the perfect time, interest is still high and everyone, well ok not everyone, had stopped hyperventilating to the point where he felt free enough to write about a fascinating time in which he played a big role. I wondered how his prose would be as to my mind his poetry is sublime and I found him engaging and able to sustain this narrative in a compelling and sympathetic voice. Having just finished Dissident Gardens I was reminded of Chronicles. Dylan was heir to a broken promise in leftist ideology. So many hitched their belief and hard work for social justice to the star of Stalin only to see it revealed for nothing more than betrayal, another dictatorship. This led to a bitterness and a feeling of \"no direction home\" that found some expression and home in the Civil Rights movement and the hippie counterculture in the later '60's. More than any other artist he navigated that road successfully despite many telling him he was going the wrong way. His success was measured in his continuing relevance, not easily achieved. Chronicles is a chance to hear the object of so much prose tell his own story. I saw Dylan live in 2005 and at this time his shows were notable for the fact that his words were almost completely unintelligible! Merle Haggard played first and you could understand him so it was not the sound system. At first this was frustrating. People were asking each other, \"what song is this?\" \" It think it's \"All Along The Watchtower\". \"Really, I love that song!\" But this is Dylan, an artist for whom vagueness has become part of his pallet in service of staying true in the glare of hype and overexposure. There is some of that in this autobiography as well, I was left satisfied but wanting more. For me that's the way it should be. ...more Chronicles Vol. 1 has a few moments of insight concerning Dylan's musical influences and non-linear remembrances from his past, small vignettes that are often unrevealing in regards to the overall scope of the enigmatic artist's life.

Dylan does ramble at length about the difficulties of fame, his stalkers, and his unwillingness to be a \"spokesperson\" for anything. That much feels very real and reveals a softer, family oriented Dylan we don't often see. There are other moments in his writing that fall apart quite spectacularly, especially as Dylan drones on endlessly about some new mathematical algorithm that freed him musically in the mid-80's, but which he mindlessly doesn't incorporate into his recollections of performances or in his recordings. He merely explains this new musical epiphany(rather abstractly and without clarity), stops himself short and then skips to some other unrelated period of his life. It's just one of many hiccups that occur throughout the text, revisiting why Dylan's previous works, Tarantula most notably, was critically denounced decades ago. Chronicles Vol. 1 is book-ended by recollections of his early days in New York and his start with Columbia Records. In between is a focus on New Morning (a relatively unessential album) and a painfully long exposition on the frustrating process of recording Oh Mercy. Both these sections show just how difficult it is to write at length about the vagaries of the creative process, something even Dylan can't do with any real clarity. Scattered throughout are some interesting moments from Dylan's past, advice given to him along the way, and friends who lent couches to crash on. It is these small fragments which are the most entertaining, but you have to sift through a lot of nonsense to get to it. Fortunately, the language is not overwhelming and true Dylan aficionados will blaze through the 300 odd pages rather quickly, despite its rather erratic assembly. If you are someone obsessed by Dylan, then surely have a look at Chronicles Vol. 1, otherwise steer yourself to some of the better \"unauthorized\" biographies out there. ...more Interesant\u0103 lectur\u0103.

Such a class actor, he doesn't try to imitate Dylan's voice, but gets the vibe across of what Bob Dylan is, well, chronicling. Dylan, the old chameleon, doesn't give much away about himself, but all the same, being one of the greatest writers of the Twentieth Century, albeit a songwriter and poet, he describes the people and times of Greenwich Village.

I've always been in awe of Dylan's innate confidence in his ability, and intelligence in his early years of which his work is testament. When thinking of a gift for someone, something like this is always good value. The giftee will not only enjoy the gift again over the years but will remember who gave it to them. ...more the song & dance man is clearly the finest songwriter in the history of american music, thus, not surprisingly, the first volume of his autobiography is written quite well. though many of his fans, upon learning that dylan was penning his memoirs, were hoping for a linear account of his days from alienated minnesota youth to worldwide phenomenon, this book is anything but (as if bobby d would ever do what others were expecting of him). all told, however, this is an intimate and forthright gl the song & dance man is clearly the finest songwriter in the history of american music, thus, not surprisingly, the first volume of his autobiography is written quite well. though many of his fans, upon learning that dylan was penning his memoirs, were hoping for a linear account of his days from alienated minnesota youth to worldwide phenomenon, this book is anything but (as if bobby d would ever do what others were expecting of him). all told, however, this is an intimate and forthright glance into portions of the troubadour's life, when he could have as easily taken the stories with him to his grave. \"i had a vivid idea of where everything was. the future was nothing to worry about. it was awfully close.\" ...more There are books that are entertaining and there are books that get the neurons firing. In the process of making my scribbled notes into some sort of review, I am surprised by the range of ideas, scenes, and topics that Dylan covered. He immerses you in his flaneur-like appreciation of scenes and relationships. He studies his audience and the way people perceive him and other artists or entertainers. He lives an honest life and the adages that come from his family and himself are worthy of study. There are books that are entertaining and there are books that get the neurons firing.

He immerses you in his flaneur-like appreciation of scenes and relationships. He studies his audience and the way people perceive him and other artists or entertainers. He lives an honest life and the adages that come from his family and himself are worthy of study. He describes places like clubs or cities by their ambience and vibe. Even people can seem like an expanse of land. The combination of high and low culture with the little details about his personality are endearing. I didn\u2019t expect to be as into this book as I was. There were scenes that sparked my imagination, like what would it be like to be the waitress going around a beat club, collecting money/tips for Bob Dylan? As he switches between early periods and late periods of his life, it becomes clear how he\u2019s a product of the north country and the Cold War era, a \u201cvictim of strange fantasy\u201d living in a \u201ccloud of fear.\u201d Although he may have sampled the Old Time Radio sentence about sound effects - bacon sizzling is the electric chair and crunching a Life Saver sounds like breaking bones, it is clear that listening is a soothing and engaging activity for Dylan. I identified with his thought that a voice on the radio can \u201clay hands\u201d on you. A body-less voice can transform and transcend the power of imagination, as Dylan reveals in his praise of Brown Sugar, New Orleans DJ. His appreciation of the aspects of an era is almost philosophical. Two ideas enchant me: the idea of cultural icons as fathers who leave metaphorical families behind. Although he has a kind of disdain for his typical fan, he cultivates an academic dedication to music that has had a ripple effect throughout branches of musical genres. The second idea, that of predestination as a carnival act, particularly the Leopard Girl, is hard to grasp. Are we merely put on earth to be laughed at for things we didn\u2019t choose to be? Or are we doomed to be exploited? Some of his philosophy transcends literary metaphor and becomes almost like a parable. The idea of putting a song across is one of many ways he conflates journeys or distance with creation, emotional growth, and/or emotional intelligence. My mind is flooded with images of a song being ferried over troubled waters, or being researched, floated as a con or heist. If a song must travel, than what territory is it traversing? Is it a person\u2019s emotional pain and their lived experience? The way he describes the fabrications that turn a real figure\u2019s story into a folk song indicate that pain plus some form of creative license plus truth equal an awesome song. Dylan got me thinking about the kinds of intimacy or relationships am I looking for in or with the songs, the bands, and the artists that I love or choose to listen to. How I can be \u201cdreaming a dead dream\u201d when listening to vintage tunes. Deep thoughts, right? I like the way he reads people. He sees if a person has momentum, can help him accomplish projects, gather a band, or amplify his message. He got me thinking about how I think of my ideal audience at work, at play, or at school. And the ways in which I assume who other people\u2019s audiences are. Dylan gives the impression that one can change the entire course of one\u2019s life just by numerically changing patterns, habits. Anything to do with numbers can be adjusted to have a butterfly effect on all corresponding parts of life since the universe operates on mathematical principles. If you change your pattern or sequence, it changes the story or your impact. I wish I could\u2019ve known Bob Dylan\u2019s grandma, who told him \u201cHappiness isn\u2019t on the road to anything,\u201d that happiness is the road. Other sayings worth repeating are \u201cthe worth of things can\u2019t be measured by what they cost but by what they cost you to get it\u201d and \u201cA conceited person could be set up easily and brought down accordingly\u201d. We all have some form of fake self worth and authenticity is the only true way to avoid manipulation. Finally, \u201cYou live with what life deals you. We have to make things fit.\u201d I like how he struggles with his status as a legend, but still has the ego to say things like destiny was looking right at him, or to say that MacLeish said he \u201cinherited something metaphysical from a bygone era.\u201d I agree that he has to be an old soul, \u2018cause \u201cA folk song has over a thousand faces and you must meet them all if you want to play this stuff.\u201d I think his narratives are more interesting and memorable when tied to a location. One image I won\u2019t forget is that of him slipping into a phone booth sanctuary. It offered him the privacy, cleanliness, and quiet that couldn\u2019t be found on the busy city street. Some things were eye-opening simply because I\u2019d never heard of them before, like The King and His Court who\u2019d do fast pitch softball tricks. They were like the Harlem Globetrotters of baseball. I never knew there was a Terraplane car. There are places I want to visit, just because Dylan described them so well, like Bull\u2019s Head Tavern, a cellar tavern, where he felt John Wilkes Booth\u2019s ghost. And King Tut\u2019s Museum. I\u2019m trying to figure out where he dropped in to hear the old jazz singer on Front St. in San Rafael? Maybe Pier 15? I liked how Dylan noticed the cemeteries in New Orleans! He raved about magic, night, and ghosts. I recommend Unfathomable City if you want more about New Orleans. Perhaps the most heartbreaking story is the inspiration for \u201cDark Eyes\u201d - I\u2019ll never forget the way he described the call girl at Plaza Hotel in New Orleans. Even people are described vividly. Van Ronk is made of frosty silence, like the wind was blowing him Dylan\u2019s way. And Johnny Cash, he \u201ccould have been a cave dweller. He sounds like he\u2019s at the edge of the fire, or in the deep snow, or in a ghostly forest\u201d I could pontificate more about how he reshaped the way I think of songwriting as song architecture or how there were so many quirky details about him, but I\u2019ll end with things I\u2019m going to read or research or listen to as a result of this book: To Read: Balzac: Luck and Leather, Le Cousin Pons Evan Jones (playwright) T.S.

While you expect to hear about Dave Van Ronk, you are surprised to know that Dylan backed up Bobby Vee and ate burgers with Tiny Tim as a colleague. His lodestar, Woody Guthrie, is here at the beginning and follows throughout. The book which progresses in a non-linear (poetic license) fashion ends with more specifics on his early career.

His lodestar, Woody Guthrie, is here at the beginning and follows throughout. The book which progresses in a non-linear (poetic license) fashion ends with more specifics on his early career. I did not know of the influence of one of my favorites, Spider John Koerner, who receives a good bit of print at the end. It's a big life and long career, so to squeeze it into book, Dylan had to pick and choose. Some people and times are given cites, some paragraphs, others get a lot of space. Surely there is a lot left out. As you can expect from his lyrics, the text can be both blunt and poetic. People and experiences that catch his attention and memory can have several pages of narrative. For instance, meeting Archibald MacLeish about a potential project; a surreal conversation with Sun Pie, a Louisiana collectibles dealer; a numerical system of music; the problems of fame and the public's perception of him, and an homage to Robert Johnson. A long section on producing the \"O Mercy\" album (not mentioned by name) almost seems like an apology. He hardly seems like the man dubbed \"The voice of his generation\". The unpretentious tone is like a suburban dad looking back on his youthful times and career. He is more concerned about his family/privacy and various styles of music than political and social currents. The first glimpse of the man who wrote the \"Masters of War\" is on p. 198 when he notes that Andrew Jackson's sins would not be napalming children (although I believe he Jackson did the 19th century version). Although one has to wait until the end of the book, it's good to see Dylan address the change in his artistic content. He writes that the world for what he had something to say no longer exists. He says that writing for today's issues requires someone from today's place and time. From here he segues into his roots literally and figuratively; today's issues require a different experience than one could have growing up in a northern Minnesota mining town. He notes the poetry of the rappers is relevant for today because it comes from a today's experience. The book is written as though he is still married (although he never calls his wife by name) but he had been divorced for at least 10 years at the time of its writing. He speaks well of his X-wife (or wives, the time frame is difficult to tell if he is referring to one, the other or both), almost reverently, just as he speaks of Joan Baez, Suze Rotollo and many other colleagues and influences. There is nothing here about Dylan's spirituality, his conversion to Christianity or commitment to Judaism. His family is mentioned in vague terms. Every now and then something creeps in, like the mention of a sailboat lost in a storm that had taken the family to almost every Caribbean Island. If you are a real fan, you have probably already read this. It could be difficult those who don't know his oeuvre and/or this particular musical period. For those with a casual interest in Dylan, one of the (unauthorized) biographies would probably be more satisfying. ...more The better half of this book is about Dylan and folk records. It takes place before Dylan\u2019s first album. To him folk music is a lost art. It has old heroes. Hardly anyone cares about it, but he knows it has power. Dylan is Luke Skywalker and folk music is the force. He\u2019s going to change things with it. His guitar is his lightsaber, he carries it everywhere. he seeks out records and singers to learn their secrets, and we go on this journey with him. the best way to read this would be with youtube The better half of this book is about Dylan and folk records.

Then we get to the middle section. We skip to a much older, sadder Dylan. He doesn't want to be famous. He doesn\u2019t want to stir the pot. He doesn't want to put out records that are too good! And eventually he forgets how. He beats himself up because he can't. He\u2019s impotent. He\u2019s a sad old man. He can't play his old songs like he used to. He can't write like he used to. He doesn't even remember how he did it. His batteries ran out. He's a Christian now. While young Dylan would chew out a time magazine reporter, old Dylan has dinner with Bono. And praises him too. He praises everybody but himself. Bono recommends him a producer for a new album who Dylan immediately has friction with. The new producer does horrible mariachi band things with Dylan\u2019s recordings in the studio, he HATES it. You think, yes, finally he's going to stand up for himself... but no, he doesn\u2019t. This thread of narrative that he chooses to give us is about him overcoming his dislike of the new producer, and his methods, and learning to like it. in the end he praises the producer too. Highly. While recording he gets discouraged and goes for a motor cycle ride with his wife, has a long conversation with a weirdo at a shop that I guess was supposed to be insightful but I skipped it because it was boring. This whole part of the book feels like it was written by a completely different person. It\u2019s not exactly bad...I enjoyed reading it, it was very revealing, but this section is where it started to drag for me. Anyway... that album comes out...hmm..yup. Then we jump right back where we left off. Plucky, young Dylan. Attentive, sharp, inquisitive Dylan, on the road to that record deal. This section is full of detail, full of life, and colors. Young Dylan is a student first and songwriter second. He covers songs. He's really apprehensive about writing on his own, when he does it\u2019s to old, time-tested melodies. Old Dylan is an island. He writes some words on a piece of paper and tries to play something to it. Like a NORMAL person. He doesn\u2019t have muscle memory of a dozen legendary folk songs he just covered, and a rack of records he just marathoned the night before still going through his head. Young Dylan brought all of that to the forefront in his writing to remarkable effect. I didn't see the end coming at all...It just ends. Partly because I was reading on kindle. But that\u2019s okay, It ends on a nice note. 4/5 ...more", "Title": "Chronicles, Vol. 1"},
