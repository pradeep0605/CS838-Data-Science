(hide spoiler) ] But just to make it extra crispy clear: it isn't Rose's sluttiness that pisses me off and makes me loathe her, it's her hypocrisy and objectifying of human beings. Had she been a male character I would have called him an ass/jerk/manwhore. How many people would object to that ?! >>please refer to: comment 116 17 Apr '12 Where I come from, there are these type of girls who would literally throw themselves out at any white boy. I'm not sure why, but it seems that they have this idea that Caucasian = hotness. Boys, being boys, well ... they snatch up every opportunity. What really bugs me though, is not only the immense cheapness of these girls, but the extent to which they will go out there and hunt these western boys. Don't get too eager and start asking me where this paradise of easy sex is, though. They're not the exotic Lucy Liu goddesses; most of them are just plain... fugly. The heroine of this book reminds me a lot of those girls. Well, except she's not one of the fugly ones. This one sentence wraps it up for me: \"I was a pretty dhampir, one who didn't mind getting into trouble and pulling crazy stunts. I became a novelty; they liked having me around for the fun of it.\" Just like those girls know these foreigners only keep them around for the \"fun\" of it, and would just as easily toss them aside like a used condom. Rose Hathaway is the kind of girl who'd hook up with a guy just because he's hot. She'll be with one guy, but thinking about another. She is constantly thinking about getting with guys: \"You flirted with the other guys simply for the sake of flirting. You flirted with Jesse in the hopes of getting semi-naked with him. He was a royal Moroi, and he was so hot, he should have worn awarning: flammable sign.\" and yet when someone accuses her of being a slut, she's all indignant. What, if you don't go as far as sex, then it annuls any tendencies of sluttiness? Please. I have a lot of promiscuous friends - I'm not exactly wearing a promise ring myself - but at least have the decency to embrace your inner slut. What irritates me even more with this character is how she would then go about referring to other dhampirs who offer \"services\" to morois as \"bloodwhores\". Bitch, please - you're not so far off yourself. Hypocritical characters are just not my thing. ESPECIALLY when they don't realize they're being hypocritical, or when the author doesn't realize s/he's writing a hypocritical character. Now, there is a difference between confidence and arrogance; both I find charming in their own ways. But Rose Hathaway is neither. She is downright up herself, which is not a trait that I find endearing. I had to roll my eyes every time she described her sexiness... \"I knew I was pretty, but to Moroi boys, my body was more than just pretty: it was sexy in a risqu\u00e9 way.\" \"I knew perfectly well that there weren't a lot of girls at this school who looked as good in a bra as I did.\" The first one or two times were perhaps forgivable. But the third time around, I really couldn't help but groan. But in fact, Rose seems to be only obsessed with looks (which is odd, considering her \"occupation\" as a guardian); you'd think considering what she's been through, she'd be a little less shallow than that. \"Me. Turning into Alberta. Her...and all the other female guardians. They're all leathery and stuff. Fighting and training and always being outdoors - they aren't pretty anymore.\" I paused.\"This...this life. It destroys them. Their looks, I mean.\" But forget her vanity for a second. Let's take a look at her apparently \"redeeming\" characteristic; her loyalty to her best friend, Lissa. You know, the one whose relationship she sabotaged? \"Why don't you just leave her alone? Are you so messed up and desperate for attention that you can't tell when someone doesn't like you?\" He scowled. \"You're some crazy stalker, and she knows it. She's told me all about your weird obsession-how you're always hanging out in the attic together, how you set Ralf on fire to impress her. She thinks you're a freak, but she's too nice to say anything.\" ...and for no other reason than jealousy. Oh, and because this dude comes from a shamed family. Never mind how much her best friend obviously adores him. Never mind how much he obviously cares about her in return. All in all, I just couldn't sympathize for Rose. She was an attempt of a kick-ass, independent, empowered young girl - but she came across as conceited, hypocritical, and shallow. Then the princess girl? Lissa? I don't know ... she was just bland. None of the characters in the book stood out for me. Even the romance seemed kind of forced (not to mention predictable - but aren't they all?!). It seemed the only reason Dimitri and Rose had this vibe going on was because of their mutual hotness (a word frequently thrown out there in the book). There was this brief explanation of how it was also because of their shared extreme dedication in being guardians - which I didn't buy. I have an extreme dedication in journalism, but I don't fall in love with every dedicated journalists out there. Plot-wise ... meh. Nothing special. The story was about a vampire and her half-human, half-vampire guardian, who had run away from a \"vampire academy\" and at the beginning of the book were captured and returned. The secret behind their escape was obviously a device to keep us hooked, but when it was finally revealed, it didn't seem too \"wow, omigod\" for me. The Vampires in this story didn't even seem like your traditional vampires, other than their weakness when exposed to direct sunlight, and their occasional \"feeding\". There was apparently another type of Vampire, which were called the \"strigoi\", which we didn't see much of; and even when we did, it wasn't even that exciting. Editing-wise ... could be better. \"describrd\" on page 142 is one of the errors that I remembered. There were more, but I can't be bothered flipping through the pages to find them. In conclusion. Maybe I would've liked this better if I were... 15? 16? But then again, maybe not.

Addition : Why I think you should read VA instead of Covenant The before : September 2010 I was a stubborn brat when it came to reading Vampire Academy. Part of me honestly thought that a vampire series couldn't impress me after experiencing how oversaturated the genre had become with depressing and lackluster characters and stories. Because of this, I went into my first read of VA begrudgingly and with a bad attitude. It didn't make any sense to me why so many people were rabid fans of this series. I think I pre-programmed myself to want to hate the books. So I read the first book and ended up liking it. But I still didn't see what the big deal was. My review reflected the attitude that it was an easy read and somewhat entertaining - but what was the big deal? Apparently, there must have been something sparked because I started book 2 shortly thereafter and then found myself blazing through the rest of the series, getting more and more addicted with each book. The After : September 2012 Two years later and this remains one of my favorite series of all time. Even though book 1 had a few glaring errors, each book got better by massive leaps and bounds. The end of book 3 had me crying, the second half of book 4 had me on pins and needles, and after I finished book 5 I joined the crew of people who were throwing out theories about what could possibly happen in the upcoming release of book 6. Since then, I've devoured the graphic novels and spinoff series Bloodlines (featuring a cast of extras from the original VA books). I had become obsessed. Dimitri is one of my all-time favorite heroes. Period. There is no one I've come across in my book reading history quite like Guardian Belikov. He is bad-ass and lethal. He is loyal and honorable. He is strong, vigilant, and protective. He is the man you want to take home to momma before dragging him off to bed (he is 24 and all man, so I do not feel guilty about admitting this!). He is every characteristic that I'd want to see in a hero, without being turned into an arrogant and controlling asshole like you see in so many books featuring a larger-than-life male lead. Rose is one of my all-time favorite female leads. What? Both the male and female in the same story are great? She is mouthy, stubborn, determined, loyal, brave, and can also kick major ass. If you ever wanted a friend who would go to bat for you, Rose is your girl. Rarely, does a couple balance one another in a story. Now, this isn't to say that these two are an actual couple (I will neither confirm nor deny that they end up together, since another potential love interest does enter the picture in book 2), but the chemistry between Roza and Dimka is off the charts because they are able to challenge each other. Oh, but wait. There's a complication. Rose is being trained to become a guardian by Dimitri. That's right - they are teacher and student. Now, this isn't in the disgustingly creepy pedo way. Rose is almost 18 and Dimitri is 24. Their values and ways of thinking often show them more as equals than mentor and student, so the lines become blurred. But yes...this has the potential to become a forbidden and dangerous love story...if they ever allowed it go there. I'm not telling, of course! Final analysis from then to now : My first read complaints were that I didn't understand why Rose was so down for the cause and had such unfailing devotion to the ruling class. Even after going through a complete series read, I still struggle with this, even though I liked some of the attitude shifts in the later books. Lissa didn't impress me back in 2010. She still doesn't impress me in 2012. I didn't recall book 1 having so much silly teen drama. Because books 3 through 6 are focused so much on fighting and real-life struggles outside of the school, those are the memories I carry with me. This is an extremely mature (and sexy) series for YA because of the older characters and content. So I was surprised to go back and realize that book 1 read younger and sillier than the rest of the books. It was still good. In fact, I appreciate it more now, knowing how much it set up the series, so I'm raising my rating a full star. Make no mistake though, this is the weakest book in the series. If you're unsure about book 1, keep reading because it gets INCREDIBLE from here on out. The world building in the first 30% of the original book was overwhelming imo. Initial info-dumping is one of Mead's only flaws as a writer because otherwise she is a master at getting me to care about her characters (regardless of series). The action and adventure balances the romance excellently. I should have mentioned this earlier, but this is not a paranormal romance series. It is a high-octane Urban Fantasy. Expect adventures in every book. The sexual chemistry is just a bonus, but it doesn't choke out the fun aspect of the series. I have no doubt now that this will stay in my top 3 series for a long time to come. Re-reading only cemented this for me. Oh my Dimka, my Dimka... Dimitri hovered over us, alert and ready for any threat, his body coiled to attack. I felt safe with him beside us. In that horrible moment, with him raging like a storm, I knew why Mason had called him a god. He regarded me with utter seriousness, like he always did. \"I think you're beautiful.\" \"Beautiful?\" \"You are so beautiful, it hurts me sometimes.\" ...more Vampire Academy is a difficult book to review. On one hand, it is a variation on the norm and Rose is definitely not the usual character occupying the myriad of PRNs these days. The writing style is blessedly free of awkward construction and mistakes. In fact, the writing isn't too bad at all. The secondary characterizations are quite good for the most part, and well rounded. The pacing is agonizingly slow at the beginning of the book and doesn't pick up until the last fifty pages. The lore behind Vampire Academy is a difficult book to review. On one hand, it is a variation on the norm and Rose is definitely not the usual character occupying the myriad of PRNs these days. The writing style is blessedly free of awkward construction and mistakes. In fact, the writing isn't too bad at all. The secondary characterizations are quite good for the most part, and well rounded. The pacing is agonizingly slow at the beginning of the book and doesn't pick up until the last fifty pages. The lore behind the story is complex, convoluted and somewhat ridiculous. So you have the Moroi's, a race of weak, magic wielding vampires and the Dhampires who are their stronger \"Guardians\". The only way that Dhampires breed is if they are lucky enough to get up to shenanigans with the Moroi (who won't marry them) and have illegitimate bastard children. However this is somehow okay for this race because they can't breed amongst themselves and if you're a Dhampire male than you can just give up on the idea of ever having children because extreme chances are that you won't. The Dhamires are the Moroi's Guardians against another race of vampires, the Strogoi, who want to feast on Moroi flesh. But you'd think that, on behalf of your race, if you were a Dhampire and naturally stronger and tougher then these Moroi - you'd just conquer them and keep them as your slaves. Who wants to dedicate their lives (their entire lives - they literally LIVE to protect the Moroi) just for the faint chance of being able to reproduce? Especially with a race that looks down on you! It just doesn't make sense and the dynamics don't really compute. I mean, okay, I'm not the most ethical person out there but if I were a stronger, tougher breed of vampire and the weak vampires came and said, \"Okay, we'll keep you as our Guardians and have drunken, disrespectful sex with you on occasion as long as you protect us from the Strogoi.\" I'd probably respond with, \"How about I protect you by keeping you in my dank, dark cellar as my slave while I take over the world? Does that sound fair to you?\" It's just the way nature works FFS! The pay off isn't anywhere near the sacrifice! Guardian women either have to give up their children or quit, have no income and become a \"blood whore\" (those that feed the Moroi - something that's looked down upon as beyond disgusting). I'm sorry. I vote for overthrowing the weak, pissy Moroi and ruling over them as tyrants. It definitely would be a more feasible option with less likelihood of me ending up screwed over. The love story surprised me. I spent the entire book up until the last few pages thinking it was extremely gross, if not weird and awkward. I didn't and I still don't feel any chemistry between the main two love interests. They seem to be thrown together by the author with nothing real between them to make you think that they actually belong together. The last part of the book redeemed a lot of that for me though with the encouraging decisions made by the male romantic lead. Over all, it's not a bad read if you're into teenage romances and school stories. The School aspect plays a major role in this book, particularly the politics of the average teen life. For those who were immensely glad to leave high school behind, this book may not be for you. ...more ____________________________________________ \u201cOnly a true best friend can protect you from your immortal enemies.\u201d ____________________________________________ You can find the full review and more about this book on my blog!

The action was short,like ultimately short. The scene with psi hounds and Victor,I imagined a world war fight,but what I got was two persons fighting dogs. 3. Rose's dumbness.

I also liked the jokes.T here were some burns that I even felt while reading.Rose sure has a lot of tongue.And I have to admit,it was fun to read. 3.

Vampire. Saga. EVER. Just that. I dare anyone come and tell me otherwise. It is funny, witty, the plots are amazing, and the characters are great (well.... maybe Lissa is not great, but hey, she is just the one flaw). If you like vampire books, you must read it. If you hate vampire books, you must read it. What the hell, whether you like or dislike books in general, this book is a MUST HAVE.

I mean, what do you do when you've nothing ahead of you but a day at the library and when you turn around...dum, dum, dum... there it is, the internationally praised series that you swore you would never... but then what if you felt different?... how can you expect to deal with not finding out for yourself?

So I guess I'm going to be the whole 'curiosity killed the cat' cliche when I get past book 3, not to mention the one about being a 'glutton for punishment'. But, as I've been told and as I therefore expected, this first book in the series I've been putting off was really good. I'm not surprised I liked the writing style seeing as I'm already a Richelle Mead fan after reading her Succubus series . She uses traditional urban fantasy features like supernatural creatures and mythology but has a very chick-lit feel to her books which I like. My favourite hobby is to read about spunky, sarcastic heroines who aren't afraid to express their sexuality. I expected Mead to be somewhat more vanilla in a young adult novel but she (not surprisingly) pushed the boundaries and made this quite a sexy novel. It's basically the vampire version of high school, complete with bitchiness, cliques and hot but obnoxious guys. I also found it one of the best depictions of friendship between two teenage girls that I've read in a long time, Rose and Lissa are simply delightful characters. It did make me really want to read book 2 but I will be progressing with caution throughout. I couldn't help myself, I've been warned countless times and read reviews that talk about Mead's later failures with this series, but I still had to find out for myself. I'm annoying like that. ...more I decided to read Vampire Academy because it was on a list of books most likely to inherit Twilight's throne ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-an... ) .

Before I harp on about the first Vampire Academy book, I want to comment on the series as a whole: these books are really readable and quite good fun. They pull fewer punches than a lot of other supernatural novels, and the series gets quite a bit darker as it progresses. The characters encounter myriad trials--mental instability, torture, betrayal, death, and (of course) true love. The primary protagonist, Rose, is especially strong; she is tough, quick-tempered, but very clever with a great sense of humor (and she develops a depth and sadness as the series progresses). Best of all, I think that most of the books in the series are consistent, building effectively on one another--something I can't say for most sagas. I wish the characters were allowed to change and deepen a little more in light of certain traumatic events throughout the series (though to be fair, I think the whole aftereffect of traumatic events is explored more thoroughly in the spin-off series, Bloodlines). I find the dialogue weirdly wooden and would prefer a little more subtext in it (especially for the lest direct, more socially graceful characters like Lissa; Rose is obviously the kind of person who says what she thinks, come hell or high water!) Nonetheless, the books are absorbing, probably my favourite YA vampire novels currently on the market. Now on to a bit about the first book itself: The first book in a series of six, Vampire Academy reads like a combination of Twilight, Gossip Girl, and one of Tamora Pierce's Alanna novels. The heady mixture of vicious gossip, the supernatural, and adolescent sexuality (there's all kinds of making out) creates something compulsively readable and fun. Sure, the reader has to cope with sentences--stuck in the midst of dead serious scenes--that read \"And then, suddenly, he was there, charging down the hallway like Death in a cowboy duster\"; sure, the character development is about as subtle as a blow to the head. And yes, it's true that the dialog is full of more dead wood than an old oak tree. None of that matters when your story is narrated by a beautiful liquorish body guard who hates books and gets slap-happy whenever anyone else so much as gives her best friend and ward--a vampire princess (yes, a vampire princess)--so much as a funny look. Did I mention that this bodyguard and her princess share a psychic bond? That our tough narrator has a crush on her sexy Russian mentor (who quite obviously fancies her as well)? That all of the other vampire royals are full of malice and gossip? That the vampire princess has special powers? How about a war between \"good\" and \"bad\" vampires? Oh reader, this book is good fun. ...more This book was totally wicked! I \u2665 it!!! :P I hope you can feel my joy for reading this book once you have read it too! It was awesome! I loved how you got totally engrossed in it and then it had a total shocker ending! But, I'm not telling you what that is! :P I finally decided to bite the bullet and pick this series up. I'll be honest, I did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did! So easy to read and Rose was a spunky, outspoken heroine and I love that Richelle Mead wasn't afraid to make Rose so sexually confident and confident in herself too. It was SO REFRESHING Full review to come (maybe.) Vampire Academy is a series I am very familar with. This was a re-read for me considering I have basically been reading these books every year since I was 13 (meaning six years). Coming back to this series is like a warm hug as every character is familar, the plot is familar, the tone is familar. I was glad this re-read was successful as a lot of re-reads I have done this year have left me disappointed. Vampire Academy is a well-known series, whether becasue the covers are ugly or because of the Vampire Academy is a series I am very familar with. This was a re-read for me considering I have basically been reading these books every year since I was 13 (meaning six years). Coming back to this series is like a warm hug as every character is familar, the plot is familar, the tone is familar. I was glad this re-read was successful as a lot of re-reads I have done this year have left me disappointed. Vampire Academy is a well-known series, whether becasue the covers are ugly or because of the kickass characters or the movie flop I don't know . This series, however, displays some kickass female characters and some kickass female friendships (which, how often do you really see in YA?) I won't even try to summarise the story because I'll probably accidentally throw spoilers in, I just recommend picking up this series. Ignore the ugly covers. Pick it up . As a warning this review will be short for two reasons. 1 - it's hard to express my feelings in words about this series so I will probably just use gifs. 2 - I am being barked at in the face right now as I type this out. Also, I am using gifs from the Vampire Academy movie, but that does not mean I really enjoyed said movie. Characters Rose Oh Rose, our kickass female main character. I could go on forever about Rose. About how absolutely empowering it is to have a female character who can and will kickass. I mean she's not perfect, she slut shames constantly and is a hypocrite in some aspects. But, she's a smart ass who will give a lashing to anyone who gives her crap and her main goal is to protect her best friend, Lissa. Rose is a Dhampir, which is basically someone who is half Moroi (vampire) and half human. She is one of the few females training to become someone who protects the Moroi, the rest labeled \"blood whores\" - most commonly so by Rose. I really enjoyed watching Rose train throughout the book and get her strength back, watching the devlopment she has from reckless teenager to dedicated warrior. Dimitri Dimitri is another Dhampir, someone who is an official Guardian (meaning he protects the Moroi as a career). I'll be the first to admit I'm not a Dimitri fan. I don't like him. At all. I find him creepy, unprofessional and slightly unnerving. He is painted to be a God. To be the best Guardian there is, basically. However, I found his stoic response a lot of the time an asshole move that had me rolling my eyes a lot of the book (and every time I read it). I also get slightly unnerved over his feelings for Rose, it is the student-teacher relationship that has me cringing at the pure idea their relationship. Now, thats not to say I don't ship Rose and Dimitri. I do, I love their progression through the novels and as I re-read this series I think that will become obvious throughout my reviews. It is, however, just the introduction of Dimitri that rubs me the wrong way every time I re-read this series. Christian Christian is a Moroi who has the affinity over fire, and is one of my favourite characters in this series. He rivals Rose in every way and the pair of them are absolutely hilarious when they are interacting. I always get a good laugh from the banter exchanged from the pair of them throughout Vampire Academy . I can't say too much more about his character, however, without spoiling what happens in this particular book. I mean, I may be able to, but I don't really want to. Lissa Lissa is another Moroi, and Rose's absolute best friend. The pair of them have been through thick and thin, which includes being in the car crash which murdered Lissa's entire family. Due to this experience, or so it's hinted at, the pair of them have a bond. Now, I don't mean they've connected through the loss of people close to them. No. I mean, Rose can literally feel what Lissa is feeling. It is a big strange, yes, but the more we see it through Rose's perspective the more interesting it really gets. Lissa is an incredibly complex character, she has never developed a particular skill over one of the elements like Moroi are supposed to. She struggles with who she is and she has a stronger compulsion over people than others of her kind. Her progression, downfall, and rise throughout the book are incredible to watch and it only gets more intense the further along you get in the books. World-Building The world-building in the book is incredibly easy to follow. It is set in modern society with a few twists to place the paranormal creatures. Rose also explains what each word means, which doesn't leave you confused and struggling to grasp what a \"Moroi\" is. Plot The plot? Writing Mead draws you in with her easy writing style, it's easy to fall in love with and easy to follow the story as it progresses. It's creative, of course, but it isn't complicated in the way you have to fully stop reading to understand the joke that is being made to you. She is also amazing at foreshadowing. Overall Overall, if I can continue to love this book after six years of re-reads I think I am highly advised to tell you to pick it up. ...more Dear Vampire Diary, wait, why did I write that? \"vampire\" diary? maybe cause everything in my life is vampire, vampire, vampire! best friend vampire. training to protect vampires. actually protecting vampires.

I wish I could talk to Dimitri instead. Rose \u2741 Dear Vampire Diary, ok, let's try this again. just came back from a great workout with Dimitri and I need someplace to vent. hello, diary. I'm not really a diary sort of girl, whatever that even means. that's probably more of a vampire type thing, thinking about life, deep thoughts, writing it down, all that. deep. deep and not exciting. but I need someplace to put all these dimitris thoughts. whoah! ok, I guess I need someplace to put all my thoughts about Dimitri. those eyes! that voice! the body! shoulder length hair! now I know that shoulder length hair on guys is a total romantic clich\u00e9 but whatever. I love that shoulder length hair. oh, Dimitri! Dimitri. ok, enough about Dimitri. I should talk about more important things like my training and my best friend Lissa and all the plots swirling around her and stupid school cliques and my hectic schedule and what I learned in dimitri today. what I learned in class today! it was something about - uh - hmmm - I don't know. honestly I was thinking about Dimitri the whole time. ok I think I need to take care of some business here because I'm feeling sorta frustrated and I can't get Dimitri out of my dimitri. Rose \u2741 Dear Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead, there, that feels better. who needs a stupid diary when I can just write to the story of my so-called life. it's not like anyone's going to read this, they can just read the book. so anyway... I want to thank you, Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead. you really got it right. sure you put a lot in about Dimitri and his hair but all that stuff really wasn't the point and you know that. first of all, I want to say how much I just plain LIKED the story you made of my life. it was fun to read! and exciting. you kept some of the boring parts, sure, whose life is all excitement, but mainly it was fun from beginning to end. ok, that's all I want to say about the fun. you made it fun, thank you, but fun is not everything. what really counts for me is that you did not gloss over the things that were uncomfortable and deep and sometimes even ugly. you got the addictive part right, the blood sucking, how it is like a drug or like sex and how much I want to do that drug-sex thing (or actually how much I want Lissa to do it to me). and getting bitten feels so good, so incredible, damn how it makes me feel! but I can't admit it. I don't want to admit it to myself and I especially don't want to admit how much I like it to other people, they'll think I'm some junkie or some slut or whatever, and if I think too hard about it, I'll probably think the same thing about myself. so yeah, you got that right, Vampire Academy. the self-loathing that comes with feeling good about doing something bad. but is it so bad? I like how you left that ambiguous. you left Lissa's cutting in. I love you for that. you made sense of the cutting and why she did it. you didn't dismiss it, didn't shy away from it, and you didn't make it pathetic. you made your readers understand cutting in an honest and real way. here's another thing you got right: my pettiness and my hypocrisy. I used the same disgusting tactics of gossip and shaming - both slut-shaming and shaming around status & class - on the people who used it on me. you didn't leave that out. you didn't excuse it. you showed how I was sometimes just as bad as the villains in the book. you didn't justify how low Lissa and I went in trying to defend ourselves, how we became just as terrible as the people who were tormenting us. that was hard for me to read. and it was important for me to read too. but the most important thing you got right was the central relationship. you are not about me and my thing for Dimitri. you are about friendship between women . you are about two best friends, me and Lissa, everything else is secondary. that's the point of your whole story. sisterhood! that feels corny to write but whatever. it's true. your story is moving because it is about how girls can bond and protect each other and hurt together and move forward together. how they can understand each other. thank you for getting all of that right. so in case you're wondering, I gave you 3 stars instead of 4 and that's because the writing was kinda bland and the second half got a little bogged down in DimitriDimitriDimitri. but so what! nobody's perfect (except Dimitri). I will still read your sequels. Rose \u2741 Dear mark monday, Stop pretending to be Rose. Richelle Mead ...more This is a negative review. If you enjoyed the book, that's great!

But at least we have what seems like a kick-ass main character, Rose, and a strong female friendship between her and Lisa, so I was like: Then a mildly interesting premise suddenly turns into high school drama and terrible writing, so I was like: Things keep getting worse, because Rose is acting like the spoiled thirteen-year-old we've all been (despite her being what, seventeen?), thinking she's tough shit and that insulting authority figures, being rude and punching people in the face whenever they disagree with her is the best course of action. So, while trying really hard to be a badass, she ends up looking like an immature brat, and I was like: By this point I had almost forgotten about the whole vampire thing, because the book was basically a cheaper version of Mean Girls, with a lot of slut-shaming, girl-on-girl hate and most characters just being juvenile and stupid, so I was like: But then I thought, come on Jun, there must be a reason why so many people love this book... You can't give up just yet! because, apparently, I really hate myself. A lot of nonsensical things happened: dead animals started to turn up everywhere, Rose was more annoying than ever, some high school hierarchy bullshit, more girl-on-girl hate, a boring love interest that treated Rose like a misbehaving child (which she was, but I still wanted to slap him for it)... and by then I was about to fall asleep. Enter a rushed and underwhelming ending, and boring characters being more boring than usual. On top of stupidity, internalized sexism and a plot that consisted solely on young girls hating on each other, and on boys calling them names and being generally awful, add some horrible writing and a fucking weird pacing that made me want to DNF the book at least every two pages. The hype is A LIAR. I will not be continuing this series. ...more 4.5 stars. Why did I avoid this book like the plague?

I don\u2019t mind revenge, in fact, I love that shit!, but this was just senseless hate\u2026. ALL OVER THE DAMN PLACE!! And guess what\u2026 the worst culprit in my girl-on-girl hate onslaught was over a boy. OF COURSE IT WAS!! Because, apparently, girls CANNOT ever be angry about anything not related to a boy\u2026. NOPE! We are merely flesh machines designed to pump out babies and cater to a man\u2019s every whim, aren\u2019t we?! Slut Shaming: I won\u2019t go into any spoiltastic details but I will say that our MC is promiscuous AND extremely flirty. I would be completely fine with this IF it didn\u2019t create a HUGE plot element of slut-shaming craziness! THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH ENJOYING YOUR SEXUALITY!!! Side note: I though Rose was gay for about half of this book AND I am still not entirely convinced she isn't. (Which I have no issue with BUT I think Mead wrote her and Lissa's friendship bizarrely if she didn't intend this avenue.) Inappropriate Love Interest: I don\u2019t think I need to elaborate on how bad of a decision it is to have a love interest that is SEVEN years older than our 17-year-old MC, do I?! And although, ultimately, this was handled as well as I can imagine I just don\u2019t like it. YUCK! I have known scores of high schoolers with crushes on their teachers\u2026. BUT I can\u2019t help but feel that (view spoiler) [ a 24 year old who has a crush on a 17 year old is pretty emotionally unhinged!! It made me question one of the only characters I enjoyed in this story. (hide spoiler) ] TSTL Main Characters: There was really no plot, for me, in this book. I guessed EVERYTHING very early on. And while I will give allowances for teenager\u2019s self-involvement I felt cheated by characters that couldn\u2019t see beyond their own asses! There are a few others, as well, but I think these four encapsulate my feelings pretty well. My Happy Places: The Social Hierarchy: Initially I didn\u2019t like the way the Royals, dhampires, Moroi and Strigoi played out BUT I have to admit that once I got my head around \"dead vampires\" and \"living vampires\" I found it a bold and interesting premise. And while the Royalty annoyed me it did have a fundamental purpose, overall. The Guardians: I LOVE the idea of Vampires having protectors! I loved the hard work and dedication that went into it. I enjoyed Dimitri\u2019s loyalty to the cause despite a truly moving revelation given about his mother and his upbringing. This moment endeared me to him quite a bit! I forgot to mention ABOVE how much I despise the terms \"feeders\" and \"blood-whores\"... YUCK! Christian: I adored Christian. His moral ambiguity, his lonerness\u2026. I may read book two for Christian alone. I loved that he was the one character intelligent enough to put everything I guessed together\u2026.. but that he was so overlooked that no one would ask him. Thus they fluttered around like idiots while Christian was over in the enlightened square going all \"Guys?! Ummmm guys?!?!\" Those crystal-blue eyes went unfocused. \"It was like seeing an army of Death invade my house\" In closing, my final words are: [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more 6 stars!

Wow and double wow, this book was a brilliant introduction to the \u201cVampire Academy\u201d series and after I had read this book, I really wanted to read more about these awesome characters! Full of drama, mystery, action and hot romance, \u201cVampire Academy\u201d is definitely one novel that will take the paranormal world by storm! For two years, Rose Hathaway and Vasilisa \u201cLissa\u201d Dragomir, escaped from St. Vladimir\u2019s Academy to go into hiding, but they were soon discovered by the school\u2019s guardians and were brought back to the academy. Little does anyone know Rose took her best friend Lissa out of the academy because there was a great danger being posed against Lissa and only Rose can protect her from the forces of evil. Now, should I give this book a six star rating? Yes, definitely yes! This novel is clearly the one that defines what a true paranormal romance is all about and I am so glad that all my friends had recommended me this book! Richelle Mead\u2019s writing is extremely and unbelievably amazing as it is full of action and adventure and I loved the sort of mature \u201cHarry Potter\u201d spin on this story as both stories involve the main characters going to a magical school. I also loved the way that the plot never once slows down and the story keeps getting more exciting as the story went on and that was what I loved about the writing. The way that Richelle Mead made this story being told from Rose\u2019s point of view on the events that unfold at the academy was truly remarkable and hilarious at the same time as we know how Rose really feels about the situations around her and I loved hearing her inner thoughts on various people at school as some of them are really hilarious, such as thinking of many ways to beat up the school bully Mia. I really loved the world that Rose and her friends live in as they all go to a school for vampires or more specifically, a school for Dhampir and Moroi students and that really brings out the creativity in this novel. Now, my favorite part of the book were the characters as they were all interesting, but the two characters in this book that were my favorites were Rose Hathaway and Russian guardian, Dimitri Belikov. Rose Hathaway was such an awesome heroine because she is extremely brave and independent and even though I sometimes found her hot temper to be a little annoying at times, it is because she tries to protect her best friend Lissa from danger. That is another aspect that I loved about Rose because she is always willing to put her life on the line to keep her friend Lissa safe and that just proves what a true friend Rose is. I also loved how Rose always provides humor for the story as she is always making wisecracks about the situations around her and I especially loved her inner thoughts on taking care of the school bullies, which unfortunately involves her beating them up. Now onto the hero and that is Dimitri Belikov! Dimitri was one hero that is so hot and awesome at the same time and I loved the scenes of him fighting off anyone who tries to harm Rose! I also loved the mysterious and dark attitude that he seems to give off towards everyone around him, but he also has a heart of gold and I loved the moments where he smiles at Rose and shows genuine concern for her safety. It just makes me feel so tingly inside every time he shows kindness towards Rose! As for Dimitri and Rose\u2019s relationship, it is kind of unknown to me at this point about where they stand, but there are still some pretty heartwarming and sexy moments between these two that I will definitely keep an eye out for! Surprisingly, there is a strong amount of language and violence in this book and anyone who does not like reading strong language might want to skip over them. Also, the violence in this book is pretty graphic as there is gore aplenty in this book, so that might be something that anyone who is not a big fan of graphic violence might want to check over. Overall, \u201cVampire Academy\u201d is definitely one paranormal book that every paranormal romance fan will read over and over again! Did this novel help me get more into the series? You bet it did and now I\u2019m going to read the second book in the series, \u201cFrostbite.\u201d Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog ...more 2.5 stars Ehhhhhhh It took quite a few chapters for me to get into this one, and even then it was pretty easy to put down.

I was expecting something a little more 'young' adult (along the lines of the House of Night series) but instead the characters are all quite mature. The book itself is written with more of a mature tone than other YA books I have read, and I much prefer this style of writing. I think it helped that one of the characters was twenty-four years old. There are two types of vampir *may contain spoilers* What a great first book to a series - I really enjoyed this, I couldn't put it down it was so good.

The book itself is written with more of a mature tone than other YA books I have read, and I much prefer this style of writing. I think it helped that one of the characters was twenty-four years old. There are two types of vampire; the Moroi who are 'good' vampires and who are alive. They have the ability to use magic, wielding the four elements of air, water, earth and fire. The other type is a Strigoi, these are evil and although both types need blood, Strigoi kill while taking it.There are also Dhampirs who are half Moroi and half human. They don't need to drink blood to survive but because they have faster and better reflexes than the Moroi are instead trained as their Guardians. The academy is where the Guardians train, graduate and get assigned to a Moroi to protect. 'Vampire Academy' begins outside of the school with Rose, the main protagonist, and her best friend, Lissa, who are on the run. Something happened at the academy that frightened them both and so they decided to run away. Unfortunately they are being hunted and have to keep moving, until one night they are captured by the academy's guardians and brought back to the school. This is the first time Rose meets Guardian Dimitri Belikov. There's an instant attraction between them and it's this relationship that makes the book great for me. Surprisingly, I also liked every single character. It's quite unusual for me to like every character but in Vampire Academy I did. Even those that are annoying and hateful I still enjoyed reading about. Rose is conceited and somewhat arrogant at times, but I didn't mind. Although she thought she was hot and boys were 'crazy' about her, she's also very loyal, bold and feisty. I thought she brought a great sense of courage and determination to her character. Rose is a guardian in training and is hoping to be Lissa's guardian when she graduates. What I also liked about this book is it showed the Guardians in training. I liked that it didn't shy away from the fact that Dhampirs aren't as strong or as quick as Strigoi. We get to see how much Rose has to train to be strong, fast and quick-thinking. She spends hours each day honing her craft, which is where she falls for Dimitri - and who wouldn't! Dimitri is swoon worthy. I love his character and I also like the fact that he's in his twenties, which means he shows a lot of maturity instead of the typical school boy hangups I find so tedious sometimes in young adult literature. I can understand why Rose succumbs as Damitri is a Guardian too, but stoically so. He is nicknamed 'the God' and he shows why in everything he does. He becomes her role model as well her friend. Rose's crush on him grows into something much more and she knows he feels the same way, but there are many factors, as well as age, that keeps them apart. Rose's friend, Lissa is a lovely character. She's a Moroi Princess and is very sweet natured. She relies heavily on Rose to protect her. Lissa also has the ability to heal, and when she brought Rose back from the dead after a fatal accident they are now bonded. This means that Rose can feel all the emotions of Lissa - unfortunately it's only one way. But because of this their friendship is deep and meaningful. The other characters are also just as well-written and perfectly well rounded and the story itself kept my interest from beginning to end. It's fast paced and exciting and the climax at the end I really didn't see coming (and that doesn't happen very often). VERDICT: 'Vampire Academy' is one of the best young adult books in the paranormal genre I've read. There are strong female characters and a great storyline with a plot that is immensely intriguing. I would highly recommend this book to all paranormal fans in a heart-beat. Why it took me so long to start this series I don't know, but I'm so glad I've started it now.

I feel mildly ashamed for recommending these books to so many people now. So I am updating this review to make up for my past sin of promoting this series. If you are curious what Vampire Academy buzz is all about, check it out at your own risk. First three books are quite good, written with care, love and respect for readers. Everything after brings embarrassment to the author's name. It is nothing more than cheap lifeless melodrama mixed with equally cheap action and poor characterization. I am reducing all my VA rating by 1 star, just 'cause... Original review This series was recommended to me by those readers who were extremely disappointed by the ending of the Twilight Saga (Breaking Dawn) and I am grateful for this recommendation. This vampire series has everything: action, love, friendship, great mythology. This first books starts a little slow, but soon becomes very engaging, and the 3rd book in the series is just fantastic! ...more I've made it my mission to finish this series once and for all, but three years can do a lot to one's goldfish-like memory- and so a re-read is in order! ~ Review: Over the past few months, I'd only ever heard good things about Vampire Academy and me putting it off for this long was only due to my bloody skills at procrastination.

Richelle Mead, you've just bitch-slapped and walked over every other young adult vampire book out there in all your whip-smart, butt-kicking glory for me with this one! And if you haven't for anyone else who's read this too- well, then they've got another thing coming. It's been so very long since I've read a well-written paranormal novel with a remarkable set of characters and a fierce female protagonist. Rose Hathaway sure as hell isn't one to take shit from nobody and she's easy enough to like right from the start. The story takes off with Rose, who's the guardian of her best friend Lissa, a Moroi (they're the good, mortal vampires). Richelle beautifully portrays the strong loyalty and protectiveness the two feel for each other and she keeps up with it till the very end. The aspect of them being Blood Sisters and the deep bond they share has definitely got to be one of the best parts of the story. Had me remembering the reasons I dearly loved Supernatural so much too with the Winchesters. Before I'd given Vampire Academy a shot, I was worried about falling into a pit of hopeless, cringe-worthy romance with no meaning and soul, topped with the incessantly overdone vampire plotline; and Merlin knows I don't want in on that. While reading Vampire Academy , I'd initially held a slight annoyance towards Lissa's character; seeing as I'm still recovering from post-season 3-Game of Thrones trauma, I couldn't help but compare her and Rose to Sansa and Arya respectively. Where Rose is this mother of all that is badass on one side, it makes Lissa seem weak and frail and too freaking dependent for my taste next to her. After completing Vampire Academy , I hold a hell of a lot respect for both the author and Liss, because though she may not have 'kick-ass queen of sass' as her middle name, she's brave and headstrong in a wholly different way and as you progress with the story, you begin to admire her for it. Not to mention, the secret fangirlier side of me couldn't help but internally squeal in anticipation every time she interacted with Christian. The moment Mr. Ozera stepped into the premise, I was inevitably swept off my feet. Funny, because I was expecting that to happen for me with our male lead, Dimitri Belikov here. Yes folks, we're finally talking about him. But I'm terrified of the obsessive fans lurking about, waiting to slit my throat after what I say. Because I never did get attached to him. Not really. This is going a bit off track, but just last month there was this face-off poll I came across between Will Herondale (ahem, my one but most certainly not only love) and Dimitri Belikov. And the latter had taken the prize with nearly thirty thousand votes or so- and not only did he have Will beat, but every other swoon worthy male character within the realms of YA fiction! So of course, I was curious to find what awesomeness lay in store for me. But as much as it sucks to say this, I was left a wee bit disappointed. And I don't even know why; maybe it's because the hair constantly bothered me (okay no, I'm just kidding) or how old he was, or the fact that he doesn't really have all that many scenes in the book when you think about it. I wish I could've understood his personality more in depth but in a pleasantly realistic fashion, Rose doesn't manage to quite reach that point of intimacy with her combat mentor over the span of a mere two months, besides a feeling of almost-deep attraction. And I'm glad it's that way, because it meant the storyline didn't revolve around their frustrating romance (ah yes, because there just always have to be so many complications and UST for us sheets-clawing-head-banging readers to deal with it- yet enjoy all the same). Near the end, I'll admit I was worried Dimitri would go down the 'im-going-to-turn-into-the-ultimate-prick-and-pretend-i-hate-you-for-the-greater-good' road but THANK MERCIFUL HEAVENS that never happens. Despite my initial indifference to Rose's budding feelings for him (because come on now, isn't that the best part when it comes to romance? Falling head over heels right along with the girl as you go ride your merry way to happy-endings la la land. At least, I hope it's going to be a happy ending. Oh shite, I'm scared now.) I did grow accustomed to their growing relationship and better yet, I've got FIVE MORE BOOKS to devour and see where this goes. True, much of the first half and some parts later on seemed to focus a lot on the usual high school drama side of it (with it's own fantasy twist), but this Mean Girls-esque subplot still had me interested the whole time. And to make up for it, the second half picks up even more of a quick pace and dives right into the fun action bits. After this thoroughly enjoyable journey, one thing's for certain: Mead isn't one to leave you uninterested or bored and- I'm excited. Quite a lot.

She was still realistic with her emotions and her flaws which made her even better. My reaction when reading and getting to know her: The romance . Rose and Dmitri Belikov are are a great couple but I don't want to share too much and risk giving out some spoilers that you guys probably don't want to know about. There were few things that I disliked about this book but there is one that comes to mind. At times, there just seemed to be unneeded-for lack of a better word-description. I would find myself skimming over it to get to more interesting parts or whatever comes next. All in all, that was a great book and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was on the fence about it since its not your typical vampire book *cough cough* Twilight. ...more This book is exactly as it sounds, high school with vampires. It was lots of fun though! I hear the next two books are the best in the series, I'll have to get them soon! WOW. I was so not prepared for this book to be so good. I'm not a friend of vampires (even though I loved Twilight) so I had my doubts. This book just blew my mind right away! I couldn't stop reading, I just kept on turning pages and repeated to myself like a million times \"just one more chapter...\" So if you are like me, DO NOT HESITATE TO PICK THIS BOOK UP. Give it a try! This was amazing and deserves easily 5 stars. I loved the characters. Even though I didn't really feel them, I just loved h WOW. I was so not prepared for this book to be so good.

Oh, and by the way, I'M ALL IN FOR DIMITRI AND ROSE. The moment they met, I sold my soul. There were A LOT twists and weird things, but they kept this book interesting. Some of them were a little predictable but in the end I was just like WHAT THE F IS HAPPENING?! This book was also HILARIOUS. I laughed almost in every chapter or at least smiled. I really needed this kind of book in my life because all the books I've recently read have been quite sad. I don't know what to write to the spoilery section, so this time this whole review will not consist of any spoilers. All in all, 5/5 GO READ THIS. *throws the book at you* ...more If I had to describe this book really shortly I would probably say: vampire teen drama .. a lot of vampire teen drama. Not that this is bad, because I enjoyed enormously the way these teens interacted with each other, the jokes, the fights, the paybacks, and so on.

Not that this is bad, because I enjoyed enormously the way these teens interacted with each other, the jokes, the fights, the paybacks, and so on. Still, I felt like this was just another usual teen book with a more commercial settling. The only thing that made me think that this was a vampire book (except for the title and the fact that the main character told me so many times that this was indeed a vampire story) was the blood feeding (and that's not really something I enjoy reading about). Most of the story is about Rose and her best friend Lissa coming back to the Academy and trying to fit in (or make the others 'fit around '), and also about their growing bond, their secrets, their powers and (mostly) their love life. I liked Rose a lot, she was one of the best female characters I've read about - not because she was strong or smart, but because she was sharply honest, and sarcastic, and she made me laugh a lot. She knew how to stand for herself and her best friend, she knew when to crack a joke and when to keep it for herself, she knew the difference between punching someone and making a point. Even though the story had a serious touch to it, Rose made me feel relaxed about her discoveries, she made me enjoy this ride and like her more and more with every page. Ignoring the fact that I didn't really get the attraction between Rose and Dimitri (not because of their age difference, but because they seemed like total opposites: she was open and funny, he was mysterious and a bit grumpy), I liked their story and I can't wait to find out more about them. Also I want to know more about Lissa and Christian - as they were cute together and they seemed to be perfect for each other. Well, I didn't really like Lissa that much, as she seemed too weak and depressed for a vampire, but Christian was a really interesting character and around him even she was a better person (or a better 'moroi' if you wish). Christian was mysterious in a totally different way, and he even made me more interested in him than the main male character, which is a bit strange, but I'm not complaining. Now, truth being told, I don't know what my expectations were. From my limited knowledge about vampires I thought they were supposed to be strong, deadly, fast, immortal, and so on... And this is so not the case. Vampires are flooding bookshops and libraries and every story has to be unique so I don't know in how many ways a vampire can be different and still interesting. I've seen shiny vampires, why would I be surprised to find about some vampires that use magic and that are protected by half human guardians, right? It didn't surprise me and I wasn't impressed either, but I'm sure that in the next books this will change, so I'll keep reading this series hoping for some more interesting adventures and discoveries about this world. Also, I have some mentions to make: Maybe I'm wrong (as I've never paid too much attention to the horror mythical creatures in my culture) but as far as I can remember I've thought that 'moroi' were similar to what you call 'zombies' (dead people coming back from the grave - without a virus making them living-dead, but nevertheless similar in the appearance and the need to kill human beings), and 'strigoi' were some sort of ghosts, the harming kind (the ones that come back to hunt the loved ones or the people that hurt them when they were alive.. and if you've read ' Anna dressed in Blood ' you'll have a pretty good idea of what kind of ghosts I'm talking about).. Off course, someone could give me a hand here and tell me if I'm misleading you, or maybe I should ask my sister as she is studying (among other things) this kind of traditional believes. This being said, in the beginning I had a bit of a hard time picturing the 'moroi' and 'strigoi' as vampires in this particular book. NOTE: I am not against the author using these concepts and changing them to match her own imagination, I was just amused and it took me a bit of time to adjust and be able to picture them as vampires. That's all!. It's an invented world, so they can be whatever the author wants them to be.

When I read it the second time my opinion of it didn't change all that much, there were equally good and bad apsects of the book.

When I read it the second time my opinion of it didn't change all that much, there were equally good and bad apsects of the book. Overall, I did think it stood out amongst the YA genre but the plot wasn't anything special other than a few surprises along the line. A lot of potential lies in the mythology- it is based on real Romanian mythology about 2 races of vampires\u2014 one bad- the Strigoi and one good- the Moroi and the human hybrids- the dhampirs who are supposed to protect the good vampires from the evil ones. The variety of races really did intrigue me because it created a whole new world that YA usually never has, the academy itself, the Moroi politics and monarchy system, another pro is the elemental magic that the Moroi possess and the \"5th element\". In terms of plot, it was mostly a flatline- the pacing was very slow in the beginning until we got some action in the last couple of chapters. However what I liked was the dark feel around it because usually what YA lacks is an atmosphere of the supernatural, other good parts were definitely but what really put me off was the amount of internal whinging, narcissism that we got from Rose Hathaway. I don't understand why people call Rose Hathaway a strong, female character- she is not one at all, just because you are a rude bitch that is able to throw a punch or do Kung Fu doesn't make you in anyway an emotionally strong person but rather a physically strong heroine. Jane Eyre is a good example of a strong, female character- but was she one because she could do karate? No. When I read the series, Rose's character definitely goes downhill- her endless flaws are annoying as well as how selfish and hypocritical she is as a person. Her infatuation with Dimitri is unhealthy as she hero-worships and tries to kiss his ass- I've become tired of how many times Rose dearest has repeated the word \"badass\" and \"God\" when describing how amazing he is. She is not emotionally strong, at all - she doesn't stand up to Dimitri when he slutshames her and she justs stands there, let's him humilate her and does nothing about it. Whatever happened to a woman being free with her sexuality and standing her own ground at society's double standards? Hmm? Dimitri on the other hand isn't the God of badassery that Rose makes him out to be, I think I should put him next to Edward Cullen as being one of the most boring love interests ever. He is so very bland, and has no development whatsoever, I fail to understand as to why people think he is an amazing character when he is as shallow as a puddle. Rose rides his dick too hard as well as everyone in the VA!verse- am I supposed to be all starry eyed that he killed Strigoi which is exactly what he's supposed to be doing? He also strikes me off as a dickhead- degrading Rose because she is immature, pushing her away because she is too young for him yet he has no problem checking her body out because her humps bring all the boys to the yard, and almost sleeping with her even though she is 17 and he is 24. Ugh, for fuck's sake is there a statutory rape law in Montana? He is just a sleazy creep who likes to read cowboy novels. The romance between the two is forced and there is no chemistry- more like a telling than showing. Other characters such as Lissa, Christian, Mason etc, I adored. although Lissa does strike off as a bit weak at first but as the story goes on, she definitely improves- I just wish we saw more of her. Her love interest is a million times more interesting than Dimitri- Christian is charismatic, snarky and mysterious which is why I looked forward to Lissa/Christian interactions because they had a lot of sexual tension and chemistry. Honestly, I'd rather have those two be the centre of the story line than boring russian cowboy and Rose. I've noticed how the secondary characters are a lot more developed than the main ones which was the reason that I kept on reading the rest of the series-otherwise I would have stowed my copy of Vampire Academy away and never look twice at it. The writing is OK, nothing special- I wanted more description than a simple account. I don't think Ms. Mead has an editor that does their job properly- there were countless grammar errors & typos that did throw me off while reading the book. ...more", "Title": "Vampire Academy"},
