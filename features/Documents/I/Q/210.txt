It's that I'd never be able to pick this book out of a generic YA book lineup. It's like a ninja, perfectly blending into its surroundings, into that painfully generic landscape that plagues YA literature recently, the lackluster background against which few gems truly stand out. And gem this one is not. I think at this point there is a formula that many YA writers view as foolproof, and that's what we have got working here. First of all, the story has to be told in the first person by a young female protagonist.\u00b9 And so here we have a teenage girl who thinks of herself as unremarkable and plain\u00b2 but at least she has the three winning S's - she's smart and sarcastic and sassy!\u00b3 \u00b9 Why does it seem that almost every YA story nowadays features the first-person narrative by a teenage girl? Is that a new law? \u00b2 We know she is plain because she has the ugliness-defining brown hair, a YA prerequisite for plainness. Also, she is too skinny, which apparently is a common YA flaw. Skinny brown-haired women, ladies and gentlemen. The ugliness is overpowering, right? \u00b3 Or, actually, that's what we're *supposed* to think. What she comes across is the OTHER S's: sullen, sulky and self-absorbed. She is also a bit stupid\u00b9. Oh, and also specially-equipped-to-see-negatives-in-every-situation-including-perfectly-happy-times. Seriously, coming from poverty and harsh military life, she still finds the will to complain about a horrible horrible day in what amounts to the Dreamland of this kingdom because people were soooooo meeeeeeeeeaaaaaaan to her, woe! \u00b9 Case in point for stupidity - you don't mouth off to the second most powerful person in the kingdom who you believe is capable of evil. You just don't. It does not come across as sassy but as stupid. Anyway, then she finds a super-special snowlake-unique power that apparently no one realized she had, and eventually becomes all pretty and desirable and stuff. And lands herself in a boarding school/king's court full of mean girls\u00b9 and even has several makeovers! Along the way, she unexpectedly becomes a fighting badass! And then there are two hot boys\u00b2 swooning over her! \u00b9 Why is it that most pretty girls in books like these always have to be evil to the plain-Jane protagonist? Why do women writing about women tend to vilify women? (Yes, I loved writing the word 'women' three times in that short sentence.) I know, I know, there is Genya who is nice, but all other pretty women are eeeeevillll or stupid. \u00b2 Well, in all honesty, one of them could make centenarians look like children. (view spoiler) [And it does turn out that it's not just Alina's inner and outer beauty that turn him on but that he actually has an ulterior motive for pursuing her. Therefore this love triangle gets snuffed out rather quickly. But I do think that this ill-fated almost-romance/attraction will come into play in the sequels, however. (hide spoiler) ] At some point, she inevitably makes a requisite decision about self-sacrifice for a noble cause, if needed. There are declarations of undying love. She also makes big and stupid decisions for the sake of loooooovvvvvvvveeeeeeeee. Sounds pretty generic, doesn't it? Yes, it does. But the attempt at drawing inspiration from Russian culture could have set it apart from the other generic stories for the largely Western-centric crowd. See, adding some Rusianness is supposed to make your story infinitely cooler, right? But alas, that did not happen. If not for occasionally thrown in exotic-sounding (to a Westerner) Russian names for people and objects (add a samovar to a story and occasionally call your king a tsar for your ethnic flavor!) , you would really not be able to tell where this story is supposed to take place. I guess the real country where it's set is the faceless characterless dystopic YA-landia with the traditional settings, stock responses, and common conventions. ============================ But since I read this book for its butchered (and really inconsequential) Russianness\u00b9, I will spend some more time discussing it. (Tatiana, by the way, has written an excellent review touching on this subject.) \u00b9Speaking of getting so many Russian things wrong. Well, first of all, why do we even care? Well, the reasons are twofold and both stem from the fact that Russia is the biggest country on the planet , which means that: (a) It should be pretty easy to find information about its culture and language, including a native Russian speaker beta-reader, perhaps. (b) There are quite a few people in this world that will be easily able to spot out what you did wrong. Also, don't give me BS about the country of Ravka not being Russia but simply being inspired by it. Bullshit. You use Russian names and Russian words in your book - therefore I will assume that Russian is indeed the language you are using. End of story. The titular 'Grisha' is still what makes me cringe. Every. Single. Time. It is a diminutive of a Russian name Grigori, and roughly equivalent to English 'Greg'. Just imagine you reading a story where the elite yielding mysterious powers is collectively known as 'Mike' or 'Bob' or 'Billy'. Do I need to say more? ................ .............. Grigori Rasputin. His mom probably called him Grisha. Since Alina is a woman, her last name should be a feminine version of Starkov. Basically, her last name is Starkova.\u00b9 \u00b9My original thought that maybe in this world Russians just stopped distinguishing between feminine and masculine last names was proven wrong when there was a mention of the character who does possess a feminine name - Morozova\u00b2. Therefore I must conclude that the distinction is preserved in Ravka. \u00b2Interestingly, the character with the feminine last name Morozova has a masculine first name - Ilya. So either this world is flip-flopped in that way, or Bardugo could not bring herself to do a simple google search of name Ilya to see where it was a boy or a girl. It is NEVER a female name, despite ending in a vowel (just like Nikita is only a male name, by the way). It's particularly annoying because a 10-second google search could have spared this mistake; no knowledge of Russian culture is even necessary here! 'Otkazat'sya' really does NOT mean 'abandoned'. It means 'to refuse'. It's a verb and should not be used as a noun. A 5-second Google translate search gives me a better version than Bardugo came up with. KVAS. OH MY GOD, KVAS. Dear Alina, a boy who groped you while drunk on kvas does not have an excuse of drunkenness, after all. Kvas is a fermented drink containing less than 1% alcohol. You'd have to drink a barrel of it to be drunk, after which you'd be too busy peeing nonstop rather than groping girls. For crying out loud, my mom let me drink it when I was a toddler. Getting drunk on kvas is like suggesting that people get drunk on Seven-Up. Therefore comparing champagne and kvas is like comparing oranges to chalk or monkeys to cactus. Same kid after 10 years of kvas drinking. Dangerous drink, I say, dangerous! Now, there were good things about this book, too, don't get me wrong. It was a very easy read in a relatively decent prose. It flowed well (but so did Twilight, after all) . The love triangle died in utero. There was an actual plot and not just lovesick gazing. The love interest was actually a rather decent guy who is not tortured by his dark past. But there was NOTHING about this story that allowed it to stand out even a little bit out of the uniform landscape of similar books. Nothing except the little frustrations with the misused Russian inspiration. I guess you'd like it if you're looking for another book that's \"just like\" a fantastical book with a young heroine and a love story that you read and loved. If you're looking for any originality, it's not there. Therefore I award it the lackluster 2 stars.

The characters, the world-building...it completely blew me away. There were moments when I was so stunned by the beauty and the brilliance that I had to stop reading. I never wanted this book to end. This is the best YA fantasy novel I've read since SABRIEL or THE GOLDEN COMPASS. (3.5) I really enjoyed this and I'm definitely going to be continuing on with this trilogy, but I did have a few issues with it. While I was fascinated by the world, but at the same time, I didn't feel like the world was fleshed out enough. We don't really get much world building, you're just kind of thrown into the world, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but for me there were things that I needed to be explained more for me to be able to fully visualize the setting.

I did LOVE <---A>Leigh Bardugo</---A>'s writing style. I found it to be very unique!

Instead, I'm afraid you'll have to settle for my words: THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING! I wish I could unread it just so I can go back and re-read it again for the first time. Yes, I loved it that much. Now I've come to the part where I am supposed to describe to you the awesomeness that is Shadow and Bone and I'm finding that rather difficult to do. Why is that? Is it because while reading a book you love your get so swept away with the story that you can't be bothered to take notes? Or perhaps it's the fact that you don't want to give away too much of the story? You want other potential readers to go into the book blind, expecting little and gaining everything the story has to offer? I suspect it is a little of both for me and with that, I offer my sincerest apologies if you do not find this review helpful. It is my hope, however, that my inability to do this book justice in my review speaks volumes in and of itself. Shadow and Bone follows the story of <---C>Alina Starkov</---C>, a remarkable young girl, who holds a power not even she realizes she has. All her life she's never fit in. Not in the orphanage where she grew up alongside her best friend, Mal, nor in the First Army where she serves as a mapmaker. In her world people of elite status with unique abilities, called Grisha, serve as nothing more than fanciful servants to the kingdom of Ravka. \u00a0One day, while protecting Mal, it is revealed that she too is Grisha with a very rare and sought after power: the ability to summon sunlight. She soon finds herself in a very different world filled with adventure, betrayal, and a sinister plot that could destroy all of Ravka. Within the first 10% of Shadow and Bone I knew that I would give it at least 4 stars. The book begins quickly immersing the reader into the kingdom of Ravka head on. Terms are thrown at the reader at a reasonable pace for a fantasy novel and for once I didn't immediately feel overwhelmed or the need to \"play ketchup\" with the characters. I can tell Bardugo employed the rule of \"show, don't tell\" and I believe she did it well. I found myself hanging on the edge of my seat waiting for more of the world to be revealed to me. There was never a dull moment reading Shadow and Bone ; no downtime for me to catch my breath. And I loved every minute of it! I thought the plot was very well done and I got so caught up in the story that the plot twists just blew me away. I was so engrossed that by the time the climax hit I felt an intake of breath and couldn't tear myself away from the book for the duration of the read! Oh. My. God. NOooooooo! And the characters.... ahhhhh, the characters! I loved them all to pieces! Alina is naive, candid, and feeble in the beginning, but she grows so much throughout the novel. (Yes, Yes! I know! Character development! It really does still exist in YA novels!) Does she make mistakes? Absolutely! But she realizes them and she strives to be better. I can see there is a lot of conflict in her character to come in the next two novels in the series and I am VERY eager to see how that is handled. I also loved the Darkling. I can't really say much about him because I am NOT giving away any spoilers in this review--not even in a spoiler tag because I know how some of you are!-- but he was awesome! Just the right amount of intrigue and mystery. And Mal. *sigh* Oh, Mal. Let's just say he is another love interest we can add to our swoon worthy list right next to Tucker Avery . ;) \"I missed you every hour. And you know what the worst part was? It caught me completely by surprise. I'd catch myself just walking around to find you, not for any reason , just out of habit, because I'd seen something that I wanted to tell you about or because I wanted to hear your voice. And then I'd realize that you weren't there anymore, and every time, every single time , it was like having the wind knocked out of me. I've risked my life for you. I've walked half the length of Ravka for you, and I'd do it again and again and again just to be with you, just to starve with you and freeze with you and hear you complain about hard cheese every day. So don't tell me why we don't belong together,\" he said fiercely. I think it goes without saying I loved the writing. The descriptions were vivid, easy to visualize and thankfully, not overdone (I'm really hoping there will be a map in the finished copy. Please tell me there's a map waiting for me!). The book is told through Alina's PoV, so we get a first hand account of the happenings. And boy are there some happenings! I'll tell you one thing, Bardugo can write a kissing scene... well . And the romance? Man, I just loved the romance. It was so sweet and by the end it just tore at my heart! The moment our lips met, I knew with pure and piercing certainty that I would have waited for him forever. *sigh* This book. I just love it! I'm really not sure what else to say about Shadow and Bone besides the obvious: it was awesome and you should read it. If you are a fantasy lover, rejoice! If fantasy isn't your thing, still rejoice! Because this is a book that is sure to take you and your heart on a wild adventure this summer. EDIT: I've been informed that there will be a map included drawn by Keith Thompson!

BO Damn you, Leigh Barduga. Damn you for tricking me. Leigh Barduga is like some kind of literary crouching tiger, hidden dragon or something. You would be forgiven, upon commencing this novel, for thinking Shadow and Bone is redundant, cliched piece of tripe book with poor story-telling, average writing and a predictable plot. People who haven't read countless Young Adult novels probably wouldn't notice the trends, but I did. This is what I thought and Leigh led me down the primrose path until... BOOM! Game change. Glorious, glorious game change. Black is white, up is down, you are not secretly attracted to me. EVERYTHING CHANGES. Kaching. Lights on. Real show begins and we hope you enjoyed that prelude. Also, while you weren't looking, we falcon-punched your ovaries. The themes of Shadow and Bone center around power, and the struggle for it. What does it mean? What is it worth? What do you do with it? Also, there's love and romancey stuff for those who care for such things - and who have a functioning heart. More importantly, for me, was the violence, court intrigue and sexy times of which make up some part of this novel. These aspects were definitely there but they were flirted with. I would have liked more of these and a little less of the boarding-house shenanigans and bitchy-mean girl drama. It was outside these factors that I loved the novel. It's strengths definitely rely on its characters and powerful storyline because the actual narration and writing tended toward the telling as opposed to showing side. For example: Alexei's fingers slipped on the railing. I lunged forward and grabbed his arm. \"Hold on!\" I cried. Then the flame vanished, and in the darkness I felt Alexei's fingers pulled from mine. \"Alexei!\" I shouted. His screams faded into the sounds of battle as the volca carried him into the dark. Another burst of flame lit the sky, but he was gone. Still, I'm wondering if maybe the things I loved most about Shadow and Bone will be carried on in the next novel. To the very last page I loved the Darkling - not because he was sexy - but for the dark, rawness of his character. The dynamic it played with Alina in how she saw herself. Identity, concepts of misplaced idealism. Lust, love, ownership vs freely given love. It was all there amidst a world-building that was surprisingly lite for this caliber of novel - yet hinted at so much more. Overall, a great read and I look forward to the next book where Leigh will probably rip out my still-beating heart and feed it to a raging bear while I applaud in amazement. Or, you know, something synonymous. ...more As seen on The Readventurer 2.5 stars It is alright, if you are into fantasy lite.

I, on the other hand, am a little weary of this lightish, breezy and superficial entertainment. Give me something juicier, something more thoughtful, something more sophisticated. Shadow and Bone is a decent book. Bardugo's writing style is easy and engaging. The plot is developed enough to masquerade the fact that the biggest chunk of it is the usual boarding school fare with makeovers, mean girl drama, petty rivalries, balls and a bit of steamy(ish) romance with the hottest guy on the block. Bardugo even succeeds at creating an \"exotic\" backdrop for her story - an early 20th century Russia-inspired fantasy land of Rivka. Even with my issues concerning the accuracy of everything borrowed from Russian culture, I will still say that the author manages to create a very distinct atmosphere in her novel. And speaking of this atmosphere, Russian \"flavor\" if you will, Shadow and Bone is a rare book whose covers (both US and UK) reflect the novel's mood well, even though I find UK's tagline to be a bit misleading and melodramatic. This novel is not as romancey as the line \"A dark heart. A pure soul. A love that will last forever\" would imply. With that said, the reason I did not enjoy this book the way I had hoped I would is that it is just so uncomplicated and straight-forward. I have no usual complaints about Bardugo's characters and the plot. But they are familiar and well used and not very rich. These characters are simple, void of complex emotions and motivations. Same goes for the plot and conflicts. There is no complexity to them either. The conflicts are of good/evil variety. The plot is easily predictable. Twists? What twists? I do not think Shadow and Bone is a good fit for many adult readers, unless they are in a search for going-through-the-motions sort of story with a standard \"kick-ass\" protagonist (I am thinking Tris from Divergent or Ismae from Grave Mercy ), and they do not expect to be challenged intellectually or emotionally. Now, to the part of my review that will reflect exclusively my personal problems with this book, which will not bother 99.9% of its potential readers. Shadow and Bone is, as I mentioned earlier, a Russia-inspired fantasy. I took pains to check out Leigh Bardugo's website, to see how exactly she addressed this inspiration. Here are her words: \"Ravka and its language were heavily inspired by Russia, but with a few deliberate exceptions, the words and place names in Shadow & Bone are my own invention. My goal was to keep things simple and to make sure that Ravkan words still had resonance for readers. In short, I took a lot of liberties and I hope the purists won\u2019t beat me about the head and shoulders.\" Sure, I do not want to be a language nazi or anything. I can skim over Russian-sounding made-up words, even though they linguistically do not make much sense. Not every writer can be like Catherynne M. Valente , who embraced Russianness so fully in her Deathless , that I had to do some research to find out if she was Russian herself (she is not). But is it too much to ask of an author to at least google the actual Russian words she does use in her work? I swear, it would only take 10 minutes to research the glaring mistakes I found. For instance, if you want to give your characters Russian names, it is not that hard to find out that men and women in Russia have different variations of the same last name? Let's take the book's main character, Alina Starkov. Starkov is a masculine version of the last name. Correctly, it should be Alina Starkova. In the same way, there is another character, whose name is Ilya Morozova. The problem with this name is that Ilya is actually a male name, while the last name has a female form. In the book, Ilya Morozova is a \"she.\" If you google \"Russian last names,\" this information comes up in the second or third link from the top. How much time would it take to do this research? Then there is a matter of \"kvas,\" a beverage everyone seems to get drunk on in Shadow and Bone . In reality, you can not actually get drunk consuming it. This is a non-alcoholic beverage (well, almost, it occasionally has alcohol content up to 1%) which is given to children as well as adults, like, let's say, soda. Wiki this word, I am not lying. You want to write about alcohol, use \"pivo\" or \"braga\" or \"samogon,\" if researching that is too hard, use \"vodka.\" And, I swear, the last example (of many on my list). The name of this trilogy - The Grisha (in the book, the Grisha are magic wielding army). Grisha is actually a short form of the male name Grigori. Come on now, no better ideas, no better words to call your magicians other than this random personal name? Or \"otkazat'sya,\" which in Bardugo's interpretation means \"The Abandoned.\" In reality \"otkazat'sya\" is a verb which translates into \"to refuse.\" That is why I am saying that even the words made up by the author make no sense, linguistically. To be sure, all these things will not bother anyone except select few, but I do not think it is too wrong to expect the author who builds her whole magical universe using Russian culture, to respect this culture enough to do a cursory google search, to give her work some appearance of credibility and care? This sloppy use of a foreign (my) culture affected my enjoyment of the novel. Shadow and Bone is not an isolated example of a lazy handling of Russian language and culture, and very often I feel very much compelled to offer authors, who choose to base their stories on Russia, my help, to at least check the spelling of the words. But then I see that they do not care to do the most basic of researches, so why should I care? To wrap this up, I do not recommend against reading Shadow and Bone . It is a light and engaging enough entertainment. In fact, after reading a few Goodreads reviews, it looks like many people found it to be utterly enchanting. I am glad they do. I, however, will not be back for more. ...more So many YA fantasy romances out there these days.

Imagine a cross between Cashore's Graceling and Westerfeld's Leviathan . . . and yet Shadow and Bone is unique. Our main characters, Alina and Mal, grow up as orphans at the estate of a kindly duke, until the time comes for them to serve their country. Both are tested by the Grisha, an ancient and powerful order of magicians, but neither show aptitude, so Mal becomes an accomplished military tracker, while Alina studies as an army cartographer and has nothing to look forward to but a mundane existence. Homely and scrawny, Alina watches as her dashing, handsome best friend Mal, whom she secretly loves, gets attention from all the girls. Their lives change when their regiment is ordered across the Shadow Fold, a deadly rift of darkness that cuts Ravka in two, separating the eastern capital from its ports in West Ravka. When the caravan is attacked by gargoyle-like monsters called volcra, Alina discovers powers she didn't know she had. Immediately, she becomes the most important person in the kingdom, the target of enemy assassins, and is whisked away to the palace of the Darkling, the head of the Grisha and right hand of the king, to learn the ways of magic. Alina might hold the secret to destroying the Shadow Fold and saving Ravka, but only if she survives her enemies -- some from other countries, some from within the kingdom itself. Shadow and Bone works on every level. It's a believable and poignant romance. It's a great mystery in which the villains and heroes are not at all who they seem. It's a first-rate adventure. Maybe I was especially drawn to this book because I got to visit Russia last summer and can easily imagine the Grisha slipping through the corridors of the Winter Palace, but I suspect this book will appeal to many readers even if they have no knowledge of Russian history. I'll be anxiously waiting for the second book in the series! ...more Loved it. More later! I loved it from page one. One incredible journey.

Well, not exactly\u2026 I struggled with that book because of how the writing was, in my opinion, complex and all those new terms that I\u2019ve never seen or heard of before. I literally had a dictionary next to me and searched through it one or two times per new page turned. So, yeah, I did not have a great experience even if I ended up enjoyed the book. It in fact took me three weeks to read it when, you all know, I now finish a book in 1, 2 or 3 days\u2014exceptions apply. I was reading so slowly. SO slowly. The point is... I did know about Shadow and Bone at that time as well but was very afraid of not rightly comprehending the world-building since it seemed to me very complex, just by reading the blurb. Yesterday, though, I finally felt like starting it, even if in my interior I was wondering if I was truly ready and going to understand it well. Turns out I didn\u2019t have to worry and knowing that I imporved my English so much in only a year makes me so happy. But, also, Leigh Bardugo did a great job introducing it to us along with its elements and I hope she will surprise us with many other new things related to the world-building in the sequels because it is amazing. AMAZING. Alina is the kind of main character I love reading about in a fantasy book. Yes, she could have been more fierce, strong and clever, but was is wonderful still and her vulnerable part actually made me connect with her and relate to her more than I usually do with main characters. I enjoyed seeing her character development and, when she felt sad, I surprisingly felt her feelings too. That\u2019s how much I sympathized and was invested in her story. Mal\u2026he is charming and I couldn\u2019t resist him. The kind of relationship he and Alina have is unique and true and definitely beautiful. \u2018\u2018Just you and me,\u2019\u2019 Mal said. \u2018\u2018Really?\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018It\u2019s always just you and me, Alina.\u2019\u2019 They were meant for each other. Although, as much as I may have loved Mal, I did have a perference for the mysterious and dangerous Darkling.

You know, I've wondered ever since Shadow and Bone was released last year whether I would fall into the camp of gushing, never-ending love for it... or find myself sat sipping kvas with the other sceptics and laughing over the preposterous idea that we could ever get drunk on it. I was prepared for it to go either way. However, I find myself uselessly sitting somewhere in the middle, lonesomely twiddling my thumbs and pondering all the different things I liked but didn't love and disliked but didn't hate. How very annoying of me. I'm sat here going through my mental list of the book's faults whilst simultaneously trying to figure out what organs and/or limbs I can get away with exchanging for an ARC of Siege and Storm . I mean, I didn't like Alina that much. She was okay. She was fine. But you know something is wrong when the heroine is merely \"okay\" and \"fine\". I found her a touch ( a touch too much ) on the wimpy side for my liking, she was too eager to play the damsel in distress on multiple occasions but I've heard she gets better in the sequel. Let's hope so. Admittedly, I only decided to read this now because of the hype surrounding the sequel so I have my fingers crossed that Siege and Storm can rid us of the problems I have with this series. Especially the fact that this is quite a poor excuse for fantasy. Limited world-building, light fantasy-style background which is heavily diluted by romance, mean girls, bitchiness and seemingly useless tidbits of information about noble life. This is like the chick-lit, high school version of fantasy, filled with characters who are supposedly hardcore warriors but spend much of the novel keeping their hardcore warrior hands disappointingly clean. The roughest, most gruesome bit of this story is perhaps when a poor stag gets murdered. Which is really just depressing all round. Thankfully, though, the novel's large amount of tame scenes did provide me with some entertainment and a few laughs. There is a certain base addictive quality to Bardugo's writing that makes it incredibly easy to digest and even necessary to read on. Another negative - sorry - is the rather silly obsession with looks in the novel. For one, I couldn't give a damn about the various vanities of the Grisha women; for another, it annoyed me how Alina seemed to equate her worth with her looks from the very beginning. She denies her power can possibly exist because she isn't a luminous ball of hotness like the others. But, as with good old plain Bella Swan, everyone falls in love with her anyway. To be honest, that is an unfair comparison because Alina - even with her faults - is a far more interesting character than Bella. But still, get a grip on yourself. And douse yourself with some badassery so you can stop being such a wimp because so far this world is looking awfully like the disappointing one of Grave Mercy . Also - is there a love triangle here? I'm not even certain what's happening. I kinda hope there is. Ha, bet you weren't expecting that! But, you know, Darkling is really quite a sexy word, don't you think? And maybe Ms Bardugo hasn't got the whole fantasy thing down in this book but she sure knows exactly what she's doing with his characterisation. He's dangerous, he's sexy, he likes to make out with you in secret rooms, he's arrogant with a little side order of hidden feelings to kick you right in the ovaries and the heart at the same time. I suppose Mal is the safer and more sensible option and the one I'd be telling Alina to go for if this was the real world and she was a friend of mine. But - yay! - this isn't the real world and the complexity of the Darkling attracts me. The way I feel about him is similar to how I felt about Ido in Eona but hopefully this won't have a similar conclusion. Thank you if you actually read my non-review. If anyone knows how I can acquire an ARC of the sequel, please tell me and I shall be forever grateful. ...more People have been throwing 4 and 5 stars at this book left and right, and I wonder what I missed.

It started out strong: atmospheric and engrossing. Past People have been throwing 4 and 5 stars at this book left and right, and I wonder what I missed. I was prepared to give this book 2 stars, maybe even 3 if I was feeling generous on the day I wrote the review, but as I pushed myself through the first half of this book, I encountered increasingly more things that irritated me, until the one that pushed me over the edge and convinced me that I\u2019d be okay with not ever finishing SHADOW AND BONE. It started out strong: atmospheric and engrossing. Past the prologue, however, when the book switches into first-person narration, it was downhill for me. I simply could not get behind Alina as the narrator. Instead of a strong and self-reliant young woman, we get a clueless and un-self-confident weakling who enters \u201cdamsel in distress\u201d mode the second things start going crazy, never mind the unique abilities she supposedly possesses. She\u2019s in the habit of saying things along the lines of \u201cBut I can\u2019t possibly be special!\u201d every time anyone tries to talk to her about her abilities. Even better is her reasoning behind why she can\u2019t be special: because the grisha\u2014of whom she is now one\u2014are all beautiful women, and she is plain. Really, now? SHADOW AND BONE\u2019s strange obsession with the significance of beauty continues as Alina enters court and promptly receives a magical makeover. This is a very important step to her character development, peoples! Right. Alina\u2019s closest confidante at court is this magical makeover artist who\u2014obviously\u2014is the most beautiful woman ever, and\u2014obviously\u2014is hated by nearly everyone at court. If that doesn\u2019t make me roll my eyes enough, there\u2019s the additional grievance that Bardugo apparently underestimates the intelligence of her YA audience. There are constantly \u201ctelling\u201d statements when characters, locations, and/or events are introduced that forcibly \u201cguide\u201d readers into thinking a certain way about that character, location, and/or event. For instance: The Grisha seemed obsessed with emulating serf ways, right down to the clothes we wore beneath our kefta. But there was something a little silly about eating \u201chearty peasant fare\u201d off porcelain plates, beneath a dome inlaid with real gold. And what peasant wouldn\u2019t pick pastry over pickled fish? The Little Palace was a storybook version of serf life, no more like the real Ravka than the glitter and gilt of the royal court. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to, I don\u2019t know, show this gradually through depictions of court vs. common life, instead of dumping this theme on us within a few pages of introducing us to the court? And when the queen is introduced: The Queen was beautiful, with smooth blond hair in a perfect coiffure, her delicate features cold and lovely. But there was also something a little odd about her face. Her irises seemed a little too blue, her hair too yellow, her skin too smooth. I wondered just how much work Genya had done on her. On the magical makeup artist\u2019s crush on a regular guy: Genya\u2019s voice was light, but it had a funny little edge to it, and when I glanced at her, I saw that there were bright spots of color on her perfect cheekbones. I looked back through the windows to where I could still see David\u2019s bony shoulders and messy brown hair. I smiled. If a creature as gorgeous as Genya could fall for a skinny, studious Fabrikator, there might be hope for me yet. That passage would\u2019ve been so much stronger without that last sentence, which is not only over-the-top obvious, but also, once again, unnecessarily and annoyingly, brings up Alina\u2019s lack of self-confidence. And so on and so forth. The Inner Editor in me was busy slashing out entire pages of words and mentally ordering the author to rewrite nearly everything. Other reviewers do a much better job of talking about SHADOW AND BONE\u2019s lack of research into Russian culture. My knowledge of Russian culture and history is woefully lacking, so I\u2019ll let them talk about that. But I will mention the thing that got me so mad that when I read it, I actually screamed out loud and immediately turned off the Kindle, knowing that this book had no more chances of getting me to read onwards. Writing a \u201cRussian-flavored\u201d fantasy with hardly any research into Russian culture is bad enough\u2014but then there was the TRULY AWFUL use of Asian stereotypes that had me fuming. Our instructor, Botkin Yul-Erdene, wasn\u2019t Grisha; he was a former Shu Han mercenary who had fought in wars on every continent for any army that could afford his particular gift for violence. Shu Han is clearly the SHADOW AND BONE-world equivalent of the Chinese race, taking its name from the ancient Han Dynasty, but with the unfortunate connection to the stereotype of hulking, dangerous-looking, surly, war-happy Asian soldiers-for-hire. (In pop culture, you can see this stereotype in the Disney movie Mulan , where they are known as Huns, which is another name for the Xiongnu, a nomadic military-centric tribe located in present-day Mongolia and coexisting\u2014not necessarily peaceably\u2014with the Han Dynasty. And this is all stuff you can glean off of Wikipedia, which makes it entirely inadequate for academic essays and fictions claiming to draw their influences from real-world histories and cultures.) \u201cIs this what they teach in First Army?\u201d he sneered in his heavy Shu accent as I stumbled up a hill... \u201cBlock!\u201d he shouted, knocking me backward. \u201cFaster! Maybe little girl likes to be hit?\u201d... But before we were out the door, [Botkin] called, \u201cTomorrow, little girl comes early, trains with Botkin.\u201d Why, for the love of any religion\u2019s god(s), must Botkin sound like a campy version of an Asian instructor who would appear in movies the likes of The Karate Kid ??!!??!! That was it. I was done. I\u2019m fine with authors reimagining ancient or contemporary cultures into similar cultures in their speculative fiction. But when all evidence points to research that extends no further than cursorily watching the type of bad kung fu or propagandist Cold War-era movies that are the staples of fratty college sports teams\u2019 bus entertainment (and I make this comparison from experience), I reserve the right to be pissed off and not finish reading your travesty of a misappropriation of rich cultures and condemn your perpetuation of hurtful stereotypes. The only thing that tempted to read onwards is more mention of the Darkling, he of the tall, silent, and powerful. But he\u2019s kind of a YA trope as well, and ultimately, my unfounded crush on the mysterious man was not enough to overcome my frustration with the elementary writing no-nos peppering the book. Feel free to give this a try if it intrigues you, but know what you\u2019re getting yourself into. ...more HA! Just kidding. This isn't your fifth-grade English paper, darling.

I do though, want even my heroines to have some confidence and not rely on others. Is that too much of a demand? Alina seemed too preoccupied with her feelings rather than looking at the bigger picture. Even in the end, she waited till the last minute to truly see things. The Darkling seemed like the most intriguing and complex character here. As I didn't feel connected or interested in the MC, I did in him. Everything he said was engraved with a deeper meaning or reason. It was interesting trying to figure out his next move and the way he worked. As for the MC, her move was always to, either A:brood, brood, brood. Or B: Wait for someone to command her. I feel like the ending could of been more climactic for her character development. We could have gotten a great \"I am stronger\" quote. Let's move on to Mal: Okay, I didn't have a problem with him. For some reason I feel like he's just another one of those characters used for the \"we're different people now\" trope, in which the MC moves on to find her actual love. At times his character got me smiling, but then he'd spout stuff like: \"I came to save you because you saved me\" Sure is nice that the reason you wanted to save your best friend since childhood, is because you \"owe\" them. \"I'm sorry it took me so long to see you Alina, but I see you now.\" Maybe I just can't find that touching, but rather convenient. Or maybe, I'm an awful person who doesn't understand romance. Then there was Genya: Eh, she was okay. Towards the ending, I surely didn't like her. I understand why she followed along, but the friendship just seemed wrong after the turning point. Her entire character seemed twisted from the woman we knew. (had to find a Loki gif in reference to the Loki comments) I liked Genya originally because she didn't care about fitting in, but suddenly that was the only thing that mattered. Alright, now back to The Darkling First of all, this song is perfect for him: Arsonist's Lullabye - Hozier I loved what was done with his character: No excuses and no trying to explain himself. He just took it, and let people believe what they wanted to. The big question everyone is asking is: Does he actually care for Alina? See, I don't think he didn't feel anything for her. (view spoiler) [Of course he wanted to use her, but there was definitely desire on his part. Maybe a desire for someone to be his equal, to have the same motives, or to understand him. (hide spoiler) ] Whatever it was, there's definitely something complex there. Do I ship them? It wouldn't work, due to the two characters being on different stands. Yes they might have some fluffy moments in the future, but I doubt it can progress to something more. He can't even pull a Warner on us. Maybe he could pull the \"I never thought I would care you\" smut, that's as far as I see any (view spoiler) [redemption (hide spoiler) ] going. My big question is: What was the point of the mean girl? Are you just there to be there? Must we always have a Regina George. There's one thing I'm still curious about: The Princes. We aren't told there's two princes, with one mysterious one roaming around, only to not ever learn more about them. I refuse to believe that. *google searches to make sure theory is correct* THERE YOU ARE (view spoiler) [NIKOLAI! (hide spoiler) ] If that was supposed to be a big reveal...

I've had this book sitting on my book shelf for ages now, and just hadn't had the time to pick it up. after seeing all the fuss over Leigh Bardugo's new book, (which i also have idly sitting on my shelf), i decided i should read shadow and bone, and as mentioned previously, I'm impressed! This is an instant YA attraction. It's a typical fantasy YA with just enough action, the perfect romance, dancing around a fast paced plot and smooth eloquent writing. The characters are easily depict-able, and their roles are immediately introduced. The book wastes no time getting to the point, and although that is a risky path in fantasy, this boldness only added fever to the book. It took me exactly 4 and a half hours to read this, and not a single second in this consecutive reading did i feel even slightly bored. The book plays with excitement the way a child would with a new toy, cautiously at first and then a reckless swan dive all at once. I particularly enjoyed that little detail. Moving on to the characters; the main character, Alina, is really any other YA female protagonist with hidden talent, and a role to fulfill, but that is not all in all, in any way bad. I think given the way the YA genre works, with all the diversity, at some point at least one character will resemble another from a different story. However; it is adamant, that the simple and minor details shaping her main character create a sense of uniqueness, a sort of trademark to her writing. I believe the naivety of Alina expressed so honestly and openly got my attention, the simple reality of an insecure girls desire to fit in and be wanted, if not necessarily loved. The world created around her has its flaws, but i think perhaps its the perfect imperfections that make this world desirable. The way the world revolves and builds, and then simply unravels once again, it made me feel as if i were living in this alternate reality. The book had incredibly good pace, and it was truly action riddles. The descriptions of opulence and grandeur, and likewise destruction and chaos were vivid, yet not excessively detailed. i felt like the book prodded and pushed your imagination but didn't try to override it, something i truly appreciated. i just have an inexplicable pull towards all things dark and evil, and then right there in the middle a beacon of light coming to the rescue. I love Mal, and will continue to do so for eternity, because every powerful and troubled heroine needs to be an emotional damsel every once in a while, and who better than the handsome boy who you've been secretly in love with for the past couple of years. I feel however, there is more to the darkling, and i hope we get to see the different side as the book progresses. Cant wait to read the next book!!!!! ...more **Update 5/14/16...

For those of you who would like to take the Darkling with you in the car on the way to work in the mornings, or for those of you who want to get a feel for the legit badassery that is this series.. here's a Spotify PLAYLIST!! ;) ;) So let me try to put my love for this book into a few categories. Overall Plot + Theme Alright. I don't want to go over the details of the plot in this review -- because I went into this not knowing one darn thing about it so every single page was a surprise for me! What I will say is this... this book will be a wild ride in a dark fairytale-esque world with unpredictable characters. There is action, magic, romance, intrigue.. and really.. what more could you want from a series? I was absolutely 100% entranced with every page that I read... and that feeling continued with the second and third book. But I will say this... just when I thought I knew what was going on... just when I thought I was safe... well, Leigh Bardugo, you got me. THAT PLOT TWIST THO.... AND MY FEELINGS AFTER THAT.... I found myself jumping out of my bed screaming.. LITERALLY screaming... \"Run Alina run!!!\" or \"Give in Alina, just give in!\" The World-building If I could get stuck in any world from any book- this would be the one. It is vivid, dark, magical, and completely entrancing. Here's the thing. I've read a lot of negative reviews basing their reasons on the fact that Leigh Bardugo didn't make a convincing Russian world... but my opinion is that his is her world- not actual Russia- she can do whatever she wants! Sure it has Russian inspiration, but it is clearly its own place. Maybe if you are really attached to the Russian language, it would bother you... but my opinion is to leave preconceived notions aside and let this be what it is. The Characters Alina, our heroine. As with many first books, she needs to grow up some. She is fairly naive, but I liked growing up with her through this series. She's very relatable, in my opinion, darn right hysterical. She's very common with familiar insecurities that we all face. She gets a lot of grief for the mistakes she makes in this book... but come on ladies- I think we would all make the same mistakes she makes, if put in her situation. She will always be one of my favorite heroines because of how relatable she is. I adore her. On that note... (view spoiler) [Like for real... if someone like the Darkling is taking an interest in you... look me in the eyes and tell me you wouldn't act EXACTLY as she acts. And for Mal... the poor girl is heartbroken. Leave her alone. She grows up! (hide spoiler) ] The Darkling I'm not going to say too much about him other than this. He is without a doubt the most interesting character I've ever read about. Ladies, good luck. Honestly I wish I could put some of my favorite quotes from the book here, but it would spoil. I can't even go into the rest of the characters without spoiling. Just enjoy trying to predict everyone! The MAGIC!! [image error] This is my favorite magic system out of any book. I think that stems from me being an artist. The way Leigh describes the powers that some of the characters *cough* have.. its so unique and abstract... like a painting. And classes of magic? Freaking sweet. The Writing This series overall is probably the most quotable one out there, in my opinion anyway. Simply gorgeous. And the pacing? I don't know how some people think this is slow... the pace was like.. holy freaking I can't keep up with my emotions... The AUDIOBOOK! I don't always recommend the audiobook version of a book to people- but the narrator who does this series is PHENOMENAL. It for sure enhanced my experience of this book 100000%. So yes, I HIGHLY recommend giving the audiobook a go! So to summarize all of my thoughts... Thank you Leigh Bardugo for this precious gift. Thank you. And just a hint for the next book... it may or may not introduce my next all time favorite character... ;) ;) DON'T STOP HERE!!

It was 4th of July when I really started reading this. I mean, I'd read like 30 pages the days before, and I'd liked it, but it wasn't until Independence Day that I was hooked. I went to this party at my cousin's house with an in-ground pool, sweets, horror movies, Sparklers, and even a fucking pinata. You know what I did at that party? I did not swim. I did not stuff myself. I did not watch any movies. I did not light shit on fire. I did not beat the bloody fuck out of a paper mache Dora the Explorer. I sat on the floor and read Shadow and Bone the entire night. I just could not put it down, not even to eat cookie dough (gasp!) or watch The Grudge 2. I was just too far gone in Ravka to escape. It was like Bardugo had me in a cage, saying \"Haha, bitch, you're not doing anything until you're done this book.\" It was probably the most enjoyable kidnapping I'd ever experienced. This made my Top 3 Books in The History of Forever shelf. Everything about it was just so ERMAHGERD-I-WERNT-TER-MAHK-LERV-TER-THERS-BERK that I thought my brain would die from so much moe. I was so memorized by the fantab-overload that every time a plot twist came along, no matter how small, it was like on that Mouse Trap ride. You know, that roller coaster that looks all innocent from the ground, but it slams you into 90\u00b0 corners about a hundred or so times while spinning you drunk. So it's been established I really liked this book. (view spoiler) [LOL, understatement. (hide spoiler) ] But why? Well I could answer that in one short sentence: Because this book is made of fucking rainbows, unicorn blood, Lucky Charms, Nutella, bacon, and baby bunny tails. That's right, Leigh, you bunny-detailer. How could you be so heartless? But for those of you who go through life without a sense of humor you poor, poor, pitiful things I will explain what exactly that recipe means. It means this book should win every award on the fucking planet. It means the characters were relatable and unique and had each their own flavor. It means the plot was perfectly paced, complex, captivating, and unpredictable. It means the cover looks like it was carefully painted by emo Michelangelo on drugs (that's a good thing). It means the Darkling is ER-MAH-GERD the smexiest literary dude EVAH! (To be fair, I for some reason pictured him with white-blond hair, alabaster skin, and black and gold embroidered kefta . The blond made him sexier in my eyes.) One thing I really need to point out: this book was able to trick me so easily. Usually I'm pretty good when it comes to predicting plot twists in books. It's not like it's that hard, with how much bullshit \"literature\" is published nowadays. But I was totally thrown in Shadow and Bone. Expect the unexpected, be prepared to sew your heart back together, and be prepared to drool. KK? KK. My overall opinion of this book: Taste the motherfuckin' rainbow!

The only Russian anything I had ever read was Anna Karenina , and let me tell you\u2014NOT a fan: \u201cMy life sucks, so I think I\u2019ll throw myself under a train.\u201d NOPE. Not my thing. So even though it was listed as YA Fantasy (one of my favorite genres), I blew it off. I didn\u2019t need it. I still had one more book from Cinda Williams Chima\u2019s Seven Realms series coming, and Fire and Thorns by Rae Carson was off to an excellent start. I bite my thumb at you, Shadow and Bone . . . *rolls eyes at self* Then I saw it included in one of those Big Deal lists of Top Summer Reads. And I am a HUGE sucker for those lists, so I decided to read it after all. And surprisingly, even though it was a reluctant edition to my summer reading list, I read it almost immediately. And I LOVED it. Love, LOVE, L-O-V-E-D it. Yeah, I tripped over some of the Russian-esque words in the beginning, but it didn\u2019t take long to acclimate. And it was obvious from the start that this was my type of story. I know (though I don\u2019t understand it) that there are tons-o-readers out there who don\u2019t like romance in their YA Fantasy (or Science Fiction) books. If you are one of those, then this is not the book for you, but you should already know that based on the blurb: Glorious. Epic. Irresistible. Romance. Not much room for misinterpretation, is there? And it was fairly clear that this was going to be a friends-to-more-than-friends story and those are the BEST. Until the Darkling showed up . . . Yes, ladies and ladies, here there be love triangles. Doesn\u2019t bother me. I actually like a good love triangle. Keeps things interesting IMO. But for those of you who hate love triangles, read it anyway b/c the last book comes out in June, so you don\u2019t have to wait very long to get your resolution. *bats eyelashes* Alina Starkov and Malyen Oretsev are orphans. They were raised together under the condescension of an ex-military, war-hero Duke who set up one of his residences as an orphanage. They were taught to read and write, and upon coming of age, they both joined the military\u2014Alina as a mapmaker, and Mal as a tracker. They were all each other had growing up, and while they were still dear friends, Mal grew into a robust and handsome young man, who enjoyed flirting with, and chasing after pretty girls, while Alina stayed thin and sickly, and thought only of him<\u2014\u2014it HURTS. They were both part of a group selected to cross the Shadow Fold, a desert-like area of the land covered in impenetrable darkness, and filled with loathsome creatures, to . . . come to think of it, I\u2019m not really sure why they were crossing the Fold. Seems kind of silly to confront that kind of danger for some animal furs and new maps. Though there was a permanent military base in front of the Fold, so probably these trips occurred semi-regularly. Anyway, they were meant to cross in sand skiffs, powered and defended by Grisha (human wielders of the elements), but not long after they entered the darkness, they were attacked by an unusually large pack of volcra (hideous, flying, man-eating beasts). Death was eminent when a blast of light forced the volcra into retreat, and saved their lives. Can you guess where the blast of light came from? Hmm?? Can you, can you? Well, I\u2019m not telling. *winks* Suffice it to say, that was only the beginning of the deftly created layers-within-layers story of Alina, Mal, and the Darkling (not to mention countless, wonderful secondary characters). The only thing that kept this from being a 5 star read for me was that the thwarting of the bad guy was a bit too deus ex machina for my tastes. Yes, there was foreshadowing that all was not as it seemed, but there were too many conflicts. If the solution was really the solution, then it seems to me that someone should have never been able to do what they did in the first place. Make sense? But ultimately Shadow and Bone was a fantastic read. I loved watching Alina blossom into what she had always been meant to be. I loved the agony of going back and forth between Mal and the Darkling, trying to decide who Alina should choose. I loved Mal and the Darkling b/c they were Mal and the Darkling. And I loved all of these things, and so many more, within Bardugo\u2019s expertly crafted world of Ravka (not to be confused with Russia ). If you\u2019re a fan of YA Fantasy, and dark and creepy things, then Shadow and Bone should be at the top of your reading list. With the final chapter of this trilogy being released in June, there is absolutely no reason to delay. My other reviews for this series: Siege and Storm (The Grisha, #2) Ruin and Rising (The Grisha, #3) ...more \u25c7 First of all this is somewhere between 3 1/2 and 4 stars . \u25c7 Second of all this is nothing like Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom and I was actually surprised that this book was written by Leigh Bardugo bc it was so different! *I didn't read this before SoC and CK.* \u25c7 Third of all The Darkling and I are getting married and you all are invited.

Pls try to wear black, my husband and I would love it. I went into this book not knowing what the heck it was about. I didn't even have any high expectations. (surprise surprise, first time i don't expect things from a book) I also saw so many negative reviews on this and many of my GR friends hating it, however, I, surprisingly enjoyed this so much that I read it in an entire sitting . I know I'm shocked too. And I'm going to admit that I fucking loved this, mostly because of The Darkling, of course. It isn't a solid 5 stars bc there were some things that I didn't like, *cough cough* MAL *cough cough* and some things in this just generally pissed me off. *cough cough* FUCKING MAL . *cough cough* This is our typical YA Fantasy where there is a bad guy and a special snowflake will emerge out of somewhere and help make everything great again. When Alina realizes she has some special all-hail-the-gods- power, The Darkling notices (duh) and takes her under his wing training her for saving the world. While all that happens, Alina also kinda sorta falls for The Darkling, I mean how can she fucking not, but soon she realizes there are some dark secrets about the Grisha that she has to confront. The Characters: Saving the best Darkling for last. Alina Sarkov She was an annoying little bitch, but at the same time I wanted her in The Darkling's bed doing things they aren't supposed to do. She's the typical special snowflake who has the special superpower everyone fears. She's also the typical \"I'm ugly, but obviously the rest of the world looks at me and thinks i'm the prettiest girl ever.\" I would have really found her bearable , but like she's a traitorous bitch and she really pissed me off towards the end. Mal Ugh, oh my fucking shits don't even get me started on how much of a fucking perfect annoying little cunt faced bitch he was . I fucking hate this guy even more than people hate Trump's orange face. \u203bFirst of fucking all, he is a danger to Alina and The Darkling. Shut the fuck up, I don't care how nice or whatever the fuck he is. He is a danger to my ship, I want him dead, six feet under the mother fucking ground . \u203bHe makes every girls ovaries explode. Typical boring shit face with the extremely handsome looks that even the sexy and pretty Grisha girls notice him. I hope you fucking die and get your dick chopped off . God, I fucking hate him. \u203bHis words and love for Alina. Stop right there young Man. Put your dick back in your pants and get the fuck out. No one likes you, stop trying to steal the girl away from The Darkling. I REPEAT GTFO YOU DOG SHIT. The Darkling \u201cThe problem with wanting,\" he whispered, his mouth trailing along my jaw until it hovered over my lips, \"is that it makes us weak.\u201d This is my husband. I love him. We are getting married. Girlies back off please, his darkness belongs to me and you aren't allowed to touch it. He isn't exactly the good guy in the book , but he isn't a bad guy either. OBVIOUSLY HE'S THE GOOD ONE, EVERYONE ELSE IS BAD. He is the all powerful sexy Darkling. Like, this story should've been written from his P.O.V. He is misunderstood and he needs love and people need to see that he's fucking right . I literally loved this book only bc of him. He is sexy and literally just AJKSBDKJLDBFEQ. Fucking slay me, i love him sm it hurts my nonexistent soul. Overall, we have all learned something.

(I\u2019m not going to summarize the plot here, though, because that would take forever AND the book description below is accurate). I really like light fantasy books with creative worlds, magic, fast-moving stories I can get invested in, characters I can connect with, and fun plot twists. This book has everything. And I know people complain about the whole \u201cchosen one\u201d girl with super special powers narrative here, BUT this series takes YA tropes and actually uses them well instead of throwing them in as some kind of checklist. Everything worked! There are very minor spoilers starting now\u2026 I absolutely adore the characters in later books (NIKOLAI IS EVERYTHING) but the best parts of this first book are the worldbuilding and The Darkling. Somehow this series made me sympathize with a mass murderer and actually want him to succeed? I\u2019m usually not someone who blindly supports the villain, either (and I am super reluctant to call him a villain). I was reading this at a time when I was getting pretty tired of overly simplified \u201cdark\u201d characters, so I really appreciated how complex and REAL he ended up being. And for everyone who says this romance happened quickly\u2026 pretty sure he\u2019s meant to be a whole lot more than a love interest? And, no, it\u2019s not a healthy relationship; it\u2019s messy, raw, manipulative, and brilliantly done. I just love how complicated everything gets and how nobody is purely good or evil. No matter how creative fictional worlds get, I still want some basic realistic elements in the relationships. Even the most evil people truly believe they\u2019re doing something positive/helpful, so it was nice to see such vivid characters. So anyways\u2026 back to the rest of the story. There are other wonderful characters besides The Darkling! I really like how the main character has a strong backstory and flaws. Like she doesn\u2019t have the best attitude and makes some poor decisions, but it\u2019s part of what made her relatable. (And these attributes had believable cause, rather than the her just being generally cranky like many other \u201ctough\u201d MCs in books I\u2019ve read lately). Mal was actually a totally lovable character, too! He was just in the unfortunate position of being contrasted with two extremely charismatic characters, so I cared about him the least. There\u2019s also an awesome cast of fun secondary characters and I just loved everyone! But can we just talk about what an amazing writer Leigh Bardugo is?! The authenticity of her word is what really pulled me in. I LOVE medieval fantasy worlds and will never tire of them, but they are all sort of the same. The Grishaverse is seriously unlike anything I\u2019ve ever found and I just love it SO MUCH. It\u2019s this fantasy Russia-type world that feels like it\u2019s been there forever\u2026 and will totally continue doing its thing long after the book ends. The story quickly established a strong sense of history, a class system, and culture, but I think the way the magic works is what really made the world real for me. Like there are clearly defined rules and limits and I really appreciated that! I get really hesitant when a new magic system is introduced in most stories because it usually creates a ton of plot holes or else is just some vague concept that jumps in whenever the story needs a quick save. The magic in this series is really well done\u2026 like there are clearly defined limits to what magic can and cannot do. And all of this is established without an infodump as the story progresses. Hallelujah. Basically, this whole world is amazing. The characters are wonderful. The story is an emotional adventure full of plot twists and drama. The series got even better as it progressed, so if you weren\u2019t completley into the first book maybe hang in there? And if you read Six of Crows first don\u2019t look for an identical story here \u2014 they\u2019re very different but both really fun!! ...more Update: Shadow and Bone is only 99p at Kindle UK!!

(actually, blame it on my bestie, she was the one who said to chuck Shadow and Bone and jump to the good stuff) My overall reaction to this book: Shadow and Bone is narrated from the perspective of the Chosen One Alina Starkov, the poor orphan girl who is pretty bland and has a terrible sense of humour. After her and her squad are attacked on the Fold (this shadowy, scary place where demon bat creatures live), her hidden power bursts through and saves her and her best friend\u2019s life. Alina\u2019s powers lead her to become a trained member of the Grisha (an elite magical sect that are lead by the scary Darkling) where she finds that the entire kingdom is in for a lot of trouble. So there were a lot of annoying tropes in this book. We had: - the \u201cChosen One\u201d -\tthe MC who thinks she ugly and ungifted, while that\u2019s exactly opposite of what she is -\ta dumb, avoidable love triangle -\tan evil one whose not so evil -\tthe \u201cand in this moment I became the hero\u201d \u2013 which happened like two times I\u2019m sad to say that I found no connect to the characters. They all felt very bland and annoying. Alina, the main character, is whining half the time and the other half she\u2019s swooning over the males in her life. #Winning But I will say, that the last 10% of the book was really great. It was exciting and action packed and Alina was tolerable for some time. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, Leigh Bardugo is an incredibly talented author. I\u2019m absolutely enthralled by the Six of Crows series. She has won a place in my eyes as one of the best authors I have read but I think the problem I had with this book was that I was expecting it to be like Six of Crows (despite what everyone said, I just couldn\u2019t help compare them) and that was where the disappointment came. The Ravka world is amazing though. I have to give Leigh credit for her incredible world-building. It all feels so real and tangible and this book does clear up a lot of the technical fog that comes with Six of Crows. But the characters in this book is just lacking whereas in the Six of Crows, the characters are vibrant and lively and so so so so perfect. I\u2019ve probably fallen more in love with the characters than I had with the book. Oh well. Many of my friends have told me that the series does get better and the coming characters make it more interesting, so I\u2019m definitely going to stick around but I think I\u2019ll take a break from this fictional world for now. \u201cAnd there's nothing wrong with being a lizard either.

I read up to page. 108 of Shadow and Bone, but already I'm feeling so pissed off that I need to rant. I don't know why am I so worked up by this book, it's just...sigh. Sigh. SIGH. When I was reading the prologue, everything seemed all right to me, a pair of orphans, a fantasy world based on Russian culture and tradition, what can possibly go so wrong? But right after that prologue, the narration shifts from third person into the female main character, Alina's first person POV. From this point onward I have to endure Alina's narration without any break. And sadly, Alina's voice is very boring and at times, pathetic. (I will get to why I think she's pathetic later) To make things worse, I was then enlightened by other reviewers (for example: LINK ) that Leigh Bardugo named one of her minor characters Ana Kuya, and this name turned out to be a Russian curse word, some reviewers had also mentioned that Bardugo's mistake is just the same like naming an American or British character 'Fuc Kedup' , everyone who knows the language can pick up the joke instantly. Laughable, isn't it? Apparently she had also managed to mess up the Russian male and female last names in her book. For example, the main character's name should be \"Alina Starkova\" instead of \"Alina Starkov\"; because \"Starkov\" is a last name for males; and apparently Bardugo also gave a character a male first name but tagged a female last name behind. And according to these reviewers, such errors could have been easily fixed if only Google Search had been put into some good use. Some readers also claimed that Shadow and Bone *isn't* based on Russian culture, it's only a fantasy book *inspired* by said culture. Really? If this story isn't based on Russian culture, then why are the King and Queen being referred to as tsar and tsaritsa !? What are these Russian words doing here in this 'No! It's so not Russia!' fantasy world!? Today I also came across with another reader's reply to explain how rotten Bardugo's misuse of Russian language and culture really is. And then I also found Leigh Bardugo herself answering the Russian inconsistencies problem on Goodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/... I really, really can't get over Bardugo's naming her character with a Russian curse word and the gender confusion of male and female last names. Come on, you don't have to be a scholar, or read through 10 thick books about Russia or actually do fieldwork in order to get those simple details correct. Just how...can you mess these up when the error could have been easily avoided? That's no excuse. To make things even worse, the more I read the book, more things fail to add up aside from the misuse of those Russian names. Do you remember Alina is supposed to be an orphan who lived off charity offered by a Duke? (and by the way...why would the Duke take orphans in? It isn't even explained. Did he take orphans in so they could join his army later? Zero explanation) Supposedly after she grew up, she joined the First Army as a mapmaker with her childhood best friend, Mal, who was now a handsome young man. You see, Alina is supposed to work for the army and she also claimed that \"Military life had long ago cured me of most of my modesty\" . (page.92) Therefore she is supposed to have the basic military training and discipline, right? Remember, at the beginning of the story, Alina was sent to cross the dangerous Shadow Fold along with other solders, therefore it was hard to imagine she was untrained. But somehow this girl talked and acted like an ordinary teenager who had a pair of spoiling parents, instead of an orphan who had a tough life and having been through quite a numbers of beating. Alina publicly talked back against her superior, she shouted back when someone disturbed her from her sleep. Am I supposed to believe an orphan who had to live off charity and had to be grateful of every meal she had for most of her life to act like this (shouting like a kid) at the first day of her arriving to an entirely new, frightening environment? Furthermore, it really, really doesn't help that Alina talked like an airhead American teenager who lived a carefree, comfortable life in the modern time. To me, shit really hit the fucking fan when Alina came up with this line: \"Great seeing you guys,\" (page. 16) Later, we also have \"Oh well,\" and \"Hey!\" awaited us... (Link: http://vampirekiki.deviantart.com/art... ) Another thing that pisses me off is that Alina just had to be the one and only Sun Summoner (the most powerful among the Grisha) who was the only hope to save the kingdom. My goodness, I am very, very fed up by this \"I'm a plain, overlooked orphan who turns out to be oh-so powerful and important\" childish fantasy in YA novels. Aren't seven Harry Potter novels enough for this fantasy? I don't need more. *sighs* Last but not least, I needed to put the book down and took a few deep breath to calm myself when I read that the reason why Alina thinks she can't be a Grisha is because *she isn't beautiful* , whilst all the Grisha are good-looking? So being beautiful is an important quality of being a warrior!??? How shallow can she be!??? By the way, why would every Grisha be good looking? Must magical power be only possessed by the beautiful people!? The Grisha are soldiers who fight man-eating monsters right? Shouldn't soldiers like this more likely to bear some battle scars or even lose a limb or two? Aside from Alina, there's also the Darkling, who is the leader of the Grisha and the \"second most powerful man in the kingdom\", who is also supposed to be around 120 years old. But it turns out the Darkling isn't all that cunning nor capable, I honestly think that if the Darkling is the second most powerful person in the kingdom, then no wonder this fictional kingdom is in so much troubles. (By the way, why would a powerful figure allow himself to be called 'the Darkling'? Why don't call himself High Magician or Royal Magician etc?) I mean, so far the Darkling did not act like he was a careful, cunning person at all. For example, he did nothing to prepare Alina before she was to be presented to the King and the entire court---what makes him think this untrained girl wouldn't mess up in front of the whole court and spoil his important demonstration of discovering a Sun Summoner!? Plus, shouldn't the Darkling have spent the various days to prepare Alina when they traveled across lands to reach the palace!? And tell me, what kind of intelligent man would allow the very important Sun Summoner to wander alone in front of all those nobles? Why the Darkling didn't even bother to send a trusted guard to watch over her, especially when there had already been two attempts at her life!? REALLY, SERIOUSLY? Ms. Bardugo, I afraid you're on your way to join Colleen Houck, Amanda Hocking and Stephenie Meyer in my 'Most Shitty, Lazy Authors List'. Actual review starts here: In Mistborn: The Final Empire , the first book of Brandon Sanderson's Misborn trilogy, a man took in an orphan girl and told her \"You have special power, and I also have special power, you and I are going to change the world!\" Turns out it has to take no less than 200 pages, and a lot of effort from the man's part, for the orphaned girl to grow some basic trust toward her teacher/mentor, turns out it has taken another 400 pages before the orphaned girl to have complete faith in her mentor and embraced her mentor's mission as her own. So what happens in Shadow and Bone after a man tells an orphaned girl: \"You have special power, and I also have special power, you and I are going to change the world!\" ? Turns out in this book, the man doesn't have to try very hard to convince the orphaned girl. A handsome face, a smile, a few kind words and a few vague promise are enough to buy the girl's trust. The orphaned girl then goes into training to become the most powerful magic user in some magical boarding school. She meets new people and things happen all around her, but she hardly learns anything of importance, she never gathers information and forms a thought of her own; instead she allows decisions to be made for her. Turns out the girl hardly actually does anything, in this book with a good 356 pages. There're many things the orphaned girl should have done, but sadly she had done none of them. I didn't expect Alina to be the smartest teenager or a Wonder Woman, but I did expect her to keep her eyes and ears wide open after she was taken to the palace, I want her to ask questions, to gather new knowledge and information and come up with a thought and a decision of her own; I want her to study hard to control her own power. Sadly, Alina does none of these things. She believes in everything other people tell her, she complains constantly about her teachers being demanding on her and how sore she is after practices, she refers one of her teachers as 'a spiteful old woman' in her mind and highlighted the other teacher as a stereotyped warlike, barbaric Chinaman (Yup, the Shu Han Empire is clearly based on China or Mongolia; but 'Han' is usually associated with China or the Han Chinese group). I am sorry? Aren't those teachers being demanding on you because you're the fucking last hope of the entire kingdom, Alina? For goodness' sake! Give me a break! Wait, you don't know what this Chinaman complain is about? Then let me explain it to you more clearly: in Bardugo's fictional world, there's an unfriendly neighbor country which looks suspiciously like China. This country is called 'Shu Han' in the book; I want to point out 'Shu Han' is the name of an actually existed and well known ancient Chinese kingdom. This kingdom is probably most well known for being featured in Romance of the Three Kingdoms , a Chinese historical novel based on the events that took place in the Three Kingdoms era. Now it looks like Ms. Bardugo just Wiki-ed 'Chinese history' and picked up the name of Shu Han. Now I understand why my friend called Shadow and Bone a \"lazyass book\". Wait a second! I had forgotten that Alina did have her doubts about her power and she did ask questions now and then, but sadly her doubts and questions are all about: \"Oh! Every Grisha is beautiful! How can I be one of them when I'm so, PLAIN!?\" I. Can't. Handle. This. Bullshit! I. Just. Can't. Do you know what I'm thinking? Shadow and Bone tries to disguise itself as a 'high fantasy' novel, but in reality this book reads like some high school paranormal melodrama: we have an orphan going to a magical boarding school, then dramas with training and the mean-spirited Queen Bee, a love triangle and last but not least......WE JUST HAVE TO HAVE THE PLAIN-JANE MAIN GIRL DOLLING UP NICELY THEN GOING TO THE winter ball PROM NIGHT DANCE SO EVERYONE CAN SEE HOW AWESOME SHE REALLY IS. It's just great, right? If you had read high school paranormal melodramas in other YA novels before, you can just skip this book. I mean it. Secondly I want to talk about the Darkling. To me, Alina seems to fear the Darkling, she has been constantly worrying about the consequence of displeasing him and you know what? For once, she actually isn't a complete fool, because she does have reasons to be fearful and on guard. Whenever the Darkling interacts with Alina, I can't see he has any concern or affection toward Alina outside of her usefulness of being the precious Sun Summoner. Nape. However, it all has changed in the middle of the book, when (view spoiler) [ all of a sudden Alina thinks Mal, her best friend, has abandoned her and now she's in love with the Darkling and he loves her in return? (hide spoiler) ] Can things get any more forced and unconvincing here? Finally, I believe the ending also deserve a mention here. To be frank, if the ending isn't so much of a letdown, I may have given this book a three stars. But no, even till the end, other people (Mal, the Darkling, etc) have to tell Alina what she should do. My goodness, I want Alina to make up her own mind, but she just refuses to do it till the end. And when she does make a decision in the end, her decision only makes it very clear that she's not any better than the bad guys. I wouldn't say too much about the ending and I don't think the disastrous consequence is entirely Alina's fault, but still...an ending like this is very difficult to swallow. Okay, I will tell you what happens in the end, (view spoiler) [Alina left a bunch of people in the middle of the Shadow Fold, she left them to face the man-eating monsters, she basically left them for death as she saved Mal and escaped with him, after that I lost all respect toward her. She is no better than The Darkling. (hide spoiler) ] I gave this book two stars simply because it's easy to read, and the writing is slightly better than the hot messes which awful YA authors such as Colleen Houck, Amanda Hocking and Stephenie Meyer have to offer, but that's all. If you were looking for YA novels with realistic characters, strong heroine, exciting plots and believable plot twists; look somewhere else.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more Everything, i love everything about this book. i finished it at 5 AM i stayed up all night reading, it's total page-turner and because *duuh* it's Leigh Bardugo. i LOVED a lot of quotes in this book, some of them are minor spoilers so please if you haven't read the book don't read my review. My favorite Quotes: \"Fine, Make me your villain\" Before Mal, Keramzin had been a place of terrors, long nights spent crying in the dark, older children who ignored me, cold and empty rooms. But then Mal arrived Everything, i love everything about this book. i finished it at 5 AM i stayed up all night reading, it's total page-turner and because *duuh* it's Leigh Bardugo. i LOVED a lot of quotes in this book, some of them are minor spoilers so please if you haven't read the book don't read my review. My favorite Quotes: \"Fine, Make me your villain\" Before Mal, Keramzin had been a place of terrors, long nights spent crying in the dark, older children who ignored me, cold and empty rooms. But then Mal arrived and all of that changed. The dark hallways became places to hide and play. The lonely woods became places to explore. Keramzin became our palace, our kingdom, and I wasn\u2019t afraid anymore. But the Grisha Examiners would have taken me from Keramzin. They would have taken me away from Mal, and he had been the only good thing in my world. So I\u2019d made my choice. I\u2019d pushed my power down and held it there each day, with all my energy and will, without ever realizing it. I\u2019d used up every bit of myself to keep that secret. I remembered standing at the window with Mal, watching the Grisha depart in their troika, how tired I\u2019d felt. The next morning, I\u2019d woken to find dark circles beneath my eyes. They\u2019d been with me ever since. And now? I asked myself, pressing my forehead against the cool wood of the door, my whole body shaking. Now Mal had left me behind. The only person in the world who truly knew me had decided I wasn\u2019t worth the effort of a few words. But I was holding on still. Despite all the luxuries of the Little Palace, despite my newfound powers, despite Mal\u2019s silence, I held on. Baghra was right. I\u2019d thought I was making such an effort, but deep down, some part of me just wanted to go home to Mal. Some part of me hoped that this had all been a mistake, that the Darkling would realize his error and send me back to the regiment, that Mal would realize how much he\u2019d missed me, that we\u2019d grow old together in our meadow. Mal had moved on, but I was still standing frightened before those three mysterious figures, holding tight to his hand. It was time to let go. That day on the Shadow Fold, Mal had saved my life, and I had saved his. Maybe that was meant to be the end of us. The thought filled me with grief, grief for the dreams we\u2019d shared, for the love I\u2019d felt, for the hopeful girl I would never be again. That grief flooded through me, dissolving a knot that I hadn\u2019t even known was there. I closed my eyes, feeling tears slide down my cheeks, and I reached out to the thing within me that I\u2019d kept hidden for so long. I\u2019m sorry, I whispered to it. I\u2019m sorry I left you so long in the dark. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m ready now. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it took me so long to see you, Alina. But I see you now.\u201d \u201cThey are orphans again, with no true home but each other and whatever life they can make together on the other side of the sea.\u201d \u201cI'm not like you, Mal.
