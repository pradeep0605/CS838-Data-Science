Now that that\u2019s out of the way..... Gah, I don\u2019t know if I have the words to describe how brilliant this book was! This entire series has been nothing but a heart-wrenching, roller coaster ride of emotions and events from the very beginning, and it all came to a gripping conclusion that was more or less....utterly perfect! This is my all time fave series. I\u2019ve never loved a book series as much as I love VA and going into this book I knew it was going to be spectacular. It seems like I,<---M> and all the other fans</---M>, have waited forever after the nail biting ending of Spirit Bound and I\u2019m soooo happy to say that I wasn\u2019t disappointed. From the very beginning the story drew me in. I was gobsmacked with a few of the twists and left gaping throughout the whole book. I literally couldn\u2019t put it down and from start to finish it was practically super glued to my fingers. I read it in one sitting! It was an electricity charged ride and I was desperate to know how Rose was going to get herself out of her current predicament the entire way! From the very moment Dimitri, Adrian and Eddie broke Rose outta jail, a plan orcastrated by Lissa, Christian and Abe, I might add, I was gone.....Nothing and no one could have stopped me reading. Honestly, my house could have been on fire and I wouldn\u2019t have noticed....nor would I have moved until I\u2019d finished reading. Actually, come to think of it.....do I smell smoke? *sniff* *sniff*...... All the characters I\u2019ve come to love and adore were here in all their glory. Rose, Dimitri, Lissa, Christian, Adrian, <---C>Sydney</---C>, Eddie, Abe, Rose\u2019s mum, Jill..... I could go on and on.....they were all there and it was great to see them again. Rose and Dimitri sitting in a tree...K-I-S-S-...oh, whatever....THEY GOT BACK TOGETHER!!! Yay!*does happy dance* I\u2019m so happy right now I can\u2019t even put it into words. After everything they\u2019ve been through, after all the torment and challenges, they\u2019ve finally gotten to the point when they see that they\u2019re soul mates, that they\u2019re meant for each other...something we\u2019ve all known for quite a while. I love Adrian, I do and it breaks my heart that his and Rose\u2019s relationship had to end the way it did (Rose...seriously, I\u2019d shake you for cheating if I wasn\u2019t so happy you and Dimka are back together), but I just can\u2019t deny that I feel like this is the right outcome. Totally. Completely. Rose tried to give her relationship with Adrian a shot, but it just wasn\u2019t right. I\u2019m glad Dimitri finally came to his senses in this book and admitted that he still loved Rose (like that was a secret *rolls eyes*) and that they are going to be together for real. I really feel sorry for Adrian though. I\u2019m really disappointed that Rose cheated on him; I do feel like she should be better than that. But I understand that people make mistakes and we can\u2019t help how our hearts feel. I just feel like Adrian got the raw end of the stick. Dimitri always had Rose\u2019s heart, let\u2019s face it, and I think Adrian deserves to find a girl who will give her whole heart to him and only him. He needs someone to love him that can help him be the best person he can be. And I\u2019m really hoping he finds that in the spin off series, because I don\u2019t feel like his story has been told. It\u2019s not completed. Jill was Lissa\u2019s sibling. I will say that I did see that one coming. It\u2019s something that I think is both obvious and yet it\u2019s not.....it\u2019s a great little sub twist. She\u2019s been under everyone\u2019s noses the whole time. Lissa had a sibling right there at St Vladimir\u2019s and no one knew about it. Totally cool! The only thing I don\u2019t like was how Lissa reacted to Jill. Yes, I get that it was a shock....one hell of a shock....but I also think she could have been a little more inviting and friendlier to her new found sister. Still..... Tasha! It was freaking Tasha!! Never once did I think she could be capable of something like murdering the Queen. She always seemed like such a cool person, an ally. I certainly didn\u2019t think that she\u2019d be the killer, even though I did see her motive beforehand. I just thought she was on Rose\u2019s side, not that she was the one that set her up. But I can see why she did it. I guess I always thought her feelings towards Dimitri were never that strong. I\u2019m thrilled that Lissa became queen. I think it\u2019s a very good progression and evolution of the story. I think that she is the best person to help the Moroi move forward and I hope that takes effect in the spin off series. And Rose is Lissa\u2019a guardian and Dimitri is Christian\u2019s. Is that not perfect or what?!? Rhetorical question, don\u2019t answer that.....of course it is! Now they can be together and still do their jobs and duty. Lord, this book was wonderful. I just can\u2019t say it enough! I really can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what people are going to say, but I\u2019m incredibly happy with this book. I feel like everything we\u2019ve been through in the whole series has led to this moment, this ending, and I think it\u2019s very fitting. However, I also feel that there were a few loose ends left. A few possibilities that I believe are going to be the focus of the spin off series Bloodlines. First off I want to see what happens to Adrian. I think he more than anyone else deserves some kind of happiness. I want him to find someone and I\u2019m still holding on to my hope that that person will be Sydney. I think that despite her notions of dhampirs, he is more than capable of changing her feelings. I think he\u2019s charming enough to sweep her off her feet. That is unless that other Alchemist Ian doesn\u2019t do it. That\u2019s something I\u2019ll be watching. I want to know what's going to happen to Eddie since he killed that Moroi. How much is that moment going to effect his life? And I\u2019d really love to see how Lissa goes as Queen and what happens to Jill. I want the two of them to get to know one another and bond. And now.... It\u2019s over *sob* *sob* I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s actually over! I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do with myself not that it\u2019s finished, I really don\u2019t. This series has been the best I\u2019ve ever read. Throughout Rose\u2019s journey I\u2019ve smiled, laughed, practically cried when a certain Guardian became a Strigoi *cough* Dimitri *cough* and enjoyed almost every single moment, bar a few.... and again I head back to when a certain Guardian became a Strigoi. There\u2019s been the ups and downs, the happy moments and the oh so sad ones, and I feel like the ending, the conclusion, makes all those moments when I wanted to scream out loud (and often did) or cry because everything just seemed so horrible.....totally and utterly worth it! <---A>Richelle Mead</---A> has created a treasure here and I recommend this series with more heart and soul than I possibly have!!!! ...more Complete and Edited Book Review....down there somewhere ***Thoughts before Reading*** (Just scroll down little dhampir^^) Okay the last book of the series... Wondering what \"<+++>Last Sacrifice</+++>\" means??? My speculations on who kills the Queen, I think it's probably Victor Dashkov since he is free now or maybe one of the royals I bet it's Adrian's father. I'm Team Adrian, but if it's going to be like Twilight, then Rose and Dimitri would be together at the end, I'd just hope something happens like Dimitri Complete and Edited Book Review....down there somewhere ***Thoughts before Reading*** (Just scroll down little dhampir^^) Okay the last book of the series... Wondering what \"<+++>Last Sacrifice</+++>\" means??? My speculations on who kills the Queen, I think it's probably Victor Dashkov since he is free now or maybe one of the royals I bet it's Adrian's father. I'm Team Adrian, but if it's going to be like Twilight, then Rose and Dimitri would be together at the end, I'd just hope something happens like Dimitri die or whatever lol. I think if they find Lissa half-brother/sister, then she'll be the next queen for the Moroi Society. I bet Rose will be a fugitive and Abe's the one would help her. I just wish the ending would not be too much of a happy ending like what happens in Breaking Dawn, when they don't fight in the battle so no one major dies. ***Thoughts after Reading This One*** Note: First I'd like to say that I'm really confused on how to rate this one thus I have two ratings. If I will base it just on pure emotions alone or how I felt about the book in general I will rate this one star. However, if I put my emotions aside and judge the book rationally I will have given it a five star. But I favor my emotions rather my reasoning so it has a one star rating displayed up there. But just to be cleared I repeat that this is a one and five star book at the same time. And then there will be SPOILERS, Fudge these SPOILERS! Note: Skim this one, this is just a crazy letter, bear in mind that I'm still emotional. Dear Self, I hate you. I really hate you!!! Why, why are you always like this? Why do you always side on the second guy in a love triangle? Is that a sickness of yours or something? First in Twilight you're Team Jacob right? And didn't you ever learn your lesson in that that the second guy will always be fucked up by the heroine in the end. That they will just be trashed and dumped out like stupid piece of shit! But you always team up with them don't you? You still always most often than not love the second guy rather than the main guy right? You pissed me off. Look you already know how it will end (Are you really that dumb?) since this one is what exactly happens in Eclipse too! But what did you do? You still hope and have that wishful thinking that Adrian and Rose will end up together. That Dimka will die. That Rose and Adrian will end up having little dhampir babies and that will be the solution to their dhampir-will-be-extinct problem. But girl you're so wrong don't you? Because Richelle Mead broke your heart into microscopic pieces of myocardial cells! Rose not only break up with Adrian, but she cheated on him. She had sex with Dimka even before breaking up with Adrian! What an irony is it right? You're crying and losing your mind reading a sex scene because of the reason that you felt cheated too! And now you still don't learn do you? You still would have those naive fantasies that Puck and Meghann will end up in Iron King Series, Bianca and Balthazar will be together in Evernight Series and Jem and Tessa in Infernal Devices series. Please it will never ever be a possibility, so I beg you don't fool yourself into thinking about it! Sincerely yours, Evil Alter Ego ******************************************************* The Five Stages of Grief as Applied to my Dilemma Note: Please don\u2019t take this seriously. It\u2019s only fictional. Denial : Friend: Hey have you read the Last Sacrifice? Self: Yeah Friend: Really, do you like it that Rose and Dimka ended up together? Self: What? Have we read the same book? Rose and Adrian ended up together! GEEEEZ! Anger Friend: Hey are you okay? Self: I\u2019m not okay! I felt I want to punch Dimitri and Rose in the face if that will ever be possible! I\u2019m so angry right now! Really Dimitri and Rose go to hell! I can\u2019t even believe that Rose cheated on Adrian! What the hell\u2019s wrong with that woman? I really want to kill her! Gggggggrrrrrrrrrrrr...... *attacks someone innocent who happens to pass by* Bargaining Friend: Hey what are you doing? Self: I\u2019m writing a letter to Richelle Mead, don\u2019t bother me! Friend: Huh I thought you\u2019re angry at her last book. Why are you writing to her then? Self: I just say to her that if she will change her last book I will be her servant forever and I\u2019m going to clean her house and wash her laundry and cook for her, you know the usual stuff. Just, just change all the things she wrote in the last book and make Adrian and Rose ended up together. Friend: What the hell! You\u2019re kidding right? Self: No! I\u2019m dead serious! Friend: *nervous laugh* ah okay *walks out of the room* Depression Friend: Hey do you want to go out tonight! Self: I don\u2019t want to do anything *cries and hugs friend* Friend: What, what\u2019s wrong? Self: I don\u2019t want to live knowing that Rose and Adrian don\u2019t end up together. I just wanted to cry all day long. Friend: Hey you are still not through with Rose and Adrian not ending up together? Come on girl where\u2019s your back bone? Move on, get a life already! Self: I can\u2019t. I simply can\u2019t. *cries and wails* Acceptance Friend: Wow someone looks happy today. You look good are you through with the drama huh? Self: Yeah shut up! *shoves friend* I\u2019m feeling okay now, I think Rose and Dimitri deserve each other, right now I really don\u2019t care about them. Friend: But what about Adrian huh? You still felt mad about what happen to him. Self: Hell no! I think Rose didn\u2019t deserve him, you know what I think I should just keep Adrian to myself. Rose can go to hell with Dimitri, Adrian is MINE, thank you Rose for giving him up to me! We deserve each other more! Friend: What? It\u2019s a good thing you get past that but seriously friend, I think you have another problem, you now have delusions! *************************************************************** Book Review (Finally! I think this should be my longest review ever, why the hell are there so many intros? O_o) Let start with the good stuff... Why-oh-why the 5 star rating? 1. The cover\u2019s gorgeous, that\u2019s a plus! 2. The title was also good \u201cLast Sacrifice\u201d though I really don\u2019t get what the hell is the so-called \u201cLast Sacrifice\u201d in this book. Please someone explain that to me on the comment section. 3. Rose POV is sarcastic, witty and funny as always that it never fails to crack me up. 4. Abe Mazur was funny as hell as always. 5. Sydney the alchemist was backed. 6. We get to go to different places, like the community of the Keepers, Sonya\u2019s crib, etc. 7. The Politics! Gosh I love all of that! The election of the new Moroi Queen and Lissa\u2019s tests are really exciting and different as she pass onto another level, like there\u2019s a test for physical, emotional and intellectual. 8. I love the final test; the question was like, \u201cWhat must a queen possess in order to truly rule her people?\u201d And actually Lissa\u2019s answer to that shocked me and I love it. 9. I love Lissa in this book I think she had that sort of character development in this one. I kind of underestimated her because in the previous books I really thought that she was a weak character, but in this one she really did grow and I believe that she\u2019ll be an amazing queen. 10. I also love Sonya Karp I think she has all that wonderful quotes in the book and I was really glad that she and Mikhail finally reunite. 11. I also love Christian in this one even though I missed his firefighting coolness. All of his scenes were like a good \u2018ol boyfriend to Lissa, but at least those happens to be sweet moments in this book that all of a sudden I really wanted to be Lissa. 12. I really love the murder mystery aspect of the book, I must admit that tuuuut as the Queen\u2019s murderer was not that really shocking since someone already spoiled it to me in the comment section *coughs* (lol I\u2019m just kidding) but seriously as you go along the book there were clues that actually you really would have guessed that tuuuut was the one who did it. 13. Okay let\u2019s talk about Lissa\u2019s sister, that kind of shock me because I really thought that what they will meet was a new character of the story, but it was tuuuuut(OMG) though yeah I was kind of happy about it because I kind of love her from the previous books. 14. OMG Tuuuuuut died and tuuuut killed her because she kinda lost herself because of Spirit-induced anger. I think it was quite shocking but I really don\u2019t care about it because I really think that character deserved to die anyway. 15. Victor and Robert team up with Rose\u2019s team I think that was also surprising and thrilling at the same time. I also love the part when they fight and like Sonya use Spirit and then Robert uses spirit too and Victor uses earth. It was pretty epic like an anime fight scene. 16. Yeah in general I did think that this was an amazing book and an amazing series (just minus the Adrian part). It was fast-paced, full of twist and turns, the characters are all great, it was thrilling and just simply amazing. Why-oh-why the one star rating? 1. Rose cheated on Adrian. Really Rose out of all the people! (T_T) you\u2019re unbelievable!( I would like to share some passages from the book, that really made me want to rip the book in half) Page 417: We touched in no other way, but his hand held all the warmth in the world. This was hardly a perfect moment, like in the library, but our familiar connection and the understanding between us burned brighter than ever, and it felt good. Right. Natural. I didn\u2019t want to sleep. I just wanted to stay there and savor being with him. It wasn\u2019t cheating, I decided, thinking of Adrian. It was just enjoying this closeness. ***Oh really Rose? Fudge you!*** Note: this next scene happen after Dimitri and Rose had sex. Page 488: Regardless, I couldn\u2019t lead him on after sleeping with Dimitri. It hadn\u2019t been murder, no, but it had certainly dishonourable. Yet...I couldn\u2019t say any of that to Adrian now, I realized. I couldn\u2019t break up with him in a dream. That was almost as bad as a text breakup. Besides, I had a feeling that...well, I\u2019d probably need his help. So much for honor. Soon , I swore. Soon I\u2019ll tell him ***Rose you\u2019re the worst living creature ever! (T_T) You\u2019re not only a cheater, but a liar and a user as well!*** 2. Worst break-up in the history of my reading books ever! Page577:\u201dI loved you!\u201d he yelled. He jumped up out of his chair so quickly I never saw it coming. \u201cI loved you, and you destroyed me. You took my heart and ripped it up. You might as well have staked me!\u201d The change in his features also caught me by surprise. His voice filled the room. So much grief, so much anger. So unlike the usual Adrian . He strode toward me, hand clasped over his chest. \u201cI. Loved. You. And you used me the whole time.\u201d ***WTF! This kills me! (T_T)*** I really hate this! I hate Rose and Dimitri! If I ever saw Dimitri in person I\u2019m going to do this Calm down, calm down, calm down... Okay so much for drama, I just want to say that I still love the series and I still love Richelle Mead (though you did break my heart) and I\u2019ll still wait for the sequel to come out and for the movie as well. This btw is what I imagine Adrian will be: ...more I should preface my review by stating that I only read this book because I was given a copy by a very good friend of mine. I read it because I wanted to know how it all ended and to be done with the series. I had no good expectations of this book because I was less than impressed with Blood Promises and despised Spirit Bound. People in love with this series should stop reading about now. Because, to be honest, reading this book was like reading an alcoholic unicorn chucking-up rainbows while smal I should preface my review by stating that I only read this book because I was given a copy by a very good friend of mine. I read it because I wanted to know how it all ended and to be done with the series. I had no good expectations of this book because I was less than impressed with Blood Promises and despised Spirit Bound. People in love with this series should stop reading about now. Because, to be honest, reading this book was like reading an alcoholic unicorn chucking-up rainbows while small children clap. If that sounds kind of awesome then I think life may not have been kind to you. I should also preface by saying that I am neither Team Adrian nor Team Dimitri, though I am most certainly Team Shut-The-Hell-Up-Rose! Every big problem I have with the series shows up in this book and it is fuelled by Mead's juvenile love of infantile plot and soap-opera worthy melodrama. For one, Rose, who I had believed to be a half-decent character even by the end of Blood Promises, continues her nose-dive into craptastic whore and regular pain-in-the-arse-brat. I have heard several times that she \u2018grows\u2019 in this book. Unless these people are on a measuring scale comparable to the rate of growth for the shifting of giant fucking glaciers over a matter of hours, then I think some people are deluding themselves. You know, I don\u2019t even mind a bratty character as long as it\u2019s obvious by the surrounding text, story, and supporting characters that she is a giant brat who deserves to get bitch slapped. Preferably by Wayne Brady. However, everyone in this series fawns over Rose as if she\u2019s the second coming of the butt-kicking messiah and she is constantly praised as a hero of legendary proportions who is kind, caring, selfless and always there for others. Rose\u2019s minor, trivial and easily forgotten concerns over the lives she\u2019s ruined to achieve her ends are quickly dismissed at the end of the story. No. Rose Hathaway doesn\u2019t ruin lives. She saves them. She doesn\u2019t demand people give up their only daughter to a life of vicious court politics just so her best friend gets a freakin\u2019 council vote. She doesn\u2019t expect her friends to jeopardize their careers to help her with her love life/criminal career only to ditch them immediately after because, hey, their concerns aren\u2019t her concerns. She doesn\u2019t heartlessly cheat on her boyfriend, acknowledge to herself that it\u2019s a bad time to dump him because he could still be useful and then later tell him off for being a victim in her great dumping speech. Nooo\u2026er, wait. Yeah, she does do all of that. Then, of course, is Rose\u2019s great love of public speaking which, once again, pops up in this book. Christian: Hey Rose, did you ever think it might be a good idea to tell the authorities and your friends about who the killer is first, in private, so that some of them aren't publicly humiliated and embarrassed while having their world pulled out from under them in front of hundreds of people? Rose: Er\u2026 Christian: Yeah, that\u2019s what I thought\u2026 The girl needs to line up at the Ministry of Ridiculous Speeches (right next to the Ministry of Silly Walks) to get public funding every time the council is stupid enough to let her have free reign on a mic. Which, by the way, has so far been pretty much EVERY time. You\u2019d think they would have learned by now and Kung Fu\u2019d her vocal chords before she could open her stupid mouth at a public function. There is of course, someone more annoying. In fact, he's so annoying that he almost makes you feel SORRY for Rose. Which, when you think about it, is comparable to making you feel bad for King Henry VIII for having to kill so many of his wives in order to get a son. Have I mentioned before that this guy is particularly dickish? Look, Dimitri, I know that in Soviet Russia, things are done differently, okay? [image error] But things are different in America. I\u2019m going to give you a scenario of what Rose SHOULD have done, just so that you can see how badly you fuck up as a romantic interest. \u201cRose,\u201d Dimitri murmured, his hand caressing her cheek after a seriously kick-arse battle in which evil has been defeated and Rose and Dimitri fought like they were having a sex metaphor. \u201cYour hair is beautiful\u2026 and I care for you.\u201d Rose\u2019s eyes lit up. Finally, this is what she\u2019s been waiting for. After all the heart ache, all the disappointment, all of the dashed-dreams! \u201cReally, Dimitri? Do you think maybe\u2026 can you love again?\u201d Dimitri\u2019s gaze drops and his features stiffen as flakes of snow drop around them in some crazy literary metaphor for dramatic tension. \u201cWe can\u2019t talk about it. It\u2019s not right.\u201d Rose stops, her face screwing into annoyance. \u201cWhat do you mean we can\u2019t talk about it? Why can\u2019t we talk about it?\u201d He turns away, with a flash of cold eyes. His shoulders are stiff and his voice is chilling. \u201cNothing. We have to go.\u201d Rose\u2019s jaw drops and she stares at him in disbelief. \u201cIf we can\u2019t talk about it then why the fuck did you bring it up?\u201d Dimitri glances back in confusion. \u201cWhat do you mean, Rose? Er\u2026 not that we should be talking about this or anything\u2026 but, really, what do you mean?\u201d Rose crosses her arms over her chest, shaking her head in disbelief. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk about it then stop getting me into sexually charged situations and making mysterious comments about how beautiful I am. It\u2019s kind of unfair, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Dimitri stares into her face with a blank expression, shock colouring his features into stupid disbelief. Finally, he stammers and coughs. \u201cWe really shouldn\u2019t talk about this. It isn\u2019t right\u2026\u201d Rose huffs, flips him the bird and walks off. \u201cRight. I\u2019m going to go have mind-blowing, awesome, earth-shattering sex with Adrian. Fuck you, wanker!\u201d You see what you did there, Dimitri? You\u2019re an asswipe. Even the guys from Jersey Shore think you\u2019re a dick. Finally, my biggest problem with this book is that Mead\u2019s writing is over-commercialized dog-shit that has been lazily written, terribly edited and slapped together all in the name of making a quick buck. The ridiculous typos alone in this book were offensive to the reader. I wasn\u2019t even in editing mode and I counted seventeen typos. That\u2019s not counting the grammatical errors I found when I actually looked. Clearly producing a well-edited, quality product was nowhere near as important as slapping a dramatic cover on the front and shipping out this mess. ...more *Heavy Sigh* This review and more of a rant that contains spoilers, so consider yourself warned\u2026 Just mustering up the details of this book in order to write a synopsis takes extreme effort.

This is what you need to know. Lissa, Abe, Christian, Adrian, Eddie, Mikhail, and Dimitri break Rose out of jail. Rose then escapes court with Dimitri where they latter meet up with Sydney who is being blackmailed by Abe to assist Rose and keep her hidden until he, Lissa, Christian, Adrian, and Co. can clear Rose\u2019s tainted name. While Rose, Dimitri and Sydney stay hidden, Rose manages to do the following things (aside from lusting after Dimitri while mentally telling herself she is over him): \u2022\tDream walk with Victor. Naturally, Rose being an impulsive dumbass, tells him her exact location, plans to find the last Dragomir (Lissa\u2019s half-sibling) and later clues she has uncovered about said half sibling. \u2022\tFind Sonya Karp, her former teacher, who turned strigoi in order to stave off the effects of spirit, as she supposedly knows the identity of Lissa\u2019s long lost sibling. Sydney discovered this while searching bank records. \u2022\tNow that Rose and Victor are bosom buddies, Victor has his brother Robert heal Sonya with spirit to turn her back into a Moroi so that she will have to tell them the secret identity of Lissa\u2019s long lost sibling. \u2022\tRose and Co learn that Jill is the long lost sibling. They go to find her, and Victor, true to form kidnaps her. That was a huge surprise\u2026..not. \u2022\tRose rescues Jill and kills Victor, and then proceeds to feel very bad about it, but only for three pages. \u2022\tRose and Dimitri do it, while she is still with Adrian I might add, but don\u2019t worry, it isn\u2019t cheating, because she mentally dumped Adrian before she dropped her knickers. Meanwhile, back at court: \u2022\tLissa has been nominated as a candidate to become queen. \u2022\tShe takes a series of tests to become queen, which we are privy to via Rose\u2019s ability to snap into her mind. Naturally, Lissa passes all of them. \u2022\tLissa and Co. play detective, questioning Ambrose and a few others. They uncover a series of very lame clues, that all point to the red herring, Daniella, Adrian\u2019s mother. With Jill in tow, Rose, Dimitri, and the now reformed Sonya Karp head back to court, where Rose exposes herself, Jill\u2019s identity and the name of Tatiana\u2019s murderer, who is revealed to be Tasha Ozera, Christian\u2019s aunt. Naturally she does this in a crowded room, because heaven forbid she find a thoughtful way to break the news to her best friend that her dad was a cheating feign who spawned an illegitimate sibling or to her best friends\u2019 man, that his aunt is a murdering loon? But tactful as ever Rose breaks this gut wrenching news as eloquently as a charging bull, and everyone takes her word for it, because who wouldn\u2019t trust a lying, conniving, impulsive 18 year old girl? Tasha of course goes on a psychotic rampage, even though her character has been thoughtful and intelligent thus far, and attempts to shoot Lissa. Luckily Rose jumps in front of her just in time. * It is here that I paused to pray that Rose would die*. Sadly, my prayers were not answered, Rose lives, and as an added benefit, her \u201cbond\u201d to Lissa is severed. Rose is now her own person, no longer linked to spirit. I don\u2019t understand how or why, but there ya go. In the last few pages, Adrian confronts Rose for being a cheater and basically calls her a manipulative, lying, user and abuser, and wishes her a life of misery, after all, because of Rose, Eddie may never work again, Jill is now bound to court politics, where her life will be in constant peril, and Sydney is now locked in alchemist prison. In spite of the carnage, Rose believes Adrian\u2019s accusations are unjust, and paints his willingness to cast himself in the role of victim as the cause for his outburst. I will say this, I envy Rose for her ego. Lastly we learn that Rose has been assigned as guardian to Lissa, who is now queen, and Dimitri will be guardian to Christian. They all live happily ever after. Qualms: \u2022\tThe consistent break in cannon. Rose was able to communicate with Tatiana while in jail at court through the spirit ether, when in previous books; court was her only relief from the spirit induced hallucinations due to its heavily warded state. \u2022\tTasha Ozera as the killer. Come on, talk about a bitch move on Mead\u2019s part. The woman\u2019s got a burnt off face, a tainted family name, and lost the man she loved to a spoiled, whorish-17 year old. \u2022\tThe lack of Christian, or even Eddie for that matter. Characters who weren\u2019t introduced until book 4 play a larger role than these fan favorites. Probably because Mead lacks the skills to write such a convoluted, wonky story with the characters she already had in place. \u2022\tThe ease with which Rose discovers Jill\u2019s identity. Seriously, it took all of ten pages when you cut the filler. That\u2019s bogus. How would such a lame cover up have survived 15 years? And if it was that easy for Rose, why wasn\u2019t it that easy for queen Tatiana, who had endless resources? \u2022\tRose and Dimitri\u2019s relationship. Seriously, it was bull shit, all this, I love you but can\u2019t be with you because I used to be evil crap. Then Rose later pretending she isn\u2019t obsessed with Dimitri while obsessing over Dimitri. Not to mention that when the relationship started, it was illegal in most states. \u2022\tThe inclusion of the Keepers, who\u2019s purpose to this story remains to be seen, yet they take up at least 100 pages of this book. \u2022\tMead\u2019s inability to further mention Dimitri\u2019s family, who were made oh so important in book 4 only to never be heard from or seen again. \u2022\tOn that note, there was no mention of Mia either. \u2022\tOr those pesky tarot card readings that seemed so like portents\u2026 \u2022\tAnd I have yet to decipher who or what the last sacrifice was\u2026Tasha maybe? She was certainly thrown under the bus. \u2022\tLast but not least, Rose the Harlot. Not only did this asshole of a character fail to develop, she digressed to the lowest of the low, and yet we readers are supposed to think she is fantastic. I\u2019m at a complete loss as to why this deplorable character has so many fans. She complained for 5 books about how much she secretly resented Lissa\u2019s dependence on her, and when Lissa exerts her independence to not only take care of herself, but Rose too, Rose complains. Then there is her treatment of Adrian. Adrian risks his life to protect her, and when she has the opportunity to tell him the truth about her and Dimitri, she doesn\u2019t, why, because, and I quote \u201cI might need him later, but soon, I\u2019ll do the right thing soon\u201d. Oh Rose, how noble you are to do the right thing only when it is convenient for you. At this, I will cease my rant, because truly, I\u2019m not sure it will ever end. ...more omg!! the title is scaring the heck outta me!! oh richelle....please please let rose and dimitri be together, i think i will go into depression if not, i really feel for these characters!! i love them so much. i hope the spin off is adrian's story, though its probably not gonna be. *keep ur fingers crossed and hope!* i love how i wait for each of these books for a whole yr, read it in one day when i get and then the wait starts ALL OVER AGAIN!! gahhhh!! kill me! gosh...never suffered even half th omg!! the title is scaring the heck outta me!! oh richelle....please please let rose and dimitri be together, i think i will go into depression if not, i really feel for these characters!! i love them so much. i hope the spin off is adrian's story, though its probably not gonna be. *keep ur fingers crossed and hope!* i love how i wait for each of these books for a whole yr, read it in one day when i get and then the wait starts ALL OVER AGAIN!! gahhhh!! kill me! gosh...never suffered even half this much anxiety over twilight! ...more Oh, Lord.

And I shall do so with spoilers, cursing, and RANDOMLY CAPITALIZED SENTENCES. So there ya go. Don't say I didn't warn ya. I have never been in love with Vampire Academy. No book in the series has ever warranted more than four stars on my part, and I haven't bought any of them, either forcing my brother to buy it (\"I'll promise to pay you back!\" Not) or borrowing them from the library. If I had enjoyed this series more overall, as many of my friends did, perhaps I would have been less frustrated with this book. I always saw this series had potential, but instead Mead pulled a Meyer and epically failed . Shouldn't a series improve as it progresses and not make me want to cry anger tears? My forehead hurts from all the headdesking and facepalming I did. I'm not even kidding. I look like John Green did after he failed to follow proper headdesk safety regulations (Only he could fail at expressing disdain for failure). Anyway, my face hurts, I'm a little dizzy, and I've been stuck trying to finish this book for a week now and its all Richelle Mead's fault. That's damn right. I'm a victim. In the first VA book, I thought Rose Hathaway was a little immature, but refreshing because she could take care herself when most YA heroines can't even tie their own goddamn shoes without complaining. But in the end, she turned out just like the rest of them: self-absorbed and as annoying as hell. This isn't passive dislike either. I actively hate her. Over the course of the novel I have called her every name in the book, and I am one bit of \"Rose-logic\" away from tearing apart this novel with my teeth. Rose is just insufferable . She very well might be the most FRIGGIN ANNOYING PERSON IN EXISTENCE. Hey, Rose, ever hear of a little thing called \"humility\"? Oh, I'm sorry, is it not badass enough for you? Does it undermine your awesome hero epicness? I guess so. Rose needs to get frickin over herself. God, even the writing was pompous, using phrases like \"clearly\" and \"obviously\" like a four year old uses lip-gloss. She is completely self-absorbed and condescending towards others, looking down on those who didn't meet her standards of badassery. And seeming as everyone except Dimitri and herself failed to meet this standard, she was looked down upon people a lot. OMG. If I have to hear one more word about her super-special guardian abilities, I shall shoot a leprechaun in the nads. No, no, no. She couldn't just watch and participate in a conversation like mortal beings. She had use her guardian training which would scour facial expressions and hidden movements, picking up details that us weak and untrained humans would miss, pointing out the obvious as if she just won the Nobel Peace Prize. Nothing could ever just happen with her. It had to be action-y in some way. She didn't think, ideas \"hit her\". Everything was done \"without a moment's hesitation\" and with force. It was just obnoxious. I could go on and on, really, about all the sentence that annoyed me on every page, but I have feeling this review is already tedious. In this book, Rose is kind of like a less-awesome version of Leeroy Jenkins without the chicken. In real life, Rose, people will not just succumb to your awry plans then pat you on the head afterwards for your impulsivity after everything has gone annoyingly right. In real life, dragons kill you. Rose just has no consideration for others. She always thinks her way is the best. Forget the lives she ruins along the way, she's \"putting them first\" and isn't that what matters most? Hardy har har. Tell that to Jill (who you didn't even ask) and Christian (who you didn't even consult with). You didn't mind hurting them, did ya, Rose, as long as you had your dramatic reveal? BTW, who the hell let her near a microphone again? Come here so I can punch you. Back at the court, I felt like everyone was the Mystery Gang, except without the banging van and Scooby-Doo. What is the Mystery Gang without Scooby-Doo? A bunch of tools, thats what. They had no personalities of their own, just working as pawns in Mead's little game. Even my poor, sweet Adrian was glossed over. Do. Not. Get. Me. Started. On. Adrian. God, Rose is SUCH A BITCH. *rude gesture rude gesture rude gesture* Dimitri, you turned out to be a real prick, ya know that? I've never really liked you but now I really don't like you. Lissa, aren't you just the perfect little queen? *gags on bile* All the rest of the characters aren't really important enough to discuss individually. Oh, and I'm also really pissed at what Mead did to Tasha. First she makes a character who not only has a social stigma but also a physical deformity, makes her out into this crazed activist, and then turns her into this petty character who kills to get her guy. Bad form, Mead. Bad form. Another thing I found annoying was the constant back-and-forth between Rose and the court. Not only does the \"bond\" being such a blatant plot device really bother me, but it seemed Rose would be in Lissa's head for hours. Hours! Doesn't Rose being like the ADHD's five-year-old that she is, get a little tired of that? I know this book was mostly stalling, but she seemed to waste a lot of time. There are many and plenty of other things I hate about this book, but I am done typing. Overall, I hated it. I will not be reading Mead's next series, Bloodlines, for she is clearly only looking for money at this point, as evidenced by her unoriginal prose, glaring typos (it is \"though\" not \"thought\"), and tacky loose ends. I am just so annoyed. In the end, Rose got everything she wanted, unscathed. One more thing. The cover? Total porn star look. Every person I asked agreed with me. I was embarrassed to be seen reading this due to the sucky content, melodramatic title, and Miss Pouty Lips. ...more I dont know why everyones forgetting the most important character of all ADRIAN IVASHKOV what will happen to him if Rose and Dimitri get back together???

Last Sacrifice in a nutshell? Bullshit topped with every STD imaginable. Last Sacrifice should die a painful, painful death for:- 1.) Using a goldigging whore who uses only her sexuality to get what she wants and holds about as much brainpower as an empty glass. Are we supposed to see Rose some sort of role model and the ideal \u201cstrong female character\u201d when she truly isn\u2019t one?! 2.) Glorifying a romance that seemed to match with child grooming & ephebophilia , when really the foundation for the romance was a statutory rape masqueraded as a \u201clust charm\u201d , hero-worship, and sex. Lots of it. 3.) Making it seem perfectly fine that if your lover fucked your brains out in the bedroom but then constantly demean (because of your age and your sexuality) you then he is your soul mate. No question. Even if he turns into a malevolent creature of the night and emotionally and physically abuses you, makes you his blood-whore against your will and sends you creepy love letters, you should still by all means lust after\u2026 I mean love him because he is soooo hot and sexy and his tiny penis rocks your fucking world. 4.) For creating inextricable situations (potentially possessing momentum for a great series had the dumb bitch of an author gone about it correctly) but then having deux es machinas in the form of characters to immediately solve the problems so our Mary Sue and Gary Stu shitheads can have plenty of time to snag each other some more. 5.) Destroying potential of developed, lovable characters and the plot- all for catering to stupid hormonal, sexually deprived virgins (who probably use an icicle to masturbate over fictional characters) just to get some bucks even if it means losing your dignity while you\u2019re at it. Also, if you do happen to have a copy of this book, I suggest that you burn it because it makes a great Christmas fireplace. Or just recycle it. Be a friend to the environment! *thumbs up* I hated the conclusion to the series, knowing that it would go downhill from Shadow Kiss onwards- Blood Promise was a filler likewise Spirit Bound, both books were just two halves of one big bullshit. Last Sacrifice was on a whole new level of \u2018shit\u2019 for me- predictable plotline (I could have just read shit fan fiction and could not tell the difference between that and Last Sacrifice), vapid heroines, tedious & mind-numbing romance that consisted of- humping like rabbits 75% of the time and the other 25%- pointless declarations of love and we witness Richelle Mead\u2019s stupid philosophical explanation on the romance of Rose and Dimitri. It\u2019s great for checking your upchuck reflexes! Mine were working fine! I don\u2019t think I can gather together the entire plot to give you a coherent synopsis because reading Last Sacrifice meant I finally understood that the \u201clast sacrifice\u201d was my fucking brain cells , I do not want to endure that again. Secondly there was so much bullshit and since I am such a kind, thoughtful person- I wouldn\u2019t want to burden you with it. But here\u2019s a short synopsis:- \u25ba Rose is in prison (where she should belong, the dumbass) and her deux es machina of a dad comes along and tells her that in 2 weeks she could be dead if the trial goes wrong. That perks my interest. \u25ba Because Richelle Mead seems to be a huge fan of unrealistic prison breaks, Rose\u2019s friends break her out through impossible means because of course Rose has unlimited amount of luck. \u25ba She & Dimitri escape together (it\u2019s so obvious that Tatiana\u2019s murder was so they could get together and ~mend their shagromance. During this escape, all she can do is drool over his butt while telling herself she isn\u2019t over him and may I say she does a convincing job. Not.) \u25ba Rose jizzes her pants over Dimitri. When does she not? \u25ba Then Sydney is blackmailed by Abe to look after Rose and Dimitri and make sure they keep hidden until Abe & Co. prove Rose\u2019s innocence. What was honestly the fucking point of the prison break? Weren\u2019t they trying to do that in the first place? \u25ba Meanwhile, Lissa is nominated as a candidate for Queen of the Moroi and faces physical/emotional/mental tests in order to show she is capable of being Queen. Along with that, her, Christian and Adrian play Sherlock Holmes and Watson and try to find out who the killer is. \u25ba Victor and Robert invade Rose\u2019s dream, and for some fucking reason she trusts them into telling them about where she is and the Last Dragomir even though Victor is the one who forced her to be almost raped by Dimitri and tortured her best friend. I couldn\u2019t think of a better person, could you? So now that they are BBFs and after they give each other friendship bracelets- they team up to find Sonya Karp and turn her back into Moroi so she can tell them about who the bastard child of Eric Dragomir is. \u25ba They turn Sonya Karp ( Deux Es Machina #No. I-lost-count \u2014 the unlimited Luck strikes again !) back into a Moroi and unsurprisingly it turns out that Jailbait Deux Es Machina- I mean Jill- is Lissa\u2019s half sister, is this supposed to be some sort of amazing, shocking revelation? \u25ba It turns out that Victor is the evil mastermind that he was always in the fucking books, and he kidnaps Jill, but then Rose comes in with her God Mode Sue powers and saves her and then kills Victor. She feels bad for about 3 seconds and then proceeds to drool over Dimitri\u2019s cock. \u25ba Rose and Dimitri shag (because it\u2019s the only drive in their pathetic relationship) may I say that this is while she is still Adrian\u2019s girlfriend. Oh but don\u2019t worry\u2026 the cheating is A-OK\u2026 because she luuuurrrves Dimitri so fucking much that she just had to give into fucking his nonexistent brains out. Also, Rose\u2019s aura glows like the fucking sun when she is acting like a whore. Isn\u2019t this like 24/7? \u25ba They then return to court with Jill and Rose hands her over to Moroi royals like a dog and then blurts that Eric Dragomir is a manwhore in front of the entire Moroi population thus humiliating her best friend who is supposed to be a candidate for Queen. \u25ba Lissa becomes Queen, Tasha is the killer, Dimitri is Christian\u2019s guardian (even though he was just a Strigoi 3 weeks ago) so Rose and him can shag and protect them at the same time, the bond goes away for like no fucking reason, Rose tears out Adrian\u2019s heart and then Rose rides Dimitri\u2019s dick into the sunset doing it whilst over a pile of bodies that sacrificed their asses so the fucktarded romance between Rose/Dimitri can happen. Rose, of course, feels no remorse at all and Dimitri being the retarded asshole justifies her actions, why not shove your head up her ass too, you fucker? The inconsistency in the plot is incredibly repetitive- first of all Dimitri has no side-effects at all from subsequent to being a Strigoi? It\u2019s only logical that he should, be a much darker being of himself than he should be or even being mentally unstable, am I right? Nope. Because he realises that Rose\u2019s hair is sooooo beautiful, luscious, soft, and silky with no ammonia (honest to God, it sounded like a hair advert)\u2026 that he has a standing orgasm and becomes conscious of the fact that life is worth living for\u2026 her hair . Her hair made him realise that he missed acting like a child groomer by feeling her up and then acting like a complete shithead afterwards and now he wants to live that life again? Are you fucking kidding me? That doesn\u2019t prove fuck all that he loved her but he has a hair fetish. Disgusting motherfucker. Also, how Richelle Mead made Rose cheating on Adrian seem like no big deal because Dimitri is her soul mate. Oh really? Because that totally justifies the fact that Adrian treated her as an equal, cared for her, gave her what she wanted and loved her will never match the incredible power of Dimitri\u2019s sex factor and how hot he is. That was beyond cruel, especially to a character that I have grown to love right the way through the whole series, for Rose to get into bed with another man while she was with him, and then turn the tables to blame him for depending on her. I'm sorry, I\u2019ve never seen Adrian depend on her for anything during the course of this catastrophic plot so why Rose using this as an excuse? She was a goldigging whore. I'm surprised she doesn\u2019t yet dress in cheapskate designer and have Chola brows with huge earrings. End of story. I cannot believe there are some idiots on here who seem to think that Rose is a strong female character when she uses her killer, curvy body and her whorishness sexuality to get what she wants. She has neither intelligence nor the emotional strength to be a good heroine. Also what made me sick was how Dimitri said that he \u201cliked\u201d, \u201crespected\u201d Adrian, & could \u201cnever take another man\u2019s woman\u201d yet for a guy who seems to have \u201camazing self control\u201d- he still fucked her. (I hope to God, Rose & Dimitri gets HIV/AIDS and herpes after this.) The son of a whore is a hypocrite and he is now exactly like his dad, to be honest I'm not surprised that he turned out into what he is now: a child-grooming, perverted prick . Cheating/adultery are no way justifiable; I don\u2019t give a flying rat\u2019s ass if you happen to meet your soul mate, it\u2019s still immoral so I don\u2019t understand why this daft author think she can get away with it- considering your book is aimed at teenagers. \u2192 Also the digression of Tasha\u2019s character- Tasha is supposed to be fierce, intelligent and strong yet we see her as a crazed, jealous bitch that loved Dimitri and tried to frame that goldigging slut through royal assassination because she couldn\u2019t stand the fact that she lost to a stupid, dumbass whore? What the fuck? Since when did her character do a U-Turn or is Tasha a bi-polar psychopath? \u2192 The Ozeras have already been condemned for Christian\u2019s parents\u2019 actions; they don\u2019t need a murder to top the fucking list. Christian has been degraded for the whole Strigoi incident and this whole murder plotline was uncalled for and a nuisance, he shouldn\u2019t have to deal with another person\u2019s reputation on his shoulders and why, oh why, was her character beaten into a psychotic murderer of a character? \u2192 Lissa being Queen wasn\u2019t at all predictable! *sarcasm* Of course, you\u2019d expect her to pass all the tests and then become Queen. The only reason why she is Queen is so Rose and Dimitri can get away with the bullshit that they get up to. Hell, you know what this means, right? Rose and Dimitri can shag on Tatiana\u2019s grave or Dimitri could even piss from the highest tower in court, and those motherfuckers would get away with it because Queen Lissa would back them up as only she is allowed to pass judgement. \u2192 There was not enough of Christian/Adrian in this book; I loved the bromance and the banter between these two, which seemed to develop into a warm friendship. It was the only redeeming part of the book (other than Christian and Lissa\u2019s relationship). The snarky comments were amusing and did lighten my stormy mood for the duration of the book, and it convinced me to think that Adrian/Christian would be one amazing duo and I\u2019d rather have the spinoffs be about their adventures than some boring ass bitch like Jill. \u2192 Christian and Lissa are my only favourite canon pairing right now- honestly I love how they strengthened each other to be a better person, and his support for her during the time she was doing her tests was so endearing. What made me sad is that this healthy, balanced relationship which wasn\u2019t about motherfucking \u201clust-charms\u201d (rape is more like it) and \u201ccabin-sex-awesomeness\u201d was overshadowed largely by two assholes who honestly should look into getting jobs in the Dhampir porn industry seeing as Rose is halfway there. They had completely opposite characteristics, they initially clashed but they had something called development, they didn\u2019t let the other put them down and solved their issues in a sensible way. See? That is a fucking relationship! Not a one night stand with a perverted child groomer whose hobbies consist of reading cowboy novels, and sessions involving lotion, tissue and never ending lonely nights. Well, he has Rose now, so \u201cthe-curse-of-continuous-masturbation\u201d has finally been broken. Good for him, that big slut! *sassy gay friend reference* \u2192 Adrian- I loved him in this and glad that he didn\u2019t let Rose walk all over likewise Spirit Bound, he called out on her shit and said that she was a goldigging skank who didn\u2019t give a flying fuck about anyone else but her Russian sex-master. He doesn\u2019t and didn\u2019t deserve Rose at all, and I'm hoping he gets together with some vodka and some Las Vegas showgirls to show him a good time. I wished he had gotten together with Avery, they were a gorgeous couple back in Blood Promise, but obviously Richelle Mead is a sadistic bitch who doesn\u2019t like seeing anyone but dumb bitches and assholes happy! Adrian has developed a lot as a character, more so than the main two as well as some other secondary characters, he was entertaining and charming and I had hoped he\u2019d get his happy ending (just not with Jailbait and Sydney) but he got the short end of the fucking stick. The stick was probably up Dimitri\u2019s ass anyway. \u2192 Dimitri \u201cshould-be-in-prison-for-being-such-a-fugly-grenade-who-spends-his-time-getting-pubescent-ass-and-ruining-dusters-for-the-rest-of-us\u201d Belikov, I think you\u2019ve heard about my burning hatred for him and I don\u2019t think I can ever complain about him enough- in short he is an exotic child molester who changes his personality faster than Rose rides people\u2019s dicks who ruined Russia for me. Honestly? His ass should get back to soviet Russia where women don\u2019t take that shit from him. Or, you know, Stalin kicks his fucking ass. I\u2019ve never wanted to snap someone\u2019s dick off and shoved it up someone\u2019s ass, and this character is fictional. I'm tired of his stupid repetitive chat up lines- \u201cyou are so beautiful it hurts me and because you are a na\u00efve attention whore I just say so I can get some pussy LOL.\u201d- he should be working for Hallmarks or some other crappy card making company so half-witted romantics can fall for his lines and the sex scenes sucked donkey dick! I could write a better sex scene and I'm a virgin- hell the Edward and Bella pillow biting sex scene in Breaking Dawn was porn compared to the sex Rose and Dimitri have. Tatiana/Ambrose turned me on more than they ever could! \u2192 Jill was a boring, basic ass bitch who is a plot device so Lissa can be queen therefore shag-a-thon \u201810 is able to happen. It was pretty obvious that she was going to be Lissa\u2019s sister because you can\u2019t have her kissing asses all day long, you have to make her seem important while kissing ass. Sydney- I don\u2019t mind her character but she isn\u2019t Jesus to me- but the way Rose left her to rot in prison and then didn\u2019t even think twice about her angered the crap out of me. Same with Eddie- who was the only Dhampir I liked throughout the entire series- he had brains and he was committed for calling Rose out on his shit yet he met a horrible end. I cannot stand it when such amazing characters such as him have an undeserved ending yet the skank ass bitch lives in luxury. \u2192 Rose is just a fucking cum dumpster for Dimitri; she is a skank-ass-monkey-fucking whore who deserves to cut with a chainsaw and a blunt axe. How is she living? She is too fucking stupid to live and she should have just died in that fucking car accident instead of Lissa\u2019s family. She is a shit guardian; her vocabulary does not surpass \u201cbad ass\u201d and \u201cGod\u201d, she should have been sent off to a bloodwhore commune because that\u2019s what she should have graduated as: the WHORE OF MONTANA. The pacing was horrible and the book was set out badly, I don\u2019t know if Richelle Mead actually has editors or baboons scratching their asses over her manuscripts. There was no element of surprise, or suspense or anything exciting at all, I was excited finishing the fucking book. It was just shit and should be thrown into a fire. So everyone, save your gas bills by burning copies of Last Sacrifice :D ...more Well, that was such a pretty incredible conclusion of the Vampire Academy series!

THIS IS WHAT I AM SAYING . I hate this feeling. This bittersweet feeling because it's finally OVER . No more Rose, Dimitri, and Adrian moments. No more snarky and entertaining narration from the world's most badass fictional heroine. THAT'S IT. But you know the good thing? I really had fun with this series! It's because it really had me invested in the characters. Last Sacrifice is one of the best series-enders I've read so far. It's adrenaline-pulling and full of actions. It's also fast-paced, unlike the previous books which are a little dragging. I also love the mystery involved in this book. The killer of the important character was finally unveiled here, and guess what my reaction after finding out who the culprit behind? It was mind-blowing! There were also more revelations other than the murderer. And I was also introduced to the other side of the vampire world. I did not know there were such people like the KEEPERS . There were also more involvements from Sydney and The Alchemists . And yes, Abe Mazur FTW! And did I say Lissa's character really improved here? I love everything here in this book, I just wished there was a different kind of ending between Rose and Adrian. It did not sit well with me. I love that boy and it pained me so much when their final coversation happened like that. BIG OUCH. To Adrian Ivashkov...

Took me two years to finish this series, and while I had long droughts of not reading it, I was always happy to get back into the world and now I'm done and what the hell. I just loved all the character development in this series and with a series this long, that is always what I look for. I might eventually read Bloodlines because I know people will ask. It's not high on my tbr but eventually I will.

Book 3 was my favorite and it was just a meh series from there on out. The main reason I dislike this series is because I think Rose is SOOOO annoying and immature. Thinking that maybe she would develop throughout the series, I kept giving her second chances, but she's just as childish and impulsive in book 6 as she was in book 1.

She is smart and clever and I think she has a Victor complex and she thinks shes doing it to better the Moroi and dhampir society. Abe is clearly going to break Rose out of jail because he promised her she wouldn't go to trial, so he is obviously going too break her out before the trial even begins and she is going to go on a journey to find Lissa half sis/bro (which I agree could be Jill.) Clearly Dimitri still loves Rose and is just saying that \"love fades. mine has.\" because he doesn't want to hurt her anymore then he has. But i think he is going to do everything in his power to protect her from the royal guard and he's going to admit that he still loves hers. I have a feeling that Rose is going to come threw and find Lissa's sibling so that she gets her seat on the Royal Court and I also think she could potentially be the next queen. As for the \"Last Sacrifice\" title I think that it could be two possible options. Option one is that is is Rose's sacrifice because clearly she already has sacrificed so much and she is going to sacrifice her career has a guardian to be with Dimitri. This theory come from Blood Promise when Avery looked through Roses mind, maybe her spirit abilities allowed her to look too the future and she and Dimitri really will end up together. Which means Lissa and Christian will end up together and would live at Court. If this happens then I hope Adrian ends up with someone because I love him and I sort of want him to be with Rose but I'm torn. I think that he will end up saving someones life like Sydney and then she will be shadow-kissed and it will save him from the madness and they will fall in love. (she did admit that she thought he was attractive in Spirit Bound) Okay so option two. The \"Last Sacrifice\" could be Dimitri's sacrifice. I feel that if he isn't able to get over the things he did as a Strogi then he is going to end up dying somehow by sacrificing himself to save Rose somehow. It is going to be some dramatic seen and he is going to tell Rose that he has always loved her and he would rather die so that she could be happy. If this happens then I think Rose and Adrian will end up getting married and having children and they will live at court and Lissa and Christian will be there too. I also think that its possible that Eddie and Mia will hook up and maybe the spin-off series will follow them also with Sydney and Lissa's half bro/sis. ...more CAN NOT WAIT FOR LAST SACRIFICE.....Loveeddd spirit bound sooooo much... i was gutted when it ended. the last chapter was an amazin clif hanger lol... i felt like it was kind of like an insight to the next book and kinda what it has to offer ... i definitly think abe will get her out of jail at the court because they wouldn't continuously mention the fact he is like a big bad ass and has all these connections ... hes like the moroi verson of the godfather... i think dimitri will finally snap out CAN NOT WAIT FOR LAST SACRIFICE.....Loveeddd spirit bound sooooo much... i was gutted when it ended. the last chapter was an amazin clif hanger lol... i felt like it was kind of like an insight to the next book and kinda what it has to offer ... i definitly think abe will get her out of jail at the court because they wouldn't continuously mention the fact he is like a big bad ass and has all these connections ... hes like the moroi verson of the godfather... i think dimitri will finally snap out of his trance and realise that rose doesn't care about what he did and yeah he was evil but not by choice... and then they will finally possibly be together... (fingers crossed).. i also think that theres something fishy about Tasha Ozera throughout the books i kinda thought she was a pointless character but i think she could possibly come out in this book and could possibly be Rose's enemy... and maybe shes plotting against rose in some way.. why would she vote to have rose as her guardian knowing that shes Lisa's???... And i was thinkn... how did someone kill the queen and get away withi it when shes constantly guarded at all times by guardians??... were there no cameras at the court for the queens protection like there was with the prison??... how did they not get caught on the camera or how did they get in and out of rose's room withouth being caught on the camera??... Maybe its someone who knows the guardians and they dont see as a threat..Tasha Ozera by some chance?...

Don't get me wrong I am happy for Rose and Dimitri but did they have to remain guardians. I wanted them to choose themselves over duty and go start their life fighting injustice on their on term. The ending was too perfect not saying someone should have died but not every story has to have a perfect ending.

If Lissa was not crowned queen or Rose and Dimiti leaving court that would have been fine. What about Robert Victor's brother, Sydney, Eddie too many unanswered questions. The comment below was written before I read the book: I think Ms. Mead can go in many directions with this last book. I would love to see Adrian as the main villian in disguise. I think Adrian killed Queen Tatiana because he wants to be King. He sees Lissa as his biggest threat to the throne. Therefore, dispose of her protector. Once Rose is out of the picture, Lissa will be an easier target. As far as his feelings for Rose, I think its a facade. She is just another Dhampir notch on his belt. Adrian could have enter the Queen's chamber unnoticed. He is her nephew and no one would suspect him of harm. Adrian is mysterious and a ticking time bomb. Dimitri may indeed be Rose knight in shining armour. Once Adrian true intentions are revealed, who will Rose look to for comfort? However, Dimitri should not ignore that Rose is a willing blood whore for Adrian. ...more I'm psychic. Yes ladies and gents, you heard me right. It's true. I predicted everything. I quote myself; \"I think that (view spoiler) [Tasha (hide spoiler) ] killed the queen. She's just a little too suspect... Plus, she hit on Dimitri, which made me hate her. NO ONE BUT ME (and, ok, maybe Rose too) CAN HIT ON DIMITRI!\". This was indeed the perfect ending to a perfect series.

Well, I have to say that I think everything that happened in this book was bittersweet yet inevitable. This book opened up more possibilities than any other book in the Vampire Academy series thus far had -- and, though this book brought an end to Rose's first-account tale, the story is far, far from over. As a fan, I really can't wait to see where the characters will go from here, how they will grow, what struggles they will have in the uncertain future. Unlike What to say about Last Sacrifice ?

As a fan, I really can't wait to see where the characters will go from here, how they will grow, what struggles they will have in the uncertain future. Unlike other endings to series, this wasn't an \"end-all\" book -- and, while that was disappointing to me, I can't say it wasn't expected. There were too many loose ends to tie, too many fates to determine, too many answers to give in the pages allotted. Richelle Mead says in her Acknowledgements page that she \"[hopes] you'll continue to enjoy the many Moroi and dhampir adventures to come.\" I feel a little dismayed by that since that makes it sound as though the books will continue endlessly. I already know Mead has a six-book series ahead of her still -- but could more follow? Personally, I'd rather have an ending where I could ponder the characters' futures for myself than follow them for the rest of my life. This book, however, cements my desire to see the journeys ahead for a few characters -- namely, Adrian the Moroi spirit user with the vice habits and Sydney the Alchemist who aided Rose through quite a few misadventures. (I'm also interested in an unusual Moroi by the name of Angeline; I'm certain Mead has plans for her as well.) The next VA series is set to be third-person, so chances are more likely than not that we'll see POVs from Adrian and Sydney at some points. (I'm also keeping my fingers crossed for a romance -- but that's just me.) Overall -- yes, I liked this book. Yes, there were things I didn't like about it. Do I think Rose's \"growth\" was genuine throughout the series? No, not at all. I felt she didn't learn ENOUGH lessons. However -- flaws aside, I do think the series is a step above other young adult vampire series out there. And, yes, I do believe Bloodlines will prove to be just as engaging (and sometimes infuriating) as Vampire Academy was. I am a hopeless VA fan, so of course I'm already dying to know what will happen in the next series. All I can say for now: let the speculation begin! ...more Last Sacrifice by Richelle Mead actual rating: 2.85/5 stars 4th series finished so far this year, am I killing this reading challenge or what? ;) So, this is the final instalment in the Vampire Academy series, and I was a bit disappointed, I think I kind of fell out of love with this series after or maybe even during book four.

Maybe this is because I'd read soooo many books in between reading books three and four, that my tastes grew and my criticisms became tougher, in a way. However, I absolutely adored the first 3 books in the series, and they will always hold a special place for me. It is really sad that I personally found the series to lose its appeal as it went on. Last Sacrifice is a good book, but not a great book, or a particularly 'amazing' end to a series, which I was holding out hope for, but never truly expected I'd get after reading books 4 and 5. I found myself skimming through some slabs of text on some pages because they just weren't necessary, and I feel as if the last couple of books weren't written as well as the first few, sadly. For the huge amount of pages it has, it didn't feel like it went very far, or that very much actually happened. I think the ending was okay, pretty disappointing to be honest, nothing to completely blow me away. I was content with most aspects of the ending, however found the whole Lissa thing extremely predictable, though I am glad that happened.

This is one of those sad times in life where you really don't want to admit something is bad because you feel like you have a commitment to it. That's how this review is for me. I would give anything to say that I loved this book, I felt it was a great ending & that I couldn't wish for more. But I can't, because none of that is true. The beginning has Rose in prison for alledgedly murdering the Moroi queen, Tatiana. Of course, the plot line begins when all the characters in the book chip in to help her escape, because, really, we were expecting that would happen. After her escape, Rose goes on the road with Dimitri, her instructor-turned-lover-turned-Strigoi-turned-dhampir again-turned partner in ansgty lurve, and Sydney, the Alchemist she met in Russia. Here's where the boredom starts. Basically, this is what happens in a nutshell. - Rose decides to find Lissa's illegitimate sibling to help Lissa get a voice on the Council (and, ultimately, the crown.) She starts out by searching for Sonya Karp, a teacher her and Lissa had who turned Strigoi to escape the effects of spirit-use. They find Sonya, and with the help of Victor Dashkov's brother, Robert, turn her back into a Moroi where she then leads them none other than Jill Mastrano. Shocking, I know. (OK, I knew Lissa's sibling was going to be Jill, but that's just me and my uncanny ability at guessing endings.) Rose, Dimitri and Sonya (Sydney has been cap agetured at this point & the Brothers Dashkov have abducted Jill) then hunt down Victor, Robert and Jill. In the preceeding fight, Rose kills Victor and feels guilty, but only for a couple pages because she's too awesome to feel guilt, you know. They then show up in the knick of time to push Jill into helping Lissa win the crown. There's then the ever-impending question of who really killed Tatiana and framed Rose? Well, of course it's Adrian's mother! Cause, you know, THAT MAKES SENSE. Not. Well, it was our ever-adorable Tasha Ozera, the aunt of Lissa's beloved, Christian, who killed the queen of the vampire world just to change an age rule and frame Rose, the slutty seventeen year old who stole Dimitri (oh, sorry, Dimka -_-) from her. Yes, that's how it was, I'm not even joking. Moving on. Now that Lissa's queen and Rose is going to be her quardian, well, aren't we all just the happy family?! But wait! Dimitri's to be Christian's guardian so whenever Lissa and Christian hook up for visits...yes! It means Rose and Dimitri can too! I am actually choking on my own sarcasm at the point, so I'm going to stop. In my opinion, throwing Tasha's character under the bus was totally unnecessary. Maybe it's just me, but I think Tasha would've had more reasons to assissinate the queen than just the age rule =\\ Second, I never thought I'd hate the Dimitri&Rose relationship as much as I did in the book. Disgust doesn't even go there for me. I was devestated when I realized how things were going to work out near the end and just down-right pissed when Rose just mentally abandoned Adrian. Everything he'd done for her and even continued to do went right down the drain because Dimitri thought her hair was beautiful. I literally almost threw the book at the wall at that point. Then there's the Keepers. The \"J. Jenks\" of Vampire Academy. End of story. & The craptastic end. For real? It's all that easy? Everything is peachy keen for Rose, Dimitri and Lissa and isn't that all that really mattered? No, it wasn't. Fail ending to a great series, ONCE AGAIN. ...more 3.5 stars or 4. I don't know. Hmpf.

Pretty much. *frowns* The entire book is one long action sequence, and the bond between Lissa and Rose did a good job of letting us keep in touch with all the main characters I like. I didn't get bored while reading this, at all. But the entire thing felt a bit like Rose was yelling \"Here I come to save the daaaaaaay!\" on every page. I think it was very obvious what was going to happen between Rose and Dimitri in this book. And I don't say I didn't want them to be together because I'm happy they are. But the way Adrian gets treated... I'm sorry but, that's exactly the reason why I'm giving this book 3.5 or 4 stars instead of 5. I know, I know, my spot for him is very soft, so I kinda want to morph into a tigress and bite the head off every person who tries to hurt him, but still , hear me out. I'm not exactly annoyed by the fact that Rose and Adrian broke up, because we all knew what was coming, and Adrian did too if he was honest with himself. But when I realized nothing was going to happen between Rose and Adrian after their last 'conversation' I nearly crushed my Kindle. It felt like he was being kicked off the plane and everybody just stood there and waved goodbye. That was not the way I wanted to say goodbye to Adrian. *jumps after him and yells \"Adriaaaaaaaaaaaaaan\"* GAH.

It had a cheestastic premise and horrible, horrible covers and I defended it. \"It might sound lame\" I protested \"but this Mead really knows how to keep you hooked. And I love Rose and I love Dmitri and I will be so happy for them to get their happily ever after!\" And then this book happened. When a book manages to make you disgusted with (1) the heroine (2) the hero (3) them as a couple then you know something is wrong. Why I now hate Rose: Rose has always been flawed. That's what I loved about her. She was a rebel, a troublemaker, a flight risk. But she also had a good heart and she wasn't kill-me dumb. In book 2, it even looked like she was maturing. She was NOT running off to hunt evil Strigoi (though she does run after her friends who did). Even her friend comments that she is being more rational than before. And after everything that's happened to her (killing Strigoi, watching her friend die, having to kill the love of her life, etc.) she should have continued that emotional growth. Instead she is so irritatingly dumb, selfish and thoughtless in this book I stopped caring if she lived. She gets whisked to safety by Dmitri and Sydney and what does she do? Whines about how boring it is and runs off into the wilderness...with no money, no contacts, nothing and with all the forces of the Moroi kingdom trying to kill her. Why? Why can't she form a plan that lasts beyond her immediate gratification? Also, she treated Adrian like absolute crap, came up with preachy reasons for why this wasn't her fault and really only felt bad because he called her out. When Dmitri keeps protesting that they can't be together she can't see any possible reason why they couldn't hook up, because the old problems (she was too young, he was her teacher, they had to focus on Lissa) weren't true anymore. Dmitri has to remind her, several pages later, that she had a boyfriend . She in fact forgets about Adrian for long periods of time and only finally breaks up with him to his face because he confronts her. Rose, I'm sorry Mead turned you from a character I loved into a whiny little brat. RIP, Awesome Rose. Why I now hate Dmitri: Mostly because he keeps telling Rose how awesome she is when she has turned so rancid. Also, because despite all his talk about honor, he STILL hooks up with her while she is with Adrian. Why I now hate them as a couple: I didn't even care when they got their happily ever after. I really, really didn't. And after how much I loved the Dmitri/Rose ship earlier, that is horrible. I just hated Rose so much in this book and Dmitri was such a shadow of his former self, I just couldn't bring myself to care. My favorite characters in this book by far were Adrian and Victor Dashkov, mostly because they seem to be the only characters willing to call Rose out on her bullshit. It's sad when I like the villain so much more than the heroine. Mead continues to be badly in need of editing. What was the point of the Keepers? NONE! They didn't show up again. They didn't DO anything important, they didn't have any important plot-related information. They just took up a good chunk of the beginning part of this book, for no rhyme or reason. And all the giant plot holes of the earlier book did not get answered. WHY ARE THE STRIGOI SUDDENLY WORKING IN GROUPS AND USING HUMANS!?!?!? Whenever we see Strigoi it does not seem like they have problems organizing. Dmitri apparently had a great Strigoi network working for him. So why was everyone SO surprised in earlier books when groups of Strigoi attacked? I always thought we'd learn there was some amazingly powerful spirit user controlling them or some badass Strigoi had grabbed power and was forcibly organizing people. But nope, no reason. Same with human help. All the Strigoi encountered make it seem like it's no biggie that humans do things for them. There are even conversations (mostly in Blood Promise ) about how humans work for Strigoi. So why in Frostbite was everyone freaking out about the possibility? Was there never a good answer or after the third book Mead just got lazy and stopped trying to be coherent? There's apparently a spin-off series ( Bloodlines ) which I don't think I'll even read. Mead has ruined this series too thoroughly. ...more Spoiler free review... proceed with ease...

In this series, Rose journeyed, struggled, fought and ultimately decided, and that\u2019s that. I couldn\u2019t have asked for anything more in a final installment for one of my favorite series. Richelle Mead wrapped up this storyline in the best way I could have anticipated and regardless of what team you\u2019re on\u2026 if you\u2019re Team Rose, I think you\u2019ll be satisfied. I\u2019ve rooted for Rose\u2019s character from book one; and as much as Blood Promise and Spirit Bound had me doubting the development of this series, I never wavered in my allegiance to this main character. Up until Shadow Kiss , I was captain of Team Dimitri, by the end of Spirit Bound , I was organizing rallies for Team Adrian. Now, at the conclusion of The Last Sacrifice , I call myself a Team Rose fan and that\u2019s how it should be. I\u2019m happy with her choice as she worked hard for her version of a HEA. There was a part in this story where it suddenly hits me why I loved Rose\u2019s character so much. It\u2019s when she\u2019s telling one of the main characters that \u201c\u2026In spite of everything that\u2019s happened, I\u2019ve never thought of myself ... as a victim. Being a victim means you\u2019re powerless. That you won\u2019t take action, Always\u2026. Always I\u2019ve done something to fight for myself\u2026 for others. No matter what.\u201d Reading that, proved to me why Rose\u2019s character resonated so well with me, she\u2019s strong, loyal, slightly arrogant and entirely decisive\u2026 all characters traits that delivered in the right dose had me rooting for her and respecting her choices and her fight. I loved it! This final installment kicks off with Rose dealing with the aftermath of Queen Tatiana\u2019s murder. She finds herself on the run trying to uncover the evidence that will prove her innocence and create the catalyst needed to infuse a drastic change in ruling faction of the Morois and Dhampirs. This book is filled with a ton of political strife, mysterious intrigue and most of all self revelation for the main character. She\u2019s committed to Adrian, but as her quest with Dimitri takes her on a road trip of discovery. Much is uncovered that proves to rattle her hopes of finding some semblance of peace and love in her life. There are a few aspects that I\u2019d love to get a more conclusive ending for and this character happens to be one of my favorite in the series, but I\u2019m the first to stand by the fact that not every element of a story comes with a pretty red bow. I hear Mead has plans for a spin off, so let\u2019s see where she takes this one. I have to admit that I was worried after the last two books that this final installment would just fall completely flat. Well, it didn\u2019t not.one.bit. I was happy with the conclusion and I\u2019ll read this entire series over again to experience Rose\u2019s journey from day one. Great series! You done good Richelle Mead! You really have! ...more SLIGHT SPOILERS (and excessive Twilight references) I will start with my usual and often spotting of unusual things on front covers of books.

Its hard to believe that this was only the second series that I ever picked picked up. Second being after Twilight. First impressions - I didn't like it. But I continued reading the series and fell in love. TO DIMITRI I love you. You have it all. Height, beauty, body of a god, fighting sills and the hottest female guardian hanging on your every whim. But someone needed to give you a firm back hand! You were stubborn with Rose and took WAY to long to realize that she was everything that you wanted. TO ROSE You are the most kick arse chic on the planet! You saved the day AND got the hottest guy in the sack *HIGH FIVES* TO ADRAIN I thought you took your break up with Rose horribly. You went ape shit on her. But then again I guess that is a normal teenage boy reaction, right? But come on! Even Jake from TWILIGHT didn't chuck that big of a tantrum when Bella ultimately went back to Edward. TO LISSA Or should I say ' Your Majesty ' - huh, talk about captain obvious. I would like to round up my 'speech' with a few small words. I know that like Edward v Jake there are also Dimitri v Adrian fans. But also like Twilight the story would always come down to Rose and Dimitri. It was ALWAYS about them, and they deserved their HEA. P.s Only thing that got me down was the ending with Adrian and Rose. I would have liked more of a understanding between them. It was abrupt and harsh and once Adrian left, what happened then?? ...more I can't wait! This book is going to rock!

I'll start by saying that the only reason I read this book after the complete disaster that was Spirit Bound is that I had already read five of the six books and I felt compelled to finish the series. First, I'll get the good out of the way since there really wasn't much I enjoyed. The supporting characters are fantastic. I love Adrian. He's charming and witty, but not overly perfect. He has flaws and room for growth, which makes him relatable. I also love how he called Rose out at the end, not only for her selfish behavior towards him, but how she was treating other people as well. I agreed with everything that he said (more on that later). I also liked Lissa during this book. She really matured a lot over the course of the series and she was strong without being obnoxious like Rose is. That said, I still didn't think it was believable that she would have so much love and support from the people since she really hadn't done anything to justify their support for her. She only graduated a couple months earlier and she didn't even have a counsel vote. I still liked her relationship with Christian, who is another one of the great characters in this series. I liked how he supported Lissa, although I miss some of the spunk he had in the earlier books, and do think he's been underutilized in the latter half of the series. Unfortunately the good was definitely outweighed by the bad. Rose is one of the most selfish and heartless narrators in YA fiction and that's saying a lot considering the YA books I've read. She uses people for her own gain, destroys their lives, then doesn't even bother to consider, let alone feel bad about, the damage she's caused. So what if Sydney is going to be in huge trouble because she helped Rose out? So what if Jill's life is seriously in danger and she now has to be involved in nasty court politics? So what if Eddie's career has been completely trashed thanks to Rose's antics over multiple books? Why should Rose have to concern herself with these things? None of these people are Dimirtri so they don't matter. And why oh why did Rose have to reveal that Tasha murdered Tatiana in the most cruel way possible, in front of everyone without even warning Christian first? I really felt bad for Adrian throughout the entire book because from the time he's first mentioned until the very end, Rose does almost nothing but criticize him. Rose also cheats on Adrian with Dimitri and then hides it because she still wants his help. And when Adrian confronts her about her selfishness towards him and others, she has the audacity to become self-righteous and criticize him for acting like a victim. I stopped rooting for Adrian and Rose as a couple during Blood Promise because I realized he deserved so much better. Then there is Dimitri who has become just as insufferable as Rose. Mead has finally showed me how Dimitri and Rose are alike, which she hasn't done in the past (there was a lot of telling us how much they were alike but no actual showing). In this book he is shown to be just as selfish and heartless as she is. Like Rose, he shows no empathy towards others. He's able to quickly get over the terrible acts he committed as a Strigoi within a couple months of being a dhampir again. He admitted to killing hundreds of innocent people but because Rose tells him that he needs to forgive himself and because she has beautiful hair, he decides that he should forgive himself and just moves on with his life as if nothing happened. Rationally, he should move on because he essentially had an uncontrollable mental illness, but someone who has any emotional intelligence and the ability to empathize with others would be consumed with guilt for a very long time over killing innocent people. The fact that Dimitri only needs a couple months to get over it and move on makes me doubt that his guilt was all that real in the first place. Dimitri's complete lack of empathy for anyone other than Rose is also shown by the fact that he tells her not to feel bad about all of the lives she's ruined (see above). He also completely disregards Adrian's feelings when he goes after his girlfriend and shows zero remorse for it. Dimitri, despite saying he has too much honor to ever steal another man's girlfriend, tells Rose how beautiful she is and then confesses his love for her. How is this not trying to steal another man's girlfriend? He then decides to sleep with Rose before she breaks up with Adrian. All he had to do was keep it in his pants for one day and he couldn't even do that. No one calls Dimitri out on his selfish behavior. Instead, we get to hear about how wonderful he is from Rose throughout the entire book. His greatness in Rose's eyes has become comical. Not only can he take down an entire army of guardians and defeat any Strigoi, he is also the fastest tent-setter-upper that ever lived. \"Despite my protests, he wouldn\u02b9t let me help with the tent. He claimed he could do it faster without me and that I should stay off my feet. I started to argue until he began assembling the tent. My jaw dropped a little as I watched how quickly he put it together. He didn\u02b9t even need the directions. It had to be some kind of record.\" That's right, Rose gushes about how quickly he can set up a tent. What's next? Are we to find out that he can open a can faster than anyone else? He's like \"The Most Interesting Man in the World\" from the Dos Equis beer commercials, only we're actually supposed to take Dimitri seriously. If only the problems in this novel were limited to Rose and Dimitri, but there's more. Like in Spirit Bound, the action is boring. Everything is solved way too quickly. It takes almost no time to find Sonya, change her back into a Moroi, and then convince her to show Rose and Co. where Lissa's sister is. It also takes very little to convince Jill's mother to allow her daughter to be used as a pawn in court games or to convince her and Jill that Rose is actually innocent of killing Tatiana. Victor is caught much too easily and it does a disservice to his character. He knows that spirit users can dream walk, so his solution for keeping Jill from telling Sonya where their location is to keep her from going to sleep. But he doesn't think to blindfold her so that she doesn't know where they are or where they're going. Victor is supposed to be much smarter than that. The darkness that spirit creates has also become a joke, or a plot device. Neither Lissa nor Rose really struggles with it in this book. The only time it actually impacts the story is when Mead needs an excuse for Rose to kill Victor and make Rose feel guilty so that she can identify with Dimitri. Before that, it has little impact on the story, and it also has little impact on the story afterwards thanks to deus ex machina Sonya. It's hard to remember how troubling the effects of spirit were during the first three books of the series. In addition to the slow action and easy fixes to major problems, Mead also wastes about a hundred pages with The Keepers whose only purpose seems to be to illustrate how taboo it is for a human and a vampire to have a sexual/romantic relationship, which had no baring on the current story. It was clearly only included for the purpose of setting up the spin-off series in which a human (Sydney) and a Moroi (Adrian) are likely to hookup. I could go on about the flaws in this novel such as the overly simplistic court politics, or the unoriginality of the tests Lissa had to undergo to be Queen, or how Mead destroyed Tasha's character, or how the effect of sunlight on the Moroi seemed to lessen as the series progressed, or how Rose was able to walk around in unfamiliar woods while in Lissa's mind (how did she not run into any trees?)...but I won't. Overall, a sloppily written book that I'm glad to finally be done with. P.S. I started the audiobook version of this novel but only got through about 5% before I couldn't take it anymore and started reading the book instead of listening to it. I couldn't stand the narrator. She spoke much too slowly and her accents for both Adrian and Christian were downright awful. I would not recommend the audio version at all, not even to fans of the series who think Rose and Dimitri can do no wrong. ...more \u201cSometimes the greatest tests of our strength are situations that don't seem so obviously dangerous.

Although there is 'Bloodlines' Sydney's character hasn't really sparked that much interest in me to want to hunt those books down and get reading. Has anyone read this series? Is it worth a read? Richelle Mead, however did an amazing job on each book in the VA series, giving the reader more and more twists and turns as the books progressed, finally tieing all the loose ends up in the final installment. Definately adding it to my 'favourites' bookshelf. In the 6th book in the VA series, Rose has been accused of treason after Queen Tatiana was found murdered, a stake having pierced through her heart. Facing execution for this crime, she must find a way to prove her innocence, whilst also trying to hunt down the illegitimate child of Eric Dragomir. With uncertainty and fear spreading through the Moroi and the Royal bloodlines a new King/Queen must be crowned, but with so much at stake and the new ruler having power to change the whole Moroi/Dhampir community around the world, Rose believes no one is more eligible than her best friend and spirit user Lissa. Without family to hold her nomination, Rose must find the illegitimate Dragomir so Lissa can take her rightful place not only on the council, but as a candidate for the Royal election. I loved it, i truly loved the final book in the VA series. Although not everything turned out how i expected there isn't a single thing i would change; it was perfect, it ended how it should, tieing everything together with a perfect little bow on top. \u201cLife, unfortunately, doesn't seem to care what we want.\u201d Lissa probably had the most growth in this series, being a favourite of mine i loved it. She's grown strong, fierce but still gentle and warm at heart without the snobby expectation that others aren't as important as the those with Royal bloodlines. Learning how to control her spirit and develop its abilities means that she can how bring back Stigori,which is a pretty badass skill if you ask me, it could change everything in their world, especially the fear and dwindling numbers from so many deaths. (view spoiler) [Although she may be young, her life experience, smarts and warm heart will make her an awesome Queen who has love for her people, but also stand for not only her own beliefs, or those with royal blood , but everyone in the Moroi/Dhampir community. Changing laws, and revoking others, will help change their world for the better, to make them stronger, and no one is more capable, cool headed and loving than Lissa Dragomir. (hide spoiler) ] Damn it, although i dont like Rose and Dimitri's relationship, how else could it really have ended? You could see it coming a mile away, one way or another they'd be together by the end. I feel bad for Adrian, Rose was pretty harsh when it came time to end things between them. I honestly thought she'd give him more of a chance than she did, but then again Dimitri is in the picture and all rational thinking leaves her brain once again. I wish i knew what happens between Rose and Adrian after this book and whether they remain friends or not, though i highly doubt it, its possible, time does heal pain. (view spoiler) [But the fact she cheated on him? well thats a hard one to forgive. There were better ways she could have done it rather than stoop to cheating on someone to legitimately loved her. It was her problem, her mistake, she shouldn't have brought him down with her like that, how matter how strongly she felt for Dimitri. (hide spoiler) ] I was a little surprised Sonya Karp came back into the picture, having only really been focused on in the first book and then shattered bits throughout the rest of the series im not too sure how i feel about her and her crazy ass, although i was happy for her and Mikhail, you can sense they really loved each other and im glad they got their happy ending. More for his sake than hers though, you could see he was torn up not having found her and ended her life while she was Stigori. Whether he'd have done it when the time came or not, is another story. THE KILLER THOUGH! WHAT!? I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING!? I really really liked that character and what they stood for but to kill for it.. um no, makes you as bad if not worse than the rest of those with Royal blood who use it for their own benefit , yep thats right im not giving it away. GO READ THE BOOK! If you haven't yet read this series, GET ON IT! You will not be disappointed in Richelle Meads amazing series of the VA academy, its amazing characters and beautifully thought out world she builds for the secret vampire community.
