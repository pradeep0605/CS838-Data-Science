I realize that\u2019s a bit of a broad generalization and it sounds a bit rude, but I don\u2019t care. Because more often than not, I\u2019m nuts too. I was born and raised in Minnesota, and if you know our state history, you\u2019re already aware that we were predominantly settled and populated by Swedish (and Norwegian) immigrants. So not only are many Minnesota residents of Scandinavian descent, myself included, a lot of our quirky mannerisms and even our accents are commonly attributed to this influence.

She\u2019s always found Minnesotans to be a very interesting form of science experiment\u2014what happens when you mix Swedish and American culture anyway? Taking what I know firsthand of Minnesota culture into consideration, I can only assume that Sweden, aka the motherland, is also a twisted place of dark, dry humor. Some mainstream examples that support this claim would include: Fargo, Drop Dead Gorgeous, A Prairie Home Companion and yes, even Mr. Purple Rain himself, who even though he\u2019s genetically a bit more exotic than a plain old Swede, definitely displays some of the more oddball (but typical) Minnesota traits in his own special way. The point being, the characters in this book felt oddly familiar to me, quirks and all. I\u2019m actually a bit surprised I loved the book as much as I did because I normally criticize authors for trying to jam too much into one story and this book had a lot going on: --shady business dealings --corporate fraud --murder --religious fanaticism --extramarital affairs --Nazis --casual sex --creepy pervs --violence against women --money laundering --sexual sadism --political proselytizing --dysfunctional family secrets And that\u2019s just scraping the surface. Because once Larsson got into it and started digging deeper into the plot and revealing more details, my head started spinning and I had smoke coming out of my ears. I wasn\u2019t expecting to be sucked in so quickly by the plot and am still reeling over the fact that this brick-like book (my copy has nearly 600 pages) went as quickly as it did. I just reserved the sequel from the library and am also excited at the prospects of a third. I\u2019m also sad that Mr. Larsson passed away. What a talented author\u2014not many could tie so much crazy shit into one story and still have it make sense AND be entertaining. Although I think whoever decided to change the title when they released this book in English is nuts too. The original Swedish title, Men Who Hate Women, is much more fitting. ...more I've heard and read many complaints about <---A>Stieg Larsson</---A> 's <+++>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</+++> : 1. It's misogynistic. 2. It's packed with clich\u00e9. 3. It's too convoluted. 4. It's too disturbing. 5. Lisbeth wasn't autistic enough or was foolishly autistic. 6. There were too many red herrings, and the damn Nazi red herring didn't have the usual payoff. 7. Too/Two many plots. 8. Too hard on Leviticus. I will answer these in a moment, but first I must declare that I am an unrepentant fan of this book. This is I've heard and read many complaints about Stieg Larsson 's <+++>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</+++> : 1. It's misogynistic. 2. It's packed with clich\u00e9. 3. It's too convoluted. 4. It's too disturbing. 5. Lisbeth wasn't autistic enough or was foolishly autistic. 6. There were too many red herrings, and the damn Nazi red herring didn't have the usual payoff. 7. Too/Two many plots. 8. Too hard on Leviticus. I will answer these in a moment, but first I must declare that I am an unrepentant fan of this book. This is one of the rare times when I long for goodreads to have half grades, because I would love to give this 4.5. I can't give it a full 5, though, because I sense Mr. Larsson's series is going to grow in his last two books. And now...back to the top eight complaints: 1. Perhaps, but how can a book whose original Swedish title is \"Men Who Hate Women\" avoid misogyny? It can't. But at least the misogyny present is a comment on misogyny. Larsson isn't being misogynist. He's attacking misogyny. Moreover, our hero, Mikael Blomkvist, is not one of the men who hate women. He is a pretty good guy, actually; in fact, he's one of the rare guys I would actually categorize as a \"good guy\" in most modern literature. Sure...he's a bad Dad. Sure...he has a failed marriage and many sexual relationships. Sure...he makes some decisions that challenge his ethics. But he remains a \"good guy.\" He tries to do well in an ugly world. He never succumbs to cynicism. And he genuinely cares about all the people in his life. Male and female. And it's not like Berger and Salander are weak women -- far from it. There may be misogyny in Men Who Hate Women , but it is wholly the characters' misogyny -- those who have it -- and not the author's. 2. With apologies to my friend who's first name starts with T: Clich\u00e9, smich\u00e9! Yes there's some clich\u00e9 -- maybe plenty of clich\u00e9 -- but who cares?! Seriously? We're not talking about Proust here. We're talking about a mystery novel, a serial killer who-dunnit. Complaining about clich\u00e9 in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is like complaining about \"pinko sympathies\" in The Communist Manifesto . There's communism in Marx? Really? You think!? 3 & 7. Yep. There's a couple of distinct plots here, but there's a level of verisimilitude to that. Have even our banal lives ever had anything important happen without something else important occurring at the same time? Not mine, and to have multiple incidents happening simultaneously makes sense to me. The search for Harriet Vanger wasn't hampered at all by the Wennerstr\u00f6m drama, and vice versa. And to be honest, I loved having a pair of mysteries solved in the same novel. 4. Too disturbing compared to what? It's nowhere near as disturbing as American Psycho , and it's about average as far as the serial killer genre goes. Plus, I think there is a power in the graphic moments of this novel, particularly Lisbeth's vengeance on her guardian. I am not on her side when it comes to this vengeance, but I understand it, and the drive to take vengeance in such a way -- such a human way -- fascinates me. Who'd have thought, besides maybe my friend Manny, that the Swedes have it in them? 5. Perhaps this is true, but at this point I have only read one of the trilogy, and the only person who suggested that Lisbeth was autistic was Mikael, and while he thought she was suffering from Asberger's his guess was only in passing. I can cut the book some slack here. (suspend my disbelief, suspend my disbelief). 6. I was stoked that, for once, the Nazis were a red herring rather than the ultimate, degenerated evil. We all expect the Nazis to be the worst of the worst, so it is refreshing to see them as a deflection instead. 8. Can anyone really be too hard on Leviticus? Ummmmm...nope. Now, I admit that I might love this novel simply because it is set in Sweden. After all, I do love ABBA, Fredrik Ljungberg, IKEA (my apologies), gl\u00f6gg, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Max von Sydow, Ingmar Bergman, and Mats Sundin. I looked into emigrating to Sweden but had no excuse, being a resident of Canada with no skills the Swedes were looking for, and I am a fan of Norse Mythology, but I do love Sweden, and I was jazzed by the setting of Larsson 's book. All that aside, however, I think The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a compelling, entertaining and unabashedly thrilling read. If you can overlook the eight complaints, or consider them in a different light, you'll like this book too. I promise. ...more Women are raised to routinely fear rape. \u201cIf you go at night, take a friend.\u201d \u201cCheck under the car and in your backseat before you get in.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a good idea to know where the exits are.\u201d \u201cI got you this whistle for your keychain, you know, just so you have it.\u201d \u201cYou were an hour later than I thought you\u2019d be!

Women know that if we walk alone in the dark, statistically there is a good chance we will get raped. If we go to the wrong party, we\u2019ll be raped. If we misread that boy next door and his swellness is a con, rape. And when a person is in a position of being systematically controlled, it often does cause more physical or emotional damage to fight back. It\u2019s not right, but it is realistic. It seems to me like it is the equivalent of every man being raised that if he leaves the house at the wrong time, he might encounter a woman who will strip him naked, hold him down, and knee him in the balls while she masturbates. And then in this alternate universe, these boys find out, as they grow up, that most of the men they know have had that happen to them. And I\u2019m not trying to minimize sexual assault experiences that involve little or no physical injury, nor am I trying to minimize sexual assaults against men: no one has the right to touch another person\u2019s body without permission. I\u2019m talking about the way women are raised to think of daily life. Women are not raised to be afraid we\u2019re going to get a super hot BJ that we didn\u2019t realize we wanted, which is sometimes how I feel people talk about rape accusations. We are raised to encounter our daily lives knowing that, even if violence wasn't in our past, violence probably is in our future. And every time someone says, \u201cDon\u2019t go alone,\u201d it is a little reminder that a lot of men hate us. I have to say, though, that while I think it is realistic to say that women are raised to fear rape and to incorporate that fear of rape into our daily routine, and that sometimes fighting back makes things more dangerous, I do not believe it is effective to live in fear or to encourage women to live in fear or not defend ourselves. I think that perpetuates an idea that women are powerless, which then encourages women to freeze up when encountered with violence or even conflict. I think trusting our instincts and learning martial arts is probably more productive. And teaching men not to rape. That seems like the approach this book takes, though it more directly simply reflects, with appropriate outrage, on the levels of male contempt for women. And I think in that way, in the way it is directed to men, it is about how gross contempt for women is, whether it takes the form of self-absorption or sadism. This book is smart. It is symmetrical in its execution in many ways: in starting and ending with Blomkvist\u2019s corporate corruption story, and in the way it shows men and women accused of race whoring, men and women subjected to violence. The juxtaposition of (view spoiler) [Salander\u2019s rape with Blomkvist\u2019s consensual sexual encounter with Cicilia (hide spoiler) ] is really well played. It is viscerally grotesque in the contrast, and it highlights the theme of consent. It was physically difficult for me to read, especially in the contrast, and I thought that made it very effective. Salander\u2019s character, too, is smart. She is both the outcast that women are when we fight back, and she is something of the misunderstood-bad-boy hero turned girl. I liked that. When she (view spoiler) [saves Blomkvist, it is all really vivid and heroic, but still corporeal and disgusting. I liked that Blomkvist couldn\u2019t take charge because he was in too much shock, and that she truly saved his life (hide spoiler) ] . It bothers me when a storyteller starts to let a girl save a guy, but really she only tosses him the gun to save himself. Salander gets some real action and some real credit, and it is satisfying. Ultimately, it is pretty clear, but not laughing in your face, just resigned, Larsson knows (view spoiler) [Blomkvist is a self-serving ass, too. It was so smart at the end when Blomkvist runs into his nemesis with a girl Salander\u2019s age on his arm, and Blomkvist so despises him for it. I like how in the end our hero really isn\u2019t our hero. He really has only used Salander, and how far is that from hating women? It is certainly not respectful (hide spoiler) ] . The hatred we condemn in this book, though, manifests as violence, and I can get behind featuring that and then fading out to Cicilia\u2019s father condemning her as a whore and Blomkvist\u2019s blissful self-absorption. It is a meaningful gradation. But, it is important that (view spoiler) [Blomkvist isn\u2019t the ideal model of men being friends with women because he would be too specific \u2013 because there probably isn\u2019t an ideal model. Larsson doesn\u2019t justify Blomkvist\u2019s assholery, but he is not so in love with his hero that he can\u2019t acknowledge it (hide spoiler) ] . And, aren\u2019t we all assholes to each other a lot of the time? But not all of us get off on kneeing each other in the balls. This struck me as a very masculine translation of male hatred of women and the way women navigate a world that tells us every time we turn a corner that it hates us. It seems like men either have considered what life would be like if they had been trained to fear leaving the house after dark, or they haven\u2019t. And in my experience, it is difficult for men to understand a woman\u2019s words if she tries to describe it, so I think it is important to have a man tell a story this way. I do see how the graphic descriptions of sadistic violence against women might allow a sadistic audience to read only for that, but the fact that Larsson balances this with graphic violence against men neutralizes the gender-hatred aspect of that to me. And if you are reading these books for the violence, see a psychiatrist, but I don\u2019t think it is productive to censor descriptions of violence just because someone fucked up might get off on them. And if you think these descriptions are fantastical exaggerations, go spend some time at your local women\u2019s shelter. Unfortunately, I think you will find you are wrong. And I don't think it does anybody any good to be afraid to tell these stories. I hated the writing in this book a lot. Like, I hated it a lot. It both hit a lot of pet peeves of mine and it was just objectively bad in a lot of places. I don\u2019t have a problem with books being badly written if the writing doesn\u2019t get in the way of a good story, but here the writing was waiving its hands in my face the whole time trying to get me to lose the story. The sandwiches! OH TEH SANDWICHES! I wonder how much tourism for Sweden Larsson drummed up by the sandwich descriptions. I hope none because gag. I can see how he created the effect of an investigatory report through the writing, so, I think it is intentionally the way it is, but it was a choice I did not enjoy at all. So, overall this was a very unpleasant book to read, but it was smart, and its smartness outweighed its unpleasantness in my evaluation. It is always kind of a funny experience to read your own words as someone else would write them. In every Willa Cather novel I have read, there has been a moment where I\u2019ve read something and thought, \u201cI just said that last week!!!\u201d It was funny in Girl with the Dragon Tattoo : I wanted to high five Salander all the time because I would think her dialogue right before I read it. I imagine everyone in the world has told me to read this book because of the times I say, \u201cOh, another man who hates women.\u201d Or that it is bullshit to say someone had a violent childhood, so of course he had to be violent against women as an adult. So, it was funny to read somebody else say those words. At the same time, Salander felt like a man recording the facts of what he saw a woman do and say once, not like a living, breathing human character. That doesn\u2019t take away from the smartness of the book, but it is another reason my actual enjoyment factor was low. Also, I had to go buy pickles yesterday because reading about so many of them gave me a craving. I hope Larsson\u2019s estate got some sponsorship money from the sandwich and pickle lobbies.

Amazon pushed it on me for weeks, and the minute I stepped into Borders an employee ran over and recommended it. Thinking, this really better be the best book I've ever read, I took it up to the checkstand, where the register guy asked: \"Did one of our employees recommend this?\" Um, yeah. And Amazon, too. So of course I asked him why. \"Oh,\" he replied, \"we've been told to recommend it this week.\" That should have tipped me off right I really don't understand the critical orgasms over this book.

So of course I asked him why. \"Oh,\" he replied, \"we've been told to recommend it this week.\" That should have tipped me off right there: recommendations handed down by management. Pfft. I hesitate to suggest a conspiracy, but - did someone end up with too many of these in a warehouse in Duluth? Did Oprah make a bet with someone that she could pull strings and make the most boring book in the world a best seller? But I am suckered in by numerous good reviews and a fairly interesting book jacket description, so I buy it and take it with me on a trip camping with my family. Of course it totally sucks. I'm kicking myself because I feel like I really should have known. But the reviews - ALL the reviews - are absolutely positive from generally reliable sources, so I just DO. NOT. UNDERSTAND. Here's why I don't like it: I am about a third of the way into it, and literally hundreds of characters have been introduced. NOT ONE of them has done anything interesting, so I am finding it nearly impossible to keep them straight. I am the type that will be more or less satisfied reading the back of a cereal box, but this is BAD. I mean bad. The mystery is dull. The who done it is more like a who cares. The two primary characters are so far not very likable at all - in fact, the review descriptions are more interesting than the book descriptions of them. I'm betting part of the problem is the translation, presumably - but god, there is just some boring writing in here, too. \"He went to the store. He bought milk. He was cold. He went home.\" - BOR-RING! I am not really exaggerating, either. Actual content: \"He put on a pot of coffee and made himself two sandwiches. He had not eaten a proper meal all day, but he was strangely uninterested in food. he offered the cat a piece of sausage and some liverwurst. After drinking the coffee, he took the cigarettes out of his jacket pocket and opened the pack.\" Again, I'm willing to give the author the benefit of the doubt with the translating, but I wouldn't have gotten out of high school writing with that kind of boring and utterly pointless description. It sets the tone of \"lonely dude being lonely\" but really: two sandwiches? why two? sausage and liverwurst - fascinating. That's really just a page I opened to randomly - there is much worse. I am truly bitterly resentful of every minute I am stuck on the side of this mountain without a good book to read. I'm ready to browse the mini mart down the way and read the real estate magazines instead. Why have all the reviewers and Amazon steered me SO WRONG??? I am not trying to insult anyone's taste - so please don't get mad about my opinion. But if you love this book, please - tell me WHY. What am I missing? ...more After having leaped onto the bandwagon with the rest of everyone, I feel a certain amount of pretentious indie pride saying that I wasn't as awed by this book as everyone else apparently was.

So, the good stuff: the main s After having leaped onto the bandwagon with the rest of everyone, I feel a certain amount of pretentious indie pride saying that I wasn't as awed by this book as everyone else apparently was. Which is not to say that the book wasn't enjoyable and exciting; it just didn't knock my socks off whilst simultaneously blowing my mind and rocking my world. (that sounds like either some great song lyrics or a very complicated sexual maneuver. Let's go with the first option.) So, the good stuff: the main story - a disgraced journalist is hired by a rich old man to write a book about said man's crazy rich family, while secretly working to discover truth behind the disappearance and supposed murder of the man's granddaughter. Also in play is <---C>Lisbeth Salander</---C>, a freelance investigator who also happens to be one of the best hackers in Sweden. She also happens to be made of awesome , but I'll get to that later. The journalist is investigating a supposed murder (a body was never found, so no one even knows what happened to the girl), so violence is expected. I just wasn't quite prepared for just how intensely graphic the violence is. There's a lot of stuff dealing with assault, rape, and murder of various women. There is also a lot of sex in the book, and the stuff that gets described in the most detail is definitely not consensual and will probably make you very uncomfortable. You've been warned. The investigation itself is pretty fascinating, implausible as it is that some random guy investigating a disappearance that took place 40 years ago was able to find out completely new leads that weren't found by the police or the girl's grandfather (who's been obsessing about the case since forever), but I digress. The family itself is equal parts interesting, creepy, and frustrating. It's not until the journalist (Blomkvist) teams up with Lisbeth that things get really interesting, and they made such a fun team I wanted them to get their own detective show. The book deals mainly with crimes against women and those who commit them. Larsson obviously feels very passionately about this subject, as well as what should be done with the men who assault women. Without giving anything away, rest assured that every bad guy rapist/murderer/whatever gets a large helping of tasty justice. And now for the bad stuff: -There's a lot of nattering on about business and computers and journalism and more business stuff that either bored me or went over my head completely. -Larsson cannot seem to decide whether he wants to refer to people by their last name or their first name, so he switches back and forth and it is confusing. -A family tree is provided at the beginning of the book, since the family the journalist is investigating (the Vangers) is pretty big, but I never had much trouble keeping everyone straight. A map of the island the family compound is located on would have been much more helpful, since I never really figured out the geography of the place. -Pointless details. I don't need to know what the characters ate for every single meal, I don't need to know exactly what model of computer/motorcycle/car a character uses, and I definitely don't need to know what each character is wearing at every moment of the day. Larsson is especially guilty of this when Lisbeth is concerned - I guess he decided we wouldn't understand what a unique counterculture tough chick she is unless we know that she's always wearing leather jackets, boots, torn jeans, and black t-shirts with angry slogans. (yes, Larsson actually tells us what each of Lisbeth's t-shirts says.) Listen, Stieg: Lisbeth is awesome. She is wonderfully defined simply through her own actions and thoughts - we don't even need the other characters constantly reminding us how antisocial and tough and uncommunicative and badass she is. Believe me, we can see that. Show don't tell etc. To sum up, I'm going to give the last word to the book itself, and quote a sentence that's actually a character talking about a book featured towards the end of the story - but it could easily describe Larsson's book: \"It was uneven stylistically, and in places the writing was actually rather poor - there had been no time for any fine polishing - but the book was animated by a fury that no reader could help but notice.\" That, in a nutshell, was how I felt about The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. UPDATE: I just watched the film version of this book (the original Swedish one, thank you verra much), and am adding this to my \"the movie is better\" shelf. Not that the book isn't good; it's just that the movie streamlines the story and gets rid of everything I complained about earlier in this review. In the movie, all the minor characters and business-drama babble has been eliminated, Erika and Mikael's weird three-way relationship is thankfully unmentioned, Mikael never boffs Cecilia Vanger, and Noomi Rapace is so fucking cool as Lisbeth I can't even handle it. I'm also pretty sure they took some stuff from The Girl Who Played With Fire and put it in the movie, because there's some stuff about Lisbeth's past that I don't remember from the book. UPDATE UPDATE: Having now seen the American remake, and re-watched the Swedish version, I have come to a following decision. While the American version is, in a technical sense, a better movie (Fincher is a much better director - for just one example, the scene where Henrik Vanger explains the circumstances of Harriet's disappearance is a masterful example of show-don't-tell), I dislike the changes they made to the ending, and I simply cannot accept Rooney Mara as Lisbeth. Although I'm proud of Fincher & Co. for making her look and act as weird as the character should, something about her portrayal still wasn't right. If you're interested, this article explains pretty much every complaint I have about American Lisbeth. ...more Hey, kids, if you like books in which the only major descriptive moments happen during sexual torture scenes, where major characters lack motive, and where the red herrings...stink ... this book's for you!

The entire book sets you up to think that the alleged killing/s were perpetrated by one or more people for complicated reasons. Spoiler: They're not. A murderer, at the climax, reveals, \"I like killing [people].\" That's the motive. That's it. 2. The title character has her macabre past detailed at length. The salient facts to the case - how did she come into possession of her detective-ing skills? - is left out entirely. Her emotional life is ignored until it's needed for a little plot development and then ignored again for a gazillion pages. She makes Kinsey Milhoney look like a guru of emotional awareness and self-knowledge. 3. When a MAJOR DEVELOPMENT happens in the case, like, THE MAJOR DEVELOPMENT, we the readers hear about its resolution third hand. A reunion occurs and we are not privvy to it, even though it's REALLY IMPORTANT. That is LAME. 4. Stop with the Mac commericials aleady.

They don't even intersect, really; one segues into a second, and then, when the second is wrapped up entirely, the first plot returns to end with a whimper. 6. There is a Lot of torture-porn in this book. Did I mention that? Detailed description of sexual abuse, incest, and general nastiness that does nothing to advance the plot. Really. It just takes up space making you think there are reasons for the murders, but ...no, see #1. We listened to this on cd and I kept trying to forward and ending up on the absolute worst moments. Blech. 7. Several passages written as an email conversation. It's like the author realized at a certain point that he was so bad at dialogue that he'd better just give it a rest for a while and instead use stilted telegraph talking. 8. This book was not fun or smart. I kept thinking it was about to be, but I was wrong. **End of Rant** ...more The original Swedish title of this book is \"Men Who Hate Women.\" If you ask me, it suits this story much better than catchier but less relevant \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\" because it is in fact about men doing all kinds of horrid things to women.

So here is the first warning to you, if you don't handle violence against women and children well, skip this novel. It's hard to give a short synopsis of the book. \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" starts off as an investigation of a 40-year old disappearance of a teenage heiress, but gradually morphs into a tale of serial murder and corporate trickery spanning several continents and later takes in complicated international financial fraud and the buried evil past of a wealthy Swedish industrial family. I found this book extremely engaging and full of action and came to regret many times that I had an audio version instead of a regular paper book. I also enjoyed immensely the amount details about everything - the publishing business, twisted Swedish family, corporate crime, history and political order of Sweden, etc. I am guessing if you don't care to read about any of this subjects, this book is not for you, because it is packed with this information. My only qualm about this book, a small one, was the characterization. The character of Mikael Blomkvist smelled of a male wish fulfillment fantasy, the one where a man is adored by all women, gets laid all the time and always gets lauded for his stellar bedroom skills. Lisbeth Salander also felt a little shaky and I thought Asberger's decease didn't quite account for her strange personality. I thought her antisocial behavior was inconsistent. This however didn't spoil my reading experience. I am eager to move on to \"The Girl Who Played with Fire\" and see what Mikael and Lisbeth are up to next. ...more Disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist is hired to solve the decades-old murder of Harriet Vanger, member of one of the wealthiest families in Sweden. Aided by a tattooed, antisocial hacker named Lisabeth Salander, Blomkvist unearths horrible skeletons lurking in the Vanger family closet... For a few years now, I've been avoiding The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Since so many people told me I just had to read it, many of them non-readers, I assumed it was a lot of over-hyped, dumbed-down crap. Wel Disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist is hired to solve the decades-old murder of Harriet Vanger, member of one of the wealthiest families in Sweden. Aided by a tattooed, antisocial hacker named Lisabeth Salander, Blomkvist unearths horrible skeletons lurking in the Vanger family closet... For a few years now, I've been avoiding The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Since so many people told me I just had to read it, many of them non-readers, I assumed it was a lot of over-hyped, dumbed-down crap. Well, I may have been wrong. All hype aside, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a damn good book and I feel it goes beyond just being a mystery. Larsson creates some memorable characters. We've got Mikael Blomkvist, the tarnished journalist, Lisabeth Salander, bad ass hacker, for the leads, both multidimensional characters. Neither are by any means perfect but I liked them just the same. The Vanger family and the staff of the Millennium aren't as well drawn as the leads but Ericka Berger and some of the Vangers are good characters in their own right. I'll be honest. It took a little while for me to get moving but I was enthralled pretty early on. You wouldn't have thought I'd be that interesting in what could have been a tedious subject to read about, namely researching family archives for hints. Somehow Larsson managed to grab me, though. There isn't a lot of violence but what there is is pretty brutal. The hacking was pretty well done and not completely unbelievable. I guess what really sold the book for me was that I really believed in the characters. Both of them are pretty flawed but completely believable. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a some complaints. Aside from the pace, I felt like Larsson threw in some needless details. I didn't need to know the brands of a lot of products or what the characters were eating. I also thought that Mikael Blomkvist being a sort of James Bond in regard to the ladies was a tad unbelievable. Honestly, those are my only two complaints I can think of at the moment. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo deserves a lot of the hype it gets. Now go out and read it if you haven't already! Edit: I'm marking this down because I'm reading In the Woods and enjoying it more than I enjoyed this. I was kind of a whore with my 5s in past years. ...more I HATED this book. I don't understand all of the good reviews that are coming in on it. I hated the characters, the plot was thin - ugh. I can't believe I read the whole thing. He slapped her hard. Salander opened her eyes wide, but before she could react, he grabbed her by the shoulder and threw her on to the bed. The violence caught her by surprise. When she tried to turn over, he pressed her down on the bed and straddled her. That's just to give you a little taste of what one is dealing with by picking up this book. If you can handle that and the previous x amount of paragraphs and the following x amount of paragraphs, you're golden. If that sort of makes that thing He slapped her hard.

If you can handle that and the previous x amount of paragraphs and the following x amount of paragraphs, you're golden. If that sort of makes that thing in your throat rise up a little bit and make your mouth taste sour, you might reconsider reading this book. Carry on. I wasn't going to read this book, ever. But then I saw the theater up the street from me (a cool one that plays those indie and art films, and their popcorn is always sort of either stale or slightly burnt, and the employees all have an air of snootiness - it's one of my favorite places in town) is showing the foreign movie. My first thought was, \"When did they make a movie of this book?\" My second thought was, \"Dammit. I sort of want to see that movie.\" My third thought was, \"Sonsofbitches. I can't see it until I read it.\" (Yes, I'm hard on myself, thanks.) So last weekend when we went out of town I decided it was the best time to purchase it and read it. The mini-break was going to entail my boyfriend spending hours playing guitars with his brother and then later with his BFF, and his brother's fiance and his BFF's wife were all conveniently elsewhere for the most part, so I had the fantastic opportunity to tag along and not have to do a damn thing . I sat on the couch/futon/floor and read. I read a freaking lot. This was the book I had along to read. It passed the time. It didn't bore me. It held my attention. And... that's about it. It didn't turn my world upside down, or even teeter it necessarily. This is what I like to refer to as a nice popcorn read. I didn't have to give it a lot of thought, the story sort of did the work for me, I was just an innocent and willing bystander. I actually got a little annoyed the few times when it felt like I was beginning to have to work. Like figuring out who the hell Larsson was talking about at any given moment - he was apparently one of those authors who liked to use a character's first name in one sentence and then refer to the same character by their last name in the next sentence. What's up with that? Make a freaking decision and stick with it. Eventually I stopped caring so much. My biggest annoyance with the book (and likely to be the most offense to lovers of this book who stumble across my humble review here) was not the violence and the rape; it actually was Lisbeth Salander. The female protagonist. Okay, so she's cool. I get that. She's Hotty-McHotterson, all corporate and world-weary and a computer hacker to boot. She's pierced and inked, and for some reason this is such a source of fascination for Larsson (and apparently everyone who reads this book). Every time Salander comes into the story there is a mention about her piercings, her surly attitude, her tough clothes, her tattoos. At one point another character counts her tattoos. Six. Six . This apparently contributes to some point Larsson was trying to make that Salander is a social freak, but he's still clearly obsessed with the image of her. For the record, numerous piercings, surly attitudes, tough clothes and six tattoos sums up just about every female I know. It's not all that bizarre. This is, after all, the 21st century. Anyone who lived through the 80s/90s either embodies all of those things or at least doesn't bat an eyelash at those things in others. Maybe it's different in Sweden. Maybe they're just now getting the whole dyed-hair-pierced-faces-crazy-tattoos craze there. Wow. Way to go, Sweden. Maybe if you all hadn't spent the last 30 years listening to ABBA and Europe obsessively , you might actually not find kick-ass girls in boots all that magical. All of these unfair generalizations aside, I can honestly say that I read this book and I'm not all that excited about it. I'm not dying to read the next one, but I'm sure I will eventually (probably if they make a movie of it too). I'm certainly not waiting with bated breath for the third book in the trilogy to come out. I guess I'm just not that fascinated by Salander in particular, so I don't really care what happens to her next. Maybe the movie will make me feel differently. We'll see. ETA (01/14/12): I have since read The Girl Who Played with Fire which I enjoyed more than this first book, though my impression of Lisbeth hadn't changed that much. I have also seen the Hollywood version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo which I liked more than the book because the performances were fantastic, Fincher is a wonderful director, and I felt like the characters could breathe which is something I felt they were unable to do in the book because they were so constricted and pigeon-holed. ...more Larsson takes what seemed at the outset to be a juicy 'locked-island-mystery plot' and turns it first into an insightful family saga and then into a scathing political and social commentary that forces us to think about such a wide variety of themes and aspects that we normally refuse to accept as part of society. It takes an author like Larsson to shove it in our faces in all its stinking ugliness for us to stop turning the blind eye at these atrocities. Do not mistake this for a mere fictional Larsson takes what seemed at the outset to be a juicy 'locked-island-mystery plot' and turns it first into an insightful family saga and then into a scathing political and social commentary that forces us to think about such a wide variety of themes and aspects that we normally refuse to accept as part of society. It takes an author like Larsson to shove it in our faces in all its stinking ugliness for us to stop turning the blind eye at these atrocities. Do not mistake this for a mere fictional work with imagined crimes. It has firm foundations in reality. In my opinion, the whole plot is a thin wrap-sheet thrown around the brutal truths of real crimes. Larsson has extensive knowledge of the most heinous crimes and he has written extensively about them for his entire professional career. This expertise shows through in his description of such acts of unimaginable cruelty with an almost nonchalant objectivity, with a careless leaving out of the gory details and focus on the trivial aspects of the act that sends shivers down our spine. Larsson uses his investigative style of presentation and his two main characters and an extremely dysfunctional family to work in an amazing variety of potent themes into his first book. I cannot wait to see what he\u2019ll do in the second one. Some of the themes explored in detail are: Online Privacy This is not part of the plot but Larsson seems to be sending out a warning about how deadly information can be in the wrong hands and how easily accessible any private info about you stored in digital form is. You are exposed and absolutely naked to a determined digital assault and there is nothing you can do about it. Of course in the novel it is never misused but the threat is always hanging in the air - if an uneducated girl and her friends can get the most private information about the most protected individuals in the country, what kind of a world are we heading into? And is it really bad? Food for thought... Feminism No matter which way you look at it, this work will have to defined as one of the most wrathful outcries against society's attitude towards women. The entire story is about the enormous acts of cruelty committed against women and the absolute indifference to it by everyone who is supposed to care. It is also about the different responses that these women have in such an uncaring society. Which brings us to the most important theme of the book in my opinion: Morality and Allocation of Blame The book is truly about three paths that a victim can take after an abused childhood. One of the characters suffers abuse and decides to become an abuser himself and embrace it as a fact of life The second one suffers abuse and decides to run away from that life and live faraway and sheltered. No attempt is made to punish the abuser or to report it. The third character too suffers abuse but decides to confront it and return it with a vengeance. No violence or abuse is tolerated and any reaction is justified for this character. The fourth is the invisible character of what we expect a person to do in such a situation - report it, seek help from the authorities who are supposed to protect them. The society around and the grim reality that prompted the book gives the outcome to this course of action. Now the key point to me was that Larsson does not condemn any of them - he makes different characters speak in defense for each of these responses and lets us wonder about which course can ever be called right. in the end he manages to condemn both the society as a whole as well as us, the individuals who allow the society to be so. A caricature of morality. Law, Crime & BDSM Larsson's extensive knowledge about the worst forms of crime and the procedure of law allows him to give a gruesome reality to what we usually consider to be just sadistic fiction. He convinces the reader that it is real and all around us if we only cared enough to look. Nazi History, Military Training, Religious Extremism & Apologetics These are also touched upon at various points in the books and provides a background, especially of Swedish Nazism, from which the excuses for all the real crimes in the books could spring from. Journalistic (Professional) Ethics This too is quite obviously one of the favorite topics for Larsson and it forms a strong undercurrent throughout the book and comes to a head with the firm conviction of the lead character that he is finally a corrupt journalist. He is reassured that he has done the right thing by choosing between being a professional and being a human being. But we as the readers, the character and the author, all know that this is not remotely convincing. Justice was meted out selectively and subjectively in the end and even though it feels right, that is only because of personal knowledge. Is that enough? Financial & Economic Commentary, Industrial Espionage and Hacker-lore Large parts of the book goes into great detail about industrial politics and machinations and is sometimes quite boring to be frank, but it adds credence to the plot and has to be borne out. The elaborate hacker methodology too is a drag at times but remains mostly interesting and strangely disturbing. The financial interplay and the economic commentary sounds a bit forced but Larsson still manages to give out some forceful ideas such as: \u201cWe\u2019re experiencing the largest single drop in the history of the Swedish stock exchange\u2014and you think that\u2019s nonsense?\u201d \u201cYou have to distinguish between two things\u2014the Swedish economy and the Swedish stock market. The Swedish economy is the sum of all the goods and services that are produced in this country every day. There are telephones from Ericsson, cars from Volvo, chickens from Scan, and shipments from Kiruna to Sk\u00f6vde. That\u2019s the Swedish economy, and it\u2019s just as strong or weak today as it was a week ago.\u201d He paused for effect and took a sip of water. \u201cThe Stock Exchange is something very different. There is no economy and no production of goods and services. There are only fantasies in which people from one hour to the next decide that this or that company is worth so many billions, more or less. It doesn\u2019t have a thing to do with reality or with the Swedish economy.\u201d \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that it doesn\u2019t matter if the Stock Exchange drops like a rock?\u201d \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t matter at all,\u201d Blomkvist said in a voice so weary and resigned that he sounded like some sort of oracle. His words would be quoted many times over the following year. Family & Incest What it means to be a family and the inevitable nature of family relationships too seem to haunt Larsson and he gives free reign to his fears and troubles about family life, incest, indifference and corporate life affecting personal relations. He also asks the question of whether we can ever truly judge a person based on corporate success without knowing his relationships with his family and his personal life. There are probably other important ones that I have failed to mention but these were, in my opinion, the things that the book was meant to shine a torchlight on. On The Characters I found this in an interview with Larsson and it captures the enigma of the two amazing main characters: \u201cI considered Pippi Longstocking,\u201d he said, referring to the most famous creation of the Swedish children\u2019s author Astrid Lindgren, a girl so strong she could carry a horse. \u201cWhat would she be like today? What would she be like as an adult? What would you call a person like that, a sociopath? Hyperactive? Wrong. She simply sees society in a different light. I\u2019ll make her 25 years old and an outcast. She has no friends and is deficient in social skills. That was my original thought.\u201d That thought evolved into Larsson\u2019s formidable heroine, Lisbeth Salander. But he felt Salander needed a counterweight if his story was to be a success. Once again he turned to one of Lindgren\u2019s characters, this time to Kalle Blomkvist, boy detective. \u201cOnly now he\u2019s 45 years old and a journalist [called Mikael Blomkvist]. An altruistic know-it-all who publishes a magazine called Millennium. The story will revolve around the people who work there.\u201d Personal Impressions While I loved the book wholeheartedly, I still had a few unfavorable impressions: Some of the side characters are a bit sketchy not fully realized. Especially some of the family members including Martin who did not get a gradual transition that a character like him deserved for maximum impact. The stylistically simple nature of the chapters and the book structure too takes away from the sophistication of the detail and plot. A bit more variety in the technique than a simple shift-of-perspective would have been better and less obvious. Also the tension eases off at all the wrong moments, primarily because Larsson has given a portent of things to come later too easily for a whodunnit. The pace too is not consistent and we spend a lot of time seeing scenery and almost every chapter opens with making coffee or with long uneventful walks. In the end, the reader does not get the pleasure of a proper whodunnit as there were no hidden clues spread across the book and in spite of homages throughout the book to masters of crime and mystery fiction, Larsson at some point decided to make his book not fit to the thrill of that genre and moved instead to far more sinister territories. The last section of the book felt much like a filler and had way too much detail and predictable action and could just as well have been left to the reader's imagination. The long winding down has put me off from any tension that would have made me run for the second book immediately. Now that everything is calm and quiet in the Millennium world, I too can take an idyllic break from it all... A good editor and more time to polish would have made this into a definite modern masterpiece, which I strongly suspect it to be already. But in spite of the flaws we still have an opus and some unforgettable characters that will stay with us for a long time to come. One Final Note: All the villains have a Windows PC and all the heroes have an Apple notebook. Splendid thing to use in a book about corporate morality among other things. I think this tipped the scales for the book to be a bestseller! ...more This is really a 1.5 stars. Ok, there was a good mystery during the middle third of the book. THere were alot of characters. There was suspense. AND there was also those first 200+ painful pages of character introduction and back story. That equals 1/3 of the whole book. Who slogged through those first 200 to find out that the mystery picks up? How did this series get so huge?

Of the two main characters, only LisBeth Salander was a character that I cared about and wanted the best for. She also seemed crucial to the plot. Mikael \"Kalle\" Blomvquist had no character arc. He was not a dynamic character - just a detective with no growth or change. I just didn't get it, but I slogged through for book club and the right of free expression! ...more Not sure what all the hype was about. The first 1/3 of the book showed promise. Two seperate characters who will soon cross paths. Kind of classic mystery story telling. But then it has some moments of perversity that didn't really need to be in the story.

Oh and some family members were part of the Nazi party sixty years ago. Uh ok. Not sure why that is relevant but every good mystery needs a Nazi or two I'm sure. The story brings out more sexual darkness (I can see the tourist ads now for Sweden) and disolves into a weird sexual torture/homosexual/incest tale. No Beastiality? C'mon! I feel cheated! The last 1/3 of the book was never really needed because the mystery is over and it basically takes the author 100 pages to wrap it up. Oh and we find out his longtime lover is into B&D and S&M. Why this is important? I have no idea. But it was important to Stieg. I like to call him Stieg because, even though he is dead, I feel that we are on a first name basis after the author uses \"buttplug\" in his book. It was not that great of a book. I am shocked at all the great reviews. A girlfriend of mine agreed with all the problems I had with the book yet she still loved it. This seems to be the case with many book groups. Why? I don't understand admitting the book is crap but still loving it. The end results were not remotely believable. A woman comes off a sheep ranch where she has been living for the last forty years and immediately takes over a fortune 500 type company. Uh, ok? Characters were either tossed aside quickly (then why have them?) or never developed. Another reviewer mentioned the product placement. I did find it strange that the author seemed to have a Mac fetish among many others. Also, his main character is the self appointed moral watchdog of companies (because capitalism is evil I guess) yet can't keep his zipper zipped. This book did not encourage me to visit Sweden any time soon. Also, as an Elvis fan, I did not appreciate the last line in the book. I just saw the Swedish film adaptation of the book and I actually enjoyed it. This was the first time I have ever said, \"The film was better than the book.\" Now I hear there will be an American version. Which we all know will be crap. ...more Thanks to the slew of Swedish and Hollywood movies, everyone knows that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a story of a kickass hacker Lisbeth Salander who has the eponymous tattoo and a knack for solving decades-old murders.

The original Swedish title is Men Who Hate Women and it is precisely what the story is about. (*) * I am pretty sure it received its Book Witness Protection Program name change treatment to avoid being seen as \"that feminist crap\" in the English-speaking society. Where \"feminist\" sadly may still be viewed as an insult. Apparently a teenage Larsson witnessed and failed to stop rape of a young woman. He was so affected by it that he wrote his magnum opus to make amends for the witnessed atrocity. Thus we have Men Who Hate Women , which is a short description of the focus of his entire Millenium series. Larsson speaks up - angrily, loudly, with conviction - on behalf of not just Salander but all women who have been marginalized, dismissed, paternalised, silenced, treated as inferior, treated as property, overlooked, infantilized, sexualized, assaulted, and murdered. Larsson, like his protagonist Blomkvist, was an investigative journalist who specialized in airing out stuff that many \"higher-ups\" would want to see left alone. (**) ** To quote Terry Pratchett (all bow to his genius), \"It's not worth doing something unless someone, somewhere, would much rather you weren't doing it.\" This book is an angry and poignant social commentary on the right-wing extremism, prejudice, Nazi leanings, and of course misogyny that still permeate even the quintessential European paradise country of Sweden. Larsson condemns all this, and in his journalism-like style does not hold back the slightest bit. And it is often an uncomfortable read as we see and recognize all those little societal bits and conventions that make these prejudices and even violence possible. Larsson may not be the most skillful writer, his prose may suffer from long-windedness and overabundance of details (seriously, at times it reads like a cross between a diary and a shopping catalog), but he has strong opinions on painful subjects and is not afraid to let them be known. He had this attitude both in his journalism and his fiction, and I applaud him for that. 3 stars only because of weak prose, but full marks for content. ...more One of the best thrillers I've ever read.

So if you're a purist, you might want to avoid this, but in the end I decided I liked it. I guess it's just a bit too long, and cuts were necessary. ___________________________________________ I just read the following passage in Precious Williams's review of this book, but I have seen at least half a dozen similar ones: The constant references to sandwiches (you get the impression the Swedes eat at least an entire loaf of bread every day), coffee (how on earth do they manage to sleep?) and breasts became tedious very rapidly. I can stay silent no longer. Precious and others, I lived in Sweden for most of the 80s, and I can tell that you Stieg Larsson wasn't making it up: 1. Sandwiches. Yes, you're right: Swedes love sandwiches. There's a widespread belief that eating bread is good for you. When I was there, I caught the tailend of a popular campaign by the Ministry of Health, whose tagline was \u00c4t 6-8 skivor br\u00f6d om dagen - eat 6-8 slices of bread a day. Moreover, Swedish bread is delicious. I'm thinking about kruskalimpa and r\u00e5grut right now and my mouth is watering. If they were on sale here, I'd definitely eat more sandwiches. 2. Coffee. Swedes used to drink more coffee per capita than any other county in the world, though I understand that they've now slipped a couple of places. It's powerful stuff too, but you get used to it. Fun facts: Swedish has a verb fika , meaning \"to drink coffee\" and a noun, p\u00e5t\u00e5r , meaning \"a second cup of coffee\". You know, the old Eskimo/snow thing. 3. Breasts. Topless sunbathing is popular in Sweden, and Swedes are in general extremely relaxed about nudity. Swedish men have pretty much the same interests as men everywhere else in the world.

Not even a body is found, and her great uncle, Henrik Vanger, has explored every possible lead to discover what happened to his one and only favourite family member.

Not even a body is found, and her great uncle, Henrik Vanger, has explored every possible lead to discover what happened to his one and only favourite family member. Over the last forty years her disappearance has become Henrik's obsession, and he's positive someone in the family murdered her - but they never found a motive, and without one he doesn't know who to suspect. Now, in 2005, Henrik has little time left as he grows old and plenty of money to indulge in his obsession one last time. Mikael Blomkvist is a forty-something financial journalist and editor of Millennium magazine, a magazine he co-founded which prides itself on investigative journalism. But Blomkvist and the magazine have just suffered their first big blow: he's been convicted of libel against one of the biggest business entrepreneurs in Sweden, Hans-Erik Wennerstr\u00f6m. Wanting to keep a low profile and pretend he's been fired from the magazine in order to try and save it from further attack by Wennerstr\u00f6m, Henrik Vanger's proposition comes at an ideal time. Mikael's father once worked for the Vanger Corporation, and Harriet herself had babysat little Mikael a few times. Henrik offers Blomkvist a year-long contract with the pretext of writing a history of the family - an autobiography of Henrik - while his real mission is to discover what happened to Harriet. After some convincing, Blomkvist takes the job - but when he discovers the first new evidence since the tragedy occurred, he realises he needs help - and who better to go to than the private investigator who did such a good job on Blomkvist when Henrik hired her? Lisbeth Salander is a quiet, secretive young woman who excels at what she does because she's also a genius hacker. With a troubled past and a dicey present, her trust in Blomkvist takes her by surprise. The two team up to discover the truth about Harriet, and to take Wennerstr\u00f6m down. Thanks to a friend of mine, who also recommended this to me, I knew the English translation of the original title before I started reading this, which is Men Who Hate Women . This is actually very interesting and worth mentioning. It's certainly an apt title; perhaps not obvious at first, after a while it becomes a very clear theme. It may also give it away a bit. But I can also understand why they went with a very different title for the English translation. Lisbeth is \"the girl with the dragon tattoo\" - among other tattoos and piercings - and she is one of two main characters. The second book's English title is \"The girl who played with fire\", so you can see they're going with their own theme here. More importantly, though, such a title is more appealing to an English-language audience. Titles, like covers, that feature girls or women - or wives - are popular and sell well. This is an intriguing title, and doesn't give away the genre. When this book first came out, the hardcover was marketed to a literary crowd. This is the mass market paperback edition, and with a quote from Harlan Coben on the cover along with the style of cover itself (and the long, narrow format), it is more clearly pitched at the Mystery mob (hence why both my parents-in-law read this before I did). It is a mystery, and a thriller at times, and a detective book - but it's also a political and economic commentary, has one of the more original and daring heroines of the genre, and is invigorating in its details. I don't read many mystery novels, because (ironically), I find them boring. Aside from a quiet patch at about the two-quarter mark, I never found this book boring, even though not a whole lot happens until the last third. Both Blomkvist and Salander are engaging protagonists, for very different reasons. Things happen to them that will make you upset and angry, especially Salander, whose side story holds you enthralled and revolted at the same time, as does the truth about Harriet - but there's nothing gratuitous here, or unnecessarily included or described: it's all relevant. The pacing is superb (yes, even with that \"quiet patch\"), and the plotting cleverly controlled. The cold of Sweden - at times down to -35F (which makes the 44F of Shiver seem somewhat laughable) - was vividly realised, as was the setting of Hedeby Island. I would have liked to \"see\" more of Sweden - everything was terribly familiar - but a mystery book isn't really the place for that. This is a very mature book, with themes that make you despair yet are handled so compassionately that you are never alienated. I also enjoyed the economic side of the other plot line, and Blomkvist's words towards the end were very apt considering the recent problems with the American stock exchange and subsequent recession, when he's asked by a TV host about \"the fact that Sweden's economy was now headed for a crash.\" He calls it nonsense, and goes on to explain something which I think we all tend to forget: \"You have to distinguish between two things - the Swedish economy and the Swedish stock market. The Swedish economy is the sum of all the goods and services that are produced in this country every day. There are telephones from Ericsson, cars from Volvo, chickens from Scan, and shipments from Kiruna to Sk\u00f6vde. That's the Swedish economy, and it's just as strong or weak today as it was a week ago. ... The Stock Exchange is something very different. There is no economy and no production of goods and services. There are only fantasies in which people from one hour to the next decide that this or that company is worth so many billions, more or less. It doesn't have a thing to do with reality or with the Swedish economy.\" (p819) Sure that's a simplistic way of putting it, but his description of the Stock Exchange pretty neatly sums up the way I've always perceived it - and scorned it. So I enjoyed this exchange, and the whole Wennerstr\u00f6m sub plot, as much as the mystery about Harriet itself. The other side of the commentary that's strong and interesting is the issue of journalistic responsibility, and ethics. Decisions are made at the end that are highly questionable, but there are no easy answers - Blomkvist is the voice of our conscience here, and yet you can see the other side too. I don't envy him his position! I have no complaints with this book, but I have one to the publisher: I really hate the new, narrow format of mass market paperbacks. (Thankfully, only a few books get printed like this.) They're just so tall and ... skinny. It certainly doesn't save any paper, and makes me feel like I'm falling off the edge of the page at the end of each line, which barely fits five words. I don't care for the larger typeface and roomy layout either - I like tighter lines and smaller fonts, personally. That would have saved paper! ...more **Dude, I just watched the Swedish film \"N\u00e4r m\u00f6rkret faller\" (When Darkness Falls), a crappy movie about violence in Stockholm.

I didn't think it could be done in today's fiction world, except books for the morons who feel the need to \"research\" The da Vinci Code. Time to create a new shelf for this one, entitled: kicked ass. There are several mysteries going on in this novel, from the strange disappearance of a young girl decades ago, to financial scandals in the curious backdrop of Sweden. Definitely original. The characters are fascinating and the story, engrossing. The book gets four stars for keeping me massively entertained for the better part of the week, but it loses a star for some small issues that drove me so nuts that they are worth mentioning: 1) All financial terms are reported in the Swedish kroner, which is fair considering that it's a Swedish book. However, the translator could have at least added the equivalent of Euros or Pounds or Dollars so that the majority of readers -- that is, people not familiar with the value of the Swedish currency -- don't have to go on xe.com to try to figure out just how much money we're talking about. 2) Uhhhh ... can we have an American translation, please? I TEACH ESL FROM BRITISH TEXTBOOKS, AND I STILL HAD TO TEXT MY BRITISH FRIEND AND ASK FOR DEFINITIONS. One word: Haberdashery? FABRIC STORE!!! Yeah. 3) The family tree in the first few pages helps, but the character names and places are so close that they're endlessly confusing if you're not Swedish: Henrik, Harold (who live in Hedeby near Hedestad, by the way), Harriet, Berger the lover and Birger the crazy relative, Gustav, Gregor, Gerda, Gottfried .... ARHGHG. Drove me nuts! 4) The codes in Harriet's notebook and the mystery of why Cecilia Vanger appears in every photograph = predictable. That being said, the rest of the book is such a nightmare explosion of \"who the hell saw that coming?!\" that it makes up for it. 5) \"Left-wing media liberal\" + \"socialist/communist\" Swedish dude (just quoting FOX News here) = our author, who saturates the novel with his politics. I'm a liberal, so I don't care, but when characters become the mouthpiece for your political views, you lose creativity points with me. On the whole? A great guilty-please/summer-read. Kicked ass for the most part.

Even at times when I was enjoying the plot, I felt as though I had to fight my way through dull writing. b.)

Butt plugs?! What is my reaction to that even supposed to be? (For the curious: it was a big old WTF face.) While I think there is a place for graphic rape and torture scenes (more in film than in books, because it's not as hard to convey intent in a multi-dimensional visual format), I didn't see the need for them here. Salander being the survivor of rape and perpetrator of revenge did not make me root for her here -- as it might have in a film -- because it was only a tangential and forgotten part of the story, rather than being necessary to it. We don't see her dealing with the aftereffects of her abuse at all; she's not fundamentally changed because of it, aside from taking her revenge. Which leads me to: c.) Salander's supposed to be this amazingly kickass character that I'll just automatically love, right? Umm, no. Aside from knowing that she's a good investigator, sexual but detached, has Asperger's and is kind of ruthless, I felt like she could have been anyone. Really. I looked for some piece of insight or indication that she is a dynamic character that would make me like her, but it never happened. Dressing her up like a punk in a sea of suits is not enough characterization. Perhaps in further books and with time, I'd feel attached to her like I've felt to other mystery series characters, but I'm not really tempted to read on. d.) The only reason I was invested in the mystery of Harriet Vanger's disappearance is because I thought she'd been murdered. When it turned out she was still alive and had skipped town, I wanted to throw the damn book at a wall. e.) How freaking over the top was it for the murderer to have a Hostel -style torture chamber right in his house? Does anyone find this seriously scary, instead of laughably stupid? Moreover, does this sort of thing exist outside the world of comic book super villains? Better make sure THAT room's locked when company comes over. I enjoyed this book so little that after the solution to the Harriet mystery wrapped up, I just skimmed to the end. I have no idea what happened with the Wennerstrom affair, nor do I particularly care. I'm assuming that Blomqvist got some scandalous scoop and super busted him, because that's what happens in utterly predictable books like this one. ...more Editorial meeting of Bryant Reviews Ltd Topic : book 1, Millennium series - Is everyone here? - We should start anyway. - Okay, well, we have to figure out how to review this damned Dragon Tattoo book.

The premise of the story is not so simple: Meet Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist of financial sectors, but today his accusations against industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerstrom are proved to be false hence he is fined and sentenced three months in prison for libelling. Trying to get away from his publication house for some time, he lands up at Hedeby island, with Henrik Vanger, retired CEO of Vanger corporation. Henrik asks him to solve the mystery behind murder of her niece, Harriet Vanger. Murder was committed some 36 years ago on same island where entire Vanger family was present on some occasion and island was temporarily cut off from the world due to accident on bridge, the only connecting link. So the island is isolated and there is chaos on island due to accident, and in midst of this Harriet disappears, body never found, considered dead. So what unfolds is a locked-room murder mystery . Did I miss something? Yes, Lisbeth Salander. Cold, calculated and the girl with the dragon tattoo. She works as personal investigator at a security firm, her story moves parallel to the Blomkvist\u2019s story until she is hired as detective alongside Blomkvist. Positive aspects of the story: Let me confess that this is one of the best murder mystery novel I have ever read (though I am not a fan of this genre). At no point I could guess who is the murderer, because there is no hint but when it is disclosed, it perfectly fits with the story. What makes this story even more interesting is that murder was committed 36 years ago, some people present on that day are already dead and some are too old. The characters are excellently portrayed and plus point of the story. Larsson uses subplot to develop characters over pages and pages before jumping into action. Therefore I connected with their thoughts and decisions, except Lisbeth. She has been shown differently and this makes her an interesting character, she downplays emotion and makes unpredictable moves. What went wrong with such a good story that I rated it only 3 stars. I have heard people say that bad translation can ruin a good story. Well, this sets a perfect example in that case. I\u2019m sure, if Steig Larsson could write such a good story then his prose in English would have been readable and interesting enough. What I\u2019m trying to say is, Reg Keeland (the translator) f**ked up this amazing 5 star novel to a 3 star read. I know that I love sleeping but falling asleep at the climax of the story means seriously bad writing. Another thing that this book needs other than good translator is a good editor. There is so much unnecessary excessive detailing of electronic gadgets, let me give you example, Lisbeth\u2019s laptop get run over by a vehicle and now she needs to buy a new one, so here the author goes on to give entire configuration of the laptop that was damaged and again the entire configuration of the laptop she is eyeing to buy. One more, one more, Blomkvist relocates to new house and is taking electronic items out of his bag, here each time he takes out a item, the author write about it with its BRAND NAME, Sony laptop, Sanyo sound recorder, this scanner, that portable printer. And yes, how can I forget all those coffee and sandwich(es). Throughout the entire story, the only things that the characters drank and ate were coffee and sandwich, coffee and sandwich, coffee and sandwich, coffee and sandwich. Last thing that I didn\u2019t liked was the wrap-up of subplot after the central story has already ended. After the story ended, the author goes on further 50 pages or so to put an end to Wennerstrom affair, which is highly unreadable. One thing more is that this was published as trilogy, so even when the main characters life is on line and the situation is supposed to be highly tensed, it isn\u2019t because I know that the main characters will survive because there are two books remaining ahead. Themes explored: This book is originally named- Men who hate Women, and there are many theme explored with abuse of women (in Sweden), like rape, incest, BDSM etc. Many more themes have been explored explicitly in this brilliant review by Riku . ...more Journalist Mikael Blomkvist is charged with libel and decides to take some time off from his magazine.

Someone should do a study some day about why we are pulled to certain books at certain times - the way our body pulls us toward a banana when it's running low on potassium. One of the things I loved about Larsson when I first read him (and why I return to him) is this kind of artlessness that he has about writing. There's a naturalness to the way he tells the story as if the important thing is giving you the facts as expediently as possible. Of c My second time around with Lisbeth and Blomkvist. Someone should do a study some day about why we are pulled to certain books at certain times - the way our body pulls us toward a banana when it's running low on potassium. One of the things I loved about Larsson when I first read him (and why I return to him) is this kind of artlessness that he has about writing. There's a naturalness to the way he tells the story as if the important thing is giving you the facts as expediently as possible. Of course, the facts of the story also include what he thinks is interesting about the characters thoughts, feelings, personal history. You get drawn in by this sense that author is being guided in his narration by an instinct, a scent for what is interesting to him (which he assumes will probably be interesting to you as well) and also by what you sense as his delight in discovering the very thing he's writing about as he is writing it. After he died, his life-long partner wrote that Larsson wrote his trilogy as a hobby. He was bored and wanted something fun to do. Can you imagine? I think that's why I am so attracted to his books and why I go back to them as a source of inspiration for my own writing. How beautiful to write with the passion and interest that a hobby draws from us. Yes, literature and art give meaning to our lives and there are serious messages in Larsson's books and tons of darkness. But I think his inventiveness with plot, his ability to mix reality with fiction, his creation of characters we will never forget starts with the playfulness and joy of a man finally finding a little bit of time to be alone with his hobby. ...more A book on the \"Faves\" shelf, long time no see! This book is soooo good. I love it so much, the characters are unique, flawed, compelling, the mystery is fascinating. I can't recommend this book higher to lovers of mystery and interesting characters. Nordic noir of the highest order and very entertaining. Larsson\u2019s 2005 Swedish publication M\u00e4n som hatar kvinnor \u201cMen Who Hate Women\u201d was later translated and published in English in 2008 by Steven T. Murray, by that time already an international best-seller. And for good reason. Complicated, intricate, and intelligent, Larsson\u2019s journalistic prose is crisp and logical. Filled with interesting characters, exciting scenes and this just flows very well. Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander are two Nordic noir of the highest order and very entertaining.

Filled with interesting characters, exciting scenes and this just flows very well. Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander are two of the most interesting characters in recent fiction. Larsson\u2019s great achievement, though, is not just in their creation, but in the dynamic chemistry he has fused between them. One of the best accolades that can be given a work is that it was hard to put down, and that most definitely applies here. I can easily understand why it has become so popular. ...more We shall begin with a quote from page 630 of the mass market paperback: \"Berger thought that the book was the best thing Blomkvist had ever written. It was uneven stylistically, and in places the writing was actually rather poor - there had been no time for any fine polishing - but the book was animated by a fury that no reader could help but notice.\" That quote explains perfectly how I feel about this book. An unpolished translation of an unedited book that the world collectively lost their shit We shall begin with a quote from page 630 of the mass market paperback: \"Berger thought that the book was the best thing Blomkvist had ever written. It was uneven stylistically, and in places the writing was actually rather poor - there had been no time for any fine polishing - but the book was animated by a fury that no reader could help but notice.\" That quote explains perfectly how I feel about this book. An unpolished translation of an unedited book that the world collectively lost their shit over. It goes without saying, if you want insta-success, you need to die (or fake your death, but more on that later) and leave behind a)secret paintings b) proof of sexual escapades with some celebrity c) a buncha manuscripts no one knew you were working on. The author died on November 1st 2004 and the first publication of this book was on January 1st, 2005. They really shoved this novel out, don'tcha think? Shortly after Stieg Larsson passed away, three completed novels were found. Those novels were then published. I don't know about the rest of the series, but this joker is most definitely a first draft. Superfluous detail like character histories that take up whole pages only for that character to never be heard from again, meandering chapters that bring up stuff never again touched upon, page after page of coffee (thanks a heap to Tobin for pointing that shit out because after he mentioned it, I realized there's nary a chapter without someone starting, drinking, or tossing out a pot of coffee). Larsson bit the big one after climbing seven flights of stairs because the elevator in his office building was broken. That's sad, because I would have liked to have read a streamlined version of this book. Which brings me to my next point... The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is actually two books. You have one book that's really quite interesting. This first book gives us the reason everyone lost their shit over it: Lisbeth Salander. Strong women like her are hard to find, and when you do find them, they are without hangups. Salander is fucked up, but keeps on doing her thing. Every scene with her in it is great. Unfortunately, she's strapped to the helm of a truly by-the-numbers cold-case thriller. I like that there's no damsel-in-distress moment in this book, but other than that, this plot and payoff have been done ad nauseam. Which brings me to book two... A financial thriller with a heavy dose of journalistic integrity morals. I don't give a fuck about that part of the story, so I choose not to comment on it, other than to say, Wennerstr\u00f6m was never a threat. All that shit happened on the back burner, and it felt like the novel slogged trying to tie up a fuck load of loose strings that I couldn't be bothered to care about. This is, by far, the worst translation I've ever read. There are several places where the translator gave not a single fuck and just threw in what he thought the author might have meant. This is another problem with publishing posthumously. I almost want to read the original Swedish text to see what the author actually wrote. And because it's bound to come up if I don't cite my reasoning behind why I think the translator just gave up at certain parts, I provide the jury with two examples: Example #1: \"an apology of a desk\" Perhaps the author meant: \"a sorry excuse for a desk\" Example #2: \"a common and garden bastard\" Perhaps the author meant: \"a garden variety bastard\" Oh, and I see why Daniel Craig was cast as Blomkvist for the 'Murican version of this book's adaptation. Like Craig's other popular character, James Bond, Blomkvist gets more strange than Wilt Chamberlain. Dude fucks all three of the main females in this book. The only reason he didn't fuck Harriet Vanger was because... oops, sorry can't tell you because spoilers! Anyfart, the only way I'll be reading the rest of these doorstops is if someone can assure me we find out more about Salander's past. I'd be willing to slog through another 2,000 pages just to find out more about her. She's the only reason I gave this tired, bloated, posthumously-published-and-unpolished novel three stars instead of two. Because I like her. The rest of the book? Meh. One final bit that's sure to pis some people off: I'm a conspiracy theorist at heart, and I kinda think Larsson faked his death. He was receiving death threats before he died of a heart attack and had been in hiding. What better way to disappear than to have the proceeds from a book to start a new life with. I'm sure Larsson, Tupac, and Elvis are all riding around the Swiss Alps on golden snow mobiles, drinking Orphan Tear vodka, and fucking busty Yetis. In summation: Fuck 50% of this book. Fuck Blomkvist. Fuck Berger. Fuck Armansky, Henrik, and Frode. Especially fuck Cecilia, who was there because... I don't know why. To be fucked by Blomkvist, I guess. Fuck 'em all, aside from Salander. She's cool, and makes this book worth a read if you need to win a bet or someone's kidnapped your poodle and the ransom is you must read this thing by that one dead guy. Final Judgment: A common and garden bastard. If any of you think I've been insensitive in my review and feel you want to ask how I would feel if someone ragged on my work after I died, I'd tell you that I wouldn't give a shit. You know, because I'd be fucking dead. ...more I\u2019ve been hearing a lot about how good the Swedish mystery writers are, and if this book is any indication, I\u2019m moving to Stockholm and learning the language because I want to get close to the source. I\u2019m usually wary when the hype around a book reaches huge proportions and this novel has been a worldwide phenomenon even before I started seeing it all over the bookstores here in America. But this is one example of when the furor is justified. There are two main characters. Mikael Blomkvist, a vet I\u2019ve been hearing a lot about how good the Swedish mystery writers are, and if this book is any indication, I\u2019m moving to Stockholm and learning the language because I want to get close to the source. I\u2019m usually wary when the hype around a book reaches huge proportions and this novel has been a worldwide phenomenon even before I started seeing it all over the bookstores here in America. But this is one example of when the furor is justified. There are two main characters. Mikael Blomkvist, a veteran financial reporter, and Lisbeth Salander, an anti-social punk with a part-time job as a researcher at a security firm. When the book begins, Blomkvist has just lost a libel case where he had written about criminal wrong doing by a prominent industrialist, Hans-Erik Wennerstr\u00f6m. With his reputation in ruins and the magazine he co-owns on the brink of collapse, Blomkvist is summoned to Hedeby Island by Henrik Vanger, the patriarch of a wealthy family. Henrik wants to commission Blomkvist to write a family history, but that\u2019s just a cover story. Henrik\u2019s niece, Harriet, vanished while on Hedeby Island in the early 1960s during a day when the island was cut off from the mainland due to a massive traffic accident on its only bridge. It's the ultimate locked room (or locked island) mystery. Over 30 years of investigation have convinced Henrik that Harriet was murdered, very possibly by someone in the Vanger family, and he wants Blomkvist to comb through the massive amount of material he\u2019s collected and see if he can find anything new about the case. Blomkvist is hesitant, but Henrik not only offers to help cover his financial problems due to the libel case and with the failing magazine, he also claims to have evidence that would prove that Wennerstr\u00f6m is a criminal and will help clear Blomkvist\u2019s reputation. Blomkvist agrees and moves to Hedeby Island to begin the research. As this is going on, a parallel story revolving around Lisbeth Salander is also being told. Salander is so anti-social that she can barely function in society and has to endure legal guardianship by the state since it decided that she\u2019s incapable of managing her own life. However, Salander is really a brilliant researcher and computer genius who just can't stand people. Originally hired by Henrik Vanger to vet Blomkvist, Salander becomes intrigued with Blomkvist\u2019s libel case and begins checking out Wennerstr\u00f6m on her own. However, changes in her legal status concerning her guardianship soon present her with severe problems in her own life. There were several things I loved about this book, and one of them is the leisurely pace it has for the first half. Most of this portion consists of Blomkvist sitting in a cabin on Hedeby Island reading about Harriet while Salander is in a desperate struggle to reassert some independence against her new guardian. The key part of the mystery about Harriet really doesn\u2019t pick up until the second half of the novel, but it didn\u2019t bother me a bit. I was so caught up in the story that I was perfectly happy to let it unfold as slowly as it wanted. I also loved the characters. Blomkvist is a great reporter and a very decent man, but he can also be selfish and a bit of a shit. The book doesn\u2019t pull any punches in indicating that he isn\u2019t a good father and is a bit too casual in his relationships with women. Salander is unfriendly and lacks any social graces at all so she should be unpleasant to read about. But even before the book engages your sympathy for her due to an extremely bad situation she finds herself in, I couldn\u2019t help but like the damaged girl who has such an anti-authority streak that she refuses to ask for help from the police or lawyers when she has every right and reason to. She\u2019d rather handle her problems herself than engage an authority figure, and she\u2019s got a mean streak. Another thing I liked is that even though this was written before the worldwide 2008 financial implosion, the author Stieg Larsson, who was a financial reporter in Sweden, uses the subplot about Wennerstr\u00f6m to illustrate how he felt that financial reporters were entirely too close to the financial bigwigs and no real investigative reporting was being done. Recent revelations about guys like Bernie Madoff makes it clear that Larsson was ringing an alarm bell. Too bad no one listened. Fair warning for those considering reading. The original Swedish title of this book is Men Who Hate Women, and you\u2019ll see why if you read it. Although not overly explicit, there are several segments dealing with rape and sexual assault. Larsson apparently wrote mysteries as a hobby and had completed three but hadn\u2019t tried to publish them until shortly before his death a few years ago. I\u2019m already bummed that there are only going to be two more of these terrific books by him to read. ...more \"Todo el mundo tiene secretos.

En el libro diferenciamos f\u00e1cilmente tres historias: la prime \"Todo el mundo tiene secretos. Es solo cuesti\u00f3n de tiempo descubrir cuales son.\" \u201cLos hombres que no amaban es la mujeres\u201d demuestra c\u00f3mo debe estar construido un buen misterio: te dan todas las pistas, pero te toca a ti descifrarlas y, s\u00ed es la primera vez que te acercas a esta historia, no tienes oportunidad de adivinarlo y Larsson estar\u00e1 ri\u00e9ndose por c\u00f3mo te devanas los sesos mientras te recuerda que el diablo est\u00e1 en los detalles. En el libro diferenciamos f\u00e1cilmente tres historias: la primera es la batalla de Mikael con Wennerstrom, la segunda es resolver que sucedi\u00f3 Harriet, y la tercera es tratar de descubrir quien carajos es Lisbeth. Todas ellas se juntan para dar el cierre el libro teniendo la segunda de ellas el mejor final, m\u00e1s explosivo e inesperado, y las otras dos son finales insatisfactorios y un tanto acelerados, pero en conjunto se logra un muy buen esp\u00e9cimen dentro de la novela de misterio. Algo a destacar es que en realidad las tres est\u00e1n muy bien construidas, tienen sus vueltas de tuerca y mantienen interesado al lector, a pesar de que conforme se van tejiendo la lectura no es ligera, de hecho es del tipo que sutilmente exige la atenci\u00f3n del lector en un 100% y que, si te va gustando, se la das sin poner un pero. Tal vez el mayor detalle por el cual puede no gustarle a todo el mundo es el hecho de que se toquen temas bastante espinosos, de hecho Vargas Llosa afirma que en estos libros Suecia es \u201duna sucursal del infierno, donde los jueces prevarican, los psiquiatras torturan, los polic\u00edas y esp\u00edas delinquen, los pol\u00edticos mienten, los empresarios estafan, y tanto las instituciones y el establishment en general parecen presa de una pandemia de corrupci\u00f3n de proporciones pri\u00edstas o fujimoristas\u201d , pero esa concepci\u00f3n de parte Suecia es parte del porque esta novela es tan buena, dado que muestra el sobreponerse a un sistema degradado y salir victorioso, pero no por ello salier indemne. Y claro, quienes logran esto son los personajes. La primera vez que le\u00ed Lisbeth Salander era una reinterpretaci\u00f3n de \u201cPippi, Calzaslargas\u201d me sorprend\u00ed \u00bfQu\u00e9 similitud pod\u00edan tener? Luego, cuando lo pens\u00e9 m\u00e1s lo entend\u00ed: tienen en com\u00fan que todos esperan que sean fr\u00e1giles, pero que son fuertes e independientes, que saben defenderse y no dan vuelta atr\u00e1s y que, sin importar que tengan amigos o personas que las aprecien, son unas marginadas que no encajan en este mundo. Ella es el personaje m\u00e1s enigm\u00e1tico, y termina opacando a Mikael por sus dotes donde ella pasa a ser, muy al estilo de las pel\u00edculas de los 90 e igualmente muy alejada de las mismas por el hecho de ser mujer, la hero\u00edna que no encaja pero que inesperadamente siempre salva el d\u00eda. Es el tipo de personaje del que siempre deseas saber m\u00e1s, ver en lo m\u00e1s profundo de su ser y, el hecho de que esto sea una trilog\u00eda (tetralog\u00eda), no te permite conocerla del todo pero si lo suficiente para intrigarte y, alegremente, ver el crecimiento que tendr\u00e1 el personaje. (view spoiler) [aqu\u00ed digo crecimiento porque personalmente consider\u00f3 que el hecho de enamorarse o dejar a alguien acercarse no la hace menos fuerte, ni menos interesante, simplemente demuestra que no es una piedra como al principio parece. Dejarnos ser vulnerables tambi\u00e9n muestra que estamos dispuestos a madurar, sin que eso defina al personaje, (hide spoiler) ] Despu\u00e9s esta Mikael Blomkvist, que es un personaje que por momentos es interesante y por momentos plano, pero que al final est\u00e1 bastante bien construido, demuestra la figura de lo que un periodista debe ser y sufre, pero igualmente no se olvida de s\u00ed mismo, es un ser humano como cualquiera, guiado por sus pasiones y sentimientos, pero sin olvidarse del cerebro. No es el macho alpha de la historia, pero tampoco es la v\u00edctima; no es un verdugo ni un santo. De hecho los matices, sus motivaciones y sus habilidades son las que tendr\u00eda cualquier individuo de a pie y es lo que lo hace destacar en esta historia. Al final creo que este libro es bastante bueno, tiene algunos defectos como la cantidad de p\u00e1ginas que deben pasar para que Lisbeth y Mikael realmente trabajen juntos, porque ah\u00ed es donde la historia se torna m\u00e1s din\u00e1mica y emocionante (no porqu\u00e9 se conocen, sino por todo lo que se descubre para ese punto) o los problemas de faldas de Mikael, pero eso queda opacado por todas las virtudes del mismo. P.D. \u00bfAlguien m\u00e1s cree que Henrik Vanger es un HDP como todo el resto de su familia?
