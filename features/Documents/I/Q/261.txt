In the past this hasn't been a success. He loves to be read to in person, both picture books and chapter books. But he not a fan of listening to books in the car. At best he's indifferent, but usually he just asks me to turn them off. Generally speaking, he'd prefer to listen to Macklemore's Thrift Shop, which he calls \"The Sway Music.\" But he's four now, with a vocabulary that's diverse to the point of being a little creepy. (<---B>I taught him \"cruft\" yesterday.</---B>) So I plugged in the Audio of Gaiman's Graveyard book. For those of you who don't know, Gaiman reads his own audiobooks more often than not. Lovely accent aside, he's fucking amazing at it.<---F> Really irritatingly good</---F>. We listened to it for about 10 minutes or so,<---M> then I heard him saying</---M>, \"Dad? Dad!\" from the back seat. I sighed and turned it off, I expected him to tell me that this was boring and we should stop. Or that he wanted to listen to the Sway Music or one of his, as he puts it \"Kid CD's.\" But it wasn't anything of the sort, instead he said. \"Dad! I'm listening to the story and I can see the pictures in my head!\" \"Really?\" I asked. \"Yeah,\" he says. \"It's like a movie!\" I couldn't be happier. <---A>Neil Gaiman</---A> as his first audio. My boy has good taste. \"What does it look like in your head?\" I ask. \"There's a hill, and on the top of it there is a fence and a graveyard!\" We talk about the story for a little bit. He's slightly confused on some points: he thinks the boy's name is Jack, and he thought that the man who was coming to hurt the boy was invisible except for his hand. (Which is understandable, given the way Gaiman describes things, focusing on the hand and the knife.) But generally he was getting it. More importantly, he was enjoying it. I know this because for the next couple days, whenever we got into the car, he asked if we could listen to \"the story of the boy that lived in the graveyard.\" Yes, yes we can. ...more I\u2019ve noticed that there\u2019s been an increased interest in the macabre in children\u2019s literature lately.

Is the violence of the world today trickling down into our entertainment? Hogwash and poppycock and other words of scoff and denial, says sober I. But I\u2019ve certainly seen a distinct rise in the Gothic and otherworldly over the last few years, and one wonders if it\u2019s because kids want more of that kind of stuff or publishers are merely getting less squeamish. All that aside, generally I\u2019ll read a May Bird book or an Everlost title and they\u2019ll be fun examinations of the hereafter, but not the kind of things that touch my heart. Great writing doesn\u2019t have to transcend its genre. It just has to be emotionally honest with the reader. And <+++>The Graveyard Book</+++> is one of the most emotionally honest books I\u2019ve yet to have read this year. Smart and focused, touching and wry, it takes the story of a boy raised by ghosts and extends it beyond the restrictive borders of the setting. Great stuff. It starts with three murders. There were supposed to be four. The man Jack was one of the best, maybe THE best, and how hard is it to kill a toddler anyway? But on that particular night the little boy went for a midnight toddle out the front door while the murderer was busy and straight into the nearby graveyard. Saved and protected by the denizens of that particular abode (the ghosts and the far more corporeal if mysterious Silas), the little boy is called Bod, short for Nobody because no one knows his name. As he grows older, Bod learns the secrets of the graveyard, though he has to be careful. The man (or is it \u201cmen\u201d?) who killed his family could come back for him. Best to stay quiet and out of sight. Yet as Bod grows older it becomes clear that hiding may not be the best way to confront his enemies. And what\u2019s more, Bod must come to grips with what it means to grow up. Can I level with you? You know Coraline ? Mr. Gaiman\u2019s previous foray into middle grade children\u2019s literature. Come close now, I don\u2019t want to speak too loudly. Uh... I didn\u2019t much care for it. WAIT! Come back, come back, I didn\u2019t mean it! Well, maybe I did a tad. It was a nice book. A sufficient story. But it was very much (new category alert) an adult-author-to-children\u2019s-author-first-timer-title. Gaiman appeared to be finding his sealegs with Coraline . He took the old Alice in Wonderland trope which adult authors naturally gravitate to on their first tries (see: Un Lun Dun , Summerland , The King in the Window , etc.). Throw in some rats, bees, and buttons, and voila! Instant success. But Coraline for all its readability and charm didn\u2019t get me here [thumps chest:]. I didn\u2019t feel emotionally close to the material. Now why it should be that I\u2019d feel closer emotionally to a book filled with a plethora of ghosts, ghouls, night-gaunts, and Hounds of God, I can only chalk up to <+++>The Graveyard Book</+++> 's strong vision. My husband likes to say that the whole reason Buffy the Vampire Slayer worked as a television show was that it was a natural metaphor for the high school (and eventually college) experience. Likewise, The Graveyard Book has this strong,strange, wonderful metaphor about kids growing up, learning about the wider world, and exploring beyond the safe boundaries of their homes. There's so much you can read into this book. I mean, aren\u2019t all adults just ghosts to kids anyway? Those funny talking people whose time has passed but that may provide some shelter and wisdom against the wider, crueler world. Plus Mr. Gaiman also includes characters in Bod's world that kids will wish they had in their own. Silas, a man who may be a vampire (though the word is never said) is every child's fantasy; A mysterious/magical guardian/friend who will tell you the truth when your parents will not. One thing I particularly liked about the book was the fact that Bod makes quite a few careless or thoughtless mistakes and yet you don\u2019t feel particularly inclined to throttle him because of them. Too often in a work of fiction a person isn\u2019t properly put into the head of their protagonist. So when that character walks off and does something stupid there\u2019s the sense (sometimes faint, sometimes not) that they deserved it and you\u2019re not going to stick around and read about somebody that dumb, are you? But even when Bod is at his most intolerable, his most childishly selfish and single-minded, you can understand and sympathize with him. Bod is no brat, a fact that implies right there that he is someone worth rooting for. We see our own young selves in Bod, and we root for him as a result. And as Bod reaches each stage in his growth, he encounters experiences and personalities that help him to reach maturity. That\u2019s a lot to put on the plate of a l\u2019il ole fantasy novel, particularly one that\u2019s appropriate for younger kids. And it is appropriate too. Don\u2019t let the fact that the first sentence in the book (\u201cThere was a hand in the darkness, and it held a knife\u201d) put you off. The murder of Bod\u2019s family is swift, immediate, and off-screen. What remains is just a great fantasy novel that has the potential to appeal to both boy and girl readers. Kid wants a ghost story? Check. Kid wants a fantasy novel set in another world appropriate for Harry Potter fans? Check. Kid wants a \u201cgood book\u201d. That\u2019s my favorite request. When the eleven-year-old comes up to my desk and begs for \u201ca good book\u201d I can just show them the cover and the title of this puppy and feel zero guilt when their little eyes light up. A good book it is. I guess that if I have any objections at all to the title it has something to do with the villains. They\u2019re a bit sketchy, which I suppose is the point, but we live in an era where children\u2019s fantasy novels spend oodles of time defining their antagonists\u2019 motivations and histories. Gaiman\u2019s more interested in his hero, which is natural, but the villains\u2019 raison d\u2019\u00eatre is just a bit too vague for the average reader. Honestly, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that Bod\u2019s family is slaughtered at the start of this tale you wouldn\u2019t necessarily know whether or not to believe that these people are as nasty as we've been told. That said the book\u2019s a peach. I once heard someone postulate that maybe Neil Gaiman wrote it just so that he could play with the sentence \u201cIt takes a graveyard to raise a child.\u201d Unlikely. Fun, but unlikely. I mean, he does make a casual allusion that isn\u2019t far off from that phrase, but he never goes whole hog. This book doesn\u2019t feel like it was written to back up a joke. It feels like a book written by a parent with children growing up and moving out. It\u2019s a title that tips its hat to kids making their way in the world, their pasts behind them, their futures unknown. This is not yet another silly little fantasy novel, but something with weight and depth. The fact that it just happens to be loads of fun to boot is simply a nice bonus. Highly recommended. Ages 10 and up. ...more It takes a graveyard to raise a child. This is a summary of this magical, sweet and imaginative story for children, which ( in a good tradition of the Brothers Grimm ) started with a triple homicide. \u201cThere was a hand in the darkness, and it held a knife.\u201d Neil Gaiman does not waste time with unicorns and princesses and butterflies which are often considered acceptable for children.

He kicks off his book with the brutal murders of a child's entire family, written in a chilling tone that made me quickly turn all the lights on in my bedroom. <---C>Nobody Owens</---C> (named so because \"he looks like nobody but himself\" ), or simply Bod, is the sole survivor of the aforementioned triple homicide, who is, in The Jungle Book style, promptly adopted by a sweet ghost couple in the graveyard inhabited by an afterlife community. He even gets a vampire as his guardian and mentor - \u201cThere were people you could hug, and then there was Silas.\u201d Given the Privilege of the Graveyard and taught how to Fade into the background, Bod spends his entire childhood playing among graves, learning his letters from the gravestones, running into trouble with some ghouls, being tutored by a werewolf with a taste for Eastern European food, dancing with Death, and making friends with the ghost of a young witch burned at stake. He does crave human company though, and in addition to becoming an \"imaginary friend\" of a little girl also does a brief stint as a non-so-ordinary student at a school. All this while the evil that tried to murder him in the first place is still searching for him. Neil Gaiman has a real knack for the imaginative combination of sweet and creepy elements together with the bittersweet ending, creating a unique and unforgettable story which appeals both to children and adults. Told via a succession of interludes from Bod's unusual life, the story could have been overly sugary or overly morbid, but Gaiman easily avoids either extreme. This story has just the right mix of sweetness, whimsy, sadness, suspense, and adventures to keep the reader captivated throughout. Bod said, 'I want to see life. I want to hold it in my hands. I want to leave a footprint on the sand of a desert island. I want to play football with people. I want,' he said, and then he paused and he thought. 'I want everything.' Seeing the world depicted through the eyes of a quiet graveyard-raised but very human boy colors the story with almost Bradbury-esque feeling of nostalgia for the fleeting magic of childhood. We see the inevitable process of growing up, finding one's self, and letting go of the comforts of childhood home written poignantly and sweetly, and yet without overkill. \u201cYou're alive, Bod. That means you have infinite potential. You can do anything, make anything, dream anything. If you can change the world, the world will change. Potential. Once you're dead, it's gone. Over. You've made what you've made, dreamed your dream, written your name. You may be buried here, you may even walk. But that potential is finished.\u201d Bod is a great character for a children's story. He is smart and resourceful, quiet and observant, loyal and brave, somewhat mischievous, and ultimately very life-like. His demeanor reminds me of my awesome younger brother, actually. Watching him grow up from a sweet child into what seems to be an actual good adult is a pleasure. \u201cYou're brave. You are the bravest person I know, and you are my friend. I don't care if you are imaginary.\u201d This story, even though wonderfully complete, still reads almost like a tease at times. Gaiman gives us a delightful and lyrical glimpse into the world which I would love to get to know better. He creates such rich captivating characters that even after the book is over I am left longing for more. I would love to read a whole another book dedicated to Silas or Miss Lupescu or Lizzy the witch. (Mr. Gaiman, if you ever run out of other book ideas... just sayin'!) ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5 stars and a well-earned spot on my \"for my future (hypothetical) daughter\" reading shelf. \"There was a smile dancing on his lips, although it was a wary smile, for the world is a bigger place than a little graveyard on a hill; and there would be dangers in it and mysteries, new friends to make, old friends to rediscover, mistakes to be made and many paths to be walked before he would, finally, return to the graveyard or ride with the Lady on the broad back of her great grey stallion. But between now and then, there was Life; and Bod walked into it with his eyes and his heart wide open.\" ...more I just don't think Neil Gaiman can write something I won't enjoy. His worlds are so rich and visceral, his characters so unique and loveable. I loved this story, loved Bod with all my heart, and was proud of him as he grew up.

Bod's life in the graveyard is very interesting, with him learning various bits of magic and magical lore from the dead. With hundreds of ghosts spanning several thousand years there's all manner of opportunity for interest and I enjoyed Bod's interactions with them. We watch Bod grow up, be educated, and make ventures into the living world. The whole thing crept up on me. I was gently entertained throughout but by the end I found myself really caring about the story. The end was really quite emotional in that Toy Story III sort of 'leaving the nest' way that punches parents in the gut. I think Celyn got a bit irritated as I kept pausing to gather myself to read the next line. Anyway. A curious and highly entertaining book thick with inventiveness and written with deceptive skill. ...more This is how it usually goes with me and Neil Gaiman books: Scene: at the library.

Again, the idea is interesting - a toddler's family is killed, and he's raised in a graveyard by ghosts - but Gaiman's books have seemed interesting to me before. So it's with gratitude that I say: Finally. FINALLY! To me, this book (at long last) connected. I loved the characters and the concept, and the actual text seemed to flow and be more engaging than the previous books I'd read. I'm glad I gave Gaiman's books one more last chance after the last last chance. I may even try one more. ...more I've got a doctor's appointment scheduled for Monday.

Maybe that's inevitable being that most of the characters in it are dead. It's not that the writing isn't good. Gaiman's stories generally aren't to blame, either, in fact there are some flashes of real ingenuity in some of them. Coraline and Stardust have been standouts for me personally in this respect. I have noticed that sometimes the scene description is lacking. There have been moments in the middle of a page where I've stopped and said \"wait, where is this happening?\" and when I \"look around\" all I see are a couple characters in a room about as decorative as the inside of this text block I'm writing in right now. But those aren't common occurrences and they're certainly not enough to sour the whole book. I don't know, if the doctor can't help me maybe I'll seek a second opinion from the librarian. ...more Once there was a little girl who lived in a big house in a strange and wonderful city in the North.

Her name: Dove Black*. An unusual name for an unusual girl. Her equally unusual mother took her away for the summer, across the sea. I came to that strange and wonderful city and stayed in that big house. In the house was a book. The Graveyard Book! I fell prey to an odd illness during my visit; while my companions made merry in the streets and taverns of that city, I recovered on the wide and sunny porch of that house, the clucks of chickens from the chicken coop and the laughter of the children playing on the street making me feel rather less lonely. I took The Graveyard Book down from the shelf and read it. It was perfect company. Indeed, it is a perfect book! I\u2019ll dispense with much of a synopsis because you can read that anywhere. An infant is taken in by a graveyard full of ghosts (and more); they raise him as their ward and son. As he grows up, young Nobody Owens learns a lot about death and a little bit about life as well. Gaiman notes The Jungle Book as an inspiration; I\u2019m not sure I would have thought of Kipling\u2019s classic myself but after reading that comment, it makes perfect sense, title and all. There, done with synopsis. Many times I felt as if the book was tailor-made for a young mark monday, what with the eerie atmosphere, the ambiguity, the graveyard, adventure mixed with sadness, life and death existing side by side, and at the core of it all, an unusual and genuinely loving family \u2013 but a created family, not necessarily a family by blood. All those things appealed to me at a pretty deep level as a kid, which is probably why I really loved Bellair\u2019s The House With a Clock in Its Walls as well. I wish this book had been around when I was younger; I can easily picture connecting to it in so many different ways. But I\u2019m an adult and I still feel a deep connection to the book. All those things above are still things that connect me to a novel, of course, but my feelings about many of those things have intensified. The idea of a \u2018created\u2019 family, one that can come together for a variety of reasons but one that will look out for and support and love its members, one that embraces the difference of the individuals within that family\u2026 so meaningful to me! It\u2019s an idea that I didn\u2019t start experiencing until my early 20s, oh the life of a quasi-punk cynical jerk outsider who suddenly realizes that there are others out there like him, happy sigh, and it\u2019s an idea that I feel like I\u2019ve tried to carry on with my adult circle of friends and within my work place. It\u2019s actually why I even chose my place of work. The Graveyard Book offers this found family as meaningful and valid and beautiful, much as The Jungle Book did. Gaiman doesn\u2019t bluntly pound the point home and he isn\u2019t mawkish or even all that sentimental about it all \u2013 but it is such a central part of what makes the novel work. And it is also what makes the ending such a sweet and sad one. Sometimes, perhaps always, you do need to move on. Some things are transitory. Sometimes those families that you spent so much time with melt away and stay on only as memories. But you can always make those families again! Yes. Ambiguity: I love it and I yearn for it in books. The feeling that the author doesn\u2019t want to spell things out for you, that they realize the reader may gain pleasure from figuring things out on their own, filling in the blanks, imagining why something may have happened and what may come next. Not being spoon-fed every little detail and not tying it all up with a neat little bow. It seems like an easy thing to be able to do but I think many authors just don\u2019t want to do that. Perhaps they don\u2019t realize there is a sort of tyranny in excessive detail, in paths made painfully clear and obvious, fluorescent lighting rather than shadows and moonlight, endings that explain it all away instead of showing a newly opened door \u2013 an ending that leads to a beginning. That is one of the beautiful things about this book, that kind of an ending and the ambiguity of it all. Sure, it explained many things. But it left many doors open, for the reader to step through and explore on their own. Maybe this is also why I appreciate books written for children and young adults: because of the basic form of the genre, the actual length of such books, perhaps even because of the attention span of the audience\u2026 things often have to be left to the reader\u2019s imagination. I like simplicity that creates mystery, simplicity that is its own form of depth. \u201cHello,\u201d he said, as he danced with her. \u201cI don\u2019t know your name.\u201d \u201cNames aren\u2019t really important,\u201d she said. \u201cI love your horse. He\u2019s so big! I never knew horses could be that big.\u201d \u201cHe is gentle enough to bear the mightiest of you away on his broad back, and strong enough for the smallest of you as well.\u201d \u201cCan I ride him?\u201d asked Bod. \u201cOne day,\u201d she told him, and her cobweb skirts shimmered. \u201cOne day. Everybody does.\u201d \u201cPromise?\u201d \u201cI promise.\u201d Death is not the end! I don\u2019t know if I believe in ghosts or heaven or a cosmic consciousness that we all float into. But I do believe in the somewhat corny We All Live On In Some Way, whether it be as memories or as influences or as just one more part of humanity that is connected to the rest of humanity because we are all humans. I dunno. The Graveyard Book literalizes that concept, of course. It does it in a way that can make sense to both children and adults \u2013 showing how things are forgotten, perhaps, and that\u2019s not so bad really, and it does it by showing how we live on in each other, by the things we do and the people we care for. Is Gaiman a spiritual man? Surely he must be. There is a certain kind of spirituality to much of his fiction, an ease with and an interest in describing worlds that are larger than us \u2013 and yet he makes that greater world rather wonderfully prosaic, real, worlds we could actually live in, somehow. Some may think such things are depressing \u2013 or that a book that is set in a graveyard and that opens with death and where the dead live next to the living, all of that, that that is a depressing book. To me, it is the opposite of depressing. Death is a part of life; there would be no life without death. This book for children recognizes that and even, amazingly, celebrates it. The book certainly knows how to illustrate Growing Up. Each chapter is a step forward, a snapshot of Nobody Owens as he grows up. At the end, it captures that wistfulness, that sweet sadness at the knowledge that growing up means you may never look at things the same way again, you can never go home again and if you do, that home will be a different place. That home may be a physical place, it may be a group of people or even just one person, it may be a feeling of being protected or a place where you learned and grew and loved and lived in a particular way. Good things to cry over. The tears may be melancholy ones, wistful tears \u2013 but yet not depressing ones, not to me at least. If anything, they affirm life. And growing up, or moving on, or going down new paths\u2026 it is also an adventure. I love how the ending makes that perfectly clear. Sure, shed some tears over what has passed and can never be again, but know that the future is still a path that can lead you to all sorts of places. It doesn\u2019t matter how old you are \u2013 old Silas is about to go on his own adventure too. And so Nobody is sad and moves on and is happy and moves on and he jumps onto that path and moves on. Trudi said in her review \u201cGaiman reminds me of why I love to read and I love him for that.\u201d Yes, Trudi, yes! Very well said. After I finished the book, I looked through Dove Black\u2019s bookshelves and found many things that I loved. A lot of Philip Pullman, Susan Cooper\u2019s Dark Is Rising series, Narnia, books by Edward Eager and Louise Fitzhugh and Colin Maloy and Garth Nix, and of course Harry Potter and The Hunger Games. I admire your taste, Dove Black. I hope all of these books have informed your world view. But how could they not? They must. Your mother put your paintings and your awards on the wall and she should be proud: you are a talented young lady. I think you will grow up to be an equally impressive adult. I wish you the best of luck! But I really don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it. ____________ * A real little girl but of course not her real name.

Also, I'm willing to accept a large amount of non-sensical information in a fantasy novel, but there has to be some sort of explanation behind it. For example--if a boy lives in a graveyard his entire life, what happens if he needs to go to the dentist or take a shower or get vaccinated? Somehow, everyone reacts completely normally to the protagonist, even though he must be a filthy, smelly toothless wreck. Also, at the end of the book, the ghosts just kind of release the main character into the world--the boy who is only 15 and has had almost no formal schooling in his entire life. What is this kid supposed to do with himself? He's been getting his education from people who've been deceased for at least 150 years and has nothing on him but a little money and a passport. Yeah, I'm sure he'll do REALLY well on his own. Anyway, I didn't think it was a bad book, but it certainly wasn't a good one, and it was WAY below Neil Gaiman's usual standards. ...more I read the first chapter with a massive grin on my face because it was so obvious where this book was going, and it sounded marvellous. \u201cI do.

It saved his life. The local graveyard residents name him Nobody because, by their logic he is nobody. The residents, the ghosts, decide to raise him as one of their own; the only problem is he isn\u2019t dead! They try to teach him things like disappearing and repapering, and other ghostly tricks. This doesn\u2019t come easy to him but, somehow he manages to grasp some of the basics, which include remaining hidden in crowds and how detach himself from other people. This results in Bid becoming a bookish like recluse; his only friends are the dead. This sounds worse than it is when considering some of the exciting characters than infest the Graveyard. Characters like a druidic warrior that protects the barrow next to the yard and a long dead Roman called Silas. Silas serves as Bod\u2019s guardian, his teacher and his friend.

This really is one of those rare books that you can tell from the first few pages, no words, that it is going to be something great. I loved this book ; I don\u2019t think I stopped smiling when I read it. The story really appealed to my inner child like so few books have done before. I think it\u2019s time to buy more of Neil Gaiman\u2019s books! ...more You can say what you want about Neil Gaiman, but he certainly knows how to write engaging stories. The Graveyard Book introduces us to Nobody Owens, nicknamed Bod, who survives as a toddler while his family is murdered in a gruesome act of violence.

The Graveyard Book introduces us to Nobody Owens, nicknamed Bod, who survives as a toddler while his family is murdered in a gruesome act of violence. Bod escapes to a nearby graveyard and is taken in by the ghosts who are condemned to remain forever at the place their bodies were buried. The weird plot requires some time getting used to, which the author doesn't really allow us because the story soon sees Bod growing into a curious boy and later into an adventurous teenager. Neil Gaiman's success partly rests on his very own niche in the fantasy genre he managed to create, a fusion of classic fantasy stories, Kafkaesque plot details and coming-of-age tales. It is easy to discover Gaiman's personal style inside his books; some of his ideas are so grotesque that hardly any author person would be able to come up with something like this ... and turn it into a captivating tale enthralling thousands of readers. In The Graveyard Book , Gaiman soon develops a rather dark atmosphere even more memorable than it was in Coraline or The Ocean at the End of the Lane , but it is difficult to connect with any of the characters in the beginning. Some parts dragged on and became boring, before the end ultimately made up for everything and allowed the book to conclude in a breathtaking, spectacular finale. Gaiman himself pointed out in the afterword that his novel is basically a retelling of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book mixed with darker elements, the most significant difference being that the protagonist was raised by ghosts rather than a pack of wolves. The book was structured in such a way that it allowed us to focus on one specific period or moment in Bod's life with every chapter, which resulted in a huge diversity of topics the novel deals with because Gaiman never remained at one specific subject for more time than he should have. We get to know Bod on his way through life as he finds a new family in the graveyard, experiences friendships and enmities, as he is taught supernatural abilities by the ghosts and learns about major significances between death and life. In the end, this book not only keeps its reader on the edge of the seat, it also explores a meta level by dealing with some more significant topics like losing beloved people and learning to care for others. The writing was not as beautiful as I remembered it from The Ocean at the End of the Lane (which I can forgive because while that book was very well-written, the plot lacked just about everything for me - and an author's writing style should change and improve over the time, just like every person grows with his or her experiences). In addition, the book was not without flaws, but those were not significant enough to embody a major influence in my enjoyment of the novel. ...more \u0388\u03bd\u03b1

I'm probably not the only person that would like to know the next chapter in Bod's life. Even Neil Gaiman may not know, but then again, maybe he does. But that's the nature of books, they end, and many times we are not satisfied, not completely. What a wonderful story, what imagination Gaiman has. Five stars and deserving. Children's literature at it's finest. I remember reading The Jungle Book in translation while in the fourth grade, and being spellbound by Kipling's gifts as a storyteller. I remember reading the original in English as a young man and still feeling the magic afresh. I had not expected it to happen a third time... but it did. Thanks to Neil Gaiman.

I remember reading the original in English as a young man and still feeling the magic afresh. I had not expected it to happen a third time... but it did. Thanks to Neil Gaiman. The Graveyard Book is a thinly disguised parody of, and a tribute to, The Jungle Book . Only, the Indian Jungle here has been translated to an English graveyard; Sher Khan has been transformed into the man Jack; the wolf pack, into a bunch of ghosts; and Bhaloo and Bagheera into Silas the vampire and Miss Lupescu the werewolf. Even the bandar-log are present as the eerily comic ghouls. Mowgli's counterpart is Nobody Owens, affectionately known as Bod, who grows up in the graveyard the same way Mowgli grows up in the jungle: a human boy living like a ghost, existing in the twilight land between death and life. However, this book is much more than a take-off on Kipling's masterpiece. Inspired by the timeless classic, Gaiman has created a masterpiece of his own: a book which can be enjoyed by old and young readers alike. It is genuinely creepy in many places without losing the basic sunny nature of the story. The author's knowledge of Celtic folklore is evident throughout (I was similarly impressed by his almost encyclopaedic grasp of mythology in American Gods ). The novel exudes an old-world charm of the English countryside. But mind you, for all its lightheartedness, the main story is dead serious: literally a matter of life and death for its young protagonist. This is a fun read.

I've read 2 novels and 1 graphic novel of his that I didn't enjoy, so I said this Commemorative Edition might finally be the one to impress me, and I was not disappointed with my decision. When Nobody Owens was an infant, he was left in the graveyard to be raised and protected by ghosts. He was prohibited to leave the graveyard because the guardians feared for his safety. He had no knowledge of the outside world, none aside from the ones told by the ghosts. He was living a happy life in there, and we see him develop from a boy to a young man. A lot of strange things happened in his life. Adventure filled and full of life lessons, for the kids at least. After reading this the first thing that came to my mind would be that this is a coming-of-age novel. Gaiman wrote about an boy's life from infancy to teenage hood. From kid mistakes to possibly falling in love. I didn't even think that I would ever relate to Bod, but unfortunately I liked the kid. I really liked his life adventures even though they sounded so unbelievable. Quite unlikely to happen to anyone, but this is a novel for a reason. 4/5 stars. I'm still not entirely impressed with Gaiman, because this is the only novel of his that I really enjoyed. I'm looking forward to reading Neverwhere and Good Omens, but I'm not really expecting much. For die-hard Gaiman fans, this is the novel for you, and for newbies, this is also for you. What a remarkable novel. It was an easy short read and the artwork was fantastic. I really liked all of the sketches. Go ahead and give this one a try. ...more Emotivna pri\u010da o odrastanju jednog de\u010daka....i o nekim tamo gulovima, i o jednoj ve\u0161tici, i o duhovima, i naravno o groblju.

The reader gets to see Bod go from being a toddler to a young adult, having adventures and making friends (and enemies) along the way. I have to confess that I squeezed back a few man tears at the end. Highly recommended but with the caveat that it's a young adult book. Not that that stops it from being a great story. ...more When a family is murdered by a mysterious killer, one of the intended victims is missing, a young, diapered boy, who had wandered off just before the crime took place. But the killer needed to complete the job. Fortunately for the boy, he was taken in by the late residents of a nearby graveyard.

But the killer needed to complete the job. Fortunately for the boy, he was taken in by the late residents of a nearby graveyard.

He is given to the care of the Owens couple and named \u201cNobody,\u201d Bod for short, as he looks like \u201cnobody but himself.\u201d In this Newbery Medal, Carnegie Medal and Hugo Award winning novel, it takes a graveyard to raise an actual corporate being, and there are many who chip in. Perhaps most important is Silas, resident of the worlds of the dead and the living. As Bod grows there are many interesting sorts who cross his path, a young witch lacking a gravestone, an unscrupulous dealer in antiques, a snake-like protector of a long-dead master, and an array of teachers. And there must, of course, be a girl, Scarlett by name, a living girl. Bod does venture out into the unprotected world beyond the graveyard gates, not always with permission. He wants to go to school like other kids, and does, with mixed results. He wants to buy a headstone for a friend who lacks one. He wants to spend time with Scarlett. As he enters his teen years, he determines to find the person who had killed his family. This is not your usual coming-of-age story. Bod is indeed a likeable kid, good-hearted, innocent, easy to care about. One of Gaiman\u2019s inspirations for this story was Kipling\u2019s The Jungle Book , with Bod as Mowgli and the graveyard residents substituting, sometimes generically, for their animal counterparts in the earlier work. There is a section equivalent to Mowgli having been kidnapped by monkeys, a werewolf might be Akela. Bod\u2019s nemesis is the killer Jack, the Shere-Khan of this tale. Each chapter jumps in time, and we see Bod take on new challenges as he ages. Of course, his home being a graveyard, the challenges he faces are not pedestrian. And finally, he faces an adult, mortal test that will define whether he actually gets to come of age or not. There is so much in The Graveyard Book that is just flat-out charming that you will find, as I did, that your lips keep curling up at the corners. From Bod trying to find properly fitting clothing, to struggling to learn some of the unusual skills the locals have mastered, to coping with some of the lesser baddies who make life difficult for those around them, Bod will gain your allegiance and your affection. The baddie, Jack, is a purely dark sort. No gray areas there. And that makes the central conflict one of pretty much pure good, against completely pure evil. There are plenty of moments of real danger for Bod and that keeps tension high. But there are nuances to other characters that add color and texture to what might otherwise have become a flat gray panel. These additions add heft to the story, and make one wonder larger thoughts about the limits of change, of redemption. This one is easy to recommend, to kids of all ages, but don\u2019t wait too long. You never know when it might be\u2026you know\u2026 too late.

For so long I refused to pick it up because I thought it sounded quaint and possibly twee, but it was neither. It pushed all the buttons that Maggies love to have pushed: archetypes, humor, high stakes, personal stakes, and a deep ingrained sense of folklore that only comes from the author having grown up with rather than researched it. Add to all that and I have to say it was, for me, the most well-written of all of Gaiman's books that I've read. I kept seeing things that I associated as Gaimanisms, but they felt absolutely right here. Weapons wielded by someone for so long that they've become part of their arms. Just ahhh. Loved it.

That thought quickly slipped my mind, so once again, I forgot to add his books on my to-read list. Later that day, I was watching an episode of Doctor Who and while reading the credits, that I don't usually read, I noticed Neil Gaiman's name. It turned out he wrote the episode. I took that as a sign and without further postponement started reading The Graveyard Book (I liked the name and the premise seemed really interesting). I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!! I loved the creepy, yet somehow comical atmosphere, that reminded me of Tim Burton movies. I loved Bod's character, he's such a sweet boy and I loved how he got his name. ( ''He looks like nobody but himself.'' - ''Then Nobody it is.'' ) To cut a long story short, I loved absolutely everything about it and I'm kind of sorry it hasn't been written when I was a kid, I would have probably loved it even more back then, if that's possible. It's just one of those books that make you want to read every single book its writer has ever written and I plan on doing so. ...more This review is hard to write.

Not because I can't think of enough wonderful things to say about this book, but because there are so many things I loved about it. I am very glad that I had the experience of listening to this book on audio. Hearing Mr. Gaiman read it is icing on the scrumptious cake. He has a beautifully expressive, soothing, and emotive voice. He wrote it, so he has the advantage of knowing exactly what emphasis to put on the different lines and passages, and how he wants the various parts read. I had never read Neil Gaiman before this year, and it has been my pleasure to discover him. He is a wonderful fantasist, blessed with the understanding of the joy and the awe that fantasy inspires in a reader. In this case, he manages to take a very dark subject, death, and give it a sense of whimsy and beauty. The idea of an orphan growing up in a graveyard seems morbid, however this book doesn't read that way at all (except perhaps the parts with the ghouls, but that was on purpose). Instead of reading about a lonely, abandoned child stuck in a place of death, I felt the warm, loving way the graveyard and its denizens adopted the orphaned toddler, raising him into a lovely young man. I felt as though I grew to know all the folks in the graveyard, as if they were members of a large, eccentric family. I loved how Mr. Gaiman would introduce a new ghost by what his/her tombstone said. It was just the right touch. This and the abundant personality of the ghosts helped me to avoid descending into sadness at the realization that these were all departed folks lingering on the mortal plane. It felt natural to me. That takes talent. Similarly the whole idea of a murderer looking for an innocent child to finish what he'd started so many years ago could have been excessively dark. It was dark, but the darkness doesn't overwhelm this story, not knowing that the Bod is far from alone in the world. He has a strong wall of protection around him, in the forms of his ghostly family, his guardian Silas, his sometimes babysitter Ms. Lupesco, and the graveyard itself. And Bod grows into a young boy/man with quite a good head on his shoulders, a good heart, and one who is resourceful enough to deal with his very evil pursuer(s), and to learn from his missteps in the complicated world of the living. I truly love this book. The mood, the story, the writing, and the narrator. It will definitely go on my favorites shelf. I think I shall have to get me a paper copy, because this is definitely one for a reread. Highly recommended! ...more 3.5 stars This was a great book to read with Halloween right around the corner!

I will not reveal the details, even though this is the very start of the book, and if you read the blurb it will tell yo \"There was a hand in the darkness, and it held a knife.

And what follows is a thrilling, nerve-jangling episode from the master story teller Neil Gaiman. His imagination knows no bounds. I will not reveal the details, even though this is the very start of the book, and if you read the blurb it will tell you. Suffice it to say, it is very gruesome, \u201cThe knife had done almost everything it was brought to that house to do, and both the blade and the handle were wet.\u201d But don't be misled. Oddly, the beginning is deceptive, and this grisly opening is not in keeping with the rest of the book's light tone. The Graveyard Book is a quirky tale, simply told, and aimed towards the young. At the end of each chapter is an amusing and exaggerated line illustration, very much in keeping with the mood of the book, by the talented Chris Riddell. The novel won the Newbery medal in 2009. Critics have enthused about it, and the fantasy author Diana Wynne Jones called it, \"The best book Neil Gaiman has ever written\" . Just eight chapters long The Graveyard Book is the tale of a journey; a sort of allegorical tale. In another way it can be seen as a bildungsroman, although not in any conventional sense. Neil Gaiman is nothing if not bizarre. The story tells of a baby, who lives and grow to maturity in a graveyard, watched over and cared for by \"Others\". Each chapter takes place after a two year gap. It feels very episodic, and is really a series of linked short stories, some of which are quite creepy and spooky, but each with a warm heart. There is a running theme, but it is not until nearing the end that it becomes clear. The chapters are really quite uneven and irregular in length. However, the narrative style is very engaging. Neil Gaiman's style is unique and instantly recognisable. One critic has referred to his \"magical, haunting prose\" in this novel. Take this, \u201cThe fallen autumn leaves were slick beneath Bod's feet, and the mists blurred the edges of the world. Nothing was as clean-cut as he had thought it, a few minutes before.\u201d Or these, \"Able to slip from shadow to shadow, never seen, never suspected. Free as air, fast as thought, cold as frost, hard as nails, dangerous as ...\" \u201cOne grave in every graveyard belongs to the ghouls. Wander any graveyard long enough and you will find it - water stained and bulging, with cracked or broken stone, scraggly grass or rank weeds about it, and a feeling, when you reach it, of abandonment. It may be colder than the other gravestones, too, and the name on the stone is all too often impossible to read. If there is a statue on the grave it will be headless or so scabbed with fungus and lichens as to look like fungus itself. If one grave in a graveyard looks like a target for petty vandals, that is the ghoul-gate. If the grave wants to make you be somewhere else, that is the ghoul-gate.\u201d \"The hairs on the back of Bod's neck began to prickle. The voice in his head was something very old and very dry, like the scraping of a dead twig against the window of the chapel.\" The prose is hypnotic, drawing the reader in. We forgive the odd structure, the lack of direction. We want to read more, \"Soon enough you will master Fading and Sliding and Dreamwalking.\" \"The man looked well preserved, but still like something that had been dead for a long while.\" \"Something huge touched him, brushed him from head to feet, and he shivered. His hair prickled, and his skin was all gooseflesh.\" There is both dark fantasy here, and also recognisable traditional motifs, \"THE SLEER GUARDS THE TREASURES, THE BROOCH, THE GOBLET, THE KNIFE. WE GUARD THEM FOR THE MASTER\" and very familiar scarey monsters of imagined worlds, from every culture, and from time immemorial. The Graveyard Book took its author over 20 years to write. Yet this in itself seems puzzling; it is such a slight, readable work. It has enchanting imagery - but no great depth, or profound message. Neil Gaiman has explained how this random collection of ideas formed. He watched his little boy, as a 2 year-old, riding his tricycle between some gravestones one summer, and his imagination stirred. The author then first wrote the story of \"The Witch's Headstone\" starting, \"There was a witch buried at the edge of the graveyard ...\" . This forms chapter 4 of the final novel. Also everpresent in the back of Neil Gaiman's mind was one of his favourite books as a child, one which \"excited and impressed\" him so much that he read and reread it over and over again. It was Rudyard Kipling's two volumes of stories which make up \"The Jungle Book\" . The Graveyard Book 's theme reinterprets Rudyard Kipling's vision; it is a written homage to a master. Sometimes the references are overt, \"It was a jungle here, of fallen headstones and headless statues, of trees and holly bushes, of slippery piles of half-rotted fallen leaves but it was a jungle that Bod had explored since he had been old enough to walk and to wander.\" As the years passed Neil Gaiman's imagination continued to conjure up the weird and the wonderful. He told half-formed parts of the story to his children, who pestered him to tell them what happened next. Neil Gaiman jotted down more ideas, in diverse places such as Florida, Cornwall and New Orleans. His friend Audrey Niffeneger showed him around \"the ivy-covered marvel that is Highgate Cemetery West\" . (I can attest to this description. An image and memory of that particular wonderful cemetery was in my mind the entire time I read the book, although I had not known of the connection.) He admired a song called \"Graveyard\" by another friend, Tori Amos, \"I said She's gone but I'm alive, I'm alive I'm coming in the graveyard to sing you to sleep now.\" Gradually the story began to take shape. It is a story of \"Others\", vampires and werewolves, guardians and ghouls. But none are depicted as you will have seen them before. There are elements of fantasy and humour; there are murders and menace, and there is desperate human longing. There are characters with peculiar names: Silas, Nobody Owens, Miss Lupescu, Mr Pennyworth, the \"Jacks of All Trades\" and the Sleer. There is folklore and rhyme. There is talk of, \"the Macabray, the dance of the living and the dead, the dance with Death.\" \u201cRich man, poor man, come away. Come to dance the Macabray.\u201d \u201cRattle his bones over the stones its only a pauper who nobody owns\u201d and there is simple homespun philosophic wisdom, \"People want to forget the impossible. It makes their world safer.\" \"Fear is contagious. You can catch it. Sometimes all it takes is for someone to say that they're scared for the fear to become real.\" \"You're always you and that don't change and you're always changing, and there's nothing you can do about it.\" \"Wherever you go you take yourself with you.\" \u201cIt is neither fair nor unfair, Nobody Owens. It simply is.\u201d The protagonist \"Bod\" learns encouragement. He learns about life, and he also learns about death, \"It's always easier to die gently, to wake in due time in the place you were buried.\" \u201cDeath is the great democracy.\u201d \"The graveyard kept it secrets.\" And sometimes the author's hand just brushes across humour, \u201cName the different kinds of people,\u201d said Miss Lupescu. \u201cNow.\u201d Bod thought for a moment. \u201cThe living,\u201d he said. \u201cEr. The dead.\u201d He stopped. Then, \u201c... Cats?\u201d he offered, uncertainly.\u201d So, what do we have here? A cosy chatty dark fantasy novel? A soft-centred story about ghouls? You got it! I'm not telling you the story. Go read the book. \"You're alive, Bod. That means you have infinite potential. You can do anything, make anything, dream anything. If you change the world, the world will change. Potential. Once you're dead, it's gone. Over. You've made what you've made, dreamed your dream, written your name ... But that potential is finished.\" \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re going to do now?\u201d she asked. \u201cSee the world,\u201d said Bod. \u201cGet into trouble. Get out of trouble again.

The Graveyard Book is the kind of novel that I can\u2019t imagine anyone hating or even actively disliking. It is, in many ways, the perfect children\u2019s book. Although it deals with some darker topics such as death and loss, it still remains a fun and relatively light-hearted read. A book you could easily give to your children but can still very much be enjoyed by adults. And indeed, I enjoyed The Graveyard Book . It was unique and whimsical, filled with quirky characters and Gaiman\u2019s beautiful writing style. A short read that is both occasionally funny and moving. The novel is set in a graveyard and yet Neil Gaiman somehow manages to make the setting vibrant and full of life, not morbid at all. You're alive, Bod. That means you have infinite potential. You can do anything, make anything, dream anything. If you can change the world, the world will change. Potential. Once you're dead, it's gone. Over. You've made what you've made, dreamed your dream, written your name. You may be buried here, you may even walk. But that potential is finished. Despite all these clear positives, I felt like something was missing. I wanted something more from the story, from the characters. I liked Bod, he was a lovable little kid, however, I didn\u2019t feel anything more for him. I couldn\u2019t relate or empathize with him and I didn\u2019t find him to be particularly interesting. I actually felt the same about the other characters: Likable certainly, but I just lacked a certain engagement. I had the exact same issue with the plot. Relatively original, quite intriguing at times but it lacked suspense. I was never at the edge of my seat, never worried about the characters; there wasn\u2019t anything that really pulled me along and made me want to pick up the book. Without a doubt, Neil Gaiman is a very gifted storyteller. His prose is phenomenal and the way he writes makes the story appropriate for a younger audience without ever being dumbed down. Gaiman never sacrifices meaning and themes. If you are a fan Gaiman\u2019s works then I recommend you pick this one up. If you haven\u2019t yet read a Neil Gaiman book then this one might be a good place to start. As for me, the prose alone compels me to pick up his books in the future. ...more", "Title": "The Graveyard Book"},
