I am giving up around the halfway point - which is arguably very generous for a 600-page book - because I'm just getting more and more irritated. I picked up <+++>I Am Pilgrim</+++> after seeing it on Goodreads' 16 Underrated Books That Deserve Your Attention post, and thinking that it was about time I found myself a fast-paced thriller. And it starts fairly well, I'll give it that. The novel is broken up into \"parts\", each dealing with a different part of Pilgrim's life - as an Intelligence agent,<---M> an assassin</---M>, a criminal investigator, etc. - and the first part is quite exciting. It opens with a grisly murder, seemingly sexual in nature, with the victim dissolving in acid in the bathtub. The scene is so lacking in evidence that it looks like we got a badass on our hands. Come on... murder, sex, perfect crimes - who wouldn't be interested at this point? The bestest, baddest super spy of them all - the so-called \"Pilgrim\" - seems a little generic and lacking in characterization beyond the repeated affirmations by everyone that he really is THE BEST at everything, but that's okay. This book has over six hundred pages; surely he will develop a personality in time. He doesn't . The few times the author attempts to connect us with his protagonist are over the most obvious universal sentiments - by that I mean he is sad for the people who were tortured and starved during the Holocaust, and angry because of 9/11. Oh wow, so that makes him like... almost everyone else. Also, it seems strange that his narrative \"voice\" changes significantly in each part, depending on whether he is being sad for the war victims or delivering a diatribe against the crazy Muslims. I felt like I was reading stories told from the perspective of different characters. AND it's all tell, tell, tell. He is the best in the world. This super badass former Intelligence Officer who knows everything\u2026 or so we keep being told. In action, he acts like an idiot for the most part, makes stupid mistakes, is somehow allowed to publish a book about his time as a secret agent (wtf?), and then spends his life running from all the readers who want to hunt him down. Every single woman he meets his beautiful beyond belief, and I lost count of how many times we had to hear descriptions of the various curves, boobs, legs and heels wandering around . I'm not even looking at this as a feminist critique - political issues aside, frankly, it's boring. And yes, I absolutely would feel the same way if someone was constantly describing all the gorgeous men with rippling muscles. Yet, this didn't stop me from reading. Nope, it was something else. These things are, in fact, all minor criticisms compared to the raging Islamophobia . It honestly made me very uncomfortable. I know that authors are not their characters, but I swear I could feel Hayes' disdain for the Saudi culture and people dripping onto the pages. Now, I'll admit it: I don't think Saudi practices should be beyond criticism. I don't agree with their laws limiting women's rights, and the government is guilty of many human rights abuses. BUT Pilgrim's self-righteous superiority as he marches through this Muslim country is embarrassing . Despite its huge wealth, vast oil reserves, and love of high-tech American armaments, nothing really works in Saudi Arabia. The driver thought I was crazy - but then his religion thinks stoning a woman to death for adultery is reasonable, so I figured we were about even. This whole book is about a white American milking 9/11 as an excuse to defeat the crazy Muslims. It perpetuates the notion that Muslims hate America, and that Saudis are lecherous pervs who lust after white women. And, by the way, that last quote there just bugs the hell out of me. I'm a British atheist and I have no religious affiliation, but someone needs to say it: the Christian Bible also thinks adulterers should be put to death! \"If a man commits adultery with another man's wife both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death.\" (Leviticus 20:10) AND, if we're being nitpicky, the Qu'ran doesn't sentence adulterers to death, it sentences them to a flogging. The Hadiths, however, is the text that sentences adulterers to death BUT it does not distinguish between male and female adulterers. When an unmarried male commits adultery with an unmarried female, they should receive one hundred lashes and banishment for one year. And in case of married male committing adultery with a married female, they shall receive one hundred lashes and be stoned to death. \u2014\u2009Sahih Muslim, 17:4191 I read on for another couple hundred pages after the Islamophobia started because I wanted to give the book a chance to redeem itself. But it didn't. The story literally is about an amazing American agent defeating the Muslims. It's cringy.

Just as well, because there's a Middle Eastern terrorist heading to The Promised Land (America, of course) to cause carnage not seen since 9/11. Which, incidentally makes you weep every time you think about it. All those innocent people. Heroes. Unlike all the foreign scum you have killed over the years who deserved all they got because they're not American.

And don't tell me \"well that's the thriller genre\" because no, it's not. There are a ton of well written ones out there. But I've decided to turn this terrible experience into a positive thing for everyone. Instead of telling you all everything wrong with this book, I'm just going to give you a few tips on how to write a better book than this: 1)If you are going to call your book a thriller, don't spend the first 300 pages in pedantic flashbacks to memories of unimportant childhood happenings and wait til the last maybe 150 pages for things to start to get quasi-exciting. 2) For the love-of-god, pick a narrative voice and stick with it. And if you don't, make sure its done well and done for a reason. Oh, and my-main-character-is-too-boring is not a legit reason. 3) Don't introduce every character with a description of their specific anatomical features. Much as I appreciate it when every male character has a scar, when I find myself asking \"oh, I wonder what body part on this fellow is maimed?\" you probably need to try something else. I also don't need to know about the tits, curvy mouths, slim hips, mini skirts, 6-inch heels and gaping blouses that every. female. character has. I terrified my husband by throwing this book at the wall halfway through and screaming \"no more *&^%%$ high cheekbones!\" which apparently is a must for every woman in <---A>Terry Hayes</---A>' fantasy world. 4)If you are going to claim your character is the most bad-ass super spy ever(who also went to Harvard) don't put him in situation after situation in which he shows himself to be the worst intelligence agent in history. Like when he robs a bank for useless records (because in this high-tech age super-spies don't computer?), or goes to the FBI for a contact because he knows fewer (actually he knows none at all?) hackers/tech people in the intelligence community than the FBI director...despite the fact you were station agent in the UK???(How is that possible?) Oh, and please write the obligatory ops, hits, and covert happenings with a little thought. And by that I mean just make them more planned, controlled, discrete and realistic than a preschool class on crank. 5) Make your protagonist a little interesting. Just a little. If you actually have to use the Holocaust, Bosnian genocide, 9/11 and numerous other atrocities by telling us how your protagonist FEELS about them to garner empathy, you're doing it wrong. See-my-character-hates-genocide-just-like-you is pretty much the lowest point of human relatability possible. 6) \"Well golly I need a villain don't I? I don't really have time to be original because I'm writing about cheekbones and stiletto heels, so let's just make him a Muslim who decides he hates 'Merica because his dad died...at the hand of other Muslims. Every body hates Muslims. They are all angry and irrational. And that way I can make sweeping bigoted remarks like 'The driver thought I was crazy--but then his religion thinks stoning a woman to death for adultery is reasonable' and no one will care! Win-'effing-win!\" 7) If you are going to put me through this many pages, please don't introduce characters and story-lines that contribute zero to the story (Bradley). Oh wait, but you do need him because you need a guy that our hero passes super-secret cryptic phone messages (\"Our mutual friend will understand\") to because he can't call his handler (oh yeah ya'll, his handler is the director of intelligence and POTUS. This agent don't play) in the white house directly. 'cept for all those times when he delivers the message to you, and then calls the white house directly anyways. 8) Complex Sentences are highly recommended. \"It was sad, really\" doesn't count. And if I read one. more. book. that uses the words \"the gathering dark\", I will burn down the internet....just stop it! So, basically start there and you should have a book a hundred times better than this one. Save yourself from this \"summer\" reading. ...more WOW!!!

The only problem is..it takes me forever to read the book. There has been a murder in a run down hotel in New York. A woman has been soaked in a tub of acid and her teeth removed. The killer does not want this woman identified. That little tidbit starts the spin that is this book. The main character is the super-spy guy. I'm going to call him Scott, but he has so many different names that I don't think he remembers his own either. Scott has retired from the business. He just wants some peace and quiet after giving all he has to his country. You know that ain't gonna happen though. There is a major terrorist out there that is about to start his dreams of taking down the infidels of the west (America). He doesn't plan on stopping there though. He wants to wipe out as many people globally as he can. Enter Scott's old bosses, those types of guys that never give you much information, because it's classified. This guy is what Jason Bourne would have been if he wasn't played by this puss head. Times a hundred. \\Mostly I was thinking about how the secret world never leaves you-it's always waiting in the darkness, ready to gather its children back again. I don't want to give too much of the book away. I will say that this story line terrified me. Completely and utterly. I could see this happening and I hope to all that is Tom Cruise that some nut job doesn't decide to make it come true. BE PEACEFUL MOTHERFUCKERS!! This was also a debut for this author. I never would have guessed that. There were a few bad things. (This would have gotten a full five star otherwise) The book does drag at times, but if I put it down I could feel it calling to me, I couldn't take not knowing what was going on when I wasn't reading. There is a TON of info. I feel like I know this character inside and out. I added him to my Christmas card list. We cousins now. There is a few boo-boo's with the medical stuff. There are two instances that I had to stop and say..\"you got that shit wrong\"..but there is enough right that I didn't hold it against him. Some readers are going to say that it's bent towards America winning. I'm American..so I'm okay with that. I hear that a movie is in the works for this big old sucker.

I prefer my surprises and plot twists to be unadulterated by book jacket blurbs and blabby reviewers. Here's the all-you-need-to-know version of the plot: The man who calls himself Pilgrim has a long history in secret operations. He is pressed into service to apprehend a Saudi Arabian dude who has manufactured a \u201chomemade apocalypse\u201d. All by his little old self he made it. No secret terrorist cells or Al-Qaeda. Just one way too brilliant guy who has been planning for many years to destroy America.. There's a whole lot of other stuff going on, including an investigation of a murder in NYC, but it's all incorporated into the main story arc. Sounds simple, right? Nope. Not simple at all, and that's why I loved it so and wanted to give it six stars. Complexity. Depth of back story for the primary characters. Lots of globe trotting, with just the right amount of detail about each location to make it feel real without sounding like a tourist guide. And what else? It's scary as hell, because this kind of thing could happen. Right now. Tomorrow. Next year. The tragedies of September 11, 2001 would almost seem small compared to what's possible. (Small in the sense of number of lives lost, not small for those who lost loved ones.) And here's what else is exceptional about this novel. Terry Hayes is a veteran of the movie business, so he knows a thing or two about pacing, suspense, and setting up exciting bang-bang-shoot-em-up scenes and car chases. There's a great scene in a boat house in Turkey that could be shot on film as is and blow your socks off. Enough of my raving. Just go read the book. My review copy was 606 pages, and I read it in about a week. That was hard on my dry eyes, but I couldn't resist the pull. Is it perfect? No. But I'm not going to tell you what I perceived to be the flaws. I don't want them to jump out at you just because I mentioned them. It's one hell of a ride, and that's all that matters.

There's no denying that the author has clearly done a lot of research and he has an economical way with words that allows his often fragmented narrative to remain essentially readable. But there is still a lack of realism, shoddy plotting and a nasty veneer of racism, xenophobia and right-wing triumphalism that is barely hidden throughout. For all the intricate plotting the story too often depends on some pretty unbelievable coincidences, all of it a result of trying to lever far too much in. There is simply no need to try to mesh a New York murder mystery with an international terrorist plot (not to mention a revenge vendetta). It all ends up contrived and silly and Hayes would have been better saving one plot for a sequel. It's not even clear what kind of book the author is trying to write. Is it a serial-killer detective thriller, or a CIA confessional, or a middle-eastern polemic, or a James Bond exotic caper, or a race-against-time globe-trotting adventure? It tries to be all of these things and simply ends up confusing itself. As for our hero, a super-spy come existentialist loner, he's equally bemusing and unbelievable throughout: his backstory maudlin, his pompously self-styled expertise unconvincing, his effortless retirement unlikely and his actions irrational. He's like a cypher squeezed into whichever literary genre Hayes is cheerfully butchering at any given time. However it's the tone and undercurrent of this book that are particularly repellent. The neocon posturing is endless as the author tut-tuts at every hackneyed liberal position from freedom of information to European Union immigration policy. One can only wonder at the kind of functional world he actually wants. All foreigners are reduced to one-dimensional stereotypes: corrupt officials, leering gigolos, psychotic jihadists, incompetent policemen, unscrupulous bankers, crass nouveau-riche. We even have a comic-relief Turkish hotel manager who seems to have wandered in from an old episode of the Benny Hill Show. All of them are irredeemably sleazy, particularly in contrast to our ever-principled American heroes, and all of them, bizarrely, appear fluent in American-style English, to avoid the author the trouble of translation or language barriers. Even the Saracen, for all the commendable detail put into his story, never amounts to much more than a typical fundamentalist nutjob, and his Achilles Heel at the end is totally unconvincing and negates 600 pages of careful development. If you are a conservative American you'll probably love this. If not, beware. It's like Jack Ryan with Fox News editorials. ...more \"Who is this guy, Terry Hayes?\", I asked myself when I was 200 pages in to the 600+ page I Am Pilgrim I was so hooked I had to read a bio of the author and you might want to also.

I think this debut is going to be a word of mouth huge best seller this summer. I Am Pilgrim has got it all. It starts off with an expertly described ghastly murder scene of a young woman found dead in a bath of acid in a dingy hotel called The Eastside Inn. I couldn't believe where this beginning took me. Hayes has managed to weave a plot that includes the beheading of a man in a Saudi Arabian public square, an adopted child who becomes an agent in an organization that doesn't exist, a NY city hero cop, a boy with Downs Syndrome, the death of a wealthy playboy, religion, love, honor, and a terrorist plot that will eradicate millions in the US and that's only the half of it. He pulls this off in a hair raising adventure all over the Mideast and back which at times pushes the limits but doesn't spoil the ride. Just thank heavens someone's on our side. Be warned some of the scenes of murder and torture are gruesome. I found myself cringing at the least and skipping over some the worst. I Am Pilgrim is one of the best spy thrillers I've read in some time. Scary for certain, plausible, I'd love to have a scientist chime in. The Film rights are still up in the air but I can see it.

That was forty years ago! \u201cDespite all her years of relentless sex, [the phone call] was to the only real man in her life \u2013 her father.\u201d The worst problem - among many - is that the author keeps telling us how amazing his main character is, without ever really showing us. He\u2019s the world\u2019s best killer, detective, forensic scientist\u2026 one supporting character says of him: \u201dThere was one thing: he was clever \u2013 I mean, outstandingly clever \u2013 at what he did. I remember wondering if all FBI agents were that good.\u201d But the central mystery of the book is solved through absolute coincidence. By pure chance he\u2019s working on two unrelated cases which happen to coincide. All through the book he gets lucky breaks, make guesses with no logic behind them but always turn out right\u2026 really, the one bit of actual detective work he does involves a bit of science that\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. The main character just seems like a bit of an unlikeable dick. He\u2019s super-rich, arrogant, has an unpleasant streak of misogyny running through him, and apparently has a voracious appetite for drugs (which again, we\u2019re only told about, never shown). He\u2019s even, apparently, an expert on playing bass. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re a good bass player,\u2019 I told him, \u2018maybe one of the best I\u2019ve heard \u2013 and I know what I\u2019m talking about\u2019\u201d This, along with his self-decribed \u2018dark streak\u2019 makes him seem like a super-agent dreamed up by a 17-year-old boy. The one thing you can say about the book is that it keeps the pages turning, but that\u2019s all done through the James Patterson Technique - short chapters, with a cliffhanger in almost every one. It also uses the cheap trick of hiding information from the reader although we\u2019re supposed to be present with the narrator at all times. \u201cI opened the plastic bag, took out the device I had purchased and headed towards them.\u201d - What device? Why didn\u2019t you tell us when you bought it? The narration is often confused, talking in the third person then suddenly breaking into first, as you realise that it\u2019s the narrator somehow telling us the private thoughts of other characters. If you\u2019ve read this far, you can probably guess that I can\u2019t recommend this book at all. A grand waste of my time. ...more In some ways this may end up being a fairly simplistic review in comparison to others I have read about this wonderful novel.

For me, as a book lover, blogger and a person who just wants to send your way the very best stories I find out there, this says more than any in depth critique of \u201cI am Pilgrim\u201d could achieve. I do have more to say of course \u2013 but that is the long and the short of it fellow readers. Firstly, what struck me when I received my copy was the sheer size of the book. That excited me \u2013 nowadays its rare to find a book that can hold your attention over so many pages \u2013 authors don\u2019t tend to write them. Now of course, there is nothing wrong with a book of any size as long as you ENJOY it but I have always been a lover of stories that perhaps give you that little bit more. Its difficult to achieve but Terry Hayes has done so. There is a reason why \u201cThe Stand\u201d by Stephen King is still my number 1 book of all time \u2013 it, like Pilgrim, is an absorbing, exciting, heart stopping tale with heart that doesnt end in a flash but gives you greater insight and a longer period of time over which to enjoy it. If you, like me, appreciate that sort of thing then this book is definitely for you. Following \u201cPilgrim\u201d on his journey was without doubt one of my favourite reading experiences ever. The sheer scale of the story will astound you \u2013 as you learn about his background, the things he achieved or perhaps didnt, you will be enthralled and totally caught up in the moment. I have seen reviewers say that it was obviously written with an eye to a blockbuster movie \u2013 well I can see their point, especially given the author\u2019s background \u2013 but actually I disagree. Its all about the story\u2026.written in a way that will keep you READING \u2013 it wasnt until I was done with it that I cast it in my head (yes, yes I do that with everything!) during the actual time spent within its pages, a movie was the last thing on my mind. Starting off as a murder mystery it turns into something else altogether \u2013 a chase across continents to stop an atrocity and to catch an evil man. Part crime mystery, mostly enthralling spy thriller with an opponent the like of which you may think y0u\u2019ve seen before but havent \u2013 its heart stoppingly good. Not since Nelson De Mille\u2019s \u201cThe Lion\u201d who appeared in some of the John Corey books will you find a \u201cterrorist\u201d as intriguing as this one. And just as intriguing is the man trying to catch him\u2026a man I still don\u2019t truly know. Its clever. Its exciting. It is never dull and always unexpected. It has more than one story \u2013 you will get an awful lot for your money here. Apart from that I say nothing. If you want an in depth plot analysis you will need to look elsewhere \u2013 it won\u2019t be hard, this book has touched many \u2013 I will end by saying that this is a must read for anyone who simply loves books. And reading. And finding those stories that will always stay with you and you will read again. Will it knock any of my \u201ctop ten reads of all time\u201d down a space on my list?

Spending his entire career employed by a secret division of the US government, Pilgrim rode off into the sunset by putting a lifetime of knowledge into what would become the definitive text on forensic crime scene investigation. But what happens when someone uses Pilgrim\u2019s book as a manual for committing the perfect crime? I received a free copy from Simon & Schuster in exchange for an honest review. The scope of Terry Hayes\u2019 I Am Pilgrim is much larger than I initially expected. This tightly constructed, well researched thriller takes us around the world and into the lives of two very driven men on opposite sides of the spectrum. What begins as a squeaky clean murder scene expands into a global manhunt with the fate of the Western world hanging in the balance. When I first heard the synopsis, I instantly associated it with a Jack Bauer adventure. I expected a macho superspy loaded up with overflowing bravado with a penchant for kicking terrorist ass. Luckily for us, the author is ambitious enough to take a 600 page novel and really give it some backbone. The character development is top-notch and when both adversaries finally do meet, the groundwork has been laid perfectly to support such a high stakes battle. Without giving anything away, make sure you keep an eye on your pulse as the novel draws to a close. Despite all the work and all the room Hayes allotted himself to draw out the conclusion given the page count, he leaves it for the last thirty pages or so. That means that the storytelling is flying with white knuckle speed as Pilgrim tries to stop a global apocalypse. Great stuff. Supposedly this is the first in a series and while I\u2019m up for revisiting the character, I would have been fine with this existing as a stand-alone novel \u2013 it\u2019s that strong. If you\u2019re a fan of blockbuster movies, this is one of those rare instances when a book can perfectly capture that feeling. Read with popcorn.

The book has real POV oddities -- sometimes we're in the main character's head, and sometimes we are in 3rd person omniscient. Further blurring that is Hayes' tendency to have Pilgrim speculate as to the thoughts and feelings of others -- generally as they are dying, which seems presumptuous and weird. Pilgram speaks with a great deal of authority about everything, and it's not always clear if his opinions are the author's as well, which makes me uneasy when he casts broad generalizations about the middle east. I made it through half of the book before I gave up and decided I had better things to do with my life. I think what really tipped it for me was just how incredibly flat any female character was. The only positive female characters are barely mentioned assassins, loyal wives, or stock women created for the purpose of highlighting Islamic culture's sexism. Other than that, any women are *constantly* putting their \"best assets\" (Hayes's words) on display for Pilgram's benefit. That's how ladies get it done, I guess. Anyway, if you'd like a book that plays on American political fears and adds in some light sexism and racism, this is the book for you. ...more \u2018The chemical flood hit his limbs \u2013 he realized with a wild rage that nothing could stop it now \u2013 and he saw his car keys fall from the jelly that used to be his hands.\u2019 I looked forward to this book for months and finished it in about four days which, when you consider it is nearly 800 pages long, says something about its pace.

At the end of all that, I\u2019m really not sure how to begin to review it. Given everything I\u2019d been led to expect, this much-hyped book started, for me, rather surprisingly quietly. A baffling murder scene in a run-down New York hostel brings together our hero, Pilgrim, and the NYPD copper, Ben Bradley, who eventually becomes Pilgrim\u2019s side-kick and one of the most likeable characters of the book. It was interesting enough, well-written enough to hold my attention, but not the epic, race against time, most thrilling thriller ever written I\u2019d been hoping for. It gets there \u2013 Oh, my, but it get\u2019s there \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t do it fast. There is a lot of backstory to get through before we can really get to grips with the main point of the book which, essentially, is a dual played out in a race against time, a clash of the Titans with not a moment to spare, a fight to the death between the two single strongest warriors of our age. Pilgrim and Saracen. Pilgrim is a member of the United States 'Department' - a kind of Military police for the CIA - staffed with people so deniable that even the Department's existence is kept secret. Pilgrim has risen through the shadowy ranks until he\u2019s sent out to Turkey to discover all he can about a man who seems to be planning a massive bio-terror attack. It turns out to be the worst bio-terror attack imaginable: engineered smallpox that will devastate the world's population, starting with that of the United States. Saracen is a native of Saudi Arabia who, as a young boy saw his father publicly beheaded by the Saudi government. He and his family are forced to flee their home, he sees his beloved mother becoming increasingly westernized (corrupt) and eventually grows up to become one of the most trusted warriors of the Mujahedeen. The plot to annihilate America is his alone and he carries it out with a ruthless, terrifying brilliance. This book probably isn\u2019t for everyone. Its length will put off some, as might the considerable amount of back story that needs to be absorbed in order to fully understand our two main characters. It has been described as both bigoted and racist, charges I wouldn\u2019t accept, but I can understand why some people might be offended. On the other hand, it\u2019s clever, brave, ambitious, fast-paced (towards the end I had to keep putting it down, I was genuinely afraid I might hyper-ventilate) original, brutal (one scene in particular I had to skip) and quite possibly the best thriller I\u2019ve ever read. ...more I am abandoning this book at a 100 pages.

Until it isn't that: the goody bag at Harrogate last weekend contained a small 'taster' booklet that offered the first chapter of I Am Pilgrim by Terry Hayes. I read it late on Saturday night, bought the book on Sunday and started reading it on Monday. I finished it late last night and it's been a fantastic week's read: a big, solid, chunky, fast-paced, rip-roaring thriller, the love child of a manic union between Jack Reacher and James Bond. The pace and international flavour shouldn't be a surprise: from the start, this reads like the book of the film and that film will be a blockbuster. This is a debut novel, and (sorry, this is a cliche, but it's true) an astonishing feat that makes sense when we know that the author has been a journalist for the Sydney Morning Herald, covered the Watergate scandal and went on to be a screenwriter on such luminaries as Mad Max 2, Payback and Bangkok Hilton. So when we have Bondian 'hero escapes from insuperable odds' scenes set in giant warehouses with ships on gantries being sent hither and thither and our hero hanging by one arm, desperately trying not to be recognised by the Turkish police... it's easy to imagine it on a big screen with all the action and adrenaline and testosterone. But the book isn't only high adrenaline action and guns named by make and model number: the premise is clever. The narrator, whom we know primarily as Scott Murdoch - although we know that wasn't his birth name - is a member of the US's 'Department' - the spies who spy on spies - a kind of Military police for the CIA - staffed with people so deniable that even the department's existence is held secret. Pilgrim (as he becomes) starts off well by executing the corrupt leader in broad daylight in Moscow's Red Square and his life goes downhill from there until the point where he's asked to be the lone 'Pathfinder' sent out to Turkey to discover all he can about a man who seems to be planning a massive bio-terror attack. Actually, it's *the* worst bio-terror attack you could imagine: engineered smallpox which will rip through the world's population and reduced it to a fraction of what it was at the start. Woven through the spy-hunting-terrorist plot is a secondary spy-helping-NYPD plot which follows the investigation of a murder in a grimy New York hotel. What makes it different was that both the victim and - so our hero thinks - the perpetrator were women. So we have a possible lesbian subplot which is always entertaining and certainly becomes so here. The two plots inevitably collide in a small Turkish town, but not before we've been to Paris, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Bulgaria and seen side plots in London and Thailand. It's a vast, intricate, wonder of a book, full of clever use of technology and - I'm sure - a lot of research into how smallpox might rationally be spread. It also sounds a loud and clear warning: if the US government's planning is as woefully inadequate as the books suggests, then our civilisation's days are numbered. I'm sure this will be a stellar hit, but get it early and be one of the pathfinders: It's a fantastic, fun, high-adrenaline read for the summer: just the thing to fill days on the beach or evenings at home. ...more I AM PILGRIM is being touted as a stunning thriller in a class of its own, and so I admit I was sucked in. I am happy to say (after 700 pages?!?) that the book is, indeed, better than your run of the mill thriller both in terms of the plot itself as well as Hayes' writing style.

It is written in first person which I found really effective in making you connect to the protagonist a.k.a. Pilgrim/Scott/Jude or one of the other names he used. I often find my problem with thrillers to be that I cannot connect to the main character at all, not just because they are usually male and superhuman, but also because they are written in third person. Hayes immediately achieves a sense of intimacy between the reader and the character by allowing us to know his most private thoughts and letting us know him better than anyone else. On the outside, he remains highly enigmatic to everyone he meets, so you feel, reading it, as though you are really living the story through him, which, I think, is the mark of a good writer. I will say that the plot was, at times, a little confusing and I actually had to go back to re-read or check something I had missed earlier. That said, it does wrap up nicely, and I enjoyed the way Hayes used memory and flashbacks to slowly unfold the story. Despite this and its length, the book moves quickly and I was never bored. I look forward to the next installment in what promises to be an engaging series. ...more I Am Pilgrim is without a doubt an extraordinary take on the contemporary thriller and running to 700 pages a remarkable interweaving of the lives of two men defined by the experiences of their formative years drawing them into a headlong collision in the defence of their personal affiliations.

Opening with a baffling crime scene in New York, the plot expands into a race against time to thwart a devastating terrorist plot by a man known as Saracen, scarred as a boy by the execution of his father in Saudi Arabia who seeks to wreak revenge on the rulers of his native country by attacking its most stalwart of supporters- the United States of America. Pilgrim is the codename of the man dispatched to track and nullify Saracen, himself a man with a convoluted past comprising many identities whose pursuit of Saracen takes him on a terrifying journey across the world to stop this potential act of terrorism which could lead to mass murder\u2026 Reflecting the author\u2019s background as a screenwriter of many influential action films, the book relies heavily on the visual quality of the locations chosen, and the undying credo of the United States as the harbinger of justice and power in the fight against terrorism, so the ending is never really in doubt but it\u2019s a hell of a journey on the way. As the book pivots between the personal stories of Pilgrim and Saracen, so begins a convoluted and at times totally engaging story of cat and mouse, as both men strive to fulfil their roles and we become immersed in to how they have become the men they are. As Saracen\u2019s mission becomes clear and we learn more of the background of his pursuer Pilgrim, the depth and scope of Hayes characterisation of both is probably the strongest aspect of this book. As both men embark on differing pilgrimages in their lives, there is a clever blurring of their personal demarcation as being \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 as Pilgrim and Saracen exhibit the qualities of both, and my empathies as a reader were waxing and waning between the two. Despite the painting of Saracen as a \u2018baddie\u2019, I actually found the unfolding of his personal history the most gripping of the two, but unfortunately towards the middle of the book, there is an imbalance and the weight of the story with the emphasis and drive of the narrative falls more on Pilgrim, with to my mind anyway, an opportunity to maybe have done a little more tightening up in terms of plotting. I actually found myself getting a little bored as events unfolded in Turkey in these middle sections, and wanted to get pulled back to Saracen\u2019s skulduggery sooner. Likewise, the careful build-up to the final denouement is largely undone by the sheer incredulity of the ending, which oozed the potential incarnation of the book as Hollywood action film, and all the cliches thereof and to me bore little resemblance of how this should have played out. With this book\u2019s evident position as a new take on the somewhat stale espionage thriller genre, I felt Hayes could have been a little braver in light of what had preceded this, and really shaken the reader up instead of relying on a truly stereotypical outcome. In the light of the sheer brilliance of some of the plot threads, the obvious depth of research he has implemented and the strength of the characterisation of both the two main characters and Pilgrim\u2019s cohort, NYPD detective Ben Bradley whose personal story and his comeback from the depths of despair is deeply affecting within the main plot, I was disappointed that this fell at the final hurdle. Judging by the enthusiasm for this book by other reviewers, there is no doubt that I Am Pilgrim is a unique, clever and at times enthralling thriller, that is defined by its difference in terms of superlative plotting and characterisation, to other practitioners in this genre. Despite my own observations on some of the weaknesses of this book- much of which could have been resolved by closer editing and a more credible ending- this is definitely worth reading if you enjoy an ambitious and intelligent espionage thriller with plenty of action and a truly international feel. ...more This is possibly the most daft and implausible thriller that I have ever read. While I read it to get to the silliest of endings that I could have predicted many chapters ago the entire thing irritated me.

While I read it to get to the silliest of endings that I could have predicted many chapters ago the entire thing irritated me. The hero \"Pilgrim\" amongst many other names, is a teenagers conception of the ultimate man. Every woman he encounters is stunningly beautiful and every crime is solvable through the tinniest fragment of evidence. But he has no character at all. He is an everyman, he-man, that can kill with his little finger, knows the Directors of the Uffizi restoration programme in Florence and owns the most comprehensive contemporary art collection in the world. He can sail, write, kill and apparently look at 5 numbers and tell that they are a phone number for Bodrum in Turkey. But he has no relationships except with himself (a very vacant relationship), a cop in NY (a very spurious relationship formed through the most ridiculously implausible research by that cop)and with a kid with Downs Syndrome... Hayes's writing is for the most part is OK but descends into the bad every few lines. There is no nuance just a repeated chapter ending that makes us want to turn the page apparently - it is like a cheap comic book. My biggest irritation however was with the inconsistencies in the story and the timelines - warning: serious spoiler alerts follow: Cameron has been married to Dodge for eight months but she has been having an affair with Ingrid (Marilyn) prior to that marriage. They plot to kill Dodge, after the marriage, and do so fourteen months later. Hang on...they were only married for eight months. By my count Cameron/Dodge had to have been married for at least 15 months. The French House is rented by Dodge but Pilgrim says to Cameron you own it now [because he's dead]. Dodge never owned the house. The sunken Roman ruins beneath fathoms of water are turned into a dance floor for a rave party at a king tide. This is nonsense. Tidal range in this region is very small and even if the dance floor was exposed on a big low tide it would be completely flooded again within minutes on the reverse cycle. Yet the hundreds of guests for this spectacle take hours to arrive. The inconsistencies repeat all over the place. Pilgrim has apparently contemplated the art works that he has inherited many times but he is only briefly informed of this surprise inheritance during his critical mission. These timeline inconsistencies and others are continuous throughout the novel and they drove me nuts. I don't think Hayes had a clue what year it was because nothing in terms of time in the progress of the novel made any sense. The scenario of Ingrid(Marilyn)walking away from being in the midst of 9/11 and, at that moment, carefully plotting a murder one year later with a motive of identity theft is one of the most ridiculous constructs that I've ever read. Her concept for the perfect crime doesn't make sense either. I won't even bother to dip into the utter absurdity of the Saracen character...who apparently breaks into the most secure Syrian facility using the eyes of another man and his body weight...a facility that apparently doesn't have any CCTV??? Yet when his father is beheaded years before there is CCTV in a public square??? Give me a break. I could go on and on about the sheer absurdity of this novel. The ending is to vomit for. I was particularly annoyed by Hayes using the term \"the wine dark sea\" as his implausible and shallow hero sails off into the sunset. \"The Wine Dark Sea\" is the title of a novel by a much, much more accomplished author. This is truly crap at every level. I can't wait to miss the movie. ...more It's been almost a week since I finished this book and I still can't find the words to describe it. It's INSANELY good. Ridiculously clever and well thought out - the kind of book that begs the question HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE WAS ABLE TO THINK OF THIS, WRITE IT DOWN AND PULL IT OFF.

While you were traveling you always met other travellers and you tended to swap finished books which saved on carrying an accumolating amount of books with you. The most popular book were by King & Ludlum, having one of those made you always more popular when it came to trading. This book has a similar feel to it when Ludlum still lived and wrote his books. His hero's were always plunged into some worldwide conspiracy theory and he seemed out of place, over his head and all alone except for some unexpected friends. I am Pilgrim is about a previous talented intelligence officer whose livelyhood dissapears overnight when the the Twin Towers terrorist attack happens. The man decides to write a book on detecting and it is considered brilliant by a small company that understands it and reads it. Then he essentially retires from the world of spyhood. However he gets tracked down by an amateur who did not believe in the alias used by the retired spy when he published the book. The two men find a common ground and strike up a friendship. The spy returns to the US and makes sure that his tracks gets covered up decently so that nobody can find him again. When his friend a NYPD police lieutenant asks him to have a look into a rather flabbergasting murder, because it is not unlike a certain chapter in his book, the consequenses are that his being there gets noticed by another spymaster. And he is used as a pathfinder / specialist to find a man who threatens the security of the US. A single man without an apperent organisation is aiming his talents and intellect to strike at the US with a nightmare scenario. A smart and well written thriller that is a bit of a page turner and bloody hard to lay down, as I noticed having read the book within 48 hours. It can easily match some of Ludlums best books and that is some great compliment in my humble opinion. This book was recommended by some very positive 007 fans who thought that this book was the best spy novel to appear in years and was well worth anybody his/her time if you like the genre. While the book is a bout spycraft it also tells the story of the lone warrior/terrorist, and the story makes him human with a burning passion. The book is not black & white when it comes to telling the various sides of this thriller. It being a spythriller as well as murder mystery and a tale of travel. As I wrote before the positive feedback on this novel was too loud to simply ignoring it, as I tend to steer clear of the hype that can be heaved upon books. Later on I check the reviews to find out if it is really worth my while. I am glad to say that this book is worth all the positive attention it received. And I am glad to know that there will be a sequel or two, whic hwill tell us if Mr hayes can match the quality output of mr Ludlum in his living years.
