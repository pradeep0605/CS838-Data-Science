Never thank a fairy for services rendered. 2. Never eat fairy food. 3. Never dance with fairies. 4. Never strike a bargain with a fairy unless you've agreed on the fine points. <+++>The Iron King</+++> is a book about a sixteen year old girl, Meghan Chase. Can I advise all people reading this review: never be sixteen. It's a horrible age. Avoid it as much as you can. Meghan is dragged into the fairy world when her younger brother is replaced by a changling. She soon discovers she has deeper ties to fairy than she'd originally thought. The Iron King,<---M> like many modern day fairy tales</---M>, tries to adhere to old school fairy myths yet still manages to balls up and humanize certain fairies with all the eagerness a coming of age book about a sixteen year old on a magical adventure CAN balls up and humanize fairies. I take particular exception to the depiction of famous fairy Robin Puck's character and the introduction of romantic lead, Ash. The fact that Robin Puck has been turned from a wicked, mischeivous sprite with a penchant for disaster, into competition for a sixteen year old's affections was really just traumatizing to me. Suddenly Puck is sexy, serious, occasionally brooding and suave. Excuse me while I choke back tears and reread A Midsummer Night's Dream. We've gone from: To: Emo fairies are the new mythology, folks. Meghan Chase is not a complete idiot. Her handling of the Goblins and her occasional ability to use her brain redeems what would otherwise be another atrocious YA paranormal adventure. The two or three times she redeems herself and isn't completely useless, however, is quickly overshadowed by her inability to move the fuck out of the way of charging, rampaging monsters trying to eat her. She has a serious case of Damsel in Distress. Over all, the story isn't too bad. It's simply hard to ignore all the elements so obviously drawn from other inspiration. The Packrats are cute versions of the female packrat in The Labryinthe, Grim is so much like any other talking cat guide that I'm wondering if there's a book written on the subject for aspiring authors. The whole plot of getting the younger sibling back from the fairies is already such an overused cliche. The thing is, I did kind of enjoy this book after a while, though it took a long time to stop rolling my eyes. I will read the next book in this series but only because it left off on a little bit of a cliff hanger and I want to find out what happens next. *shakes fist* Emo Fairy wants your soul!

Yes there are those faerie courts and A Midsummer Night's Dream characters (Oberon, Titania, etc), but they are necessary for the make-up of the story. From here on out, Julie Kagawa makes THE IRON KING shine in the already-faerie inundated YA world. Julie Kagawa writes in a style that is easy and refreshing to read. She doesn't weigh you down with a barrage of information, rather, she slowly immerses the reader into her world, page after page. Descriptions flow off the page and her tone is never stilted. It's narrated in first person point of view, through Meghan's eyes, and I found this great because she had a voice that was believable and easy to relate to. The thing I loved most about THE IRON KING was its multiple story lines. Meghan embarks on a journey that takes her far and wide, to diverse regions of Faeryland and all over America. There wasn't just one set plot where she travels into the Summer court and stays there for the rest of the novel. Nope, her quest brings her from one plot to another, from one crisis to a new one, from one mission to the next. THE IRON KING has a more action and adventure feel to it, though that is not to say it didn't have romance. There was a love story, but it did not overwhelm the fantasy-like realm of the Nevernever (faery land) and its unique and engaging inhabitants. First off, I love the feel of THE IRON KING. It's like a quest in the sense that Meghan, the main character, encounters all sorts of odd and malicious beings along the way as she nears her main goal. Unlike many faerie books out today, there was SO much going on! And in a good way. The story wasn't just about faerie drama and court intrigue, although there was a good portion of that in the beginning, which was actually done in a superb way. There was a lot of fighting, which was written well so it wasn't boring- usually, I dislike fight scenes for their dull descriptions and constant sword clashing, etc, but in THE IRON KING, I was actually very very enthralled! The romance was very well done as well. There was a \"love triangle\" going on, although that was subtle and not very well emphasized because one love interest took the backseat to the other, in a good way. I love the push and pull, the chemistry between Meghan and the guy, which was very believable and made it all the more satisfying when they admit their feelings, sorta. And the characters! I loved them all, which is a rarity in these types of books, where only the main character and one or two others stand out and all others are only fleetingly described or mentioned. Meghan has a companion in a Cheshire-like cat named Grimalkin, whom I adored, and all the other characters were well fleshed out to the point where I could visualize them in my mind and understand their actions. THE IRON KING is reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland in that there is this feeling of being in an alternate and extremely quirky and surreal setting, which is true to an extent because a lot of the novel takes place in the Nevernever, home to the faeries. Although THE IRON KING is only 368 pages, it was 368 pages of captivating adventure and page-turning action. I wholeheartedly recommend this to all those who love faeries, and ok- everyone else too! ...more NO! I almost DNF-ed this one. It just irritated me to no end :( But then I met Ash. He deserves the 3 stars here <3 You know, sometimes less is more. The Iron Fey universe obviously doesn't know of the concept \"less\" :((( Up to 40%, the heroine sees about a 150 different creatures, a bit less in the second half but overall she sees a million of them and they're all described like crazy.

The Iron Fey universe obviously doesn't know of the concept \"less\" :((( Up to 40%, the heroine sees about a 150 different creatures, a bit less in the second half but overall she sees a million of them and they're all described like crazy. I know, now you're thinking, Blacky you're a moron or your brain is non-existent for not being able to cope with a hundred million creatures in one book, but let me tell you how it is to read about it. she sees a weird creature. it looks like this and this and does that and that. next page. she sees two creatures that try to kill her and they look like this and this and do that and that. next page. she sees one creature that helps them and he looks like this and this and his house looks like that and that next page. she sees a horde of creatures that try to kill her next page. she sees a weird creature that saves her and it looks like this and this she again sees a bunch of creatures that try to kill her next page. she sees 5 different creatures that look weird and scare her next page. she gets warned not to go to a dangerous place where the weird creatures live but she STILL goes to the dangerous place and those weird creatures try to kill her next page... ... and so, by the time we get to her actually meeting Ash, there is absolutely NOTHING happening in the book except her seeing creatures and those creatures trying to kill her or save her. Seriously, absolutely NOTHING happening. Though, even after she meets Ash, she still gets creatures that try to kill her all over again and some new ones that try to save her. So basically, all the story in this book is the \"world building\" that was just over extensive because after the 100th creature I met, I didn't give a sh*t about any other and the more she saw the more I wanted to stop reading. Yeah, I have a problem but damn, I just couldn't take it. Another problem here is that she meets Ash at about (view spoiler) [...45 (hide spoiler) ] %!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously????????? He's the only thing worth reading in the book and the REAL story starts at about 60 % I think, which is a shame and a f*cking waste of reading time as far as I can see, but oh well. The heroine is really, really irritating , she got on my nerves from page one, I don't like the way she thinks, I don't like the way she acts, she's one of those \"if I can do anything wrong you bet your ass I'll do it and mess up everything\". She made unnecessary deals with just about anyone and that just proved how damn stupid she is. Robin , he is OTT too. I didn't like him, though I probably should but dunno :( He's too funny and too quirky and too everything. So I guess I did a huge rant here ahahhahhha I can say what I actually LIKED here... The whole concept of the Summer Fay, the Ice Fey and the Iron Fey is really great and has huge potential, if (let's hope) the second book actually has a story for more than 40% it'll be great because (let's hope) we're done with the introduction of the world and it's creatures and it can just move on normally. Ash <3 He has silver eyes and is an enemy to Meghan <3 I love how the story went after he was introduced in the book, I can't say about it because it would be spoiling, but let's just say that it went from DNF to 3 stars :)))) So, I may try the next book because this series DOES look like it has potential to be awesome, and I DID read that they get better and better as it goes along.

I really liked Julie Kagawa's writing and fresh ideas !I guess the only reason I didn't give the Iron King 5 stars is that it took me a while to adjust to its world and magic ,but once I was sucked in,I enjoyed it very much!My favorite character has to be *drum roll* Ash (of course),he is the result of the perfect combination; brooding,dark,sometimes an asshole with a tragic back story who needs someone to make him feel alive again.And gorgeous. Of course. Puck was an entertaining addition,but I sense a love triangle in the making and I hope it will not cause unnecessary drama.Grimalkin the sassy cat was a pleasant surprise,a mysterious being with vast knowledge and hidden agenda.And then,there is Meghan.Thankfully she is not annoying and I actually like her,despite her being stubborn and immature at times. All in all,a very good first book in an interesting series,I'm looking forward to the next one.And note this,Ash is mine . ...more Final rating: 3/5 stars Final rating - for the whole series: 3.5/5 stars To venture in a world of The Iron Fey, you must proceed with this knowledge: 1.

You will without any doubt fall in love with two heroes - they will make you swoon. Now this was interesting experience \u2665 I love fey, they are my favorite paranormal creatures (and yes, i love and will always love evil fey ideas) and i love Julie Kagawa since her Blood of Eden series , which was fantastic! I know this book was one of her earlier works, but i can't help but compare it to BoE series. While BoE has strong and kickass heroine, this series has weak and angsty one - and it really bothered me, which is why i gave it one star less. Still, it was quite interesting and it kept my attention so it was bearable to ignore Meghan. Well, i am overreacting - she wasn't that bad - she just bored me sometimes . Alas, i heard that the other sequels get really and much better , so i am still having high expectations, while i lowered them for this one. But it surprised me and made me eager for more. The world building was quite interesting. The Nevernever world was really well done and i love how Kagawa always describes the surroundings in quite a good amount of details. I could imagine everything perfectly and that is a big + from me. I just can't help but admire Kagawa's writing style \u2665_\u2665. And like every other young adult book - this one too has a love triangle. And i didn't mind it . God, what is happening to me, i used to hate love triangles! But here...it makes it even more difficult because there are Ash and Robin (aka Puck, which i will refer as Robin because its prettier) and i love them both. The last 40% of the book i absolutely loved which is the reason i didn't give the first book less than 4 stars. P.s. everytime Ash and Puck argue or fight, it reminds me of this: \u25ba STORY : Once upon a time, there was a normal girl. She was living in a poor family, with her mother, stepfather and step brother. She had best friend who was always there for her. Meghan chase thought she was normal, she lived normally, she has a good life, even though it sometimes wasn't kind. Her father disappeared when she was young and her mother married another. And gave birth to Ethan, Meghan's step brother. She likes hanging out with Robbie, her best friend. He was always there for her, no matter what. But when she finds out that her brother Ethan was kidnapped, and that a changeling was put in his place, she doesn't know what to do. She learns from Robbie that he was kidnapped by a Fey and that he can help her bring him back. But its so hard to believe in it - until he takes her to Nevernever, homeland to all Fey. For those who took interest in fey, then you heard of Seelie and Unseelie courts, some of the names like Mab, Oberon and Titania, the fairies' fear of iron and metal. And add all those supernatural creatures like dryads, goblins, gremlins, kelpies, ogres and so on. It's all in here, waiting for you to go and be sucked into it just like Meghan was. \u25ba CHARACTERS : \u2666 Meghan : The main character and narrator of this story. Once a normal girl, she finds out that she is not what she thought she was. She was never prepared for what would happen to her and it makes her miserable, sad and devastated. But she is not giving up - she would do anything to get people she loves back, even if it means making bad choices. \u201cYeah, Mom, Ethan\u2019s turned into a monster and my best friend thinks he\u2019s a faery. How was your day?\u201d In a way, i understood Meghan, she was alone, she was afraid and it was all knew to her. And unknown. And it is scary when you are thrown in a world you know nothing of, and when you don't know the rules. \u2666 Puck/Robin Goodfellow : Robin was Meghan's best friend in our world - he is a fey and he was sent to protect Meghan. And he would do anything for Meghan. Even break the rules. \u201cI guess the sacrifice of my dignity is the only thing that will save us now. The things I endure for love. The Fates laugh at my torment.\u201d He was amazing character, extremely fun, sarcastic but not so kind either...especially to his enemies. I loved all his comments, and he made me laugh so many times and he was just awesome. \u2666 Ash : Ash, son of Mab, the queen of the Unseelie/Winter court. Ash, the third Unseelie prince and enemy to the Summer/Seelie court. Ash, the completely stubborn, sometimes evil SOB but also kind, brave and horrifically awesome. \u201cCombat doesn't have to be with swords... Emotions can be deadly weapons, and knowing your enemy's breaking point can be key to winning a battle.\u201d Ash... sigh... i am in love. At first, i kind of hated him, but as the story progressed i couldn't help but fall in love little, slowly and in the end completely. \u2666 Grimalkin : The true hero of the story for me would be Grimalkin the cat. Always there to make bargains, promises and save the day. And he keeps many many mysteries and secret...because... \"I am a cat,\" purred Grimalkin. Sigh....why don't you turn into a sexy prince so i can fall in love with you too? \u2666 Everyone else : Oberon => meeeeeeeeeeeeeh, you didn't give me enough reason to like you. Titania => erm... *coughbitchcough* Mab => you are not better than them either...but we shall see :P Ethan => cuuuuuuuuuuute \u2665 and the rest bla bla bla.... too tired to write and i would just spoil the story. \u25ba OVERALL : Loved it. I love everything related to fairies and this was nice addition to my fairy mania. Anyway, i look forward to other books and for more Ash and Puck \u2665 \u25ba REVIEW(S) RELATED TO THIS BOOK: \u25c9 The Iron King (The Iron Fey, #1) \u25c9 Winter's Passage (The Iron Fey #1.5) \u25c9 The Iron Daughter (The Iron Fey, #2) \u25c9 The Iron Queen (The Iron Fey, #3) \u25c9 Summer's Crossing (Iron Fey, #3.5) \u25c9 The Iron Knight (Iron Fey, #4) \u25c9 Iron's Prophecy (The Iron Fey, #4.5) \u25c9 The Lost Prince (The Iron Fey: Call of the Forgotten, #1) \u25c9 The Iron Traitor (The Iron Fey: Call of the Forgotten, #2) \u25c9 The Iron Warrior (The Iron Fey: Call of the Forgotten, #3) This review can be found on my blog: infinity-of-time.blogspot.com also known as... ...more \u201cSomething was happening, something strange and creepy and terrifying, and the scariest part of all was that it wore a familiar, ordinary face.\u201d 3 1/2 stars.

While The Immortal Rules series is still Kagawa's winner for me so far, I was actually really pleasantly surprised by this book. Almost everyone I know picked up this series a few years back and I deliberately avoided it. YA paranormal with a love triangle? Yeah, no thank you. But I've been meaning to see if I was wrong ever since I really enjoyed The Immortal Rules ... and this first installment is bursting with Kagawa's trademark humour and a likable cast of secondary characters. It's far from perfect but I've heard it's the weakest book of the series. We shall see. The foundations of the story aren't breaking any new ground - an awkward teenager called Meghan Chase discovers that the world isn't quite what she first expected when her brother gets kidnapped and taken to the Nevernever (Fey world). She must then go rescue him with the help of her friend Puck and other interesting creatures she meets along the way. Of course, things aren't that simple and Meghan uncovers a bunch of dark secrets that have remained hidden in the Nevernever for years. Despite the familiar premise, The Iron King had a completely different atmosphere to most of the YA paranormal genre. A lot of the genre is very loosely based in fantasy and more focused around the central romantic angst, which this book wasn't, in my opinion. It has a very Alice down the rabbit hole or A Midsummer Night's Dream kind of feel to it, almost dreamlike at times and full of magic and illusions. There is some romance, of course, like when Meghan tries to convince herself that Ash is definitely not Mr Sexy: \u201cThat is Ash, prince of the Unseelie Court. He tried to kill Puck, and he might try to kill you, as well. He is not sexy. He\u2019s not.\u201d But I think what I like most about Kagawa's work is that she creates a wonderful balance between dark, fast-paced survival stories, and hilariously charismatic characters. I admit that this story gets a little messy at times with the influx of every paranormal Fey-like creature imaginable, popping up one after the other and causing drama, but I think the series may have been finding its footing. My love for the characters started with Puck, whose sense of humour was EXACTLY the kind I love: \u201cCharming,\u201d Puck commented, gazing around in distaste. \u201cI love the barren, dead feel they\u2019re going for. Who\u2019s the gardener, I wonder? I\u2019d love to get some tips.\u201d and \u201cOh, we're playing nice now? Shall we have tea first? Brew up a nice pot of kiss-my-ass?\u201d I'm sure Kagawa is going to try and persuade me to change my mind, but Puck is so much more my type than Mr Broody smoldering gaze (Ash). I've said before that I can be sold on a love triangle if it's told well and I think this is one I could get invested in. And then there's Grimalkin. \u201cI am a cat,\u201d Grimalkin replied, as if that explained anything.\u201d Kagawa put an hilarious, completely lovable, frequently sarcastic cat in her book. How could I not love it?! He is easily my favourite character so far, Puck coming in a close second. The only character that hasn't wowed me yet is Meghan herself, but it also took a while for me to like Allison in The Immortal Rules so hopefully the MC love will come later. As I said, this book is far from perfect; but it is enjoyable, fast-paced fantasy. And sometimes that's all I want.

In this anti-science, anti-reason, anti-all-that-is-separating-us-from-the-beasts novel, fairies are born of human dreams and imagination. The more people imagine, the more the fairies are born/grow stronger/have magic/fuck the reader, because this book can\u2019t decide which of those options it wants and doesn\u2019t care enough to clarify. Imagination = ~*~*~SOMETHING MAGICAL, OKAY, DON\u2019T QUESTION IT~*~*~ And Faeryland is diminishing because people aren\u2019t imagining much anymore. Seriously, just the fuck are you thinking, book? We\u2019re more imaginative than ever right now. Know why? Because 90% of the population isn\u2019t engaged in back-breaking labor from sun-up to sun-down. We\u2019re at the most imaginative point in history. We have hundreds of thousands of people who literally do nothing but sit and imagine up stuff all day. And I\u2019m just talking entertainment here. That\u2019s not including teenagers on youtube. And that\u2019s also not including scientists, engineers, architects, anyone who ever had a dream and went out to make it real. If you sit there and tell me the guys that built the first rocket ship had no imagination, I will punch you in the face. They imagined up rocket ships to the moon. Ones that actually work . We are hellaimaginative. So already this book fails like a penguin is Equator. But then it gets worse. Because you see, in this book, we have \u201cIron Fey,\u201d which is what you\u2019d think: fairies that are made of or immune to iron. Supposedly they\u2019re born from the whole electronics craze/industrial revolution/maybe/fuck the reader, because this book doesn\u2019t want anything to be clear. They even go so far as to have a fairy named \u201cVirus\u201d who uses little tiny computer bugs, because that\u2019s clever, right? So\u2026fairies take on the aspects of whatever it is the people were dreaming about? Then how the fuck did this Winter/Summer Court of fairies come to exist? Because, seriously, when in history have we dreamed more about frolicking in nature than we have about tearing nature down and building our own shit in its place? OH RIGHT, FUCKING NEVER. Literally the first thing that the first human did was go out and chop the shit out of nature so he could burn that motherfucker down. And, you know, invent fire and cook his food. At least, I assume that\u2019s the first thing he did, but if not it was at least the second or third thing. So how did our long and glorious tradition of razing nature to the ground and building cities on her rotting corpse turn into the traditional fairies that populate this book, but our tradition of doing that \u2013 just with better tools \u2013 turned into evil monster fairies? BUT WAIT, IT GETS BETTER. Because we get to meet the very first Iron Fey to ever be imagined into existence. He came about during the fucking Iron Age . Yeah, these guys have been around since iron tools were first invented, but they weren\u2019t as powerful as the nature fairies, because\u2026fuck all if I know. We\u2019ve been gaga for iron ever since we figured out we could tie it to the end of sticks and kill stuff with it. And yet what have we ever done for Oberon? Some dude wrote him into a play (and did that relatively recently, compared to the fucking Iron Age ) and now we make high school kids read about, which most of them don\u2019t do because purists refuse to translate Shakespeare into teenage-speak. But the iron guy remained weak throughout the ages, but Oberon is totally all butch and powerful and shit. So as we get into things, we find out these Iron Fey are destroying the pure and gorgeous nature homes of the traditional fairies. Okay, I can roll with that. Then we get to their own iron kingdom, and the whole place is full of acid rain and trash and broken shit and just basically every single negative aspect of technology, but magnified times a million, and also that\u2019s all there is. Bweh? Why? Why to the Iron Fey get only the crapshit of the dreams that made them, but over in Oberon\u2019s land there\u2019s no\u2026I don\u2019t know, swamps or cacti or mudslides or tar pits? Well, it\u2019s because this book doesn\u2019t give a shit about saying anything actually subtle or meaningful. It just wants to throw crap in your face like an irate monkey. None of it adds to any sort of discussion about technology vs environmentalism, because it\u2019s too busy being so fucking extreme that none of it makes sense. You can say \u201cnuh-uh\u201d just by pointing out that scientists actually have to imagine shit or else there wouldn\u2019t be any science because REALLY DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT SCIENCE IS ? And that\u2019s on top of everything else that makes this novel just brain-bashingly stupid, but other reviews have covered that thoroughly. It had its high points, and to be honest the majority of the novel was\u2026if not good, at least on an even keel. But the low points just have this tendency to jump out and slap you in the fact and spit in your hair, so that the end result is that I didn\u2019t care about the okay bits because it was overall just such a terrible experience. ...more I don't think there's anything further I can add to what's already been said about this legendary book.

The plot in a nutshell: Meghan's little brother Ethan has been acting strange, and it turns out he has been replaced by a changeling. She and her long-time best friend Robbie (more popularly known as Robin Goodfellow, or Puck) goes into the Nevernever to rescue him. Along the way, she discovers the truth about herself, encounters numerous dangers (and a cat), and falls in love. Sounds like your typical YA fantasy, right? Oh, but this is so much more. As someone with a short temper for TSTL characters and unbelievable characters, I can tell you that there is nothing I can complain about here. I was starting to write a list of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, but there is so few of the latter two. And whatever there is that is ugly in this book is so eloquently described that it becomes beautiful, if only the writing. So here's the list of everything I love about this book. The setting The Nevernever, in all of its lands and aspects, are beautifully and vividly described. A warm breeze blew into the closet, carrying with it a shocking assortment of smells\u2014smells that should not be together in one place. Crushed leaves and cinnamon, smoke and apples, fresh earth, lavender, and the faint, cloying scent of rot and decay. For a moment, I caught a tang of something metallic and coppery, wrapped around the smell of rot, but it was gone in the next breath. And the creatures... In the scattered moonlight, faeries danced and sang and laughed, calling out to me from a distance. Satyrs whistled tunes on their pipes, piskies buzzed through the air on gossamer wings, and willowy dryads danced through the trees, their slender bodies waving like grass in the wind. The writing and environment so often makes or breaks a book, and in this case, it enhances the feel of a beautiful and dangerous world. The characters Meghan is such a fantastic heroine. She is strong, tough, but so vulnerable. She acts impulsively sometimes, but never endangers herself or her loved ones needlessly. Meghan has her faults; she is obstinate and headstrong at times, but it's in a believable and rather sympathetic manner. I slipped into the baggy jeans and the wrinkled, smelly T-shirt, feeling a nasty glow of satisfaction as they slid comfortably over my skin. Burn my things, will he? I thought, dragging my sneakers out and shoving my feet into them. Little acts of rebellion...who among us hasn't dressed improperly for an important occasion as a teenager? Meghan's little acts of foolishness are largely harmless, the defiance of a teenager instead of willful obstinacy, and I like her all the more for it. Puck is Puck. He is capricious, a trickster, but he has more depth than that of a court jester. He is truly devoted to Meghan, and the mistakes that he made in the past has made him even more protective of her. Puck is even willing to endanger himself and endure punishment for the sake of his friend, and I am glad that he is by Meghan's side as she continues her quest. He adds an element of lightness to the serious feel of the novel, and his seemingly lighthearted stance is invaluable in helping Meghan keep her spirits up when things are fearful. Ash: Oh man, what a dreamboat. I love a good reformed rake in my Regency novel, and while this is in no way a similar story, Ash is the kind of bad boy that's every fangirl's dream. He is dark, scarred; he has a difficult past and a hard life as the son of Mab. His courtship with Meghan...if it can be called that, is a rough one. They're enemies, and he did try to kill her... \u201cWhat!\u201d I stared at him in disbelief. \u201cYou tried to kill me!\" \u201cTechnically, I was trying to kill Puck. You just happened to be there. But yes, if I\u2019d had the shot, I would have taken it.\u201d Their reluctant alliance and their growing feelings for each other are so gradual that I can't even recall the exact moment when Meghan falls for Ash...or hell, when I fell for Ash. Grimalkin: I don't think I've ever met a talking cat I didn't like. I've loved talking cat guides in every fictional reincarnation I've ever read, be it the Cheshire Cat or Edgewood Dirk, and I can say no less about him in this book. I love his selfishness, his wicked sense of humor, his questionable morals, and his wisdom... \u201cThe Nevernever is dying, human. It grows smaller and smaller every decade. Too much progress, too much technology. Mortals are losing their faith in anything but science. Even the children of man are consumed by progress. They sneer at the old stories and are drawn to the newest gadgets, computers, or video games. They no longer believe in monsters or magic. As cities grow and technology takes over the world, belief and imagination fade away, and so do we.\u201d The plot itself is fast-paced and action-filled. There is a lot that goes on in this novel; typically, I hate it. I like things to stay in one place. Rapid changes in settings are so often poorly done and lose my interest and credibility, and just confuse the hell out of me. This is not the case with The Iron King . Everything is paced as it should, and though the book moves rapidly, I never feel lost. I'm so glad I reread this book; it only improves in the reading. ...more This book was outstanding.

Absolutely loved Meghan\u2019s character. Strong, independent, stubborn, selfless. This is the kind of character that you want to read about, the kind of character that you admire. Not to mention the absolutely compelling cast of supporting characters... Puck, Ash & Grimalkin. There aren\u2019t many times, especially in a debut, that I find myself genuinely enjoying and being impressed with all the characters. There are usually one or two that really stand out, and the others fade in the background, that\u2019s not the case with The Iron King. This book has it all..... action, romance, humor, intrigue! Not to mention it\u2019s exceptionally written. This is part of a three book series, but the first book wraps up nicely and sets up perfectly for the next novel, The Iron Daughter. Absolutely recommend this book! Can\u2019t wait to get my hands on the next one!

If you've no tolerance for angsty, bratty, obtuse heroines, steer right clear of it.** **3.5-ish?** Julie Kagawa\u2019s YA novel is an interesting treatment of Celtic legend, with characters reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland and the movie Labyrinth. Kagawa\u2019s vision of Faerie (or the NeverNever) is fully-realized and her particular talent lies in description--her world feels incredibly alive. I can picture most of her landscapes down to the finest detail, yet the prose never feels bogged-down or over-wrought. It\u2019s clear that this rendition of Faerie is oh so vivid in Kagawa\u2019s mind. Meghan Chase is thrust into this world with absolutely no warning. A socially-awkward teenager with only one true friend, she has no idea how to cope with the series of revelations made on her sixteenth birthday. The most stunning of these is that she\u2019s only half-human, and her parentage makes her a pawn in a game of power. The action that follows is fast-paced. Meghan has people to save, bargains to make, and hunters to avoid--all while adjusting to her newfound status. Kagawa\u2019s incredible attention to detail makes for some wonderful exchanges between Meghan and her companions. The brief moments of affection between Meghan and her ice-cold prince stand out because of the little things: a light caress, a puff of breath felt against her cheek, a quickened heartbeat. So too does the character of Grimalkin benefit from such impressive detail. Every haughty swish of tail and narrowing of eyes makes his character more lively, more real. The story also includes some unique twists on the usual Fae lore: the inclusion of steampunk elements. Since any UF reader knows the damage iron can do to the Fae, bringing metal and technology into the NeverNever is frightening. It flies in the face of everything we\u2019re accustomed to, yet it seems logical. Dreams of science, whimsies of technology--it only makes sense that these notions should have power too, and it creates a nice juxtaposition between magic and logic. So overall, I liked it. But I still had some problems with the story. Firstly, I mentioned both Alice and Labyrinth. Perhaps it\u2019s the recent effusion of Wonderland tie-ins, but the similarity between Grimalkin (who I do love) and the Cheshire Cat is too strong for me. Mad yet logical, helpful yet untrustworthy, and always knowing what\u2019s what, Grimalkin embodies everything that stands out about that Wonderland character. He even has the grin and a penchant for disappearing. Since I love the CC this isn\u2019t too much of a problem, but I kept searching for something that would separate him from the template--I didn\u2019t find it. As for the connection to Labyrinth \u2026well, if you\u2019re not familiar with the movie this won\u2019t matter, but I am die-hard obsessed with it. I have a funny feeling Kagawa might be as well. There\u2019s a Ludo moment of freeing the friendly beast; goblins who remind me of the Fireys as they debate what type of creature Meghan is; a host of metallic creatures reminiscent of the Humongous at the gates of Goblin City; a quest to save a child; and perhaps most notable of all are the creatures called \u201cpack rats\u201d who pile junk of all kinds onto their backs for safe-keeping. The similarities are striking, and Kagawa\u2019s world suffers for it in the eyes of this fan. Homage is one thing--these parallels run a little too deep. Continuing along that theme: Whenever I watch Labyrinth, I\u2019m always struck by the fact that I don\u2019t really like Sarah. Similarly, there are times when I don\u2019t feel much affinity for Meghan. She is quick to anger, and her intelligence escapes her at the oddest and most pivotal moments (she too would have ignored the Worm\u2019s warning \u201cDon\u2019t go that way! Never go that way.\u201d) Not the most rational girl, unfortunately. But at her core, she has a good heart and that is what\u2019s most important. Plus she\u2019s 16, so I suppose I must cut her some slack. But Ash! Her Winter prince. He is (I imagine) centuries old and has the reputation of being a remarkable tactician. So\u2026why would he willingly run headlong into a situation that maximizes his vulnerability? When a sneakier route to success--complete with element of surprise--is readily available? I don\u2019t know, but it severely lowered my estimation of his intelligence. Tactician. Pah. Lastly, I think the line editor's attention wavered at times. People who already had their arms crossed did so again two lines later, and folks who were standing were suddenly kneeling then standing again (perhaps they thought they were at a Catholic mass). The \"first time\" Ash uses Meghan's name is actually the second. Niggly things like that tend to bother me. It makes me want my red pen (unfortunately, not an option with an e-book). Indeed, there are some issues with this novel. Most of them rear their warped little heads about half-way through. In spite of this, I praise Kagawa for her vision, her masterful descriptions, the steampunk twist, and for her ability to weave Celtic mythology into the text. It\u2019s a very vivid world, and I will certainly visit it again. ...more Endearing Heroine? Check. Unique plot? Check. Gripping story that sucks you right in? Check.

But then I read Kagawa's \"The Immortal Rules\", and I admit, I was impressed, even if I thought the book had problems. So I picked this series up. Um... Well, first of all, I think that this is probably going to be one of those books where personal preference can make it or break it. I'm pretty sure that most people would like it - it's competently written, Megan is a proactive character, and the story is engaging. That said, this book contains three of my biggest pet peeves in fiction, YA or any other, and I cannot overcome them. Pet peeve #1: Treating your readers like idiots. I don't think that one was intentional, but oh, do I hate it when authors throw some pretty obvious hints at you and then, near the end of the book, have their point-of-view-character react to it like it's some huge reveal. Case in point: Puck and Ash fight all the time. They drop references about a grudge match, about someone dying, and about that someone being female. And then Megan is shocked, all-caps-SHOCKED, dramatic-kitty-gif-SHOCKED, that Ash had a girlfriend once. Really, Megan? Did you really have to have him spell it out for you? You couldn't piece it on your own, so you had to make him revisit a painful memory in detail so that he would explain to you something which the reader has known for 150 pages? Ash is so obvious about it, I expected to hear \"Bring me to Life\" whenever he made an entrance. Pet peeve #2: Cutesy child characters. This one wasn't so prominent here as it was in, say, Eve , but still, Ethan wasn't so much a character as he was a handy plot device to get the plot going. I get it that he wasn't with Megan, so there was no way to witness character development from him, but he could have been built up through his sister's memories of him instead. Alas, that doesn't happen. Megan thinks of her brother only in terms of having to save him and that's it - she doesn't revisit many memories of the two of them together, doesn't waver a moment in her determination... which more or less tells me that Kagawa doesn't know how to write something like that. Sibling relationships are not nice: they're rocky, especially if one of the kids is young. There is a constant rivalry going on for the parents' attention and approval. There is anger and resentment and pure frustration. We don't love our brothers and sisters because they're speshul snowflakes to the family, we love them in spite of it. A brother-sister relationship devoid of all feelings but love is frustrating and unrealistic, and reduces Ethan to the role of a plot device, and an emotionally manipulative one, since he's so young. And speaking of emotionally manipulative... Pet peeve #3: Attempted rape bringing people together. I linked this article in my review of Storm , but it bears repeating because it made me more aware than ever of how authors employ this particular construct. Kagawa doesn't pad the scene out like Meyer does - it's less than a page long, but it is used in The Iron King for the exact same purpose as in Twilight : to put the romantic leads in an emotionally vulnerable position that will bring them closer together. Authors? Please stop doing that. There are better ways to have your characters interact and grow to like each other. I get it that there is a short period of time, but it wouldn't kill you to postpone romantic development until the second or third book in a series. Rushed romance only tells me that you don't have your priorities straight. Furthermore, I can't buy Ash and Megan's \"love\" if all they have together is a handful of near-death experiences. I'm not surprised so many people are shipping Megan with Puck - at least there's enough set-up and backstory to those two. I hear that the story becomes better in later books, but what I've seen so far doesn't make me inclined to pick them up. If someone can change my mind, please, do so in the comments. If not, I think I'll leave that particular offering of Kagawa's for now. ...more Okay, I can't do this anymore. DNF at 62%.

Every time I thought hey Jun, you know you still have to finish The Iron King, right? , I found myself cringing and then procrastinating so that I somehow couldn't find the time to read it. Because, I'm gonna be really honest with you all, I hated everything about this book. It was so unbearably average, and I kept feeling like I had already read it a thousand times before. The whole story is based on the weakest of premises. Picture this: you suddenly find out that your little brother has been kidnapped by the fae folk, and in his place there is a monster that looks like him but is actually a vicious Changeling. Said creature has also attacked your mother, who is now in the hospital. Now, you have two options: kill the damn thing, which would cause the fae who have kidnapped your brother to give him back immediately, or go to the extremely dangerous Unseelie court in a long journey in order to retrieve him. I sure as hell know what I would've chosen, but of course the main character, Meghan, thinks it's a great idea to leave a kid in the fae world for weeks and to risk her own life, instead of going for the most logical option. O-kay. And again, of course her friend Puck - who is, mind you, Robin Goodfellow from effin' A Midsummer Night's Dream - doesn't think he should change her mind, or at least kill the Changeling himself and spare them a potentially fatal trip to the Unseelie court. No, he's just like: alright, let's go to the Nevernever then! PLEASE. Meghan is the biggest idiot you could possibly think of. No, seriously, she's the most insufferable main character I've ever read about. She never has any idea what to do and she prides herself on being \"different from other girls\", because they're all spoiled rich bitches who spend all day fixing their make up. Riiiiight. My hands are itching from how much I want to slap her. Not only she's the most typical Mary Sue ever, but she's also - really, I'm sorry, but there's no way to put this nicely - extremely stupid. She doesn't know or understand even the most obvious things about the fae world, keeps putting herself in danger and generally getting her ass kicked, and she's always terrified. She once runs into the woods during the night (yes, the woods of the really dangerous fae world I mentioned before) because she thought she saw her brother there, and almost ends up being eaten alive for the umpteenth time. *sighs heavily* But don't worry, there's more! Let's talk about the love interests, that don't seem to have any kind of personality of their own. No, wait, let's talk about the love triangle. Or about the insta-love? Yeah, I'll go with the insta-love. Yes, because Meghan meets this guy what, once? twice?, and she is already heads over heels for him. I'm serious. First time they meet: Ash, aka the dark brooding prince of the Unseelie court: I want to kill you and your friend. Meghan: AHHH I'M SO SCARED! You're also really hot. And scary. But mainly hot. Second time they meet: Ash: I'm going to kill you. But first, let's dance. Meghan: Wow!!!! So hot!!! I wonder what it'd be like to kiss him!!! Third time they meet: Ash: I'm going to kill you. But first, I want to kill your only friend. Friend: *tries to kill Ash* Meghan: No!!! Please, don't kill him!!! He's not as bad as you think he is!! I WANT TO SCREAM. The writing is average at best, and the plot basically consists of Meghan doing something stupid, a terrifying creature approaching (which is always described in minute detail. And there were like, a bazillion creatures. I felt like I was reading a fae world bestiary), and then Meghan getting rescued by someone else. Repeat for 100.000 times. I just want to forget this book even exists, so yes, I'm gonna stop here. What a waste of my time. ...more \"Of all the stupid ideas!

The book is undoubtedly pretty naive , childish at times, crammed full of annoyngly stereotypical narrative schemes , predictable and not particularly original in the execution nor in the concept , and yet it somehow still manages to be enjoyable . I am far, very, very far from loving it, but I can't say it was a regrettabble or boring read. The thing is, The Iron King is the most common , obvious , classical tale of faeries, and in part also fairytale, that you could ever imagine, and this ca be either a positive or a negative thing. Positive , because it takes but the blink of an eye to the reader to dive into this world, familiar to anyone who has so much as heard but bits and pieces about the Fair Folk and its mythology; on the other hand, negative because the whole thing sounds like a story we've all heard before. At the end of the book, I felt like this read had left me with nothing new, a sensation that I loathe with all my heart. But still, and I swear I cannot explain it myself, I don't feel like I can say this is an unworthy book, because I acknowledge it isn't, it isn't at all. It just may be, and I'm inclined to believe it, that it would suit way better than this a less experienced (please notice that I don't mean this term to be a compliment to me, just an objective statement regarding the number of fantasy books I've read so far) reader than I am. But back to us, let's see what we have. \u2022The plot , well, I think you got it: predictable, unoriginal, et cetera . Also, I think that the most logical thing for the Iron King to do would have been to (view spoiler) [kidnap her in the first place, because the excuse that Puck was to good of a guardian just doesn't hold up and is way too simplicistic (hide spoiler) ] . But of course, then there would have been no story to begin with. \u2022The world-building too is not particularly astonishing, and does not in the slightest bring about any new element in comparison with the mythology we all, more or less, know, but this doesn't change the fact that Kagawa depicts and enchanting and enchanted beautiful world to read about. Moreover, I happen to be extremely fond of what turns out to be the core concept at the heart of the whole story, which is to say, the reason of the existence of the Iron Fey , (view spoiler) [who are born from \"dreams of technology, progress and science\" (hide spoiler) ] . I like this so much because it is a very simple, intuitive and yet clever idea that. storywise, can have possibly unlimited consequences and applications. \u2022On the contrary, I am not very fond of the characters . Again, nothing bad in them (except when it comes to Meghan; just a minute), but they didn't conquer me the way I need to be conquered. Sorry guys. It's not you, it's me. And then there is Meghan . I know I am not tolerant with fantasy ya heroines and that I should probably try to be more malleable. It's just that I can't and, honestly, don't want to be. The 90% of them fall under the definition of stupid, passive or softie. Meghan Chase sets a new record by falling under all the three of them. The annoyance embodied , this girl. She is petty and whiney , she poses as some grand warrior of the people when in truth hides a fair amount of selfishness and is totally unable to grasp the idea that thinking before acting is maybe the smartest way to go . Half the troubles the characters have to face could have been easily avoided if she just managed to stay put and use her darn ears. I hated her to the bone. Now, who's next? *The Iron Daughter raises her hand* This way, please. ...more Ummm....WOW! That is how I felt after reading The Iron King. Simply amazing.

More reviews and more at Cuddlebuggery Book Blog . ...more The Iron King was an enjoyable read, but not exactly a memorable one. And while there were certain elements to it that were fairly original, the majority of the story felt like the same old tired scenario that Holly Black and Melissa Marr have already used. And because I'm ornery for details - the linguistically accurate term is fay , not fey . Just saying. For a protagonist, I certainly enjoyed Meghan Chase more than whosit from the Holly Black book and Madam Skank from the other author's book. Th The Iron King was an enjoyable read, but not exactly a memorable one. And while there were certain elements to it that were fairly original, the majority of the story felt like the same old tired scenario that Holly Black and Melissa Marr have already used. And because I'm ornery for details - the linguistically accurate term is fay , not fey . Just saying. For a protagonist, I certainly enjoyed Meghan Chase more than whosit from the Holly Black book and Madam Skank from the other author's book. Though prone to rash decisions and over-assumptive, Meghan seemed to have a good head on her shoulders and, when she wasn't jumping to conclusions, was a pretty reasonable character. Unlike a lot of other protagonists in fairy books, Meghan's motives and reasons for acting made sense to me, and she was easy to relate to - a definite plus. As for the other characters in The Iron Fey , I have to mention Grimalkin (the talking cat) and Puck...the dude from A Midsummer Night's Dream . Puck makes so many appearances in fiction nowadays, he's practically a stock character, and while I'm not sure I think he's a viable love interest, he was certainly a fun, sympathetic character. I like the way Kagawa portrayed him. Grimalkin the talking cat was definitely my favorite character - by a long shot. I guess I just have a thing for talking animals with a know-it-all and a Nell-if-I-care attitude. I tell you what, Grimalkin definitely had the best lines, that's for sure. And it just wouldn't be a modern fairy story without Meghan falling in love with a fairy...dude. Sorry, but for me, Prince Ash was the worst character in the book. I know he and Meghan are going to end up together - surely - but it's a shame. One of the drawbacks I've encountered in paranormal fiction is the near-constant appearance of this type of love interest: the smooth-talking, cocky, oft-smirking bad boy (view spoiler) [usually with a rakish/\"experienced\" past, too, which authors, for some puzzling reason, love to point out to their readers. Color me unamused (hide spoiler) ] . I just don't like bad boy characters as love interests, and I'd rather see them done-in than reformed, to be honest. So every scene with Ash had me rolling my eyes. And really, it's the reason I'm not keen on continuing the series with The Iron Daughter and The Iron Queen - I don't think I can stomach more Ash. Blah. It's a shame, too, because Julie Kagawa is a more than decent writer . Her style isn't overly-wordy and flowing with pace-slowing descriptions, but it isn't choppy, either. However, there was a repetitious pattern I noticed in The Iron King 's plot. I can't tell you how many times Meghan and company would encounter scary, nasty creatures...then escape. Then they'd encounter more scary, nasty creatures...then escape. Here's something that I've noticed: it really doesn't matter how many scary, nasty creatures the characters encounter. It really doesn't. Because if the reader has guessed that nobody's gonna die, and nobody's gonna lose a limb...it just doesn't have the same effect. As far as fairy books go, I'm not exactly sure why authors feel the need to portray fairies the same, worn way. The problem with portraying fairies amorally is that you really can't turn around and call the 'good guys.' Both of the courts (Summer and Winter, if I remember correctly) were portrayed the same way - so who are the good guys, and who are the bad guys? When the \"good guy\" characters act almost exactly like the \"bad guy\" characters, what kind of contrast exists? Tell me, how are Mab and Titania any different? And yet one is queen of the Unseelie Court...Unseelie usually implying malevolent. No contrast. And that's what frustrated me about the portrayal of fairies. (view spoiler) [I've since discovered that Lesley Livingston and Eoin Colfer do a MUCH better job at portraying fairies and fairy culture. I would suggest their books either in addition or instead of this one (hide spoiler) ] . Though I sound critical, I still enjoyed The Iron King , and I'm glad I read it. It was entertaining, but I don't really feel an overwhelming urge to continue the series. ...more Before I begin this review, I'd like to clear something up. Keep in mind, it is complete fact*: If there were 100 women in the world, 90 of those people would think long hair on a guy is gross. Of the 10 remaining women who aren't totally turned off by long hair, 8 of those women are scifi, fantasy, or romance authors. Julie Kagawa, what the heck? You took a guy that could be a total babe (okay, who am I kidding, he still is) and gave him \"silky\" long locks. Blech.

You took a guy that could be a total babe (okay, who am I kidding, he still is) and gave him \"silky\" long locks. Blech. This book took my ultimate nightmare topic--fairies--and turned it into something I could stomach, nay, something I thoroughly enjoyed . Meghan Chase is a teenager living in backwoods Louisiana. She isn't very popular but she does have a best friend. (whose family and house she very conveniently yet unrealistically never sees) Surprise! (but not really, this isn't really a spoiler) It turns out she is part-fey and must go into the Nevernever (I know, right?) to save her kidnapped brother. The only thing this book was missing was David Bowie in his tights. I mean, we all like Labyrinth, right? There are a few more similarities--namely, the poisonous fruit and the pack rats besides the baby (or 4-year old) retrieval quest. I also felt some similarities to The Princess Bride which is a pretty badass book compliment. Kagawa works in references to A Midsummer Night's Dream , both in terms of fey folklore and character names/traits but it doesn't feel forced. I have to say, I truly appreciated the update to current times. Fairy folklore is pretty alienating to me so I was/am excited that I was engaged and interested in what was going on despite so many random creatures and words. There are definitely a lot of characters and potential side plots that are introduced but it didn't bother me in this book. I knew going into it that it is the beginning of a series so I wasn't expecting everything to be wrapped up with a bow at the end. (this is very much NOT the case) Perhaps it was a case of great book at the right time, but I really hope not. I read it in one day, so it is definitely a quick read. The narrative moved quickly, the plot was fun, the pacing was mostly perfect (the ending felt a little hurried) and I couldn't find too many typos or annoying grammatical errors. (contrary to this review, which is probably riddled with them) And if ponytail-length hair on the male love interest is all I have to complain about, then this book must be pretty awesome:-) Can't wait to read the rest of the series! *Source: My opinion. ...more Beware of spoilers!

Robin Goodfellow (Puck) I haven't read A Midsummer Night's Dream . However, I am familiar with a few characters. The one that captured me most was Puck. I knew that he was the clever and mischievous one, and I like characters like that. I thought it was pretty creative how she based her characters off of Shakespeare's play. So for the actual Puck in this book. I loved him. For once, he wasn't an old, know-it-all, arrogant jerk that deprecated the heroine when she didn't know things or did something wrong. His answers were hilarious, brutally honest, and sarcastic. He tells Meghan off right there and then when she asks about something, instead of saying, \"Oh, don't worry, babe. I'm here. Everything will be alright.\" Evidence of Puck's beastly bluntness: This is Meghan and Puck referring to the Nevernever in the beginning. \"Will it be dangerous?\" \"Oh, extremely. That's what makes it fun. You can die in so many interesting ways - skewered on a glass sword, dragged underwater and eaten by a kelpie, turned into a spider or a rosebush, for all time.\" So when I read that, I sat there, thinking, I like, I like. However, to be frank, from Kagawa's physical description of Puck, I puked a little in the inside. Spiky red hair, bony frame, elf ears. *shudders* ME: HE'S NEVER GOING TO BE ATTRACTIVE! However, I never thought that someone so hideous, with his weird elvish features, would be so attractive. However, Kagawa does say that he has sharp features and a predator-like gaze. I mean, Meghan doesn't describe him as beautiful, but she ain't never called him ugly, dats fo sho. Gosh, he's incredible. *girlish scream* I love when guys have fun when they're fighting, not be all serious and brooding about it. I love Puck's sense of humor and the way he's confident, without seeming overly confident. He seems to have his flaws as well. He's impulsive and doesn't think about the consequences of what he does. That's for sure. According to Ash, he's an idiot. I don't say I completely agree on that. It's just that Puck doesn't hesitate when he wants to do something. But... but that only makes him cooler. Overall, he's my favorite character. He genuinely cares for Meghan. He's humorous, sarcastic, blunt, and just a very whimsical character. I love a man with a sense of humor and a bit of confidence. Yes, I have a crush on him. And I do want Meghan to choose him instead of Prince Ash. Very badly . I'll talk about that later. Before I go to the next character, I just hope that Kagawa is consistent with her traits for Puck. I hope Puck doesn't change... for anyone . I mean, sometimes, I'll love a character, but as the next book comes, they start to change and I start liking them a bit less. I hope that doesn't happen! Puck, don't change! You got dis! Grimalkin That scornful cat is the sole reason Meghan was able to travel through the NeverNever successfully. He basically memorized the whole NeverNever by heart. He offered to help at times. He gave her advice. He taught her about the things she can do with her power. Yes, Puck was behind it as well, but Grimalkin was a beast. I also loved his sly remarks. I love how he points out how stupid Meghan can be at times, since Puck and Ash are too busy fawning over Meghan to notice. Meghan Meghan Chase isn't that bad. I liked Meghan in the beginning. She is strong, patient, and willing to understand things. Skeptic at first (I would be). She's a bit clever at times. I loved how Kagawa didn't make her the \"all-powerful\" teenage girl who is exceptionally quick at grasping her power right after knowing she had a power at all. Then Ash comes along and turns her into an imbecile with his ridiculous good looks. What do I mean? A not-so-exact conversation between Ash and Meghan as they are dancing: \"It'll be bad. We'll probably have to go to war.\" \"War...? What does that mean?\" \"It means I'll kill you.\" Oh, and Ash says that in the most romantic way, by leaning in towards her and locking his eyes with hers. I would have been like, \"Excuse me while I ponder over what you just asked.\" That moment really needed the \"Puck Touch.\" Overall, I thought she was okay. However, sometimes she was just a bit stupid, especially around Ash. Prince Ash Ash is the typical male character from a fantasy book, in my opinion. 1. Devastatingly good-looking 2. Devastatingly good-looking 3. Devastatingly good-looking I'm not saying that's the only thing remarkable about him. It's just that he doesn't appeal to me as much as Puck does. I'm Team Puck. Ash doesn't have a sense of humor. At all. He's very serious and tense. And that moment when he did crack a \"joke\", it was lame. I scoffed at his attempt. I'm just saying that there wasn't much to him besides the fact that he's an excellent fighter, good-looking, and a bit charming. Oh, and incredibly loyal. I don't understand how Meghan just fell for him for his looks. It was slightly pathetic. She sees him practicing with this sword, half-naked, and bamn. I thought she was stronger than that. I mean, yes, she is a teenage girl with hormones. Still. It was just a bit too early for her to be feeling those emotions for him. Not just the \"You're so good-looking ones.\" The, \"Oh, he saved me so many times, I think I love him\" ones. I don't completely dislike Ash. I'm apathetic. It just seems to me like he's the typical, \"cold, I-don't-want-to-show-my-feelings-for-you\" type of guy. It wasn't anything new. He just bored me. Hopefully, in the next book, I know more about him than the fact that he's gorgeous and has silver, glittering eyes and black hair. The writing Okay, so the writing was my favorite aspect of this book. I could picture everything. Nevernever was truly a wonderful experience for me. The imagery, the details, the action scenes, etc. Everything was well-written. I seriously had girl-crushes on the fey women because of the intense descriptions Kagawa wrote about them. I thoroughly enjoyed her delicious writing. However, the only thing that irked me regarding her writing was the fact that it was a bit repetitive. Kagawa would write, \"He blinked. I blinked at his words. Grimalkin blinked.\" That's basically the only flaw I point out about her writing. And that's very small. I think there were other things that bothered me, as well. However, I cannot remember. EDIT: Oh, yes! There were some awkwardly worded sentences. \"Ash drew his sword and danced his way to the dragon.\" Danced ? Not the right word for such an intense scene, in my opinion. Phew! That was a workout. Anyway, TIK was just a very fun read. It was adventurous, beautifully portrayed, and the best fey book that I've read by far. ...more There's just something so satisfying in reviewing a much hated book that I genuinely liked a lot.

The opposite is rarer, but it does happen. Proof's The Iron King . Even if I read it in 2014, back in the time when I was new to GR and barely back to reading, I won't change my rating. Here's why. I loved this book. I loved Meghan (I know, I know, *GASP* and the likes) I loved the world. I regret nothing . This book managed to reach a part of me which had stayed forgotten for years. The part of me who watched The Never Ending Story , wide-eyed, and read Alice in Wonderland , eager to meet that odd cat and to visit whatever weird world on which I could put my hands. \"I don't even recognize myself.\" An image frashed through my head and I giggled with slight hysteria. \" I won't turn into a pumpkin when midnight comes, will I? \" \"If you annoy the wrong people, you might.\" Welcome trolls and goblins and squirrels nails! I love you all already. Quickly I found myself completely mesmerized and captivated by all the details brought to life by the descriptive writing. \"It's an elf,\" hissed another, giving me a toothy leer. \"An elf what lost its ears, maybe.\" \"No, a goat-girl,\" cried yet a third. \"Good eatin', them.\" \"She ain't no goat, cretin! Lookit, she ain't got no 'ooves!\" I giggled out of amazement. All the time. This said, I can see how fairy lovers could be annoyed, because all the rules aren't respected. I honestly didn't mind this time (for some reason??), but hey, to each their own. As many readers pointed it, that's not the most interesting storyline that I had the chance to read about, yet I couldn't put it down and felt like it just clicked into place nicely . Actually I was on the verge of writing that the pacing was fast, when I remembered that the majority of readers grew bored in the middle of the book. That wasn't my case. At all. I don't know if that can be explained by the fact that I'm such a sucker for fantasy and always have, I don't have a damn clue about it. Sorry. Oh, well. That's my review after all, so perhaps it should be taken with a grain of salt, but in my opinion this book is compelling and fascinating, as it was such a page-turner for me . *shrugs* And in the end... The surprise . Indeed all the concept of Iron Fey is truly fascinating. I don't want to spoil potential late readers like I was, so I won't say anything more about that but trust me : that's quite original and well, I loved it. Let me introduce you... The Infamous Meghan!! There's no denying that she isn't a kick-ass character, but you know, I'm feeling lenient with her because she never annoyed nor maddened me. Bu-bu-BUT ANNA! EVERYONE HATES HER! Well, I don't? I'm sorry? But not sorry??? Alright, let's be a little honest here, okay? Truth is, we all want to think that we would have morphed into some badass if we had been thrown into a fairy world at 16, and blablabla... Oh, wait. I don't want to think that. I already know that I wouldn't have been. Nah. I, for one, would have bitched around, paid no attention to any rule, annoyed the wrong people, petted Grimalkin.... and probably ended dead . Just admit it already, you wish you could have known my teenager self. Or not. Okay. I can live with that, now that I'm the champion at adulting. Haha. What's the saying again? LET'S BE MERMAIDS??? Anyway. Meghan. \"Time to switch to decaf, princess. If you're going to shriek at every bogey that jumps out and says 'boo', you'll be exhausted before we reach the edge of the woods.\" HOW can I be annoyed by Meghan if I shriek when I see a fucking spider? Huh? Meghan is no hero, but that's okay, because I didn't expect her to be. In my opinion she isn't dumb or infuriating, but she's actually pretty average and for me her personality fits perfectly in the plot developments. Furthermore, she knows her moments of pure awesomeness - \"Stop it!\" I hissed glaring at both in turn. \"Stop it right now! Put your weapons up, both of you! Ash, you're in no condition to fight, and, Puck, shame on you, agreeing to duel him when he's obviously hurt. Sit down and shut up.\" Moreover, I really enjoyed Puck and no, that's not because his character is one of my favorite from A Midsummer Night's Dream . Noooo. I couldn't trust him, but he made me laugh. \" Charming,\" Puck commented, gazing around in distaste. \"I love the barren, dead feel they're going for. Who's the gardener, I wonder? I'd love to get some tips.\" Here. Have a cookie. Oh, and maybe you're waiting for Ash ? Hmm... Can I just say that throwing ice darts is considered like cheating in my book? Yeah, yeah. I know. Brooding male-leads and all that. But I love him, period. Does their relationship flirt with instalove? Honestly? You really want to know? Sure? WELL. The Iron King is the kind of books where other reviews made me doubt myself. At the time I didn't get instalovish vibes coming from Meghan and Ash. Some scenes were surfing a little on that dangerous territory (view spoiler) [the kiss, for example (hide spoiler) ] but overall I found it pretty slow? Did my instalove radar was broken? Maybe? Am I wrong? You know what? MAYBE, but I'm done trying to explain myself about that. It didn't bother me, I didn't feel what others felt, and I won't try and pretend that's the case. I shipped them . Whatever that says about me, I don't care. I also don't agree about the Bella vibes in The Iron Daughter . Yes, yes, Meghan moped around at first, but let's be real : hello , she is *NOT* at home like Miss Bella. The rest is spoilers, but honestly? I would have fucking WHINED.

Human, a couple of Fey and a cait sith are looking for something; they go from one person to another, gain some clues and overcome some obstacles. The story itself is light and dark at the same time, really fast-paced and funny. Yes, funny. Like books by Kerstin Gier, those (and Iron King too) were written for teens, but even if you are already 40+, you still can enjoy them. Why? \u2018Cause they are hilarious. Naive romance? Well, yeah. Predictable plot? I guess so. Is it that bad? Nope. Because you would laugh reading it. Because you would in awe of the world Julie Kagawa suggests to you (she mixed up different mythologies and the result is really good). Because you would meet a cunning trickster and a mysterious dark prince. Because sometimes you would be scared! Kagawa\u2019s fairies are close to their canon. Even nice ones (from Seelie Court) are dangerous and would love to have a human or two for dessert. So, we have a girl named Meghan Chase (or 'Meghan Chase, we were waiting for you' as quite every Fey addresses to her), her brother was kidnapped by fairies and she is determined to bring him back. I can understand, when a changeling lives in your house you have a hard time to let such a situation be (especially, when he tries to eat your leg). Our heroine finds out that her friend is actually Puck, like a Puck from A Midsummer Night's Dream, that her father isn't her father and she herself is a half-blood Seelie Court's Princess. Surprise-surprise! Isn't that better than sweet-sixteen-b'day-car as a present? Meg doesn't think so. She would have to cross borders between human and Fey worlds, to visit three different Courts and to learn more about herself and those persons she thought she already knew well. Meet the cast: art-source Meghan (the girl whose hand Peter-Pan-ish boy tries to rip off). Nice MC with self-irony, pure heart and sharp-tongue. She\u2019s only 16, but I\u2019d like to imagine her a bit older. Acts like a normal person who is suddenly got that there are fairies among people and that she\u2019s only partly human. In other words, she freaks out at the start and feels insecurity during her Fey-journey. The bad is, she fell in instalove with a stranger... but let's pardon our inexperienced heroine, if you would meet the person she fell for... maybe you'd fall for him too) Robbie (the ripper). I thought he would be just another Mal, you know. All these childhood friends of average girls make me sick. And I was wrong, yay! This guy isn\u2019t that simple or easy to read. Red-haired, green-eyed, foxy\u2026 I mean, Rene Hasard plus Sturmhond. He is a friend of MC, her guard, her protector and we can tell that he has not only friendly feelings toward her, but Meg is blind and sees only the other boy. Grimalkin (the indifferent sleepy beast). Ah, THAT CAT! I'd marry him if I could. Smart, clever, cunning, wise, self-sufficing cait sith I grew to adore. The book could be written about this cute animal only and I would read it anyway. Ash (the boy who is at risk to stuck with a one-hand girl). What (rather who) I liked the most aside from Grimalkin is Ash. Oh, Ash. Yet another prince in my collection. Black hair plus silver eyes, so close to grey-ones (you know whom I'm referring to), tall, muscular, with his own agenda. I\u2019m a girl, I looove such characters!). This guy is a bit more noble and gentleman-ish for my liking, but it was the first book of the series, I expect some hot development later xDD A few facts to ignite your interest for this book: Puck and Ash are archenemies, there would be two kisses (cheek-one and lips-one), cait sith won't demand MC's firstborn (yet), a rabid Cinderella chimera would dance at the ball, our heroine would make a lot of bargains. Overall, Kagawa did impress me. She can make me smile and sad with bitter-sweet aftertaste (the ending), in other words, she makes me feel. I would gladly continue with this series (thank god all the books are already out and waiting for me to pick them up).

Faeryland has some neat stuff about it, and the glamour, plus the way agreements and favors work with faeries, are nifty. I also like all the Shakespeare references - not just Puck, Titania, and Oberon, but Grimalkin (who, because I'm a nerd, I know is the cat belonging to the three witches of MacBeth). Two things I did not know about this book before starting it: 1. It is the first of a trilogy 2. Its publisher is Harlequin Teen Perh To begin with, I should say that this book does some things well. Faeryland has some neat stuff about it, and the glamour, plus the way agreements and favors work with faeries, are nifty. I also like all the Shakespeare references - not just Puck, Titania, and Oberon, but Grimalkin (who, because I'm a nerd, I know is the cat belonging to the three witches of MacBeth). Two things I did not know about this book before starting it: 1. It is the first of a trilogy 2. Its publisher is Harlequin Teen Perhaps more importantly, two things this book actually did for me: 1. Taught me to skim. I'd never been able to do that before. Seriously. With fiction, at least. I'd slog through long paragraphs of description or angst, bored and annoyed, to get to when something actually happened. Now, I can go, This whole half-page is angst. Next! This newfound skill is a bit terrifying for me, though, because I don't want it to become a habit. I like to enjoy my reading. Why oh why is it so hard for me to just put a book down when I find myself not enjoying it? I don't know. But at least skimming is better than forcing myself to really read something I don't like. 2. Convinced me to go to Judo on a day when I felt kind of like wimping out , purely out of a desire not to be as useless as the protagonist of this book. Indeed, Meghan Chase could compete with Bella Swan in the Useless Protagonist Olympics events of Falling Over (and Being Caught Against the Icy-Cold Chest of Sexay Sexay Menz) and Screaming Ineffectually, and could definitely hold her own in the event of Being Kidnapped (and Rescued by Sexay Sexay Menz). Might actually dominate the field of Not Asking Obvious Questions Because Gods Forbid the Protagonist or the Reader Get to Find Out Something Interesting and Important. Not to mention the Doing Stupid Things in Faeryland special event, where she snags the gold for sneaking off alone in the middle of the night to follow a strange light that is obviously a willo-the-wisp. To be fair, Puck's a strong competitor for the Smug Obnoxious award, with a dash of Don't Worry Your Pretty Little Head, Just Do What I Say and I'll Protect You thrown in for flavor. Though he obviously likes Meghan (seriously, Meghan, I'm pretty sure a guy who's about to duel to the death does not ask for \"a kiss for luck\" unless he wants you to give him smoochies; if you kiss him on the cheek and he looks disappointed, the logical response here is not to wonder BUT WHY? SURELY HE DOESN'T LIKE ME IN THAT WAY?), I don't blame her for being uninterested in him romantically. Often, I'm annoyed at how the nice boy-next-door gets ditched/ignored in favor of the dashing dangerous guy, but heck, I wouldn't want to date this Puck, either. Not that I'd be so all over Ash, he of the constant hunting and the danger and the maybe wanting to kill Meghan for half the book. We get the appeal: he's a total ice-cold hottie prince. On the other hand, every paranormal romantic interest in these books is likely to be Supernaturally Gorgeous, and I, for one, am not turned on by a guy who seems to have no hobbies or interests other than violence. I'll admit that in the third part of the book, things get more interesting. Still, it's painful the way Meghan mostly fails to own the important power she has, withstanding iron. Also, she still does a lot of screaming and getting carried off. Other things Meghan does: - be forced to Labor in Low Circumstances (in the kitchens at the Summer Court) until the taskmaster awards her Grudging Respect (the book actually uses the phrase \"grudging respect\") - sneak through the villain's fortress by cornering someone and stealing his uniform Yeah . . . I don't think I'll read the sequels. Might try to find out what happens in them via other people's reviews on Goodreads, but I don't find I care too much - anyway, not enough to follow Meghan and pals any more. EDIT: After a tad more thought, would like to add one more like and one more dislike about this book. I like the concept of the iron fey. If the other fey came from and are sustained by the beliefs and dreams of humans about the supernatural, why shouldn't there be fey that come about through the beliefs and dreams of humans about technology? The whole nature-versus-technology clash would seem contrived if not for the happy fact that there are ample extant myths of fey having problems with iron. I was ticked off by how, when Grimalkin mentions to Meghan that the Nevernever is fading, her immediate reaction is, \"How can we save it?\" . . . despite the fact that her entire experience with the Nevernever (Faeryland) consists of being attacked, manipulated, bullied, tricked, hurt, and threatened with worse. She has no reflection on why she wants to save it, either - no, \"Sure, Faeryland is dangerous, but conservation blah blah\" or \"but got to save Puck blah blah\" or whatever. Nothing. (Similarly little reflection on her attraction to Ash. As another reviewer aptly noted, it's really no more examined than her crush on the dumb jock at the beginning of the book. And probably more likely to get her killed.) . . . That still counts as one dislike! \"Lack of reflection on actions and motivations.\" That's one thing! :P ...more I really wanted to like this one. I love A Midsummer Night's Dream and anything to do with faeries and/or Irish mythology, but those aspects of the plot still didn't make up for how annoying I found the characters and story as a whole.

My favorite part of it was the Machina fey. Loved the description of the computer mice that scampered around and the iron trees and acid rain. Just as cool was Mab's realm with the frost and winter scenery. Ash's powers were super cool. Well this gave me unexpected amounts of anxiety. But oh my goodness I enjoyed this sosososooooo much. It is both fun and intense. And the characters are so funny and sarcastic. And I can say that the world is very very unique.

And honestly Labyrinth was one of my favorite movies growing up and I can still quote the entire movie from start to finish, so while I can respect that it may have some influence on the author that comes out subliminally... this was just a little to close to the movie for me. I respect everyone of my friends that loved this book, gods know I have a few that most people don't like, but it wasn't for me.

Awkwardly inserted (TWSS) love triangle (this third element isn't really in this book, but you know it's coming). I will, however, give this book points for NEVER MENTIONING NEPHILIM. THANK YOU FOR THAT. Meghan Chase (and she is always referred to as such: MEGHAN CHASE, YOUR COFFEE IS READY. MEGHAN CHASE, YOU ARE STEPPING ON MY FOOT. MEGHAN CHASE, YOU HAVE CAMELTOE) lives with her mom, stepfather Luke the pig farmer (I am not making this up), and half-brother Ethan. Her dad disappeared when she was six years old. He was there, and then he just ... wasn't. Ethan has a stuffed rabbit named Floppy who tells him things. Luke barely notices her. Her best friend is her closest neighbor, a weird kid named ... Robbie Goodfell. Does the name sound familiar? It should. The book opens shortly before MEGHAN CHASE's sixteenth birthday. She's excited to tutor the cute quarterback at school for a computer science project, but when she gets there, some weird shit happens. First, the quarterback is a douchebag, and she seems to be the only person who doesn't notice. He doubts she can help him, and she is a tongue-tied IDIOT around him. For NO REASON at all. This was the moment I began to hate MEGHAN CHASE, SHE OF THE CAMELTOE. She tries to convince him that she's a computer whiz, but the computers all malfunction, scrolling, \"DOUCHEBAG QUARTERBACK IS DOUCHEBAG\" or something I can't be bothered to look up right now. But you get the gist. MEGHAN CHASE sees a tiny bug thing on the corner of one monitor, but then it's gone. Douchey Quarterback acts douchey, calls her a bitch, and storms out. You'd think that would make her realize he's, you know, a douchebag. But no, she bemoans her luck. She gets caught in the rain, and her mom shows up late to pick her up, flummoxed because the family dog has bitten Ethan. Not so, according to Ethan--he says the man in the closet tried to get him, and the dog tried to stop him (note: the man in the closet is not douchey quarterback). Nonetheless, the dog's been \"sent\" \"away.\" MEGHAN CHASE does not want to go to school on her birthday, what with the dog gone and the quarterback out to get her, but her mom promises to take her for her learner's permit right after school. And so she goes. Douchey quarterback is all chummy, asks her to meet him for lunch, and snaps a photo of the two of them. This isn't suspicious at all. Robbie begs her not to go to lunch, but MEGHAN CHASE is an idiot. The minute she meets him in the cafeteria, he texts the photo of the two of them to everyone in the school, only he's Photoshopped it so she's naked (along with the lovely riddle \"How is MEGHAN CHASE like a cold beer? She's smooth and goes down easy.\" YOU STAY CLASSY, YA!). She freaks and hides in the nurse's office. The nurse gives her an odd drink that knocks her out, but she still hears a conversation between Robbie and the nurse about how her sixteenth birthday is here, she needs to drink the mistwine, blah blah blah stupid quasi-mysterious exposition. Rob turns the bitchy cheerleader's nose into a pig snout. Yes, go for the girl, not the douchebag who did the Photoshopping, but whatever. When she gets home, her mom is lying in a pool of blood, having slipped in a puddle of vegetable oil. Ethan is acting weird, and when Robbie finally shows up, Ethan's gnawing on MEGHAN CHASE's legs. Because the real Ethan has been kidnapped and switched with a changeling. And oh yeah, Robbie Goodfell? Is Robin Goodfellow, i.e. Puck. So faeries are real, Ethan's kidnapped, and MEGHAN CHASE has a MEGHAN CHOICE: drink a bunch of this mistwine and forget everything that's happened, or go with Puck into the faerielands (the Nevernever). She chooses the Labyrinth path: to save her half-brother from David Bowie whoever has kidnapped him. Into the Nevernever! Okay, pop quiz: you just find out faeries are real, and that your BFF from childhood is actually the very same Puck from Midsummer Night's Dream . You are in the land of Faerie. What do you do? Do you trust your instincts, or do you maybe LISTEN TO PUCK? Alas, MEGHAN CHASE fails at life. She questions everything Puck does and can't keep it fucking straight that you do not speak unguarded to faeries, who take everything more literally than Amelia Bedelia. You do not say, \"i'LL PROMISE YOU ANYTHING IF YOU'LL HELP ME!\" But of course MEGHAN CHASE does. She gets nearly eaten and/or enslaved several times before we even get to the Seelie Court (Puck is from the Seelie Court and suspects Ethan has been taken by the Unseelie Court). This cat-like faerie thing named Grimalkin helps her get to the Seelie Court. And then, SURPRISE! It turns out MEGHAN CHASE is Oberon's bastard daughter. It was around this time that I audibly said, \"WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT? OH, COME THE FUCK ON.\" But I forged ahead. Oberon's none too pleased with Puck's return to the Nevernever without his permission, and for leaving MEGHAN CHASE alone, so he's changed him into a bird and put him in a cage. By the by, if Oberon's my dad, and he says no mortal clothes at the dinner table? I'm going to wear the pretty gossamer faerie dust magic gown on the bed, not my moldy nasty t-shirt and jeans. Oh, MEGHAN CHASE, the author may be trying to make you plucky and brave, but you just come off as petulant and moronic. Also, if you have ever read anything faerie-related, you'll already know faeries can't touch iron. But MEGHAN CHASE can, despite her royal faerie blood. Because she can touch her iPod! (Is there any iron in those? Aren't they all steel and aluminum?) There's a lot more MEGHAN CHASE stupidity, wherein she pisses off everyone and gets banished to hard labor in the kitchens by Titania, then rescued again by Oberon in time for Elysium, which is like the G8 summit of the faerie world. She meets the Unseelie Court, Queen Mab and everyone else, including her son Ash, who just happens to be this guy on a horse she saw from the school bus on her birthday and also outside the Seelie Court lands, when she got hunted like a DOG. But oh! He's, like, hot! And dangerous! And so arrogant! And smirky! You can see where this is going to go. But before we can GO THERE, ZOMG CHIMERA ATTACK! In the middle of the Faerie8! Chimera eats everything! Chimera don't care! He slaps the shit out of it! But he is defeated by cooperation of Seelie and Unseelie courts working together. MEGHAN CHASE sees this little metallic bug thing crawl away from Chimera carcass. Of course, each court blames the attack on the other, and war is about to break out. Grim the magic cat urges MEGHAN CHASE to leave if she wants to find her brother, and she does, and they swing by Detroit on the way to the Unseelie court, pissing off a club owner and nearly getting eaten again, but TA DAAAA, Puck shows up and saves the day. They head to Unseelie court, and DUN DUN DUN, *Ash* [insert sparkly eye batting and butterflies and fluttery hearts here] is waiting for them. He and Puck fight for a while--they've vowed to fight to the death based on something from the past [hint: Puck was reckless and got the love of Ash's life KILLT!]. They're so busy fighting that they don't notice MEGHAN CHASE carried off by little metal gremlins or some shit, and here is where we get to my favorite character in the book, IRONHORSE. He is a horse made of iron. Crazy, yeah? HE SPEAKS IN ALL CAPS AND ALWAYS USES MEGHAN CHASE'S FULL NAME AND GIVES VERY LOUD, METALLIC INSTRUCTIONS WHICH IS WHY THE ALL CAPS ARE NECESSARY. IRONHORSE SAYS THE IRON KING HAS HER BROTHER AND SHE MUST GO WITH IRONHORSE TO THE IRON KING, MEGHAN CHASE. MEGHAN CHASE escapes again through the help of *dreamy Ash* and Puck. MEGHAN CHASE makes a bargain with *Ash* that if he helps her get to the Iron King, she'll then go with him back to Queen Mab's court. First they need to see the Oracle, who is, naturally, in New Orleans. Oracle wants something in return for information about Iron King, and she agrees on the price of MEGHAN CHASE's happiest memory. Guess which one she takes? Basically, ALL KNOWLEDGE OF HER FATHER (you know, the one who disappeared on her sixth birthday, and who, it has been hinted, may still be alive somewhere in Nevernever). They have to go back to a park, but then VIRUS, another of the Iron King's henchmen, turns a crowd of humans into zombies with more of those tiny bug things that made Chimera not give a shit. SEE, BECAUSE HUMANS ARE SO TIED TO TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE GOING TO DESTROY OURSELVES AND EVERYTHING WE LOVE AND LEAVE OURSELVES VULNERABLE FOR HOSTILE MIND TAKEOVER. *anvils* *the irony, no pun intended, is not lost on me that anvils are made of iron(y)* Puck gets shot, and that's no good on account of the IRON(y), but a bunch of dryads take Puck into the bark of a tree to heal him. The heart of a tree, the witchwood, is the only tool that can destroy the Iron King. But taking the witchwood will make the spirit in the tree die. MEGHAN CHASE does not want to kill anyone! But the Dryad is like, \"Bitch, please, I'm old, and I'm going to die anyway because the technology and Iron King and stuff are killing me and my kind, so motherfucking let my death mean something, you stupid fuck.\" Umm, Puck's out for the rest of the book, convalescing inside the tree. So *Ash* and MEGHAN CHASE return to the Nevernever. The air is thick with iron(y), which is destroying *Ash*. Fights and chases, Tiring. Stupidity. Danger. Out of NOWHERE, *Ash* and MEGHAN CHASE are kissing. LIke, oookayy, that's really believable. Thanks. Meh, they get taken prisoner again in the RETURN OF IRONHORSE [clapping hands! I mean, clopping hoofs!]. My favorite is when he says, \"NO FUNNY BUSINESS FROM YOU, PRINCESS.\" Iron faerie henchmen always talk like schoolyard hooligans from the 1930s! \"I WILL PUT UP WITH NO SHENANIGANS, MEGHAN CHASE. AND YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT TRAIPSING OR CAVORTING OR GALLIVANTING, YOUNG MISS. ALSO HAVE YOU TRIED THE REUBEN AT THE DELI DOWN THE WAY BECAUSE IT IS BEYOND.\" Fighty fight, *Ash* is weakening, stuff, everyone's a prisoner, gnome-y gremlin things help them escape because MEGHAN CHASE gave them her now dead iPod, more fighty fighting, *Ash* looks dead, MEGHAN CHASE is taken by the gnome-y gremlin things to the former Iron King, who got dethroned by the current Iron King. Blah blah, the fighting gets monotonous, gnomey things find and return the special witchwood arrow that IRONHORSE tossed away when MEGHAN CHASE and *Ash* were first (re)captured, there's a smelly dwarf in armor, *Ash* still alive, but IT'S A TRAP, Iron King proposes because he wants MEGHAN CHASE with her magical faerie powers and iron-holding abilities to help DESTROY ALL NON-IRON-FAERYDOM, but she's all Donna Martin \"I choose me,\" then MEGHAN CHASE calls upon her DORMANT POWER of pulling up trees and roots n' shit with her motherfucking MIND, saves her brother, and defeats the Iron King by stabbing him through with the witchwood arrow. Blah blah. Stuff. Back home, she's been missing for three months--everyone thought she'd run away for good. Girl with pig snout is much nicer because now she has a pig snout. Tedious homecoming scene, tying things up neatly except OH NO MEGHAN CHASE FORGOT ABOUT HER EARTH-DADDY. Also, her mom's like, oops, I should have told you a long time ago how I got busy with Oberon, but I was hoping it was a dream. MEGHAN CHASE is like, \"Okay, cool, whatever.\" MEGHAN CHASE is about to settle in for the night when *Ash* shows up, all healed, ready to take her to Queen Mab, now that he's kept his half of the bargain. So off they go, leaving everyone else behind, and OMG did I really read this shite? I believe I did. There's a second book, which I'll probably read because I am a masochist. I can almost guarantee that there will be Puck jealousy over the TWUE WUV of *Ash* and MEGHAN CHASE, and a lot more stupidity. The best characters in the book were Ethan, Grim, and Floppy, the decapitated, stuffed bunny. Maybe Kagawa should stick to those. Also, when *Ash* finally tells MEGHAN CHASE why he and Puck hate each other, and he talks about the love of his life, As soon as he mentions this dead faerie's name, MEGHAN CHASE narrates, \"I felt the breath sucked out of me. His lady. Ash had been involved, once.\" OMFG REALLY. THAT'S HOW YOU WORD THIS. HE'S A MOTHERFUCKING FAERIE WHO IS MILLENNIA OLD. You're jealous because he was \"involved\"? You know what is also unbelievable? Is for this magical faerie prince guy to be all, \"Had I known I'd meet you , MEGHAN CHASE, I wouldn't have vowed to kill Puck for having a part in the demise of my Lady Love.\" ETA: Another complaint--what is up with the tense changes? When Kagawa switches MEGHAN CHASE's voice to present tense, it takes away the uncertainty. If she's speaking in a present, then she must have made it through the past she is relating. And yeah, I get that it's a YA book and will most likely have a happy ending, but, oy, way to take me out of the moment, Kagawa. To sum up: this book is stupid. I'm going to write entire stories in IRONHORSE's voice, because he cracks me the fuck up. If you want a good faerie book, go read Maggie Stiefvater 's Lament: The Faerie Queen's Deception instead. ...more This is not my first read of fae, though it's not like I've read tons of books about fairies.

Come on, admit it, even if you're not proud of it, that's what you see when you think of a 'fairy'. For starters, this definitely isn't about fairies like Tinkerbell running around scattering fairydust in the winds.. To be honest, fairies are more like Legolas, pointed ears and all. They are magical creatures, living in a world built within ours, portals & all that. By 'magical' I mean they have magic, they can magic your ass into next year. There is the Seelie Court (consider it the good guys, though it's not it by far) and there is the Unseelie Court (the supposedly bad ones). I'm just going to say that they're all the same, the only difference is that those from the Seelie Court live in summer while those from the Unseelie Court live in a state of constant winter. All of the fairies are kind of bound by their word, if they say something they're going to have to stand by it no matter who you are, wife, kid or their grandma. So, beware of who you make promises to. Meghan Chase is 15 and her birthday is coming up. She's one of those kids that lives far away from school, in a secluded area where the nearest house is 2 miles away. That house happens to be that of her best fried, Robbie. What she doesn't know is that she's a daughter of a fairy. Her brother is kidnapped & she is forced to learn about the world of Fey & travel there & begin an amazing journey, full of danger, exhilarating action, evil kings & queens. This is the part where I say how much I love Robin Goodfellow Puck. He's the one that makes this series, he's funny & he's constantly by Meghan's side trying to protect her & do what's right. He's the epitome of the perfect character. Then there's Meghan, she's pretty amazing, smart-mouthed, brave & not afriad to stand up for & protect her friends & her loved-ones. There's Ash, he's a prince of the Unseelie Court, he's amazing, he mostly is stoic & he seems cold but underneath all that he's warm & fuzzy. \u201cOh, we're playing nice now?
