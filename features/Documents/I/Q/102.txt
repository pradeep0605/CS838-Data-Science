It was one one of the books that you just look back and see how much a character has grown, how much she has learnt. Her giving up Dimitri and saying she wants him to be happy was very touching that I just cried. Rose at book 1 was really looking for trouble. She was a risk-taker, and she pretty much broke the rules. In book 2, Rose was selfish, and she sort of used Mason. In the end, she decided that she didn't love him, and realized doing that was only going to hurt them more. She realized that love could not be forced. -Which pretty much said that she understood what love is, showing her growth from book 1. Ironically, Rose was the one who scolded her classmates for breaking the rules, while on book 1, she broke the rules herself. She was a very quick learner, and she understood that she couldn't take on the Strigoi easily, not like she has previously assumed. In the end, she killed two. What I love about Vampire Academy books is that they are deep. It shows a person a lot: how you could find the strength in weakness, courage in fear, surviving in suffering, love from misunderstanding, and truth in lies. ...more ____________________________________________ \u201cThere's nothing worse than waiting and not knowing what'll happen to you.

As I said,I quite liked the first one,not as much as everybody out there,but it was interesting and I started to like vampires as creatures.This is,however,was as enjoyable as the first.It was not better for me.There is some character development here,maybe more than in the first,and the story of this one was clearly more interesting,but...I still don't think Rose is an ideal main character.It's just that she is really annoying at times,and all the thinks about is sex and boys and this stuff.I like it when author show flaws at character,but with Rose is kind of getting overused.Comparing her to other heroines like Celaena from Throne of Glass or June from Legend or Tessa from The Infernal Devices,let's be honest,she is zero.I liked the new characters,or the old characters but with new habits like Mia.And the scene with water in the end was awesome. ____________________________________________ \u201cwhat's your name?\" what?\" i asked, squinting at the light. your name.\" I reconized Dr. Olendzki peering over me. you know my name.\" I want you to tell me.\" Rose.

While the adults argue, some of the students sneak away to deal with the threat themselves. The thought process of Rose is easy to be sympathetic with and believable. The characters are great and very individual to themselves. I continue to enjoy the vampire hierarchy in this book, combined with the differences of Strigoi, vdampir, and Moroi. **Mild Spoiler**: There is one character death that was sad to witness but Rose's reaction to it was very well written. I am excited to continue with this series. It has definitely exceeded expectations. ...more The first book in this series left me feeling a big Meh.

It\u2019s also dealt with differently and in a more realistic way \u2013 which is in direct ascension with the growth of the main character, Rose. She did grow up a little in this book, though only slightly. She remains a unique, alluring and interesting narrator, even if she is painfully slow to catch on to the things going on around her. I swear I knew everything that was going to happen long before she did and I literally felt like screaming at her to put two and two together and FIGURE IT THE HELL OUT! I felt the romance between her and Dimitri was MARKEDLY improved. It was realistic, more heartfelt and real. He manages to avert the otherwise extreme squickiness of a twenty-four and seventeen year old in a romance by behaving and acting mostly appropriately despite the impulses. The mother in me wants to scold him for not working harder, the young woman in me is begging him to go for it. The story in this instance, and the plot, is much improved. It\u2019s far more gripping, intense and pushes the reader into a shared sense of dread and elation toward the end. Over all I thought it was a much better read. ...more 4.5 stars Holy shit that was a roller coaster ride Oh dear... I seem to be ever so slightly... hooked . How did this happen?

I loved loved loved the relationship between Rose and her mother in this novel. The similarities between them that they are both too stubborn to see and the wonderful mutual understanding between them at the end. Also, Dimitri was so much better in this book. I thought he was a bit of a douche in the last one but I'm now starting to see the attraction - just wish he would have dropped his moral values earlier on, hehe. On that subject, I really do love how <---A>Richelle Mead</---A> manages to make a young adult novel incredibly steamy with lots of hot make-out sessions and dirty thoughts. Young adult romantic relationships are often so tame but not here :) By the way, Rose is now officially one of my favourite heroines ever. She kicks ass and gets it on with hot men - woo!

They could get together but never have children. It's just weird. I highly doubt they will be together at the end. ...more The blurb says: Mason would die to be with Rose... Well that's just silly. If you die to be with someone, you wouldn't be able to be with them, cause you'd be dead! Plus, like everything else in this book, that's such a melodramatic statement. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out what the big deal over this series is.

I read the first one, was indifferent to it, and then I heard about this series everywhere. It was a series that got better as it went along. There was character development. The heroine was multi-dimensional. Good, strong romance. Interesting characters. So, after a year, I picked up the second one to see if I had missed something and ... eh. On one hand, I do see some positives, like the vampire lore. Most paranormal teen books are painfully simplistic, and I\u2019m glad to say this book does have some world building going on here. I know nothing of vampires, so when I was researching fictional creatures and came across the types of vampires that were in these books, I was quite impressed. Using real mythology to work in your story and giving your own twist on it in a modern setting? Not bad, Mead. If I\u2019m being painfully honest, I thought she just made those words (Strigoi/Dhampir etc) up completely. But hey, come on, some authors don\u2019t even know what happens to vampires when they walk into the sun, not naming any names. And .... that\u2019s pretty much what I liked. I have to laugh when I hear the characters of Vampire Academy being called complex or \u201cdeep\u201d \u2013 I mean really. Come on. I get what the attraction to Rose is \u2013 big mouthed, outgoing, snarky \u2013 the exact opposite of the whiny dish mop YA heroines we\u2019re used to, amirite? No, let\u2019s instead make her ANOTHER stereotype and now she\u2019s oh-so-original! Don\u2019t actually bother to make her a three dimensional character, that would be SO MUCH WORK. Just make her the exact opposite of the dish mop heroine, and teens will totally fall for it because she\u2019s so speshul and different \u2013 except they DO fall for it! URGH. Rose is just so exaggerated I don\u2019t even really hate her; there\u2019s not enough of her to feel much of anything for. She\u2019s just too obnoxious, too loud, too self-absorbed to really be taken seriously. And to top it off, she\u2019s kind of an idiot. This girl is some kind of guardian for a PRINCESS and she\u2019s about as slow as a heard of turtles racing through peanut butter. Mead has a hard time planning surprises well, because nothing comes off nearly as shocking as it is intended because any semi-discerning reader is smarter than Rose. The secondary characters are all right I guess \u2013 I like the witty remarks and all, although none of them make me laugh out loud. Still, it\u2019s nice to have a group of teenagers speaking like teenagers for a change without quoting Latin and Shakespeare. Except Dmitri, who\u2019s about as fun as watching \u201cThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button\u201d without a bathroom break. Speaking of which, this series is soooo predictable. Can someone please tell me why all teen authors do this? I wouldn\u2019t mind a love triangle, I really wouldn\u2019t, if there was actually a point or at the very least a surprise along the way. If we have three interesting, complex characters, and you like all three of them, then a love triangle can make you ache for them. If you have a hard time choosing between the two boys (or girls, I suppose, but you never see a girl-boy-girl love triangle) then that\u2019s a sign you did it RIGHT. If you don\u2019t know who the girl is going to pick because both boys are so awesome and she sincerely loves them both, then you\u2019re doing it right. WHY DOES NO AUTHOR EVEN ATTEMPT TO DO THIS? Answer: because that would actually require some tough decision making. How do YA authors REALLY write love triangles? You\u2019ve got the main girl, the soul mate, and the poor other guy who you know is going to either end up miserable and alone, dead, or hooking up with some secondary character you barely even remember the name of by the end. I haven\u2019t even read the rest of the series and I don\u2019t have to \u2013 I KNOW Rose will end up with Dmitri. I know it the way I knew Bella would end up with Edward, Clary would end up with Jace, Ever would end up with Damen, Luce would end up with Daniel, Tessa with Will (view spoiler) [ Having finished The Infernal Devices, I'm eating my words on this one and saying the love triangle was actually fantastically done. However, I still firmly, wholeheartedly believe that if Tessa had been forced to woman up and CHOOSE one (misunderstandings and wedding engagements aside), she would have chosen Will. (hide spoiler) ] , Donna with Xan ... just a few off the top of my head (some of these series aren\u2019t done and I have no intention on reading them, but trust me, I KNOW \u2013 I HAVE NEVER BEEN WRONG YET). Even the Hunger Games, which on most days I think is a good series, was painfully obvious with the love triangle \u2013 did Gale ever really have a chance? The author can never help but hinting at who her favourite is, and when you know who the favourite is, you\u2019ve got who the girl will end up with. When you know who ends up together, it\u2019s boring. It makes the angst pointless and annoying to read because you know everything is going to end up alright. She\u2019ll end up with the lame, mysterious, brooding guy, because she always does. Screw the guy with a personality and sense of humour. (Sidenote: Have you noticed the readers always seem to like the underdog guy? I wonder why that is. Maybe the author is so busy trying to make everyone love the brooding guy, and she isn\u2019t trying to make the other guy swoon-worthy, that his personality comes out easier. Because Brooding Guy never seems to have a personality.) The writing is terrible by the way. I know, I know, it\u2019s written in the narration of a rather dimwitted teenage girl, but it\u2019s still irritating. The prologue, explaining the story so far was so corny I was grimacing the whole way through. It gets a bit better after that but everything is explained \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 through Rose, so naturally, it\u2019s all telling, no showing, explaining the most obvious things, the vocabulary never extending past that of a sixth grader and ruining sentimental moments with cheesy, misplaced comments only a stupid teenage girl would say. Look, it\u2019s not the worst book in the world (silly, \u201cMarked\u201d is!) but I can\u2019t slog through what, four more of these? I know what\u2019s going to happen in the end, so I don\u2019t see much of a point in going through hackneyed, predictable trials of these bland characters when I KNOW. Will Rose and her mother reconnect? Will Rose's father be revealed? Will Lissa end up a powerful royal? Which boy will Rose end up with? Will good conquer over darkness? Gee, I have NO FRIGGIN IDEA. ...more Oh... my... God! Holy...I am freaking out! This is the second installment in the Vampire Academy series. Are you kidding me?! This book looks like the last book in the series! Gosh, what will happen in the other four books? I loved this book, it was so entertaining and amazing. Might have spoilers: Rose has become sightly an adult and now she realizes her mistakes and her relationships with many people increased.

Might have spoilers: Rose has become sightly an adult and now she realizes her mistakes and her relationships with many people increased. I always liked Rose because she is a strong kick-ass heroine and can handle anything. Well, she has to. I loved her in this book like hell. I loved how she hooked up with Mason in the beginning, Oh man...I don't want to cry, fuck! , and Dimitri in the end. Mason, :'( why? WHY? I always loved you! You were awesome! You didn't have to die! Because of you, I freaking cried while reading the rest of the book, and I am still crying because, GOSH! I loved you. While Fighting: Get out!\" Rose screamed. He was still in the sun, still safe. ME: Get out! Please! But he didn't listen to me. He ran toward us, out of his protective light. I redoubled my struggles, hoping I'd pull Isaiah's attention away from Mason. I didn't. Isaiah shoved me into Elena before Mason was halfway to us. Swiftly, Isaiah blocked and seized hold of Mason, exactly as he'd done to me earlier. ME: NOOOOOOOOO! *Horror struck!* Only, unlike with me, Isaiah didn't restrain Mason's arms. He didn't jerk Mason upright by the hair or make long, rambling threats about an agonizing death. Isaiah simply stopped the attack, grabbed Mason's head with both hands, and gave a quick twist. There was a sickening crack. Mason's eyes went wide. Then they went blank. ME: What? WHAT? Fuck! NO! :'( He hurt his ankle skiing, went to kill Strigoi, got kidnapped By Strigoi, got killed trying to save Rose Hathaway. RIP Mason. I will always remember you. Moving on, Lissa wasn't in this story at all, which was okay because I don't like her at all. Even if shes calm and peaceful and wonderful, I still love Rose. Christian is much better then Lissa. I really like him. Atleast he can fight! =D Dimitri, WTF?! It was all your fault! If you had declined being a guardian for Tasha in the beginning, Rose wouldn't have gone for Mason and then Mason wouldn't have known about the secret, And you told her, even when you knew she has a freaking open mouth, then Mason would have never sacrificed for Rose. And in the end, you kissed her and said, \"I am back?\"......All I could say is... Go die in hell! >.< *I called Dimitri something that would have earned me a detention back at school.* I felt like the second installment was better from the first since because unlike the first one, the story is less like Gossip Girl and more about surviving in this world and well the plot kind of improved in my opinion. The Rose I knew at Vampire Academy (book 1) kept having troubles. She was a risk-taker, and she pretty much broke the rules. In this book, She started liking Mason. But In the end, because of Dimitri (hate him like hell), she decided that she didn't love him, and realized doing that was only going to hurt them more. She realized that love could not be forced. She understood what love is. We also meet a new Character Adrian, who is like Lissa, Spirit thingy and all. This is a satisfying sequel and I would love to read the next book. Overall, I loved this book. Kept reading this book non-stop and I will give this book, 4.5/5 stars :D ...more My review of Vampire Academy. If you\u2019ve been following my reviews for a while you probably would have noticed that I rarely reread books. I\u2019m not the fastest reader so I\u2019d usually rather read new books than reread ones that I\u2019ve already experienced. However, with the Vampire Academy novels I had no trouble rereading the first two books because they\u2019re just so addicting that you can\u2019t help but fly through them even if you don\u2019t have much time.

What I Liked: \u27a8 More Dimitri! Yay! You can never go wrong with more Dmitri. I ship him with Rose so hard, you guys have no idea. I feel like their relationship started getting a little more serious in this book, even though they both know that they shouldn\u2019t be together aghh. There\u2019s something about forbidden love that makes me go all sorts of mushy \u27a8 Adrian : We get to meet Adrian in this book and I\u2019m assuming that he\u2019s going to play a major role in the next books because he seems to be everyone\u2019s favorite character for some reason that I can\u2019t wait to find out. I\u2019m still team Dimitri though (for now) but hey anything could happen. \u27a8 The humor : The humor in these books is just on point. The jokes and smart ass replies crack me up so bad every single time haha What I didn\u2019t like : \u27a8 Stupid Characters : There were a few situations where the characters were facing a problem and the solution was just right there under their noses and they kept acting like it wasn\u2019t obvious at all. I just wanted to smack them on the head with the book. Overall, it was a very good sequel to the series. I\u2019m going to jump right into the third one which I haven\u2019t read before so it should be interesting :D Thanks for reading. Share your thoughts. ...more This is a satisfying sequel, because the thing is, Richelle Mead could have gone very obvious with Rose. It would have been easy street, and would have probably still worked, as Rose threw in a quip here and there, kicked some ass, got in trouble, got saved, learned her lesson and then got the boy. Bada Bing. Bada Boom. And while Rose may do all those things, she does them in her own way and her own time and becomes a fully fleshed girl whose mistakes you might cringe at but you understand.

Bada Bing. Bada Boom. And while Rose may do all those things, she does them in her own way and her own time and becomes a fully fleshed girl whose mistakes you might cringe at but you understand. That's Rose. So watching her grow, learn and change is an absolute pleasure. Everything about her you believe, whether she drives you crazy or not, you believe because she becomes that real to you. That being said, this is another great entry to the Vampire Academy world. Lissa and Christian's relationship is another thing I love about the series, seeing two social opposites navigate a relationship. Christian Ozera is an outsider to the Royal Moroi world even though his last name sits amongst the ranks. In this story we get to see that Christian is just as much of a hero as his dhampir counterparts, and that he can hold his own on the smartass train. Speaking of said train, this is the book where we meet Adrian Ivashkov. Standing amongst a cloud of clove smoke with a charmer's grin, Adrian brings the devil-may-care attitude to this group of teenagers that have had to grow up way too fast. Adrian pulls out all the stops with his Rose flirtations, seeing things brewing between the characters that the others can't, which adds a bit of mystery to who exactly this guy with the perfectly mussed hair is and what exactly he's going to bring to the party. Because, without a doubt, if Adrian is around there is a party not too far behind him. Then there's my Dimitri Belikov. Who apparently also goes by Dimka. Stop stealing our heart already. Okay, i'm lying, don't you ever stop. After the end of Vampire Academy we know the feelings Dimitri is battling when it comes to Rose, which makes their interactions that much more intense and delicious. Tasha Ozera, Christian's bold aunt, is now also on the playing field as a Strigoi attack brings everyone together at a ski resort for the winter holiday, inviting a whole host of characters into the academy world. Like an unexpected family member that is going to bring the fight right out of Rose. The stakes (excuse the pun) are even higher in this go 'round, because this fight is even more lethal than anything Victor Dashkov gave. Rose and her friends working together against a common creepy-as-hell enemy gives us our first glimpse into what these kids can do and what they've learned from the academy. Christian will surprise you. Mason will break your heart. Dimitri will steal it. Other characters will shock you, but it's fierce and it's awesome and will give you a paper cut if you're not careful. ...more A lot of people don't like this Vampire Academy book as much, but it's one of my favorites. There are breath-taking battle sequences at the end, and a devastating aftermath that leaves Rose forever changed. My respect for her grew leaps and bounds in this book, and the series really kicked into high gear both in story and in emotion. 5/5 I didn't think that this series could get any better than the first one but I was wrong. I really enjoyed reading this book and can't wait for the next one. There was action but that wasn't my main reason for liking Frostbite. Rose was changing so much during the book. One way was her relationship with her mom.

Rose and Dimitri was another favorite part of this book. Why couldn't they just get together? I liked him in the second book better than the first which was surprising but I'm very glad about that. I just wish that he would have that realization at the beginning of the book. Richelle Mead really does know how to write a good YA book that is so different yet better than others in this genre. There were also some sadder parts. Frostbite seemed to be more serious than the first one which was different but I did like it. The ending was amazing and the sad parts just made it better. Rose Hathaway might be my favorite YA heroine and in this book, she got even more brave and powerful. Overall, everything in this book was better. I hope that this trend will continue in the next book. ...more Rating: 3/5 Finally, the first review I write for 2015 and it's going to be more of a rant...

But unfortunately the things that mildly bothered me in the first book were very annoying in this one. My main problem is Rose. She is such a vengeful, pitiful and immature person that is really hard for me to feel for her. She keeps complaining about Lisa not having time for her now that she has a boyfriend, but I am pretty sure she would do the exact same thing if their roles were reversed. Also she keeps saying and doing mean and hurtful things being fully conscious of her actions, which is something unforgivable for me. Also, Lissa was another person whose behavior was bothering me throughout the whole book. She is one of those people who once they get a boyfriend they pretty much don't have time for anyone else and I don't like those people at all. But even with all its problems, I really enjoy the world Richelle Mead created. And the story is moving along very nicely, taking a very interesting turn. I really want to know what will happen next. But the possibility of me dropping this series will increase if Rose keeps being annoying. ...more (Finally made a review) Frostbite was such a fantastic read! In this book, I got to know more of Rose and her life in the Vampire Academy. There were lots of exciting events that happened, including their adventure trip to Idaho wherein the students and the guardians intended to escape Strigoi threats. And of course, it was nice to finally meet the infamous Adrian Ivashkov. Fancy meeting this hot dude because indeed, he\u2019s one swoony guy! I totally love his character.

And of course, it was nice to finally meet the infamous Adrian Ivashkov. Fancy meeting this hot dude because indeed, he\u2019s one swoony guy! I totally love his character. He reminds me so much of Daemon Black. Well anyway, what totally made me admire this book is that it\u2019s way better compared to the first one. It has a nice plot and Rose was getting more doses of badassery\u2014the kickass kind of badassery that is funny and amusing. And of course, I love Dimitri more in this book. Love the way he shows Rose how mature he is when it comes to keeping his emotions in full control and when it comes to making decisions. My favorite part of this book was the epic combat between Rose and her mom. Whoa! I\u2019ve never been so fully entertained all my life! I just love that funny mother-daughter moment so much. All in all, the book is great. It totally led me to read its next, Shadow Kiss. Rating: 5 Stars ...more Oh. My. Goodness. Rose Hathaway is back, and she\u2019s the reason we have the word BADASS. Frostbite, the second instalment in the Vampire Academy series, is rather obvious evidence that there is a real reason this series is so colossally popular. I honestly don\u2019t know why it took me so damn long to read Vampire Academy... and then waited months before reading Frostbite. After (finally) reading it, I\u2019m sold... but where do I start?

I honestly don\u2019t know why it took me so damn long to read Vampire Academy... and then waited months before reading Frostbite. After (finally) reading it, I\u2019m sold... but where do I start? The amazing BFF relationship? Unique, fascinating mythology? The swoon-worthy-doesn\u2019t-even-cut-it Dimitri? Hmmm... how about kickass, smart-mouthed, FREAKING VAMPIRE SLAYER, Rose. A Rose By Any Other Name... For me, one of the coolest things about Vampire Academy\u2014and really, this applies to the entire cast of characters\u2014is the authenticity of Rose. Her voice, her actions, her myriad of imperfections. I love that these characters feel like real teenagers, without being whiny or weak impersonations. What this series doesn\u2019t have is stereotypes. Every character is real, fleshed out, with good and bad, light and dark. Even the most snotty, hateful of characters aren\u2019t maniacally chuckling villains. But ROSE. She\u2019s tough, gutsy, and fiercely loyal. I love the relationship she shares with her best friend, Lissa. She cares and she believes in her convictions. She\u2019s smoking-hot-drop-dead-gorgeous\u2014and knows it\u2014and an outrageous flirt, which is enormously fun, but I think what I love most is her impulsivity and recklessness. She acts first, thinks later. She\u2019s gotten better than she was in Vampire Academy\u2014she\u2019s grown and developed\u2014but, rather than this making her a bit \u2018too stupid to live\u2019, it makes her unpredictable, and fun to follow. Politics Come Out To Play Frostbite really ups the political game, and I get the impression it will continue in this direction even more as the series progresses. The question of the sustainability of a society (and, well, species) completely reliant on minority group they treat as inferior, while allowing themselves to become more and more physically weak and defenceless is raised, and there are some really ugly questions asked about just how far the wealthy and privileged will go to maintain their lifestyle and feel safe. It really seems like the privileged Moroi Royals look down on their Dhampir Guardians as being sub-human, and I mean, guys, come on, how long do you think they\u2019ll let that go on for? Who actually holds the power here? If I\u2019m Honest, The Real Reason I\u2019m Reading... Dimitri... *sighs* The tension between Rose and Dimitri in Frostbite is palpable. My chest ached every time the two shared a page... but something else showed up in Frostbite that caught my attention. Something interesting. SOMEONE. The infamous Adrian Ivashkov. Um, so, in the past, I\u2019ve complained\u2014heartily, loudly, and... well, at times, constantly\u2014about love triangles (dirty words! dirty words!). And don\u2019t get me wrong, because I can see where this is going, but I like Adrian. And I like Dimitri. This would be the first book I\u2019ve ever read where I like both potential suitors, and it\u2019s not an obvious choice... I mean, other than Dimitri :P The Verdict Frostbite left me with a tonne of unanswered questions. While Vampire Academy (being a first book) worked as a standalone, Frostbite feels a lot more like a series instalment, but this is not a criticism. It gave me a fabulous sense of more fabulous\u2014and terrifying\u2014things to come. Progress has been made, new dangers and questions have arisen, and some unresolved issues from VA have been poked and prodded, and danced around. Mead ends it on a note artfully balanced between leaving me rabidly demanding resolution and a sense of satisfaction at the story\u2019s conclusion. Evil, evil, EVIL WOMAN. Frosbite is exciting, gripping, fun, and heartbreaking. Vampire Academy took me by surprise, and Richelle Mead has upped the game again. A fantastic follow-up and addition to the series! Review originally posted at saz101 \u00bb ...more I like this story alright, but can we just all admit that we would be shaking in our boots if we had to depend upon Rose to save our lives? For a girl who has been training her entire life to be a vampire body guard, she is ridiculously immature. I get that she's 17, but she has been indoctrinated into this lifestyle since she was barely out of diapers. She should have dealt with her impulse-control issues by the age of 12. She should have learned about killing Strigoi much sooner. After all, th I like this story alright, but can we just all admit that we would be shaking in our boots if we had to depend upon Rose to save our lives?

I get that she's 17, but she has been indoctrinated into this lifestyle since she was barely out of diapers. She should have dealt with her impulse-control issues by the age of 12. She should have learned about killing Strigoi much sooner. After all, they graduate and get their assignments at 18. Shouldn't they have been practicing how to kill these monsters earlier than 6 months before graduation? Seems to me that since that is their primary job, maybe a little more practice would help. It also seems to me that it would be helpful to know where the heart is in a human body. You know, since that's the only place that you can stab them and have them actually die. Kinda important. \"Where's the heart?\" I gave him an are-you-serious look...With over dramatic emphasis, I pointed to the left side of the dummy's chest. Dimitri shook his head. \"That's not where the heart is,\" he told me. \"Sure it is. People put their hands over their hearts when they say the Pledge of Allegiance or sing the national anthem.\" But wait - maybe I am blaming the wrong person. If Rose, who's just a couple of months away from having a job that makes it life-threateningly important to know the location of a human's heart, is ignorant of this information, is it really her fault? I mean, if you get these young children in school, and you know that you will train them for their whole life on how to kill Strigoi, wouldn't you start teaching them where the heart is starting in kindergarten? So, really, it's the school that sucks in this book. Now, I get it. ...more I randomly decided to re-read Vampire Academy and Bloodlines because I'm going through a lot of bad reading slumps, and these books have always helped with that. I do plan on doing actual series reviews for them but for now, as I finish each book, I'm going to do spoiler-ish rambles on each one specifically: (view spoiler) [- The recaps are annoying. I skipped the first part before chapter 1 (I think that part is great - you can skip it or if it's been a while read it for a refresh) but the parts I randomly decided to re-read Vampire Academy and Bloodlines because I'm going through a lot of bad reading slumps, and these books have always helped with that. I do plan on doing actual series reviews for them but for now, as I finish each book, I'm going to do spoiler-ish rambles on each one specifically: (view spoiler) [- The recaps are annoying. I skipped the first part before chapter 1 (I think that part is great - you can skip it or if it's been a while read it for a refresh) but the parts actually included in the story itself feel too long and unnecessary. I literally just read that in the last book... I bet it's great if you're not in that situation though and need a reminder. - \"He greeted me by way of a nod. Considering the antagonism that sometimes flared up between us, that was almost on par with him giving me a bear hug.\" I love Rose and Christian's dynamic. - Awww Mason. I wish we'd gotten to see more of you. His recklessness irritated me and was asking for trouble, but I felt so bad for him re. Rose and I wish that we could have gotten more from his character beyond that. I repeat: I wanted more of the Mason and Eddie bromance. - It's nice to see you again, Adrian, but wow Frostbite Adrian is a far cry from The Ruby Circle Adrian. He's... a bit much. I do love his charm and all that, but I definitely appreciate his character more when we learn more about him (and spirit, his family, Jill, Rose, Sydney, etc.) rather than him being that very typical flirty sarcastic rich type. It's kind of obvious that Richelle Mead didn't intend for his character to go much further but I'll always love her for expanding on his role more and making him become more than what he seems with this first glance. Oh and he's hot. I rarely find myself interested in characters like that but *shrugs* there's a few exceptions. - ARGH VAMPIRE ATTACK. WE ARE THREATENED. LET US TAKE OUR SCHOOL SKIING. (I think some of the characters' sarcasm is rubbing off on me...) - I got Tamara (a guardian early on) and Tasha confused, and thought they were the same person. My bad. - Rose really does act childish in this one at times. Her character is a tricky one for me because there's times when I really love her, and other times when I really don't. I definitely appreciate her as a protagonist but her attitude about Tasha/Dimitri was particularly frustrating. I think Dimitri and her mum had a point with their lectures. Like that Tumblr post (about Disney princess I think), you can tell you're getting older when you agree with the characters' parents. - I'm really curious about how Lissa knew Adrian was a spirit user from him touching her. My brain likes the idea of some kind of spirit telepathy. - Lots of things are set up that have important roles later in the series like the Moroi fighting with magic, Rose absorbing the effects of spirit from Lissa, etc. so that's interesting. - What's fun about this re-read is seeing how much I remember and how much I've forgotten. At the moment it seems kind of half and half. - Seriously though I can't get over the difference in Adrian. Everyone's freaking out because Rose is seen with him and he has this big reputation, meanwhile I'm like... this guy's the other half of Sydrian. He's responsible! HE TAKES AND THEN TEACHES AN ART CLASS. - Sexual tension with Rose and Dimitri. Actual sex with Lissa and Christian... that Rose partly experiences through her best friend. Awkward. - \"Hey, little dhampir\" I actually forgot Adrian called Rose that. That shows it's been a while. - I'm one of those people that yells at the TV when stupid people do stupid things in movies, and it's the same with books. I knew what was going to happen yet I was like, seriously guys just LEAVE. Poor Mason and Eddie and everyone but they could have listened to me. - I actually kind of forgot how sad the ending was. It's not just Mason but the part with Rose breaking down and her mum comforting her. :( Not to mention Eddie. Oh gosh. That all hits me more than Shadow Kiss' ending easily. (Sorry Dimitri fans.) I mentioned in my rambles for the first book that I'm using sticky tabs to mark certain pages/passages and I have a colour just for foregrounding. Here's what I picked up on: - \"Humans and Moroi getting together will always make more dhampirs; that's where we came from in the first place. But that doesn't happen so much anymore; Moroi tend to stay away from humans.\" SYDRIAN! - \"Fortunately, I didn't believe anyone could actually take down Dimitri. I'd seen him kill a Strigoi without breaking a sweat. He was invincible. A badass. A god.\" Well... - \"What if he'd been seriously injured? Horrible visions danced through my mind. Mason with a broken leg... a broken neck...\" NOPE Frostbite was always one of my favourites in the series, and I really enjoyed it this time around (more than the first book but there's still little things I can pick on.) I like the introduction of Adrian, the hints of things to come, and the developments for spirit, Rose as a guardian, etc. (hide spoiler) ] ...more \u201cEveryone has light around them, except for you. You have shadows.\u201d OMG, I am really starting to love this series. Is it cringe-worthy at times? Sure is. Is it teen-angst filled drama? Yep, guilty. Is it so much damn fun? HELL YEAH! So this is the book where we get introduced to the infamous Adrian that I have heard so much of from VA fans. He certainly didn't disappoint. He did leave me with one problem though! I don't know if I'm team Adrian or Team Dimitri! TOO MANY HARD CHOICES! Liked that \u201cEveryone has light around them, except for you.

I don't know if I'm team Adrian or Team Dimitri! TOO MANY HARD CHOICES! Liked that this one was more fast-paced. Rose was still a brat, but I love her all the same. I feel she grew up a tiny bit by the end of the book. We shall see if that lasts. I have mixed feelings on Lissa. Rose basically gives her life for that girl and Lissa seems to be fairly entitled about the whole thing. I don't really think she completely appreciates what Rose does for her. She kind of dumped her at times for Christian. I do really like the character of Christian still. He's snarky and dark and I hope we get more development with his character. Ok spoiler time (view spoiler) [I did shed a few tears for Mason. I know that Rose was devastated but it was hard not to be a little frustrated at her for how she treated him. He was actually a good guy, so obviously she didn't want to be a part of that nonsense LOL It was cool to see her take down two Strigio and get her first marks for killing them. Also, FINALLY the relationship with Dimitri and her is starting to move. Yes, it's a bit of a turtle pace but I guess they have to build up the excitement. I better see some something more between them next book though! (hide spoiler) ] The storyline with her mother pretty good. I liked that her mom didn't spend the whole time trying to make it up to her. It felt a little more authentic to the character and why she made the decisions she did. I have never read Twilight so I can't compare them but if you like vampires, teen drama and lots of action check this one out. I think things are going to get very badass in the next book! ...more If I could give this book ten stars, I would. 3.5 stars. Didn't enjoy quite as much as the first book as far as plot goes, but did LOVE the infamous Adrian. Will continue on at some point, but must say the girl narrator on audiobook didn't quite fit Rose, I found her quite lacking for her feisty personality. originally posted at Writer of Wrongs WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS SERIES WOULD RUIN MY LIFE?

DAMN YOU BOOK DAMN YOU I admit that I have a terrible personality flaw, and it's that sometimes, I can be the worst hipster. It's been a long journey for me from the classic-reading snobby teenager I was to the adult who shrieks about ships on the internet and proudly draws fan art. Vampire Academy was an unfortunate casualty of my hipster snob years where I wasn't so into vampires or love triangles or things that were suuuper popular. ( The Hunger Games OBVIOUSLY super did not count for reasons Hipster Snobby Gillian probably could not explain with logic.) Basically? I'm an idiot, and this series rocks. The reason I am fast becoming obsessed with the Vampire Academy books can be summed up in two words: Rose Hathaway. I love this girl. Totally, unabashedly, and truly. I love her \"punch first, ask questions later\" attitude and the massive amounts of trouble this causes her. She is so flawed, so real, so kick ass, so snarky and confident and troubled and rash and dear vampire gods, she is the best. So truly the best. Her struggle in this book is all about control-- control over her feelings for her sexy guardian teacher, Dimitri, control over her rash impulses, control over her snarky rebelliousness, and control over the strange dark urges that threaten to overwhelm her sometimes. Rose's journey is a thing of beauty, and I know it's only the second book, so there's tons more to come. But Frostbite had such a heartbreaking and contained character arc. Rose learns important lessons, but with devastating consequences. In this installment, the Strigoi (aka the bad zombie vampires) are getting more organized and are slaughtering Moroi (the elite vampires who are really kind of lazy brats, let's be real). Rose and the rest of the dhampir (kick ass half-human half-vamp race devoted to protecting those lazy ass Moroi) need to figure out how to, you know, keep everyone from getting slaughtered. Rose and Lissa (her Moroi bff to whom she is both magically bound and totally devoted to) don't spend too much time together in this book, sadly, but their bond (both magical and non-) is still the underlying thread of the series. Throw in a ski trip, some hot-headed action-seeking dhampir, three hot boys, and Moroi politics about maybe POSSIBLY getting those lazy Moroi off their victimized magical asses, and we've got a mess of a situation. Hipster Snob Gillian totally underestimated this series. To be honest, the sentence-level prose is pretty weak at times, but the dialogue is fang-tastic (I am hilarious). The characters feel unique and distinct, and what's more, they're bloody funny (just like me haha see what I did there I am the best). I have such enormous amounts of love for Christian (seriously, can Rose and Christian team up and do all the things and just snipe at each other? Best odd couple ever). I also love Lissa and Mason and God, even Mia, who is a queen bitch most of the time but is fabulously humanized (...Moroi-ized?) in this installment. Then there's Rose's beyond strained relationship with her aloof guardian mother, and even that made me cry. BECAUSE YEAH. THIS BOOK? With the funny quippy vampires, and the hot boys (ADRIAN FUCKING IVASHKOV, OKAY? There will be a sonnet in his honor full paragraph about him below)? The only sane reaction to the words \"Adrian Ivashkov\" Yeah, okay, Taylor, enough Adrian-relate hip thrusts. The point is, this book hurts. HURTS. I did not know Mead was brave and evil and wonderful enough to take this book to the dark places it needed to go. I full on screeched at the ending. I cried. I CRIED. THIS BOOK MADE ME CRY. FUCK YOU, FROSTSHITE. I WAS NOT READY FOR THAT. God, these books are addictive. I didn't mean to read this! I picked it up and then all of a sudden I was 112 pages in and then Adrian \"King of my Heart\" Ivashkov showed up and like hell I was going to stop. And then the ending is SUPER INTENSE and Rose is my ultimate hero in life and ugh. Fine. Just what I needed. ANOTHER SERIES TO RUIN MY LIFE. Damn you, series. Okay, so let's talk about Adrian Ivashkov. Let's just talk about this divine morsel of Moroi magnificence, shall we? Seriously. Seriously . The moment he showed up and started tring to charm the (literal) pants off our stalwart heroine, my face just I actually do love Rose's chemistry with Dimitri (there is a scene up against a wall that made me keen like a humpback whale, I swear), but Adrian leapt off the page. He is so charming and funny and hot. I love Mead's characters so much, and Adrian is my second favorite of hers after Rose, who is turning out to be one of my top ever heroines. In Vampire Academy , I had a few quibbles with the premise, but they were pretty much totally shored up in Frostbite . And while the plot is a bit simplistic and the worldbuilding still a wee bit under developed, it is developing, and I know more is coming. And besides, what the plot builds to? And what Rose's personal plot and journey are? Hot damn. I love this book soooo much more than Vampire Academy , and I really enjoyed VA. But this book made me cry. GOD DAMN EVIL FANGTASTIC BLOODY BOOK. Silver stake me right through the damn heart. I CAN'T SHAKE THAT ENDING OFF DON'T ASK ME TO *eyes Shadow Kiss * No. I shouldn't I can't. Seriously, Taylor, stop wriggling like that. It's not going to happen. Can't stop won't stop reeeeeeading, it's like my heart is bleeeeeding NO, TAYLOR. I'm stopping. I'm stopping . I have a TBR. And a life. I can't just sit inside eating chocolate and crying over fictional vampires. I CAN'T. ...more I finally got to see what all the fuss is about. And yes, Adrian is all that and a bag of chips. Frostbite was much more action packed than the first book, and there was more of this. Luckily, still none of that. I want to give Rose and Dimitri a kick in the ass to get them moving. But, that was part of my prediction in book 1, so I'm not surprised. There's some annoying teen angst, again, not shocked. I'm liking the darker tone increasing as I go. A bit of disbelief at the end. So far, VA and I finally got to see what all the fuss is about. And yes, Adrian is all that and a bag of chips.

There is some of the normal stuff that teens have to deal with; peer pressure, the requisite blond \"mean girl,\" and sexual frustration, among other things. The difference here though is Rose is STRONG. She doesn't take crap from people, she sticks up for her friends, and she's smart. I'm sick of reading about simpering teen girls that let the popular kids walk all over them. Rose doesn't let anyone bully her, but she knows when to pick her fights and when to back down. Rose is funny too, she's such a smart ass and I love her for that. This book picks up after the end of the last one. Lissa is still being medicated to keep her dark thoughts away and her powers tamped down. Rose has slowly caught up to the rest of the novices in her studies and is about to take a test that she should have taken the year before. She and Dimitri take a trip to visit to another guardian who will administer the test to her. When they get to the house of the guardian and the Moroi that he protects, Rose and Dimitri find everyone dead, killed by Strigoi. They go back to the academy and it's decided that there's safety in numbers so for Christmas break everyone goes to a ski lodge together. Unfortunately though, there's another attack on one of the royal families and the guardians and Moroi struggle for an answer for keeping everyone safe. We meet a couple of new characters in this book, Adrian Ivashkov being my favorite. At times I was thinking that Rose should forget about Dimitri and just go for Adrian, but that's my love for bad boys speaking. Once everyone gets to the ski lodge, the story really picks up and the ending was pure craziness. I cried for about 10 pages near the end, it was all just really sad and intense. I loved everything about this book, I honestly can't find any faults with it. Even though the end was sad, it didn't make me like it any less. I'm scared to read the next one though, I've heard some people say that it was heartbreaking. But I love that Mead can pull those emotions from me and I'm excited to read the third book regardless.
