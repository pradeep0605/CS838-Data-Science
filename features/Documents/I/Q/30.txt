Not by a long shot. In fact, I can be pretty cold-hearted when it comes to romance books, remaining emotionless in the face of tragic heartbreak and loss. The Fault in Our Stars didn't move me. Eleanor & Park was cute, but still an average read for me. There's just certain things that I don't like. Emotionally manipulative books that feel as if the author set out with an agenda to tug at my heart strings - that would be up there with the worst. I guess I subconsciously rebel when I can see what the author's trying to do to my feelings. I avoid a lot of adult chick lit for this reason - because experience has shown that most of these books are like Lifetime movies: melodramatic and cheesily message-driven. But somehow - despite my reluctance to try this book because it seemed it would fall into all the aforementioned boxes - I ended up caving under the pressure and grabbing this book from my local library. I didn't expect much. I was just going to try a little bit and see how it went, feeling confident that it would be crappy and I would be right. But hell, I got schooled. I just... I can't even pretend anymore,<---M> screw the book snobbery</---M>, I thought <+++>Me Before You</+++> was wonderful. I laughed. I cried. I shipped like crazy. I stayed up most of the night. Being proven wrong may never have felt so good. I got the giggles about halfway through chapter one and struggled to get rid of them. Humour books are always a difficult sell because I guess it always depends on what you find funny... but I found <---C>Lou Clark</---C> to be an hilarious heroine. She's one of those charming but unfortunate individuals that finds herself in numerous awkward situations but somehow gets through them and just warms your heart with her delightful lack of propriety. I don't know if there is really such a thing as a \"British sense of humour\" but I've enjoyed a bunch of British chick lit/humour with similar MCs - Bridget Jones , Confessions of Georgia Nicholson - so maybe there's a pattern here with my tastes. If you're considering this book but think you're a shameless unromantic like me, DO NOT read any quotes from it. People keep pulling up these quotes about the meaning of life and carpe diem and it makes the whole thing seem much cheesier than it is. I thought there was a pleasant lack of cheese, hehe. It's also nowhere near as romantic as everything tries to make you think: the cover (<---B>the UK one is even worse</---B>), the blurb, the title... when actually there's very little romance. There is a touch of finding love in unexpected places and against the odds, but the main focus of this book is about life and the importance of choices. If you haven't already been told, the story is about Lou who needs a job and Will who needs a carer after an accident left him paralysed. Completely unable to move anything below his mid torso, Will longs for death and wants to go to Switzerland to put an end to his misery. Horrified by this discovery, Lou sets out to improve his life and give him a reason to live and look forward to each day. The relationship between them is told in such a wonderful way and develops through several stages, each filled with hilarity. I think people's reactions, emotions and decisions felt completely realistic in <+++>Me Before You</+++> , even if I didn't always like them. The whole book was filled with the funny, ridiculous situations that we expect to find in comic fiction, but balanced out with a hard dose of reality. It makes you think about things you didn't think about before without seeming like the author wanted to make you think about them. Things like just how depressing the lack of wheelchair access is in most venues. But there's a great balance between the funny and the serious, so the latter never becomes too much. This book made me feel all the emotions without seeming to try too hard. Love was found in a very unexpected place and I definitely want to check out the author's other work.

I see your ugly crying and I raise you some rage: This not a romance novel. This is a story that revolves around an immature, self-centered, vacuous woman named Louisa.

I see your ugly crying and I raise you some rage: This not a romance novel. This is a story that revolves around an immature, self-centered, vacuous woman named Louisa. She has no desire to do anything in life or better herself in any way, is perfectly content to work whatever job she can find, allow herself to be stuck in a loveless relationship, and forever remain a selfish child. FFS, the \"woman\" is 26 and still has the type of immature fights over clothing with her sister that you\u2019d expect from a pre-teen. She also has zero skills related to the care of the disabled, and yet somehow gets hired to be the caretaker for a quadriplegic, so clearly, she isn\u2019t the only idiot in this book. The man she\u2019s been hired to look after, Will, used to lead an incredible life. He was wealthy, successful, adventurous, athletic, passionate, and intelligent. Basically the complete opposite of our MC. He was injured in a freak accident and is now relegated to a wheelchair, and his spinal injury is high enough that he barely has the use of his hands. You\u2019d think his story alone would slap some sense into Louisa. WRONG Wanna know what changes her? Huh? Do ya??? A MAN This is where someone will likely want to argue with me. They\u2019ll want to tell me that\u2019s not how it was, because they\u2019ve convinced themselves that there\u2019s another reason. Well, there isn\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t change her mind because she realizes that any day could be her last. She doesn\u2019t change her mind because she realizes that she\u2019s let her past dictate her present. She doesn\u2019t change her mind because she realizes that she hasn\u2019t really been living at all. She changes her mind because Will forces her to step outside of her comfort zone. He tells her that she\u2019s intelligent *snort* and that she should pursue fashion because she likes to dress eccentrically. Yup, that\u2019s why she does it. Because he said so. Because his opinion of her means everything . So, for those of you who would like to argue about this, this is what I\u2019ll have to say to you: I had a lot of other issues with her, but they\u2019d all be spoilers and would likely fuel a full-fledged f-bomb laden rant from me, so I\u2019ll keep them to myself. One thing that struck me as singularly strange about this book was that towards the end of it the first person perspective shifted from our MC to other characters. I have no idea why. It didn\u2019t make me like characters I already hated and it didn\u2019t further the story in any way. That said, the moral of this book is a good one, and the writing wasn\u2019t bad - if a little inconsistent on the details at the end while trying to make the events fit together. Those are the only things that kept this from being a one star review. In the end, the main character absolutely ruined this for me. I disliked her so much that I didn\u2019t even read the epilogue, because I couldn\u2019t give two shits what she ended up doing with her life. And I'd just like to add one final \"ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME??!?!\" for the message this book sends that life just ain't worth living if you have a disability. Fuck right off.

It gives the impression of a bland and fluffy read when in reality this is a heartbreaking story, with subject matter that may be difficult for a lot of readers. The characters begin as likeable, yet maddeningly realistic in all their egocentricities and self-absorptions. As their fears and insights are exposed, they develop in strength and purpose to reveal rich individuals who are all irrevocably changed through the events which unfold. I enjoyed the first person POV, and the odd change in character thrown in stirred the narrative nicely for me. I would have liked to have had at least a chapter from Will's perspective, but can understand how challenging that may have been for the author. I was really glad to have read Will's letter though! I commend the author for producing a book which I found extremely readable; the language was straight forward, no purple prose or a whole bunch of medical jargon. The plot is relatively simple yet not uncomplicated for all that it raises some controversial or ethical questions. How can you read this and not ask yourself what you might do in similar circumstances, how you would feel if it was your friend? Could you be what they needed, and the moral impact of that. The writing is smooth and effortless and yet the result is a story which is invested with so much emotion. I'm left feeling so mad, sad and even, oddly, happily resigned about the ending. I can't remember when I last finished a story that had tied me up in so many emotional knots and still left me completely satisfied with having read it. I'll be chasing down more of Ms Moyes' works. ...more Being a male reader on a booksite you kind of expect to be outnumbered when it comes to the sexes.

Having personally cared for a handful of terminal people over a period of years, I feel I can safely say that many of the thoughts on serious aquired disabities and the quality of life is fairly realistic, and though the romance part can't avoid a bit of Hollywood-sheen, it never really gets unbelievable, and helps the reader engage him/herself in the characters and thus in their horrible dilemma.

I don't want to judge people for their opinion, but that's just disturbing. ---------Spoilers ahead------------------- Before I start, I want to say that I don't dislike this book because I'm strictly against any and every form of assisted suicide. It's a difficult subject with some valid arguments on both sides - in some cases, at least. I also don't have a problem with sad endings. I have different reasons for disliking it. Like a lot of people, I cried at the end of this book, but unlike probably most, not out of sadness, but out of anger. God, I was angry... Then I get on here and I see people quoting the book: \"Some mistakes... Just have greater consequences than others. But you don't have to let the result of one mistake be the thing that defines you. You, Clark, have the choice not to let that happen.\u201d \"You only get one life. It's actually your duty to live it as fully as possible.\u201d \"Just live well. Just live.\" How inspirational. Only... then Will basically drags all the meaning out of those quotes by deciding that this all applied to Lou, but not to himself. Why does he have to let his disability define him? He tells her to \"Just live.\" but it's okay for him to \"Just die.\"? \"Live boldly. Push yourself. Don\u2019t settle.\" What if Lou was happy with a simple life in a small town and a loving family? Is it really better to never settle than try to actually be happy with what you have? \"The thing is, I get that this could be a good life. I get that with you around, perhaps it could even be a very good life. But it's not my life. It's nothing like the life I want. Not even close. I loved my life, Clark. Really loved it. I loved my job, my travels, the things I was. I loved being a physical person. I liked riding my motorbike, hurling myself off buildings. I liked crushing people in business deals. I liked having sex. Lots of sex. I led a big life. I am not designed to exist in this thing - and yet for all intents and purposes it's now the thing that defines me. It is the only thing that defines me.\" Oookay... What? The f*? So it could be a very good life. But it's just not good enough for me. So, all the people who love me, go to hell, and I'm going to die. Because I just won't settle for less than perfect. I would have had an easier time understanding the book if he had been miserable until the end. If the book had showed us that his life really was miserable and he couldn't go on, it would have been incredibely sad and depressing (still entirely unromantic), but I would get that. Let him die of pneumonia. That would be sad, but at least it wouldn't send such a disturbing message. As it is, the book spends two thirds showing us that they can actually have happy moments and that he can actually love and be happy. But it's just not enough. Because: Don't settle. Now, I'm not claiming to even remotely be able to imagine what Will must feel like or how difficult his life is - but there are thousands of people out there, who live very difficult lives and still manage to be happy or at least try. I have a very deep respect for those people. But Will can't be happy or try because he can no longer go to Paris and go skiing and do all those super-amazing things he did in his life before - and just enjoying music, loving and being loved simply won't do. It just seemes to me like the overall message of the book is a very shallow one for this. Another thing, that makes me a little mad, is how in the book he says something like: dying is the first time he's actually made his own decision since the accident (or something along those lines). This just blows my mind! You don't lose all your choices because you can't move your legs and arms. He made tons of choices during the course of the book. He chose to be rude to Lou, he chose to be nice to Lou, he chose not to go out, he chose to go out, he chose to go to Alicia's wedding, he chose to go to Mauritius... All those things weren't his choices? He also had a lot more choices, considering all the money they had - yes, he was very limited in some \"choices\", but that doesn't mean he didn't have any. So, no, dying wasn't the first time he made his own choice. What it was, was the last time he made any choice. It wasn't the accident that took away all of his choices, it was deciding to die. And that's not brave, let alone romantic. It completely blows my mind that there are people reviewing this who found that ending romantic - I'm not sure how romantic you would find it if the person you loved wanted to commit suicide... Also, it was incredibly selfish. Will didn't just make a choice for his life, he made one for the people he loved and who loved him. And no matter how unpopular that opinion may be in today's super-individualistic world that sees self-fulfillment as the highest achievable goal, I actually believe that our duty not to hurt the people we love is - in general - a little more important than the duty to \"live our life as fully as possible.\" \"I liked riding my motorbike, hurling myself off buildings. I liked crushing people in business deals. I liked having sex. Lots of sex. I led a big life.\" Maybe this explains it. Maybe Will is just an incredibly shallow person. He didn't really feel like that to me for large stretches of the book, but maybe that's just it. And maybe that's what made me so angry. ___ P.S.: There's been some controversy about the story in connection with the release of the movie, and since I've discussed this a little in the comments, I thought I'd add a few notes into the body of the review as well - on why the message this story sends is so problematic. Starting with what the message actually is: I don't think the author intended to tell us that a disabled life is not worth living and I would never accuse her of that. She made an effort to show that Will's life could be a good life and I have a feeling most readers understood that. The problematic part comes in where she presents it as a (psychologically) normal thing for him to still want to die. This reenforces very dangerous assumptions society already has about people with disabilities. Many (able bodied) people have commented that they completely understand Will and if they were in his position they'd want to die too. They are wrong. And I can say this, because there is actual data on this - the vast majority of people with similar disabilities as Will do not want to die. They adjust - with time and the right support and treatment. So when a disabled person has suicidal thoughts it is not our duty as a society to \"empower\" them to take their own life. It's our duty to give them the best possible care, treatment and support so they stop being suicidal. One argument frequently brought up is that this is the story of just one man. That it's not meant to be representative of all disabled people. While this may be a valid argument for any single story, the problem remains that these kinds of stories are vastly overrepresented in mainstream media. When was the last time a major Hollywood movie featured a quadriplegic lead character who didn't want to die? When you're creating content that has such an impact on such a gigantic audience, you cannot flinch from the responsibility of the message you're sending by claiming that it's \"just one story\". It isn't just one story. You're influencing people's opinions about disability and suicide on a huge scale. And you're doing it in the worst possible way. ...more Update 2/20/17 - Lowering my rating from 4.99 stars to 4 because while I really enjoyed this romance, after hearing how harmful this book is to individuals with disabilities, I don't feel comfortable placing a higher rating on this book.

Me Before You is a story surrounding two main characters, Will Taynor and Lou Clark. Lou is just average. She is barely floating through life. Long time job, rocking a steady boyfriend, and just above average taste in clothes. Will Taynor was a successful business man. Constantly traveling, being active, and enjoying his above average life. This all changes when Lou is laid off work and Will is in a major accident leaving him a quadriplegic. After these events happen you'll more than likely be thinking the same thing I thought, \" wow I know exactly where this cliche story is going to go \", and just like me you'll more than likely be wrong. Lou is struggling with what and who she wants to be. At 26 she really has no aim in life. She finds herself at a job center which offers her the chance to be a sort of caregiver to Will. Will is the definition of a broken human.\u00a0 After two years of having no control over his life he has just given up hope.

I was worried when I got over 150 pages in and the book was still at that same pace. Once getting closer to the end I saw why it was that way. This story builds to something so amazing. I wish I could come up with a better, more lyrical word than \"amazing\", but I don't think they've invented a word yet to describe the end of this story. The end of this book had me on the floor balling my eyes out. Not kidding... at one point I went to the bathroom to get a tissue and just sat on the floor and cried. Not only did Me Before You make me cry, it made me think. I had me thinking hours after putting it down. It has some amazing moral questioning factors thrown into this wonderful love story. It will make you wonder how far you would be willing to go to make the person you love happy. Once it got closer to the ending I saw where it as going. I thought I wouldn't be happy with how she chose to end it, but the ending was perfect. I don't think it could have ended any other way. This is a book of the purest most selfless love. I don't know when the next time will be that I get to read a love story quite like this. THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ OF MUST READS. One of the best novels ever recommended to me. Thank you.

He used to be an adventurous person, ambitious and confident, living every moment to the fullest and now, he couldn't even eat without help. And then he met Lou. Lou with her crazy clothes and lack of dreams invaded his life, trying to make him find beauty in simple things and adapt to his new reality, but she didn't predict that she would change as well, that she would find her place in the world and someone to really see the potential and fire in her.

Hope and terror , terror and hope danced and kissed and fought while the clock was ticking, while you held your breath and prayed, while you laughed and cried. There would be gut-wrenching moments and then some sweet moments that warmed you up and made you forget the knife that was twisting in your heart. She created flawed, realistic characters , family relationships that were far from perfect but you sympathized with each and everyone of them. She made you contemplate situations with religious, moral and legal aspects and understand the reasoning of both sides, even though it was killing you inside. She made you appreciate the things you take for granted. \u201cYou only get one life. It's actually your duty to live it as fully as possible.\u201d I loved Lou and Will with all my heart , as individuals and as two people who fell in love when they shouldn't. Will's sarcasm was his last defense, he didn't want pity or sympathy ,he just wanted the ability to make his own decisions and even that was taken away from him. Lou on the other hand was always treated as if she was stupid, she never had the chance to shine, she never dared dream a different, more exciting life. Two lost souls with nothing to fight for crossed paths. Two blind people found their light. And for a while, it was enough. \u201cHow is it you have the right to destroy my life, I wanted to demand of him, but I\u2019m not allowed a say in yours?\u201d It hurts. It hurts so darn much.

I was warned it would come as a shock, and even the author gently glided our thoughts toward that idea, but I still felt that PANG in my chest when reading the ending. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about that, for fear of spoiling anything for you. Louisa is a simple girl. She works. She cares for her family. She does what she has to do. She doesn\u2019t take risks or ever act recklessly. It\u2019s not who she is; her responsibilities come first. Will\u2019s playground is life itself. He has a great job, a great girlfriend and the means to go wherever he wants and do whatever he desires. That is, before the accident happens. Now, he\u2019s in a wheelchair, paralysed and dead inside. The man he was before is gone, now he can\u2019t even recognize himself. When Louisa and Will meet, there is no love at first sight. She is his new caregiver. He is someone she can\u2019t decipher. But the more they spend time together, the more Louisa discovers the wonders that life has to offer. I read Me Before You , expecting to discover the most poignant love story on earth. But I found something else instead. This is the story of a twenty-six-year-old woman who has no long-term objective in life and doesn\u2019t think about her future. She never left the country and stays away from anything remotely dangerous. Will is determined to open her eyes to the unknown. With him by her side, she gains confidence, determination, learns not to let anyone dictate her actions and finally realizes what is best for her. She needs him in her life, even though she doesn\u2019t know it, and he relishes in her presence. He is her sun and she is his. The themes of acceptance, family, friendship and life are even more present than the love one. And I realized that it\u2019s all those developed themes that made me like this book so much. Cheesy, corny, clich\u00e9d, overdone are all terms that DO NOT apply to this book. It\u2019s unlike any contemporary book I\u2019ve read before. Louisa is a charming woman with a sense of humor and fantastic imagination. Reading the book through her perspective was utterly delightful. We also have sporadic chapters narrated from other characters, such as Will\u2019s mom and Louisa\u2019s sister. Maybe you\u2019re not a fan of romance. Maybe you don\u2019t like chick literature or maybe you never read adult books. I\u2019m here to tell you that it doesn\u2019t matter. It will not affect your enjoyment of this book. You know why? Me Before You will win you over, whether you want it to or not.

I decided to read this book right after watching the trailer and crying, partly because Mr. Bates from Downton Abbey was there (every single time he shows up- tears start streaming down my face) and partly because the story was so moving. But I honestly did not expect this book to impact me this emotionally. I thought Me Before You was going to be another book in the pile of books similar to John Green\u2019s The Fault In Our Stars \u2014 but they cannot even compare in my eyes. While TFIOS made me feel like an emotionless robot, Me Before You made me think and contemplate and feel so many things all at once- I cried and laughed and felt anxious and hopeful. I just can\u2019t get over how good this book is, it\u2019s both sad and full of life. This story starts out with Lou Clark losing her job at The Buttered Bun tea shop and I could honestly really relate to the way she was feeling during that period, especially with the financial responsibility she held for her family. I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t quit after her first day with Will. After that memorable first day, she and Will start to get used to each other and even on occasion opening up a bit one with the other. Nathan walked in as I was finishing the dishes. \u2018He\u2019s in a good mood,\u2019 he said, as I handed him a mug. \u2018Is he?\u2019 \u2018He says you\u2019re trying to poison him. But he said it \u2013 you know \u2013 in a good way.' And what follows after that is a series of outings with Will, to try and make the 6 months that he has left as memorable as possible. (Their second outing to the concert made me tear up, I could imagine it so vividly.) 'So you\u2019re not a classical music person.\u2019 I looked into the rear-view mirror. Will was smiling. \u2018I didn\u2019t enjoy that in the slightest.\u2019 \u2018I could tell.\u2019 \u2018I especially didn\u2019t enjoy that bit near the end, the bit where the violin was singing by itself.\u2019 \u2018I could see you didn\u2019t like that bit. In fact, I think you had tears in your eyes you hated it so much.' And I felt truly relieved when Patrick and Lou finally broke up \u2014 it was as if a huge weight had been lifted off of me. I was waiting for it to happen throughout the whole book because I just felt extremely uncomfortable whenever Patrick showed up (especially on Lou\u2019s birthday). But all in all, there isn\u2019t a word for this book that can describe just how much it meant to me. I felt really connected to Lou and Will and their families. Me Before You had extremely vivid characters, infectious humor, and bittersweet truth. And that ending definitely crushed me even though I knew what was coming \u2014 it did not make it easier to read and experience. It hurts.

The first thing you should know is it's very rare that I give a book one star because I can usually find SOMETHING enjoyable about it. But, that's not the case here. There were absolutely no redeeming qualities in this book for me. In fact, there were a total of two points (and by points I mean singular lines) in this book where I genuinely liked what was said. The first was when Treena said, \"Oh, for Christ's sake, Lou. For once in your life, just get a grip\" (Page 347) and the second was when Louisa said, \"It's not my decision, Mum. It's Will's,\" (Page 350). Both of which, I had been screaming for the ENTIRE DURATION OF THE BOOK. Apart from those two lines, everything else about this book made want to tear my hair out. First, let's talk about the writing. Before I started reading, I was under the impression that this book had \"beautiful\" prose, because that's what I'd heard from countless people. What I would consider \"beautiful\" writing (i.e. The Night Circus, Ava Lavender, Ari and Dante) is the type of writing that resonates with and is breathlessly easy to follow. But what I got in this book were gems like: \"I could have looked at his face all night. The way his eyes wrinkled at the corners. That place where his neck met his shoulder.\" (Page 265). \"That place where his neck met his shoulder\" Someone please explain to me what that means???? Also add in a few \"I let out a breath I didn't know I was holding\"s and you can basically sum up the writing in this book. Point being, I was bored, it elicited no emotion from me, and I had to drag myself through each chapter. The characters? They were all insufferable. Will is a moody, brooding, bitter ass who stays a moody, brooding, bitter ass until the very end. Of course he's also rich, handsome, stubborn, and loves literature and all aspects of \"high culture\" society. The perfect recipe for your stereotypical heartthrob. Louisa is a 26 year old woman who has no motivation to do anything with her life until a man comes in and ~*~changes her~*~ Oh and then of course you have to add in a little dash of sexual assault to make your main character more interesting because, you know, you can't have a good book without THAT. Now let's address the unbearable plot. This whole book is based around the ridiculous premise that Louisa is trying to find a way to \"save\" Will by giving him a reason to live. It's essentially 369 pages of Louisa, an able bodied person, who decides that SHE knows when a disabled person is ready to die. Only to \"learn\" that she doesn't have the right to make that decision and he's just gonna die anyway. So you're left reading a book that can only have one possible ending. If this was supposed to be a story about Louisa learning that she was wrong\u2026 shouldn't the reader learn with her? Because you don't. You know from the very beginning exactly how the book is going to end. Talk about predictability. Also I will just briefly mention that while I do think that making a commentary on physician assisted suicide is important and it's a topic that deserves discussion, I don't think that this was the best or most productive way to go about it. Overall I think it did more harm than good to use it as a plot device in a book that's marketed as a romance novel. Were you waiting for my thoughts on the ableism? Here you go. First off, as an able bodied person, I know my place and I'm not going to try to speak on behalf of anyone or pretend to know more about the issue than I do. That being said, I\u2019m still going to call this book out for the ableist themes it perpetuates. The whole message of this book is that no matter what lengths someone goes for you, how much love, wealth, or support you have, living a disabled life is so unbearable that the only thing to do is to kill yourself. Do with that what you will, but nothing about that message is right or okay in my eyes. But again, I am speaking only from my perspective. So here are a couple of links to articles written by disabled people about their thoughts on the ableism in this book: http://www.dominickevans.com/2016/02/... https://crippledscholar.wordpress.com... Honestly the only thing about this book that made me cry was how painful it was to keep reading. I NEVER DNF books, yet I was SO close to putting this one down. But I just couldn't do it because I wanted to be able to talk about it in its entirety. So there you have it. All of my thoughts on this wildly popular, well loved book. So much for going to see the movie. ...more LIVE BOLDLY. PUSH YOURSELF.

This is not a sappy book with silly characters that fall in love and that\u2019s it. This is a book about friendship, love, patience, ambitions and many many many more things . Yes, you\u2019re gonna cry if you\u2019re human but you\u2019re gonna LAUGH, a lot! Because Will & Lou are smart asses that will make you love them from the beginning. You know what? I had the pleasure of reading this gem on paperback and I marked the whole damn book and I was planning to quote some of the best sentences but I am NOT gonna do that. You wanna know why? Because you need to experience this book, you need to read it blind This book will teach you to LIVE BOLDLY Will used to live boldly, he was an attractive guy on his early thirties with a great job, a hot girlfriend and an amazing life in London until one day everything changes. Two years later he crosses paths with Lou who apparently has nothing in common with him. But they have to spend time together whether they like it or not. And they don\u2019t like it, they actually hate each other at the beginning of their story. But sometimes, life puts you on a place for a reason and you open your mind and start seeing things that you didn\u2019t even see before. This book will teach you to PUSH YOURSELF Lou was a normal girl in a normal city with a normal life, a normal boyfriend and a normal job. Until one day things changes for her, she loses her job and she has to PUSH HERSELF to things she never thought about. But she discovers that pushing your limits, walking outside your comfort zone is not that bad. And this book will teach you to DON\u2019T SETTLE No matter how hard your life is, you can\u2019t settle, you need to look forward, you need to live, LIVE WELL. JUST LIVE This book is the reason why I read! And this is how you write Romance. I am VERY TIRED of hotties falling in love after watching each other and feeling an instant electricity. No! That\u2019s not real. Will & Lou hated each other at the beginning, Lou was forced to be with him and he didn\u2019t have any choice at all BUT they got to know each other and they fell in love and OMG it was so freaking beautiful because that\u2019s love, REAL LOVE. Lou would have done EVERYTHING for him and he proved his love for her too. This book just taught me that there are people who are worth it out there . People like Lou who would leave everything behind to help someone like Will. People like Will who would push Lou to LIVE even though that would mean she wouldn't be around that much. There is NOTHING about this book I can complain about . ANYTHING, NADA! I understood every single character, their POVs, even Will's dad. I would have love to read Will\u2019s POV in at least one chapter but loved the book anyway. My favourite part was Alicia\u2019s wedding . That moment when they were looking at each other, than hunger for something they could give to each other, that passion, that LOVE and respect\u2026 The below are my personal thoughts, I understand you might have your owns and you might think I am evil, that\u2019s ok. I will respect all your opinions, hope you can respect mine. Living with someone like Will and loving someone like Will is NOT easy and (view spoiler) [ I understand what they did, if you love someone you would do ANYTHING to see that person happy (hide spoiler) ] I am totally against (view spoiler) [ suicide but in this case I truly understood him and I would have helped him to go to Switzerland. He was living a miserable life, he wasn't happy and he has the right to decide what to do with his life. (hide spoiler) ] We had a similar case in Spain. Ramon San Pedro was in the same conditions than Will (view spoiler) [ and he did exactly the same and when I saw that on the news I was a teen but even then I understood him (hide spoiler) ] .

There are times that he is such a tease and it was nice to know that after so long he finally seems happier . After a while we see that due to his state Lou doesnt want to leave him alone , much less quit her job . Will inevitably manages to become part of her life and her daily routine . Sadly , Will is hiding something . He is an adult and he has the right to do whatever he wants with his life but damn I dont know if I agree with his thoughts. Wouldnt it be selfish to stop him? Of course it would be but still it doesnt feel right. If I were him I might wanted to do the same but if I had someone like Lou caring for me I dont think that I would consider it like an option anymore .

First read: June 2013 I remember when I was a little girl the excitement of a really good book just took me away from whatever was going on in my life. Books have always been my escape and my peace. I had gone through a reading slump in the last months and I've picked it back up finally. After reading this book I'm so glad that I did. This book to me spun it's magic around me and encompassed me in it. I laughed and cried so hard I thought my heart was breaking too. There was not one line in the whole book I didn't love. Amazing writing on a hard subject. Jojo Moyes made the most wonderful characters of Lou and Will come to life for me. I loved them both and just hate that book reviews just cannot do them justice. I kept putting it down so I would not finish it in a hurry but could not leave it alone. Best book I have read in years.

We have been told that we are the creators of our own fates. But what happens when the fate has different plans for you? Where fate rips everything you ever loved away from you? \"I drew a world for him, a world in which he was still somehow the person he had wanted to be. I drew the world he had created for me, full of wonder and possibility.\u201d Not only that this book will make you cry , it will make you laugh too. It's not a classic love story . It's a story of LIFE and DEATH. But it's also a story of friendship, of love.

Louisa \"Lou\" Clark. Lou lost her job recently, and her family is in chaotic position. In desperation, she accepts the job of being a care taker. I was twenty-six years old and I wasn\u2019t really sure what I was. Up until I lost my job I hadn\u2019t even given it any thought. I supposed I would probably marry Patrick, knock out a few kids, live a few streets away from where I had always lived. Apart from an exotic taste in clothes, and the fact that I\u2019m a bit short, there\u2019s not a lot separating me from anyone you might pass in the street. You probably wouldn\u2019t look at me twice. An ordinary girl, leading an ordinary life. It actually suited me fine. It's a story about a man who lost everything in just one day. William \"Will\" Traynor. \u201cI will never, ever regret the things I've done. Because most days, all you have are places in your memory that you can go to.\u201d Will lost everything in an accident, but worst of all, he lost the chance to live normally for the rest of his life. Because of it, he lost the will to live. \u201cThe thing about being catapulted into a whole new life--or at least, shoved up so hard against someone else's life that you might as well have your face pressed against their window--is that it forces you to rethink your idea of who you are. Or how you might seem to other people.\u201d Until the day Lou appeared in his life as his care taker for six months. At first, they argue a lot. Will doesn't think Lou can handle being his care taker for that period of time, but Lou is not a person who easily gives up. \u201cSome mistakes... Just have greater consequences than others. But you don't have to let the result of one mistake be the thing that defines you. You, Clark, have the choice not to let that happen.\u201d And after a while, when Will realizes he cannot push her away like he did to everyone else, he accepts Lou for what she is. A kind person who through time reached to him and showed him that not everything is dark - that there are still choices and that life is worth living. \u201cI turned in my seat. Will\u2019s face was in shadow and I couldn\u2019t quite make it out. \u2018Just hold on. Just for a minute.\u2019 \u2018Are you all right?\u2019 I found my gaze dropping towards his chair, afraid some part of him was pinched, or trapped, that I had got something wrong. \u2018I\u2019m fine. I just . . . \u2019 I could see his pale collar, his dark suit jacket a contrast against it. \u2018I don\u2019t want to go in just yet. I just want to sit and not have to think about . . . \u2019 He swallowed. Even in the half-dark it seemed effortful. \u2018I just . . . want to be a man who has been to a concert with a girl in a red dress. Just for a few minutes more.\u2019 I released the door handle. \u2018Sure.\u2019 I closed my eyes and lay my head against the headrest, and we sat there together for a while longer, two people lost in remembered music, half hidden in the shadow of a castle on a moonlit hill.\u201d * Serious spoilers * (view spoiler) [ i respect Will's choice in the end, even though it broke my heart - but he finally had control over something and he chose it. \u201cAll I can say is that you make me...you make me into someone I couldn't even imagine. You make me happy, even when you're awful.I would rather be with you- even the you that you seem to think is diminished- than with anyone else in the world.\u201d (hide spoiler) ] ____________________________________________ OVERALL : ____________________________________________ Everything in this book felt real: the characters, the reactions of people around them, the struggles and fights they had gone through. A slow progressing romance ... where people didn't fall in love because of money or physical beauty - but a love between people who love each other for who they are. And it makes it real . And most of all, it showed that there are still people worth fighting for. People who need help, and people who will do everything in their power to give them support. Overall, beautiful and moving book, and i can't tell you how much i love it! Because it's realistic. This review can be found on my blog: infinity-of-time.blogspot.com also known as...

I'm one of those people that as soon as I hear a book is being made into a movie, I decide I should read it. But honestly with this one, I have no clue why I waited so long. I have heard over and over about how much others have enjoyed it and yet held off myself. Lesson learned. Me Before You is the story of a young girl who finds herself the caretaker of a quadriplegic man who is both charming and brash depending on the mood. And yet, there's something about him that she Oh goodness heartbreak. I'm one of those people that as soon as I hear a book is being made into a movie, I decide I should read it.

Me Before You is the story of a young girl who finds herself the caretaker of a quadriplegic man who is both charming and brash depending on the mood. And yet, there's something about him that she finds herself drawn to. In order to help make his life better, she plans out a fantastic series of events in order to make him happy. I must tell you, the characters in this story are perfectly done. They're lovable, hatable, questionably insane - but all so wonderfully done that you never get bored. I started this book while on a plane to Hawaii and despite my happiness toward embarking on a vacation, I still cried. Good God, the emotions. If you can make it through this one without shedding a tear, hats off to you. I couldn't do it. What did I think?: This is one of the most emotional books I have read in a long time, if not ever. I absolutely can't wait for the movie, and after hearing about the casting I'm even more exciting. I don't know whether to call it \"chick-lit\" as I think there's something in it for everyone, but it's certainly an easy read, but one that should probably not be read in public because crying in public is apparently a weird thing to do. Who should read it?: Are you looking for a good book? Read it. Are you in need of a good cry? Read it. Are you planning to see the movie? Read it. Are you going to be forced/dragged to the theaters by someone else in order to see the movie? Read it. You get the picture. (Read it.) WEBSITE | TWITTER | FACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM ...more SO. I know that practically the whole world loves this book, and I'm not trying to undermine the majority. Truly, I'm not. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, the biggest ( only? ) downside to training yourself to read books critically for review, is that you can't turn it off. I may never be able to devour a book, paying zero attention to anything but how it makes me feel, and enjoying it without any kind of expectations ever again.

But hopefully , you now feel sorry for me, horrified by analytical approach to reading-for-pleasure, and no longer want to tar and feather me for besmirching the honor of one of your best loved books. *crosses fingers* I have three main issues: 1. The unequal cost vs. gain ratio. I won't try to deny that the conclusion of ME BEFORE YOU packed a powerful emotional punch. BUT. My tears weren't the result of pain felt on behalf of poignant characters who had been brought to life by a talented writer. The situation was tragic, so I felt pain. BUT. No more or less than I would have felt if I'd read the same scenario in a book summary or a 500 word article in the local paper. I could try to isolate reasons for the disconnect, like it's told in the third person, but that feels like a cop-out--I've encountered plenty of compelling characters in third person POV books--but ultimately, Will and Lou didn't join those ranks. The end. 2. Gratuitous use of personal tragedy to justify behavior that didn't need justification. Moyes took what would have been the most interesting aspect of this tale (Lou's quirky fashion sense), and turned it into coping mechanism. I'm usually all for gaining insight into characters, but that insight needs to be meaningful . Turning a young woman with a colorful and unapologetically wacky fashion sense into a victim, who is merely trying to disguise her femininity is . . . Well, it's offensive. It suggests that you must be damaged to escape conformity, that you can't be an individual for the sake of individuality, or simply b/c YOU'RE DIFFERENT. 3. Postmodernism makes my nostrils flare. ME BEFORE YOU is a dispiriting combination of selfishness and pointlessness masquerading as a love story. I've frequently addressed my feelings on Postmodernism, so I won't reiterate the long version here, but suffice it to say, I HATE it. I hate the inevitability of pain and disappointment and of mediocrity. I hate the implication that Bad Things will happen, so the best you can do is bear it gracefully, or, at the very least, with stoicism. Reality is something I avoid when reading recreationally, so encountering the kind of inescapable sadness and loss often found in Postmodern literature is something I assiduously steer clear of. Sometimes with limited success . . . If you share my view, do yourself a favor and skip this one. In my opinion, ME BEFORE YOU is a headache you don't need. The only part of the story that didn't shriek of the uselessness of hope in the face of reality, was Lou's personal growth throughout her endeavor, which annoyingly makes me want to read AFTER YOU to see if the changes stuck, and will almost certainly be another disappointment. Ugh. My review of After You ...more Una historia bella y conmovedora, creo que le\u00ed este libro en un momento bastante adecuado, aprend\u00ed muchas cosas que espero poner en practica pronto y disfrute la lectura de principio a fin. Me encant\u00f3 el humor negro y sarc\u00e1stico de Will y la relaci\u00f3n que construye con Lou y aunque se me hizo bastante predecible el final de la historia, esto no hizo que me parecer\u00eda menos conmovedor y emotivo. I need a hug. In fact, can someone just hold me for a week? I think I am just gonna curl up in a ball and keep sobbing now. Just RIP MY HEART OUT WHY DON'T YOU. I really loved this story and these characters a lot. A lot a lot. A really fantastic read. Can't write more right now because CANNOT PROCESS.
