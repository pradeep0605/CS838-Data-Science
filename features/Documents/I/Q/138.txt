If you wait for some Rachel-Ivy action then you may get disappointed.. I did, too. I'm not a hardcore shipper but there's an undeniable love between them and a bond too, that could easily evolve into something else if Rachel gave them a chance. At the end of the day, I just want them to be happy. I'll dive into the next book soon and hope we get some answers because I'm dying to see the person responsible for (view spoiler) [Kisten's (hide spoiler) ] death suffer the same fate. ...more Reviewed by: Rabid Reads I mentioned in my review of For a Few Demons More that Al was in trouble with the demons and wanted Rachel to help him out . . .

So Al's HELLA pissed (b/c he's a total blame shifter) and in demon jail, but only during the day, b/c he's arranged for someone to summon him to the real world as soon as the sun sets everyday. But who? Hmmm?? Probably not who you're thinking . . . Regardless of who is doing it, Al's getting out every night for the express purpose of terrorizing Rachel and her loved ones. He's a demon with nothing to lose, and a demon with nothing to lose is not a happy or fun demon. So that's a problem. But that's not all, b/c this is another installment with ALL THE THINGS happening, and it is as fantastic as For a Few Demons More . We finally (finally, FINALLY) get some Ivy and Rachel resolution. FINALLY. Rachel finds out what really happened to her dad. Ceri has some BIG news, which prompts Trent to ask Rachel to go to the ever after with him (just like their fathers), and, oh yeah, Marshal (of scuba diving, Mackinaw fame) shows up on Rachel's doorstep, and so does a teenage gargoyle who likes to spit.<------Bis is an awesome addition to the gang. A few more really Big Deals happen, but that's all I can give you without spoilers. Suffice it to say that <+++>The Outlaw Demon Wails</+++> is only the second in a long run of increasingly excellent books from The Hollows .

Rachael -- more mature Ivy -- more sane Jenks -- still keeping it real Ceri -- big suprises Al -- big suprises Kristen -- still dead Rachael's Mom -- big suprises Trent -- whoa is me. I love him but he doesn't give me much to work with. In this installment, Rachael has to face some rough truths. My heart went out to her as she struggled with so many variables. I didn't get frustrated with her decision-making process as in previous books because she actually took a minute to think. That was new and I embraced her as a woman who learned from her mistakes. Al is back and on a rampage. No one is safe from his constant attempts at vengence against Rachael. She has to deal with him and she does. Trent discovers there is dna in the Ever After that can help him restore fertility to the Elves. He hires Rachael to go with him as his protector. The journey doesn't take up many pages overall but what we learn changes things forever. Ms. Harrison put Rachael and her friends through some paces but I loved where it all ended. Although Rachael didn't hookup with Trent, I'm still hopeful but realize it would be a major plot development that won't happen overnight. There are plenty of demons in this book and we get to see more of the world they inhabit. Although Al is a sick puppy, I like the character and am glad he was such a big part of this story. A new character, Blis, has moved into Rachael's church. He is a gargoyle and we don't learn much about him in this book. I expect that will change going forward. Rachael has a new 'love' interest whose name I already forgot. He is boring but I am hopeful that shiny new penny is more than it appears. The biggest plot development for me was seeing the drama level go down a notch with Ivy. I actully understand her better and am hoping she continues to find a balance for herself and her friendship with Rachael. I am sure Ms. Harrison will make me eat those words at some point but I wanted to at least get it down in writing for the record. I am going to continue with the series as I am now addicted. I have 3 to go before I am caught up. Book 7 is not loved by the series fans so I expect to read that one slower. I have basically gobbled the others down. ...more Let me first get the biggest rant out of the way first and foremost. I usually ingest all my books via audiobook format.

I usually ingest all my books via audiobook format. There are some really good folks that do the reading and lots of so so folks.

As she is a great reader, all the characters had their distinct voice and mannerisms and she kept on target perfectly. Then all of the sudden she is replaced by Gigi Bermingham who screwed it up royally. Obviously there was a serious breakdown in the editing and publishing of this book. First the reader decided that lots of established characters and places should be pronounced totally differently than the previous 4 books. How aggravating! How could the publisher and editor let this through? Didn't this reader even listen to some of the previous audiobooks to get a clue? Didn't the management even listen to the audiotapes before publishing it? Next is the unfortunate issue that the reader did not have the talent to portray the different characters with different voice inflection. Well, she did try but she kept getting screwed up and switching them all up. How annoying! The worst voice was her grating portrayal of Jenks. This reader ruined the book for me. She is not truely to blame as any reader depends on her team and this team f*ed up. I do see that they go back to the original reader after this book so I will continue with the series. Phew! All in all I am enjoying this series. I do take exception to some truely stupid things that the main character <---C>Rachel Morgan</---C> does. I think she shows too much fear for a person in her line of work and she is way too much of a prude as well. Sometimes she has flashes of cleverness but then slaps herself with moments of stupid naievity that makes me scream in my head.

Save for one or two things, the ending of the book could have been the sort of satisfying conclusion of the series. Kist's killer still hasn't been found, but considering that she didn't realize until she was writing book 7 that he needed to die in book 5 she did a remarkable job of working in everyone's grief. In fact, if I hadn't herd her say that she had to go back and work all that in I'd never have known that wasn't part of the plan. And Jenks mortality is still an issue, though frankly Matalina seems much closer to not surviving the winter. I think part of what makes it feel like a conclusion is that Rachel really has grown up. She's thinking before reacting more often now. She's not just saying she should grow up, she's doing it. And she's clearly starting a new phase in her life. I'm a little sad about where things ended up with Ivy. I suppose I should be happy that she clearly does like Ivy for Ivy and not just the vamp pheromones, something which Ivy finally knows, too. But my hope for anything but a close friendship has died. I can't argue that it doesn't make sense. Clearly it's safer for everyone this way and I've always been really turned off by the idea of a vampire literally owning and controlling another person, even if love is involved. Plus, I've never been a fan of selective bisexuality. Ivy is clearly bi and that's great, but the only woman Rachel's ever been sexually attracted to is Ivy and so on some level it's hard for me to believe it's anything more than vamp pheromones. We'll see. Right now my money's on Rachel ending up with Trent. As for the story itself, I enjoyed it. It was interesting to see the Ever After. I'd like it if the gargoyle became a reoccurring character. I am worried about Matlalina though. Even if Jenks can be saved I'm not sure he'd particularly want to be if she were gone. I'm ready to be done with Marshall. The white knight thing gets old very quickly where the woman in question is more than capable of taking care of herself better than the knight could even dream of doing. And it was fun seeing more of Rachel's mom. It goes a long way toward explaining why Rachel is the way she is. ...more With everything that happened in book five, all the drama, tragedy and heartache, it was hard not being a little nervous about what Harrison would throw our way this time. But with a brave smile on my face, I dived right in. There was no way that I couldn't. I had to know what happened next.

I am so very glad that I waited to start this series until all the books were out because binge reading this series is so the way to go. They are so addicting and hard to put down and with so much on the line for Rachel, I couldn't see having to wait months for the next book, I think it would have killed me. Harrison has no qualms at all about putting her readers through the ringer. This woman does not pull her punches and with this novel focusing more on the gang and Rachel's personal life, things get real, and they get real, real fast. As much as this is Rachel's story, it is also Al's and Ceri's as well. We finally get background info on them both and even Trent as well and so much is starting to make sense and come together. It truly was mind blowing how many twists and unexpected turns showed up and threw me for a loop once more. This series is definitely keeping me on my toes and I'm having a hard time not wanting to read them all in one go. I can't wait to see what Harrison has up her sleeve next. ...more As I said here Kim Harrison's Rachel Morgan series has replaced Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake series in my mind as top form in the genre of paranormal private investigators.

In this latest outing, she's upped the ante even more by not doing what Hamilton does as her series continues--to wit, regress her plots to the point where they are mere frames on which she hangs her torpidly overwritten soft-core pornography--but instead takes her character the other way. This 6th book of the series takes us along with Rachel as she discovers that there are consequences to living her life as she has been. That her actions have (and can) cause people to lose their lives. It's a breath of fresh air for a writer in this genre to show her readers that she can risk dealing more seriously with her audience. Ms. Harrison has decided that she can risk treating us to Rachel's maturing and in doing so treat us maturely. Thank you, Kim Harrison. ...more wow, i'd forgotten how much kim harrison could totally blow my brains out with her writing. i had been expecting anything but this, and i was actually beginning to think that trent and rachel might actually have a chance together when ceri confirmed who the baby belongs to. plus, i have a feeling minias will survive and become a love interest. there's been too much built up about him for him to just disappear like that, and maybe minias will seek rachel's protection now that newt is openly gunni wow, i'd forgotten how much kim harrison could totally blow my brains out with her writing. i had been expecting anything but this, and i was actually beginning to think that trent and rachel might actually have a chance together when ceri confirmed who the baby belongs to. plus, i have a feeling minias will survive and become a love interest. there's been too much built up about him for him to just disappear like that, and maybe minias will seek rachel's protection now that newt is openly gunning. i also have a niggling suspicion about who killed kisten, but i can't be sure yet on that either. my suspect DID say that he would do anything to come closer to ivy and rachel.. i still feel uncomfortable about the sexual tension (or is that what it is?) between rachel and ivy, and i hope rachel finds someone soon. not that she needs to be defined by a male protagonist, but i think it will solve some of her problems (among new ones, i'm sure). and she did say she wanted to have children.. but i was fully satisfied with the ending being what it is, because it may just be the only way to save both ivy and jenks. and in bargaining for information she can also learn about the kisten issue. there's so much to come that i absolutely can't wait for the next book. so many turns i didn't expect in here, and i'm glad she got rid of marshal. dude was really pissing me off. i'm still crossing my fingers on a chance of rachel x trent or rachel x minias though. trent because he simply seems so lonely all the time, and it's obvious he admires her (though by the end of this i don't know if that still applies). minias because he seems to conveniently come to her aid one too many times. he does show his demonic side in this book, but i think it's out of a vested interest in survival rather than outwardly wanting to harm. anyway, i can still see minias coming to rachel as an alternative to newt. but then this would turn into a whole LKH episode, huh? i guess not overly much, then, but kim harrison has such a way of making everything believable. i think she might even manage the love entourage crap if she put her hand to it. the woman weaves magic. i have no doubt that the next book is gonna be even better. ...more This was even better the second time around and it's one of my favourites in the series! I loved all the page time the demons got in this book. The ever after is seriously cool and I think demon society is really fascinating. So far I'm loving my re-read of this series. it's making everything else I read really pale in comparison. Luckily Rachel wasn't quite as annoying in this edition as she has been becoming. She was actually starting to grow up and take responsibilty for her actions and wasn't whining when things didn't go her way. In this story Rachel is being stalked by the demon \"Al\" and she has to find a way to stop him attempting to hurt her and her family whilst saving a elf race all at the same time. If you have been disheartened by previous books this one should hopefully pull you back into the series.

This volume picks up right after book 5, For a Few Demons More , which includes some shockers that I really don't want to mention here for anyone who hasn't read that one and it makes talking about ODW difficult without spoiling FFDM. ODW is similarly dense in twists, turns, and revelations. The official Hollows mailing list banned all discussion of it until six weeks after publication, an unprecedented move for the list. They opened the list for readers of advanced copies to everyone and moved any discussion of plot--or even reactions to the book as a whole--to there. So, with that caveat, I'll do my best to do this spoiler-free. I will mention things from the first chapter, which has been available in the paperback of FFDM and on Harrison's web site for several months, and anything from books 1-4 is fair game. I'll try to avoid major spoilers for book 5. ODW picks up where FFDM left off. Our protagonists are Rachel Morgan, witch and \"runner\" (PI-cum-\"fixer\") and her partners/roommates, Ivy (a vampire in love with Rachel and dealing with shakeups in the criminal underworld she's connected to and could choose to run if she pressed it) and Jenks (a roguish pixy who plays mediator and brings common sense to the team) and their assorted allies, friends, and regulars: the werewolf who has Rachel serve as on-paper Alpha Female of his pack, the elves-in-hiding Trent Kalamack (ally and enemy by turns), Ceri, and Quen, the mysterious witch across the street, and a by-the-book FIB (not a typo--FIB is not FBI) agent. Plus the three demons who have been harassing Rachel for books on end, now seemingly no longer restricted by the contracts that bound them and fighting desperately for their own lives, using Rachel as a bargaining chip. Oh, and her mom. Her mom's a major character in this one. And right there we see the major point of ODW. The series has always had a huge focus on family, both chosen and born. Rachel forms a family with her business partner and with a small werewolf pack, and recovers her ties to her blood family while driving herself to live up to her father's legacy. Ivy deals with the psychological damage the criminal and corrupt vampire community (run, like the agency that polices vampires, by her extended family) has done. Jenks fights from day one to protect his family against the day he dies, which is coming far too soon. And the elves are trying to rescue their whole species, which is so much in danger of dying that they've faked their own genocide to maintain their culture. So Rachel winds up having to work with her mother and reveal some of the dangers she faces in her daily life. In exchange, her mother reveals... well... quite a few things. Her mother is mostly doing well in this book; she has few of the lapses into confusion and dementia that have plagued her since her husband died and Rachel works to understand what her mother needs in her life, as well as leaning what her mother can do to help them both. Harrison is at her best when she focuses on the relationships between the characters(*) and how Rachel and Ivy are learning to connect with other people; this book has a lot of navel-gazing, but it's interesting navel-gazing and never gets in the way of the story. This is a book of revelations: secrets about Rachel's mother (and father) that go as deep as the ones revealed in books 1 and 2, secrets about the elves (although revelations about them are a staple of 5 of the 6 books), and even secrets about the demons. Harrison is revealing some of the history, convolutions, and even magical theory behind the Hollows. She's at her best when writing complex, interconnected storylines and pulling back the covers inch-by-teasing-inch(*). As the title suggests, the major action revolves around the demons. The \"outlaw demon\" is Big Al (her not-so-affectionate nickname for the demon who vexes her life the most), who was imprisoned in the last book for breaking laws and endangering all the demons' livelihood. Someone is summoning him out of the demons' custody and setting him free to do what he wants, which is to kill or kidnap Rachel. Rachel has to navigate demon politics (and legal system!), keep Al off her back, find the person summoning him and find out why s/he's doing it, and try to keep the deadly and enigmatic demon Newt from getting involved. And if she can learn something about why she is one of two witches in the world who can perform demonic magic along the way, all the better. On top of this, of course, Trent has \"urgent\" (and risky) business he'll cajole, threaten, or trick Rachel into doing for him. As usual. And, of course, deal with her family as her mom gets more involved than Rachel ever wanted. The book has the usual good action scenes--Harrison is at her best with the action(*)--with the chases, skulking, bluffing, magical attacks, and shoot-outs we've come to expect Rachel to get herself into. Every one makes sense and none get too long or convoluted. Harrison's writing on this has improved steadily across the series. We have the expected evolution of Rachel and Ivy's ongoing and messy relationship. It isn't as mesmerizing or intense as in the last two books and doesn't have the pyrotechnic writing of books one and five, but it works great and leads to a truly beautiful and heart-wrenching moment. As we saw in FFDM, Ivy is maturing emotionally at an amazing rate and we get a touching insight into her life, especially after the events in FFDM that turned her emotional life upside-down. So, net net. Is it a good book? Yes. Is it the best book in the series? Hard to say. It has the most information and advances the world story the furthest, but it's not the most \"detectivey,\" \"noir,\" or funny (although I wanted to read funny lines to my girlfriend all throughout, as usual; she forbade me to since they all had spoilers). If you're doing to read book 7, you have to read this one, of course, and you will enjoy doing so. It just may well have some of your favorite moments. * And I should clear one thing up. Kim Harrison is at her best when she's writing. At least, she is as a writer; I don't know about her personal life. The writing in this series started good, with moments of pyrotechnic genius, and it's just getting better as the characters and world settle in. ...more Happily into the ever-after. Oh my dear, sweet Rachel. Finally recognising her dangerous, risk taking ways and you end up right back where you started. But this time, instead of cursing at you loudly from my bed at midnight, I was right behind you. The fallout from the previous book was massive, with white witch Rachel and her vampire roommate and business partner, Ivy, having to come to terms with their overwhelming grief.

The fallout from the previous book was massive, with white witch Rachel and her vampire roommate and business partner, Ivy, having to come to terms with their overwhelming grief. While always in the back of their minds, this part of the story didn't seem to dominate, and I'm assuming that there is more to come. I won't even try to summarise the plot or anything, because there are so many threads, but also I don't want to spoil anything for those who have not read the previous books (which is a must!). But I will say that this addition to the series is more focused around demons and the ever-after than the vampires which dominated the last book. There are so many beings trying to kill Rachel, we just have to take them one at a time. It seemed like there were so many revelations in Where Demons Dare , and I imagine that Rachel was felt quite emotionally overwhelmed. The truth about her father, where witches came from, her being able to spindle demon magic, Ceri's pregnancy, and the threat she poses to the whole of the world. Rachel keeps on taking hit after hit, which I guess is why I was with her all the way at the end. Usually I would be screaming at her to make a proper plan, think about what she's going to do for one friggin' second, CALM THE HELL DOWN! But not this time. I wanted her to show everyone that she had this under control; that she was smart, strong, and not what everyone else thought of her. It was a powerful moment, and one that redeemed a lot about Rachel for me. So I dealt in demons. So the hell what. It didn't make me a bad person. Or stupid. Or rash. It made me dangerous to everyone around me is all. What I love about this series is the characters, which is becoming quite a cast of different people. There is Jenks, the pixy and Rachel's other business partner, Trent, Ceri and Quinn, the elves, Glen, the FIB officer, David, Rachel's pack-mate and resident alpha werewolf, Marshall, another witch and potential love interest, Kelsey, Rachel's neighbour who she just found out the true identity of, Rachel's mom (who is hilarious), Takata, the famous rock star with a secret link to Rachel, and then there are demons galore with Al, Minias, and Newt. But it is never confusing, never tedious. All of these people are important to Rachel (except the demons....she spends most of the book trying to get them away from her), and despite all these people, in a way she is still alone. She is one of a kind, in body and spirit, always with a mountain to climb, with a hell of a journey in front of her. Making deals with demons is never going to be easy, and just when Rachel thinks she may have the upper hand, she is pulled right back into the middle. But I think now that she is beginning to come to terms with what she is and what she can do, she will be all the stronger for it. I really enjoyed this addition to the series, and it is definitely one of the best so far. \"You can't forget anything,\" I said, watching the words vanish into nothing. \"And even if you do, it always comes back to bitch-slap you in the morning.\" ...more This series is still going strong, surprisingly. Generally I get bored of them by this point, but she's kept up the quality, expanded the world just enough & kept it strong, without adding a lot of extraneous gore or sex. Wow, so many twists and turns. Good one! This is the sixth book in the Rachel Morgan series. The demon Algaliarept is supposed to be imprisoned in the Ever-After, but someone has been summoning him nightly, putting Rachel and the ones she loves at risk. Rachel joins forces with Glenn from the FIB to find out who, while Ivy investigates a mystery left over from book 5.

This was a terrific read, although in some ways less satisfying to me than the earlier books. I wanted answers, and you do get a lot here---everything but the answer I wanted most! That missing answer is also connected to a plot thread I felt was kind of dropped, as though the author lost interest. Having said that, let me say that there were also a lot of things this book did better than earlier entries in the series. It's nice to have some interaction between Rachel and her actual family, in addition to the family of friends she has created. Rachel also becomes aware of how many people really care about her, which is especially nice in a series that has been full of uneasy alliances (I imagine, though, her relations with Trent Kalamack are always going to flip flop around). Rachel is growing up, and trying to leave her thrill-seeking behind her; her new method of reaching decisions is to believe if it feels right, it must be wrong. All in all, <+++>The Outlaw Demon Wails</+++> is an entertaining paranormal read which ties up some loose ends, but leaves enough hanging that I want to read the next book right now! ...more The Outlaw Demon Wails seems to be a bridge book in The Hollows series, and maybe that is why I thought this book was the weakest in the series. There are some resolutions to questions that have been building in the books, such as the Ivy/Rachel relationship and how exactly Rachel can do some of the things she does. Sadly, the book itself feels too long and has too many plot points that are superfluous or dropped. For instance, Rachel discovers that her father is not, in fact, her biological fat The Outlaw Demon Wails seems to be a bridge book in The Hollows series, and maybe that is why I thought this book was the weakest in the series.

Sadly, the book itself feels too long and has too many plot points that are superfluous or dropped. For instance, Rachel discovers that her father is not, in fact, her biological father. The point does not seem to add much to the series, except give Rachel more angst and a still alive father, perhaps making her more special in a sense because of it. While I understand that recaps are needed for new readers. The recaps in this book were too long and filled too much space. Additionally some characters, like Ivy, felt flat, and the term \u201chip cocked\u201d was used too much. Way too much. Happily, all the things that make the series good are still present, such as the humor and the fact that Rachel\u2019s powers have costs. Unlike some other series, power in The Hollows has a price, and even while Rachel becomes a little more powerful (perhaps simply more aware of her power) that too has a price, a heavy price. It is nice to see that in a book. Rachel herself also grows up and grows more aware. It was nice to see her mother have a larger role as well. Additionally, the paperback edition has a nice short story about Ceri. ...more I didn't know how I was going to make it through this book knowing that Kisten wouldn't be waiting for me on the pages.

Three months have passed for Rachel since the events of the last book & like me - she's having a little trouble moving forward with her life. She is trying, of course - but I don't blame her... I mean - how can you??? & naturally more circumstances completely beyond her control arise that push her to fall apart all over again. Poor girl just can't catch a break... Al is back and he is royally pissed off! He apparently blames Rachel for his in trouble in the ever-after and he plans on making her pay - big time! One of the things I've always liked about the Hollows is that there is never a shortage of new characters. In this book we are treated to several new characters, all more interesting then the next. Bis was a nice surprise and look forward to more of him. I think it's neat that Rachel has her own gargoyle now. I can't wait to see what kind of adventures this opens doors to! & now with Piscary out of the picture, we have the chance to learn more about the new master vampire, Rynn Cormel. As of now I don't think he's downright evil.... not like Piscary was, but this guy is definitely no push-over, that's for damn sure! Also, it was fun seeing more of Rachel's mom. After meeting her, it definitely goes a long way toward explaining why Rachel is the hot mess that she is. I loved her - so funny! I'm more then ready for Marshall to exit stage left. His whole white knight fetish is getting real old, real quick! Rachel is more than capable of taking care of herself - the last thing she needs is some hairless wonder playing at being her knight in shinning armor! & with that being said, Rachel really has grown up over these last few books. She's still a mess but now she's thinking before she acts. She's clearly starting a new phase in her life.... The events with Trent and the ever-after were interesting, I love him & Rachel together. & when they were roller skating together - *cue the girly sigh* because there definitely was one! Another awesome addition to Rachel Morgan's ongoing emotional rollercoaster & life of adventure! ...more I still haven't recovered from what happened to Kisten... and even though three months have passed for Rachel since the events of the last book, she hasn't either.

He's back and he is royally ticked off. The demon blames Rachel for the fact that he is in trouble in the ever-after and he plans on punishing her every time someone summons him out. And that has been happening with increasing frequency. In the meantime, Trent is back in her orbit. He wants her help to get a genetic sample from the elves in the ever-after. He believes if he gets an old enough sample, he can use it to genetically alter and save the future of his race... and Ceri's unborn child. This book is a lot more action oriented than most Hollows books. Usually, the character development puts the happenings of the story firmly in the backseat. That's not so here. Sure, we have some residual heartache over Kisten, some angst about Rachel's family history, and the ever-present will-they-or-won't-they with Ivy. But I was actually more wrapped up with the momentum of the action this time --and frankly, I was glad for it. After the emotional wringer Kim Harrison put me through last time, it was nice not to read the book through tears. We take a fantastic trip to the much-anticipated ever-after. We meet more demons and get an unexpected look inside their world. Plus a pretty big reveal as to why Rachel is so special and what that means for demon-kind. A great book that really moved the overall story forward and opens the doors for many new possibilities in the next installment. 5 stars ...more Is it bad that I am happy to be caught up???

Neste livro muito pouco acontece (tal como nos outros). Oh, abre com uma cena de a\u00e7\u00e3o intensa, com a Rachel e a m\u00e3e a fugirem do dem\u00f3nio Algaliarept, que est\u00e1 supostamente preso na dimens\u00e3o dos dem\u00f3nios mas que conseguiu soltar-se misteriosamente. \u00a0Rachel, Ivy e Jenks t\u00eam de viver com o facto de que podem ser atacados a toda a hora, o que os deixa... angustiados. Esta premissa poderia ter dado origem a um livro cheio de a\u00e7\u00e3o e mist\u00e9rio, mas como sempre, o mist\u00e9rio e a a\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o deixados para segundo plano e muito do livro \u00e9 passado em reflex\u00f5es cheias de ang\u00fastia por parte das personagens. Ap\u00f3s o ataque surpresa do in\u00edcio, muito pouco se passa, pois a Rachel j\u00e1 sabe mais ou menos o que anda a acontecer. Outra coisa que me come\u00e7a a irritar: a Rachel \u00e9 poderosa mas nunca faz nada. Nunca utiliza magia complexa (s\u00f3 invoca c\u00edrculos de prote\u00e7\u00e3o e pouco mais) e quando precisa de magia ou de planos vira-se para as outras personagens, nomeadamente a Ivy (com quem tem uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o tortuosa), o Jenks e a Ceri. O drama interior (e exterior) das personagens \u00e9 ao mesmo tempo um factor de irrita\u00e7\u00e3o constante, por se prolongar tanto no tempo e por ser um tema demasiado central e algo que d\u00e1 complexidade \u00e0s personagens porque, no fundo, elas s\u00e3o bastante carism\u00e1ticas e humanas. No geral: continuo a n\u00e3o perceber muito bem porque gosto tanto desta s\u00e9rie, mas acho-a interessante.

Mas se n\u00e3o se importam com um enredo mais simplista, um mundo que evolui muito lentamente e uma hist\u00f3ria que \u00e9 conduzida mais pelas personagens do que por qualquer outro elemento, penso que esta \u00e9 uma s\u00e9rie de que v\u00e3o gostar. ...more One of the best things about the Hollows series is how real the characters and situations feel, sure there are vampires, elves, werewolves, pixies, demons, witches, you name it and it can appear yet it's still realistic in a way that makes me feel as if everything I read has happened and it all becomes part of my memories.

I read them sparingly, savoring the thought of still having a Harrison book I haven't read but the moment I'm done my hand wants to grab the next, it's very, very tough to stop myself at that point...that said, I can't recommend these enough for fans of good, juicy reading, I'm definitely hooked and always look forward to more from one of my favorite authors. The sixth's book has all of our favorite black and white ( and sometimes grey) characters back; Ivy, Jenks, Trent, Dave, Al, Minas, Ceri, Rachel's mom Alice, Kinsley and some newcomers, there's even a gargoyle and a new master vampire, Rynn Cormel. As usual there is tension between the good and the bad guys, Rachel's problems seems to be bound to demons these days, they just won't leave her alone... Her smut and demon marks are tagging on her soul, making her the target for scary apparitions that are hungry for her demise. In order to save herself and her friends she must plunge into the lion's den, on top of that there's the Ivy and blood sharing tension at home which gets some resolution and a potential new romantic interest, which so far seems pretty normal, phew! I loved the way Trent and Rachel still continue to bicker, they work together, then they hate each other, then they try to help, back and forth while building up tension and entertainment, you never know what to expect but let me just say it keeps the juice flowing, that's for sure. Rachel always has enough strength and love inside to do the right thing, even if it kills her, and something tells me she's getting closer and closer to that dark end. The good new is that the girl doesn't give up and I like that she's vulnerable, not some perfect super hero who can defeat any obstacle, that's not interesting, the struggles and the hard earned wins are interesting, at least to me. I also found the language and descriptions to be more luminous, there was a sparkle and warmth, wonderful depictions of the places and people, feelings and scents. It gave the pages extra luster and made the book a nice read, not just a romp through hell and its inhabitants. I definitely took my time reading this one, I can read a book in one sitting but this was savored over a few days, the ending was especially wonderful, I was on pins and needles for the last 50 pages! This was truly a feast for the eyes, can't wait to dive back in! ...more I finally finished The Outlaw Demon Wails this evening, and I must say Kim Harrison has done it again.

We find out about Rachel's true heritage and learn more about her parents. We see more of Rachel and Ivy working through their blood balance. This is shown in a scene where I had to put the book down, and walk away from the intensity of it for a moment. There is also a possible new love interest in Rachel's future when Marshall (the witch from Mackinaw Island) appears on her church's front steps. The Elves (Ceri, Quen, and Trent) are also heavily focused on as they try to save their species. All of The Hollows characters slip in and out of the story. Even though they are not on the front burner, their presence is shown and their support for our favorite trio is evident. Like when David stops by to lend Rachel his duster, or when Keasley comes to Rachel's aid, yet again. We even learn more about the mysterious rockstar Takata! Diving into the Ever-After was a suspenseful scene, and a scary view into the world where the Demons lurk. Kim describes this run down wasteland with such detail, that I can just taste the burnt amber in the back of my throat, and feel the murky air all over. I was nervous to visit the Ever-After, and now I'm excited to learn that we will be going back in the future. Of course it will be on our own terms next time! Jenks as always lends his hysterical one liners, and witty banter with our girls and enemies. He manages to save the day once or twice, and he also has a new tenant in the church, a Gargoyle named Bis. There is still talk of Matalina's illness, and you can feel the pain every time it is mentioned. One can only hope that she will survive through the series. I hate to give anything away, but I feel it has been out long enough that I can post this very minor spoiler. It was really refreshing when I got to the end of the book and realized that there was no sex at all. The story didn't need it to push along the plot, and it definitely wasn't time for Rachel to take that step with anyone so soon after her loss from For a Few Demons More. The story has fantastic dialogue that keeps you glued to the pages. (I understand it's not a big spoiler, but some people might be miffed about the lack of sex in the book. Yeah, I'm talking about you Rachel and Ivy worshippers!) Overall this is the best book in the series so far. I don't know how Kim will top it (I've said that before), but I have faith that she will. The Hollows just sucks you in, and once you're there you never want to leave. If you haven't already, get out there and buy the book! If you haven't started this series I suggest you hop to it! ...more I thought it was amazing to read Big Al and Ceri's back story. Oh how far he's come since then!

That's the least of the surprises when it comes to potential for children in this series. The highlights of this book for me were her interactions with Trent as well as their trip into the ever-after. While he's still a murdering bastard, we do see his walls crumbling a little bit, which only really happens around Rachel for those not in his immediate trusted group of friends and guardians. The plot surrounding the Ever-After was fantastic as well. We meet a new sidekick for Rachel, a young gargoyle named Bis. He's so ugly, he's almost cute! I also really enjoyed learning about the demon society a bit more. As I've said in previous reviews for this series, it makes the villains so much more dynamic when we can see these parts to them. Demons have their own rules and laws in the Ever-After. While they are ruthless, it's within their own civilization. To add to that, Kim likes to make Trent really experienced at random activities. We learn that he can drive a stick at the end of Book 2. We learn that he can swim very well in Book 3. Here we learn that he can (view spoiler) [roller skate of all things. (hide spoiler) ] It's just some of the qualities that add to the richness of this series as a whole. This is my favorite urban fantasy series by far, so I highly recommend reading it. While not every book is as good as the next, this one is one of the best ones. http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DDK1QM... ...more I really don\u2019t know what to write in this review. Amazing? Brilliant? Awesome? There are not enough words to describe this book! Kim Harrison\u2019s talent is beyond words and this book is the perfect example of an urban fantasy story! It\u2019s not easy for a series to be so good after the first books, but this one keeps getting better and better with each installment! In this book, nothing is easy for Rachel. Secrets come to surface and she learns many harsh truths about herself. But whatever happens to I really don\u2019t know what to write in this review. Amazing? Brilliant? Awesome?

Secrets come to surface and she learns many harsh truths about herself. But whatever happens to her, her first priority is her friends and family to be good and safe and that\u2019s why I respect her so much. The story is full of action and to many OMG moments! Rachel is one of my favorite characters in an urban fantasy books. She\u2019s authentic, she does her fair share of mistakes but she does a fine job saving the day! I found her more mature in this book. She was thinking before acting and she didn\u2019t make hasty decisions. As always, I loved all the secondary characters for different reasons everyone! Jenks, Ivy, Ceri, Quen and Trent. Yes, I said Trent. He and Rachel are having problems as always but for a reason I think that they would be an amazing couple. If they don\u2019t kill each other first, of course! I am very curious about their future! I don\u2019t have to say that my personal favorite is Jenks! It\u2019s easy to guess if you read the book! Despite his small size, he\u2019s brave and the best pixy ever! So, this was another amazing read and I can\u2019t wait to read the rest of the books! I recommend it to all the fans of urban fantasy! ...more I'm not actually sure where to begin this review. There were a lot of revelations in this book that will have far-reaching effects on the books that follow it. It was definitely a turning point in the series. If you're looking for Rachel to find a new love interest, sorry, it doesn't happen in this book. I'm not entirely sure I *like* the way the book ended- but it's got me intrigued enough to continue on. I can't help wondering, though, if Harrison is starting to write herself into a corner.

The changes in Rachel Morgan are significant due to her revelations, and those of us who want our heroines to remain \"good\" are starting to squirm in our seats a little. Now-- I feel it is very important to note this-- Morgan is NOT doing a complete 180 in moral values here, but she is changing. A good dynamic character changes based on experiences, etc. I'm just not sure I like HOW she's changing... ...more 4.5 Wow lots of things going on and many I didn't see coming. This was a great addition to the series. Rachel with all her demon drama, trying to figure out her abilities and exactly where they come from. I'm wondering where Marshall will fit in and if we will see more of how him. I'm definitely interested in what happens next for Rachel and company.", "Title": "The Outlaw Demon Wails"},
