Mr. Albom-Winfrey seems to think the mass marketing of Harry Potter has ruined the theoretical lives of such figures as Winnie the Pooh, Clifford, Curious George, etc., despite that his own shitty books have been thrust upon the world under the same kind of marketing blitz. As if I weren't annoyed enough at his article, I was subsequently reminded of this little novel, which I read over a few weeks while I was dating a girl; it was in her room, and whenever I found myself there, being bored, I would pick up the thing and read it for a while.<---F> Here's the deal</---F>. I'm not sure if Mr. Albom is trying to help me, or stun me, or just bring a flood of tears to fall on the pages, but I am positive that whatever he's trying to do, he sucks at it. Immensely. There's nothing like one-sentence paragraphs to instill the right amount of melodrama. Sure, his plot is sort of intriguing, but that's not too surprising. I'm pretty sure if I wrote a book called \"THE FIVE PEOPLE WHO WILL FELLATE YOU AND CHEW OFF YOUR FACE AFTER YOU DIE,\" people would be curious enough to read on. Anybody can think of some kind of \"5 people\" list and turn it into a passable book; I'm willing to bet that 75% of all the people in the world could do it with less corny, Hallmark Brand melodramatic stupid shit. It's like Mr. Albom suddenly realized he would get laid so much more by pretending to be emotionally available, and now he's suddenly the Josh Groban of authors. If you enjoyed this book, you're emotionally weak. If you have some sort of affection for Mitch Albom, you're a middle-aged housewife starved from any male emotional output. God do I hate this motherfucker. ...more \"Lost love is still love, <---C>Eddie</---C>. It just takes a different form, that's all. You can't hold their hand... You can't tousle their hair...

I vaguely remember when exactly I read this but I remember I read this couple of months before I \"Lost love is still love, Eddie. It just takes a different form, that's all. You can't hold their hand... You can't tousle their hair... But when those senses weaken another one comes to life... Memory... Memory becomes your partner. You hold it... you dance with it... Life has to end, Eddie... Love doesn't.\" The book that taught me the idea of death, God and life's never ending unanswered questions. I vaguely remember when exactly I read this but I remember I read this couple of months before I broke up with my current-boyfriend and it was around the end of the year. Maybe September-October to November. It is significant to know when I read because it is one of the reasons why this book just stays in my mind. I pictured myself as Eddie. An old man with so many bruises (<---B>physically and emotionally</---B>) draging the last breath he had to carry before he died and saved a little girl's life. With a cause he died (which for me is amazing!) and the sky went darker like any scene we might see in movies or stories about the long tunnel after we are no longer connected to this life and earth (classic - but I kinda fond of this typical scene). Then he met the five people that bumped into his life for a second and even for a lifetime that he might didn't remember or know them before when he was alive. These five people were there to answer all of his unanswered questions about his life and why God had purposes with him in his life even when he thought that he had no value at all - This too amazes me still; have you EVER wondered why are you here on earth? why God made you so grand that He let you breath-eat-work-smoke-have sex-make decision-go crazy-fall in love-make mistakes-cheat-be bad-curse-etc? doesn't that make you feel so little to know that now?) And the story evolved from there. And all the classic questions that I believe WE all are facing now are written so nicely by Albom. With jokes, with poems, with simple everyday words. Albom didn't preach within this book which I think it is the risk of writing such subject - and the fact that he didn't preach makes it universal for all races and religions to read. And be spiritually touched. And so how does this effect on me with the broke-up? Highly emmense. I was angry all the time and didn't understand why I was treated so bad by a man and how I thought I have not a value to go on. Then a friend's death which rolled me back to the time I read this book in the first place reminds me of how life goes on (and how life NEEDS to go on). God has purposes with us, even if it means only to be a bell-boy of a grand hotel, or to be a mistress, or to be a virgin queen or to be an ordinary guy standing on the train station. Little things matter the most. On the account of this book, I got to know that Albom had written another grand book about life-death-God previously before this book. I haven't read the previous one; Tuesday with Morrie (which led to a movie), so I am really looking forward to read it after reading this. I hope that book will be highly amazing and enlight me like Five People did. ...more I don't understand the one star reviews for the book.

Mitch Albom has a gift of words, and to give a biased rating is to behave no better than the author itself - to dislike something not based on its own merits, but because of its reputation. I have equal love for the Harry Potter books and for The Five People You Meet in Heaven , and am proud to say neither HP's popularity nor Albom's notoriety had a say in how I felt for them. I highly recommend this book, particularly if you're one into bittersweet life lessons and notions of death. Some have accused the book for being both preachy and boring, but I don't find that the case. ...more One of the great things about checking out audiobooks from the public library is that I can take a chance on something I normally wouldn't buy, and I end up loving it. And then, of course, there are the times I take a chance on something I wouldn't normally like and end up really hating it as predicted.

And then, of course, there are the times I take a chance on something I wouldn't normally like and end up really hating it as predicted. See if you can guess which is the case here by the end of this post. The Five People You Meet in Heaven is about Eddie, an amusement park maintenance guy who dies and goes to heaven. Spoiler alert, I guess, though you could probably figure that out from the title. From there he meets five people whose lives touched his and learns why he was such a unique and special little snowflake while on Earth. The book's main shortcoming is that I only get to enjoy seeing something kill Eddie on one occasion. And that was over within the first few pages. Seriously, this thing is so ham-fisted in its moralizing, so infused with cliches, so sentimental, and so naked in its attempts to manipulate emotions that I only finished it because it was blessedly short. The worst part about this last point is that the audiobook brings up violins --VIOLINS!-- in the background at the most supposedly sentimental parts. Which is to say, constantly. Oh, and Albom apparently never heard of the \"show, don't tell\" rule when it comes to establishing character and showing reactions. I guess everyone in Heaven describes their mental processes in flagrant detail. There's also the issue of proclamations that sound wise at first, but crumble under any amount of thought. For example, there's a line to the effect of \"Sometimes, when you sacrifice something you don't lose it. You just give it to someone else.\" Now, I haven't a dictionary in front of me to help me through this moral morass, but I fail to see the difference off the top of my head. At any rate, I certainly wouldn't recommend this. If you really want to read a good book about the afterlife, pick up Dante's The Divine Comedy, read the first few pages, then throw it down in frustration and decide that there's no good middle ground. ...more My face tightens into a mean spirited frown, I grind my teeth, my head starts to burn, I clench my fists, I begin to tremble; there is a tightness in my stomach.

I run to the lake and dive in, scraping my head and arms. The lake is not deep; I stand up. I am covered in mud and Chordata feces. I decide to drown myself. Head deep, slipping away, I am pulled up.

Book Review On The Five People You Meet In Heaven The Five People You Meet In Heaven By Mitch Albom 208pp Passaic, New Jersey ISBN-13: 9781401308582 Hyperion $10.80 This book was so amazing that it remained on the New York Best Seller List for 95 weeks. If the book wasn\u2019t that marvelous why would it have remained there? Mitch Albom\u2019s book The Five People You Meet In Heaven is an extraordinary book. You might think it\u2019s a religious book because the title itself, but it isn\u2019t. It is a captivating book that deals with fait, death, and how everything you do affects someone else. I found myself comparing little choices or decisions I made to the ones Eddie, the main character made. I\u2019m not into books about heaven or death but I found myself loving every minute of it. I found myself gasping, crying, and laughing with the characters because of the way Mitch Albom portrays Eddie is so moving. If you want a good fiction book, this is a MUST read! Eddie is a character who is alone in life, no family, no friends, just his job at the amusement park as janitor. It breaks your heart how alone he is. It\u2019s so poignant the way it is written that it makes you want to befriend the aged lonely man. The way the book starts is like the saying the end is only a new beginning. The beginning is the tragic, horrifying death of Eddie, and the death, or end, is only the beginning to his afterlife and the entry to heaven. The book puts such new perspectives on life to you and gives you knowledge of how to live life to the fullest. So many quotes can apply to your life, or help you out. For example Ruby, one of the five people Eddie meets in heaven, says to Eddie \u201cHolding anger is a poison...It eats you from inside...We think that by hating someone we hurt them...But hatred is a curved blade...and the harm we do to others...we also do to ourselves...\u201d I personally love that quote because it help me let go of things because I was filled with anger. I learned to let go, appreciate what you have and to have faith. The book is like having a mentor or role model who teaches you how to deal. While reading the book you find yourself astound on how every little thing one does can alter someone\u2019s life. Take Eddie for example. He is playing ball in the street, when the blue man is in a car. Eddie drops the ball, and chases it into the street where the blue man suddenly has a heart attack due to the scare he is facing of hitting this little boy in the street. Eddie goes through so much in the book. With deaths of every one he loves, to his own death in the very first chapter. He has to learn to accept death, fait, letting go, there are no random acts in life, and that love always wins! The way he learns is so amazing because he is so realistic, he\u2019s a kind, old, and he would sacrifice himself for others. The way Albom shows this it makes you feel like you know him, to me I felt as if he was my grandfather. Essentially this book is a must read whether you believe in heaven or not. I guarantee you will be moved by this book. There is even a movie too! One thing you will wonder after you finish reading this book is who will be your five people you meet in heaven? ...more \u0645\u0646\u0630 \u0645\u062f\u0629

He dies trying to save a little girl at the amusement park he worked as a maintenance man. After he dies, he meets 5 people who actually show him his life had meaning. Eddie, didn\u2019t believe he was worth anything. He thought his life meant nothing. He first meets a man he accidently helped die after the man almost kills him with a car. The second one he meets is his captain in the army. He helps him understand what actually happened while he was fighting in the war. Captain shot eddie\u2019s knee to keep him from entering a burning building that they set after they escaped from their captors. Eddie entered the burning building because he thought he saw a little kid in there. The third person is the woman who the amusement park was named after. She wanted Eddie to see the good in what Eddie did. She also helped him forgive his father after seeing the real man he was. The fourth person he meets is his wife. He loved her and only her. After she died of cancer, he never loved again. She showed him how much that really meant to her. The fifth person was the little girl who actually was in the burning building during the war. So he wasn\u2019t losing his mind. This was a surprise ending. And you also found out he saved the little girl at the amusement park. And his life did have meaning. Because of how well he did his job, always making sure the rides were safe. Looking out for the kids, his life really did have value. One by one, these mostly unexpected characters remind him that we all live in a vast web of interconnection with other lives; that all our stories overlap; that acts of sacrifice seemingly small or fruitless do affect others; and that loyalty and love matter to a degree we can never fathom. This book brought tears to my eyes. It is definitely one of the good ones ...more Very powerful. Similar in tone and emotion with his novel Tuesdays with Morrie . I think that the greatest achievement of this story is the dreamlike, subconscious mood and setting the author creates. He can get a bit syrupy, but not too bad to make this contextually a problem. Albom raises some interesting, thought provoking questions and leaves some unanswered, which makes for a better read, especially considering the subject. This was okay but not as good as either The First Phone Call from Heaven or The Time Keeper . It was a pleasant enough story but it failed to really engross me in the various happenings. Partly I think I found it an extremely weird idea of what Heaven might be like. The five people seemed a strange collection to me and I could understand if Eddie felt a bit miffed by who he got! I must admit I started thinking who I might want for my five people .........

learned that we affect other people's lives however small we do to others. :D Buku yang bagus terutama bagi yang suka memaknai dan menghargai Hidup, membuat kita untuk selalu bersyukur kepada Sang Pencipta. Pelajaran 1: Tidak ada kehidupan yang sia-sia. Satu-satunya waktu yang kita sia-siakan adalah waktu yang kita habiskan dengan mengira kita hanya sendirian. Pelajaran 2: Pengorbanan bagian dari kehidupan, bukan untuk disesali jika mengorbankan sesuatu yang berharga, karena kita tidak sungguh-sungguh kehilangan itu, Kita hanya meneruskannya pada orang lain. Pelajaran 3: MAAF. Buku yang bagus terutama bagi yang suka memaknai dan menghargai Hidup, membuat kita untuk selalu bersyukur kepada Sang Pencipta. Pelajaran 1: Tidak ada kehidupan yang sia-sia. Satu-satunya waktu yang kita sia-siakan adalah waktu yang kita habiskan dengan mengira kita hanya sendirian. Pelajaran 2: Pengorbanan bagian dari kehidupan, bukan untuk disesali jika mengorbankan sesuatu yang berharga, karena kita tidak sungguh-sungguh kehilangan itu, Kita hanya meneruskannya pada orang lain. Pelajaran 3: MAAF. Karena menyimpan rasa marah adalah racun. Kita berpikir kebencian merupakan senjata untuk menyerang orang yang telah menyakiti kita. Tapi kebencian adalah pedang bermata dua, luka yang kita buat dengan pedang bermata dua, luka yang kita buat dengan pedang itu, kita lakukan juga pada diri kita sendiri. Jadi belajarlah me-MAAF-kan terutama me-MAAF-kan diri kita sendiri. Pelajaran 4: Cinta seperti Hujan, bisa menyuburkan dari atas, menghujani pasangan dengan keceriaan. Tapi kadang-kadang dalam panasnya kehidupan, cinta seolah kering dipermukaan dan harus tergantung pada akarnya yang tertanam dalam untuk membuatnya tetap hidup. Cinta yang hilang tetap cinta, bentuknya saja yang berbeda yaitu berupa Kenangan, kehidupan boleh berakhir tapi cinta tidak. Pelajaran 5: \" Tidxk xdx kehidupxn yxng six-six. Sxtu-sxtunyx wxktu yxng kitx six-sixkxn xdxlxh wxktu yxng kitx hxbiskxn dengxn mengirx kitx hxnyx sendirixn\". Kita mungkin dapat membaca dan mengerti paragraf diatas dengan mudah meskipun huruf \"A\" diganti dengan huruf \"X\", tapi terasa bedakan? Nah dari itu kita bisa ambil kesimpulan seberapa kecilnya peran kita dan bisa digantikan , tetaplah kita membuat suatu perbedaan yang berarti bagi dunia. Maka mulai sekarang belajar BERSYUKUR terhadap apapun yang terjadi terhadap kita. Oke, Selamat membaca Teman-Teman! ...more This is just the most awful book I have ever read. I hate this book!

On his birthday, I read this at Christmas but frankly after eating too many roasted vegetables, drinking too much merlot and making myself a comfortable nest out of discarded wrapping paper, I was disinclined to write a review. It's now six months later and I think I've finally worked off the last roasted potato so this seems like a timely juncture to write a review of The Five People You Meet in Heaven. Eddie works at the amusement park on the Ruby Pier. He's 83 and probably due for retirement. On his birthday, our ever benevolent Lord / Fate decides that it's time for Eddie to take permanent retirement and so he is killed off in a freak fairground accident. Eddie's life force is not wasted though, as he spends his last moments attempting to rescue a little girl. And that is most definitely not a spoiler! Come on people, the books is called The Five People You Meet in Heaven which kind of presupposes that the protagonist is going to mostly be dead for a large part of the book. Really, it's not like heaven is the kind of place you go on a day trip unless you're Sam and Dean Winchester in an episode of Supernatural. So Eddie is now Deaddie and can get on with meeting his five people. I'm not sure why the number five was chosen for this novel... convention has it that six is the magic number in this kind of life-algorithm with the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon having been scientifically proven. Perhaps the sixth person that Eddie was fated to meet was Kevin Bacon... we'll never know. All five people have come into and out of Eddie's life during formative moments and have been affected by the very act of their meeting. None of the people might have struck Eddie as being particularly significant at the time and perhaps the events did not stand out as times which altered the direction of his existence but ultimately they've all led him to stand beneath that toppling ride car at the age of 83 thereby allowing him to save the life of a child. If I were a deeper thinking mammal I make take the opportunity to consider who the five people I might meet in heaven would be. But I'm not a deep thinking mammal so we'll just pass swiftly over that option for digression. This is an easy-to-read story with a well written collection of short stories (vignettes of Eddies life) strung together behind the vehicle of his death (metaphorical not literal). It was gently appealing, perhaps even charming, without being schmaltzy and held my attention for the half day or so it took to read it. At no point did I feel the need to stick my finger in my mouth and make retching noises... always a positive sign. Perhaps not the most uplifting of all potential holiday reads but if it leaves you feeling tearful when you put it down, at least there should be a substantial amount of festive booze around to help bolster your spirits. ...more This book is very imaginative I'll give the author that much at least.

Don't get me wrong, the story was very creative and it made you think, but he wrote so poetically it was hard for the words not to sink into your soul. The story was about a old crippled man named Eddie. Eddie worked at an amusement park called Ruby Pier and he was the head maintenance worker. The book starts on the day of his death. There was this little girl in the amusement park and her mom had left her alone so she could go on the rides with only her boyfriend and not her daughter. There was this ride at Ruby Pier called Freddy's Free Fall and it is one of those rides that you're at the top of a really tall pole and it just let's the cart drop and it's really fast until something catches it and you slow down right at the very end. So anyway, as Eddie is doing his rounds Freddy's Free Fall breaks and the cable is starting to snap (but nobody knows this yet) and there are people at the top and Eddie goes and tells his co-worker to get the people out of the cart and then to let the cart drop. But then as his coworker has gotten everyone out of the cart and preparing to let it drop Eddie realizes that it's the cable and if they let the cart drop, the cable will snap and it will fall off its tracks into the crowd of people that had formed below. Eddie tries to yell to his coworker but he doesn't hear him and so Eddie yells to the crowd to get back. The people listen...all except for the little girl. So as his coworker lets the cart down Eddie runs to save her but as soon as the cart falls on him, he feels two little hands in his. He doesn't know if he saves her. Then he has to go to heaven and meet five people that will explain to him about his life. I think this book was very inspiring. I was surprised at the ending and I thought that is was very good. I just really enjoyed reading Mitch Albom's work mainly I think because of the poetry. It was written in a very captivating style. I think that my favorite phrase that the author used was to describing Eddie. \"...this was who he was and who he would always be, a man with sand in his shoes in a world of mechanical laughter and grilled frankfurters.\" Mechanical laughter and grilled frankfurters. This book should be read by anyone and everyone and although it is not very religious, it really made me think about life and life after death. VERY GOOD READ! ...more It\u2019s interesting seeing how heaven is perceived in someone else\u2019s eyes. I do believe there is an afterlife of some sort, but I don\u2019t know what exactly lies there.

Furthermore, they explain to you about your purpose, destiny, and their involvement in you. This made me think about how it is true, there are many circumstances which affect your life. Every action made affects someone else and vice versa. This would be an ideal \u201cend\u201d (or a new beginning) to someone\u2019s life, especially if the person feels useless or felt as if they lived without a purpose. In my opinion, this would be a pleasant way to receive closure. In addition to that, you may have unanswered questions and it would be great if they would be answered. Sometimes we wonder about certain life events and seek answers, but only to find they aren\u2019t able to be resolved. Hearing someone else\u2019s point of view on why you should feel worthy and loved is very much enlightening. The writing in this novel was structured well and was very direct. I wish more books had this style of writing. I was satisfied by how the life events that occurred in Eddie\u2019s life were explained. You could really feel as if it you were living them alongside of him. At least that is how I felt. Whether if they were tragic or happy moments, they were realistic. Everyone has a life story and in some way we\u2019re interconnected to each other. The life events of everyone may not be as extreme as his (or may be worse), but I think they're just as significant. I can easily say that this is a therapeutic novel that will help a person who is filled with sadness and feelings of unworthiness feel better. It surely made me feel great and refreshed afterwards! This is also a short book which can be read in a small amount of time (depending on the person), so this can easily be one of those \u201cread again\u201d novels. I also heard Mitch Albom\u2019s novel \u201cTuesdays with Morrie\u201d is another well written book too, so I will be checking that one out sometime. I am highly impressed by this book and author. Every life matters and we are all here for a reason. ...more Not at all my normal fare, but it was a last thing at night read. I am a sceptic, so again this would not be a book that would attract me; it\u2019s not that I like the idea of the cessation of existence at death, but I think that\u2019s what happens. So how come I read this? Occasionally I buy books at auction because they can be very cheap; this came with assorted others, so ended up on the shelves. It\u2019s very brief and could easily be read in one sitting and is about a fairground worker called Eddie. It Not at all my normal fare, but it was a last thing at night read.

It\u2019s very brief and could easily be read in one sitting and is about a fairground worker called Eddie. It isn\u2019t much of a spoiler to say that Eddie dies at the beginning of the book. He then meets five people all linked to his life in some way who help him make sense of it all. Albom is an interesting character; I knew little about him prior to this, apart from the fact he has spent years grumbling about the Harry Potter books and films because he felt they made children stop reading other children\u2019s classics. And here\u2019s me thinking Harry Potter was just another English middle class, public school story! He has a column in the Detroit Free Press where he rants a bit about modern life (he also crosses picket lines, but that is a different story!) Back to the book; the reviews are mixed and it appears to be loved and hated (possibly by Harry Potter fans!) in equal measure. I can understand why; there is a lot of sentimentality and clich\u00e9 (all endings are also beginnings; holding anger is a poison) and Albom has a habit of explaining thought processes and ideas in great detail which can irritate. There\u2019s not a great deal to say about it; some people will love it and will find it comforting (most people want to believe everything will be ok in the end and we will see our loved ones again) and others will find it sentimental and irritating. Atheists probably shouldn\u2019t read books about heaven! Anyway I\u2019ve also heard it said that heaven is whatever you conceive it to be. Therefore here is mine. Heaven is a library with all the books ever published. Everyone subscribing to this heaven has their own personal space. Mine would have an open fire, be lined with books (of course), have a good armchair and there would be excellent food available at all times. There would be communal spaces to talk about books, watch film or TV if you wished and first class coffee. There would be a few other tweaks, but that is the essence. ...more Extreme simplification, ridiculous writing style, nonsense. Honestly, whatever this author was trying to do, whether making me cry tears of blood, philosophy over the meaning of life, or discover my connection with those around me, but he failed miserably at all of them. How on the history of time was this book on the Bestseller list for over ninety weeks? I weep for humanity. I initially gave this book 4/5 stars but I have since moved it down to 3/5 stars. I thought it was a good read but I now feel that I wouldn\u2019t read it again. The story centres around an elderly man who dies at the beginning of the book. The man goes to heaven and there he meets with five different people. These people have different connections to his life, some of them he knows and some of them he has never knowingly met before.

Mitch Albom gave an interesting perspective on what may happen to us once we die and the story as a whole made me consider things a little more deeply. Reflecting back on the book know I don\u2019t feel I really connected to the characters but I would still recommend to anyone who may be interested \u2013 it was a very quick read! \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 ...more seperti buku2 Mitch Albom lainnya, di buku ni alur ceritanya pun maju mundur..mungkin ni ciri khasnya..oiya diantara babnya pasti ada tulisan2 khusus di masa lampau.. *gw suka gaya lo..hihihi..* sesuai dengan judul bukunya, Eddie, Sang tokoh utama menemui 5 orang di alam baka setelah kematiannya itu..dan setiap orang yg ia temui memberikan satu pelajaran kepada Eddie..

And now it's been three months and I still think about this book and its beautiful meaning and it's only fair if I give it four. I'll definitely be re-reading this soon. I didn\u2019t read this book when everyone was in love with it, cheering it, championing its readability, its imagination, its magical splendor. Nor did I read it when the inevitable backlash kicked in, when it was accused of being trite, overly sentimental manipulative dreck, one of the worst books to be foisted upon Western literature. The fervor has since died down on both sides and at last this book found its way to me. Which side would I fall on? Well I must be a sentimentalist, for I just absol I didn\u2019t read this book when everyone was in love with it, cheering it, championing its readability, its imagination, its magical splendor.

The fervor has since died down on both sides and at last this book found its way to me. Which side would I fall on? Well I must be a sentimentalist, for I just absolutely loved it. I thought it resonated with profound emotion and insight into the human condition. Humans aren\u2019t that complicated, but we sure do have a way of making things so. A life lived is filled to the brim of hurt feelings, misunderstandings, misplaced grudges \u2026 we carry the burden of guilt over things we had no control over to begin with. Always, we seem confused by life and our place in it, plagued by pernicious doubts about what we didn\u2019t do, what we failed to try, to say, to give. Mitch Albom\u2019s version of heaven is a wondrous, engaging concept \u2013 without being preachy or overtly recognizable as any particular faith. I appreciated that. If we\u2019re lucky, we all believe in something, and it will be that something that waits for us when our life on this particular plane is through. Who would my five people be, and what they would teach me? Several passages that I loved: It is because the human spirit knows, deep down, that all lives intersect. That death doesn\u2019t just take someone, it misses someone else, and in the small distance between being taken and being missed, lives are changed (48). Young men go to war. Sometimes because they have to, sometimes because they want to. Always, they feel they are supposed to. This comes from the sad, layered stories of life, which over the centuries have seen courage confused with picking up arms, and cowardice confused with laying them down (57). ...more The book, The Five People you Meet in Heaven, is about a man named Eddie, that on his 83rd birthday, got killed in a tragic accident at an amusement park, trying to save a little girl.

And, OK, I only read about fifteen pages, but that was enough. You don't have to eat 130 bowls of shredded wheat to know that you can't stand it. And I actually sort of liked his book about the old guy, and I guess his dog book is probably pretty awesome and all, but, oh man, this book, excruciating... for fifteen pages...but, really, that's a pretty good chunk of this.", "Title": "The Five People You Meet in Heaven"},
