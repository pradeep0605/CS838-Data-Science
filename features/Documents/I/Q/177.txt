South Africans walking to the beat of hyphenated identities, flow and stutter, bounce and glide, at the mercy of beauty and ruthlessness\u2026 Gordimer's ear to the ground heard this as it heard the sweet cadences of Ibrahim's unaccustomed English and the mashed jerkiness of Julie's cosmopolitan consciousness. The style! Attractively typeset to soften the mess all these pauses and interjections make of the page, it rushes, it breaks, it drives along like we're in bad traffic, the enervated tailbacks of the millennial mind. I think that white authors need to write diverse books, so props. It's hard to do because you don't want to continue the long crappy tradition of speaking for people you've prevented from speaking for themselves, taking the place of people you've disenfranchised. Before I even start I think, why am I writing this, I should leave it to people of colour to write about themselves... and here we go round the mulberry bush. Anyway, no matter how carefully and subtly it's done, having a brown guy from a Muslim country end up being an agent of regressive patriarchy while a white woman's freedom and superior judgement (<---B>or is it?</---B>) carrying the day feels problematic. What's this superior judgement about? That's what's really interesting, the lifeways and worldviews on offer to a economically privileged white woman in South Africa end up seeming equally spiritually unsatisfactory. There's entry into the heartless hypercapitalist overclass, or the soulless camaraderie of rootless hipsters. Confronting the desert, Julie meets a silence so sweet it melts into poetry in her eyes and mind, it speaks to something buried, transforms her. She responds to the lure of a life of cooperation and mutuality with an expanded family and in communication with the land; she finds the rhythm her soul can dance to. Meanwhile Ibrahim values the stress on individual success that defines the milieu of Julie's father. When they fell in love, he overlooked their incompatibility on such a deep philosophical basis and Julie lacked the awareness to formulate it. The upshot of betrayal puts the confrontation between individualist and communitarian values in a framework of gender dynamics, posing a thought provoking dilemma for feminist thought. ...more Hated it.

I'm less concerned about using that word to describe Nadine Gordimer. She has the prizes and awards to suggest she is unrivalled, or, at least, her rivals are limited to those who have also won the Nobel Prize. But some of her company is less impressive than others, and I can't imagine any literary critic who suggests that some people are not missing from that exalted pantheon of writers. Anyways, word after word after word, I think I'm prepared to call Nadine Gordimer unrivalled (I'm bound to regret this in the future though). And this is a conclusion I've come to after reading a book that largely disappointed me. That felt almost cliche and simple, but never was presented as such. In <+++>The Pickup</+++> we are told the story of Julie and this odd romantic, loving relationship she develops with an illegal immigrant in South Africa who repairs her broken car. The one gets deported, and she follows him to his home country - some unnamed nowhere surrounded by deserts, Arabs, and simple traditional lives that are in a process of quiet change. It almost sounds like it could be a pitch for a Hollywood movie; something about this story is too familiar. In fact, at one point, after about 80 pages, I almost put the book down because I figured it probably was cliche. I battled through and continued my reading. I'm glad I did, but, again, this book is not spellbinding or incredible or perfect or anything that I would recommend over any of the other books I have read by Gordimer. But it is still good. And like good books, it has so much that it can teach us. The thing I love about Gordimer is that she reminds us of the things that divide us and that bring us together. No cleavage is too grand for us. But the way she talks about this isn't in the grand ways that journalists manage to - the ideas too big for their goals or their goals too big for their ideas. Rather, Gordimer catches the divide in silent monologues and hidden thoughts as her speaker/narrator moves from one man's mind to another woman's mind to another woman's to a child's to another man's and we hear the confusion and frustration that is never shared. The essential question is, \"Why can't they be more like us?\". And it is through the small things - the tiny giant things - that we discover this in Gordimer's writing. The way somebody takes up a space, shares a home, uses a bed, talks, wants to learn, imagines their future, makes promises. Its the way somebody smiles and hugs and kisses, when where how why a person permits themselves or is permitted to other to behave in a given way. Life is complicated Gordimer says, and it is always dramatic, Gordimer says, but it is the human desire to smooth over the uncertain by forging friendly, loving relationships that makes us human, Gordimer says. And this is always complicated. It is always marred by power. And that power, those relationships of one having strength over another, is in flux and it is ancient and it is written into a stone that might, just might, crumble sometimes. Gordimer is unrivalled in seeing this, and writing this, and bringing it into clarity for the reader. There are no surprises in <+++>The Pickup</+++>. That's not the point. Plot is important, but it is only a vehicle for further exploration - and so everything is foreshadowed plenty. The reader knows more than the characters, and this is why Gordimer matters. She offers the world empathy, and a vision of how humanity can relate in times of difficulty. Forgive me for taking the chance to write about Gordimer more than The Pickup. There is nothing extraordinary about this book, and it doesn't present itself as extraordinary - another trait of Gordimer's writing - but it is quite an accomplishment regardless. Read her work. Read other works before you read this one. But make time in your life for Gordimer - it is always worth the effort. ...more Second novel read by Gordimer.

On a couple of levels. First, the plot. I found Julie to be utterly insufferable. Every decision she makes is not real, it\u2019s just another way for her to do exactly what everyone else doesn\u2019t want her to do. At nearly 30, she\u2019s way too old for the teenage rebellion. She and her \"friends\" at the cafe live their entire lives trying to meet some sort of moral code that they think makes them superior to everyone else while they are completely unappreciative of what they do have. Her relationship with Abdu is just a way for her to take her rebellion to its outer limits. Abdu\u2019s family in the \"Arab village\" (more on that later) is infinitely more interesting than Julie or any of her friends. My only consolation is that Abdu also finds her insufferable from time to time. I realize this assessment is entirely personal. People with these sorts of airs and pretensions get on my last nerve. Second, the writing. Gordimer does her very best to make you need to read every passage at least twice to figure out what she is trying to say. It got to the point that I felt like I was watching a movie through a vaseline smeared screen; you have to squint to see what\u2019s going on. And then there\u2019s the matter of this \"unnamed Arab village\". The author is very determined that this \"unnamed village\" be mysterious and a stand-in for the average Arab village, but then she drops a clue that told me within 2 minutes of googling that they\u2019re in Morocco. So if you want it to be unnamed and representative, why drop that clue? I don\u2019t get it. And then there\u2019s the brief side plot of Julie\u2019s uncle being unjustly accused of sexual harassment. It had absolutely zero effect on the plot, so it felt like the author just wanted to make the point that \"Hey! Some women lie about sexual harassment!\" Every drawn out, metaphoric passage felt like the author poking me in the eye and saying \"Ha ha! I\u2019m sooooo much smarter than you.\" What could be an interesting story about the nature of immigration is buried under all this\u2026affectation. It wasn\u2019t even a good love story. So yeah. Thumbs down. One of the longest short books I\u2019ve ever read.

This means novels, in particular, have changed a good bit in their function over the centuries. Once upon a time novels confirmed the social order--think of Jane Austen. Now we have writers like Nadine Gordimer who was born into the white discomfort of black South Africa, and she manages to write plausible, discomfiting stories that make us dissatisfied, appalled, sympathetic, and even, occasionally, energetic. In the case of The Pickup Gordimer assigns herself a task that at first I found a kind of fairy tale, not every credible. Reaching beyond South Africa, she places a man from the Arab world in South Africa, has a white South African rich girl take a shine to him, and then, in the first part of the novel, traces his descent into deportation--for he has come to South Africa, as he has gone elsewhere, illegally. And the authorities have caught up to him, and this time he can\u2019t fight it, he has to leave. Okay, but it\u2019s challenging to believe in Julie\u2019s love for Abdu. She is recognizable, a young p.r. professional who hangs out in cafes. He is intentionally vague, doesn\u2019t want to be seen. What country does he come from? We\u2019re not told. Where else has he been? Not told. Is there more here than Julie\u2019s social rebellion and his fugitive\u2019s allure? The novel\u2019s first 75 pages tumble along from past tense to present tense, first person to third, and are short on quotation marks, distinguishing who\u2019s talking or thinking. Sort of thin. Where does this guy come from? Well, Julie decides she\u2019s going back there with him. What do you think of that? It\u2019s hard to know, but it happens. He\u2019s deported and she goes right along with him. My guess is that they go to Yemen. I could be wrong, and I\u2019m not sure exactly how important it is that I\u2019m right, but I find, as I read, that I like thinking, \u201cThey\u2019re in Yemen. They\u2019re in his home village outside the capital, on the fringes of the desert, in a ghastly place.\u201d Turns out his name isn\u2019t Abdu, it\u2019s Ibrahim, he has a family that has seen him deported back home before but never in the company of a white female non-Muslim. This is where the novel becomes interesting. It doesn\u2019t take a turn toward Ibrahim having been some kind of failed sleeper in an al-Qaeda cell. It focuses on him expending all of his energy trying to get a visa to some other country that might give him a chance in life. And it focuses, more importantly, on the crushing process of Julie learning how to be a woman in the cramped difficult confines of Ibrahim\u2019s family\u2019s house--and life. I find myself highly skeptical. Experiences like this really don\u2019t work very well. They turn out as Ibrahim constantly fears: she\u2019ll decide to call Daddy and get a ticket back to South Africa. But Gordimer keeps pounding at the situation into which Julie becomes more and more embedded, finding a meaning in certain relations, times of day, beliefs, methods of preparing food that she never found in the emerald belt of South African suburbs where she was raised. The territory we\u2019re in is Paul Bowles\u2019s territory, but that\u2019s just one take on it. It\u2019s also Gordimer\u2019s. She\u2019s got the right feeling for the desert, the trash, the dust, the limited options, the minor flashes of tackiness, the turbulent emotions within Ibrahim\u2019s family, and Julie\u2019s gradual realization that she has built a life for herself there. I\u2019m not going to take this description of the book to its narrative end. That would spoil it for you. I want to go back to where I started: the fiction writer today is bearing a burden that a lot of journalists, politicians, health workers, business people and scientists are bearing: how to bring the First and Third Worlds, the Christian and Islamic worlds in particular, closer together. This isn\u2019t Jane Austen, who is wonderful in her way. This is a writer of relentless intelligence and aesthetic vision.

It was so \"oppressed-looked\" I don't know about the country of his , but it showed how Arab countries control their women and it was ugly , while in fact, as an Arab girl myself, it is not how the book presented. Abdu, pardon my words , is a retard , ignorant guy. The way he treated Julie as disgusting. Do not tell me that he had his reasons , because he was nothing but a selfish and \"brat\". He thought that Julie is his \"follower\", that she would keep submissive to him ?? He is wrong , women should not be treated like that.

The Pickup sat on my bookshelf for a few months until I finally grabbed it on my way to the park one day, and from that point forward, I struggled with what was soon to become my biggest love-hate relationship with a piece of literature. I mean, I loved the plot. Loved it. Man picks up woman (or does Woman pick up Man?), and they begin a ferociously fast-paced relationship which eventually leads to a swift marriage and a reluctant deportation back to Man's native (north African? Middle Eastern?) country. The protagonist, Julie, was likable in many regards... but ultimately, I don't think I was able to overcome my frustration with her na\u00efvet\u00e9. There were times when I wanted to hold the book up to my face and scream directly into its pages: \"He doesn't love you, Julie! God, woman, can't you see that he's only using you and your race/wealth in order to immigrate to another country?\" But I refrained from such foolish behavior, because in the end, I fell in love with Julie Summers and with her independent nature. One thing that I struggled with in the beginning was the way in which Gordimer narrates her story. It was extremely difficult at times to decipher exactly which character the author had intended to be speaking, and I got the feeling that Gordimer probably secretly gets some sort of sick pleasure in having her readers glance over the same passage two or three times in order to figure out what she is saying. It was, without a doubt, one of the longest short books I've ever read. ...more Nadine Gordimer's apparently a pretty awesome lady.

Are pages and pages without dialogue the best way to express that? Oh, and there are no quotation marks Nadine Gordimer's apparently a pretty awesome lady.

Julie's friends are THE worst, always talking about affecting social change but doing absolutely nothing and merely going back to their parents' suburban, gated homes. I don't know what the answer is to the massive economic inequalities facing South Africa, and I'm certainly not advocating that they relocate to SoWeTo or something, but UGH. The worst. The guy, whose name I totally can't remember because it's been months since I decided to torture myself by attempting to slog through another few pages of this mess, fares a bit better and is pretty sympathetic, but really, this is supposed to be a love story yet things went sour quite quickly. Maybe this is normal over the course of a relationship. Maybe I'm naive. Maybe I'm projecting my romantic insecurities onto some character that vaguely resembles the worst parts of myself. Maybe I will never finish this book. Maybe I'll be okay with that. ...more A fellow book-lover at work gave me this one as a \u201cblind date with a book.\u201d I\u2019d never read any of Gordimer\u2019s work before, and I\u2019m happy for the introduction.

It\u2019s about family and belonging and outsiders and insiders and citizenship and home and culture and the many permeable boundaries that surround and separate us. It\u2019s about motivation and privilege and priorities and perspective. It\u2019s about leaving, being left, being sent away, staying, choosing your place in the world. It\u2019s about finding what you need in the unlikeliest of places. I think I might read this one again. I suspect there are layers I missed the first time around, things that will come into focus with a second reading. Highly recommended. ...more A white South African woman and an illegal immigrant from an Arab nation working as a car mechanic meet by chance one day and start a relationship.

What's obvious is that they're both using each other -- she needs him to prove to everyone that she is truly rejecting the wealthy suburban life of her parents, while he needs a connection to the middle/upper class as a way around his unwanted illegal immigrant status. This could have been a really interesting story, if it weren't for the disjointed (no complete sentences, no use of quotation marks to denote dialogue) way in which the prose is written. I kept having to re-read sentences to find out what was going on and who was supposed to have spoken, which really disrupted the narrative flow. ...more I won't get much into the story as I am racing today--after lying in my bed for the past two hours compelled to finish this great work.

The story is compelling, a young South African woman, white, falls for an impoverished illegal immigrant Abdu and we want to find out what happens to both. She keeps the pace going, hard. What is so astonishing is how Gordimer relates their inner thoughts, almost no dialogue. How she sets the story in real-world issues and in eternal (I almost said 'verities,' sorry). Deep and riveting. What is home? This is the profound question among many. I found this book in paperback at a local library sale and returned three days later to see if I could find another Gordimer story, and I did. This is what I will read next: \"A Sport of Nature.\" ...more This novel follows a cross-cultural and cross-socio-economic relationship. It is incredibly perceptive and realistic. And compelling.

Beautifully written book about a cross-cultural relationship in contemporary Africa. Human mobility is a funny thing, and the way people experience it varies so greatly...from \"expats\" to \"aliens\" to \"travelers\" and \"seekers\" and everything in between. Great and very insightful book about relationships, migration, and social class. I loved this book, especially the powerful ending. Are we attracted to difference or do we look for what we lack in a partner? This is a story about two people who meet in South Africa and fall in love, despite being of different race, nationality and immigration status, but most importantly about how our upbringing defines our ultimate priorities in life. 14 JUL 2015 - recommended by Bettie. Many thanks! One of the best endings I have ever read. Truly provocative. This was a selection of my book club and I was intrigued because the author won the Nobel Prize in Literature: in \"1991 was awarded to Nadine Gordimer \"who through her magnificent epic writing has - in the words of Alfred Nobel - been of very great benefit to humanity\".

Having said that, her book, the Pickup,\" was a different kind of read for me. I'll mention that the only copy available through the library was large print, and oddly enough, I found that the large font on rather small pages made Gordimer's unique, choppy sentence structure even more difficult to follow. Suffice it to say that due to rereading many sentences masquerading as paragraphs in a quest for subject, verb, and referents to the many pronouns, I probably read the book twice. ***Spoilers to follow*** The Pickup is rich with atmosphere, three-dimensional characters,universal plotlines in an unusual geographical setting. Julie is a nieve,upper middle-class (I think not upper class...but not completely sure) white woman/girl in post-Apartheid South Africa. in her late twenties, she is college educated and works in public relations, but she is adrift, not motivated (which I think is common among comfortable youngish people). She spends her free time in the L.A. Cafe coffee house in the bohemian neighborhood where she and her friends live. Throughout the book this group is collectively referred to as The Table. Julie has a strained relationship with her elitist father and has made The Table her surrogate Family. She meets Abdu, an attractive Black man working illegally as a car repairman. The story evolves as the two consciously and unconsciously use one another to achieve their own ends. There is tremendous irony in the story (I adore irony). Abdu likes Julie, but there is no doubt that a major part of her attraction is that her family is quite wealthy and well-connected. Abdu's fierce dream is to escape his unnamed backward third-world country and become a legitimate part of Western capitalist society. Julie's \"dream\" seems to be to have someone to support, to be aligned with, and she has chosen Abdu. Neither loves one another, but they are drifting in the NOW. This comes to a screeching halt when Abdu is reported as an illegal and is forced to go back to his despised home country, in spite of all the efforts that Julie and some of her friends make. Abdu is disappointed that Julie isn't willing to ask her father to help him, but Julie is adamant and does get some help from her surrogate father, her Uncle. Things continue to spin out of control for Abdu as Julie purchases two tickets to his country. He seems unwilling to cut off their relationship, even though it hasn't been as helpful as he had hoped, and he insists that they marry as it would be impossible for him to take her back with him as anything other than his wife. ***Spoiler Alert*** Thus begins the ironic journey of Ibrahim (Abdu's real name) and Julie. For instead of hating the nameless country, its poor hygiene, corrupt politics, and mud huts, Julie falls in love with it...falls in love with Ibrahim's family and with the simple life contained there. and the family falls in love with Julie. Ibrahim never waivers in his commitment to his Western dream, but it becomes increasingly difficult for him to maintain his resolve without hurting the people that he loves...especially his mother and also his uncle. Julie was intended to be Ibrahim's ship to a better life, but instead, she turns into a boat anchor, with the potential to tether him forever to the place he has grown to hate so very much. Ironically, what Ibrahim despises, Julie romanticises and adores. Their values are completely opposite...which does not bode well for a marriage. Throughout the story Julie has been a quiet comfort to Ibrahim as he doggedly pursues a visa to a western country--ANY western country--while she just as quietly develops a dream of her own. This is made clear when the coveted visa finally arrives...helped in great part by the efforts of Julie's mother and stepfather in California (without Julie's permission). Ibrahim is ecstatic. His plans were finally coming together. Julie would go to California and stay with her mother for awhile, which could be useful, developing contacts there. Ibrahim would go to Detroit on his own and live the bare, scraping life of an immigrant once more, until he could accumulate enough money, get a foothold... And then the mouse roared. Julie refused to go..not just to California, but to go anywhere. She decided to stay with his family. She was happy. she wanted to have a child, to teach English, to be content. For her it was enough, more than enough. For Ibrahim it was death to his materialistic dream: he was obsessed with everything that the First World had to offer. He would prove that he was good enough, that he was worthy, that he was equal. And to top it off, he had allowed himself to fall in love with Julie! His frustration and testosterone were palpable. In the end, Ibrahim leaves alone and the relatives are told the story that Julie would follow in a couple of weeks...once Ibrahim has a place arranged and so forth. But certainly the mother and Julie know that this is not the case. They become co-conspirators to entice Ibrahim back to the homeland. Perhaps just as enticing are the open questions remaining at the end of the book: Is Julie pregnant? I thought she very well may be as it was pretty clear that her birth control pill supply had to be gone for some time. if she WAS pregnant, then what? Would Ibrahim return because of the child? If Julie isn't pregnant, what then? What might happen to Ibrahim? His chances of making a success appear slim, and yet he is incredibly determined, bright, and calculating. He might find another \"Julie\" who is more practically helpful to his cause. Would he risk his family's, i.e., his mother's, disapproval, since Julie is now a loved member of the family? He is muslim so perhaps he can say \"I divorce you\" three time and cut Julie lose. What would happen then? Would Ibrahim's family stand by her anyway? So if Ibrahim does make his way in the US, what then? My book club member, Kris, wisely observed that the first person he would want to bring to the US would be his mother. He loves and respects her and would want to give her a chance at success, too. I think that if the mother went to Detroit then Julie would, too...maybe. But in the end, I was left with the sense that there wouldn't be much happiness for Ibrahim. Without bad intentions, Julie undermined his efforts and rather than becoming his ship, she sank it. Julie had from the start been completely maleable, adaptable, so Ibrahim had assumed that she would continue to follow his lead. So focused on his own goals that he stopped paying attention to Julie's. Yet no matter what happens--or doesn't happen--I don't think he would ever be content to live peacefully in Africa the way Julie could. Fate has cast Ibrahim a mean blow: he has drunk the Western koolaid and he is addicted. He will always be looking to \"score.\" ...more<---C>Nadine Gordimer</---C>", "Title": "The Pickup"},
