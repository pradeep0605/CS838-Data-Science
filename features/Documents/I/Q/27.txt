Is there no end to their tall blond pretty perfection and their warm fuzzy wraparound social democracy? But now, one grungy vampire tale <+++>Let the Right One In</+++> let\u2019s me know in no uncertain terms that Swedes suffer too. Behind the perky teeth and healthy children and universal dentistry and free housing for all and trams and no nuclear waste and Mamma Mia there\u2019s urban decay,<---M> neglected glue-sniffing kids</---M>, violence, drunkenness, wasted lives and compellingly unpleasant vampires. This is chicken soup for my soul, with swedes! And not only that, but as many persons have pointed out, this is a kind of anti-Twilight, given that the only sexually attractive vampire around is a 200 year old 12 year old girl and the only attracting going on is with an adult paedophile and a miserable lonely 12 year old boy. So stick that up your sacro-iliac, Bella and Edward! I fart in your general direction! This book gets major points for being so accurate about childhood terrors of the non-imaginary kind (bullying). In fact it's really about childhood neglect and the vampire stuff can be read as an extended poetic symbol. But the vampire stuff is also gory and it rocks , so you can have your sensitive cake and you can greedily gobble it up it too. Anyway, altogether, a maxillo-facial gothtastic read - 3.5 stars. ***** Update : the film rocks too. It pulls a few punches and cuts out a major zombie theme but otherwise a does a great job. Rent it! Up-update - I was referring here to the movie <+++>Let the Right One In</+++> by Thomas Alfredson, made in Sweden in 2009 and not the Hollywood remake by Matt Reeves just released, which I haven't seen. Upupupupdate : I saw the American remake and that's great too - I wouldn't lie to you, I was very surprised. So - rent that one too! Upupupupupupdate : they're still at it!

The working class Swedish suburb where the story takes place feels dingy, depressing and rundown. The people moving through the narrative are sad, detached and very weird (mostly) and the atmosphere is a kind of artsy fogginess that makes everything seem dreamlike and slightly\u2026well\u2026. off . All of which adds up to a big, fat, musty pants load of CREEPY . \u00a0 Of course, it\u2019s horror, and Swedish horror at that, so creepy means its doing something right. Beyond the high creepy quotient, this story is hard to pin down. While the main character is a vampire, this is not really a vampire story. It's more a violent, existential character study\u00a0about \u201coutcasts\u201d living on the fringe of society. It just so happens that one of these outcasts is a gothy, child vampire of dubious age and sexuality who moves into this economically depressed neighborhood and befriends an adolescent boy named Oskar.\u00a0Here\u2019s Eli from the movie (which I have not yet seen): good casting because that\u2019s a pretty close approximation of how I visualized her Eli. The aforementioned Oskar, our main character, is a 12 year old whose life is a bit of a mess. He's sad, lonely and incontinent and splits his time between being mercilessly bullied by his schoolmates and indulging in a rich, twisted fantasy world where he murders his tormentors in sick, disgusting ways. Here\u2019s a shot of Oskar \u201cat play\u201d Oskar\u2019s dad is an alcoholic who lives in the country and his mother, who is mentioned often but rarely heard from in the book seems both over-protective and incredibly neglectful. His life is bordering on tragic. However, as far from normal as Oskar and Eil may seem, the \"I'm So VERY Odd\" Award goes to Eli\u2019s \u201cRenfield-like\u201d man-servant, Hakan. Hakan\u2019s job, which he does out of *shudder* love for Eli, is to secure the vampire\u2019s nourishment. In his spare time, Hakan is a sick, unhinged, pedophile (now you understand the shudder) who is constantly struggling with his predelictions and the awful things he has to do to keep Eli alive. Again... *shudder* Trust me, by the end of the story, Hakan dumps a whole truckload of creepy all over the story. Oh and no spoilers but just remember...ACID....wow!!! I struggled with the rating for this book because I don't want to mislead by having my rating indicate that I thought this was\u00a0\u201cmiddle of road good.\u201d Parts of it are much better than that...but parts are also worse. The book is a tad schizophrenic. There are some amazing 5 star aspects and some unappealing 1 and 2 star components, all of which coagulate into an overall rating of \u201cI liked it\u201d but didn't love it. On the positive side, the prose is excellent and the characters of Eli, Hakan and Oskar are very interesting. In addition, Eli is an original and superbly realistic vampire that I thought was just a wonderful take on the mythos. Had the story dealt more with those three components and with the unique form of vampirism that the novel postulates, I would have been far more happy with the book. Unfortunately (and here we get to the bad), the story gets seriously bogged down with a handful of other characters in the town whose stories were just not compelling to me. I kept losing focus on the story whenever the narrative slipped to one of these ancillaries and it really degraded my enjoyment of the story. Also, the dreariness of the whole story did begin to weigh on me. It just got a bit too much. I thought the end was well done and kept pace with the level of realism that the author was going for with the story. Overall, I just found the \"non central\" aspects of the story a little too dull to keep my attention. That and the \"life sucks\" tone that never lets up kept my overall level of appreciation a bit muted. Still, good writing and a very original, character driven vampire tale. A strong 3.0 to 3.5 stars. \u00a0Recommended. ...more After watching the Swedish movie this book is based on, I thought it was an intensely creepy film and promptly got the book to check out the full story.

Set in the early \u201880s, it features a 12 year old boy named Oskar whose alcoholic father and overprotective mother are divorced. Oskar is an outcast and is badly bullied by other kids in his class, and he\u2019s developing a pretty good case of homicidal rage because of it. In fact, he\u2019s well on his way to becoming the kind of guy who dances around his basement while screaming at his latest victim to put the lotion on it\u2019s skin or else it gets the hose again. Before Oskar completely turns into Buffalo Bill, he meets Eli, a deadly vampire who appears to be a 12 year old girl. Oskar and Eli strike up an unlikely friendship that\u2019s almost a pre-adolescent romance, but things are going off the rails around them. Eli\u2019s version of Renfield is a creepy pedophile who is jealous of their relationship and can\u2019t be counted on to keep Eli supplied with fresh blood. When Eli\u2019s need for food makes her sloppy, the results are victims and traces that threaten to reveal her. Juvenile delinquents, Swedish alcoholics, a strict cop, a jar of acid and a herd of cats all collide in a variety of terrible ways. This is a gloriously gruesome and disturbing horror novel that would probably cause Stephanie Meyer to have a stroke if she ever even dared to hold a copy of it in her hackish little hands. Like the best horror novels, the gore and monsters aren\u2019t the scary parts, it\u2019s the way that the \u2019normal\u2019 people treat each other that will really haunt you. ...more Imagine for a moment that you were at an event, like the 1995 Rugby World cup where South Africa both hosted and won.

Imagine being there in the heat of that moment - the cheer and ebulation. That light, almost unreal sense that the world has faded away and there is only that moment. Nothing else is important and you want to quietly capture the complete bliss you are experiencing and put it in a bottle somewhere. Hopefully at some future date you can take it out and rekindle those emotions and bask in that one, perfect moment again. Then imagine that you are standing outside of a train station. A train has just crashed in front of you. Pleople are screaming, and the stench of smoking meat is tickling your nose as your eyes sting and water. There's that same feeling. That feeling of, \"Is this really happening?\" Light. Dizzy. Disbelief. Overwhelming to the point of nausea. You can't forget that moment. It will haunt you. Every time you catch a wiff of smoke those memories will come flooding back, whether you want them to or not. Same feelings, at their most basic level, but entirely different in their mode. In the first situation you jump and holler. You'll hug those around you, even if you don't know them, and celebrate together. Knitted into temporary friendship because you're experiencing the same, awesome event. For weeks later you'll tell anybody who listens that you were there. You'll tell them about how incredible it was and try to impart on them some semblance of what you felt. Cut back to the second scenario where you'll stand quietly in solidarity with those around you. Once again, knitted together. Brothers and sisters formed from tragedy. You may hold each other and gather around silently. When other people ask you about it, you'll get that look in your eyes that tells them you've seen things . You're just as altered as the first scene, but where there was ebulation then, there is horror now. This is what happens when I read certain books. Books like Stolen fit in the first category. They touch me and move me, so I run around telling everyone that I read it. It was amazing. Share in this experience with me. I want to help you feel what I felt. Then there are books like this. Now I quietly tell you that I read it. That it touched me. Changed me. I look you in the eye and I don't want to elaborate. I quitely turn away and think a little bit more on what I've seen and read, and how it made me feel. And maybe if you've read a book like this too, you might be able to understand why there's really nothing more for me to say. ...more As seen on The Readventurer I can't even find the words to describe how much I LOVED this novel.

But once you understand the pace and get used to foreign names, the story consumes you. I will not relay the plot here, if you want to know what exactly the book is about, there are many reviews here that describe the story well. What I am going to say is that this is simply the best vampire novel I've ever read. Yes, I am putting it higher even than legendary Bram Stoker's \"Dracula.\" This story is so much more complex and interesting in a way that not only does it show vampires from the point of view of their victims, but it also shows the world through the eyes of the vampires. We find out how very often innocent people become those feared monsters, we go through the transformation with them, we feel their guilt and shame, we learn about their relationships with their \"Guardians\" (who sometimes are worse monsters than vampires themselves). But this book is not only about vampires, it explores the world of adolescent boys (the world I know nothing about). Surprisingly, I found out how important presence of a father in a boy's life. Without the guidance a love of a father, boys are lost to violence and abuse. With all the horridness described in this book, it is strangely full of love and tenderness, understanding and forgiveness. I highly recommend this book. You simply will not be able to walk away untouched by it. ...more Dear Stephenie, This is how you write a \"vampire\" book. Sincerely, The World Terrifying, engrossing and a book that encompasses many different topics. Not just a story about vampires; this book takes on such issues as bullying, revenge, pedophilia, prostitution, drug use, alcoholism and the sheer desperation of loneliness. Beautifully written and terribly disturbing. This book sets the bar for the genre. Loved it. Scary as hell and so violent. Think i shat myself along with Tommy in that basement. The first and probs only vampire book I will ever read. Loved it. And loved both films. I finished reading \u201cLet the right one in\u201d last night and immediately started reading a book about some nice people having a nice Catholic life in a nice part of Northern Ireland with a nice summer house and a nice family. It was all very nice. (for those of you who are wondering the nice book is The Heather Blazing by Colm Toibin - it\u2019s on the 1001 books list.) I\u2019ve had this nice book on my shelf for about three years and never bothered to read it till now. So, why now? I can only conclude that s I finished reading \u201cLet the right one in\u201d last night and immediately started reading a book about some nice people having a nice Catholic life in a nice part of Northern Ireland with a nice summer house and a nice family. It was all very nice. (for those of you who are wondering the nice book is The Heather Blazing by Colm Toibin - it\u2019s on the 1001 books list.) I\u2019ve had this nice book on my shelf for about three years and never bothered to read it till now. So, why now? I can only conclude that some inner part of me was secretly yearning for the application of a healing literary salve, to be applied against all the abrasions caused by reading Let the right one in. Plus if anything is sure fire protection against vampires then it has got to be Catholicism, right? \u201cLet the right one in\u201d is not a summer read. It is not light hearted or joyous or merry. There is no feel good. There is feel bad or feel dead. And then there is the undead feeling you. You will soon realise which is worse. The two principal characters, Eli and Oskar, are tweenagers (ok one wears a tweenage meat suit but has racked up enough birthdays to ensure a candle covered cake which would look more like a towering inferno), so by all rights this should be YA? YA -no way! Because vampirism generally takes a back seat to predatory adults, the torments of bullying, drug abuse, alcoholism, unemployment and clinical depression. So this is Trainspotting with Vampires? No, because Trainspotting was funny and this is most decidedly not. Oskar and Eli form the unlikely friendship generated by their outcast status, where their fringe existence will cancel out all the other issues such as eternal life and a murderous blood-lust, which might otherwise act as a barrier. With Eli\u2019s arrival in the community, Oskar\u2019s life and self confidence is much improved. His chances of survival against his bullies actually increases. Sadly the same cannot be said for the rest of walking blood banks and a spate of vicious bungled attacks sends shock waves through the unsuspecting community. On a side note, as alcoholism is the principal diversion within the town, it is frankly a wonder that Eli does not spend most of the book recovering from a monster hangover. All jokes aside, this book is dark and a bit grubby. It would smell of mould and damp cloth and empty buildings. It probably tastes like rust and decay. It is rotten, but in a good way. Even in the blackest moments, towards the end where violence is heaped on tragedy and tragedy is heaped upon everyone, there is a tiny pin prick of light, and it comes from Oskar because he has developed resilience and you know he might just survive after all. \u201cLet the right one in\u201d is a book to be read with a lit fire, a blanket and the curtains drawn against cold starry nights and the things that stand outside the window in the dark. The things you cannot see because in your brightly illuminated living room, you see only your own reflection on the inside of the glass. So don\u2019t forget to draw those curtains and only let the right ones in. ...more Wow!!!!! One of my all time faves, hands down.... Best writing and characterization I've read in a long time!

I am in awe of Lindqvist's ability to write, it is impossible for me to enjoy a book without great writing and the translation was so spot on it did not read like one at all. Sweden, a place I've never been, became real to me without having to put much of my imagination to work. The streets, stores, housing, woods--everything was laid out so well, as if I was there. And the characters, there were so many of them that I thought I'd be unable to remember them all. Yet, not only could I remember them, they each became very human through his excellent writing. At first I couldn't understand how all these storylines mattered but they came together perfectly, and I was able to follow everything as if I was right alongside each of them, and because they were so real to me it became hard to dislike many of them (except a few-one in particular!) despite all of their flaws. (If you are not a very empathetic person, I can see standing back and judging almost everyone in this book as a bad person--the alcoholics, the jobless, the terribly lost and lonely people, etc. To me that didn't happen one bit...except for the bullies....and the other ONE (view spoiler) [it involves pedophilia (hide spoiler) ] , because they are human...made so by the amazing writing....it did make me sad for them, but in no way did I find them deserving of my judgement, instead I was hoping strongly for their survival and much better days ahead.) This was a complex story made simple to read through Lindqvist's superior ability. This is exactly what a vampire book should be.....but it's also so much more. The story of Eli and Oskar of course took center stage, but the stories of everyone else in the book drew me in as well, especially Oskars mother, and Tommy and his mother. Lacke and Virginia.... The narration throughout the entire book was extremely realistic as well, not once did it feel strained; the conversations were so perfectly written, the way people actually speak; and I could always feel how the characters were feeling. I have found that very rare in books...Lindqvist possesses a magic that is released when you read his words. There were gross, stomach curdling parts...no one has made me that disgusted by some of the acts committed in years. (This is a book for true horror lovers only!) But, there was also tenderness, a caring for others, and a desire in the reader to see Eli stay \"alive\"----no matter what had to be done, because we've learned Eli's sad past :( It is very very late---and I promised to reward myself by watching the Swedish movie version as soon as I was finished, so I will have to return and make a better review....at this moment I don't want the story to end---and I know when the movie is over I'm going to feel lost without Eli and Oskar....I want a sequel (and a long one)!!! How do you move on to another book after this? Okay...I've watched both versions of the movie (so glad i waited until after the book!) The American one...Sucks. The Swedish one is great--on it's own I would have loved it!....But, like all movies based on books--even excellent ones like this--it leaves far too much out. Make sure to watch the right movie--AFTER reading the book! ... by the way...I'm still grieving my loss of Oskar and Eli... Finally--the title is from a Morrisey song--as well as a quote at the beginning of this book...love that! It seems he's a huge fan...not only in this book. I hope to find more excellent books by this author, now....and hoping he's working on a big, fat sequel; the smallish sequel in the book Let the Old Dreams Die leaves plenty (tons) of room for onel! ...more The character writing is phenomenal.

That said, John Ajvide Lindqvist's Let the Right One In (translated and distributed in the U.S. as Let Me In ) unsettled me in multiple ways. I actually started reading it in 2012, then again in 2013, before finally making it through its house of horrors. And I'm sure glad that I did. The title is a play on the Morrissey tune \"Let the Right One Slip In\" If I listed the things that scared me most, vampires running around looking for blood wouldn't rate in my top 10. They wouldn't rate in my top 50. That said, John Ajvide Lindqvist's Let the Right One In (translated and distributed in the U.S. as Let Me In ) unsettled me in multiple ways. I actually started reading it in 2012, then again in 2013, before finally making it through its house of horrors. And I'm sure glad that I did. The title is a play on the Morrissey tune \"Let the Right One Slip In\", but the story takes place in the winter of 1981 in a suburb outside Stockholm, Sweden called Blackeberg. Let that slip in for a moment. Lindqvist does a marvelous job setting the table in a neighborhood with no past, no future, where even the angles of the apartment buildings seem a little strange somehow. Oskar is a 12-year-old latchkey kid, raised by a single mother, with no siblings, no friends. He's tormented so relentlessly at school that he has trouble controlling his bladder. He shoplifts, and fills his head with morbid thoughts of taking revenge against his tormentors. While my school experience was nowhere near as hopeless, I related to Oskar's plight much more than I wanted to. In the dead of night, Oskar receives new neighbors, including a young girl about his own age who gives the name Eli. Meeting in the courtyard playground after dark, Eli talks like an adult, smells like an old bandage, seems impervious to the cold and solves a Rubik's Cube without effort. In no time, a teenager is found murdered in the forest, drained of blood, and Blackeberg's nightmare begins. Rather than crank out another tired tale of vampires, Lindqvist's narrative is about how we alienate each other and keep even loved ones at arm's length. Much more than the Swedish or U.S. film versions, the novel expands its scope to characters who were mere extras in the movies, or not included at all. Lindqvist has an ability to invest us in even minor characters introduced very quickly, for example, a bachelor driving home from a blind date that's gone very well for him, until he encounters something on a bridge. This is hardcore horror fiction. There were moments where I thought, \"That's as fucked up a thing as any human could experience\" only to have something even more dreadful happen next. Pedophilia, skin burns, razorblades, drowning, mean cats and being locked in a dark room freak me out and Lindqvist works them all into the story to maximum effect. There are horrors as potent as anything in Thomas Harris' Red Dragon or The Silence of the Lambs . Reviewers have cited a somewhat inconsistent and clunky English translation as posing pacing problems, but I was so absorbed in the characters -- particularly Eli, who would tear all of Stephenie Meyer's vampires limb from limb as a mercy killing -- that I barely noticed. My complaint was the last scene, which feels anti-climactic and poses more questions of logic than it answers. Lindqvist's footing doesn't seem as strong in his final paragraphs, but the rest of the novel is so emotionally visceral that five stars was never a question. ...more For some reason, I thought this was a YA tale.

There are thousands of ratings and reviews on this book, plus there's a movie, so what more can I contribute to this conversation? Not that much! I enjoyed the main characters, I enjoyed how the issues dealt with herein-bullying, alcoholism, pedophilia were introduced and discussed, and I definitely enjoyed the ending! There were a few weird side plots going on and it never became clear to me how they connected with the main one, but I ended up enjoying those too. I would like to say that the narrator, Steven Pacey, was freaking AWESOME. He was immediately added to my favorite narrators list. Overall, this book was fun, (it was definitely not YA and it dealt with the vampire issue, (and other issues), in a realistic and interesting way. Recommended for fans of vampire fiction! ...more \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b8\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf, \u03c3' \u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af\u03b3\u03c9: \u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf

I've read tons of vampire fiction and find this to be a truly refreshing take on the genre. In terms of the characters, I thought both Oskar and Eli were very compelling and flawed in ways that made them seem real. The secondary characters were also interesting and really added depth to the plot. (P.S. I could have done without the Hakan zombie subplot most of all, but understood why it was an element.) If you read horror to escape, this might not be the book for you. Some of the more disturbing facets of everyday life intrude upon the story (pedophilia, alcoholism, unemployment, bullying) and dominate it. Any one of those things could fill thousands of volumes on its own, so you can imagine what it means to have them all as components of one story. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this book.

Our fish died, giving my young, beautiful, precocious, cherished and oh-so vulnerable daughter her first glimpse at Death . It was my first real parenting rite of passage, and I failed abysmally. Me: croaking something about the Circle of Life as I stood in my pajamas holding the previously very alive Fuzzy Fish, his kaleidoscope colors already blanching into the generic paper towel with which he had been hastily gathered; she: heaving, sobbing, inconsolable, uncomprehending, a little less innocent and a little more inured. We solemnly buried him in the backyard and I have since done my best to fix things by buying her a new fish, some new toys, taking her out for ice cream and making more time to play with her. Hollow restitution, the true Circle of Life. In an effort to scrub the memory of the incident from my consciousness, I've been watching more television and have rediscovered Nigella Lawson. The quintessence of softcore cable sensuality, Nigella has commingled my parental failings with the connubial. I like to imagine myself stalking her around her kitchen, the two of us drunk on apple martinis poured from a pitcher and slathered in chocolate syrup as we tease out the culinary anagrams buried deep within the Kama Sutra. Apparently the floundering-white-male-thirty-something-whose-libido, central-to-his-sense-of-self, needs-a-shot-in-the-arm, especially-because-he-sucks-so-bad-as-a-dad demographic is of one mind, because I have noticed the odd automobile advertisement interspersed throughout the show. One such commercial, from Jeep, overlays vignettes of rugged off-roading with the narration: \"The things that make us Americans are the things we make. This has always been a nation of builders. Of craftsman. Men and women for whom straight stitches and clean welds were matters of personal pride. They made the skyscrapers and the cotton gins. The colt revolvers and the Jeep 4X4\u2032s. These things make us who we are.\" Distillation: the things we make end up making us. In a word, holism. I hate marketers because they're hacks that peddle in half-truths. The things we make DO end up making us, I just don\u2019t think a Wrangler is the way to self-actualization. We are in constant interplay with our environment because we ARE the environment. The planet and, necessarily, its derivatives are balanced ecosystems. When things get unbalanced, well, Nature or Fate or Whatever is going to step in and redress the imbalance. Call me an optimist, but I maintain that my daughter will survive the death of her fish despite me. I just hope that my shortcomings don't send her into the arms of some delinquent. Turns out that by just being present and sober, John Ajvide Lindqvist thinks I'm already halfway there. All the adults in his novel are abject failures, particularly the men. Absent, drunk, sentimental and wholly useless, they leave boys to raise themselves, to construct chimerical identities out of drugs and violence against the ambient fatigue of the Cold War. Adolescent boys confront zombies they mistake for their fathers, smashing them into oblivion with weighted trophies stolen from imposed father figures. Prepubescent boys run off to live with asexual vampires that kill other boys, themselves just as screwed up and as bereft of any context. Yup, the things we make end up making us, and we've inherited a world that has a lot of blood suckers in it.

And vampire romance? Fuck, don\u2019t get me started\u2026hate it! But you know what? This little tome kind of made me a believer. I guess there really are new and interesting ways to play with tired old ideas to make them viable again. _Let the Right One In_ centers on Oskar, a young boy who is an outsider in the dismal suburb of Sweden in which he lives (seriously, this book killed any desire I may have ever had to visit Sweden). Ridiculed and violently bullied by his classmates, overly coddled by his single mother, all but ignored by his absent father it\u2019s not altogether surprising that his fear and frustration has ended up venting itself in a fascination with murder and macabre day-dreams of violence and killing. By day Oskar is nothing more than a punching bag for his life, subject to all the forms of degradation that only schoolchildren can dish out\u2026and endure; but in his dreams he is a remorseless killer wreaking vengeance on a world whose only interest seems to lie in either humiliating or ignoring him. One night he meets another outsider, Eli, a young girl who has mysteriously started appearing at nighttime in the playground of his apartment complex, and the two make a connection that deepens until it almost seems that neither life nor death can break it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m committing a serious act of spoiler by noting that Eli is one of the undead and that even beyond this in her case appearances can be deceiving. Despite how that pr\u00e9cis may sound, there\u2019s nothing schmaltzy or high-strung about the relationship that develops between Oskar and Eli. They are both individuals who are isolated from the wider world around them but who are both desperately searching for someone who can appreciate what they feel. They are both tentative, each unwilling to place trust where before was only betrayal, but slowly they come to rely on each other for a sense of companionship that neither of them thought they could experience. Of course the old adage is proved correct: the course of true love never did run smooth. Eli is \u2018protected\u2019 by Hakan, a Renfield-like acolyte: a man willing to both pose as her father and procure for Eli the \u2018live\u2019 blood she needs in exchange for the chance to satisfy his pedophilic desires even if only obliquely. He is a man not likely to willingly stand aside as Eli forms a more lasting bond with someone else. Lindqvist does a good job of populating his story with a wide cast of characters whose lives seem very real, if rather bleak, and all of their stories intertwine and coincide with the central tale of Oskar and Eli as they struggle to maintain the tentative relationship they have formed. I will admit that occasionally I felt that the \u2018side-stories\u2019 seemed more like a distraction than an aid to the main narrative, but ultimately they all ended up culminating in a satisfying read. As noted above the book paints a very bleak picture of life in 1980\u2019s Sweden and it\u2019s kind of surprising that any of these characters refrained from slitting their own wrists, let alone Oskar the put-upon target of harsh brutality and endless mocking by his peers. Despite this bleakness, however, there is a definite ray of light, ironically enough in the relationship between an outcast loser and a member of the undead. It\u2019s a violent, blood-drenched, gore-covered ray of light to be sure, but hey when life gives you lemons make some delicious red-tinted lemonade, right? And yeah, just like many people who have already written reviews about this book I gotta say: Stephanie Meyer? This is an example of a *good* vampire romance\u2026with no sparkle!

Gore so prolonged that I would miss key plot points because I was reading the way I \"watch\" gory scenes in movies \u2013 by kind of squinting through my fingers until it's safe to look. What made it harder to bear was that my tender sensibilities were under constant assault even during plenty of non-horror scenes. Let me preface this by saying that I\u2019m one of those people who's constantly averting her eyes from the repulsive details of basic existence. I know they\u2019re out there. I deal with them when I have to, and I don\u2019t flinch. I led a homeschooling science class in dissecting animal hearts, kidneys, and even eyeballs. Not only have I raised a child and therefore done my share of diaper-changing; I used to have a job where I had to feed small children via stomach tubes. I know how disgusting life can be. But I don\u2019t want to hear about, or look at, certain details. Simple as that. I\u2019m that annoying person who says she\u2019s going to go powder her nose when she has to, you know, make a trip down the hall. I use the f-word like a comma, but I say \u201cish\u201d rather than the s-word because the s-word is gross . So\u2019s the word \u201cgross.\u201d (True story: we have a rule in my house that no one\u2019s allowed to use the word \u201cgross\u201d unless you\u2019re jokingly referring to something that is only disgusting on a non-physical level. The lizard relieving herself is \u201crepulsive.\u201d Mommy having to make a business phone call is \u201cgross.\u201d Isn\u2019t that hilarious? Just say yes.) Let Me In relentlessly walloped my ideals of tasteful reticence. The first chapter shows a boy in a school restroom dealing with incontinence and something he rigged up out of a piece of mattress foam. He calls it his \u201cpissball.\u201d Later that same chapter and in that same restroom, he is bullied until the bullies are repulsed away by a nosebleed. I could handle that. What overwhelmed me after a while was a sort of constant, casual repulsiveness. Ordinary life in this book seems to be nothing but a series of excretions. And there isn\u2019t much ordinary here. There\u2019s a lot of violence. None of it is neat, needless to say. Again, I\u2019m not a horror virgin. I cut my teeth on \u2019Salem\u2019s Lot and Night Shift . I just reread, and adored, The Shining . These are not tidy, decorous books. But they\u2019re A Little Princess compared to Let Me In . So: now you know. You\u2019ve been warned. I wish I had. I\u2019m still glad I read this book, and I\u2019m grabbing the sequel, Let The Old Dreams Die , at the library tomorrow. Okay, it\u2019s not exactly the sequel. It\u2019s a short-story collection by the same author. But one of the stories is a sequel to Let Me In , and I can\u2019t wait to read it. I want to know what happens next. I also kind of want to know what happens first . I admired and enjoyed the plot of this book, but I felt that there were some holes in the origin story of the supernatural main character. And since the book acts as if the whole point of reading it is to find out just who and what this supernatural character is , I felt a bit cheated when I didn\u2019t get a complete answer to the questions I had. I don\u2019t want to get into spoilers, but if you\u2019ve read it: where the heck was all the money coming from? And why did the man in the wig infect who he infected, when the whole point of the ceremony in question seemed to be avoiding the kind of contact that could spread that kind of infection? Anyway. If you like your horror messy, grab this book. There\u2019s a compelling story and a certain eerie beauty to be had as well. It\u2019s just hidden behind a lot of gross ish.

En general, todos los personajes tienen al menos una de estas caracter\u00edsticas y, por uno lado hace m\u00e1s interesante la historia pero por el otro...hab\u00eda algunas escenas dificiles de leer. Oskar es un ni\u00f1o perturbado que desde el primer momento te encari\u00f1a y eso se debe en gran parte a que su vida es simplemente mala...su padre es alcoh\u00f3lico, sufre terribles abusos en la escuela, NO TIENE AMIGOS, es inseguro...pero al mismo tiempo esta fascinado con los asesinatos y fantasea con cometer uno. Alrededor de \u00e9l se desarrolla la historia principal que es la de Eli. \"Estoy sola. M\u00e1s sola de lo que tu puedes pensar\" Eli...es el ejemplo de como tener una criatura m\u00edtica, respetar su esencia y poder poner algo de tu propio ingenio sin arruinar el mito (view spoiler) [el hecho de que cuando se besaran Eli pudiera transmitir sus recuerdos, que tuviera periodos de hibernaci\u00f3n, que el vampirismo fuera una enfermedad y que cuando descansar\u00e1 lo hiciera en un charco de sangre son peque\u00f1as variaciones que funcionan (hide spoiler) ] . Ella representa al vampiro inicial (no sensual, no sexual, que no desea un matrimonio) que s\u00f3lo busca sobrevivir, asesina cuando lo requiere y utiliza sus ventajas para combatir sus desventajas. La amistad entre estos dos personajes se me hiz\u00f3 fascinante, todas las revelaciones y el apoyo entre ambos fue refrescante de leer pero nunca se quita de la ecuaci\u00f3n el hecho de que Eli es peligrosa y que necesita comer y, muchas veces, que la ayuden. Por esta misma causa es que durante la historia tenemos una gran cantidad de eventos muy intensos que llevan a un climax...que sent\u00ed que se quedo corto, fue como que era una monta\u00f1a rusa que subia y sub\u00eda y al momento en que deb\u00eda dar lo mejor de si se sinti\u00f3 como un bache...pero las \u00faltimas como 4 p\u00e1ginas a mi manera de ver lo compensaron.

Lindqvist adds violent police, down and out drunks, and Eli\u2019s terrifying assistant to an interlocking mix of characters careening toward climax. Lindqvist does a stellar job of addressing the vampire myths while developing his own unique storyline. This book is as much about trust and loyalty as creating the horror mood (I should add a couple scenes scared the shit out of me); the title refers to both the vampiric inability to enter one\u2019s home without an invitation and the idea that each of us chooses who we invite into our lives and who we close out. Dead-end losers do their best to rise up through difficult circumstances while others (including the undead) struggle to reconcile their needs within both everyday relationships and larger societal expectations. I\u2019m not a huge horror novel fan, but damn, this book works well. I can see why Let The Right One In seems to be gathering a sort of cult following. This weekend I\u2019m watching the film. I\u2019m glad I read the book first. Highly recommended. ...more \"There was something in her, something that was... Pure Horror. Everything you were supposed to watch out for.

It snuck up on me so slowly - crawled, actually - that by the time I realized it was messing with my mind, I was in too deep to retract. Let the Right One In also has the honor of being one of those rare horror novels that caused me to contend with nightmares. This could, of course, be partly blamed on the fact that I chose to read this while in bed with a fever, so my mind was half-delirious anyway. It was still unsettling; that dream where I was trapped inside a dark room nervously staring at the window waiting for something (or someone) to barge in. Right from the first page, Lindqvist sets a bleak, dark tone that he relentlessly maintains, if not reinforces, page after page. Winter. Snow. Darkness. Blood. Bullying. Loneliness. Neglect. More blood. Social Outcasts. Psychopaths. Vampires. And more blood. Is the book too violent? Probably. But it's not so much the violence that's distressing as the psyche of the characters involved in the violence. Every character is shunned in some way by society, lurking on the fringes of social acceptance. So they are all, in the figurative sense, vampires, living out their lives in dark corners while dreading the new day that morning would bring. Consequently, Eli is not the creepiest aspect of this story, despite being an ancient vampire-child who feeds on humans. She is more like the trigger that sets forth an unfathomable chain of events, causing the paths of all these troubled souls to converge and build into a single terrifying crescendo. Oskar and Eli's bond is the only spark of light to be found in the story. I won't call it heartening exactly since it has its share of unnerving moments, but it's a kind of solitude that two fundamentally different but equally lonely souls share together. \"For a few seconds Oskar saw through Eli's eyes. And what he saw was himself. Only much better, more handsome, stronger than what he thought of himself. Seen with love.\" Horror is a genre I greatly enjoy so I couldn't be happier that I kicked off my 2016 Reading challenge with this gem. Though dull at the beginning, the story steadily picked up pace - now creepy, now alarming, now frantic - so much so that I blew through the last one-third in less than half the time it took me to read the first two parts combined.

It's a real testament to the author's skill that he can create a cast of characters who are at once almost wholly irredeemable and still, somehow, sympathetic. It's a world where all are monsters, to some degree, but have been shaped that way through circumstances beyond their control. ***SPOILER ALERT*** As far as the vampire angle goes, there are far more questions than answers, and no background mythology to speak of. Something that really bothered me was the lack of backstory for Eli. I understood and appreciated the slow feed of mysterious elements from Eli's history as a suspense-building tool (goodness knows this story needed SOMETHING to create suspense, and it relied on the characters instead of the plot for that, almost completely), but what WAS Eli? Why was he castrated? He was only around 200 years old, so it's not like he came from some ancient time with unwritten rituals. Who \"made\" him? And if he'd \"never been dead,\" then...well, what's up with that? The vampires he created were dead/undead, and all the other \"laws\" of vampire mythology seemed to apply to Eli, though he seems, despite his age, to be guessing at what's going on a lot of the time (like when he thought that Hakan couldn't come into the flat without being invited, and was wrong). Anyway, you can tell by how much I want to discuss this book that I found it compelling. Let's just say it's all about the characters. If you're interested in artful writing, you could do a whole lot worse. If you're looking for a pounding, suspenseful, scary, plot-driven STORY, then you might want to just stick to the American Stephen King. ...more You\u2019d think that by now the most recent round of America\u2019s fixation with the undead would have grown as old and withered as a toothless vampire.

Some new fad was supposed to come along and sweep us up by now, leaving only the die-hards and true believers as adherents to this bizarre cult. Unfortunately, with the upcoming New Moon movie promising to underwhelm as ever and HBO just finishing up its second season of True Blood, it seems as though the taste-makers have only begun to whet our appetites for blood-sucking. Yet for every vampire that gets ensnared in Stephenie Meyer\u2019s abhorrent web of chastity and daylight, there remain plenty of opportunities for real vampire horror to tap on our windowpanes and ask to crawl under the covers with us. Such a book is Let The Right One In . Written by Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist, this is a novel that delivers quite genuine chills along with compulsively-lovable characters all at a pace that promises to keep readers hunched over its pages until the final chapter is ended. Oskar is a young boy living in the suburbs of Stockholm. Friendless, picked on mercilessly by his local bullies, epic bladder control issues- this kid is a surefire candidate for the High School Shooter Hall of Fame. Until one night, while imagining himself killing several of his classmates, he meets Eli, the bewildering new girl who lives next door to him and his mother and somehow seems impervious to the cold, only comes out after dark, and has an incredible skill at Rubik\u2019s cubes. Living with her protector, a child molester named Haaken who provides her with fresh blood as long as she accedes to his touches, Eli comes to become a close friend to Oskar, imbuing him with the confidence and sense of worth he needs to stand up for himself against his tormenters while he likewise provides her with the innocent companionship that her young mind so desperately wants (which reminds me of another thing I liked- the author performs a bit of literary jiu-jitsu to circumvent Anne Rice\u2019s Claudia problem of an old vampire being in a child\u2019s body). What makes this book so compulsively readable is the way in which Lindqvist writes his characters. None are truly evil. From the local drunks who one by one fall prey to Eli\u2019s thirst to her pedophile protector, Lindqvist writes his characters as, if not relatable, then as entirely understandable. They act not out of any deep malice but for clearly defined reasons that just seem to inextricably lead to disaster. Watching Lindqvist direct them there, and waiting anxiously to see who will keep breathing and who will simply be a giant vampire juicebox, is an endless amount of fun. I know it\u2019s tough, there is a lot of schlock being put out there trying to cash in on this fad before our attention shifts elsewhere (please to be zombies time again?), but this book should really be a must-read for anyone who has ever been even mildly titillated by the long-fanged. I loved the film as well, but the book was miles above what the movie was capable of. I\u2019ve lent out my copy to a friend but I can\u2019t wait to get it back because I already want to read it again. ...more", "Title": "Let the Right One In"},
