(A note: Of the second group they will also whine when a book from Oprah Book Club 2.1 (ie., the second incarnation of the book club which began with John Steinbeck's East of Eden , and was in it's 2.0 manifestation only going to be for dead authors, but then morphed into 2.1 to include such titles as The Road , and Measure of a Man ) they want to buy is now affixed with the Oprah wrapper or sticker. They will now whine about the little blemish in the same way they whine when the book they now want to read has just been made into a movie and only comes with a movie cover. In both cases these people are bandwagon jumpers but don't want to seem like bandwagon jumpers and by buying the new edition of the book they will be seen as no different from the ignorant masses they so deeply despise. Again they deserve what they get, especially since everyone knows that you can goto a used bookstore and buy an old cover, and if you really need to lie to yourself and everyone around you, you can claim that the 1960's beat up mass-market copy of Steinbeck you bought was really bought by you in a much better condition when you were thirteen, and now you have worn the book down by your constant reading of it, and because of that you know the book soooooo much better than anyone else alive). ...more For 15 years (1996-2010), Oprah Winfrey picked books for her book club.

Wait, Ann-Marie, who? You see, for me, her name does not really ring a bell. Similar to the names of others in the list like Pearl Cleage, Sheri Reynolds, Mary McGarry Morris, Edwidge Danticat, Billie Leats, Bret Lott, Melinda Haynes, Breena Clarke, Gwyn Hayman Rubio and Malika Oufkir. I think, they all became household names because their books were picked by Oprah. What was being included in the Most Influential People lists for so many years if she could not rally people to read her chosen books. I must admit that I read David Wroblewski\u2019s The Story of Edgar Sawtelle and Ken Follett\u2019s The Pillars of the Earth because of Oprah\u2019s stamp. However, I have had no motivation to read right away her other choices including <+++>Fall on Your Knees</+++> because of what Jonathan Franzen said in the interview that Oprah\u2019s picks catered more for readers who were women than men. On the superficial level, that still is my main comment for this book, <+++>Fall on Your Knees</+++> by <---A>Ann-Marie MacDonald</---A>. The story of 3 sisters: Kathleen the eldest. She is beautiful, a musical genius and an apple of the eye of his father; Mercedes , may not be as pretty as her siblings but she stood as the mother for her sisters when their mother died; Frances is as beautiful as Kathleen and she suffered in the hands of their father when the latter came back from the war. Joining them is Lily who is the daughter of Kathleen and a twin of the baby infant Ambrose who accidentally died in the hands of Frances when he and Lily were born. The 3 sisters\u2019 mother, Materia completes the list of female characters. She is the only daughter of a wealthy Lebanese businessman. She defied her parents who wished that she would marry a dentist by eloping with her husband, James . So, the only male main character is the father James who may be good-intentioned and has big dreams for her children but he is weak to resist temptation and to overcome the psychological effects of war. So, there you go: 5 strong female characters versus 1 weak male character. So the mostly female adorers of Oprah cheer and clap their hands when Oprah raises the book and says \u201cHail, hail, read this book as I could not keep my hands from flipping over the pages while reading this!\u201d However, for me, there are three saving graces for this book. And this maybe the reason why Oprah just flipped and flipped the pages till the wee hours of the morning: 1. Brilliant first chapter that begins with \u201cThey are all dead now\u201d then you follow the camera that zooms in to the things that the previous occupants of the house possessed and used. 2.<---F> Character-driven plot</---F>. Mac-Donald\u2019s characters are bigger than the old familiar themes (family love, sisterly love, incest, war, etc) that we have all seen in the movies and read in similar books. Jane Smiley\u2019s A Thousand Acres easily came to my mind. For one, MacDonald was never melodramatic and you don\u2019t close the book feeling emotionally cheated. 3. Having said that, the denouement is well-handled. The use of the family tree not only wraps up the whole story but it provides the symbolism of the book\u2019s main theme: family love , that no matter what we do, at the end of our lives, what matters most is our family. Then when you close the book, you know who the narrator of the first chapter should be. Well thought of novel. Well organized. Well written. For a first time writer, this is just amazing. Now, I no longer wonder why the Boxall\u2019s 1001 editors chose this book over the more popular Oprah titles like The Story of Edgar Sawtelle, The Pillars of the Earth, The Road, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, East of Eden, I Know This Much is True, She\u2019s Come Undone or The Deep End of the Ocean . ...more OMG, I hated this book.

I felt that I had to read for days in order to get the jest of what she wrote about 30-50 pages back. It was ridiculous.

Warning Spoiler Alert - Not until the last pages do we find out the talented daughter's twins (she died in childbirth) were fathered by her father - sick, sick, sick.

MacDonald's writing style creates an interactive world that pulls you in to first person view of the characters' lives. The story follows the Piper family, a unique little set up of father and four daughters. Mr. Piper's wife has passed, leaving him to fend for himself in a home bursting to the seams with the drama of being a young girl growing up with three other sisters. Kathleen, the eldest of the girls, has been sent away to live out her father's vision of fame and perfection with her glorious voice. Left behind are Frances (a fiesty middle child who lives by her own rules), Lily (the youngest of the four, living with a crippled leg and a strong desire to please and do good), and Mercedes (the second eldest, longing to take the place of their late mother and following her faith closely and fiercely). Each girl has their own story which is brimming with secrets that are both outrageous and real. Mystery is around every corner, and controversy hides behind each one. If I had to describe it in one word, it would be \"intense\". Every story is intertwined in surprising and unexpected ways. It's difficult to not fall in love with someone in the novel because there really is somebody for everyone to relate to. If you can stomach some harsh reality with believable characters in a world covered with a dark veil of the unexpected, then this book may be the right way to go. ...more Lily stays sitting. \u201cFrances.

I need to keep reminding myself about this fact that it's a debut novel because it is a polished work of complexity and beauty. Fall on Your Knees, set in Cape Breton at in the first half of the 20th century, tells the story of Materia, Kathleen, Mercedes, Frances, and Lily - i.e. all the women of the Piper family. Each woman has a voice, a distinct history, a distinct outlook on life - and a distinct fate. So, really this is a novel with five main characters - not to mention James, who dwells at the centre of all their lives. This book has so many layers that it was easy to be sucked into the world of the Pipers. But it is not a comfortable place. Far from it, it is a world full of harshness, brutality, and abuse, where each of the characters is trying to escape the confines of what holds them. Be it religion, loyalty, or something else - each character has their own form of imprisonment. \"God did not put me on this earth to stand by while my sister Frances is killed. Beaten is one thing. Wrongly touched is one thing. Stabbed with a bayonet is another. Push. Be strong enough to carry the burden of sin that goes with doing the right thing. There is only one saint in this family and I\u2019m not it. God has made Mercedes a judge. No one loves you for that. Not like a crippled child who\u2019s prone to visions. Whom Mercedes prizes. Not like a fallen woman who makes people laugh. Whom Mercedes loves.\" When reading some of the reviews, the aspect that I have picked up on most is that people have read this because it was an Oprah bookclub read. I am usually hesitant to follow up hyped up books, but sometimes, just sometimes, they are a exactly the type of book that will work their way into your soul. Fall on Your Knees is a perfectly constructed family saga, but it is also more than this. It is a beautifully sketched insight into the human condition. Mercedes is neither a saint nor a sinner. She is somewhere in between. She is why purgatory was invented. ...more I discovered Ann-Marie MacDonald by accident, when I bought The Way the Crow Flies in a used bookstore during a biblioemergency.

I read Fall on Your Knee second and had that wonderful enjoyment of a second shot of a writer who you liked so much the first time you didn't think you could have that pleasure again. Not only was Fall On Your Knees similarly satisfying, but it was uniquely satisfying for AMM's ability to create a nearly perfect gothic novel, along with all her other amazing traits. If I had to compare her to another writer, it would be Annie Proulx for her ability to give great reading plasure from the darkest of stories. ...more Actually, I give this sort of a three b/c the author's style was oddly skillful, as a story though, it left a bitter taste in my mouth.

And the ending was unsatisfying regarding every character, except for Frances's son. Hmm...I think I'll be puzzling over this one for awhile, and maybe that was the author's goal. If so, then I give her 5 stars. I guess the best way to describe this book is mostly interesting, and extremely unsettling.

(view spoiler) [the only thing i really do not understand is why frances wanted to have a kid, and to have it with ginger. i truly have no clue. (hide spoiler) ] it is also an extraordinarily quirky and strange novel, though i've seen reviewers say that it is a straight and ordinary read. this is my explanation: canadian literature is invariably quirky, but if you are canadian you won't notice it. that's how we know which reviewers are canadians. it took me two weeks to read this. it's a long time. frances' adventures, while fascinating and absolutely crazy, didn't draw me in enough to pull long reading stretches and i think that overall the novel might have gained from being shorter and on fewer tracks. but i'm quibbling. this story belongs to mercedes, frances, and lily. materia is sacrificed at the altar of the multi-generational format, which is a shame because her madness is so, so interesting. women stay alive by going mad. it happens in books over and over. it happens in life. we stay alive by going mad. but the story belongs to the three sisters and this is an exceptional sister story. this is what it shows: that sisterhood (the familial kind) is tremendously powerful but also a force so strong that it must be reined in gently and firmly, and never allowed to get out of control. sisterhood can keep you sane and happy and make you feel deeply loved in the midst of terrible mayhem -- and kill you the next moment. i speak as someone who has three sisters. sisters who have survived three or four world wars together may not be able to remain good to each other. when their love turns poisonous, they can choose to stay and be poisoned, or leave. there is an extraordinary act of love toward the end. it concerns frances and lily. watch for it. i don't know what it is with the violence of fathers. i wish i knew. this book is listed here on goodreads in many lesbian lists. if you are reading it for the lesbian story you'll have to wait a good long time, because it takes place at the very end. if it had been stuck in the middle, fewer people might have remembered it and thus bothered to classify this book as a lesbian book. there is a queer undertone under all of it, though, and the lesbian story is extremely beautiful. still, i would not consider this a lesbian book. i think i may be done with anne-marie macdonald. i have spent two weeks with her and her mind has blown mine, but i don't feel a great need to spend another 800 pages in her company (she has written only two novels). i may, however, read her plays. lily piper may be one of the most fabulous literary creations of all time. ...more This book left me wanting to slash my wrists-- especially when I think about the time I spent reading it that I can never get back.

I felt let down as every male character in the book was more than faulted. Each man had abandoned responsibility for a brief something....Sex, Money, alcohol. Family values and true love among the men were not present. A child's welfare did not matter. Perhaps MacDonald has been wronged by a number of men in her life....if that is so it shows in FYK.

C' \u00e8 pi\u00f9 della storia di una vita di una persona in quello che butta nel cestino, in come sistema le sue cose, o come accoppia i colori di quella che potrete mai trovare in qualsiasi altra cosa. I dettagli sono importanti perch\u00e9 distinguono una persona da un' altra, una storia da un' altra. Questo mi fa venire in mente quando da piccola dopo essermi cacciata sotto le coperte e aver lasciato solo fuori il naso (per pure esigenze respiratorie si intende) cos\u00ec da essere protetta da eventuali attacchi notturni da parte di agguerritissimi mostri (la cui visione di Monsters and Co. mi aveva confermato l' indubitabile presenza) pretendevo la mia brava storia della buonanotte come la pi\u00f9 ordinaria delle bimbe. E quindi si ripartiva di nuovo con cappuccetto rosso o biancaneve o con l' evergreen Andersen i cui tragici finali ohim\u00e9 mi hanno sempre ammaliata. Tuttavia per ogni storia,ogni volta, c' era qualcosa di diverso in me, o nella storia stessa, nei particolari della storia, se questa veniva narrata oralmente senza prenderla da alcun libro. Rose che ad un certo punto di questo libro, quasi alla fine, devo dire, conoscerete, dice una cosa che mi ha colpita ma con la quale posso solo parzialmente dichiararmi d' accordo: \"Non sono una compositrice. Metto insieme delle note sul momento.\" Io le ho detto che questo si chiama comporre, ma lei ha ribattuto che non scrive mai la musica. Ogni volta \u00e8 diversa. \"Allora la scriva\" e lei \"No\" \"Perch\u00e9\" ho chiesto. \"Perch\u00e9 cos\u00ec uccidi l' uccello\" fa lei. Rose ha ragione, per un certo verso, non si pu\u00f2 mai replicare la magia di un singolo momento in musica, per quanto tu possa riascoltare sempre e sempre la stessa canzone, ogni secondo che passa in ogni riascolto avr\u00e0 una valenza diversa. Per\u00f2, appunto per questo, anche se la musica \u00e8 sempre quella, sempre la stessa successione di note, cambia la maniera in cui \"ci veste\". E cosa \u00e8 questo se non un particolare? La stessa cosa dicasi per le storie, potrei dire che questa \u00e8 una delle tante saghe familiari al mondo, da Marquez a Irving passando per la Ginzburg facendo una capatina anche per Eugenides. Potrei dirlo, ma quanti particolari trascurerei e quanta magia gli toglierei. Magia, che nelle saghe famigliari c'\u00e8 sempre, perch\u00e9 cosa \u00e8 che ci consente di stare ancora insieme senza farci fuori se non un pizzico di un particolare tipo di magia? Perdetevici dentro, nei vostri momenti scandalizzati, impietosi, pietosi, felici, simpatizzanti e non, e buona lettura. Sono proprio curiosa di sapere per chi simpatizzerete. Lei dice che la musica \u00e8 gi\u00e0 nell\u2019 aria e sta a noi aprirle un accesso nel nostro mondo per poterla ascoltare . Come se il mondo fosse pieno di musica che non riusciamo a sentire \u201ca orecchio nudo\u201d. Cos\u00ec oggi a lezione ho pensato: d\u2019 accordo, la canzone come andrebbe cantata sta scintillante intorno a me come aria nel deserto, io non devo fare altro che accoglierla. Allora ho chiuso gli occhi e mi sono aperta lasciando che la canzone mi attraversasse e ho pensato: \u201c nom cantarla, liberala\u201d. Quando ho finito, il kaiser ha annuito. Ho guardato Rose, che ha rivolto un minuscolo sorriso ai tasti. ...more Ormai sono morti tutti.

E' un libro crudo e doloroso, eppure in grado di tenerti l\u00ec incollato alle pagine, con un desiderio quasi perverso di andare avanti e scoprire quali altre disgrazie aspettino la famiglia Piper: perch\u00e8 ad ogni pagina c'\u00e8 un elemento che ti fa piangere il cuore. Tutto inizia con la fuga d'amore di James, 18 anni, e Materia, 13, gi\u00e0 promessa in sposa ad un altro uomo. La famiglia di Materia non li perdoner\u00e0 tanto facilmente, anzi: il padre la maledice e la disereda. La maledizione ha effetto: Il marito si si pente di averla sposata, si vergogna a farsi vedere in giro con lei e quando nasce Kathleen, sua pupilla, non la tocca nemmeno pi\u00f9. I drammi della famiglia non finiscono: un parto difficile, la morte di Kathleen per parto, il suicidio di Materia perch\u00e9 ha peccato: ha salvato i due bambini e non Kathleen (Che in cuor suo, non \u00e8 mai riuscita ad amare); il maldestro tentativo di una bimba di sei anni di battezzare i nipotini, la stessa bambina che, cresciuta, \u00e8 incapace di farsi amare e con tutta probabilit\u00e0, di amare a sua volta. (Per\u00f2 la stimo: le sue bambole hanno dei nomi assurdi: Scarlattina, Rose Difterite, i marinai gemelli Tifo e TBC Vedetta, Vaiolo, La Spagnola e Colera La France). Mercedes \u00e8 una bambina stupenda: credo di non aver mai provato tanta tenerezza e amore per nessun personaggio letterario. L'adotterei, se fosse possibile. A 7 anni, quando la mamma si suicida, il padre le affida la cura della sorellina (6 anni) e della nipotina (appena nata), e si trova a crescere improvvisamente, senza l'aiuto di nessuno. Si fa carico delle sorelle, del padre (Che cerca sempre di soddisfare in un modo cos\u00ec commovente che ci sarebbe da piangere), della casa e dei veterani della guerra. Continuando ovviamente ad andare a scuola. Ha una pazienza e una bont\u00e0 infinite, roba che Gandhi dovrebbe solo che prendere lezioni. Purtroppo lo stile della MacDonal non \u00e8 quello che si dice perfetto: passa dal passato al presente, passando dalla terza alla prima persona in modo a volte confusionario.. A volte poi i dialoghi non sono nemmeno virgolettati. Ma per il grande impatto che d\u00e0 la storia, ad Ann-Marie si perdona tutto. La V stellina \u00e8 perch\u00e9 l'intera vicenda si svolge nel mio amato Canada, e pi\u00f9 precisamente nella Nova Scotia, dove ho passato 6 mesi della mia vita.. Insomma, l'ho sentito super vicino. :) Ah, la V stellina \u00e8 anche per il fatto che la famiglia di Materia ha origine arabe, dal Libano, pi\u00f9 precisamente, e quindi nel testo sono frequenti frasi in arabo.. Ho molto apprezzato, anche se ne ho capite la met\u00e0!! ...more I read this book because my partner and I have an agreement.

I had this book on my shelf for over three years before attempting to read it, wondering how the author would sustain my interest over its 560-plus pages. And, once making the bold attempt to finally pick-up the book, I had difficulty putting it down at times. The novel is visual, reminiscent of a screenplay. MacDonald uses a variety of techniques to hook the reader: the rapid mixing of tenses and point-of-view, anchoring the story along pivotal events and replaying those scenes from different vantage points like different camera angles applied for the same screen shot, hiding information in scenes and gradually revealing more clues in subsequent takes of the same scene, using combinations of journal, memory, snappy and irreverent dialogue and tight unconventional narrative that focuses on visual imagery rather than on syntactical propriety - yes, a masterful performance for a first novel, and great learning for emerging novelists. This story has a resemblance to the King Lear tale but is not as obvious as in recent re-takes such as Jane Smiley's \"A Thousand Acres\". The patriarch, James Piper, marries a Lebanese child-bride and begets daughters, some whose mothers are unclear until the end. There is Kathleen the budding opera singer, Frances the evil one, Mercedes the pious one, and the crippled Lilly the saint. Incest is at the core, which hobbles and fractures the family over a time horizon spanning the dawn of the twentieth century to the 1950's Pivotal events such as Kathleen's tragic birthing of twins and its series of catastrophic aftershocks, Frances' shooting and the events that precede and follow, the unravelling of what happened to Kathleen in New York - are all launching points to move the story forward and grip the reader in a non-stop read. The four sisters emerge gradually from their childhood as the indistinguishable offspring of James Piper, into fully flushed characters with different personalities and histories over the time span of this novel. Unfortunately, Momma, or Materia their Lebanese mother, gets no accolades for the girls' destiny, apart from a few Arabic words they banter around, and the occasional Middle Eastern dish they prepare for James. Daddy, in his twisted, well meaning way, gets all the credit for the disasters that befell their lives. A great read, I recommend it. ...more I cannot recommend this book.

I kept replaying the scenes over and over and over again. It really bothered me. I don't like artsy descriptions of horrible perversion. One part of this book that I LOVED was in a marital-infidelity situation. The husband was systematically, purposefully seduced by a rather messed-up younger woman. He was a good man, a good father, and found himself in a very bad situation. Afterwards, he ran straight to his wife and told her. He was repentent, miserable. She instantly forgave him. She knew it would never happen again. And it didn't. It was a very cool concept that their marriage, their family was bigger than a moment of weakness. What he did was horrible. But to her, it wasn't horrible enough to lose what they had. I really admired this idea. It's not how we look at marriage very much today and it was refreshing. I enjoyed her writing style, obviously I was sucked in enough to read through it, but my heart was really dark and cloudy for a few days after reading it. Won't touch it again. ...more This five-star rating is the one I gave Ann-Marie MacDonald's powerhouse first novel the first time around, but I confess I was remembering and rating it at a great distance.

As the book wraps up it just pulls you in like passing a bad car accident. You know it's going to be disturbing and hard to watch but you can't look away. Fall On Your Knees (Oprah #45)The book follows the Piper family from the late 1890's through several generations of increasingly disturbed individuals. In the beginning of the book James Piper is a piano tuner who ends up running away with Materia Mahmoud, the daughter of one of his clients. Oh, did I mention that Materia is a mere 12 going on 13 at the time? What comes from their union is the stuff that episodes of Maury Povich are made of. Incest, lies, deception, secrets, and more drama than you can shake a stick at. James is ambitious, self righteous and a bit of a pedophile. His wife Materia is simple, a little childish and resentful of the path her life has taken. They have three daughters as different as can be. Kathleen, the oldest and the apple of daddy's eye who has an operatic voice of an angel and she knows it. Frances, the wild child and Mercedes, who is very pious and good and who tries desperately to keep her family in line and together but she ends up being sucked into the depravity too, by the end of the book. I didn't think I would like this book at first. None of the main characters are like-able. In fact, most of the smaller characters are unlike-able as well. These are deeply flawed individuals, making horrible choice after horrible choice and yet I became invested in their story. Like a bad talk show, the book is filled with many OMG and WTF moments and even a few that left me asking \"Wait....WHAT?\" as I frantically read on to see what was going to happen next. Of course I don't get my answers till much later in the book. Ann-Marie MacDonald often reveals major events early but doesn't show the journey that led to those events until much later. The point of view shifts often and you may think you know the story as you read it from one POV, you find that you were very mistaken as the same events is retold through a different character. It kept me guessing and as I finished the book I realized that all was definitely not as it seemed. It was an extremely dark book, I disliked all the characters and there are very few happy moments but I ended up loving it. ...more Where do I even start with this one? This is heavy, heavy stuff, full to the brim with family secrets. And some of these are some pretty hardcore secrets. When asked by a co-worker what I was reading lately, I barely knew what to say - \"Well, this book about a family, and their gross father, and there's a lot of incest...\" But while there is definitely a very strong undercurrent of incesty feelings and behavior running through the entire novel, there is much more to it.

When asked by a co-worker what I was reading lately, I barely knew what to say - \"Well, this book about a family, and their gross father, and there's a lot of incest...\" But while there is definitely a very strong undercurrent of incesty feelings and behavior running through the entire novel, there is much more to it. It's hard to give a high level summary of the plot without diving into all of the intricacies. Basically, it's a family saga about 4 sisters and their father living in Cape Breton that spans maybe 30-40 years (I'm too lazy to officially work out the timeline in my head!) There are several main events that you learn about slowly, by jumping back and forth in time until all of the mysteries are finally revealed. This storytelling device works well here - it never feels disjointed, and makes it more exciting (as well as, admittedly, icky). None of the (main) characters are particularly likeable. They all have some redeeming qualities - Frances is bright and vivacious and fun before her rebellious behavior just becomes over the top, Mercedes really is just trying to take care of her family, even as she comes off as overly pious and condescending, and Lily is altogether innocent, but she does certain things that make you want to strangle her. Even Materia, who is for the most part a victim forced into a strange and vaguely sadistic marriage at the age of 12, didn't elicit full sympathy from me. Often, not connecting with any of the characters on a personal level ruins a book for me, but in this case I was completely fascinated. Having had a very normal childhood with very normal parents and a sister, reading about a family like this was compelling and satisfyingly twisted. To me, this book was dark and sad, but there was a beautiful quality to it too. It wasn't necessarily the best time for me to read it, as the weather is finally becoming sunny and gorgeous - I feel this type of sordid book is more suited for the dark depths of winter. The prose is hazy and wistful and sad, and it's just such a good story. I'm sorry that it took me so long to become aware of this book and to pick it up, and at 584 pages it was an effort, but it was well, well worth it. ...more A novel I remember reading, and having a difficult time to put down. And didn't, very often, despite the 500-plus pages... I'm giving this book five stars because I can't find it in me to give it any less. I wouldn't say that I enjoyed this book, a well written tale so wrought with lost dreams, pining for the love of a father, incest, depression, longing, the blurred line between love and hate... I will say that I'm grateful for having read it. I loved this book! It was beautiful, witty, poignant, sad and educational.James was a sick,sick man. Families can really have so many dark secrets.

As it should, the story unfolds in waves. There are moments of playfulness and humor, and others where the tide of pain comes down so strong, slightly unexpected, and, for a second, the feeling of drowning, only to return to the surface, rejoicing, for calmer approaching moments. Now, I started by saying that this story is massive. It really is, and I'm not trying to say that I'm intimidated by 508 pages, because I'm not. I'm still digesting it, and I don't think I'll ever fully consume the entire thing. AHHH the importance of titles and the 1st line of every novel. FALL ON YOUR KNEES- (did anyone else read w/ Celine Dion's voice in the back of their head? No one?) \"They're all dead now.\" The story, or prologue, opens with highlighting objects and photos that seem to evoke voices of distant memories. We are then launched into James Piper's story and his arrival at Cape Breton. Well, Sydney 1st. James is a diligent young man, 15 or so, and imagines making a new life of his own. He envisions a family of his own \"filled with music and the silence of good books.\" He becomes a piano tuner, which grants him the introduction of Materia. It's love at first sight for him, and they quickly elope and plan to move away to NYC, unbeknownst to her parents. She's 12, going on 13 and already promised to someone else. So you can only imagine the rage and shame Mahmoud, Materia's father felt, and understand why (despite custom) he banished them (with a home of their own). And like every other angry person, Mahmoud curses them, the home, and Materia's womb. *shakes fist & looks off into the distance* I'm not trying to make it seem like this story has secret gypsies, spirits, or magical beings that will free them from the upcoming events. There are spirits in this story. Spirits in another sense. A lot of things seems to be alive, and alive on their own. They move into the house on Water street. The romance never kindles, despite James's attempts. He builds her a hope chest, to which she leaves empty. The smell reminds her of her family, but James takes her lack of use of it, among other things as her choice not to be a good wife. They eventually have Kathleen. Kathleen is beautiful, and proves to be a very talented singer as she gets older. By then James has already transferred his love for his wife to just love for his daughter. He looks at Materia w/ shame and disgust, often wondering why/ how they were together in the 1st place. The downfall of a family comes sins of the father. James has transferred dreams for Kathleen. He pushes her to become a worldwide success. Kathleen is an alienated, child prodigy, who continues to develop into an incredibly beautiful, snobby, talented, young woman. Eventually war consumes their town and the world around it. James goes off to fight his demons or run from them He returns to have Kathleen sent away to NYC to continue her path of success, and rekindle love w/ Materia. They have Mercedes- a good delicate child, and Frances- nothing but a heathen. I LOVE FRANCES!!!!! Materia, takes this as a second chance from God. She has done nothing but care for the house, resent Kathleen, and take abuse from James prior to the new babies. She has thrown herself into being some what of a religious mute, speaking (mostly arabic) when necessary, and seeking mercy and understanding from God. (postpartum depression) Things get rocky as Kathleen is suddenly brought home from NYC, pregnant. The story continues to spiral from these events, (Lily is born- Mumma & two babies are dead) and we watch the characters all come into their own, filling the hope chest with their pain and memories, and secrets unfold until the book closes. And like the sea, it is difficult finding the beginning or where it truly ends... I won't say more on that because it is really good, and definitely worth enduring. MacDonald created amazing, well developed characters, and a really good plot. I found myself the same way I felt when I read Jane Eyre; I know the ending is coming, a lot has happened, this is good and I don't want it to end but I want to know what is what. Oh! 250 pgs to go. What I will say is there are so many parallels, metaphors, symbolism, and significant elements throughout the book that I can go on for days and days, but for a few points: - The hope chest is like Pandora's box to some extent. When opened it brought happiness to some, and painful memories to others until they found redemption - Redemption : To do something that compensates for the faults or bad aspects of poor or past behavior. FALL ON YOUR KNEES- ask for forgiveness... a)Mahmoud redeemed himself to some extent when he gave his banished family a home and extended a hand for their 1st born's music lessons. He also redeemed himself by allowing the younger children to marry happily, excusing some customs and embracing the difference. He loses the 1st two, Materia & Camille, but Camille (happily widowed) comes back and Mahmoud gets just desserts. b) James doesn't exactly find his until he apologizes and tries to make it right by embracing what family really means and showing them. (red boots, giving Frances Kathleen's book) c) I'm still digesting this part, because I'm still peeved w/ Mercedes- but why should I be mad w/ her when she has redeemed herself- to an extent-with her sisters and attempted to make it all right with the family tree & Lourdes fund. (Lourdes fund? Lord's fund... that might be a stretch) -Acknowledgement of humanity--- compassion We are all human, broken in some way at birth, and we will go back into the earth or wash up into the sea just as we came. & ultimately we are all related, sheesh nearly every character! I kept asking, \"why are we discussing them in depth. I get it, she's pissed because she lost her job etc, & and she's mad because another woman is after her man...\" Now I get it. - Do we have control over what exactly we become, or are some things inevitable? (Abuse is at the hands of the creator, there is no excuse for such acts of violence. Violence begets violence & hate is always learned) & as I mentioned before about the parallels and the way the story weaves... It was interesting seeing Materia throw herself into religion & Mercedes become religious. Materia was a little wild, and Frances received all of those gifts. I can't help but think that Kathleen maybe took after James's mother. They all definitely had their father's strong will and diligence. I caught myself comparing Mahmoud and James a lot. The way they both came into a marriage, how they arrived on the island, how they lead their families and how they came out of their faults. I also compared Materia's resentment towards Kathleen and the likeness of that in Mercedes's resentment towards Lily. In all, it was a very good read. I often felt like I was watching ER again, the way the voices faded into one another in a scene just by the touch of an object or the path a person took passing by. I wasn't really left with too many questions, more or less \"whys and I wonder if.\" I think I felt a little guilt, too. Mrs. Luvovitz did, wishing she had spoken up sooner... I, too, had no idea about Frances's grief until the end. & now I'm wondering (& I think I know) who Pete was & where he came from. When I finished last night, I immediately started flipping through Wuthering Heights, looking for something, I'm still not sure. I just wonder what the significance was with Mercedes & Frances hiding precious items in the Charlotte and Emily Bronte's books; & I flipped because I forgot about the epigraph at the very beginning of the book from Wuthering Heights... I will be re-reading that in the very near future. For the sins of the father, I wonder if this is why he never recieves a son of his own... I give it 3 stars (plus or minus one). I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it might be in my top 5 (that, I'm still developing) but I wasn't too keen or disappointed at how the ending came about. Like the ending of a good song, or leaving the beach, I'm just glad I experienced it. ...more This book is one of those books that you either love it or hate it. I loved it.

If you don't take any enjoyment from stories that talk about incest or other related but depressing topics, then this book is not for you.

This is a book that I will always turn to when I want to reread a favorite. ...more This had a lot of wonderful thoughts, but I got bogged down and don't think I'll finish it.
