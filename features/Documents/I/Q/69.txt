Do you?\" He took her hand and put it on his jeans, where how much he wanted to was immediately evident. A minute later he was poised above her, resting on his elbows. She took him in hand to guide him in. \"Take it easy on me, Colonel Barbara. I've kind of forgotten how this thing goes.\" \"It's like riding a bicycle,\" Barbie said. Turned out he was right. anyway... the good? gobs of it. what king might lack in his basic presentation of human behavior he almost makes up for in his evocation of a kind of horrible and ineffable beauty. amidst this mash-up of sci-fi & political allegory there are scenes of true beauty and a kind of gritty poetry as the town descends into a Hobbesian nightmare. one that sticks out: as pollutants and dust and pollen collect on the roof of the invisible dome, the townspeoples' view of the sky is skewed, the sky itself appears... different. sunsets seem as when a volcano explodes, a deep rich burning red. and the night sky? a meteor shower appears as streams of pink and red slashing the sky to bits. and minus the 'leatherhead' parts, the final 'fireball and survivor' sequence haunted the hell outta me. some seriously horrifying stuff. so, yeah. my first foray into stephen king. badass bestseller horror iconic motherfucker and inspiration behind this terrific terrific terrific song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3J0i... i read 1072 pages in just under a week and that's no small feat. i'd like to share a beer, mr. king, get to know you. do i wanna tear through your oeuvre? we'll see... *that my own 'apocalyptic literature' portmanteau, thank you very much ...more \u0647\u0644 \u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0644\u0650\u0645 \u0642\u0635\u0651

Sure, I've read The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon , but only because it was described as a young adult novel (King-lite, if you will). I have spent most of my life actively avoiding Stephen King and here's my story as to why Mr. King and I parted ways before I even read anything by him. When I was but a wee little girl, full of innocence and a precocious love of reading, my mom was also a voracious reader. As I was consuming Little House on the Prairie books (my earliest encounter with book rape--thanks, grandma) and Nancy Drew, I began noticing that mom was always reading these big ass books with KING running down the spine. When she wasn't reading these books, they were always placed on top of the refrigerator which was well out of my grasp. Eager for us to share this love of reading (Mom curiously had no interest in the plight of the Ingalls family), I begged and pleaded to be allowed to read the King books. \"Gee, wouldn't it be fun if Mom and I read the same books? Then we could talk about them!\" I thought. Days, weeks, months went by and, eventually, my constant wheedling became too much. She relented, but the deal was that she would pick the scene I was allowed to read. She chose a particularly horrific and descriptive scene from The Stand . I read with increasing horror--Nancy Drew never encountered messed up shit like this! When I finished that scene, I handed the book over and never asked to read King again. And I stepped lightly around Mom from that day forward. I suddenly understood that, if that woman snapped, it would be ugly--and she would know what to do with the bodies. Therefore, unlike most teenagers, I skipped over the desire to consume everything King between junior high and high school. And this brings us to present day and my first King novel. At 1,072 pages, this is definitely a doorstop of a book. However, it reads fairly quickly. My main complaint is that many of the characters are one dimensional stereotypes. There are no shades of gray in the small town of Chester's Mill. At first, this bothered me; however, I think maybe individual characters had to be sacrificed in order to portray the real character--small town America and how it reacts to cataclysmic events. If King shorthands individual characterizations, he nails the panic and herd-like mentality that takes over when uncertainty is the order of the day. The premise of the novel, as blatantly presented by the title, is that Chester's Mill one day finds itself cutoff from the outside world by a mysterious dome that perfectly conforms itself to the borders of Chester's Mill. In the days ahead, the people wait and worry as the United States government desperately tries to free them. As hope begins to dwindle, reason is in short supply as people trade in their humanity for mass hysteria and panic. The dome is not, however, the ultimate villain in this tale. The real villain is Big Jim Rennie, the town selectman who has been waiting for just such a \"clustermug\" so that he can claim control of the town. Big Jim is the most vile type of Christian, one who believes that being able to quote scripture and abstain from saying cuss words is all it takes to be amongst God's chosen. Big Jim does everything in the belief that God is on his side and damn anyone who tries to get in his way, for not only are they his enemies, but enemies of Christianity itself. It is possible to have religion without true faith, and Big Jim is proof of that. He has customized his religion to serve his needs; indeed, his belief in God is little more than a manifestation of his own belief in himself as superior, as \"chosen,\" to be above all others. It appears that my review may be destined to be as long as the book, so I'll cut it short. Weaknesses: there are a few clunker sentences that pulled me out of the story, there is an abundance of detail that I could have lived without, and I was disappointed in the reason for the dome because it seemed so obvious. Strengths: King deftly keeps his cast of characters straight and realistically interacting with one another, he captures the terror and bovine-like stupidity that takes over when day-to-day life is disrupted and threatened, there are some colorful cuss words that I hope to employ in the near future, and there's a catastrophic scene toward the end that is one of the most terrifying and well-written that I've ever read.

The area is completely cut off from any outside help. Resources are limited. People are confused and scared. And Dick Cheney is in charge\u2026. That terrifying idea is what makes <+++>Under the Dome</+++> one of the best books King has done. Chester\u2019s Mill, Maine, is a typical Stephen King small town, filled with people both good and criminally insane. One fall day, a force-field crashes down around the area, causing a fair amount of carnage and disaster. The Dome is quickly found to be impenetrable, and while the townspeople can communicate with the outside world via cell phones or wireless internet, they\u2019re essentially on their own. If the situation wasn\u2019t bad enough, the town is now in the hands of Big Jim Rennie. Forget about Randall Flagg or Annie Wilkes or the Crimson King or Pennywise the Clown. Big Jim, a used car salesman and town selectman, is King\u2019s scariest villain ever. Why? Because America lived through a Big Jim-like reign after 9/11, and it\u2019s all too easy to picture how much worse it could have gotten while reading this book. King isn\u2019t very subtle in the allegory here. Chester\u2019s Mill is the stand-in for America, and Big Jim is obviously based on Cheney, a corrupt political weasel hiding behind the dim-witted first selectman of the town as a front to cover up his shenanigans. He doesn\u2019t drink or smoke and talks about his love for Jesus, but Big Jim is utterly ruthless about destroying his enemies. And to Big Jim, just disagreeing with him makes you an enemy. Big Jim has spent years refusing to spend money on needed town improvements while involved in all kinds of criminal enterprises. While he demands total power and authority, he\u2019s actually completely incompetent at leadership except for placing blame and manipulating people. When the Dome comes down, his first concern is covering up his criminal activity, but he quickly realizes that with the outside world at bay, he can create his own little dictatorship inside the bubble. And of course, he\u2019s doing it for the good of the town. A small group of people realize what Rennie is doing and try to stop him, but they vastly overestimate what the threat of eventual punishment from the outside will do. They just can\u2019t believe that anyone would actually go as far as Big Jim is prepared to do, and while the federal government tries in vain to assert its authority, Big Jim is all too happy to thumb his nose at them and continue to consolidate power even as the air inside the Dome is getting awfully stale. King\u2019s always been terrific at depicting the strengths and weaknesses of a small town in books like \u2018Salem\u2019s Lot or Needful Things, but this is something different. He claims that he\u2019s had the idea for this book since the mid-70s, but never completed it because the science of what would happen within the Dome was beyond him. Delay may have been a blessing, I don\u2019t think this would have been the same book if it wasn\u2019t for the Bush/Cheney administration after 9/11. It\u2019s being routinely pointed out in various reviews that the plot here is eerily similar to The Simpson\u2019s Movie where the government puts a giant dome over polluted Springfield. I\u2019ve read an interview where King claims that he had no idea about this until the book was written and someone told him. I\u2019m going to cry bullshit on that. He writes a column about pop culture for Entertainment Weekly and has played himself on the show. I find it really hard to believe that he somehow missed The Simpson\u2019s Movie having a giant dome in it. It\u2019s very weird that none of the people within the Dome ever mention the movie since King has never been shy about incorporating pop culture references before. But that\u2019s nitpicking and doesn\u2019t change the fact that this story and Big Jim scared the crap out of me. (I grew up in a small town, and I could easily think of some of the locals who would have tried to take over after a crisis if left unchecked, and some of them probably would have been worse than Big Jim and his crowd of hand-picked bullies.) Although this is a huge book and King has been bad about over-writing in the past, this one flies by and I actually found myself wanting a little more detail about some of the people since many of them don\u2019t get much of a wrap up. I was a shade disappointed in the eventual explanation to the cause of the Dome, and how it is resolved, but overall, this is going to end up being one of my favorite Stephen King books. ...more in brief, because i am nearly starting my first day of readers advisory class (yay!) and i have to prepare mentally for the schoolplace after the long break, plus i'm not really in the mood to write this review what with salinger and all casting a pall over my day, but book report compulsion gets the best of me, so. this book ... whole lotta length, not much depth. and as any lady will tell you...etc etc... i don't have a problem with stephen king. i stopped reading him when i was a teenager not in brief, because i am nearly starting my first day of readers advisory class (yay!) and i have to prepare mentally for the schoolplace after the long break, plus i'm not really in the mood to write this review what with salinger and all casting a pall over my day, but book report compulsion gets the best of me, so. this book ... whole lotta length, not much depth. and as any lady will tell you...etc etc... i don't have a problem with stephen king. i stopped reading him when i was a teenager not because i felt \"better\" than him or was too snobby for mass market fiction, but because gerald's game was so so so laughably bad that i could not carry on. oh, god even thinking about it now makes me chuckle a little bit. go, read it - it is dreadful. but the stand i think is a bunch of fun, and i have read that one a number of times. king is also the only author to terrify me to this day with a story i read when i was about 7 or 8 on my way to the fair (yeah, i know, but what better to read trapped in a car on the way to some fair?) and even thinking about it now (the boogeyman) gives me delicious shivers. this one started off pretty good - engaging plot, fast-paced, numerous characters to keep straight in the head. but then...it just goes nowhere while going everywhere, you know? much of it seems tacked-on, in a way. he attempts to give the characters more dimensions than they deserve and he somehow fails to follow through with this promise. by trying to complicate them, he makes their shallowness stand out even more. bad guys melt in the face of abandoned children, good guys have secret shady pasts... but i'm not buying it. all the action takes place in about a week, even though this thing is the size of the bible (which is much more willing to sacrifice some details in the interest of economy; learn from god , s.k; we like a little mystery....) i am a huge fan of the \"aftermath\" novel, but i think i prefer a little more time to have passed before the story begins... when we had the blackout here in nyc, and we allll had to walk home to our respective boroughs, vendors were handing out bottled water along the way and the atmosphere was actually kind of fun. if this had lasted longer than it did, those vendors would probably be huddled in their bodegas, guarding their chips and gum like gold... and that's when it gets interesting. it's true there is some bad behavior in this book. some hugely antisocial behavior. but no one seems panic-stricken, until provoked. come on, maine, act like survivors!! stop making pancakes for everyone and hoard some shit. there are cool moments - how the dome affects pacemakers is pretty awesome, there is some nice description in places of sunsets, meteors, nightgowns - also a shout-out to librarians (smart stephen king, smart...) and i like it when authors name-drop themselves in their books. if stephen king were on goodreads.com he would be a total votewhore, say these two facts. the resolution is just awful. truly. i was hoping for something really cool, or at least plausible/comprehensible. it was like the happening in my epic disappointment, only this took longer than 2 hours to get through. ON MY VACATION! i am scattered right now - i will probably tidy up my thinking on this book later, but i wanted to get a start while it was mostly fresh in my head. it was overlong, and i hated the ending, but fun enough for me to not hate it overall. but i have no desire to reread it ever, the way i did with the stand, several times over. schooltime now! okay - school is over - i had one other thing to say I AM NOT FLOATING!! but here is the good librarian comment: \"who better to recruit than a librarian when you're dealing with a fledgling dictatorship?\" yes sir! but so this is about language, and i might be nitpicking a huge book's tiny problem, but while i love (and will in the future use) king's word \"joyshit\", it troubles me that he uses \"debark\" instead of \"disembark\", which is just more elegant and honestly, i have never heard the word \"debark\", and i thought he made it up. he hadn't. and also, he should know the difference between \"unbelievingly\" and \"disbelievingly\". just things that stuck out in my jerky mind that i felt would be exciting to share. was it? ...more UPDATE ON THE TV SERIES 8/14/2013: I gave up.

YET MORE INFO: The trade paper edition of this doorstopper is out. It's $19.99! Remember when that was a hardcover book's top price? My review is also at Expendable Mudge Muses Aloud . Rating: 4.25* of five The Book Report : Chester's Mills, Maine, is having itself an ordinary morning, and its citizens are gettin' up to all the usual things: Spending too much of their husband's money, killing girls, beating up people they don't like and driving them out of town, making evil brews, only thing missing really is a bonfire and a faggot. Business as usual for the human race, in other words. *WHAM* Down comes the Dome. No way in, no way out, no one can understand the nature, the origin, or the purpose of the Dome inside or outside of it. National security issues crop up. The town misfit, an Iraqi war vet, is called back into national service to solve the mystery. And then things get **really** ugly: The local used car salesman takes control. Think Nixon with a mean streak and a Big Fat Secret to protect. \"From Bad to Worse\" could be the subtitle of every Stephen King novel, but this time it's so so so so bad and then it gets so so so much worse that the reader is calling out to Divine Providence for the mercy of Death...and then comes The Twist. The Dome is revealed to be...but no, you have to read it. My Review : Stephen King = what Chuckles the Dick would've been if he'd had talent. Just sayin'. I hated liking this book. I resented the demands on my gouty wrists and fingers, supporting its mammoth weight, flipping the pages faster and faster and faster as I got more and more sucked in to the story. I snorted snobbily at myself, caught up in this not-terribly-sophisticated narrative. None of which stopped me finishing the book and sighing with mitigated contentment at its sudsy, gloriously cinematically trajectory. I can see the miniseries...I want to see the miniseries! soon please!...unfold in my mind. It's what Stephen King does brilliantly: Tells you a story of human nature, irrefutably making points that need making about Mankind and its flaws, while wringing your withers with fear, excitement, and sadness. The Dome was a really cool narrative device. I liked its unknowability, I was completely on board with mystery forces causing it who-knows-why...and then we find out why. I wasn't especially interested in that part, and felt it was a tidge unimaginitive coming from Mr. Shock-and-Awe himself. Eh...so what...I had over 1000pp of reading pleasure. It's like potato-chip sex. The kind you have because you can. It still feels good, and no way are you gonna stop just because it's meaningless. (I suppose this last isn't comprehensible to my girly readers of either gender.) Relax. Enjoy. Don't think too much. You'll end up in a much better mood than you started out in.

That has nothing to do with the negative comments I've heard about the aforementioned adaptation and everything to do with one simple fact: I don't need to see a filmed version. Because the mental version of the book is still unspooling in my mind. Sometimes you hear a lot of hype about a book, but the reading experience falls short. Sometimes, a book is about what you expected. There are occasionally those glorious occasions when the book exceeds the hype. For an example of this, check out Norman Partridge's sublime Dark Harvest, which I'd heard about for several years but never read until a couple months ago. That book knocked me on my tookus. And then there's Under the Dome. This novel catapulted my entire body into the air, propelled it through the window in a maelstrom of shattered glass, and sent it tumbling and broken into the lawn. Then, when I staggered to my feet, the darn book rose up from my bedroom floor, blasted through the window, and flattened me again. I've read more than fifty Stephen King books. Under the Dome is one of the top five. I've read plenty of criticisms about it. Too many points-of-view, unsubtle characterization, an anti-climactic ending. Personally, I loved it. Because I adore lists, here are just a few reasons why I consider Under the Dome a modern classic: 1. Big Jim Rennie: I love it when a villain takes over a story. The nastier the villain is, the greater the danger to the heroes and the more powerful potential catharsis there exists in defeating him. The Shark in Jaws. The warden in The Shawshank Redemption. Dolores Umbridge in the fifth Harry Potter book (seriously!). Big Jim Rennie is as vicious and calculating and eerily real as any villain in modern fiction. I absolutely despised him. But whenever he was on stage, I couldn't look away. 2. Baaaarbie: <---C>Dale Barbara</---C> was an unlikely protagonist, or at least he sure seemed that way. At first, I thought of him as a military Larry Underwood (if you're wondering about my favorite King book, it's still The Stand), but as the novel wore on, I realized how much I'd underestimated him---both his capacity for good and the depth of his sins. Plus, he had those three crucial traits: grit, wit, and It. 3. The Twists and the Straightaways: When I thought I knew who would live and who would die, I was often wrong. I never would've guessed what Andy Sanders would become. I had no idea I'd end up liking (or at least caring about) characters like the town drunk and the resident meth-maker. Sure, there were plot twists I saw coming; King never sacrifices plausibility for sheer shock value. But the things I did see coming fit beautifully into the framework of the tale, and King still found a way---via his technique, his timing, or even his word choice---to render those foreseen developments fresh. The intertextuality with his own works or the works of others---particularly William Golding's Lord of the Flies---was so deftly handled that the novel would have been diminished without it. I could write about this book for days, but I think an imperfect analogy might work best here. When Michael Jordan---the best player in basketball history---returned from retirement for the second time, it was with the Washington Wizards. Jordan had lost a step or three, and he no longer aired like he once did. But there was still magic in his shoes, and though his last team never did much, he certainly flashed moments of the old brilliance. But in one amazing game Jordan again surpassed the fifty-point mark, including an astonishing thirty-four-point first half. Watching Jordan out there performing his wizardry (sorry), it was obvious that all his accumulated knowledge and experience had been distilled into something transcendent. He pulled up for mid-range jumpers, he knocked down threes. He even threw down a thunderous dunk. Watching Jordan that night was like watching him in his prime, only it was somehow greater. He had defeated time. Or at least spun back the hands of the clock for one marvelous night. Reading Stephen King's Under the Dome was like watching Jordan work his magic that night. Only King's brilliance lasted for over a thousand pages (1348 pages on my Nook), and King never let up. Here was King scaring the hell out of me. Next was King breaking my heart by describing the death of a character I loved. King created a villain, and then another one even more monstrous, and then he threw me a bone by killing off a minor villain. Then he walloped me with some poetic setting descriptions before making me belly laugh at a shockingly crude joke. In other words, it was all there. The whole amazing repertoire. But that doesn't begin to describe this book. I said the Jordan comparison was imperfect, and it is. Woefully so. Because King never really retired the way Jordan did. King never had a game like the one Jordan had prior to the explosion alluded to above (Jordan only scored six in the game before the one I described; the worst games King ever played, Rose Madder and Insomnia, were still twenty-point/six-rebound/four-assist performances and far better than most writers could ever dream of mustering). And unlike Jordan was that night, King is not---in my opinion---immersed in the twilight of his career. No, I don't believe King's almost done. In fact, I believe, like the great Elmore Leonard, Stephen King is going to be producing amazing books for at least a couple more decades. I base this on the fact that he's a relentless self-improver, and if you don't believe that, compare his early stuff to Under the Dome. Sure, I love his early stuff. 'Salem's Lot, The Shining, The Dead Zone, and of course, The Stand are all among my favorite books by any writer. But putting Under the Dome next to the aforementioned titles shows that King has retained the pure storytelling magic that enthralled audiences back in the seventies, yet he hasn't ceased to grow. Looking at his recent writing, it's clear that his mastery of point-of-view, his eye for detail, his ability to orchestrate such a mindblowingly complex plot are even more impressive than they've ever been. These traits are the hallmarks of an individual who has never stopped learning, who has never gotten lazy. So yes, I loved Under the Dome. And I love Stephen King's work. I wrote a letter to him a few weeks ago, a letter I'll probably never send because I'm afraid he won't get it, and if he does, I'm afraid he'll think I'm either trying to ingratiate myself with him or worse, that I'm an obsessed fan. But friends, let me just say this. From the moment the dome came down until the very last word of that book....I was under that dread barrier too. I shuddered at the atrocities some of the characters committed. I fretted for the safety of my fellow townspeople. I came to fear Halloween and whatever else the premonitions foretold. But most of all, I hoped there would be a few good-hearted souls who would stand up for what was right. I stood with them under the dome. And if you haven't yet, I'd strongly encourage you to stand with them too. ...more I\u2019m not sure how to feel about Under the Dome .

But at the same time, King has really let me down with this cast of dull, one-dimensional, and highly stereotypical characters. It seems in this novel you are either a hateful, fear-mongering, murderous megalomaniac or you are a gentle, respectful, selfless individual with a limitless background of useful talents. There is little in between. In one case, a character is a blatant clone of the Trash Can Man from The Stand , complete with being the cause of a widespread disaster. Not very original. The interactions of these characters often seems forced and unnatural, and the dialogue, at times, horrendous. But still, the premise of the novel kept me going and the idea that one can be so completely isolated from functional society and the disasters which could result from this isolation became a truly terrifying prospect, especially as the story progressed. In the end, I would have to say that what I like about this novel outweighs the negative, especially with some touching scenes at the novel\u2019s conclusion where it becomes crushingly apparent how different a situation could be from one location to another, even if those locations are just inches apart. ...more Completely out of the blue a clear dome appears over the town of Chester\u2019s Mill, in Maine, of course.

I have been a fan since the beginning and have read the vast majority, although not all, of King\u2019s books. For me Under the Dome kicks it up a notch. Sure there is supernatural creepiness, and an explanation that is, well, disappointing. But this is Stephen King. Duh-uh. If you read the guy for his wonderful denouement explanations you probably shouldn't bother. What makes King so successful is that he writes great characters, draws you in and keeps you there once he has you, while scaring the bejesus out of you often enough to matter. He kept me under his dome for all 1072 pages. The addition to his usual toolkit this time is his expansion to the political. \u201cIf I'm going to spend a year writing a single draft of a book, it should be about something.\u201d ( http://media.barnesandnoble.com/index... ) Which of course begs a question about the value of spending, say half a year. What is the duration of labor at which one must cross over from pure entertainment to something ? I've always been a political novelist, and those things have always interested me. Firestarter is a political novel. The Dead Zone is a political novel. There's that scene in The Dead Zone where Johnny Smith sees Greg Stillson in the future starting a nuclear war. Around my house we kinda laugh when Sarah Palin comes on TV, and we say, \"That's Greg Stillson as a woman.\" ( http://www.salon.com/books/int/2008/1... ) More scary than funny to me. Well, maybe Dome is not so out of the way for King. But while political commentary has definitely found its way into King\u2019s books, there are few who consider him to be a political author. His other concerns usually take precedence. In Under the Dome he continues a lifelong fascination with small town life. Most of his people have significant secrets. And we get to see their character from how they cope with the stress they experience. The book took a long time to reach its final form. \u201cI started it in 1976, got about 75 pages into it \u2014 and then I saw what the scope of the thing was going to be, how many technological issues it raised, and I buckled. I\u2019m not a sci-fi writer; I don\u2019t know a lot about technology, so I thought I\u2019d try again, set it in an apartment building, and then I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with what the weather would be like under a dome. But I didn\u2019t like any of the characters, so I put it away.\u201d ( http://www.popmatters.com/pm/article/... ) He revisited the story in the 1980s. Renamed \u201cThe Cannibals\u201d it still had to do with people isolated in an apartment building. And still avoided having to cope with the technical demands of having the story set under a dome. The inspiration for the reduction in venue was a stay in a less than appealing area of suburban Pittsburgh during the filming of Creepshow . He wrote almost five hundred pages this time, but was still unable to figure out all that he needed to figure out. It was not until the new millennium that the manuscript turned up again. This time he was able to garner the expertise needed to get past his technical roadblocks. He returned to the dome notion and wrote up a storm. What would people do if stuck together, whether under a dome or in an apartment building? Perhaps a less tropical version of William Golding\u2019s classic, with adults gone wild instead of kids and without the beach. Let\u2019s just say that things do not go well, and dark forces, human ones, come to the fore. His boogey man this time is personified by that most iconic totem of dishonesty, a used-car salesman, named Big Jim Rennie. Big Jim may be the Second Selectman in the town of Chester\u2019s Mill, but he is the real power in town. First Selectman Andy Sanders is pretty much a smiling, charming non-entity, content to do whatever Big Jim wants. And the third Selectman is a drug-addicted woman who is reliant on Big Jim and Andy for her supplies. If you might think Big Jim is a stand-in for a certain vice president, you would be right. All the way to his questionable ticker. It might be a stretch to see in Rennie\u2019s son, Junior, a stand-in for Cheney\u2019s activist progeny, but maybe not. If you think Andy might be a stand-in for Dubya, right again, complete with an addiction issue. King sees Bush and Andy not so much as evil as weak, and the portrayal here reflects that. Rennie seemed pretty evil to me, complete with his insanely hypocritical refusal to use or tolerate profanity while behaving as profanely as possible, stealing critical supplies from the hospital, among other places, to support his meth lab, one of the largest in the country. He tells himself he is doing God\u2019s will. \u201cI enjoyed taking the Bush-Cheney dynamic and shrinking it to the small-town level,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last administration interested me because of the aura of fundamentalist religion that surrounded it and the rather amazing incompetency of those top two guys. I thought there was something blackly humorous in it. So in a sense, \u2018Under the Dome\u2019 is an apocalyptic version of \u2018The Peter Principle.\u2019 \u201d ( http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/boo... ) Expanding on his Cheney/Bush analogy, he goes through a list of items one can associate not only with that dynamic duo but with others throughout history who have used crisis as a way to consolidate power, fomenting discord by sponsoring provocative and secretive actions (think Reichstag fire) as a way to cast blame on enemies, raising a private army (whether in 1930s Germany or contemporary Blackwater, sorry, Xe), planning to massacre one\u2019s opponents (back to the funny moustache guy again), spying on one\u2019s own citizens (see Patriot Act), controlling or at least monitoring communications (ditto), attempting to destroy opposing media, and so on. No one actually says \u201cKill the Pig\u201d but if asked to, some would. It is certainly no coincidence that the evildoers here go after a truth-telling newspaper named The Democrat. There is also a countervailing force, the Jack of this scenario, although he has a name that sounds incongruous here. Dale Barbara, known as Barbie, is an ex-military wanderer, last employed at the local diner, someone who does all he can to avoid conflict, but like a certain Corleone, keeps getting dragged back. It is interesting that the hero here is a reluctant military guy and the baddies are both civilians and cops. Note also that the honest reporter is a Republican. Keeping a hand in with supernatural elements, some town residents, particularly children, have premonitions, visions of unpleasant events to come. Gee, do ya think they might? King keeps the action moving, and all the while gives us characters we can care about, warts and all. That is his greatest talent. Don\u2019t worry about the explanation for the dome. It is the reactions of the people contained within it that matter. The Dome itself could have come out of a mystical cracker jack box. While it might have been no fun for the residents of Chester\u2019s Mill to be stuck with each other for so long, it is no chore to keep an eye on them for all 1,072 pages, through a dome, darkly.

Obviously, my opinion matters little, since Stephen King is popular enough that he can write everything as long-winded as he'd like and tell us all to move along if we aren't happy with it. This was a disturbing, gory, graphic and engrossing read. The cast of characters varied from sane to insane, which made for a lot of booing and cheering when it came to following everyone's individual stories. Quick Story Synopsis : One small town is minding their own small-town business when from out of nowhere, a dome closes over their town, shutting them off from the rest of the world. They can see the world, but can't get to it. What caused this dome to appear? Nobody knows and answers aren't so quick to be found. Can you imagine what people would do in such a situation? What if supplies ran out? What if law and order suddenly ceased to exist? If you can think of all the horrific things which could happen, chances are many of those exact things are happening in this book. Ever heard of the term \"shit hits the fan?\" Yep. You guessed it. I can't really review this book further without giving away big plot reveals. In a nutshell, I'll go back to what I said above : there was a story worth reading, but I don't know if I'll ever fully embrace King's style of over-descriptive writing. If there's a hair growing out of a mole on a person's face, chances are, we'll hear about it. Also, I always feel like there's some soap-box opinions being brought to us through the writing. I prefer not to have to read about politics and religion in books when it becomes sort of nit-picky. That's just my personal preference. Do I think this is going to make for an interesting t.v. show? Probably. At least I think there's room for a lot of crazy potential, although some scenes might have to be downgraded in content to meet mainstream t.v. requirements. I'll be watching it even if it's horrible though because of Mike Vogel, who is playing my favorite character Barbie from the book. Shallow? Probably.

There are no monsters or creepers (well not really) but I think the villians in this story are much more terrifying because of the recent outbreak of fear-mongering in America. Whats the only thing more terrifying that monsters...Republicans. Just kidding...well not really...but sorta. Its funny that I tend to lean more conservative. I believe in the right to bare arms, capital punishment and small government but if I had to be trapped under a dome with a group of people I hope and pray its liberals. King has crafted himself a gang of the most terrifying villians yet and its because they are actual people. No special powers just regular murderous money grubbing people. I bet I know people who would reduce themselves to the acts of Big Jim if pushed to far. Maybe I'm one of those people. And as usual I am impressed with Kings character development. While not nearly as good as Duma Key or Misery (whose cast of characters were much smaller) I thought King put a lot of thought and care into these characters because in the end there were people that I absolutely hated and people that I absolutely loved. To me character development is the most important component to any story. Bravo King! But really what struck me the most is how fast a civilized group of people can turn into a lynching mob under the right leadership. In the story these people were lied to and very few of them stopped to use common sense or ask questions. How very similiar to recent events. 'Well he's the guy in charge so he must be right'. I'm not sure if King ment for this story to make a political statement but thats how I saw it and it really spoke to me. ...more The only thing more preposterous than the premise of this book is how the characters responded to it.

Meanwhile, a small collection of like-minded good guys start to strangely gather one to another and begin bonding around their outlandish good nature and intuitive good sense, an intuition shared only by this select few who gather together occasionally to collect all their facts and come to stunningly accurate conclusions through dialogues that read like the minutes of a high school student government meeting. My good man, Stephen King needs an editor who can snap him into shape. I don't mean to necessarily make a book like this shorter, I mean to make it better. King can handle a large ensemble of characters and a complex plot. He can even write well enough to keep me reading a huge book that I find stupid. I just ask that he be required to not simplify his characters just to drive a ridiculous plot to a rip-roaring ending. ...more Trigger warning for Rape, Abuse, Violence and Pure Gore \u2022 MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES - Check \u2022 Original Scary Concept - Check \u2022 F#$% Psychos - Check \u2022 Stephen King\u2019s writing - Check \u201cIf you can't laugh when things go bad--laugh and put on a little carnival--then you're either dead or wishing you were.\u201d I DID IT!!!

It was everything I wanted in a book and more. You have to agree when Stephen King writes a big book it\u2019s usually mind-blowingly amazing and with Under the Dome I got nothing less but pure perfection in story-telling. If you have read The Stand you will absolutely devour this one. The Story essentially follows the lives of people in Chester\u2019s Mill, from out of nowhere a transparent and impenetrable Dome appears, with that we see how being literally caught in a rock and a hard place might change some people and the story kicks off from there\u2026 First of all the HUGE cast of people was my favorite part, different personalities and a vast a ray of faces made the story appear so real, that you question whether this disaster is actually happening. King managed to immerse me into the dome and feel for these characters and also how he managed to capture voices of dogs, woodchucks, birds and other animals as the phenomena was happening was genius. He single handedly managed to balance out plot-development and characterization, which made the book personal and fast for the reader. The Writing-style was fun and easy to get into, with a sense of dark humor and really short chapter which made the pacing of the book move really quickly. If you are those people who are affected by death of characters and pets, 50 people die in the first 50 pages YES! King went there. I was like... I rooted for the awesome good guys and I HATED like 50 people, my wanting for revenge and retribution made flip the pages. I personally HATED Big Jim (if you\u2019ve read the book you understand) I wanted to jump in the pages and shoot his ass. It touched upon topics of Power, Rape and Abuse, Morality, Religion, Death, Politics and so much more. I was surprised by how fast I went through it and people are intimidated by the size but sparing some time and immersing yourself in the story, you will not regret, especially if you are familiar with kings writing. I loved loved loved this book and it might on of the best book I have ever read. UPDATE: I Just saw the series adaptation... AND IT WAS SHIT!!!

All the locals are either apathetic or complete morons (because anyone with any intelligence wouldn't live in a small town unless deep down they're evil). The plot was basically \"what happens when a big fish in a small town has the opportunity to take complete power.\" I thought this would be a great psychological thriller. People trapped under a mysterious dome has so many possibilities. Instead it became mired down in a power grab. A lot disappointed me with this book, but I think the biggest disappointment was the fact that the big bad guy just dies. I really wanted him face justice in the real world. I wanted to see his face as the federal government took him away. I feel robbed that I didn't get that. The ending was another disappointment. It just ended. No big finale. Just make the monster that put the dome in place understand that it is hurting real beings. Then there was a sloppy moral where the characters learned to appreciate life. Ahhh, happy ending. Not satisfying but happy for them. ...more Whew! I finally finished it! It took me almost 2 weeks. That is the longest it has ever taken for me to read a book.

I think every book-lover should at least read one book by Stephen King in their life. I've read a lot of Stephen King. I was a big fan when I was in my teenage years. The Stand and The Long Walk are among his best. Under The Dome is sadly one of his worst. It was a book which started as an idea for a project called \"The Cannibals\" in 1976. He never finished it. I was kind of disappointed, there are no cannibals in Under The Dome. The book is colossal at more than 1000 pages. This isn't anything new for King fans as many of his books are more than 700 pages. It was over 1000 pages I've read a lot of Stephen King. I was a big fan when I was in my teenage years. The Stand and The Long Walk are among his best. Under The Dome is sadly one of his worst.

The book is colossal at more than 1000 pages. This isn't anything new for King fans as many of his books are more than 700 pages. It was over 1000 pages and was one of King's better books (although the ending was disappointing). Under The Dome should not have been 1000 pages. It should have been maybe 300 pages tops. The story meanders and meanders and nothing really happens of interest. The characters are completely dull, lifeless, one dimensional. They're created with a stroke of the pen and quickly start dying off. I never cared for them so it really wasn't a big deal when they died. The plot is another King rehash. A combination of much of his weaker work with a dash of The Stand here and there. It's part Tommyknockers (his worst book IMO), partly Dreamcatcher (also awful) and partly Needful Things (mediocre at best). The book is also an anti-bush polemic. I'm not a Bush fan but this is a little late as far as anti-Bush messages go and very thinly veiled. The main bad guys in the book are two town politicians based on George W Bush (dumb, incompetent) and Dick Cheney (power hungry, ruthless, corrupt). It's so obvious and cloying that I didn't hate these characters or feel sympathy for them. Instead of creating real characters King has just taken Bush and Cheney and inserted them in his story. Perhaps if King had any tact for writing political allegories this would have been a better novel. Under the Dome is partly based on Lord of the Flies which King frequently mentions in his work. 'Flies' was a much better novel than this, suspenseful and gripping and no more than 200 pages. Under The Dome is 5 times as long and 5 times as bad. I felt like I've seen this situations and characters before. King has just changed a few minor details. The dome itself is just a setup for another town which drives itself crazy. It's Needful Things, Cell, The Stand, Dreamcatcher and The Tommyknockers all over again. A few elements have been changed but the plot is basically the same. King can be a good writer at times but he can also be a god awful writer. In this case he's god awful. This wasn't particularly original. The idea is largely ripped off from an old Twilight Zone clone. The resolution is also utterly cheesy and practically an afterthought. It's Deus Ex Machina at its worst. Of course this is a tactic frequently employed by King when he doesn't know how to write a conclusion. ...more What a depressing book.

Much like Brian Keene \u2019s Darkness on the Edge of Town , this is a novel of what could conceivably happen to a tight-knit community (read: where people know too much of each other\u2019s business ) when they are cut off from the outside world. To say that things get ugly is an understatement. Murder, rape, exploitation, madness\u2026 well, that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. However, this novel does not deal with events in the same first person intimacy as Keene\u2019s book. Rather, events play out on a bigger scale. \u201dIt\u2019s Halloween. It\u2019s the Great Pumpkin\u2019s fault! You have to stop the Great Pumpkin!\u201d The paranormal angle, even though being central to the story, is somewhat downplayed for the most part.

Because on the one hand, calling a particular book Stephen King's best is kind of like saying that Genghis Khan was the most humane mass-murderer in history (you know, as in, \"Who gives a sh-t when they're all so terrible to begin with?\"); but then again, I was an avowed King fan for many years myself, and like many I have long held onto the hope that he might go from merely entertaining to truly brilliant late in his career, just exactly like Mark Twain did, and so it's hard not to be intrigued when a growing amount of people start calling his newest the exact brilliant breakthrough I had been hoping for. So I broke down and checked out the three-pound behemoth (seriously, that's its actual weight) from my neighborhood library last month, and slogged through 75 pages of it every night for two weeks straight until I was finally finished. And what did I think? Well, in a nutshell -- meh . Because yes, this might possibly be one of the best books of King's career; but as I was painfully reminded of starting about halfway through, that's still not saying an awful lot, and is why King is destined to eventually become the modern equivalent of the Victorian Age's Edward Bulwer-Lytton, yet another massively popular author who sold tens of millions of books when alive, but who just a hundred years later is now barely remembered. And that's because King is a master at turning in flashy reflections of our particular day and age, books that are exactly as entertaining when first reading as some generic television show playing in the background of your kitchen when trying to make dinner one night, but that largely fail the test of time just as badly as an episode of Law & Order after its fourth viewing; and although I have no doubt that a century from now, there will still be a healthy audience reading his absolutely most well-known work like The Stand and the \"Dark Tower\" series, the vast majority of his oeuvre is destined to be known the same way we currently know the vast majority of books by, say, Jules Verne or Jack London, as simply an endless list of unlinked, forgotten titles at the bottom of his Wikipedia entry. Although make no mistake, Under the Dome has a great high-concept premise, one that's easy to describe but that can fuel a thousand-page manuscript; basically, one day an impenetrable force-field bubble appears around a small town in Maine, over 30,000 feet high and presumably that far deep under the surface too, blocking out everything but a trickle of water and air and utterly unbreakable by any device known to man. So who constructed it? And why? And how long will it last? Well, although King does eventually give a lip-service answer to those questions by the end (for an interesting reason that he details during his recent surprisingly fascinating talk for the New York Times' \"TimesCenter\" podcast), these aren't really the questions he's most interested in exploring; no, what he's most interested in discussing is what would happen to existing society under such circumstances, under a situation where both basic resources and all authority figures have been stripped away from a modern American civilization, making this King's less-heavy version of such recent high-minded apocalyptic tales as Cormac McCarthy's The Road . And like The Road , King frames his answer mostly through the filter of what we saw happen to our society during the Bush years of the early 2000s, when we first got a little taste of what such an apocalypse might be like; and like The Road , King's conclusion is that we'd all be pretty much screwed*, that the sheen of \"enlightened civility\" we pride ourselves on here in the US is in actuality just the thinnest of veneers, and that all it would take is just a few chinks in this armor to turn all of us into snarling, violent, genocidal animals. After all, this is exactly what we saw so many citizens of New Orleans turn into, after the Bush administration decided to abandon the city after Hurricane Katrina, what exactly we saw so many American soldiers turn into once getting the official permission of the Bushists to torture and rape without repercussions; and in this you can add Under the Dome to such other '00s classics as The Road , The Plot Against America , Jamestown , Anathem , The Possibility of an Island , Radiant Days , Rant , The Yiddish Policemen's Union and World War Z to equal by the end an entire class of so-called \"Bushist Literature,\" the disaster-plagued chaos-embracing stories that will teach future generations about the unending misery we all just got done living through (and will soon be living through again, apparently, if the teabaggers have their way, proving again just like the Germans did in the 1900s that sometimes it takes not just one but two giant catastrophies before a fascist society finally learns its f-cking lesson). And in fact King does a nice job here of exploring the details of the Bush years through the microcosm of a small New England town, with various characters in this massive cast standing in for such infamous figures as Bush himself and his evil puppetmaster Dick Cheney, as well as a look at how such glibly religious, self-righteous monsters can so easily manipulate an entire population into mass panic and resulting mob violence, therefore justifying the martial law they wanted all along. But then this starts getting into the problems I had with this book as well, which is that King felt the need here to push all these stereotypes to the Nth most radical degree: just to cite one good example, the Glenn-Beck-listening city council members who take over in the wake of the dome's appearance are not just corrupt and lazy, but also just happen to be meth dealers; and are not just meth dealers but happen to be the largest meth dealers in the entire United States ; and are not just the largest meth dealers in the entire United States but priest-killing necrophiliacs that also just happen to be the largest meth dealers in the entire United States, and who by the way happen to be the corrupt city council members who organize a brownshirt-style takeover of the town's armory after the appearance of the dome. Subtle, King, subtle! And that's disappointing, because this weakens the entire message that most of these Bushist books (including King's) are trying to make -- that true evil in a corrupt society comes not from the tiny amount of legitimately freakish monsters, but rather the petty evils of a million otherwise decent human beings, that the troubles of the Bush years weren't caused by priest-killing necrophiliacs but rather by a hundred thousand cops and security guards and airport security screeners, each and every one of whom added an extra 30 seconds of misery to the lives of every person they professionally dealt with, simply as a way of meting petty scorn on a series of innocent victims who had no means of retaliating or even complaining. As we all unfortunately learned last decade, this is more than enough horror to create a 24-hour national waking nightmare, and it's a shame that King felt the need to gussy this up into the ludicrous extremes seen in Under the Dome . Now combine all this with what's turned out over the decades to be King's natural recurring problems simply as a writer, weaknesses in his work that have been there since the very first day -- stilted dialogue, for example, an eyerolling amount of casual misogyny, annoying villainous catchphrases that are then repeated so often that you eventually want to beat the author to death with his own freaking three-pound book -- and you can suddenly see why a person might consider this one of King's best books but still be disappointed by it anyway. But then to flip the argument once again, I was tempted to forgive King many times for these exact things I'm complaining about -- because after all, most of the exaggerations of evil seen here are in reality no worse than the actual cartoonish evil that the Bushists really did get away with during the '00s; or to cite another example, if King hadn't made this so big and rambling, people wouldn't be talking so much about it in the first place, making its excessive size both necessary and unnecessary at the same time. So when all is said and done, then, I found myself with a whole plethora of emotions when it comes to Under the Dome -- gratitude that King was so willing to stand up to his conservative fans like this, amazement that the mouth-breathers have so passionately fallen for it anyway, yet disappointment that it wasn't better than it was, and a sort of tired resignation over the fact that all a Stephen King book has to be is merely okay for it to get labeled The Greatest Stephen King Book Of His Entire Career. It comes absolutely recommended to existing King fans, but with only a lukewarm endorsement for those who aren't, a book that I'm very glad exists but that I don't think is necessarily worth everyone's time. It should all be kept in mind before picking it up yourself. Out of 10: 7.5 *And by the way, a final observation about this book that I found no good place for in the main review: that the last hundred pages now stand as the single greatest piece of disaster pornography in the history of the genre , a boner-inducing catastrof-ck that alone almost completely justifies the 900 so-so pages that come before it. It's true what this book's most diehard fans say, that you shouldn't judge Under the Dome until you've gotten to the very last page, and that you shouldn't assume you know what the ending will be just because you're getting a good sense of it two-thirds of the way through. ...more Prva misao: posle 780 stranica zaslu\u017eili smo malkoooo ubedljiviju zavr\u0161nicu.

And this is what makes King my favorite author (well, the main thing, anyway), when he writes a fast-paced novel, I don't dare look away. Not only is it fast-paced, but King brings the characters and their community to life so convincingly that I'm afraid of what could be happening with my back turned, and I don't want to miss anything. It's more like watching than reading, and every time I closed the book, even for just a second, I would wonder what was happening that I wasn't there to observe. If this is what it means to give a book life, then King is like Dr. Frankenstein, only he knows exactly what he is doing and is more than willing to shape and guide and love these newly formed creations of his. Under The Dome is like a return to an older, more ruthless version of King. I would not have been one bit surprised if this book had been published as \"the last (and we really, really mean it this time guys... maybe) posthumous Richard Bachman novel\". It reminds me of some of his older books, with little hints of The Tommyknockers, Dreamcatcher, IT, The Stand, and The Dead Zone, and then had minute references to the Dark Tower series and The Talisman. There is so damn much packed into this book that I know I can't talk about it all without writing a review that's almost as long as the book itself. Big Jim Rennie, your typical used-car salesman turned power-hungry politician, reminded me of Greg Stillson, only more Caligula-esque. He's narcissistic, and thinks that the world, or maybe at least the town, revolves around him and should kiss his feet in an offering of thanks for managing their pitiful little lives for them. He's selfish and cruel and greedy and manipulative. Let's just say that he takes full advantage of the Dome to achieve his personal agenda. He pulls the strings behind the scenes that set in motion a series of events that aren't exactly pretty. He increases the size of the police force exponentially, making sure that the new recruits are all young, hot-blooded and authority-wielding men, creates a state of fear and panic, and effectively turns the town into a police-state. There are a lot of references to Hitler, but I likened it quite a lot to the Patriot Act Mentality of the most recent Bush administration: You're either with US, or with THEM. It shows, at least on the reactionary side, what can happen when we lose ourselves to fear and want someone else to take care of us and make everything all better. There is also a strong environmental warning here. Be careful what you manufacture, because you may just be forced to live with it and pay the price for it now, and not in some indefinite and indefinable future generation. The characters in this book were of course brilliant, as I think all of King's characters are. They are fully realized and alive, and at any moment feel like they could walk off the page and into existence. I loved Barbie (Dale Barbara), Rusty, Twitch, Julia, Joe, Norrie, Benny, Linda and the kids... I loved the way that they acted the way that REAL people act, and not the way that over-the-top book characters act. I loved that they were who they were to the end, and rolled with the times, but didn't let the times change them. I could say a lot more, but I think I'll leave it at that. I loved this book, as I fully expected to. It was definitely a roller-coaster, and even though I was afraid of what the next brutal, cringe-inducing page would bring, I couldn't have stopped reading if you'd paid me. This is why King is my favorite author. ...more Before we begin, I thought I would point out something silly. Lee Child wrote the blurb that graces the trade paperback edition of Under the Dome , one that states: \"Seven words: The best yet from the best ever.\" Not only is Lee Child full of shit (no true King fan will call this novel his best work, not even close) but Child's literary creation Jack Reacher is mentioned half a dozen times within King's novel. That's a lot for a character that doesn't even belong to King. But that's the business. Before we begin, I thought I would point out something silly. Lee Child wrote the blurb that graces the trade paperback edition of Under the Dome , one that states: \"Seven words: The best yet from the best ever.\" Not only is Lee Child full of shit (no true King fan will call this novel his best work, not even close) but Child's literary creation Jack Reacher is mentioned half a dozen times within King's novel. That's a lot for a character that doesn't even belong to King. But that's the business. You whack me off, I whack you off, and we all profit from the clean up. Is it any wonder why author blurbs equate to a puddle of warmed over spunk to most readers? And those who still believe these front cover grabbers are usually upset by the end of the book. Don't believe me? Go read the reviews of Scott Smith's The Ruins or Nick Cutter's The Troop and count how many times you read something to the effect of \"I only read this because of Uncle Stevie's blurb on the front of the book. Is King doing drugs again, because this sucks!\" Which begs the question: Do blurbs actually sell books? Better yet, would an honest blurb sell a book? How about this: \" Under the Dome is a rollercoaster ride, but when it stops, the ride operator farts in your mouth.\" Yeah... that probably wouldn't sell many books. But goddamn if it isn't the truest blurb I can think of for this book. I first read Under the Dome when it came out in 2009. I wore out both my wrists trying to read the hardcover. I liked it all the way up until the ending. Not because it's a cop out or too clean or any of the other complaints I heard, but because I knew it was coming. It happens in just about every King novel. (view spoiler) [Hero has psychic link with villain/monster and is able to save the day. (hide spoiler) ] But it works for King, and besides, I have a theory for why that happens. Is my theory a sorry attempt at me trying to explain my biggest literary hero's oft-used crutch? Probably. But it makes sense, so fugoff! (I'll explain my theory in the spoiler section toward the end of this review.) While I have pretty much summed up Under the Dome in the blurb located at the end of the first paragraph of this review, I do feel the need to express how awesome the first 1020 pages of this book are. If you are a King fan, you'll likely have fun. There's very little filler. Anyone who would like to argue that this novel is bloated, I will throw down with you in the comment section, because everything in this book serves a purpose. Every chapter progresses the story. The problem/blessing is that there is so much story. But if one chapter had been cut, this pile of Lincoln Logs would most definitely tumble. It does not feel as large as King's other 1000-page efforts, though. The Stand and IT are both massive in their own right, but they seem bigger in scope as well. Grander. This one is more The Tommyknockers kinda big. More Needful Things . It's also better than the former and nowhere near as good as the latter. Everything happens over a short period of time, but the events do escalate. The inhabitants of Chester's Mill are fucked by the end, albeit not quite as fucked as I would have hoped they would be. If King is to be believed, and I think he is, he first started writing this book in the 70s. Some people believe that King says this to keep Under the Dome from being compared to The Simpson's Movie . The only reason I believe King is because I started a novel back in the late nineties called Dark Side of the Mountain , wherein people get trapped inside a huge black sphere somewhere in the San Bernardino Mountains in California. People trapped by unseen/unknown forces... Yeah, the idea is not all that original. Anyfuck, King's original title for Under the Dome was The Cannibals . I like the idea of that title. I like where King wanted to take us. People stuck under a freaky-ass dome. Food supplies start to deteriorate. People find other food sources... Rad. What we get instead is a pedal-to-the-medal horror/sci fi/thriller stuffed inside the confines of King's typical small Maine town. My biggest complaint is that all this feels like I've been here before. The Chef feels like Trashcan Man. Barbie feels like Jim Gardner. You have your witty old woman. Your racist/religious/power hungry villain. Your sick-and-dying baddie. Precocious children. And so on. This is a Stephen King novel. You either like that shit or you don't. He's done it better. He's done it much, much, muchmuchmuch worse. All in all, this is just an average effort from an above average novelist who only writes a decent ending every five years or so. But if you're a Stephen King fan, you know, \"It's about the journey, not the destinations.\" At least that's what King tells us. Audiobook notes: Ra\u00fal Esparza is fantastic. This is one of the best King audiobooks for sale right now. It made my reread so much easier. Television series notes: Fuck the television series. That series is garbage. Not garbage in the sense that it doesn't follow the book (however, that is true), but garbage because it's garbage. It's poorly acted and shittily written. Before clicking on this next spoiler tag, you must know that I will be spoiling far more than just this book. These are theories on how all of King's novels tie together. Expect spoilers from his entire catalog. You've been warned. (view spoiler) [Consipracy Theory: I believe the Grays ( The Tommyknockers ), Pennywise ( IT ), the butt weasels Dreamcatcher , and the leatherfaces ( Under the Dome ) are all the same alien race and that they all originated in the Prim (consult the Stephen King wiki for what that is: http://darktower.wikia.com/wiki/Prim .) These are the creatures that gave humankind the knowledge that allowed us to become as technologically advanced as we've become. In the Dark Tower novels they are called the Old Ones. Why does everyone in King's novels have psychic powers? Because of the ship in The Tommyknockers . In that novel, there's an alien spacecraft buried in the woods outside of Haven, Maine. That ship gives people psychic abilities and knowledge of advanced technology. Because there's no way of telling when the craft landed there's not way of telling how many people it \"polluted\" before Bobbi Anderson dug it up. This explains Carrie and every other pop-up psychic in the King-verse. Those psychics living outside the pollution area of Maine are children or relatives of people who've lived in Maine at some time or the other. Example: Danny Torrance and Doc Hallorann.

In summation: Despite the three-star rating, I say skip this one. If you want a great King epic, try The Stand . If you want a great story about a small town tearing itself apart, try Needful Things . There are just so many better King novels out there. If you wanna know where to start, I'll be in the comment section answering questions. Final Judgment: Dead fuck. ...more Many things can be said about Under The dome , but tedious is not one of them.

However, that was not to be without sacrifice. King is well known for his famous characters, always well drawn and memorable - even non-readers know about Carrie and Jack Torrance. Those who read the works will undoubtedly remember heroes and villains from many tomes that span King's ouevre: Stu Redman, Bill Denbrough, Randal Flagg, Annie Wilkes and Dolores Clairborne... Not so with The Dome . The characters are cartoonish at best. Dale Barbara, aka \"Barbie\", the main \"hero\", seems more like an idea of a Vietnam veteran than an actual human being. He is a hero, though he has a backstory that's less than heroic, but that's pretty much it. The meat's there, but when you bite into it you realize that it's mostly stale. Big Jim Reenie is King's most uninteresting villain ever. He literally needs a white suit and a cane to fit into an average comic book. The ultimate stereotype, overweight, hypcritical uber-Christian, who also happens to be a drug dealing psychopath for no apparent reason. And we're talking about the largest drug factory not only in the small town of Chester Mill, but in the USA. Big Jim seems to produce drugs and wreak havoc for no particular reason other than being a plot device. The novel features a large cast of characters, but none of them are particularly memorable. Frankly, the whole town seems to be composed of people who are, uh, incompetent, even moronic. Only one kid who uses his grandfather's oxygen mask does something intelligent. The rest of people are tools, who give Jim Reenie a standing ovation when he gives them a crazy speech just after he turned the town into a police state. I also find it hard to believe that only one policeman would know about Reenie's illegal affairs. Aren't small town supposed to be gossip mills? Can only criminally inclined kids serve as policemen? And who would follow Jim Reenie with all his religious blabber for 5 minutes in real life? Actions undertook by citizens are just awesomely stupid when you think about them a bit. The oxygen passes through the dome, but at a much slower rate - yet everyone drives around in their cars and contributes to the polution! Dale Barbara, the reclusive Vietnam vet, was planning to leave town at the beginning of the novel. But he left one detail behind him, a detail that would contribute to his subsequent incrimination. His DOG TAGS. I can understand clothing, even his wallet with personal documents, but dog tags? I can't imagine a soldier who would forget his dog tags - even if he wanted to part with his past he just wouldn't leave them in his socks! The biggest problem comes when one woman discovers a protected file in her husband'study - her husband was a policeman who was investigating Jim Reenie, and compiled a file that could lead to his demise. Now, what would a sensible person do with such a file? Send it to everyone? Make multiple copies? Distribute it as broadly as possible? Is this what happens? NO. Also, where is the American spirit? People under the Dome either jump onto the bully bandwagon, or blindly and stupidly take blows from these bullies. They are even scared that the bullies will order them to give back their guns. Their guns! Not one person (including the protagonists) stands up and says \"people, these in charge are mad. It can't go on any longer because they're kill us all. We have to think and do something about the problem. If it'll come to this, we'll have to fight them\". No one even thinks like that under the Dome. Frankly, the book redeems itself a bit with the ending. The mystery of the Dome kept me going on and wanting to see what will happen, and unlike many readers I found the conclusion to be satisfying and even thought-provoking. If only the rest of the book was like that... There are passages in Uner The Dome that stand out above all rest.The airplane and the woodchuck. People observing the distorted sunset and the fall of pink stars. The frenetic ending sequences, with people gasping for air and a lone hand appearing on the dirty surface. But none of that matches the children of IT battling the bullies in The Apocalyptic Rockfight, Danny Torrance playing in the children's playground of Hotel Overlook, or his father looking back at the topiary animals. There is not a single moment of tension that would match Stu Redman's escape from the plague center or the children discovering the origins of IT. Under The Dome had the potential to be a great epic about isolation, a community crumbling under extreme conditions, the scarcity of resource and people dealing with the pressure and infinite darkness of their own nature. Granted, there's plenty of darkness in the story. But none of it is convincing, let alone threatening (except maybe for the resolution). Unfortunately, too much of that went away to keep the pedal to the metal. King's other works dealing with these subjects are much more memorable and interesting - family enduring confinement in The Shining and people living after the plague in The Stand come to mind. Under The Dome is recommended to fans of the author. People new to his work will do better checking out his earlier, and better, titles. ...more Muy buen libro de King.

Yes, there is a giant dome that has covered an entire town, but where did it come from? Is it alien or is it demonic? With King you are never sure and because this book was over 1000 pages long, I almost feel as if I should also put it on my 'Mystery' shelf. There are a ton of reviews on this one and I have friends who loved it and some who... well, not so much. In my opinion, it was just above average. This novel reminded me of 'Needful Things' in that, it involved a ton of characters and an entire town. But with Needful Things, which I loved, the story was a supernatural one, so the plot and the actions of the characters worked for me. The Dome is the opposite; it is a Sci-Fi tale with nothing supernatural at all involved. and for that reason, the characters actions did not work for me. The bad guys were all a little over the top and I just couldn't take seriously the state of affairs going on in the town. If King would have taken out the ultra evil Town selectman, his brain damaged son, and the mad scientist meth-head Chef, and instead presented the plot with realistic people and affairs, I think this would have been a very interesting piece. And the reason it would have been interesting (and this is the thing I did like about the book) is because King tackled the lifelong, worldwide, debate and discussion that we have probably all had at one time or another. The comparison of us and them with the example of children looking down on an anthill. It really is a deep and somewhat scary subject and one that can be batted around in endless directions. The other thumbs up I give to the story is that, even though it is over a 1000 pages, the book is almost non-stop action from beginning to end. Regardless how you may feel about the story if you read it, one thing is certain; you will not be bored. ...more \u201cIf you can't laugh when things go bad - laugh and put on a little carnival - then you're either dead or wishing you were.\u201d This book is the largest novel I\u2019ve ever read.

This made the ending even more blazing. The last chapters were some of the most terrifying amount of events I've had the pleasure of reading. Well played,Mr.King! You gave me nightmare fuel for an entire month! The (view spoiler) [breaking the fourth wall (hide spoiler) ] piece of narration was brilliant. I love self-aware narrators.

I was reading this sort of stuff at sixteen, too, but she said that she'd really enjoyed Twilight and so I'm not sure whether she's ready for the King. Oops. Anyway: this is the story all about how a whole town's life got flipped, turned upside down when a massive invisible (but no less tough for that) dome appears out of nowhere along the town's exact borders. And the book is incredible. All the gushing blurbs on the back talk about how it never drops its pace and I agree: it doesn't. It's fast and it's strong and I never wanted to put it down. I personally think that this book is the best book he's written in recent years (although I also really enjoyed Black House; when did he write that?) but it's really interesting to me how many people here hated it, especially in the comments. It's a monster of a book and I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone but if you love Stephen King and already know you have a head (and a stomach) for his epically destructive, gory and heart-wrenching masterpieces, then go right ahead. I want you to read this and I want you to feel how I did: that even though it was 1100 pages, I could have kept reading. P.S. I've just finished this for the second time.

Review: This book is responsible for something which didn't happen to me in a long time: I was so invested in this story I actually wanted to throw this book at the wall sometimes and even tried to cry at Stephen King to finally let this character die. My reactions were mainly due to the definite division of the cast of characters into black and white ones; \"Under the Dome\" included nearly no grey characters, but did rather make them either rapists, villains, rowdies and murderers or innocents, likeable, 'normal' people. I love the potential King raises by the initial situation at the very beginning of the novel - the Dome was used to tie different characters to one another, to narrate tragic fates, to weave exciting and thrilling storylines. Neither the beginning nor the ending were especially investing; it was the middle section, the characters' reactions and their behaviors which were so interesting to me as a reader. To be honest, I didn't like the ending very much, but I will delve deeper into this in the part which I marked as a spoiler. My major complaint is how King decided to draw his characters. While some of them like Barbie, Julia, Joe and Rusty were always likeable and in general characters to root for, others like Big Jim, Carter and Junior represented the evil part of the city, and there was no one in-between them. Nearly every other supporting character was either stupid, alcohol-addicted or meth-addicted, and the ones who weren't murderers were characterized as fools. Yet, King established a very wide-colored cast in this novel, and I enjoyed reading about every single one of them. (Well, to be honest, I always caught myself eyerolling when having to read about Andy Sanders, and I always jubilated inwardly as soon as Linda Everett and Brenda Perkins came into action.) For a detailed opinion on the characters and the plot, click the spoiler (which you should only open if you've read the book, since it will spoil nearly everything which could be spoiled about the ending): (view spoiler) [So, the ending was in my opinion a huge disappointment, just as it probably was for many other readers. The identity of the ones who were responsible was pretty much left open to be interpretated, and the actual event itself felt underwhelming and anticlimatic. But most importantly, I would have liked to read more about the characters' reactions to the disappearance of the Dome; what would they be going to do, would they want to rebuild Chester's Mill, would they fear another Dome, how would they mourn their killed neighbours? I've read a suggestion about aliens having built the Dome in order to protect this city from a forthcoming huge natural disaster, an idea I like a lot and would have loved to see being played out. In contrast to many others, however, I didn't particularly mind the way Big Jim was killed. A fight with Barbie or Rusty in the very end would have been too obvious, but I agree that a little confrontation with Colonel Cox might have added some nice aspects to the story. It was suspenseful to see which character was going to die and which would belong to the ones who survived in the very end. At some point in the middle of the book, I started to guess who would die during the course of the story, and I'm proud to say I guessed nearly everyone right. I didn't expect the deaths of Carolyn Surges, Benny Drake and Aidan Appleton, however, and on the other hand, I would have thought Rose Twitchell and Rusty Everett were going to die. The fact that Ollie survived after his parents committed suicide and his brother was killed in an accident was enthralling; I really warmed up to his character during the last scenes. Speaking about the Everetts, it was nice to read about a normal family with two kids and a dog, and I'm glad every one of them (apart from the dog) survived the Dome, mostly because Linda became one of my favorite characters - the scene where she had to deal with Carter was one of my favorite ones. Meanwhile, Junior quickly became a fascinating character, whose fate I was very interested in, but I would have liked a little more complexity in his downfall. His character was very early on reduced to Junior not being himself anymore. King did not only write some really repelling parts (a rape scene should be mentioned here; it unfortunately didn't add anything to the story and did not even see the victim dealing with the consequences), but he also angered me as a reader with the population of Chester's Mill being absolutely stupid and uninspired. The way everyone followed Big Jim reminded me a lot of Animal Farm , a comparison Lennongirl has already mentioned in her review . A secondary observation: Stephen King used an interesting device to build up the atmosphere; every chapter was longer than the previous one in the course of the book [Ch. 1: 4 pages; Ch. 5: 20 pages; Ch. 10: 45 pages; Ch. 15: 59 pages; Ch. 20: 84 pages] before they became shorter again as the ending became closer (Ch. 25: 59 pages). I hope nobody else has already mentioned it because I was really enthusiastic to have figured it out on my own. *grin* (hide spoiler) ] Conclusion: \"Under the Dome\" is a pageturner which I can recommend to every fan of King's books or thriller/dystopia/horror literature in general. It's long-winded, but it also includes many facets of emotional plotlines and characters. It's an epic story I will definitely be thinking a lot about in the near future. ...more One of the things I like best about Stephen King is that he doesn\u2019t rest on his laurels. Despite being impossibly handsome successful, he\u2019s still willing to take major risks. He\u2019s not afraid of being laughed or jeered at; he\u2019s not afraid of spectacular failure. Case in point is Under the Dome . When I read the synopsis, I actually laughed aloud at the stupidity. When I saw the cover of the book, I laughed again. Can you blame me? This book literally recycles the plot from The Simpsons Movie . The One of the things I like best about Stephen King is that he doesn\u2019t rest on his laurels. Despite being impossibly handsome successful, he\u2019s still willing to take major risks. He\u2019s not afraid of being laughed or jeered at; he\u2019s not afraid of spectacular failure. Case in point is Under the Dome . When I read the synopsis, I actually laughed aloud at the stupidity. When I saw the cover of the book, I laughed again. Can you blame me? This book literally recycles the plot from The Simpsons Movie . The only real difference is that Under the Dome does not have Spider Pig (it could have benefited from Spider Pig). It doesn\u2019t matter that Stephen King didn't actually steal from The Simpsons (he claims the idea is decades old), since even if The Simpsons Movie didn't exist, the underlying premise of Under the Dome would still resemble a half-baked and discarded episode of The Twilight Zone . The story\u2019s foundation is tired, tried and true: societal breakdown. Philosophies are exchanged. Debates are held. Cherished-yet-tenuous notions of civilization fray. It is like The Lord of the Flies or Lost or The Stand . Except there is a dome. And it is awesome. When you have a premise as ludicrous as a dome trapping the rural Maine township of Chester\u2019s Mill, there are only so many ways you can go. King goes in an entirely different direction. He takes this paper-thin conceit (worth, at best, a short story), packs it with hundreds of characters, creates dozens of plotlines, and drags the whole thing out to 1,072 pages. And those are hardcover pages. King makes it work, though it\u2019s hard to explain why. This is not a book that is solemn or dour, but it certainly isn\u2019t written with a wink-and-a-nudge. That is, Under the Dome wears its pretensions (mostly) lightly, but lacks any semblance of knowing humor, a meta-understanding that all the broad strokes of the novel already occurred to Homer and Bart a couple years before publication. I think part of Under the Dome \u2019s charm \u2013 maybe most of its charm \u2013 comes from its excesses. Its prodigious size rivals that of War and Peace . Its massive character list rivals A Song of Ice and Fire . Its belabored scenes of necrophilia\u2026stand alone. Yes, there\u2019s necrophilia. Like I said, this is a book of excesses. In Under the Dome , King is not interested in the consequences of a catastrophe; he is slavishly devoted to exploring the details of its unfolding. Besides necrophilia, there is arson and explosions and suicide and murder and accidental deaths and gang rapes and normal rapes and rampant drug use and doom, just over the horizon. About the only thing that doesn\u2019t happen in this book is a normal sex scene, because sex scenes make people uncomfortable. I suppose I shouldn\u2019t be applauding this level of violence, since it makes me sound like a psychopath. But the violence here, though described in realistic terms, isn\u2019t really realistic. This is a novel that aspires towards grand guignol. Indeed, the first couple hundred pages are devoted solely to the immediate effects of the dome coming down. People are sliced in half. Pacemakers explode. Cars and airplanes and helicopters smash into its invisible walls. King keeps racking up the body count, both to create an atmosphere of the macabre, and to make his readers forget about The Simpsons Movie . This is a 1,000 page slasher film, heavy on the shocks, low on the emotional heft. Under the Dome is many things. But it is not subtle; it is not complex. It is also only tangentially concerned with the dome itself. In many ways, the dome is a red herring. It drives the plot, but the plot is not rushing to explain the dome. To be sure, among the countless plotlines, there are people trying to explain the dome. And to be sure, King does explain the dome. Still, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m spoiling anything by saying this explanation is disappointing, and leavened with the saccharine, high-calorie-low-reality emotionalism of The Green Mile . This is not a story of man verses dome. This is a story of man (as in mankind) verses man. In Chester\u2019s Mill, the battle lines are drawn quickly (indeed, the entire book only covers about a week). There are two sides. Each side embodies one trait. On one side are the good guys; on the other side are the bad guys. That\u2019s all. There are no gray characters. There are no moral shades. There are just people wearing black hats and white hats. The only fluctuations occur when somebody, for purposes of the plot, changes hats. The bad guys are led by Second Selectman James \u201cBig Jim\u201d Rennie. He is a city councilman, a born-again Christian, a used-car salesman, and a crypto-fascist. He hates big government, refuses to drink or swear, is a stone psychopath and, more infuriatingly, a stone hypocrite. Within this expansive character is everything that Stephen King hated about the presidency of George W. Bush. Rennie uses the fall of the Twin Towers dome to install a totalitarian government, with himself at the helm. Soon, with the assistance of his equally psychotic son, Junior, he forms a personal Gestapo, takes control of the food, and \u201cdeftly\u201d uses the panicked reactions of Chester\u2019s Mill\u2019s citizens to shore up his power. (I use quotes around \u201cdeftly\u201d because everyone in this novel thinks they are smarter than they are. In fact, I think King believes them to be smarter than they are, as well). Facing off against Rennie and his henchmen is a collection of Carter Democrats who spend much of the novel wringing their hands, biting their lower lips, and wondering why their impeccable logic isn\u2019t enough to overcome Big Jim and his secret police. The leader of the white hats is Dale Barbara, or Barbie. When we first meet Barbie, he is a short-order cook. Later we learn that he is an Iraq War veteran (with a troubled past, of course). All you really need to know about Barbie is that he\u2019s former Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry: competent, well-meaning, impotent. Despite being an actual war hero, as opposed to a fat old used car salesman, Barbie can\u2019t quite seem to outthink or outfight that chicken-hawk Bush Big Jim. I suppose this is the most infuriating part of Under the Dome , if Under the Dome had the ability to rouse me to fury. The putative good guys are wimps; the obvious bad guys are efficient and effective. After awhile, I started to hate the good guys and grudgingly respect the bad guys. In other words, as King (admittedly) intended, it's a parable for registered Democrats of the years 2000-2008. (Lest you think I am endorsing any particular political view, or get the impression this book is just an overlong edition of The Nation , I should remind you all about the necrophilia. It starts right away. Like, you just start reading, and there it is. And it doesn't go away. Necrophilia knows no political party). While reading, I kept thinking of that Edmund Burke quote, and about how these so-called good guys, led by Barbie and supported by a do-gooder journalist and a physicians\u2019 assistant, really deserved to \u201cfall one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.\u201d These are people who are so stupid, they actually tell their plans to the bad guys before executing the plan, thereby giving the bad guy a chance to learn the plan and foil it. Good against evil is a King hallmark. Other familiar King attributes include facile religiosity, shared dreams, and a \u201cdeeper meaning\u201d that is delivered straight to the reader\u2019s forehead with the delicateness of a sledgehammer blow. King is undisputedly a master storyteller. When I start reading something by him, I always finish, without exception. Even though I\u2019m a slow reader, I\u2019m always surprised how quickly I finish off his tomes, even the ones that are cinderblock-sized. Despite this, King\u2019s quirks and tics can get a little irritating, especially over 1,000 pages. Under the Dome , like just about everything else he writes, is a pop cultural dumping zone. At times, it reads like an extended episode of I Love the 90s . There are innumerable references to books, songs, movies, televisions shows and so forth. A lot of time, this material is shoehorned into the execrable dialogue, apparently as an attempt at verisimilitude. Unfortunately, pop cultural references alone are not enough to approximate actual human speech. (And what is up with King\u2019s rampant use of nicknames? In what must be another attempt to replicate how people talk, King forces all his characters to refer to one another by nicknames. And by nicknames, I mean that one character will simply shorten the other character\u2019s name. Thus, Barbara becomes Barbie and Thurston becomes Thurse and Caroline becomes Caro and etc., etc. There are more diminutives here than in any Russian novel. I just about reached a breaking point when one character begins referring to Junior Rennie as \u201cJunes.\u201d Really? Isn\u2019t Junior nickname enough? Now you\u2019re giving nicknames to the nicknames?). Having read a half dozen King novels, I must confess to be mysteriously under his spell. Even now, as I type these words, I can open up any random page of Under the Dome and be annoyed by a crappy line of dialogue, an expired reference, or a worn-out characterization. Yet I never stopped reading for a second. I barely ever slowed. When it comes down to it, Under the Dome is a delightful mess. The parts that bugged me mesh so well with the parts that tickled me that my love and my hate became almost seamless. My love for Under the Dome was sealed around the time I realized that King would never be able to pay off all his different story threads and that he was going to end this novel in some crazy fashion that would make me forget all the meandering digressions, narrative cul-de-sacs, and hokey sentimentality. Based on Stephen King\u2019s own remarks about Under the Dome , I get the sense that he takes it kind of seriously. I guess I shouldn\u2019t act surprised. After all, many of the thematic elements were written as a personal response to certain external political stimuli. For me, though, this is really just a low-brow high-wire act. It is entirely enjoyable for completely disreputable reasons. ...more", "Title": "Under the Dome"},
