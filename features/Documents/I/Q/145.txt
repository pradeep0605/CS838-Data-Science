What a find. It did take me a couple of pages to settle in with this story but I was hooked from then on. A novel about a young man, his friends and a few months in their lives shown deftly in the hilarious, droll, sometimes very serious but always brilliant words of Zadie Smith. Alex-Li Tandem is half Chinese, is Jewish, has a black girlfriend, a best mate who's a Rabbi and another one who (<---B>view spoiler</---B>) [is secretly in love with him (hide spoiler) ] . He's writing his own book on the differences between Jewish and Goyish and he's an Autograph Man \u2013 he buys and sells autographs of famous people. His father died when he was fifteen and now at twenty-seven, it's coming up for his father's shul to be offered on his anniversary; something Alex has always failed to do so far. He has had a lifetime devotion to a famous 1940s movie-star but has never managed to acquire her autograph. Alex has always felt himself to be something of a failure but life is about to deal him some hands he never thought possible. Loved it, loved it, loved it. The humor is sly and the descriptions have be Smith's own kind of wonderful. It is sassy and philosophical, it's warm-hearted and funny, it's wise and irreverent. I borrowed a copy from the library but I'm about to purchase one for myself. One of the best reads I've had this year. 5\u2605 ...more ORIGINAL REVIEW: James Wood in his thesis review covers all the thoughts I had on this one (and more and more) and is the most worthwhile review of this book around.

For those who aren\u2019t that interested, let me sum up the basics: lapsed Anglo-Chinese Jew Alex-Li is an autograph hunter fixated on Kitty Alexander, fictional Hollywood starlet of the 1950s. He spends his time writing a book on Jews v . Christians, spurning his faith, squabbling with rabbis, upsetting his bald girlfriend and cavorting with fellow autograph hunters. In the latter half of the book he meets his idol and develops inner demons. Smith\u2019s other novels are vast multi-character epics and her towering authorial presence benefits from having numerous dummies to manipulate, rather than the one insubstantial dummy. This novel could have benefitted from a less grandiose scope for quite a thin plot and morose protagonist: a slim 250 pages over a hoggish 419. On the plus side, the prose is as comic, stylish and rhythmic as ever, though her longer meandering passages feel like failed snippets from White Teeth . Hats off for writing a radically different second book\u2014Zadie put up with some hostility in the UK round about this time. APPENDED MOAN FOUND IN DOCUMENTS FOLDER: It does bug me quite how many readers think they have the right to desecrate a writer\u2019s work on here with their off-handed dismissals and oh-so-clever putdowns, usually \u201csteaming pile of . . . \u201d or \u201ca complete waste of . . . \u201d What gives a casual reader the right to take such a stance about someone else\u2019s passionate labour other than sheer spite? Where is this spite coming from? Has the book personally offended you? OK, so you dislike the book. Fine! I can understand the plot or characters didn\u2019t ring your bell, but honestly . . . haven\u2019t we grown as readers enough to weigh a book on its merits? Unless a book offends on a level of stance, in terms of the author\u2019s questionable views, the reviewer should give due weight to each element of the writer\u2019s craft. If they still find it wanting after this, fine! But the arrogance of these people who dismiss books with witless rejoinders\u2014\u201cwritten by a sophomore student,\u201d or\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve could churned out something better in grad school.\u201d ARE YOU ALL MAD? This book, and Zadie Smith in particular, is a fine example of this bizarre persecution. Do you know how difficult it is to write a book like <+++>The Autograph Man</+++> ? This is why the publishing desks are clotted with ream after ream of dreck: people flinging themselves into writing who haven\u2019t the ability to appreciate an example of lyrical, witty and vital prose, what makes writer like Smith simultaneously as popular as she is cutting-edge. This disgruntlement is part of a wider beef about our obsession with \u201cgrading\u201d artworks on their merits\u2014surely, with such a ruthless system of critical appraisal around books, music, cinema, TV, we\u2019d filter what is \u201callowed\u201d to get made, what people might want to see based on the endless chatter of feedback\u2014but instead, we have a mainstream that celebrates the lowest common denominator, and an avant-garde relentlessly bitching over what gets published and deemed \u201ccutting edge.\u201d The line between popular and artistic is being tugged to breaking point, whereas a writer like Smith straddles this line, offering a neutral pleasure for both territories. And we moan and moan! OK. I\u2019m done. ...more How can you possibly follow up White Teeth ? Well you can't, but Smith gives us a very different but equally enjoyable novel. The plot of <+++>The Autograph Man</+++> is, shall we say, a bit more conventional than White Teeth . Smith's wonderful ability to capture speech in her prose is as admirable here as ever and importantly, it's funny! Sadly this novel has been relegated to the sidelines by all of her other novels but true Smith fans will read this and keep it as their dirty little secret. What started out as a promising read quickly turned into a...really crappy one. I know this makes me sound somewhat like a whiny seventh grader when I say this, but god, this book was booooorring. I read the entire thing hoping that at some point it'd turn the corner and pick up the pace, but no, it just basically ground itself out into a completely anti-climactic ending. But before that we got pages and pages of...I don't even know what, I disliked this book so much that I immediately purged it What started out as a promising read quickly turned into a...really crappy one.

But before that we got pages and pages of...I don't even know what, I disliked this book so much that I immediately purged it from my mind upon finishing it. I think there were some ramblings about Jewish mysticism, autographs, and then some more Jewish mysticism, and then more about autographs. I wanted to claw my eyes out by the end of the book. Another thing that also dampened my reading experience was the fact that I hated the main character. I mean, I love as much as the next person the idea of the deeply-flawed-yet-still-very-sympathetic character, but I found nothing at all redeeming about Alex-Li Tandem. Instead, I found myself constantly wishing I could reach into the book and kick him in the head. In conclusion, I recommend this book to no one. ...more I enjoyed Smith's writing style far more than I enjoyed the plot (which promised some things but delivered others) or the characters (who are neatly drawn, but on paper that is very thin indeed); but even the sometimes whimsical, sometimes nervy, sometimes delightful turns of her prose weren't enough to save The Autograph Man from being something of a disappointment. It's more mature in some ways than White Teeth, darker, and I would imagine in many ways a reflection on Smith's part on the fame I enjoyed Smith's writing style far more than I enjoyed the plot (which promised some things but delivered others) or the characters (who are neatly drawn, but on paper that is very thin indeed); but even the sometimes whimsical, sometimes nervy, sometimes delightful turns of her prose weren't enough to save The Autograph Man from being something of a disappointment. It's more mature in some ways than White Teeth, darker, and I would imagine in many ways a reflection on Smith's part on the fame which she received thanks to her first novel\u2014certainly, I think, that was the reason behind the emphasis on fame and multiculturalism in this novel. And yet a lot of it seems ephemeral, shallow: full of aphorisms which seem fake and showy in her characters' mouths; reflections and obsessions on Judaism that seem like they could only have come from someone who isn't Jewish; signs and symbols which mean nothing, an empty kind of moralism. Disappointing. ...more One of the single most memorable books I've ever read and totally underappreciated. It's so good. It's about a young man totally at a loss in his life and he has to do a lot of stupid things to realize he actually has it all pretty good.

I think Smith just has a lot of talent but is often constrained by others expectations of her talent. I think she knew that everyone expects the sophomore effort to suck, so she planned for it to suck, didn't worry about it and wrote a book so unbelievably effing good that I can't imagine she'll ever manage this sort of achievement again. And I'm sure pretty much no one agrees with me on this one, but there it is. This book is one of my all time favorites. Definitely. I don't re-read many books, but I've read this twice and I have no doubt I will reading it again. ...more My first acquaintance with Zadie Smith's work, The Autograph Man has left me convinced of her far-reaching talent. While this book has plenty of flaws, Ms. Smith's story-telling exuberance (for me) wins out and makes my beefs with it seem picayune by comparison.

We follow Alex-Li Tandem, Chinese/English/confused Jew/young alkie/stoner/titular \"Autograph Man\" as he tries (mostly unsuccessfully) to get past the death of his father thirteen years prior. He's pretty much stuck in Schlub-land, getting stoned and drunk all the time, ignoring his girlfriend working in a go-nowhere profession as an autograph dealer. His life takes a fortuitous turn as he pursues the autograph of his childhood idol, Kitty Alexander, an actress from the 1950's long removed from the public eye. While I don't agree with most of the criticisms of this book ( The Autograph Man is, with a 3.1-star cume Goodreads average, the lowest-rated of Ms. Smith's four novels), she does leave herself open for critical attack. Alex is quite unlikable, the story rambles on quite a bit, the ending is, well...not exactly satisfying. Ms. Smith, though, surrounds our protagonist with three childhood friends; their banter is at times hilarious and make up for Alex's unsympathetic character flaws. The story is consistently engaging and clever. If you're even casually interested in Judaica, old movies, or schlubby characters in search of themselves, I recommend this book to you. Don't let the low GR rating dissuade you (as it almost did me.) ...more \u039f \u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd

I found The Autograph Man on a bookshelf in the teacher's lounge at my school and immediately picked it up. The story was difficult to get into at first, as the main character, Alex Li-Tandem, didn't start off being too sympathetic or relatable. Alex is half-Chinese and half-Jewish, but it's the half-Jewish part that gets the most attention in the book. Alex has Jewish friends who smoke pot and spend their days pondering Jewish mysticism, and he has a black Jewish girlfriend. All in all, this book is incredibly diverse without overtly advertising that fact. Alex is an autograph man, he collects signatures from celebrities (a habit he picks up from a childhood friend) and sells them on to fans and other collectors. He has collected autographs from hundreds of celebrities, but he's missing the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of his collection, the signature of Kitty Alexander. After a drunken night out, he inexplicably finds a copy that she has sent to him, and that discovery sets him on a journey, to find the elusive 40's star. There's not too much to be said about the plot here, nothing particularly of note happens. However, what I loved about the novel was Smith's use of language and power of description. I found myself thinking of sentences and phrases hours after reading them. Though much of Smith's discussion of Jewish mysticism passed over my head, I was nonetheless intrigued and eager to read. ...more I'd delayed reading this book for many years because of the mediocre reviews but there it was: a lone English novel, in a Spanish book shop, so I decided to take the plunge.

This feels like it was difficult to write; you can sense the sections where Smith must have thrown up her hands in despair. It makes several clunky attempts to offer insight into the vapid nature of celebrity but it feels painfully forced - a reference to a bird singing the first notes of a popular show tune made me blush - and the Jewish/Goyish thing, although amusing at first, quickly becomes infuriating. I always despair of reviews that complain of the lack of 'likeable characters', but you know a novel is in trouble when you could quite happily punch the noses of those with whom the author intends you to sympathise. Alex is meant to be irksome (I presume) but Adam is just a massive pain in the arse. (Is suspicion of the over earnest a Goyish thing?) By some coincidence I started rereading London Fields halfway through (out of despair and necessity) and the similarities between Smith and Amis and their approach to tales of the city are striking, but Amis wrote about young lust, when he was in his precocious phase, and Smith has attempted to tackle something that Amis wisely left alone for a few years.

At one point, it is an asset then, at the next, it is a liability. This is because nobody is the master of fame and everyone, even the Brad Pitts and the Angelina Jolies of the world will fade into obscurity. The only people who can profit and prosper from fame are those from the outside of fame, those that make the fame of others their source of livelihood. They are called Autograph Men, those who sell the signature of famous people varying from Star Wars-era Harrison Ford to the taboo that is Adolf Hitler. Only such men, these Autograph Men, can make fame an ally. Zadie Smith's The Autograph Man is a story of such a man mentioned above. Alex-Li Tadem, a half-Chinese, half-Jewish man who walks through life peddling the signature of others; offering to people the chance to experience and own a sliver of other people's fame for a price, of course. For Alex-Li, his ultimate goal is to get an autograph Kitty Alexander, a reclusive star of Hollywood's Golden Age, who rarely gives autographs and memorabilia. For Alex-Li, Kitty Alexander is the Holy Grail and he is one of King Arthur's knights who will do anything to get it. In this case, \"anything\" constitutes writing letters to Kitty. Alex-Li's world is overturned when, after a very wild trip due to drugs, he acquires two autographs of Kitty Alexander. From this point, the story goes haywire with Alex-Li being questioned about the authenticity of the autographs; Alex-Li going to New York to participate in an autograph convention and visit the home of Kitty Alexander; encountering a mysophobic prostitute; Kitty Alexander living in his home; dealing with his father's death; dealing with his friends, girlfriend and mistress; and imbibing different alcoholic drinks alphabetically. The people in Alex-Li\u2019s life are as much a character as Alex-Li himself. Accompanying him in the colorful cast of characters is his girlfriend Esther, a lovely girl whose only fault for Alex-Li is that she is real to him unlike Kitty Alexander; Adam, Esther's brother and Alex-Li's best friend, who is a very devout Jew who engages in the occasional (read: a lot) joint; Joseph, another friend of Alex, a former Autograph Man who is now an insurance salesman who envies Alex-Li's vocation and love life; and Rabbi Max, another friend, who is a rabbi that tries to guide Alex through the Jewish faith while fitting Brobdingnagian furniture in Lilliputian cars. These are the core characters, including Kitty Alexander that helps move the plot forward, backward, and sideways. The story is not conventional as it does not follow a specific plot. It is more of \"a week in the life\" kind of story that details what happens to Alex-Li in the course of a week. The story is interposed with a lot of graphic and written intermissions in the form of jokes, drawings, Jewish illustrations, and (in the case of the prologue) the four-letter word for the name that cannot be named of the Jewish faith. All of this, along with Zadie Smith's mastery of language, creates a rich and textured book even though it only clocks at around 340 pages. All in all, it gave me an insight into the inner workings of fame, as interpreted by Zadie Smith. We see characters who try to catch a sliver of this elusive good and yet not everyone is successful in this endeavor. One has to suffer, as some of the characters in the book did, embarrassment, neglect, ridicule, and even death. Being an Autograph Man is not only a business because it is also a sacrifice. Alex-Li sacrificed his relationships, his cleanliness, and his health just to complete his search for his Holy Grail. And, in the end, did he achieve the only thing, which is the resurrection of his father that can make him happy? Sadly, no. The Autograph Man is a good book that exceeded my expectations since I have read that this is Zadie Smith's weakest work of fiction. If this is indeed her weakest work, I am now more excited to read her other books especially her magnum opus, White Teeth. ...more One of the problems with this book, is that it will inevitably be read with 'White Teeth' in mind, and unfortunately, it really doesn't compare.

As it is, most of his friends figure he's finally snapped and forged the priceless memento himself. So begins \"The Autograph Man\", Zadie Smith's followup to her blockbuster first novel \"White Teeth\". Smith is a fan of classic British comedy, and she's at her best with scenes filled with eccentric characters who don't notice how crazily they're acting. In one such, Alex runs into his obnoxious friend Rabbi Rubinfine helping two other rabbis load a Georgian bookcase into the trunk of a subcompact car. Rubinfine wants to pontificate about Alex's spiritual problems; he also needs help with the bookcase. It's funny to start off with, but becomes even better as the rabbis argue the fine points of Rubinfine's lecture and practically beg Alex to sell them Bette Davis' autograph. There's a serious theme here as well; Alex-Li, half Chinese and half Jewish, feels alienated from both cultures, and especially from the memory of his father, for whom he still can't bring himself to say Kaddish (the Jewish mourner's prayer). The autograph he longs for is a symbol of his whole conflicted situation-- an authentic signature by a fake Hollywood persona. At times, though, Smith gets distracted by her own verbal cleverness. Things get classified as Jewish (chocolate, John Lennon) and Goyish (mocha lattes, Harrison Ford). Physical mannerisms become \"International Gestures\", complete with spotter's guide entries: \"the throwing back of head, the slight indent of front teeth on lower lip, the making of the sound 'pfui'.\" It is clever to start off with, but too much of it makes the middle third of the book drag. \"Autograph Man\" isn't as vibrant as \"White Teeth\" was, perhaps because Alex and his slacker friends can't work up much suspense. But it's certainly not bad-- most of the time it's amusing, and it earns its way towards a satisfying conclusion that offers the possibility of redemption without wrapping things up too neatly. Like a proper Jewish god, Smith shows her characters both justice and mercy, putting their faults on display, but managing to keep them likeable anyway. Readers should do the same: \"Autograph Man\" has obvious flaws, but it's still easy to enjoy.

An unmatched feeling (exclusive to the luxury of reading for pleasure) constantly arises: I read, I stare at a household object or tree and repeat the gifted string of words, thinking, how in the world did anyone know to write this? How did Smith know to wrap up the humour of philography, the elusiveness of fame, the over-the-top sanctity of religious belief, and the ongoing effort to reconcile with death all in one go? It seems absurd in theory, but I seem to have an inimitable connection with the product of her many hours of brilliance. I've been aching for that feeling of wonder from my younger days for so long--you have no idea. It was previously reserved for classics like \"Matilda,\" then \"The Secret Garden,\" then \"The Catcher in the Rye.\" More recently, \"The Namesake.\" It's come again, with the adorable Alex-Li Tandem and his oddly- or wonderfully-shaped and spoken friends and acquantainces. Really, this is hardly a magnificent review or an adequate description of the work, just a sentimental few paragraphs of HOW MUCH I LOVE ZADIE SMITH. But, you should know, concerning points of interest: Chinese Jewish professional autograph man (check) African girlfriend with a pacemaker (check) London, New York (check) Heaps of tea and booze (check) Both heaps of Torah and goyishness (check) A million thanks, Zadie!

Three kids and a father go to a wrestling match between Big Daddy and Haystacks and the one child gets an autograph. Only by reading reviews of the book did I realise that the father died during the scramble to get the autograph. This is even after revisiting the section! Incredible. Then the stort meanders on as the kids are in their mid twenties. Alex Li Tandem is half chinese, half jewish and all dull. He lives a slacker life trading autographs, eventually travelling to America to a collection fayre where he tracks down the elusive Kitty and collect artifacts that make him money. Whereas On Beauty was full of excellent charaterisation - this was bland beyond belief. Chapter headings tried to tie in with Kabbalism, whcih I know nothing about and the whole story (for what there was) lurched from nothingness to nothingness with no drama or interest. As you would expect, there were some smart observations and turns of phrase but the end (especially the end) was dull beyond belief and a relief to finish.

This is a book you have to work on, like a study routine. I had to push myself to read a few portions each day. The beginning is dry but the pace picks up midway. The passages on Judaism, Goyishness and Buddhism featuring both the rational and blind aspects are a joy to read. The idea of a story set in an autograph market is fresh. However Zadie could have written a crisper work by cutting down a 100 pages. I would recommend this if you want to explore some good writing in contemporary literature, else its a big NO. ...more I was trying to decide between four and five stars which is kind of ridiculous because Smith is an extraordinary writer.

I much preferred the second part to the first but not enough to say that I would read it again or recommend it. It's ok, but there's better out there. This book gives the international gesture of 1 finger down your throat. Appalling, I deserve a medal or an insanity check for finishing this.

C'est le dernier roman de Zadie Smith qu'il me restait \u00e0 lire & je trouve que, m\u00eame s'il est un peu maladroit, il s'ins\u00e8re bien dans le reste de son \u0153uvre. On y retrouve Londres, les joies & les mis\u00e8res du multiculturalisme ; on y retrouve ces personnages irr\u00e9m\u00e9diablement imparfaits & toujours un peu exasp\u00e9rants ; on y retrouve les dialogues de Zadie Smith, si bien construits, & son humour. Ce n'est pas aussi bien ficel\u00e9 que \u00e7a pourrait l'\u00eatre. Le cr\u00e8mage manque un peu de sucre. Mais moi je l'ai lu sans peine, avec beaucoup de plaisir. Pour commencer par le commencement : Alex-Li Tandem approche la trentaine, habite en banlieue de Londres & est autographiste de profession. Ce n'est pas un loisir, c'est un m\u00e9tier : il traque les autographes, les \u00e9change & les revend, en \u00e9value l'authenticit\u00e9. Son meilleur ami est un semi-illumin\u00e9 captiv\u00e9 par la Kabbale juive ; sa blonde a dans la poitrine un pacemaker qui arrive \u00e0 \u00e9ch\u00e9ance ; son p\u00e8re est mort quand Alex avait douze ou treize ans, juste apr\u00e8s un glorieux match de lutte entre Big Daddy & Giant Haystacks (oui oui). La vie d'Alex est un peu brouillonne, elle part dans tous les sens -- & l'intrigue du livre aussi, on se le cachera pas. Mais l'existence de notre h\u00e9ros est port\u00e9e par une obsession singuli\u00e8re : celle d'obtenir l'autographe de Kitty Alexander, ancienne starlette du Golden Age hollywoodien, maintenant \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s tomb\u00e9e dans l'oubli. C'est une qu\u00eate qui touche \u00e0 l'absolu & qui se met les pieds direct dans le ridicule ; c'est \u00e0 l'image du roman, j'imagine, & \u00e0 ce qu'il essaie de nous dire. Je pense que pour appr\u00e9cier ce livre, il faut \u00eatre capable de se r\u00e9soudre \u00e0 deux choses : 1) Alex-Li Tandem ne sera jamais un \u00eatre productif & fonctionnel (ou m\u00eame fondamentalement sympathique ) aux sens stricts de ces termes ; 2) tous les passages sur la Torah & la Kabbale & le juda\u00efsme ne m\u00e8neront nulle part -- & \u00e7a j'imagine que c'est possiblement un commentaire tr\u00e8s cynique sur la valeur des rituels & de la religion, mais j'avoue que \u00e7a m'int\u00e9resse semi, donc. Une fois ces deux aspects r\u00e9gl\u00e9s (& les attentes modul\u00e9es en cons\u00e9quence), c'est difficile de ne pas au moins un peu aimer un roman qui en donne tellement : tellement d'id\u00e9es, tellement de personnages, tellement de bouts d'intrigue qui finissent en cul-de-sac, tellement de morceaux d'une prose parfaite & parfaitement limpide, cristalline, ac\u00e9r\u00e9e. & m\u00eame une \u00e9bauche d'\u00e9tude sur les hipsters de Brooklyn qui date de deux mille deux , mesdames & messieurs. Je sais que Zadie Smith est devenue (relativement) pas mal c\u00e9l\u00e8bre avec la publication de White Teeth , & c'est surtout \u00e0 \u00e7a que j'ai pens\u00e9 en lisant ce roman : comment l'exp\u00e9rience de la c\u00e9l\u00e9brit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre troublante, comment elle doit bouleverser la vision qu'on a de soi-m\u00eame.

I really enjoyed her style.

She uses very modern characters and deliberately chooses unique and sometimes surprising ethnic/social/economic groups to make them fresh and interesting - the main character is Alex-Li Tandem, a half-Chinese Jew who trades in autographs. Her characters all have a comic feel to them but she sketches them in a respectful way and they still seem (just about) believable. She uses a lot of dialogue. She's not afraid to gently poke fun at the way people of different backgrounds say things. It's the conversation between the characters that shapes the story, provides the (many) comic moments and keeps the plot developing. The arc of the plot is interesting if a little odd. It's primarily a book about a young man searching for some kind of meaning or success in his life - like a hundred other books. In this case, success means securing the autograph of Kitty Alexander, a washed up ex-Hollywood actress. I assumed Tandem's quest would peter out and end in misery, but the book takes a surprising turn when Tandem travels to America and finds Kitty. It then becomes a story about what achieving your dream actually means (not very much) and leads on to a new comic series of events but unfortunately not much in the way of new insight into the characters. I did like the ending though - I won't give it away but it's simple, poignant and ties the book up nicely. I'd definitely read Zadie Smith again. The Autograph Man wasn't a classic but I enjoyed her style and I think I'd like to give White Teeth a try next. 7/10 ...more Of all of Ms. Smith's books, \"The Autograph Man,\" her second novel, garnered the most mixed reaction, which is why I read it last. I can certainly understand the disappointment for those critics and fans who awaited its arrival after her stunning debut, \"White Teeth.\" Its tone, especially in the first half, is somber and claustrophobic, as the reader follows the protagonist, Alex Li-Tandem, through the aftermath of a drug-induced hangover as he prepares for the anniversary of his father's death. Of all of Ms. Smith's books, \"The Autograph Man,\" her second novel, garnered the most mixed reaction, which is why I read it last. I can certainly understand the disappointment for those critics and fans who awaited its arrival after her stunning debut, \"White Teeth.\" Its tone, especially in the first half, is somber and claustrophobic, as the reader follows the protagonist, Alex Li-Tandem, through the aftermath of a drug-induced hangover as he prepares for the anniversary of his father's death. It takes a good hundred and fifty pages before the narrative picks up speed, a plot, and finally a broader cast of characters, which is always where this authors shines, her biggest gift being the ability to capture the voices and inner lives of men and women from a multitude of ages, races and socioeconomic roles. In this second half, the title and ruminations on fame that seemed so esoteric in the first half come to gripping life as Alex travels to New York in search of a reclusive star and meets an unlikely companion on his journey. But, it's the ending, which in both her more lauded first and third novels she was criticized for over stage-managing, where this novel shines, for though the plot comes to a pleasing conclusion, the characters are all left in very recognizable places of transition, between my generation's extended adolescence and adulthood, a threshold where we must look at faith, love and the relationships in our lives and realize that no amount of pop culture savvy can save us. ...more I\u2019m not sure how to rate this book. Until the end I would have said \"liked it ok\"; however, the epilogue, during the service for Alex-Li\u2019s father, I think is brilliant in the way it simultaneously conjoins and separates God and the very human act of fidgeting and in the way fidgeting may supplant the role of God, in the way it sustains us--because we need something to--and fidgeting is tangible. Alex-Li is looking for something tangible. Coming off the chapter before it when Alex-Li finally offe I\u2019m not sure how to rate this book.

Alex-Li is looking for something tangible. Coming off the chapter before it when Alex-Li finally offers some emotion about his father, the epilogue has a profound and wondrous impact in the way it reaches back to the first section of the book, when the boys were young and Alex-Li\u2019s father was still alive (the other part of the book I enjoyed the most), and sort of hugs the book together into its whole. The first third of the book and possibly more (following the section when the boys were young) could have been condensed. Though I think it\u2019s probably part of the emotional mechanism of the tale of Alex-Li to be such, I felt too distant from things for too long\u2014to a point where I began to care less and less about him and also about the book. All that said, the end of this book is made me reconsider the rest of it--a nice surprise when I thought I might leave the book forgetful of it. ...more And now, for the first time, I can wait for Zadie Smith's next novel, having read all her published novels.

What lacks there though is amply compensated by the wit and charm, and a sleepwalking kind of narrative where Alex-Li Tandem, as the title suggest, an Autograph Man, scrapes through his life trying to find himself. That search, not a very purposeful, is so typical of the post-modern existence, that's Ms. Smith has, to use a contemporary phrase, nailed it. Coming after her critically acclaimed debut novel \"White Teeth\", this was always going to be difficult book to write. It's a kind of monkey everyone wants off their back. And there are elements of that \"rush\" here, but what really redeems it, after a somewhat weak middle, is the end, where she opens it up, in every which way, and then resists the need to close it all out, making it a brilliant post-modern ending. I'll take a star away, because it's a Zadie Smith book, and it has to share ratings with On Beauty, and White Teeth. But it's a delightful read nonetheless. ...more A loyal Zadie Smith fan and avid reader of her books made me skeptical about some of the harsher reactions to this one, yet sadly I have to admit I am equally disappointed and perhaps even offended at the quality of this work when we know she can do so much better.

She doesn't seem to have put much thought in to this, and was instead rolling off the attention high from the praise for White Teeth. Smith's work is often unrefined which is something I love so much because you can really hear her voice, wit, and humor. There are still a few laugh out loud moments in Autograph Man, however this one is put together poorly overall. The characters have potential, but are for the most part under-developed. Even the main character Alex is unrelatable and unsympathetic. The best part of the book is the prologue where Alex takes a trip to a wrestling match with his childhood friends and father. The rest of the book ruminates on these characters, using them time and again to serve a purpose in Alex's life, but it is all contrived, gimmicky, superficial and sorry to say... utter crap. ...more After reading \"White Teeth,\" I probably had unreasonably high expectations for \"The Autograph Man.\" A book centered around the life of a man who hustles autographs, has myserious substance abuse problems, and an obsession with a timeless film icon - this book lacked the magic.

I didn't care about the characters on the same deep level as in \"White Teeth\" - and their lives didn't intertwine in a meaningful way that I could appreciate. This novel seemed all over the place and even-sappy? I'm sure I'm being overly harsh since her previous book is definitely a new favorite for me. On a positive note, there is still that signature Zadie Smith wisdom and transcendence. She is a master of the witty and poignant - and even though this plot lacked direction for me, I still think that she is a phenomenal writer. In particular, I love that she referenced Rasputin in a book centered around the buying and selling of stardom. She is able to tell a story, while having side conversations that are culturally and socially relavent. ...more Well, I hear that this isn't Zadie Smith's best work and now I'm saddened because I now have no desire to read anything else she has ever written.
