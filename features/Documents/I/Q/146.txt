I don't know why people are saying it was slow moving. I loved the pace. It's a character piece, and the suspense is in the slow and detailed unfolding of their lives and secret thoughts. To me, this book is a lot about what people think every day, but never reveal to each other, and how that affects what they can and can't say (or do) later. And, I liked that the author took a hard stance against animal activists -- not because I have anything against them. Like most of us, I tend to assume that, \"Animal activists are GOOD people, becaue they're saving animals, aren't they???!?!?\" And, I didn't think less of any actual animal activists after I read the book. It just reminded me that things aren't always what they seem. An occupation does not define a man -- contrary to popular belief, lawyers aren't necessarily selfish and money-grubbing, actors aren't necessarily narcissistic, doctors aren't necessarily altruistic, and animal activists come in all shapes and sizes and moral character as well. Anyway, I can understand that not everyone enjoyed this book, but I thought it was one of my favorite all-time reads. I loved the dialogue. I thought every moment of the book was packed with meaning. Every detail of every conversation was significant to the story in some small way, I didn't want to miss a word. But, hey, I'm also a slow reader, so EVERY book is slow to me! HAH! ...more I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. The book had a slow start & I stuck with it thinking that it would get better, but it dragged on & on. The problem with the book is that you already knew what was going to happen & you think that there will be a climax but it maintains the same pace throughout. When I finished this book I was just happy it was over. Meh. I liked \"Midwives\" enough to give this one a try (but mainly because I'm out of books to read, too poor to shop, and too lazy at the moment to go to the library, and this book was crammed in my nightstand from some long-ago time when someone loaned it to me). I guess what I didn't like about it is the fact that at the end of the book I sort of shrugged and said \"so?\" You meet a circle of people and a tragedy occurs and then the circle of people go through the various stages of grief and...t Meh.

I guess what I didn't like about it is the fact that at the end of the book I sort of shrugged and said \"so?\" You meet a circle of people and a tragedy occurs and then the circle of people go through the various stages of grief and...that's about it. You get to know these people pretty well, but, you don't necessarily care very much about them, especially since the one person most physically affected by the tragedy is also the most unlikable character (among several, frankly), and the author works hard, I think, to MAKE him unlikable; therefore, I don't care too much about what happens to any of them. I also had a hard time believing a fairly sheltered, reasonably self-possessed, upper middle class Vermont-living 10-year-old (TEN!!!) would happily, willingly suck down a beer and a half a joint under the most minimal of peer pressure, but, maybe I'm just starry-eyed. I dunno. The ten-year-olds I once worked with just would have wrinkled up their noses. The middle school kids? Absolutely. The book may have worked a little better, actually, as a young adult book, if it had focused on the 12-year-old more, now that I think of it. Well, whatever. Like I said...meh. ...more I am a little unsure how I feel about this book. There is a lot here: gun control issues, animal rights issues, pre-teen drug/alcohol use, multi-generational relationships, etc. I did appreciate that the initial defining moment (a twelve year old girl accidentally shoots her father) didn't go down the expected \"Janie's Gotta Gun\"- (apologies to Aerosmith) road but I still didn't think the book was as good as it could have been.

It seems to me that many famous authors today could use slightly stronger editors; the books are good but suffer from sections that drag or are incredibly repetitive. Are the editors afraid of offending one of the prize writers? This is one of those books that would really have benefitted from some strong trimming. There were times I wanted to say, \"I get it, we don't need to dwell on this/return to this.\" I would only recommend this book to people who are already fans of Chris B. or have strong feelings on gun control/animal rights who might be interested in those angles of the story. ...more I really enjoyed Bohjalian's book \"Midwives\" but I just couldn't get interested in any of the characters in this book. I pushed through it, thinking it would get better, but at the end, I still didn't care about any of these people. I'm just going to come out and say it: I really didn't like this book.

I think this will be my last Bohjalian book, at least for a while. The plot was somewhat interesting and could have been salvaged if it was approached differently. But the story arc was so odd and didn't lead up to anything. There was something that resembled a climax but that came very early on in the book. The rest, both before and after the central event, was pretty much comprised exclusively of characters thinking things. I got so sick of reading different characters' thoughts. And Bohjalian was so awful at describing these thoughts. It felt like the whole book was just a stream of consciousness of each character. He did nothing to alter his style when he described the thoughts of a 10-year-old girl or a 70-something grandmother. I found myself not believing a word anyone in the story was thinking. There was also the fact that I found all of the characters very flat and boring. None of them developed at all throughout the book. And honestly, I kept getting them all confused because there was nothing distinct about any of them. The last thing I'm going to say is that Bohjalian included so much unnecessary description that got ridiculously boring and tedious to read. He described the outfit of every new character he introduced as well as the main characters at each new scene. He described each character's thoughts about the silliest things that didn't have anything to do with the plot and added nothing to the book. A lot of the characters themselves added nothing to the book, and only served to confuse me more because I kept forgetting who they were. To sum up, I didn't like this book. It took me forever to finish because I didn't like reading it. I would not recommend it. ...more I didn't really care for this book very much. I didn't mind the slow pace that much. What bothered me most was that the author failed to establish a separate and believable voice for each of his characters. Even when the reader was privy to a character's thoughts, there was no intimacy in the way the character thought of or referred to a loved one, no language/vocabulary appropriate to the character's age or personality. Perhaps the author inserted his own voice too much into each character. Any I didn't really care for this book very much. I didn't mind the slow pace that much.

Perhaps the author inserted his own voice too much into each character. Anyway, I found myself unable to really care about any of the characters. And another issue I had with the book is the author's portrayal of vegetarians, vegans, and animal rights activists. The portrayals were pretty much all extremes, and when there are lots of stories told about such people, a story focusing on the extreme is accepted as just one story and not representative of all. When there are relatively few stories told about a particular type of person, almost any story told will be read as a description in general of all people in that group. I would say that most vegetarians voluntarily abstain from meat and don't secretly eat Slim Jims and nasty fast food hamburgers. Most vegans don't lecture and berate other people about their food habits, and instead, make sure to bring their own food to social events so as not to make a scene for other people. Most animal rights activists like and care about people as well as animals. Bohjalian's book has the potential to create false stereotypes. ...more I am a fan of <---A>Chris Bohjalian</---A>, having read several of his books and I do plan to read him again.

The topic of gun control, animal rights, and veganism was definitely interesting, but I struggled a bit with the author's portrayal of the animal rights issue.

First, it takes a complicated issue and (no, I'm not going to say it makes it simple because it doesn't) looks at it from all angles. When 12-year-old Charlotte picks up a hunting rifle from the trunk of her uncle's car and accidentally shoots her father, Spencer, the communications director of an animal-rights organization (FERAL), we can see the consequences of that action. The injury is described in horrific detail. The cases for and against hunting are presented, as well as the issues affecting the animial-rights movement. Spencer's life with his disability is made real by the heart-wrenching scenes where he tries to make do with one arm. I thought the characters were well-developed and while not all were very likeable, all were understandable. Even the little baby, Patrick, was a real person and someone I could enjoy. When I read something like this, it shows me why I will never be a writer. I liked the way it ended with (I won't give anything away here) something that the grandmother had mentioned to Charlotte and her cousin during the summer. I liked the descriptions. It had to have taken a lot of thought and a lot of research to create a book like this, and the efforts were evident on every page. ...more A character study, requires a patient reading (well, listening in my case) that allows the plot to develop while gaining a fairly deep understanding of each member of the Seton clan.

The relationships are simple on their face, complicated by the very passions and character traits that are prized by their owners. The exploration of how individuals associate ideas together, especially between parents and children, was interesting. The underutilized relationships of adult siblings, and how their spouses become friends and true family over the years, is also a part of the story, often reflecting how our siblings see traits and habits that we ignore or don't see in ourselves. As one of forty plus first cousins, it was great to read about how the cousins in this story fed off each other, pushed at each other, and experienced their relationship with their shared grandmother. Though I think the plot was tied up a bit too neatly, I did appreciate considering how these relationships might evolve over the years, with a bit of gratitude that this disaster would allow a different appreciation of each other. ...more I read this book because my friend Heidi recommended it.

Throw in strict over the top veganism,(FERAL was depicted as a cutthroat group and I do like animals), gun control, the mandatory New York mention of 911, and class awareness and you have a good read. Spencer's convalescence was a nightmare even in someone as motivated as he. The dreams about the crabs partially explained his veganism but not his obsessions to the detriment of his family with the rights of animals. I was glad to see the changes that occurred in him by the end of the book. ...more Having been a huge fan of all Bohjalian's previous books, Before You Know Kindness was at the top of my list to read when it came out. Taking on vegetarians, vegans and gun control, this book tackels a lot of topics and does so with finess.

What I enjoyed about the book was that Bohjalian did not clearly make a stance on whether he thought hunting was wrong, or that people should not eat meat. Although, it was obvious that gun control, and learning how to properly care for a gun was foremost in his mind. Overall, another great book by Bohjalian! I enjoyed the characters and their development. I especially enjoyed the ending which was well worth the wait and truly made the entire book for me. If you're new to his writing- I think once you read this you'll do what I did and devour his entire catalogue! Happy Reading! ...more Wouldn't you know I'd choose the Bohjalian that reviewers here and on Amazon say is his weakest. I think there just wasn't enough here for a 413 p. book.

It is also anti-hunting, including deer which are decimating the family garden. It is the shooting of a deer which leads to our story line which I don't want to reveal. But ultimately, this is the story of 2 families, 1 in particular is on the brink of coming apart. 300 p. probably would have been enough to tell their story. ...more This is the book I knew Bohjalian had written.

Like his most famous book, Midwives, this one concerns a single tragic incident (here the shooting of a father by his own daughter), and then builds a story around the question of intent (did the daughter shoot her father accidentally or did she knowingly pull the trigger?).

Like his most famous book, Midwives, this one concerns a single tragic incident (here the shooting of a father by his own daughter), and then builds a story around the question of intent (did the daughter shoot her father accidentally or did she knowingly pull the trigger?). The question is never definitively answered, but the way each character in the book decides to view the situation affects their interactions with everyone else, and crucial decisions they make about each other and their own futures. Unlike Midwives and some of Bohjalian's other novels (Trans-Sister Radio and Buffalo Soldier, for example), I didn't find this one as compelling. I found the behavior of the daughter - while perhaps realisitc - incredibly annoying as she attempts to hide crucial information about the night of the shooting. The father is also a vegan animal rights activist who is portrayed as a borderline psychotic because of his beliefs - which don't actually seem all that crazy. So much of what threatens to tear the family apart post-shooting seems focused on this group he belongs to. While I appreciate a story that points out the ills of working too hard at the expense of one's home life - I thought the negative treatment of vegetarianism and veganism in the book completely odd. Perhaps this is a result of living in a part of the country where non-meat-eaters are basically mainstream, but I just didn't see it as creating as much conflict in life as this man's choices seemed to. I feel like most of Bohjalian's books could serve as excellent springboards for discussions among high school students about the difference between right and wrong, and all the gray areas in between. This one is definitely no different, but certainly not as complex or riveting as others he has written. ...more ****Spoiler Alert****** This book is about a family and how they react to an accidental shooting.

However, it doesn\u2019t really take away from how talented this writer is. I was slightly disappointed in the fact that I didn\u2019t seem to like any of the characters. Caroline is a flirt and seems more interested in her life than she is in being a mom. Sara is a psychologist and therefore you would think she would have played a bigger role in resolving the family conflict, but she doesn\u2019t. It may be because she has to tend to her infant son. I didn\u2019t dislike John, I felt more pity than anything else. Willow was probably one of the more likeable characters, however, I kept waiting for her to get enough nerve to come out and tell someone the truth about what was going on. I detested Charlotte. I thought she was a spoiled little brat, although typical teenager. And finally, Spencer\u2026.I thought he was more likeable after the accident than before. I think he started to realize how important his family was to him as opposed to his obsession with his work. I thought there was a ton of great information in this book about a variety of subjects like animal rights, guns, gardening, being a vegan or vegetarian. The author did a good job showing both sides of each issue instead of trying to push an agenda. This is the first Bohjalian book I have read and it won\u2019t be my last.

Also involved in the story are Spencer's wife's brother and his family, who have their own problems to sort through. I enjoyed reading about the families' different ways of dealing with the tragedy and watching Spencer relax his hardline stance after his injury. I did feel that the animal rights activists portrayed in the book were dealt with a bit unfairly. I suppose that Bohjalian was trying to focus on extremists rather than those with more moderate views. But as a vegetarian who avoids wearing leather, I found it a bit annoying how often he mentioned that non-leather items were unattractive or clunky. In almost any shoe store you can find many styles of non-leather shoes, and it can be quite difficult to tell which are real and which are fake without feeling or smelling the shoes. So seriously, come on. Also, the several mentions of how animal rights activist characters found themselves more sympathetic to animals than to human beings grated, too. Actually, I think that some extreme animal rights activists probably do feel that way, but I also think it's unlikely that even the most extreme animal activist cares more for animals than for his or her own family members. I enjoyed discussing the book with Mom's book group at the Lynchburg Public Library in March.

He has managed to alienate all the people around him who care about him, and he is totally oblivious. But when Spencer is shot with a deer rifle in a tragic accident, the narrative follows the events leading up to the shooting; then we find out how the shooting affects everyone else in the family, including Spencer's in-laws. I almost gave up on the book because it took a while to get into it & figure out the who's who list of characters. But because the author was Chris Bohjalian, I stuck with it, since I've liked other books he has written. I got a little bogged down with the other FERAL member characters & some of the legal aspects that were covered in the story, but I did like the Seton & McCollough families. This boils down to figuring out what's important in our lives and what we need to do so we don't lose them forever. ...more This big fan of Bohjalian's Trans Sister Radio was not a big fan of this novel.

No luck there. I have a vegan cousin,who wants to be a bee keeper in Maine and starts everyday with a soy-rific smoothie. Nope, Spencer the FERAL activist, didn't grab me either. I like teenagers,and teach seventh grade, but Willow and Charlotte, the 11 and 13 year old girls were rather flat and dry. My family disagrees with each other on an issue or two, but the Seton/McCullough debate over \"to meat, or not to meat\" didn't do it for me. Lastly, I thought I would really like Nan, as I too spend the summers with my grandmother, but we never really learn her story either. So, maybe the characters were too flat, too pretentious, too independently wealthy, or perhaps just too boring.

Sara and Willow seemed a bit too good for me, like they were there to be microscopes more than characters. I was engrossed by the Seton family, especially Spencer, Charlotte, and Nan. Spencer is my argumentative side, the one who would ask God for a sign, see a hand come from the heavens pointing down, and then ask what the hell that means. Charlotte was a good kid with the wrong choice at the wrong moment. Nan I wish had been explored more. Especially the scene in which she asks her son about her work and is relieved to avoid the intimacy. Aren't we all like that? Don't we all let routine and activity replace intimacy? Overally, I liked it but I wanted more. I especially should not have read this after Ehrenreich, because I kept asking myself why the author didn't have the nerve to make money an issue. Because Americans don't like taking on class, even in the safe world of fiction. ...more This book started off strong - Bohjalian is a great story teller and develops his characters so that you recognize them as people you might know. The very first scene gives you the crux of the story - a man has been shot by his 13 year old daughter while on vacation in New Hampshire. Then the first half of the book brings you to a few days prior to set up the scene and show you the different relationships and to give you a hint that everything might not be an accident.

The very first scene gives you the crux of the story - a man has been shot by his 13 year old daughter while on vacation in New Hampshire. Then the first half of the book brings you to a few days prior to set up the scene and show you the different relationships and to give you a hint that everything might not be an accident. But then...the book changes course and starts to focus on the lawsuit against a faceless gun company and that hint of intrigue is completely lost. What little suspense there is in the book is basically centered around whether or not the injured man will go forward with a press conference. Not really the gripping conflict that I was hoping for. ...more As in his earlier books \"The Law of Similars\" and \"Buffalo Soldier,\" Chris Bohjalian creates characters struggling to remain standing and move forward under the blows life deals us randomly or otherwise. We emphathize with these intelligent, well meaning people who bicker, love, drift apart, and try to figure out how to create or sustain the conections to each other that enable us to withstand those blows. Each character is believable and all too human, and the author really creates credible chi As in his earlier books \"The Law of Similars\" and \"Buffalo Soldier,\" Chris Bohjalian creates characters struggling to remain standing and move forward under the blows life deals us randomly or otherwise. We emphathize with these intelligent, well meaning people who bicker, love, drift apart, and try to figure out how to create or sustain the conections to each other that enable us to withstand those blows. Each character is believable and all too human, and the author really creates credible children and teenagers. In this book a family must come to terms with a tragic event and its impact on the person causing the event, the person horribly affected by the event, and all family members and their connections to each other. An interesting book worth reading (as is the poem from which the title takes its name)! ...more I liked this book quite a bit better than the last Bohjalian novel I read (Night Strangers). As vegetarian I found the focus on an animal rights activist and his family very interesting. My biggest annoyance about it was that when he was referring to any of the child characters (especially the two girls), or having one of the adults think about the child characters, he often used \"the child\" or \"the girl\", etc. Perhaps he's done this with other books and I just haven't noticed, but it really sto I liked this book quite a bit better than the last Bohjalian novel I read (Night Strangers).

But obviously not enough to keep me from reading it :) ...more Some of the other reviews of this book said it is slow moving. Yes, I will agree with that but it's not meant to be a page turning thriller. You get to know each character as the story unfolds slowly and along with each character the author does a very good job of painting a good picture of the surroundings. I have a vision even now of the Seton house and grounds as well as the other locations in the book. Without giving anything away, I will simply say that I am glad I stuck with the book and f Some of the other reviews of this book said it is slow moving.

It was my third Chris Bohjalian book and I have not been disappointed yet....on to \"Midwives\". ...more I liked the book overall. That said, I felt the book's length didn't really need to be so long. Kind of like being in a movie you wished had ended a half-hour ago. At times the whole militantly anti-gun, animal rights over human rights, self-righteous vegan stuff got to be a bit much - OK, you can quit preaching at me. I began to wonder if Bohjalian was vegan and wanted to get a point across and was I maybe supposed to feel even a little guilty for earing a turkey sandwich while listening to the I liked the book overall.

NOPE! ...more I gave it more pages than it deserved!!!! I guess the Prologue got me hooked to see how the shooting happen, but getting there was torture. This was worst writing I seen.... oh my god the author would have run on forever adjectives to explain things that were painful to read. I mean I love when someone can paint a picture for you but come on I am not stupid and have no imagination of my own. Maybe needs a course in how not to write creativity. I really enjoyed this book. Some reviews say that it develops too slowly but I enjoyed the slow development of the characters and the story. Until the end, I couldn't decide how it was going to turn out. It was interesting to read the internal struggles that the various characters went through after the accident. I'm glad that Charlotte told the truth in the end.<---C>Chris Bohjalian</---C>", "Title": "Before You Know Kindness"},
