When I first moved in, she had just broken up with her white boyfriend. \u201cIt never would have worked out anyway\u2026\u201d she had cried. By the end of that same year she was flying of to Houston to be wed to a man she had only seen once, a marriage arranged by their parents. Many nights my other roommate (an exchange student from Berlin) and I would sit out on the balcony smoking cigarettes and marveling at the concept of an arranged marriage in the new millennium. This book made me understand her a little bit better, her choice in marriage and other aspects of our briefly shared lives, like: her putting palm oil in her hair, the massive Dutch oven that was constantly blowing steam, or her mother living with us for 3 months. This is after all the story of an Indian growing up American and the cultural adaptations and clashes that color his life. Perspective shifting from parent to child and back again, it\u2019s an engaging view of an immigrant family in America. Gogol hates his name, and the Bengali traditions that are forced on him since childhood. The reader follows him through adolescence into adulthood where his history and his family affect his relationships with women more than anything else.

Anyone who has ever been ashamed of their parents, felt the guilty pull of duty, questioned their own identity, or fallen in love, will identify with these intermingling lives.

Skimming over the mundane, she punctuates the cherished memories and life changing events that are now somewhat hazy.<---F> It is a superb first novel</---F>. ...more In 2000, <---A>Jhumpa Lahiri</---A> won the Pulitzer Prize for her story collection Interpreter of Maladies, becoming the first Indian to win the award.

Ashoke and Ashmina Ganguli, recentl In 2000, Jhumpa Lahiri won the Pulitzer Prize for her story collection Interpreter of Maladies, becoming the first Indian to win the award. In the last story, an engineering graduate student arrives in Cambridge from Calcutta, starting a life in a new country. This story is the basis for <+++>The Namesake</+++>, Lahiri's first full length novel where she weaves together elements from her own life to paint a picture of the Indian immigrant experience in the United States. Ashoke and Ashmina Ganguli, recently wed in an arranged marriage, have immigrated to Boston from Calcutta so that Ashoke can pursue a PhD in engineering. A world away from their Bengali family and friends and in the days before the Internet, their only means of communication was aero grams. Ashmina is immediately homesick for India so she founds a network of Bengalis up and down the east coast, preserving traditions and creating a pseudo-family in her new country. With her husband learning and teaching, these friends are a reminder of home for her, and, as a result, she never fully assimilates into American society. Within the first year of the Gangulis arrival, Ashmina becomes pregnant with the couple's first child. Adhering to Bengali tradition, Ashmina's grandmother is supposed to name the baby, but her letter never arrives. Ashoke contemplates and comes up with the only name he can think of: Gogol, after the Russian writer, whose volume of short stories saved his life during a fatal train derailment in India. Both Ashoke and Ashmina desire that Gogol have a Bengali life in America despite being one of few Indian families in their area. Gogol and his younger sister Sonali grow up fully assimilated as Americans. They barely speak Bengali and only once in awhile crave Indian food. Both choose career paths that are not traditionally Indian so that they have little contact with the Bengali culture that their parents fought so hard to preserve. Lahiri even creates a character based on her own immigrant experiences who desires an identity different than Bengali or American and seeks a doctorate in French literature. Based in Brooklyn and Paris, this woman resembles Lahiri as she learned to speak Italian and lived in Rome for a number of years. Lahiri and her character sought to remake themselves in order to distance themselves from the Bengali culture that their parents forced upon them as children. As in Interpreter of Maladies, Jhumpa Lahiri paints a rich picture of the Indian immigrant experience in the United States. Using short sentences with rich prose, the story moves quickly as we follow the Ganguli family for thirty five years of their lives. Being an immigrant turns into a unique experience for each character, yet the story centers around Gogol as he moves from Indian American child to American Indian adult. With a novel rich in subplots and provocative issues of the day, Jhumpa Lahiri is quickly becoming a leading voice in literary fiction and a favorite author of mine. I look forward to the other rich novels that Lahiri has in store, and rate The Namesake 4.5 bright stars. ...more \"He hates that his name is both absurd and obscure, that it has nothing to do with who he is, that it is neither Indian nor American but of all things Russian.

Jhumpa Lahiri crafts a novel full of introspection and quiet emotion as she tells the story of the immigrant experience of one Bengali family, the Gangulis. Following an arranged marriage, Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli move to America to begin a new life in Cambridge, Massachusetts. While Ashoke has the distraction of a professional career, Ashima feels lost and adrift without family, friends, and the comfort of familiar surroundings. In fact, Ashima will spend decades trying to make a life for herself, trying to fit into a culture that is so alien to the one she has left behind. Upon the birth of her first child, Ashima feels so utterly alone without family by her side to support her and welcome this new baby. \"As she strokes and suckles and studies her son, she can\u2019t help but pity him. She has never known of a person entering the world so alone, so deprived.\" Thus begins Gogol\u2019s life and his pursuit towards understanding and establishing his own identity as a first generation American born to Indian immigrants. Named after Russian writer Nikolai Gogol, our developing protagonist will scorn not only his name but also his parent\u2019s traditions, their quiet ways, their trips to Calcutta to visit family, and their \u201cadopted\u201d Bengali family in America \u2013 those friends with similar immigrant experiences to their own. Instead, he yearns to shed his namesake, one that holds special significance in his father\u2019s life for reasons that have yet to be revealed to Gogol himself. I have to wonder if Gogol had earlier learned the extraordinary meaning of this name to his father\u2019s own personal experience, then perhaps Gogol\u2019s approach towards life would have been different. But, in a sense this is a coming of age story for Gogol and perhaps the timing would not have mattered so much as his own maturing and growth. We see Gogol and his sister Sonia embracing American ways \u2013 eating Thanksgiving turkeys, preparing for Santa Claus, and coloring Easter eggs \u2013 while Ashoke and Ashima continue to expose them to the Bengali customs and celebrations. Once Gogol sets off for college, he attempts to leave behind much of his parent\u2019s influence as well as his name. But in changing a name can a young man really erase his heritage and begin a life ignoring the expectations of his parents, the imprint of their culture? Isn\u2019t this a part of him, just as much as are the American ways and customs? Does he truly need to put aside one way of life in order to find complete happiness in another? Through a series of relationships and life events, Gogol does transform over time, or so I believe, but not without his share of trials and heartache. Jhumpa Lahiri has a gift for penetrating the psyche of each of her characters. It seems there is always something a reader can relate to in each of them, in one way or another \u2013 whether likeable or not. Each character is flawed just as every human being is imperfect. I don\u2019t think that one needs to understand the immigrant experience to connect with this book. The Namesake is completely relatable to anyone that has ever strived to fit in, to find an identity, to accept those around us for what they are, not what we think they should be. \"Things that should never have happened, that seemed out of place and wrong, these were what prevailed, what endured, in the end.\" ...more Jhumpa Lahiri's excellent mastery and command of language are amazing.

Just look at one of my favorite passages - so simple and beautiful: \" Try to remember it always,\" he said once Gogol had reached him, leading him slowly back across the breakwater, to where his mother and Sonia stood waiting. \"Remember that you and I made this journey together to a place where there was nowhere left to go. \" No wonder it took me quite a few days after finishing this book to finally surface from under the charm of her language before I was able to figure out what exactly kept nagging me about The Namesake . You see, The Namesake flows so well that it almost easy to overlook the weak plot development and the unfortunate wasting of so much potential that this story could have had. After finishing it, I had the pleasant 'warm & fuzzy' nostalgic feeling - and yet almost immediately the narrative itself began to fade in my mind, and it became hard to remember what exactly happened over the three hundred pages. In a nutshell, this is a story about the immigrant experience. Ashoke and Ashima are first-generation immigrants to the US from India, and they do not have the easiest time adjusting to the peculiarities of their new home and its culture. Gogol, the protagonist, is their son who is tasked with living the double life, so to speak - fitting in with the culture of his parents as well as the culture of his family's new country. Simultaneously experiencing two cultures is not always easy, and this is the main theme of this book. And these were the bits of the story that I could relate to in a way, being a first-generation immigrant myself. \" For being a foreigner Ashima is beginning to realize, is a sort of lifelong pregnancy -- a perpetual wait, a constant burden, a continuous feeling out of sorts. It is an ongoing responsibility, a parenthesis in what had once been an ordinary life, only to discover that previous life has vanished, replaced by something more complicated and demanding. Like pregnancy, being a foreigner, Ashima believes, is something that elicits the same curiosity of from strangers, the same combination of pity and respect. \" The Namesake is titled so because Gogol is named after a famous Russian writer Nikolai Gogol (the reason I picked up this book, by the way. Nikolai Gogol is a great writer). Famous namesake or not, young Gogol dislikes his unusual moniker quite a bit. This is a set-up for the conflict, which, unfortunately, I felt was quite underdeveloped. You see, Lahiri takes a subtle approach without the need to hit the reader over the head with her message. The story she tells is lifelike - calm, subdued, without extra glamour added to it, without every set-up resulting in a major conflict. But I feel that this subtlety quite often crosses the line into the lull of dullness. The story becomes almost like a diary - with much everyday filler, many simple events, many instances of telling and not showing , and not enough payoff - at least for me. Apparently I love quick gratifications, and this book did not deliver those. I want to reiterate that my issues with this book were very easy (even for me) to initially disregard because of the beauty and near perfection of Lahiri writing style which makes up for many flaws. But ultimately I felt unsatisfied with the story, and therefore I can only give it 3.5 stars. That said, I already bought two other books by Lahiri and will definitely read them. She seems to be a brilliant writer, and maybe will prove to be a better storyteller in her other works. ...more Look. I admit it. I read for escapist purposes.

I do not read to have my reality handed back to me on more mundane terms than I myself could create on two hours of sleep and a monstrosity of a hangover. The good things about this book? It's readable. Very readable. Very punctual use of commas, and paragraph indentations, and general story flow. And by reading it from cover to cover, I have discovered a pet peeve of mine that I hadn't realized I had been liable to, but now fully acknowledge as part and parcel of my readerly sensibilities. Fortunate for me, not so fortunate for the book. Show, not tell. Perhaps you've heard the phrase, over and over and over to a nauseatingly horrific extent without any additional information as to how exactly to go about accomplishing this mantra. There's a multitude of reasons for following this niftily short doctrine, and one of them is fully encompassed by this novel here, with its unholy engorgement on lists. If a scene pops up, lists of the surroundings. If an action is participated in, lists of all the objects involved, with as prolific a number of brand names as possible. If a character is introduced, well, the only way to go about it is to list of their clothing, their rote physical attributes, their major, their job, their personal history as far as is encompassed by a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or Facebook page. Minimal amounts of creative flights, barely a metaphor in sight, and as for deeply resonant emotional delving into the personas meandering the page, down to the very blood and bones of their recognizable humanity? Nadda. I wish I was joking when I said that, had Lahiri not been allowed to pad her story with all these long strings of descriptive sentences that were nothing more than another entry in the same old, same old, you'd be left with fifty pages. If that. The end result was a feeling of being able to read this story quickly, yes, but through a thick layer of cellophane that left in its wake singular feelings of why am I bothering and its good old pal, am I supposed to care? There's another piece of terminology that writing classes love to throw around in addition to that previous standard, and that's voice. If there was a voice in this novel, it was drowned by the endless streams of banal information attached to every inch of the plot's surface, leaving me with the slightly ill sense of watching the consumerism train wreck of typical American society without any reassurance that the author knew what they were doing. Also, the almost constant adherence to stereotypes of Indians who immigrate to America as the engineering->Ivy League->repeat, along with every other gender/familial/socioeconomic stereotype known to humanity? Considering the fact that one of my biggest reasons for reading as much as I do is to find a breakdown of these popular culture standards, I was rather disappointed. Scratch that, I was very disappointed, enough to muse on whether this book, published all of nine years ago, had helped propagate those stereotypes in the first place. Dark thoughts indeed. Finally, the literature title dropping. I suppose I should've expected it, what with the main character's name issues taking up the entirety of the novel's effort when it came to both theme and its own title, but by the end of it I was sick of seeing all those highflown phrases without a single scrip of fictional push on the author's part to live up to these influences. Borrow a few methods of making your prose fly off the page in a churning maelstrom of creating your own beautiful song out of the best the written word has to offer? Fine, dandy, go forth and prosper. Shoving in 'The Man Without Qualities' and Proust within the last few pages in some obtuse attempt to impress those who are in the know? Hipster, and I mean that with a vengeance. So, simply put, if you're looking to recommend me South Asian literature, please oh please grant me a work along the lines of The God of Small Things . Cultural intersection between self and others without relying on the obvious and the physical objects? Check. Characters that broke my heart over and over with their joy and their sorrow that I wish I could follow forevermore? Check. Voice? Just. You'd have to read it. It even has a literature reference, albeit in a way that pays full tribute to the work far beyond the facile typing of its signifying phrase and nothing more. This? Not so much. ...more Enjoyed reading about the Bengali culture, their traditions, envied their sense and closeness of family.

Eventually the family meets other Bengalis and they become family substitutes, celebrate important cultural milestones together. This novel gave me a new understanding of just how hard it is to assimilate into a new culture. The first half of the book I remained emotionally unconnected to the characters, felt it was more tell than show. This changed after a family tragedy which afforded an opportunity for the characters to change as well. Was impatient with Gogol and his failure to appreciate everything about his parents, his own culture but he grows within the story as does his mother. So I ended up appreciating this book quite a bit as a cultural story and a family story. Very glad I finally read it. Auto correct hates these names by the way, had to go back and change them three times already. ...more I thought of a better title! An Indian Family Moves To America And Proceeds To Live .

The story lacks purpose, drive and offers up the tiniest morsel of tension. Certainly life-changing moments occur for the Ganguli family, but the reader is never given that certain something needed to give an honest shit. I really thought I was going to love this. It's got the epic immigrant story, I like learning about other cultures, much of it is set in Boston and it name-drops some of my favorite locales (hello Brattle Theater!), but it's about as interesting as flipping through a stranger's photo album. I'm sure some asshole will come along and tell me I'm a provincial-minded lout who doesn't understand some archaic Bengali literary tradition from which The Namesake has been stylized, but I don't care. This kind of book doesn't move me. Me, that's the operative word there. For all that, I still enjoyed reading this. I mean literally, I enjoyed how Lahiri put one word after another. They were nicely arranged! She's clearly a talented writer. Her scenes and characters are so well-crafted they feel reach-out-and-touch-them real! In many instances through out the book I became entranced by the imagery, lost in the luxuriously decorated background, but then I'd notice the principle players at center stage speaking their lines so eloquently, yet without purpose. I felt like I was watching people walk through life and that annoyed me. When I read a book, watch a play or a movie I expect to see something more than everyday life. I can get plenty of that at home! ...more I liked the first 40 pages or so. I was very interested in the scenes in India and the way the characters perceived the U.S. after they moved. But soon I found myself losing interest. There were several problems. One is that Lahiri's novelistic style feels more like summary (\"this happened, then this, then this\") rather than a story I can experience through scenes. The voice was flat, and this was exacerbated by the fact that it's written in present tense. I never emotionally connected to these I liked the first 40 pages or so.

Immigrant anguish - the toll it takes in settling in an alien country after having bidden adieu to one\u2019s home, family, and culture is what this prize-winning novel is supposed to explore, but it's no more than a superficial complaint about a few signature \u2013 and done to death - South Asian issues relating to marriage and paternal expectations: a clich\u00e9d immigrant story, I'm afraid to say. Gogol\u2019s life, and that of every person related to him in any way, from the day of his birth to his divorce at 30, is documented in a long monotone, like a camera trained on a still scene, without zooming in and out, recording every movement the lens catches, accidentally. A final picture emerges in which nothing in particular stands out; and twists that could have been explored more deeply, on a philosophical and humanistic level, such as Gogol\u2019s disillusionment with his dual identity or the aftermath of (Gogol\u2019s father) Ashoke\u2019s death are touched upon perfunctorily or rushed through. Some cultural comparisons are made as though to validate the enlightened United States at the cost of backward India. This is a familiar line in immigrant success stories: to justify their decision to migrate to the West by heaping scorn on the country or culture of their origin. But even that's not done intelligently. E.g; Maxine\u2019s mother wears swimsuit on the lakeside; Gogol thinks his mother would never do that. Maxine\u2019s parents don\u2019t bother when Gogol moves into their house and have sex with Maxine; Gogol's parents would have been horrified! It is almost in these words the comparisons are made. Well, of course. We get it. However, on the bright side, I liked the trope of public vs private names \u2013 Nikhil aka Gogol - and how Lahiri relates this private, accidental double-naming to the protagonist's larger identity crisis as an American and Indian immigrant. But, again, it's also wasted; it doesn't stand out; nothing catches your fancy; nothing piques your interest; and you sit with a little impatience welling up inside you. You just sit there, squinting your eyes, making faces at the text, wondering...Pulitzer? Are you kidding me? February 2015 ...more Such a great book. My second book by Lahiri and it did not disappoint. Her writing is beautiful and lyrical. I did see this movie many times as it is a favorite. Even though I know the story, the book seemed new to me. The audio version was so easy to listen to. I an fascinated by Indian culture and love reading about it. I can see myself reading this one over and over again and will be watching the movie again very soon. This book tells a story which must be familiar to anyone who has migrated to another country - the fact that having made the transition to a new culture you are left missing the old and never quite achieving full admittance into the new.

The story follows their lives for 32 years from when Ashima is pregnant and facing delivering her first child the American way without the comfort of her extended Indian family and all their social customs to help her. Lahiri writes beautifully and the book is a pleasure to read. She also sees right to the heart of the issues of migrant families, from the mother who never adapts fully to the children who try to cast off their roots but find it very difficult to do. My only issue was with the way the narrative rambles on, often about very insignificant issues yet passing too quickly over more important events. It was very well written rambling of course but my mind did occasionally wander away from the book. Despite this, this is a beautiful book which tells a very important story and is well worth reading. ...more It would only be fair to mention here that I saw Mira Nair's adaptation of the book before I actually got down to reading this novel recently.

First, I feel this is one of the few times when the film more than does justice to the book and second, that the book itself is a deeply involving and affecting experience. In fact, so compassionate and compelling is the writer's understanding of her characters and their complexes, that the novel stays uniformly engaging till the very last page. Also, it helps that this is an extremely easy read and I for one, found myself going through it at a ravenous pace. As a reader, one gets instantly drawn into the lives of young Ashima and Ashoke, who are a bundle of nerves in an alien country, far from adoring relatives and friends in Calcutta. The writer's description of how the couple grapples with the ways of a new world yet tightly holding on to their roots is deeply moving and rings true at every point. When a letter from their grandmother in India, enclosing the name for their first born doesn't arrive in time, Ashoke instinctively and naively (as their son says later in life) names him Gogol- a name, derived from the Russian author, Nikolai Gogol, with whom the latter feels a deep connection. The name comes to embarrass their son as he grows older and is a reminder of his confused being -it's not even a proper Bengali name, he protests! Gogol's agony is not so much about being born to Indian parents, as much as being saddled with a name that seems to convey nothing, in a way accentuating his feeling of \"not really belonging to anything\" After much internal struggle, he changes his name to a more acceptable Indian name, Nikhil and feels it would enable him to face the world more confidently. But for me personally, the best part of the novel was Gogol's marriage to his childhood family friend Maushami Muzumdar. The latter is far from a conventional Bengali girl and Gogol is attracted to her individualistic streak and high living. In many ways, Maushami bridges a certain important gap in his mind and presents to him the best of both worlds --- she's Bengali like him, so in a strange way that's a comforting feeling. At the same time, she displays the same excessive, broadminded living of the Americans. However, the fact that this relationship collapses and leaves no mark in their individual lives whatsoever, is also a telling statement about how, ultimately, coming from a similar background provides no guarantee for marital success. On the other hand, his sister Sonia's marriage to an American proves to be quite blissful.

Nobody else in the book does anything. 4. The novelist exoticizes her own cultural background for no apparent end. 5. The book is written in that summary style some writers have, where this happens, then that happens, the she tells him this and he says that (the 3rd person omniscient narrator tells us), and they go to a restaurant, and nine months pass while they travel to Calcutta (spanning all of four pages), and then they graduate college, and then they have Christmas dinner, and a party, and then they sleep with someone for the first time, and then they think about it for five minutes and return to Yale for final exams, and then they sleep with someone else, and then they think about their father, and so on. As you can tell, I'm not a fan of this writing style. Studying screenwriting for 10 years has made me realize the enormous value of scenes and dialogue. Oh yeah, and plot. 5. If I were to write a parody of this book drawing upon my own ethnic background, it would read something like this: \"They broke open the warm rolls, uncorked the Asti Spumanti. Ate the linguini with clam sauce and pasta fagiole and antipasto with prosciutto and green pepper. Later, had cold salami sandwiches and the remnants of a pepper and egg grinder with oil and vinegar. After they made love, they smoked a couple of Marlborough Lights and ordered a Hawaiian pizza and two plastic-wrapped cups of tiramisu.\" The entire book reads like this. It's little more than a grocery list. STAY AWAY. Okay, I guess I skewered it after all. ...more So an Idaho School District is considering the possibility of banning The Namesake from their high schools reading list. I don't know about other parents, but I trust that my kids are not going to read this beautiful novel and somehow plunge into a life of drug abuse...

Ashoke is a professor in the United States and takes his bride to this foreign country where they try to assimilate into American life, while still maintaining their distinctly Bengali identities. When their first child is born, a son, they are awaiting a letter from Ashima\u2019s grandmother telling them his name, which she is to have selected. In the absence of the letter, and at the insistence of the American hospital, they select what is meant to be a temporary name. The name of Ashoke\u2019s favorite author, the Russian Gogol. There is a great significance in Ashoke\u2019s selection of this name for his son, but Gogol does not know this. All he knows as he grows older is that he has a name that is strange and cumbersome and unwieldy and that he wants a name that blends and reflects his world, not the world of Bengal but the world of America. His name becomes, for him, evidence of his not belonging. Against this backdrop, Lahiri examines the immigrant experience of the Gangulis, the confusion and difficulties faced by the first generation Americans who are their children, and the delicate ties that bind the generations to each other and to the culture they have left behind. As we watch Gogol progress through his life, there is much that we understand from our own experience and much that is unique to his experience alone. In the end, I found this book was about expectations. The expectations parents have for their children, the expectations we have for ourselves, the need to live up to a criteria we sometimes do not understand or come to understand far too late, and the loneliness of each individual, even within the confines of a loving family. By any standard, this book would be quite an accomplishment. As a first novel, this book is amazing. I have Lahiri\u2019s Interpreter of Maladies on my shelf and I am now anxious to get to it. She is destined to be an important voice in literature. ...more Lahiri\u2019s Interpreter of Maladies was a collection I admired more than I enjoyed, so I\u2019m sorry to say I was apprehensive about reading her first full-length novel\u2014but happy to report that it was an absolutely great experience.

Junot Diaz, Julia Alvarez, Anzia Yezierska, and Edwidge Danticat are just a few of the authors who have told their own versions. The story they all have in common: The immigrant experience in the United States. Each of the above authors tackles this subject from a different enthnographic perspective, but the pull between the old (native) culture and the new (immigrant) one is always present. Pulitzer prize winning author Jhumpa Lahiri adds to this conversation with \"The Namesake\" (her first novel which was a follow up to her short story collection \"Interpreter of Maladies\" which won the Pulitzer): the epic story of the Ganguli family's arrival and assimilation into the world of the United States. The story begins when Ashoke and his wife (of an arranged marriage), Ashima, come to Massachusetts where Ashoke is a graduate student at MIT. The year is 1968. At the beginning of the novel Ashima is pregnant with her first child, a son. In Bengali culture, it is common for people to have a formal name and a pet name (nickname). Ashoke has no problem coming up with a nickname for their son: Gogol. Unfortunately, due to a variety of mishaps and misunderstandings, the formal name proves harder to settle on and even harder to enforce. So Gogol Ganguli grows up with only a pet name--one that is not American, or Indian, or a first name. No one really cares that Gogol's name is so unique, except Gogol whose anxiety over his name is bothersome enough that no external taunts are necessary. Gogol eventually resolves to rename himself, but not after learning the life-changing story that inspired his father give Gogol his name in the first place. Despite the vast period Lahiri writes about, the novel's focus remains narrowly focused on the characters, especially Ashima and her son. Despite the authenticity that Lahiri brings to her main characters, certain scenes remain naggingly artificial--feeling simultaneously improbable and contrived. Lahiri's writing here (I've yet to read her short stories) is beautiful without being pretentious or overly self-aware. The story feels authentic and compelling despite the fact that so many of the cultural references remain worlds away. Even more interesting is the fact that I enjoyed almost the entire novel despite having a strong dislike of Gogol and several of the secondary characters. (I'd say more about what this means in terms of the writing style/skill but I still haven't figured out how that happened.) Despite my misgivings throughout the novel, Gogol does work toward redeeming himself by the end of the story. Regardless of my nitpicks, \"The Namesake\" remains a must for anyone interested in the immigrant experience in America. Lahiri's narrative hearkens back to Jeffrey Eugenides' \"Middlesex\" which has a similar scope, tracing three generation's relationship with Detroit. \"The Namesake\" deals with common themes but, as any good book should, Lahiri makes these subjects new and original with her unique characters and wonderful writing. ...more This appears to be written specifically for Western readers with no knowledge of Indian culture. You know, a commercial, populist work aimed to give you a flavor of India, shock you with arranged marriages, Indian family dynamics, struggles of Indian immigrants, etc., which at the same time gives you no real insight into the foreign mentality that isn't superficial or obvious. Nothing new for me here. I say read In Other Rooms, Other Wonders instead if you are looking for something less trite. No second thought at all: this book is well-written. It has all the elements of a good novel: tight intriguing plot, show don't tell, memorable characters that you can't help but empathize with and it teaches us a thing or two about being marginalized if not discriminated or alienated because we are different from most of the people we find ourselves with.

It has all the elements of a good novel: tight intriguing plot, show don't tell, memorable characters that you can't help but empathize with and it teaches us a thing or two about being marginalized if not discriminated or alienated because we are different from most of the people we find ourselves with. I am living in the country where I was born but I have two siblings who are now living in the West (older brother in California and older sister in Winnipeg) and I have heard sorry stories about their struggles to fit in when they were starting to live in those far foreign countries. My 78-y/o mother is also living alone in a senior's apartment in National City, CA and she's been there for almost twenty years now and there are more Filipinos in that senior's apartment so she says that sometimes she feels that she is still in the Philippines with the TFG (The Filipino Channel) on whenever she is awake and inside her room. I am sure my brother, sister and my mom felt the same way as the couple Ashoke and Ashimi in this first novel by Jhumpa Lahiri (born 1967). Especially since my brother and my sister-in-law have two kids although their first born is called Jonathan (taken from the OT because my brother is deeply religious but not the religious type who quotes biblical verses or maintains a religious blog as a facade to hide an evil lurking inside his sheep's clothing) and not after an Asian writer like Jose Rizal, Haruki Murakami or Mo Yan. In the case of the couple in this book, they named their firstborn Gogol from the Russian writer Nicholai Gogol (1809-1852) because Ashoke was saved from the train accident while reading a book by that author. Lahiri drew inspiration from her own experience as her real name is Nilanjana Sudeshna and when she was in grade school, her teacher just called her \"Jhumpa\" as it was easier to pronounce. Lahiri recalled, \"I always felt so embarrassed by my name.... You feel like you're causing someone pain just by being who you are.\" So, Gogol, the main protagonist in the book refuses to understand the simple reason for his name and denies his heritage as an Bengali and when he grows up he constantly struggles to shed anything Indian in himself to the point of ignoring his family. Contrast is provided by Lahiri in the person of Gogol's younger sister named Sonia as she has an English name thereby breezing through in trying to assimilate with white people. What is in the name? Everything. We use it everyday - in the office we wear our IDs hanging by our necks, our cubicles have our names, our emails have our signatures by default. That's why when my daughter was born, I and my wife really made sure that we chose the best name for her - not too traditional, not old-sounding, not to western but also not after some writers or movie actress. There is almost nothing to dislike about this book. It's just that I did not have any first-hand experience of rearing a child in another country. I had some experiences when I felt discriminated during my trips abroad particularly in the Western countries but they were just some events and did not really humiliated me bigtime. Yet, we don't really need to have similar experiences of our own in order to appreciate good stories, right? Good writing is good writing regardless of whether we could relate to the story or not. ...more This is a diaspora novel; the story of a Bengali family moving to America; the intermingling of cultures, the way different generations adapt and change.

The plot itself is fairly thin and revolves around the main protagonist Gogol Ganguli, his parents (who move to America from India and his various doomed love interests. There are some good food descriptions, and for me that always improves a novel! Lahiri describes cultural alienation rather well; the struggles with dress codes, the tensions between traditional moral values and more modern mores, feeling apart from society, mixing with others in the same situation. Lahiri sometimes switches narrators; this can be illuminating, but she doesn't really do it enough and some alternative points of view would have strengthened the whole. Gogol/nikhil sometimes felt a little flat and more input from the female characters would have made him more three dimensional. It's also about growing up and leaving home; becoming an adult with your parents. There was an emotional warmth and tenderness to this novel which I enjoyed; Lahiri's characters were all likeable in their own way. A simple fable of life, love, growing up and food. Not bad at all. ...more I could write a book about how this book affected me. I am an American Bengali and, for much of my life, I have taken my cultural background for granted, if not lost sight of it completely. \"The Namesake\" takes the little efforts and rituals in my family that I have always thought to be \"weird\", and weaves them into something utterly beautiful. Amazing novel. It was so good to immerse myself in another of Jhumpa Lahiri's books. As with her other novels, I felt totally enrapt with the ebb and flow of her narrative.

As with her other novels, I felt totally enrapt with the ebb and flow of her narrative. Her writing is lyrical and elegant, yet simple and warmly descriptive. The focus of the immigration experience is clearly defined. One can easily sense the feelings of alienation of Lahiri's characters. Despite the attempts to become a part of American society, the older generation clings to their ethnic and national practises and shuns newer experiences, including foods and styles of dress. They do not truly feel part of the society around them. Their circle of friends includes mainly others like them, their compatriots. The offspring of these people viewed themselves as being hostage to many of these ideas and venture away from the family, seeking assimilation. The unusual series of events which have given him his name, cause Gogol, the main character, additional conflicts. Lahiri has clearly developed his feelings and actions as he matures. One can sense his yearning to shed the traditions that have bound his parents. It is easy to view each person as the story evolves. One minor criticism that I have in each of her books is Lahiri's failure to provide some translation for Indian terminology. Although it is possible to gain understanding through the context of the situation, I often wished for a dictionary of this language. Many have stated that they thought this was not as good as Interpreter of Maladies , or Unaccustomed Earth ;but I see it as an excellent example of well fleshed-out prose. It is a richly developed novel which stands alone. ...more \u0641\u0648\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0647! \u062c\u062f\u0627 \u0641\u0648\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0647!

book after watching the movie. The prose is lovely; her descriptions are so personal and detailed that it makes it seem as if you have known these characters all your life. I was completely absorbed in this book and sad when it ended -- I wanted to stay with these characters, see how the rest of their lives turned out. Jhumpa Lahiri is an artist; a literary artist who paints the most beautiful pictures with words, a talented seamstress (yes, I know what seamstress means) who weaves the most intricate, well-woven stories, a Pulitzer-winning goddess who made me feel so many emotions at once. Oh, you wonderful, wonderful woman! *wipes the tears streaming down her face* The Namesake tells the story of two generations of the Ganguli family as they try to live their lives as immigrants in America. It wonderfully cont Jhumpa Lahiri is an artist; a literary artist who paints the most beautiful pictures with words, a talented seamstress (yes, I know what seamstress means) who weaves the most intricate, well-woven stories, a Pulitzer-winning goddess who made me feel so many emotions at once. Oh, you wonderful, wonderful woman! *wipes the tears streaming down her face* The Namesake tells the story of two generations of the Ganguli family as they try to live their lives as immigrants in America. It wonderfully contrasts the views taken by the parents Ashima and Ashoke, and their children Nikhil and Sonali as they learn to live, laugh, and love as Americans. Nikhil, or Gogol, as he is affectionately called by his family is the titular Namesake; named after the famous Russian story-teller Nikolai Gogol considers himself more American than Indian. He leads a kind of a double life; living the quintessential \"American dream\" as Nikhil, the student, the friend, and the lover, while at the same time being a good Bengali son to his parents, as Gogol. Both he and his sister experience a rather jarring cultural shock as the family visits India at some point of time. Having grown up as fast-food eating Americans, they don't much take to traditional Bengali food, nor are the impressed with the hordes of relatives that they are forced to meet. This contrast between the two generations; Ashoke and Ashima, who as Indians find it to difficult to fit in as Americans (there is an instance where Ashima throws out a whole cup of brown rice, because as Bengalis, they eat only white rice), and Gogol and Sonia, who as Americans find it difficult to follow traditional Bengali rituals is beautifully portrayed. The emotions, oh, the myriad of emotions! I cried with Ashima and Ashoke as their parents died (view spoiler) [, and with Ashima and her children when Ashoke died. I was happy for Gogol as he fell in love with, well everyone that he fell in love with, and I wanted to kill Moushmi after she broke Gogol's heart (hide spoiler) ] . Jhumpa Lahiri is a splendid short-story writer, true, but the raw emotions in The Namesake, as well as the layered, nuanced characters make this one helluva novel! ...more \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0645\u0646\u064a\u062a \u0623\u0646 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0646\u062a\u0647\u064a! ! 3.5 stars.

It is written in a narrative style that one observes their life from a distance.. Name is used as a metaphor for one's identity and culture. As readers, we observe the family as they struggle through the 'loss of the pronunciation of their names', 'not being able to name their child as in their custom', 'modify their names so as to fit in' and so on. Anyone who has spent a couple of years as an expat in a different culture can relate to this Bengali family's life caught in-between cultures. Overall I enjoyed this book and Lahiri's style. I could have enjoyed the story even more, if it had not taken the tone of a National Geographic documentary or anthropology thesis at certain chapters, and had the writer chose to become more personal with its characters. ...more The title and the synopsis suggest a dilemma-based novel that tackles cracked identity between two directions; West and East, but this isn't what I have witnessed.

I can understand why he does this as a person; we all want to prove to our close ones, especially parents, that we are whole, are independent and can rely on ourselves by choosing who we want to be but don't we do this sometimes by wrong and false misguiding means? running away, having lots of affairs with women he has just board the train with! is this possible or is it just the normal situation about reaction of running away and outburst of accumulated things that are incomprehensible?
