{"Comments": "Wow that was a great ending to this very fantastical series! I cannot wait to go into more detail in my series review which will be out probably next week. I'll be covering my opinions on all 5 books and then my overall opinion of the series. I am so happy I FINALLY read PJO! This was a \"dam\" good series (<---B>lol get it? \"Dam\"</---B>) wow wow wow still need to get all my thoughts together but wow wow wow full video review coming soon I'm a little sad actually because I didn't want to say goodbye to our hero, the one and only Percy Jackson. From the beginning we can already see things are going to move quickly. Kronos has a lot of things up his sleeve and won't let Percy and the other demigods have a break. The book pretty much starts off with a bang and doesn't slow down from there. Annabeth and Percy's relationship is kind of strained and Rachel showing up isn't helping matters.

The book pretty much starts off with a bang and doesn't slow down from there. Annabeth and Percy's relationship is kind of strained and Rachel showing up isn't helping matters. I have to say all the books have a lot of action, but this one takes the prize. They have to make a movie of this one, it would be insanely cool. We finally get to see how the prophecy plays out,<---M> Luke's past</---M>, and many other secrets that come to light. One of things I always appreciated about the series is that we see things from all angles. We can get why some of the demigods would side with Kronos and how nobody is free from blame. Everybody and I mean everybody and their brother comes back in this book. It was fun to see some old faces and some unexpected heroes emerge. I can't pick a favorite book of the series but if forced to give an answer this one would be it. Filled with action, tough choices, betrayals, and heart, you can't beat that. The book ends with a new prophecy for the The Lost Hero . I can't see how any series could top this one, but I will be reading it of course. Towards the last part I seriously was getting kind of misty-eyed to see it all end but it was so good.<---F> So good</---F>. ...more A MILLION STARS! Perfect ending to a perfect series! I'll bet you 1,000,000 dollars that this is gonna be the best Percy Jackson book! My favorite of the series for sure! This is a great conclusion to the story, and definitely a book worth the build up of the rest of the series. It is so much fun to see how far our characters have come, and how big their fight really is. Absolutely fantastic. (upping my previous rating of four stars to five stars because I just enjoyed so many parts of this book!) Man, I loved this series so much! Totally rekindled my love for Greek mythology :) Now I cannot WAIT to start the Heroes of Olympus series!! I finished this with a smile. After finishing The Battle of the Labyrinth I had no doubt that I would love the last one. Why specifically I knew this, I have no idea. But I was right and I'm happy when I'm right. I was surprised that most of the book is set in New York City but it actually makes sense since Mount Olympus is above the Empire State Building. I liked this book so much for the same reasons that I liked the other books. It was so funny. The part with the peanut butter had me laughing I finished this with a smile.

Percy, Annabeth, Grover and Tyson are so sweet. However, don't expect a whole lot of mushy stuff it's mostly action and action. This one has the most of the series. Compared to the other Percy Jackson books this one was a bit less chipper because of all the problems but Percy takes it in stride for the most part. It is in no way a downer book. It's so good to finally know everything, and Percy is a lot smarter. After finishing the book I thought of how great Percy is, hands down the best demigod. Hercules who? Riordan is such a sly author too. He put in another prophecy in the end for another series. So now we just have to see how that might turn out. Okay so maybe you don't have to know but I want to. ...more And that is how you finish a series! Finished re-reading this\u2013\u2013and yup, it's still amazing.

Check it out here. *deep sigh* \u2665 SHIT WHAT A FINALE PROBABLY MY FAVOURITE INSTALLMENT IN THE SERIES After reading The Battle of the Labyrinth I thought it would be my favorite in the series. I can't say how wrong I was. This was it. This was the best one in the series. It was just... epic. Perfect way to end it. Reading last few pages I had a huge lump in my throat. After finishing it, I just sat there, wishing to flip it to page one, and start again. Hopefully I'll get a chance to read Heroes of Olympus soon. WOW JUST WOW. Easily my favorite book in the series! It wrapped up this series perfectly and gave hints to what would happen in the Heroes of Olympus series! I'm definitely a little in love with Percy now and have a total girl crush on Annabeth and those last couple of pages killed me (in a good way). I'm so glad I finished this series and I can't wait to start the Heroes of Olympus next year! Couldn't think of a better way to finish this series! I took me almost a month to finish this, not because it was bad but because I am revising for exams. The end of this book got me out my reading slump! So sad that this series is over:( This is the 5th Percy Jackson book I've read to my daughter Celyn. It's half-term and we've not had many carers (Celyn is very disabled and gets respite care) so we've had a chance to finish the book off. As always Celyn has supplied the rating and left the review to me.

The concluding (well - we could go to book 4.5 & 5.5) volume of the Percy Jackson series continues in the same vein as the previous volumes, though with an added sense of danger and sadness as named/known campers are killed and even PJ himself may be up for the chop. We've followed Percy from a lad of 11-ish to his 16th birthday, so girlfriends are up for debate too and both Rachel and Annabeth are in the frame. The Greek pantheon are a great choice for these sort of books as even in the oldest of writings there's very little about them that's godly except for their power. Their pettiness and bickering provide endless opportunities for conflict and plotting even without the resurgence of their titanic forebears. The final battle is a colossal affair that occupies most of the book. The variety of monsters and weapons keep the thing from getting repetitive and I had a good time reading it. The ending is satisfying with elements of tragedy mixed into the victory. Job well done. The only question now is what to read next?

In this last installment of Percy Jackson, he battles against some gods, demigods, titans, and monsters to save the world from the evil titan Lord: Kronos. The action takes place both in ancient Greek mythological times/places and in present day New York. The final confrontation between good and evil was epic.

The action takes place both in ancient Greek mythological times/places and in present day New York. The final confrontation between good and evil was epic. The last thing I could have imagined while reading the previous books was that it would take place at the center of New York. I thought Riordan was going to, somehow, transport the characters to some natural plateau or something. Wrong. When things get serious, all the chess pieces are surrounding NY; you feel the tension of battle as the sky above the Empire State Building goes full dark, you tremble along the buildings being destroyed. One of my favorite part is when his mortal friend Rachel has to tell Percy something important. She says that he message she has for him said: \u201cPerseus, you are not the hero.\u201d After really wanting to know what she had to tell him, Percy is crushed when she tells him that he is not the hero but someone else is. Percy freaks out about this. He is overcome with emotion and is disappointed in himself, taken aback by his friend\u2019s words. I felt the stab , really. I imagine how I would have reacted had it been me. It must be like when you are at work, thinking you're doing a fine job, and then someone you actually like comes and says it is actually not that good and that you're useless. Regardless, it was really amazing seeing all the demigods actually helping each other, like a big weird family. In the previous books, at Camp Half-Blood, the relationship between each \"clan\" of kids was impregnated with the atmosphere of competition, but now it's all different. Each group tries to contribute with what they can, being warfare, health or counselling, aiming to defeat a real enemy. Overall, I really like how Riordan finished Percy's journey. Differently from previous books, where, sometimes, some parts felt rushed, this one kept a steady pace all along. Everything was explained logically, leaving no doubts about any decision/event whatsoever. Interesting quotes that I didn't include in the review: It's hard to enjoy practical jokes when your whole life feels like one. ...more Because this is going to be ONE OF THE LONGEST & GIFIEST RIDES EVER This review absolutely needs it.

And I'm going all out! \u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796 Before Olympus, before the gods, there were the titans. They were monstrous and unforgiving, and they wreaked havoc on earth. The titan lord, Kronos ruled with tyranny and cruelty, indulging in cannibalism by eating his own children to prevent them from usurping him. LIKE His three eldest sons -the big dogs I mean gods together overpowered him during the last world war and chopped him into little, anchovy pieces before casting him into the depths of tartarus. Zeus became the god of the sky, Poseidon the god of the sea and Hades the god of the underworld. It's no secret, even the gods liked to have fun, popping up half-blood children here and there from their many affairs with humans. But the three eldest gods made a pact to stop siring demi-gods because their own children proved to be too powerful. But Poisedon(smart guy he is)broke the deal, cheated, and so came Percy. This is the story of one hero. LET THE ADVENTURE BEGIN... Meet the heroes.. \u25b6 Percy, son of Poseidon (god of the sea) \u25b6 Annabeth, daughter of Athena (goddess of wisdom) \u25b6 Grover erh..goat boy (protector) \u25b6 Luke, traitor who deserves to be burnt at the stake Son of Hermes (god of travellers and thieves and messengers and...) OH SHUT UP \u25b6 Clarisse, daughter of Ares (god of war) \u25b6 And Thalia, unfortunate daughter of Zeus turned into a pine tree which now protects the camp. Meet Anklusomas/Riptide(operative word being R.I.P) \u25b6 The lightning thief Delphi's prophecy for the quest You shall go west to face the god who has turned, You shall find what was stolen and see it safely returned, You shall be betrayed by the one you call friend, And fail to save what matters most in the end. Just when everyone's started getting acquainted, all hell breaks loose --well all heaven in this case. Someone steals Zeus's master bolt and a war begins to brew because Zeus blames Hades and even Poseidon. It's up to Percy to clear his and his father's name. So he journeys to the underworld. Believing that Hades is the mastermind behind the thievery, he sets out to retrieve Zeus's bolt from him. And it turns out slimy Luke's behind it all (well he never really said that but..) But not just by himself. He's Kronos' puppet working for Kronos after all. \u25b6 The sea of monsters Delphi's prophecy for the quest You shall sail the iron ship with warriors of bone, You shall find what was stolen and make it your own, But despair for your life entombed within stone, To fail without friends, to fly home alone. Thalia's pine tree which once gave the camp protection has now been poisoned. The tree is dying, camp has lost it's protective walls A quest is in order A quest for the golden fleece which has the power to nourish and give life. Percy gets a baby brother, Tyson! A cyclopes baby brother:- gods + nymph = Cyclopes And at that point I was just like oh Poisedon Together Percy, Annabeth, and Tyson venture out to the sea of monsters to get the fleece from a Cyclopes dwelling. They also happen to save Grover too from the big bully. Over the course of their journey, a little bonding takes place. Because nothing beats family. Hermes shrugged. \u201cFamilies are messy. Immortal families are eternally messy. Sometimes the best we can do is to remind each other that we\u2019re related, for better or worse \u2026 and try to keep the maiming and killing to a minimum\" And I mean nothing beats family. There\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned over the eons, it\u2019s that you can\u2019t give up on your family, no matter how tempting they make it. It doesn\u2019t matter if they hate you, or embarrass you, or simply don\u2019t appreciate your genius Back at camp, the fleece works well. Just a little bit too well. Thalia comes back to life.. Only to end up joining the eternal maidens (and in case you missed the point of the underline--emphasis rests on the words 'eternal maidens') hunting group, giving up her life as a hero...and her chances of becoming a mother . Pretty good waste of fleece if you ask me. \u25b6 The titan's curse Delphi's prophecy for the quest Five shall go west to the goddess in chains, One shall be lost in the land without rain, Campers and Hunters combined prevail, The bane of Olympus shows the trail, The titan's curse must one withstand, And one shall perish by parent's hand. Hunters pledged to the goddess, Artemis, team up with campers (Percy, Grover, Thalia), and together they go in search of Artemis and Annabeth who have both been kidnapped. And if you read the prophecy right, you'd know- Somebody did die. Or rather, somebod-ies. \u25b6 Battle of the labyrinth Delphi's prophecy for the quest You shall dwell in the darkness of the endless maze, The dead, the traitor, and the lost one raise, You shall rise or fall by the ghost king's hand, The child of Athena's final stand, Destroy with a hero's final breath, And lose a love to worse than death Grover is about to be exiled because he hasn't found god pan. Percy and his gang enter into Daelalus's labyrinth in search of god pan and also Daelalus himself before Luke can get to him and use him for all kinds of nefariouness to further his evil plan. Luke is still hung up on stupidity. Would you quit singing the same old song? You're clogging up my ear drums. Okay maybe we should have paid a little more attention to Luke's whining because in the end, Kronos finally wakes up. But not in the way I imagined. ME He's a total cheater! \u25b6 The last Olympian The great prohecy A child of the eldest gods Shall reach sixteen against all the odds, Shall see the world in endless sleep, A hero's soul, cursed blade shall reap, A single choice shall end his days, Olympus to perserve or raze A war has begun...a test of our heroes' courage and strength... There's chaos in the outside world, in the cities, in the ocean. Chaos everywhere. The risen titans are getting ready to march up to Olympus. All the gods are busy trying to hold up fort. All except the last Olympian. And Percy meets her, the goddess Hestia. \u2018I am here because when all else fails, when all the other mighty gods have gone off to war, I am all that\u2019s left. Home. Hearth. I am the last Olympian. You must remember me when you face your final decision.\u2019 She knows of his plan to take up the curse of Achilles by bathing in the river Styx. It's the only way to beat Kronos. So she bids him farewell as he goes on to face Kronos. But facing Kronos is not the end. The journey continues beyond this series. And so Percy Jackson, until soon.. credits to the owners of the gifs! \u25b6 BOOK 1- The lightning Thief \u25b6 BOOK 2- Sea of Monsters \u25b6 BOOK 3- The Titan's Curse \u25b6 BOOK 4- Battle of the Labyrinth ...more Update: Jesus, my early reviews were so fucking cringeworthy.

I felt he was a bit immature at times with the sheer density of his skull BUT. There was a war on. The fact that Percy was so so focused on the war and the prophecies and saving people (huntin' things the family business....ahem. Sorry. Winchester moment.) was also completely admirable. I cannot complain. I was worried it was going to nosedive into a triangle, but it really didn't. Like I said, though...almost the entire book was a battle. I am here for plot, characters, and witty dialogue. While I LOVE a good sword-fight, I wasn't prepared for the sheer amount of stabbing. I feel like this is the reason I wasn't totally invested. The ending was oh so perfect but a little sad. I have a love/hate relationship with series finales...I want them to be sad and powerful but I DON'T WANT THEM TO BE SAD. haha. I'm a living contradiction. (view spoiler) [ So Luke died, of course, and he killed himself and I just was so torn up about it. LUKE WASN'T ALL BAD. I really didn't hate him. I just couldn't , and knowing more of his backstory made the whole thing even more miserable. A few other minor characters carked it, but it was LUKE I was bawling over.

Pero no solo tenemos acci\u00f3n, hay drama, comedia, suspenso, misterio, y\u2026 romance, si romance , as\u00ed que Percy no solo debe preocuparse por mantener a sus amigos a salvo, por liderar a los mestizos, por salvar al Olimpo, y al planeta, no, no crean que la cosa es tan f\u00e1cil, Percy debe lidiar con los problemas del coraz\u00f3n, tratando de decidir entre su mejor amiga y compa\u00f1era de misiones, la inteligente y bonita Annabeth , y su nueva amiga especial, la que lo hace sentir normal, en su mundo de tantas cat\u00e1strofes, la espectacular Rachel Elizabeth Dare (su nombre debe decirse completo en todas las oportunidades), aunque yo sab\u00eda desde el principio cual ser\u00eda la elecci\u00f3n (view spoiler) [es Annabeth, siempre ha sido Annabeth, y siempre ser\u00e1 Annabeth \u00bfRachel quien? (hide spoiler) ] fue c\u00f3mico e interesante ver como lidia Percy con sus primeras experiencias en el amor. As\u00ed mientras la historia avanzaba, estaba en la ambivalencia frustrante que solo los mejores libros producen, ver\u00e1n quer\u00eda terminarlo, pero en realidad no quer\u00eda terminarlo \u00bfentienden? Finalmente lo termine, \u00a1y que final! , no les revelare nada importante, solo que me hizo sentir especial, y ame de ser posible un poco mas esta historia, que se ha vuelto en definitiva una de mis favoritas. As\u00ed que Percy quiero decirte que trate, en verdad lo hice, trate de cerrar el libro, de creer las mentiras, de olvidar a los Dioses, pero, resulta que la normalidad no va conmigo. Por \u00faltimo quiero decir que recomiendo esta saga a todo el mundo , a los ni\u00f1os y ni\u00f1as de todas las edades, sin son padres l\u00e9anlas a sus hijos y les aseguro que alg\u00fan d\u00eda se lo agradecer\u00e1n. \u00bfY ahora que quedara de mi, debo sentarme a llorar porque no hay m\u00e1s historias de Percy? NO hay otra saga, mas aventuras de Percy, Annabeth, Nico Di Angelo, Grover y todos los dem\u00e1s que ya conocemos y que aun no conocemos, as\u00ed que si me disculpan debo dirigirme inmediatamente a comprar todos los libros de \u201cLos h\u00e9roes del Olimpo\u201d [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more Very happy to have finished this series. It was fun but it was just a little young for me. Definitely will carry on and read the Heroes of Olympus and see if I like those better ! I still cannot believe what I read. This book had so many levels of awesome that attempting to grasp it would be like trying to fit a double-ended piece of thread through the head of a needle. This finale was just a never-ending rollercoaster ride and I think the best series ending I've ever read!:D Nico, you're my new religion. Words of wisdom by my favorite 12-year old: Percy: \"Your powers drain you too much.\" Nico: \"With great power...comes great need to take a nap. Wake me up later.\" Perfection The final installment of the Percy Jackson series was everything that I wanted it to be!! I loveeedd the ending!!!!!! The Battle of the Labyrinth and The Last Olympian I think are both tied as my favorites in this series! :D I can't wait to read more from Rick Riordan soon!
