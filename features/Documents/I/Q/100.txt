There were parts of the story that I figured out, and even though I wanted the novel to end one way, I applaud Mead\u2019s unpredictability. Does that sentence totally contradict itself?? Let me see if I can explain. In my quest to keep this spoiler free it may be more difficult, but here it goes. I knew that something big was going to happen to one of the characters in this novel. The clues where there the foreshadowing was set up wonderfully. And even though I had an idea of what was going to happen, Mead was still able to surprise me in the end. Why? Because, I never really thought she would do it. The ending wasn\u2019t what I wanted I\u2019ll admit that, but I don\u2019t think I would have been happy with it being any other way. One of the reasons I\u2019m such a fan of this novel, besides the extraordinary writing ability of <---A>Richelle Mead</---A>, is Rose Hathaway. Let me just tell you how much I love Rose. She\u2019s beautiful, smart, confident, she\u2019s a smart ass and she kicks ass.<---F> I want to be her</---F>. She is one of my all time favorite literary characters. I absolutely cannot wait to read the rest of this series. ...more I think I have to assume that something devastating will happen in every series that Mead writes.

I'm actually still feeling the effects of this novel and I had to quickly order the next two books to find out what happens. On the heels of the death of her friend, Rose finds out that she's going to start six weeks of field exercise along with the other senior novices. The problem is though, Rose is seeing ghosts and feeling a terrible rage whenever angered or cornered. Rose had her temper before but something is different about these feelings. And being visited by the dead isn't helping her in going back to living any sort of normal life. Rose has grown up since the incident from the previous book and the people around her take notice. Rose isn't the only one changing though and she has to deal with these circumstances as a new threat from the Strigoi looms. I FLEW through this book. I think I could read about Rose and her friends all day every day and not get bored. Honestly though, I think I feel this way about all of Mead's heroines so I could be biased. I love the characters,<---M> the story</---M>, the way the world is crafted, and Mead's simple yet effective writing style. This series is miles above any teen series I've come across and it rivals some adult series I've read as well and it's quickly become one of my top favorite series ever. Great addition to the series and I can't wait until my order from Amazon ships! My reviews of books two and four: Frostbite and Blood Promise . ...more I can't write a proper review for this. My little heart is too broken for it. THAT ENDING Okay okay I just hope the other books are good as well. I mean, I've heard this one is the best one so far and then it all just fades.

I have declared that he is my book boyfriend. He was so serious and focused on his job but you couldn't help but see his true feelings for Rose and that is what made him so much better. Rose Hathway. She is the best female protagonist. Even though she was questioning whether she was crazy or not, she was so strong and was willing and did put so many others before her. The minor characters were pretty cool. I did like Adrian, despite his bad drinking and smoking habits, and I hope that we are able to hear more of him in the rest of the series. I am also glad about Eddie and how he changed over time even though it was a little sad. Speaking of sadness, this book had so many sad parts, especially nearing the end. There was death and don't get me started to who turned Strigoi. Rose has to figure out a way to get him changed back! There was a slight cliff hanger at the end but I still liked it. On a parting note, this gif pretty much sums up how I saw Rose at the end of the book: Only if Teresa Palmer had dark hair, tanner skin, and Rose had some fire powers that Christian had. ...more I feel like it doesn't get better than this.Rose is finally becoming more mature,the whole story was really interesting and captivating,there are a lot of serious issues and topics included in this book and the characters are finally starting to feel... real.

They come first. I've lived my life for you. I've trained to be your shadow, but you know what? I want to come first. I need to take care of myself for once. I'm tired of looking out for everyone else and having to put aside what I want. Dimitri and I did that, and look what happened. He's gone. I will never hold him again. Now I owe it to him to do this.

(hide spoiler) ] I've come too far not to try out Blood Promise and, who knows, maybe I'll actually like it. There's too much I must find out for me to give up on this series just yet. Forgetting about the next book for a second, Shadow Kiss just ticked all the right boxes for me. I really like the mix of vampire politics amidst the love and heartbreak. Even though vampire issues might not exactly be relevant in our society, you can understand a lot of what lies behind it. For example, Rose has been brought up her entire life believing that Moroi \"come first\" and should always be protected, even to the point of laying her life down for them. Dhampirs, like Rose, are little other than instruments to ensure the safety of Moroi royalty. But this book starts to question why Dhampirs should sacrifice their lives and choices in order to serve a race that largely finds them expendable. And then, even within the Moroi ranks, there is a great deal of inequality with regards to which Moroi receive protection. There's a political statement going on here somewhere under the surface and I like it. Today's society might not have Moroi/Dhampir issues but battles for equality and class issues are still very relevant. I just wanted to mention this now in my fear that this will be my final overly positive review in the Vampire Academy series. I hope not, but taking Rose away from the setting I've come to love... well, let's just say, so many things can go wrong from here. My negative mind is already seeing the numerous things that could make Blood Promise a chore to read. ...more (I realized that I wasn't able to make a review of this book. Lol.

I was wrong, terribly wrong but let\u2019s save that for when I do reviews of Spirit Bound and Last Sacrifice , shall we? In Shadow Kiss, Rose is suffering the trauma of the Spokane incident and Mason\u2019s death- which adds another twist: she is able to see his ghost and is connected to the world of the dead. While being haunted by Mason, she is also facing field experience (where the Dhampir novices guard Moroi for 6 weeks while they are tested throughout the time) while creaming over Dimitri (honestly, what did you expect?) and hating on her best friend for no apparent nor valid reason, she torments over choosing between them until of course a tragic event changes everything. I definitely liked the pacing of the book, more so than I did with Frostbite, because something new and interesting was brought up at certain intervals so it kept the reader\u2019s interest so the structure of the plot was pretty good. I also liked how in this book, we delved more into the Spirit element and the shadow-kissed bond- its dark side-effects of mental instability was definitely very interesting to read about as it explained why Rose was able to see ghosts which causes complications and her dark attitude throughout the books. I thought it definitely made the story move forward and I thought that it could be used for a lot of potential in the future books, looking in foresight. (I was wrong about this too, hindsight changes everything, people.) What I also liked was how the Moroi monarchy/politics system worked and we saw how they functioned too when Rose & Lissa travel there to visit Queen Tatiana in the Royal Court. I also love how in this book, there was a multiple storyline going on and each character had their own arc: - e.g. Lissa being with Christian when the Queen wanted her to be paired up with Adrian, causing Christian to be jealous of Adrian whilst Rose having to choose between Lissa and Dimitri (I don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass if you think it\u2019s romance, it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s glorifying hero-worship), how it all intertwines together to create drama (that\u2019s isn\u2019t something like Gossip Girl or Days of Our Lives ) that is realistic and not exaggerated is a plus for me, because mostly in YA, there is so much bullshit in the air that I can smell it when turning over the pages. Now on to the characters:- in my honest opinion, Rose seems to be getting more immature & hypocritical as the story goes on. I couldn't handle her angst in this book because it was getting ridiculous! I specifically remember in Vampire Academy, that Rose criticized two guardians that ran off together yet in Shadow Kiss, she constantly complains about how bad her life is, how she can never live her own life and how Lissa is to blame for the situation she is in. If you don\u2019t fucking want to be a guardian then don\u2019t be a guardian- no one is forcing her to become a guardian plus it\u2019s been established that the ones that are guardians who go off and live with humans, get jobs and live a normal life. I just only think she is doing it to impress Dimitri, because Dimitri always seem to appreciate her more if she does something \u201cguardian\u201d like. She also hates Lissa for not being able to understand how hard it is for her, for fuck\u2019s sake, I know that the bond only works one way but you can still tell her how you fucking feel. That\u2019s what best friends are for, how is she supposed to know if you are \u201csuffering\u201d when you\u2019re acting like a prissy bitch by keeping secrets? I don\u2019t see what hardships she is facing, she was brought up with Lissa\u2019s family who welcomed her, looked after her and treated her as if she was their own daughter by giving her what she wanted and taking her to places yet she calls herself a \u201clowly dhampir\u201d even though she prizes herself by being around royal Moroi? I'm sorry I didn\u2019t realise growing up with Royals was soooo horrible compared to growing up in a blood whore commune(!) *eyeroll* Dimitri is still a dumb bastard, I can only think of two people that can give him personality: Tasha Ozera and hot chocolate. Rose is meant to be a character that stands her ground in any given situation yet everything changes when she is with Dimitri, he slutshames/degrades her for her age yet she just takes it in even saying that he is right. What the fuck ? Yet people still call her a good heroine ? She fucking isn\u2019t. Period. It becomes more apparent in this book that the only reason that he even likes her is because she is physically strong- notice how \u201csuddenly\u201d he becomes close to her after she killed Strigoi in Frostbite yet neglects her prior to that incident or how he comes all starry-eyed when she tackles him. See? This relationship is just based on physical assets; she calls him \u201cbadass\u201d and \u201cGod\u201d (Also Richelle Mead, thank you so fucking much for ruining the word badass for me and also \u2018God\u2019- I was an agnostic and now I am strictly atheist, you twat.) similarly he loves her because she is strong. It makes sense as to why he was also attracted to Tasha- she fought and killed Strigoi who happened to be her sister and her brother-in-law initially showing strength as Moroi aren\u2019t known to be physical fighters. What makes me sick is how the whole romance was based on a forced lust spell (even if there was a hint of an attraction, it was still forced), it\u2019s gross and vile, she was a victim in that incident yet she glorifies the moment like its Christmas or something. Likewise how she is falling prey to Dimitri\u2019s child grooming especially when he is in a position of power because that itself is a form of abuse and I don\u2019t know why the fuck Richelle Mead is making it seem lawful. Oops. Silly me. Dimitri is hot. That excuses him from everything (!) The sex scene was boring, I'm a virgin and I could write better- the quote \u201cI didn\u2019t know where my body began and his ended\u201d reminded me of The Human Centipede which made me react like this: I hated Dimitri for taking advantage of her when she was at her most vulnerable, for fuck\u2019s sake, if a girl is crying because she is going crazy, you do not just whip your dick out and shag her so she can shut up. Yes, the Montana age of consent is 16 but the Moroi/Dhampir society do not follow their rules as 18 is the rightful age for being an adult according to their own laws. Anyway moving on to much brighter things in the book: Adrian- I loved him in this book and I was delighted to see development of his character that he isn\u2019t just this drunken, bad boy faced but he has a heart of gold. He genuinely seems to care for Rose and although he is of Royal blood- he treats her as an equal . His lines made me have a good laugh and the chemistry between him and Rose has the power to become something amazing and I think that their romance would beat Rose and Dimitri by a fucking mile. How Rose treated him at the end of this book was not right by playing with his feelings to get money for her dumb \u201cfind-Dimitri-&-feel-the-power-of-his-tiny-dick-again-lol\u201d and I honestly believe he deserves so much better than her. So to all you reviewers who are thinking I am a bitter Rose and Adrian fan, I'm not, because Rose and Dimitri deserve each other for being the two dumbest shitheads I have ever read about since Edward and Bella. I loved Lissa and Christian; they seem to be the only couple I care about at this stage because a.) they have a lot of intense lovin\u2019 going on- I was turned on in the first couple of lines, not going to lie and b.) they seem like a healthy balanced relationship whose characteristics compliments each other and actually encourage each other to become a better person. I also loved Christian and Rose\u2019s warm friendship that developed, it was hilarious yet cute seeing those two interact and my favourite part of the whole book was when they both teamed up to fight Strigoi with his power and her stake skills. I also rate Richelle Mead (even though I have problems with her primary romances in her books) for killing off Dimitri and making him into a Strigoi, I was cheering personally, but I loved how intense it was because usually most YA authors would never do that to their love interests, especially to the principal one. I admire her for going there and building momentum in this series because it made the ending a whole lot more powerful. The rest of the characters I liked. Eddie is one of those characters that I just love because he is always there for Rose, Mia has developed a lot and I like that, and I also liked Tatiana because she seemed to ooze power and control and made the plot a lot more interesting. I didn\u2019t like Jill, she just seemed to be there so she can jizz her pants over Rose and Dimitri to show how super ~speshul they are and she had no real value to the plot line. Overall, aside certain things, I really liked this book, the writing has improved and she certainly stepped up in her game which is why this book stands out for me amongst other YA novels. ...more Shadow Kiss is the third installment in The Vampire Academy Series and it is by far, my favorite book in the series!

Her best friend Lissa- the last Dragomir princess- must always come first. Unfortunately, when it comes to gorgeous tutor Dimitri Belikov, some rules are meant to be broken... Including school rules and the law when she takes her romance with Dimitri to the next step... love.

Plot I pretty much suck at summarizing so I just copy-paste that portion, kind-of. I love the idea of the Qualifying exams because I get to see Rose in action! But what is the most epic aspect of the book? The unexpected twists! I am really really caught of guard and totally did not expect that. I admit that there are a number of books that made me cry, and if they did make me cry, it was a lot. This book is no exception, it was really emotional. Everything about it. But I had to control the tears from my face because I was reading this in class but they were already dropping! This following conversation happens. My seatmate: Hey, Jianne. Are you okay? *Me sniffing and pretending to scratch my eyes* Jianne: Yeah, I'm cool. *smiles* My seatmate: You crying or something? Jianne: *pretends to be innocent* No, just scratching. My seatmate: *doubtful look but nods* Because I do not want to look like a total physco and crybaby in class. The teacher might call my mom and say I'm crying or something like that. You get the point. But seriously, if I was just at home I'd really cry my heart out. This book, everything in it, the plot especially is a total knockout. Characters I love Rose's character. It is true that the reader will detect the change of her character in the book, she's more mature and much much more better than before. Not only physically but emotionally as well. I love how she puts Lissa's life ahead of hers. They say she's she acts harshly but I believe she's logical when it comes to making decisions. She can kick ass and she's such a fierce heroine! I love her. My husband, Harry approves too! Forgive me if you will, but I totally do not like Lissa's character. Okay, royalty and last Dragomir but hey, her character is nothing compared to Rose's. It's just so annoying that even if yes, she is a royal but that doesn't mean she has to depend on her all the time. She's so goody goody, being pretty pretty and not very verbal about her emotions which annoys me. Just let it out. And for most of the happenings of the book, she has (unintentionally) affect Rose negatively. And this spirit power thing, yeah she can heal people but it's pretty lame if you ask me since she doesn't even wanna use it for whatever Rose asked her to use it in the end. It's useless too. Not really since Rose is shadow-kissed but for the most part it is. Rose's character overshadows her character because she's so opposite to her. Adrian? So hot. So sexy. Love his flirtatiousness and playing-the-bad-boy-role. Whatever he said to Rose at the end? It made me melt to pieces. I certainty did not expect that. See, not all guys who act like assholes are actually one. I'm one of Adrian's crazy fangirls. Romance For some unknown reason, I have the desire for Rose and Christian to have some form of connection. Is that because I don't like Lissa's character? Possibly. I just don't like her. I can't explain it into words, but I just don't. Anyway, well in the book Rose and Christian are going to be sort-of close but only as friends. So I am disappointed. BUT. There's Adrian AND Rose. So not really that disappointed. Under normal circumstances, I would've been annoyed if a guy continues to flirt with a girl that clearly has no interest in him. But Adrian is an exception. He is just hard to resist. I have that weakness in boys. It sucks. But I love Adrian and Rose's interactions which contrast a lot to Dimitri and Rose's interactions which is sounding so professional. Oh, and I think I need to add this too. (view spoiler) [It was sad to see Mason's ghost again. I feel like my heart is going to fall after sacrificing himself before then he appears to help her. Even in death, he still cares. It makes me cry. Out of happiness. (hide spoiler) ] And of course, Dimitri and Rose shouldn't be forgotten. At first, I admit that I was not a big fan of this couple. But things change. Especially whatever happens in the end. I've come to conclude that well, there is still some spark for me with this couple. Especially whatever will happen to them throughout this book, they've went through a lot and that proves that love conquers all. And age is nothing but a number. Besides, their love story is forbidden love ain't THAT my favorite kind of story. And besides. (view spoiler) [Dimitri took away Rose's virginity. That means they REALLY love each other. So okay, I do like them now okay? (hide spoiler) ] Ending Totally unexpected. Epic. Masterpiece. Emotional. Great. Bravo. I'm out of adjectives but I'll just say that the ending is wonderful. In the next book, I'm sure I'll be reading a whole new side of Rose. Again. The much more emotional, fragile, independent and braver side of Rose. I'm sure she'll be facing a lot of problems. As in. I'm excited. Love the ending, totally. I though it was this but it turned out to be this. So my reaction was this. Richelle Mead? My new favorite author! This series started light now it's going heavy! Hang on tight then.

I've got two things to tell you all: 1) SOS: Save our Sandra 2) SSS: Save Sandra's Sanity Thank you. Five stars for round two! Yet again. I love everyone. Our main characters, that is. I don't know how every other single freaking character manages to be a supreme asshole (Jesse, Ralf, and the rest of the fucking crew). All the freaking gossip about Rose like: owh my gawd, did you hear.... Rose is it tarue that...... You should TOWTALLY become a blood whore... Rose do you rilly hate Christian Ozera?? Rose why are u such a bitch? Rose is it tarue you're only doing half-time because ur mentally unhinged?? You get the idea.....blatant and total 100% asshole-ism. I spelled things wrong so you can read it in the voice of a stereotypical annoying gossip/valley gurl accent. I'm not stupid, I promise. Ah the ROMANCE WAS THE BEST!!! Guys, we've been over this 100 million times. I love Dimka SO much!! We know Rose (view spoiler) [was a virgin (hide spoiler) ] . Me? I'm dying to know if Dimka (view spoiler) [was a virgin (hide spoiler) ] ! Completely out of curiosity. I have asked Richelle that question twice here on Goodreads. The first time was on her author page. The second time was also on her page, but that time she actually said she was answering questions for VA's 10-year anniversary. Sadly, I received no response both times. Richelle needs to write a pre-Vampire Acadamey Dimka novella!!! Get on this Richelle!!!! Please! I'm begging you! See my old review below. BUT BE WARNED THERE ARE UNCOVERED SPOILERS!! ___________________________________________________________ NOOOOOOOOOOOO...etc. tears tears tears tears of devastation tears of joy tears of love...so many emotions!!! This review is filled with SPOILERS! So leave if you haven't read!! I'm gonna start with Dimitri because he is my book crush. I love this guy, because he is so bomb, nice, handsome, and generally pretty awesome all round! Also because I am a sucker for mature and gentlemenly males. I found out before I read the book that he turns Strigoi so pretty much throughout the entire book I was devastated and sweating and waiting for him to turn Strigoi with the next page turn! and then when he did I was like *clench my fist at the heavens* \"WHYYYY HIM?!\". And literally after he and Rose FINALLY are a couple (albeit a secret one). Rose is again a very mature character in this book. So now she is seeing ghosts! It seems typical that no one would believe her. I hope every one does since she used said ghosts to lead the guardians to the Strigoi cave. Also every time she kept that secret I was like \"You gotta tell someone already! This isn't gonna work for anyone!\" Finally she told Dimitri and the doctors so that was good. Throughout the entire book, every scene with her and Dimitri is intimate as in like the air between them...no touching, when suddenly....BOOM! They have sex. I guess they were just depriving themselves for too long. The guardians FINALLY realized that they should be using Moroi powers...especially fire Moroi....because dude, like COMMON SENSE! They specialize in FIRE that is the freaking WEAKNESS of their mortal enemies...like what?! Queen What's-her-face....totally hate her! She shouldn't be playing matchmaker. Also she is an old hag who's having affairs with a very young and handsome blood whore Dhampir. She shouldn't talk about relationships, especially those that don't concern her. Also this dude Ambrose, doens't it concern him that he's the lover of an old, ugly, and mean hag? He could probably have ANY girl he wanted but chose the one wayyyy out of his league. Lissa and Christian, cute as usual. Adrian? So he actually likes Rose? I still think she should avoid him and/or let him down another hundred times before he gets it. I ship Dimitrose. Not Adriose! Also another note on Rose's maturity level....how noble of her that she decides she going to kill Dimitri. Most characters are like \"oh I love him and I want him to be happy so I'll give him what he wants\", usually meaning if they want another relationship or something that this person disagrees with. Rose is all like \"I know he would hate himself if he knew he turned Strigoi. He told me he'd rather die so I shall indulge him\". That is so thoughtful of her, though I'd rather she find a way to un-Strigoi him. I'm so EXCITED to read the next book! NEED...MORE...DIMITRI...THAT....ISN'T STRIGOI!! AAAHHH! ...more The worst cliffhanger in the history of cliffhangers. And all the feels on top of it. I feel dizzy... Shadow Kiss started off slow, but ended up being great. I really like how Ms. Mead takes things to a level where not everything has a happy ending. It has realistic qualities for being a young adult paranormal book. I felt Rose's pain and confusion as she struggled with what she had to deal with being \"shadow kissed\". I enjoyed her interactions with Lissa, Dmitri and Adrian. Even though I inadvertently knew a big piece of the story, it didn't happen as I envisioned. This book has a lot of heart, Shadow Kiss started off slow, but ended up being great.

I cried like a baby... I rarely thought about Dimitri as someone with a life away from me. You know who else thinks people disappear when they leave the room? Infants. It's a concept that they have to grow out of - figuring out that people have lives apart from when they are in the child's presence. It's called \"Object Permanence\" and according to my old psychology book, a child should have fully developed object permanence by the age of 2. In other words, although Rose shows signs of maturity on rare occasions, she h I rarely thought about Dimitri as someone with a life away from me.

In other words, although Rose shows signs of maturity on rare occasions, she has a long way to go. Also, have we all noticed that Rose has some major daddy-issues? She always says how she wants Dimitri to \"be proud of her\" and she gets upset if he seems disappointed in her. It's creepy the way she thinks of him. Definitely not as an equal partner - you know, like you should think about the person you are in a relationship with. There is a reason that it is unethical for people in positions of power to date their subordinates. The whole psychology of people dating an authority figure shows how wrong it is. Dimitri should be fired for dating a student. And, what does Dimitri see in Rose anyway? She is selfish, immature, impulsive, bratty, disrespectful, and a bragger. She's 17 going on 13. Why would he be attracted to that? Do I really need to get out the psychology book again about him maybe getting off on having power over her, or her hero-worship of him? This is supposed to be a book review, not a review of my old textbook! Okay, that's a lot of stuff I don't like about this book. Let's push it aside for now. On the positive side: I like many of the other characters. Christian and Adrian are my favorites. I also like the humor. It was fun when Rose was assigned to guard Christian (after she threw her temper-tantrum, of course). Christian: \"You and me are going to have so much fun, Rose. Picking out curtains, doing each other's hair, telling ghost stories...\" And, hey, there is even one thing I like about Rose! No one had ever called me unnatural before, except for the time I put ketchup on a taco. Finally, something I can respect. Because I have put ketchup on tacos before and it is the bomb! Ketchup and sour cream on a taco? Try it! I swear that anyone I've ever actually gotten to try it has liked it. (That list is small for some reason!) Will I trudge on to the next book? Yes. I hate not finishing stories, even if I'm not loving them. I have a problem. Maybe I need to get out that old psychology textbook after all. ...more DON'T TOUCH ME I AM NOT OK My feels were broken. 3 First read in February 2014 Oh god... Dimitri... I can't even... That ending! Pretty much took off a star because I was disgusted with how Rose treated Adrian in the end. No matter how hurt you are it doesn't give you the right to use people in such a way. What a fucking bitch she is sometimes. Apart from that thing, this was the best one so far. Can't wait to see what happens next. This is the third book in the VAMPIRE ACADEMY series and I highly recommend you read the first two books before reading this one. I read all 400 plus pages of this book in one day ~ it grabbed my attention from the very first and I could not put it down. Intense, suspenseful and full of shocking surprises ~ I can't wait until the next book is released! 2/4/2014 Buddy (re)read with my smart friend Yani just to hold her hand whenever she needs it. Mrs Mead, why can they just be happy?? why? Juliet had it easy... Damn it. This was amazing. Still my favorite in the series. I think the dynamics Christian/Rose and Adrian/Rose were one of the best things of the story. Obviously, the cabin scene was still amazing but what about Christian and Rose teaming up to fight Strigoi? Man, that was epic. The whole thing took under a minute.

Yeah. We were badasses. Reading Adrian again makes me wanna go and read Bloodlines right away. I think he was a victim in Richelle's hands and it really hurts to see him pleading for a chance with Rose when it was obvious she belonged to Dimitri. I had no fucking idea who \"Andre\" was and what the hell I was talking about in my previous review... after re-reading it, I understood. Andre is actually Adrian LOL I'm such a moron sometimes. ____________ So far, the best of the series. Taking YA books to another level. Mrs Mead, thank you ^^ The battle was epic, Andre was even more charming (is that possible?), Dimitri as perfect as always and the ending... oh, my, the ending... Finally Rose opened her heart to Lissa. That moment was perfect. ...more<---C>Vasilisa \"Lissa\" Dragomir</---C>", "Title": "Shadow Kiss"},
