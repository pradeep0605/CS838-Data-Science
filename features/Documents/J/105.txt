It will give Jerry Sandusky and the like something to read while in prison. In spite of a good tale, and vivid characters, I couldn't get beyond, (nor should anyone) the defense of child abuse, (\"it was only fondling\") and the vilification of someone who \"dug up\" more victims. The fact that the story is so well done makes it worse, in that it carries some legitimacy to the idea of abuse being minimal. The subtext of abuse was not primary to the story, but it was definitely central - you couldn't miss it. No one would permit an defense of racism or rape or any other illegal and immoral activities. Seriously, this needs to be addressed. At first I assumed it was revealing the context of the story, but when the main character immediately jumped to the defense of a pedophile, I was shocked and sickened. This story should be edited, updated, something. Publishers, please read the news, get some information from the young people who were \"only fondled\" and check your facts. I would wonder if this sort of defense is culpable in the continued abuse of children - it offers a way to spin the crime to make the perpetrators more sympathetic, and any accusers vilified. Shame! ...more I read P D James avidly for many years, until one day I just could not stomach her extreme right-wing contempt for every non-Dalgleish character. However, I've have always acknowledged her great skill as a writer, which finally brought me back to this book recently. Yes, the woman can write. The setting is fascinating, the characters are pretty good. She really conveys the beauty of the landscape, and the tragic destruction of a way of life dedicated to knowledge, peace and clarity of purpose.

She really conveys the beauty of the landscape, and the tragic destruction of a way of life dedicated to knowledge, peace and clarity of purpose. Dalgleish is as constipated and tight-jawed as ever. If not for the adulation given him by the other characters, I might mistake him for a man who is so tied up in his own dignity that he is a walking corpse. Honestly, track any conversation he has in the novel. He barely speaks, and what he does say is as boring as batshit. However, my main grievance here is that the murderer's motivations make NO SENSE! Okay, I get that the motivation is to get the seminary shut down so his son will inherit a metric fuckton of money. So why viciously murder the guy who is doing everything he can to shut down the seminary? WHY the secrecy about the marriage? Why kill the first victim to keep her quiet about the marriage?? Surely it will have to come out if the son is to inherit. What difference does it make to keep it secret? I just can't make sense of it at all, and it's really bugging me. Oh, and the staunch sympathy for the plight of the poor pedophile priest? Yes, he was such a victim! Wait, WHAT?!?! Seriously, WTF? ...more I enjoyed the setting and I do like Commander Dalgliesh.

It certainly is. It was odd to read. The author worked in criminal justice. In fact there were some other disturbing sexual relations going on in this book at the theological college that everyone just kind of looked the other way. I don't remember this from other <---A>P.D.

This novel confers additional blessing in its portrain of Anglo-Catholic Anglicanism in Britain. If that scene holds any interest for you (ahem ... it does for me), then this book delivers a double payload of entertainment. I think I must be the only person in the western world who hadn't read the work of PD James. What a fantastic writer and she's written so many books. I look forward to working my way through her stories. I've read this before, seen it on tv, and it held up to yet another reading. I've always been interested in the way James teases out the effects of nasty things people do or say to each other as well as of death in suspicious circumstances. Here she takes time to create her characters and to lead us into understanding the tensions within this small, isolated community, disrupted from its usual quiet routines by external pressures from the church hierarchy and a group of weekend visitors.

Was it an accident, suicide, or murder? Dalgliesh, the son of a rector, has former ties to the school - as a young teen, he spent several happy summer holidays there among the priests and ordinands. There is no shortage of possible suspects, or motives, for Ronald's death. But before Dalgliesh even arrives on the scene, another death occurs - a death everyone else considers natural and expected. Dalgliesh wonders otherwise. As the body count continues to rise, so too the means, motive and opportunity of almost the entire community of St. Anselms. Dalgliesh and his team steadily work to reveal the killer or killers before someone else falls victim. Long-time widower Dalgliesh is furthered hampered in the investigation by his unexpected feelings for a visiting guest lecturer, Emma Lavenham. Will the possibility of love turn out to be a blessing or curse for Dalgliesh? <+++>Death in Holy Orders</+++> is another extremely entertaining whodunnit by P.D. James, and without a doubt my favorite (so far) of the three I've read (in backwards order). Very possibly, this has everything to do with the excellent TV adaptation starring Martin Shaw as Dalgliesh, Robert Hardy as Father Martin and Jesse Spencer as Raphael Arbuthnot. The movie stayed fundamentally true to the events from the book, but also added another layer of texture to the story and characters IMO. The thing I liked most about the story was the backdrop; St. Anselms, the fictional elitist theological college on a remote Suffolk coast, which is known for turning out the best and brightest Anglican priests, but is now in danger of being decommissioned by the CoE powers that be (not to mention the very real threat of the college tumbling into the North Sea by an eroding cliffline). The solitude found in and around the setting, along with the contemplative (almost monastic) aspect of the story definitely appealed to my personal taste. The characters carried around their own brand of P.D. James' favorite pet vices; petty power struggles, greed, various sexual insecurities/proclivities, religious apathy and a pervading sense of depression. Good, if predictable, fare. I'll have more, please. ...more Another well crafted mystery with a series of murders and intrigues set at a private school run by the Anglican church near London. Again the protagonist detectives wend their ways through the hints and clues and ultimately the crimes are solved. It was a good book to read. Not too easy to solve and the characters ran true.

I have read previous reviewers who mention the paedophile priest. This storyline was only mentioned 3 times in the entire book and was in no way part of the story so do not let you put you off. The book starts with finding the dead body of Ronald Treeves, a young theology student at St Anselms. Ronald died climbing a sandy cliff which fell suffocating him. The coroner deemed his death as suicide, Ronald a prominent man is not happy with the ruling and asks Adam to investigate. Adam is in a weeks leave and actually stayed at St Anselms as a child so he is quite happy to speak to the staff. It is arranged that Adam will stay at the college but will joined with some other guests over the weekend. The guests are Roger Yarwood a policeman on sick leave, a man writing a thesis on St Anselms, Emma Lavenham a university lecturer and Father Martin Petrie. Perrier is not a nice man and upsets the priests by wanting to close the college. Surprise, surprise during the weekend Father John is murdered and the death of Ronald Treeves takes a backseat. When the Suffolk police allow The Met to investigate the killing, Adam and his team encounter secrets at the college which nearly result in the death of Adam. This was an enjoyable story by P D James, however I have only awarded four stars because I could not work out the motivation of the killer. ...more P. D.

James continues to write very literate and interesting mysteries featuring her well-read inspector Adam Dalgliesh. This recent edition has a great story, although the motivations of the murderer left me disbelieving. His rationale just did not seem especially valid, but the scenarios and characters are complex and interesting. The setting for this novel is St. Anselm's, a small theological college on a lonely stretch of the Anglian coast, so isolated that a fallen tree on the only road to the college can effectively block all access to it. The students are housed in an old Victorian mansion with all sorts of nooks and crannies. Increasingly threatened by the financial burdens on the college, the local archdeacon wants to close the college -- he becomes one of the murder victims -- but his past ties with one of the teachers make his judgments suspect. All of the professors and some of the ordinands (those studying to become Anglican priests) have nefarious events in their past or antipathy toward one or other of the rest of the characters. A local police inspector is there for a while, recuperating from psychological problems, and he has reason to hate the archdeacon, an antipathy reciprocated because of the investigator\u2019s investigation into the death of the archdeacon's first wife and his ongoingl certainty of the archdeacon's culpability. Dalgliesh becomes involved because he had been asked to investigate the ostensible suicide of one of the ordinands who had apparently killed himself by lying under an outcropping of sand and then causing it to collapse suffocating himself. Dalgliesh has nostalgic memories of the college, having spent some time there in his youth. By the end of the investigation, several others have been killed in order to hide a secret \u2014 and this is where the plot falls apart, I think \u2014 that would have, by necessity, have come out in any case. In a portrayal of human evil, James reveals a nasty mess of intertwined jealousy, greed, deceit, anger and revenge, not to ignore murder. The ultimate cause of the murders is the endowment that, if the college is closed, will pass to the remaining professors, or to the heir of the Arbuthnot estate. It gets wonderfully complicated, and James's nonpareil writing holds one enthralled right to the end despite my earlier caveat. ...more I get annoyed with PD James because of the feeling that surrounds her that says that she's head and shoulders better than every other crime writer around. That and the fact that she only writes about terribly posh people as if that's all there is in the world.

This is a version of the very traditional English detective story - deaths in a small community where only an insider can be guilty. The story is nothing terribly inventive and there are a hundred crime writers out there writing tales set around much better plots. The characters here are pretty well drawn though; I find them all slightly unbelievable just because of who they are but they do appear real all the same. There's a sense that James is taking the mickey out of herself when someone comments that not all of the twenty students at the theological college the book is set at have had priviledged upbringings - one of them actually came through the state school system. I haven't read any James for quite a while, apart from rereading the two Cordelia Grey books on audio last year, I read most of them as a teenager and I'm not sure I'd be able to put up with the characters for long enough to read them all again now. I always find Inspector Kate Miskin to be a shadow of what she could be. Her background is one of poverty and working her way up the ranks of the Met and it never rings true. Kate sometimes feels out of place in the circles Dalgleish moves in, both social and literary, but I always feel she's just been put in for show. Perhaps it's just that at the end of the day she is the sidekick and Dalgleish is the main attraction but I do wish James had made her more than she has. This isn't a bad book just not a terribly exciting, interesting or innovative one. ...more Typical mediocre mystery fiction. This book was as predictable as it was long. From the first scene portrayed in the book, the conclusion is obvious. It seems as if James is trying to sneak little clues in so when the reader finishes (shocked, of course, at the outcome \"I NEVER saw that one coming!\") he can return to the beginning and discover the subtle clues that in fact verify the conclusion. The problem is, her subtle clues are a few shades less than subtle. James seems intent on playing mind Typical mediocre mystery fiction. This book was as predictable as it was long.

Wait a minute! \" The only main theme one can pull from this rather pretentious little novel is that pigs do not stink. It seems as though the author is a pig enthusiast and can't bear the thought that so many people think they have an unpleasant odor. Character development suffers, particularly on the part of the hero, commander Adam Dalgliesh. The reader comes to be more enamored with the (rather perverse) sub-characters than with the protagonist. James' feeble attempt at inserting a romantic element is sickening. Dalgliesh is first drawn to a \"ravishingly beautiful\" murder suspect, feeling a strange attraction that, we are told, he has not felt since the death of his wife. Poorly done. Long. Dragging. Lame climax. ...more Quite an interesting book, but did not really sustain interest till the end. If your interest in crime fiction drops once you find out who the murderer is, and you don't care much for the chase for proof which could serve the prosecution's case, then the last 50 odd pages in this book are superfluous. However, I haven't read the earlier Dalgleish novels and I suppose the prolonged ending was included to finally show how Dalgleish found peace in the restoration of justice.

James on CD during a cross-country road trip through Big Sky Country\u2014Montana. Even though the speed limit in the wide open expanse is already high (80 mph in many areas), we found ourselves pressing the accelerator with increasing intensity as the plot thickened with sinister twists and turns. We\u2019ll definitely accompany Commander Adam Dalgliesh on future investigations! Very atmospheric, gripping crime story. My first PD James so some of the references to Dalglish's private life were lost on me but the story itself is well-written and a real page turner.

There are interwoven plotlines about expensive art, unknown family connections, religious artifacts, guests and staff with their own secrets and agendas, and power struggles within the church hierarchy. These all come together to make for a compelling mystery read. Another great book in this series! ...more Definitely one of the lesser P.D. James books for me, with an aspect that troubled me morally. The setting - a secluded old estate by the sea, with a few quaint old cottages for commoners - seemed overly familiar. So did the participants - a collection of well-off academics who only enjoy high culture. The characterisation felt black-and-white. Main character Dalgliesh was annoyingly self-righteous, distant and superior, but the writer never showed that in a negative light. Dalgliesh' love intere Definitely one of the lesser P.D.

Main character Dalgliesh was annoyingly self-righteous, distant and superior, but the writer never showed that in a negative light. Dalgliesh' love interest and pals were also without any flaws. At the same time those considered antagonists in the story seemed to be without redeeming qualities. Nothing awfully inventive about the plot either, the ending was an anti-climax, and the motivation behind the deaths was not built in a fully convincing manner. The pace seemed to drag on throughout. There were ramblings about religion and morals that felt as if James just wanted to force a few of her own random musings into a murder mystery. I found myself leafing through many parts of the unnecessarily long 600-page book. I used to quite enjoy the timeless, escapist environment of James' books, but now it felt she's unable to keep up with the times. It all felt very old-fashioned for a book published just a decade ago. It could've easily been set at any time in the last century, if there hadn't been a few jarring mobiles thrown in. However, what especially bothered me was the outdated and rather bizarre stance on morality. A female is considered unfeeling and selfish for having casual sex, while everyone feels sorry for a man who went to prison for \"just\" (!) fondling children. I kept waiting for the molester to get his comeuppance; that would've been a nice twist, to prove even holier-than-thou Dalgliesh wrong. But, it never came, so there was no need for that disturbing \"kind-hearted molester\" aspect to be there - except the author seemingly trying to make her own opinion known. I just thought that kind of an opionion could've been left out from a book like this. I'm a very sporadic James reader, but this book still was frustrating, since some of her work is excellent. Now this book makes me wonder if Mrs. James - who was 80 when she wrote it - should retire and tour grand English estates instead. ...more Goodreads needs another rating between \"I hated it\" and \"It was ok\". I can't at all recommend this book, but I don't wish it destroyed either. (And yes, there are some books I wish destroyed!) I would like to be able to say I liked Death in Holy Orders because I've seen Masterpiece Theatre productions of PD James' work on PBS and thought them really good.

I really like her Dalgliesh character, and I love a convoluted mystery. **spoiler alert** But, though the book has a total of 4 murders to solve, it also included a few plot-holes, too many unsympathetic characters, weak theology (for a work about a religious college) and an emotionally removed MC who, even when he does get upset, James can't bring us into his head and into the story so that we feel what he feels. And what I especially didn't care for in this book was that the wrap-up is given in a letter of confession from the killer. Oh, the police had solved the case, but with the letter any emotional involvement we the reader had is seriously diluted. Other quibbles: the first death is a purported mystery from page 3, but it turns out to be perfectly straightforward. Until the letter, the reader is never absolutely sure it couldn't have been someone else. Death #4 is just left hanging; we never find out if it was a murder, if it tied into the other deaths, or even exactly what happened when the person was killed. And (on a personal note), I think James' writing style has problems. ...more How will you rate a mystery/crime fiction written beautifully but CLEARLY lacking in the motive for crime!!

Though again for my irritation he took too long to solve the crime and that too without zest,charm or even wit. Hopes he gets better in the next.

I\u2019ve begun making a point of picking one up whenever a previous book disappoints me in terms of characterisation \u2013 to prove to myself that I\u2019m not just being picky, that it\u2019s possible to infuse any genre with individuals who are neither lazily portrayed, nor overplayed to compensate. There are other female crime writers who are just as strong in this area, but I\u2019m on a P. D. James kick just now, because she also plots and instils atmosphere wonderfully, as well; in this book, the sadness and isolation were layered with beautiful subtlety. Death in Holy Orders seemed a little long-winded in places (there seemed to be more \u2018middle\u2019 to this book than was strictly necessary) but a very rewarding read. ...more Un giallo classico, ambientato in un luogo solitario e apparentemente tranquillo.

Poeta e uomo sensibile, non rientra nello stereotipo del poliziotto invincibile. \u00c8 solamente un uomo, con i suoi difetti e i suoi pregi, che lo rendono un personaggio umano e apprezzabile. La scrittura, particolarmente elevata, contribuisce a costruire una storia di tensione pi\u00f9 che altro psicologica, dove le emozioni vengono suscitate dall\u2019atmosfera cupa e densa di oscurit\u00e0 del paesaggio invernale. Le descrizioni sono molto accurate e scavano nella personalit\u00e0 di ogni personaggio e nella storia del seminario. Un luogo che fin dall\u2019ottocento si \u00e8 impregnato di ricatti, segreti, tradimenti. La soluzione arriver\u00e0 inaspettata, mentre la tensione creata dall\u2019intrigante intreccio di relazioni e sete di potere si scioglier\u00e0 in un crescendo di suspense. ...more Overall, I tend to like P.D.

Essentially, everyone is ok with this, and brush it off, as it wasn't that bad. It was mentioned many times, and the only person who was upset at the situation ended up beign murdered and everyone was happy about it. Ridiculous. I don't care if this is her opinion, or she's taking the opinion of the old church, but it is not acceptable in any way, shape of form. This book would have a higher rating (most likely 3 stars) if the molesting story had been reasonably addressed. As it wasn't, I found it affected the whole story for me. ...more A young, unpopular ordinand at St. Anselm's Theological College on the Suffolk coast dies under a collapsed mound of sand.

The unravelling of the mystery is perhaps a teeny bit disappointing, as the murderer hadn't really been on my radar screen until near the end of the book. But who cares? People read mysteries for the buildup. I thought this was one of James's better ones. Fawn count: 5 ...more I thoroughly enjoyed this book, so much that it was hard for me to put down most nights.

In this particular novel, Adam Dalgliesh heads to St Anselm's, a remote theological college, to investigate the death of a young man who was enrolled there because his father wasn't happy with the results of the previous investigation. As always with PD James, a few more murders happen and who it could be is up in the air until the last couple of chapters. Great book - and a must read for PD James and fans of British mysteries. ...more I enjoyed this more than the only other Dalgliesh murder I've read. I'm sure it's because I was prepared for P.D.
