Notice that he had to cover up his hands and face to keep the constant barrage of biting insects at bay. As Theodore Roosevelt lay on his cot in the Amazonian jungle burning up with fever, yellow pus leaking from his leg, and his mind wandering aimlessly through the corridors of his memories he would recite over and over the opening stanza of Kubla Khan . I can only imagine how terrifying that was to his traveling companions, especially his son Kermit, to see the Bull Moose nearly at the end of his tether. So how did Teddy end up in such circumstances? Well it all starts with the Republican primaries for the 1912 Presidential election. Roosevelt had finished up William McKinley\u2019s term after McKinley was assassinated at the World\u2019s Fair in 1901. Roosevelt had then won the presidency as the top man at the ticket in 1904. In 1908 he graciously decided to step down and not run for another term as president. He supported his good friend William Howard Taft for the presidency.<---F> Taft won</---F>. Teddy had a falling out with Taft probably having more to do with personality conflicts than political differences. He went to the party and asked them to replace Taft with himself for the 1912 election. They refused, but they assured him he would be their candidate in 1916. Teddy is not one to wait. He formed the Bull Moose Party and decided he was going to run against everyone. His own party, the Democrats, and anyone else who wanted to jump in the race. While campaigning in Milwaukee, Wisconsin he was shot by a saloonkeeper named John Schrank. John Schrank the man who shot Roosevelt. Roosevelt decided that since he wasn\u2019t coughing up blood that instead of going to hospital he would deliver his campaign speech in his blood soaked shirt. Roosevelt x-ray showing the bullet in his chest. If you just heard a CLANK that was Roosevelt\u2019s brass balls. The 1912 election turned out to be an unusual one with four candidates splitting up the vote. Woodrow Wilson Democrat 6,296,284 votes 41.8% of the vote. Theodore Roosevelt Progressive 4,122,721 votes 27.4% of the vote William Howard Taft Republican 3,486,242 votes 23.2% of the votes Eugene V. Debs Socialist 901,551 votes 6% of the votes Roosevelt frankly couldn\u2019t believe he lost. Whenever anything goes wrong he has to figure out a way to hit the reset button to keep from going into funk, and one of the best ways for him to do so is to do something dangerous like take a trip down to South America and see if the Amazon could kill him or make him whole again. He was 55 years old in 1913. CLANK! Kermit Roosevelt on the Amazon His son Kermit had just become engaged to a young socialite, so he wasn\u2019t thrilled at the prospect of a long excursion into the jungle, but he could not let his father go without him. Kermit was already suffering from malaria when the trip began and fought it all the way down the river. Initially they were supposed to take a relatively easy trip down a known byway, but when Colonel Rondon came to Roosevelt and presented an alternative idea, surveying an unknown river, can\u2019t you see the brimming excitement in those myopic eyes and the big smile with all those tombstone teeth? CLANK! CLANK!! He hopped up and down thus the double clank. Everything went wrong. They brought too much stuff. They brought the wrong stuff. They hired the wrong people. On top of all that: \u201dCompared with the creatures of the Amazon, including the Indians whose territory they were invading, they were all--from the lowliest camarada to the former president of the United States--clumsy, conspicuous prey.\u201d They named the river after Roosevelt. He insisted that The River of Doubt was a much better name, but showing diplomacy graciously accepted the honor. With him is Captain Rondon. What I\u2019m struck by in this picture is how thin Roosevelt looks. The River of Doubt turns out to be a nemesis capable of swallowing them all without leaving a single trace. It is beautiful though, and certainly majestic. \u201dIf Roosevelt and his men could have soared over the rain forest like the hawks that wheeled above them, the River of Doubt would have looked like a black piece of ribbon candy nestled in an endless expanse of green. Here, at the start of its tortuous journey northward, the river was so tightly coiled that at times it doubled back on itself, and in every direction the jungle stretched--dense, impenetrable, and untouched--to the horizon.\u201d Hidden beneath the canopy and beneath the roiling waters of the river are hazards that are just waiting, patiently, for someone or something to make a mistake. \u201dOf the approximately twenty piranha species, most prefer to attack something their own size or smaller, and they are happy to scavenge, especially during the rainy season, when there is more to choose from. However, their muscular jaws and sawlike teeth, which look as if they have been filed to tiny spear points, can make quick work of a living creature of any size and strength, from a waterbird to a monkey, to even an ox. During telegraph line expeditions, Rondon and his soldiers regularly offered up their weakest ox to a school of piranha so that the rest of their herd could safely cross the river.\" Anybody for a quick swim? Rondon lost a good friend who was attacked by piranhas. When they found him all that was left on his skeleton was the feet in his boots. There are Indian tribesmen of course, not friendly. These blundering explorers stirring up the jungle probably were perceived more as an irritation than a real threat, but still they were \u201cother\u201d which could also mean that they were on the menu. \u201dThe most important rule of cannibalism within the tribe was that one Cinta Larga could not eat another. The tribe drew a clear distinction between its own members and the rest of mankind, which they considered to be \u2018other\u2019--and, thus, edible.\u201d Try not to look sooo hungry when you are looking at me. The survey expedition soon becomes low on food. The river demands carbs as they have to negotiate brutal rocky rapids that require their canoes and their supplies be hand lowered down to a calmer section of the river. When they needed more food for energy is when they had the least to eat. Teddy cuts his leg trying to help with the canoes and it happens to be the leg that was crushed in a traffic accident more than a decade before. I would assume that blood flow was not the best through that leg which makes it harder for the body to fight infection. On top of the infection that quickly starts oozing from his leg is the assassin\u2019s bullet still in his chest. It is not completely healed and continues to pull down his immune system. He is perfectly positioned to die. He offered to pull the trigger, Hemingway style. CLANK! He wouldn\u2019t be carried. He was going to walk out of that jungle. CLANK! \u201dRoosevelt realized that if he wanted to save Kermit\u2019s life he would have to allow his son to save him. \u2018It came to me, and I saw that if I did end it, that would only make it more sure that Kermit would not get out. For I know he would not abandon me, but would insist on bringing my body out, too. That, of course, would have been impossible. I knew his determination. So there was only one thing for me to do, and that was to come out myself.\u2019\u201d Could you toss your hair Candice? Beautiful. Now look over here. Lovely. Candace Millard is not only lovely, but also a wonderful writer. She placed me there in the jungle with Teddy and his camaradas. I didn\u2019t trail my hands in the water and in generally just kept all my digits as close to my body as possible. I could feel the desperation as one thing after another continued to go wrong, stacking the deck against them. It was an adventure too arduous for a 55 year old man, but Teddy needed a victory. A victory that would sooth the pain of his defeat in 1912. He needed something larger than life that would put the sparkle back in his eye when he came home and told everyone just how close to death he came. The Amazon never did let go of him; in fact, when he died in 1919 it was from complications associated with his trip down The River of Doubt. I also highly recommend Millard\u2019s book on President Garfield.

I am three books through Robert Caro\u2019s as-yet-unfinished quadrilogy on Lyndon Johnson, and just finished the second book of Edmund Morris\u2019s trilogy on Theodore Roosevelt. Because Morris and Caro are both giants in their field, I have found myself comparing the two sets of books. Every time I do, it seems, I have placed Caro\u2019s The Years of Lyndon Johnson above Morris\u2019s life of Theodore Roosevelt. The thing is, I could never really explain why. I mean, both books are expansive in scope; are thoroughly researched; and, most important, are expertly written. They are books that you can get lost in. (<---B>And not the bad kind of lost, like with Joyce</---B>). The other day, it finally hit me what Caro has that Morris does not: a vulnerable subject. I connect to history through people. Names, dates, the macro sweep of events. All these things are important. But what makes history great, what makes it a fascinating subject, worthy of our study, is the people who lived, shaped, and changed that history. History comes down to men and women who are not too dissimilar from you and me. Thus, what I look for in a great history book is the ability to empathize with the personages. In order to have empathy for a person, there has to be some level of intimacy. And to have intimacy, you need vulnerability. (In other words, you need the ability to walk a mile in another\u2019s shoes. You can\u2019t do that unless that person is willing to let you borrow their shoes). Lyndon Johnson is vulnerable, flawed, and strikingly human. There is no veneer; no projection. It is easy for me to empathize with Johnson, because so many of his traits are common (and perhaps familiar to us): ambition; glad-handing; the occasional corner-cutting; and the shouting at subordinates while on the toilet. Johnson was no distant oracle. Rather, he was a tortured, foul-mouthed Hamlet. Teddy Roosevelt is just the opposite. Throughout his life, in his letters and papers, he was preparing his legacy. He bounded through the first two-thirds of his life with irrepressible optimism, energy, and strength. Nothing got to him. His contemporaries could not imagine him ever dying. This kind of projection \u2013 one of invulnerability \u2013 makes empathy difficult. As good as Morris\u2019s biography is (and it\u2019s very good), I have not yet felt close to Roosevelt. I have not yet sensed that I know him as a human being. That\u2019s what Roosevelt wanted to show the world. He was, after all, the man who once delivered a speech right after getting shot by a would-be assassin. I\u2019ve a bullet in my chest? Bully! Whatever you project, however, is just a projection; as Auden wrote, \u201ctime will have its fancy.\u201d <---A>Candice Millard</---A>\u2019s The River of Doubt is the story of Theodore Roosevelt shaking hands with mortality. It brings a titanic figure down to human dimensions. This is not the puffed-chest Roosevelt who, at the Sorbonne, elegantly sneered at \u201cthe critic\u201d who does not enter the arena, who is a \u201ccold and timid soul\u201d who knows not victory nor defeat. Instead, this is a Roosevelt starving and wracked with fever and dysentery, lying in a sweltering jungle, contemplating suicide. The River of Doubt recounts Roosevelt\u2019s 1913-14 expedition down an unexplored South American river: the titular River of Doubt. The thousand-mile river, preceded by a months-long overland journey, was fraught with dangers: Indians, snakes, rapids, piranhas, insects, disease and starvation. All this was compounded by poor planning, dubious food selection, faulty assumptions (that, for one, the expedition would be able to supplement its rations by hunting), and unwieldy dugout canoes. The environment these men entered was almost impossibly lethal. Even a scrape on the leg could lead to a life-threatening infection. The heat, the rains, the mud; the exhausting portages; the lingering malaria; the gross bugs; the incessant mosquitoes. Every step in the journey was like a scene out of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom , except there was no wisecracking Chinese sidekick to lighten the mood. Roosevelt\u2019s expedition was borne out of his disappointing electoral defeat in 1912, when he\u2019d run as a third-party candidate against William Howard Taft (his former mentee) and Woodrow Wilson. As Millard points out, Roosevelt\u2019s prescription for crushing personal setbacks was vigorous physical activity. (As I intimated above, he was not the kind of man who could simply talk about his feelings). Three months after handing the keys of the White House over to Wilson, Roosevelt was invited to give a series of lectures in Argentina. He used this trip as an opportunity to indulge his passion for naturalism. With the help of the American Museum of Natural History, Roosevelt put together a modest trip. This was to be a chance to put some bugs in a jar, blast away at unsuspecting wildlife with a shotgun, and sit beneath the stars. However, once Roosevelt arrived, his plans changed. Instead of poking around the Amazon, Roosevelt and his expedition would attempt to be the first white people to descend the unmapped River of Doubt. Traveling with Roosevelt was his son, Kermit, a lovesick young man of exceptional energy and endurance; Father Zahm, a racist old priest who wanted the porters to carry him along the trail; George Cherrie, an explorer and naturalist; and Colonel C\u00e2ndido Mariano da Silva Rondon, Brazil\u2019s most famous explorer, a man so devoted to peace between Brazilians and Indians that he refused to let his men defend themselves if attacked. Of these characters, we learn the most about Kermit. This is due to his prolific writing, especially his lovesick letters to his fianc\u00e9, Belle. Unlike his father, Kermit wasn\u2019t stingy about expressing his feelings in the most maudlin manner possible. Kermit had had a challenging childhood. Teddy Roosevelt was something of a Tiger Mother, except instead of forcing his son to play the piano, he made Kermit endure various wilderness challenges without complaint. Millard does a fine job shading Kermit, and showing his many sides: the Kermit who wrote silly love notes, the Kermit who carefully watched over his father, and the darker Kermit who caused a man\u2019s drowning without batting an eye. We learn a bit less of Roosevelt himself, whose own personal writings were more about the landscape than his interior monologue. Roosevelt\u2019s arc is mostly seen secondhand, by the other men in the expedition. Oddly enough, it is a little satisfying to see the blustering Roosevelt brought to his knees and forced to accept that some of life\u2019s challenges required more than a can-do attitude. Colonel Rondon, the co-leader of the expedition, shares the stage with Roosevelt for most of the trip. He is a colorful character in his own right (and my favorite part of The River of Doubt ): iron-willed, supremely disciplined, thoughtful and driven. Teddy Roosevelt is a pretty interesting guy, and it means something to say that Rondon does not wilt in Roosevelt\u2019s shadow. The real character, though, (and let me just slip into my clich\u00e9 pants) is South America\u2019s fatal environment. In Millard\u2019s telling, the whole of the jungle is a living creature, each thing \u2013 each plant, tree, insect, and blade of grass \u2013 engaged in an epic battle for survival. Millard spends a lot of time describing the symbiotic relationships that web the South American jungle. She also devotes ample time to all the terrifying beasts that awaited the expedition. Wild boar. Jaguar. Coral snake. And a tiny transparent catfish called the candiru. When it comes to parasitizing people, a very rare occurrence, the candiru\u2019s modus operandi is to enter through an orifice \u2013 from a vagina to an anus\u2026The potential danger for the men on the River of Doubt came not just when they swam in the river but even when they urinated in its shallow waters. Instances of candirus parasitizing people are rare, but in the one case in which a doctor fully documented his removal of a candiru from a young man, the victim\u2019s explanation of how the fish had entered his urethra was nearly as shocking as the fact that it was there at all\u2026In this case\u2026 the victim reported that, just before the attack, he had been standing in a river urinating, but the water had reached only his upper thighs, and his penis had not even touched the river, much less been submerged in it. The candiru, he claimed, had abruptly leapt out of the water, shimmied up his urine stream, and disappeared into his urethra. To which I might add: OWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW. Millard is a brisk, engaging writer (mostly, her writing doesn\u2019t call attention to itself; however, her one annoying tic is the overuse of the word \u201ccapricious\u201d to describe the river). She has a journalist\u2019s ability to explain and describe with utmost clarity, and to highlight interesting factoids. Her greatest achievement is melding the main story of the expedition with the many secondary and tertiary topics (such as ferocious fish, lurking cannibals, Brazilian history, and of course, candiru slipping into bodily orifices). For the most part, she manages to insert these illuminating, fascinating, sometimes gross discussions into the main narrative, without slowing things down, or making you feel like you\u2019re reading filler. Obviously you know, or should know, that Teddy Roosevelt doesn\u2019t die alongside the River of Doubt. Yet Millard maintains a thriller\u2019s tension, so that you are flipping pages as fast as you can read. The surprise isn\u2019t who lives or dies, but how these men were able to survive at all. Millard mostly avoids the temptation to paint Roosevelt\u2019s expedition as some exalted event. Yes, he mapped an unmapped river, and did so at great personal risk; however, in the scope of Roosevelt\u2019s life \u2013 not to mention the sweep of history \u2013 this is a footnote. Just a few years later, following the death of his son Quentin in World War I, and with his health broken from the River of Doubt, Roosevelt died in bed. I don\u2019t know if Roosevelt drew any lessons from his time on the river. In spirit, he was the same man after that he was before. When World War I broke out, he even pestered Woodrow Wilson to give him a combat command. Still, the journey down the River of Doubt, a metaphor so obvious is doesn\u2019t need explanation, must have given him some inkling that life was a precarious balance, and he could not swagger along it forever. The common thread of humanity, the one that connects us all, rich and poor, famous and infamous and not famous at all, is that we all must fall. It is the reason why people are as good as they are. So, there are lessons, here, whether Roosevelt learned them or not. Lessons about survival, endurance, and humanity. And also a big fat lesson about not canoeing down an unmapped South American river infested with piranhas and transparent catfish that can enter your bodily orifices. ...more This is one of those books that I both loved and hated.

I got really irritated with Teddy Roosevelt \u2014 I mean, the guy was a stubborn, egotistical ass \u2014 and I repeatedly wished I could travel back in time just to yell at him to GIVE IT UP AND GO HOME. Not that he would have listened. A quick summary: After Teddy Roosevelt left the American presidency in 1909, he went on an African safari. In 1912, he tried to run for president again, but he lost the nomination. Frustrated at home, he was looking for a new adventure and seized on an idea to cruise down the Amazon River. And this is where the problems started. First, Roosevelt did none of the planning for the trip. He left that to an incompetent priest, Father Zahm, who then farmed out the task to a store clerk named Anthony Fiala, who had never been to the Amazon and who was also famous for a disastrous North Pole expedition. So, right from the start, the expedition was not prepared to head to the Amazon. When they landed in South America, they had way too much baggage, much of it ill-suited for the rainforest. And then, Teddy Roosevelt got the terrible idea that instead of taking a pleasant boat trip down the Amazon River, which was a known route, it would be much more exciting to explore an unknown area, such as the River of Doubt. The arrogance. The ignorance. The na\u00efvet\u00e9. I could exhaust a thesaurus describing how stupid this plan was. There were too many men, not enough proper supplies and not enough proper boats. The entire expedition was doomed to be a failure the moment Roosevelt changed his mind. The book follows the group's overland march through the jungle to the River of Doubt, and then their slow and dangerous river descent. It's one of those stories where everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. There were some truly terrifying descriptions of the different ways the jungle can kill a person, such as malaria, poisonous snakes and insects, piranhas, and a hundred other predators. And don't forget the indigenous tribes of the region, who knew how to survive in the jungle and could have easily attacked and killed Roosevelt's group. One of the Brazilians guiding the expedition, Rondon, left peace offerings for the tribes whenever possible, which the author thinks is why the expedition was allowed to pass through the region (relatively) unharmed. So, did Roosevelt make it out of the jungle alive? Yes, but barely. He was injured and diseased, and he was so weakened by the journey that he died just a few years later. The book has a good epilogue, explaining that after everything Roosevelt had been through in the jungle, few believed his story when he got home. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure, survival stories or the history of the Amazon. There are also some great stories about what a manly-man Roosevelt was, and even though he comes across as an ass, I can understand why he was so admired and revered. But I wouldn't follow him into the jungle. I don't have a death wish. Funniest Line \"If you are shot by a man because he is afraid of you it is almost as unpleasant as if he shot you because he disliked you.\" \u2014 Theodore Roosevelt Favorite Quote \"Within such an intricate world of resourcefulness, skill, and ruthless self-interest, refined over hundreds of millions of years, Roosevelt and his men were, for all their own experience and knowledge, vulnerable outsiders. Most of the men were veteran outdoorsmen, and many of them considered themselves masters of nature. They were stealthy hunters, crack shots, and experienced survivalists, and, given the right tools, they believed that they would never find themselves in a situation in the wild that they could not control. But as they struggled to make their way along the River of Doubt, any basis for such confidence was quickly slipping away. Compared with the creatures of the Amazon, including the Indians whose territory they were invading, they were all \u2014 from the lowliest comrade to the former president of the United States \u2014 clumsy, conspicuous prey.\" ...more What a wonderful, adventurous journey Candice Millard takes us on with Teddy Roosevelt's amazing and disastrous expedition down an uncharted Amazonian river called the River of Doubt.

After reading a review by my amazing GR friend, LeAnne, I decided this was a book I needed to read sooner instead of later. I knew quite a bit about Mr. Roosevelt, including a bit about this final adventure in the Amazon. All my information came from a PBS special I saw a few years back on Theodore and Eleanor and Franklin. It was definitely enough to peek my interest in this American icon. He was far from anything we would expect to find in the White House these days. He was an adventurer who took his outdoor skills seriously, set standards very difficult to live up to, and held himself to a standard above anything he would have expected of anyone else. The trip down the Amazon is described in enough detail to make you squirm in your seat and wonder how anyone came out the other side, let alone a man of Roosevelt's age and physical condition. He managed to make an exploration that garnered the admiration of explorers of the caliber of Robert Peary, the first man to reach the North Pole, and to exit the Amazon jungle with the respect and goodwill of all the men who made the trip with him. In tribute to him, these are the words of Cherrie, a famed naturalist who was with Roosevelt on his trip down the River of Doubt: \"I have always thought it strange,\" Cherrie said quietly, \"since I had the opportunity to know him and know him intimately--because I feel that I did know him very intimately--how any man could be brought in close contact with Colonel Roosevelt without loving the man.\" What a statement that makes about the character of Roosevelt, that he could win the heart of such a man when the both of them must have been at their worst humor and suffering from hunger, illness and unimaginable discomforts. I couldn't help thinking how much we need a man of his conviction and confidence today. I don't think you would have worried about insincerity, or indecision, or dishonesty, or a president engulfed in fear, when Roosevelt was at the wheel. I'm guessing that even in a state of peril, Roosevelt would have made you feel safe. He was larger than life, because he was not afraid of it. [final thought: I tried to imagine a modern day president taking an assassin's bullet and standing up with the bullet still in him and making a speech, or any of our current former presidents heading off on such a dangerous adventure without having their security details in tow to clear the paths through the jungle for them. Nope can't do it.] ...more This book tells of a chapter of Theodore Roosevelt's life that was not widely known these days, at least before this book was published. After the failure of his Bull Moose party to carry him to a third term as president, T.R. went looking for adventure (probably in an effort to ward off depression). One thing led to another until he very nearly got himself, his son and others killed in the heart of the Amazon River basin. The dangers of the Amazon rain forest are so thoroughly described in this This book tells of a chapter of Theodore Roosevelt's life that was not widely known these days, at least before this book was published. After the failure of his Bull Moose party to carry him to a third term as president, T.R. went looking for adventure (probably in an effort to ward off depression). One thing led to another until he very nearly got himself, his son and others killed in the heart of the Amazon River basin. The dangers of the Amazon rain forest are so thoroughly described in this book that I'm convinced that the reader is more aware of the danger and trouble TR's party was in than the actual participants. Eventually their predicament is so bad that the reader can't see how they can possibly survive. Readers familiar with history will know that it's not yet time for TR to die. Nevertheless, the mystery finally presented by this book is, how in the world are they going to get out this fix alive? The real hero of this book, in my opinion, is C\u00e2ndido Rondon the Brazilian who was the real leader of the group. Roosevelt was more famous, but Rondon was the one who made it happen. He was and continued to be known for his lifelong support of the Brazilian indigenous populations. He believed it important not to kill the native peoples. It was an attitude not widely shared then in Brazil, and thus he was ahead of his time with his enlightened beliefs. One indication of the difficulties experienced by the expedition was that TR lost a quarter of his body weight (220 lbs to 165 lbs) in a two month time span.

Millard relates these events with a brisk pace, tense suspense and copious detail. Not only do we learn about Rossevelt's personality and character we also learn much about the Amazon's ecosystem, infectious diseases, and the myriad of dangerous creatures that inhabit the jungle.

I knew how it would end, but I didn't know how they were going to be to that end point. That mystery alone kept me turning the pages far into the night. The narrative was also well crafted, with only a few dull and overly long forays into depths of the diverse eco-system of the South American rainforest.

After reading River of Doubt, Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey, I can happily announce that I know much, much more about this phenomenal man. Like he's actually more closely related to Eleanor Roosevelt, who was his niece. But, don't let me fool you. This book isn't a biography of Teddy Roosevelt. Instead, Candice Miller, a National Geographic contributor, details one incredible year of his life - the year he decided to travel to the Amazon and risk all to charter a 600 mile previously unknown river: the Rio Duvida or River of Doubt. Miller doesn't limit her writing to being a travelogue. Instead, she carefully sets up the background story and motivation for his trip. Roosevelt had just lost his bid for a third term as President of the United States and in his humiliation, agreed to an acquaintance's suggestion for high adventure. The year was 1912 and the Amazon and it's many tributaries remained mostly unmapped and mysterious. Roosevelt was an advocate for \"the strenuous life\" so taking a year to rough it in the jungles of Brazil was not a big stretch for him personally. In spite of his own willingness, a man of his status and prestige does not just travel to the Amazon anonymously. His trip included a pre-adventure diplomatic tour through South America - a continent containing several countries who strongly disagreed with his foreign policy while president. It also included a large entourage in an attempt to ensure for this important man's safety. For a non-fiction book about a dead president, a jungle and river I've little desire to explore and a country I've never been to, I was sucked into this drama. Miller is an excellent writer and the story unfolds in a very readable way. There was no textbook or even National Geographic feel to it at all. The only time I got bored was when she included information about the Amazon's soil or the properties of sedimentation on the river. Both were absolutely necessary to completely understand the present dangers, but, still....soil. It's not very sexy. Highly recommend. A fascinating chapter in a fascinating man's life. ...more Non-fiction often gives me the yawns, but not this! Nope - 4.5 and totally unexpected.

He won re-election fair and square a few years later, was awarded the Nobel Prize for ending the Russian-Japanese war (I'd never even heard of that!), brought about New Deal programs to bring fairness to all, created National Parks, and way more. Basically, there is good reason that his profile is carved up there on Mt. Rushmore with Washington, Lincoln, and Jefferson. Roosevelt was practically worshipped, not just for his accomplishments, but for his attitude and enthusiasm. If you saw the family movie \"Night at the Museum\" then you saw Robin Williams play the role of Roosevelt. Yeah, it's just a fun kiddy movie, and I hope you'll forgive me for referencing it, but Williams did his homework to portray Roosevelt well. Full of life and kindness. We actually do not hear too much about his political past in this book, although we come to understand how he came to love nature and refused to buckle under physical hardship (he had severe asthma as a child). This tale focuses on the geographical exploration he co-led into a massive section of the unmapped, un-named, and unknown part of the Amazon River basin. The river they were to explore may or may not have been a tributary of the Amazon - nobody knew - and it was literally named the River of Doubt - \"Rio da D\u00favida.\" Unfortunately for Roosevelt, what started out as a trip to South America to make a few speeches and tour around the Amazon a bit turned into a horribly ill-prepared expedition organized by guys who either had only visited South America as a tourist or had never been south of the border (but had led a group to nearly starve to death on an expedition to the Arctic). Neither of them spoke a lick of Portuguese. The provisions packed by these men included cases of fancy mustard, spices, wine, cigars, olive oil, and other non-necessities that so overloaded the mules that when the creatures had to haul the supplies across a desert-like plateau, half the mules dropped dead. This first of many disasters began en route to the head waters of \"Rio da D\u00favida\" - they had not even begun the expedition yet! The remaining, but tottering mules bucked off even more cases. When the party crossed the initial arid region on muleback, they split into two groups - the forward party was to get most of the boats, surveying equipment, tents, cases of provisions, etc to the river before the expedition officers would arrive. As Roosevelt, his adult son Kermit, and others found as they followed, the route before them was littered with dead mules and random, unmarked boxes of supplies. Were they leaving behind books and mustard, or was it rice and beans? No idea. Until they started to unpack the boxes, the men had no idea the luxuries and non-life supporting doodads that had been carted in. Obviously, Roosevelt was given inaccurate information about the expedition up front, but upon realizing it, he was not about to back down. He loved adventure. He was aware that they had no idea the length of the River of Doubt, but only knew where it's headwaters were. The local expedition leader, Candido Rondon estimated as best he could the length of their journey but was ridiculously off in his guess. Those who did not die on the trip nearly starved to death and fought off injury, infection, malaria, dysentery, mosquitoes, coral snakes, cannibals, drowning, and a lot of misery. After the first five weeks, they didn't know if they would live to ever get out of the jungle. As it turned out, the river snaked back and forth on itself repeatedly and gouged through canyon after canyon, burst over rapids too frenzied for them to even contemplate, and worse. Their lightweight boats were taken by a handful of explorers who bailed out of the trip (or were fired), so Roosevelt's group of 19 had only DUGOUT TREES to travel 1000 miles of river. Look, I go kayaking every couple of weeks on calm water, and the description of what they had to go through - even having to cut down trees and carve out new dug-outs when their others were smashed to pieces - blows my mind. Beyond all this is that the former president of the United States was doing this! No bodyguards, no Secret Service - heck, no antibiotics. They weren't around back then! Roosevelt and his adult son, Kermit were seen practically as royalty and yet were out there trying to shoot monkeys in order to have the men not starve. Throw in septic infection, extreme fever, and surgery in the middle of the rainforest, and it is understandable why three men died. That no more than that did is miraculous. In sum, this story is totally fascinating, and by the author's clever interspersing excerpts of Roosevelt's trip diary, it is as if you have him \"live\" with you while reading. She has pieces of the letters written by others on the trip - during the expedition and after - so we are able to get inside the heads of the other officers, too. The camaradas' (porters) viewpoints can only be inferred by their courageous acts and description of them by the officers. The camaradas' compassion and respect for members of the expedition was such that they were willing to dig a grave in the middle of the jungle (with bare hands, as the shovels were gone) while the cannibalistic Cinta Larga Indians shadowed them.

This, after an overland route of several hundred miles just to get to the uncharted river of the expedition: After months of inattention, Roosevelt had now come face to face with the acute logistical shortcomings and rapidly escalating risks that his own casual approach to the expedition and its route had produced. Roosevelt, Rondon, and their men were about to begin the most difficult leg of their journey, but they were already at the limits of their endurance. As well as danger - this is an adventure story at its heart - there is also humor. At this early point in the Roosevelt-Rondon Expedition, the insects had already become the bane of the men's existence. On the morning of March 4, Cherrie woke up to find that the poncho that he had spread underneath his hammock the night before was \"literally alive with termites.\" Unfortunately for the expedition, termites swarm during the rainy season. The mass swarming may be an effort to increase their chances for reproducing, or it may better their odds for surviving their countless predators. Whatever the reason for this invasion, every man suffered because of it. The termites ate Cherrie's duffle bag, the red lining of Roosevelt's helmet, and even one leg of the former president' underwear. \"When the Colonel held them up for our inspection there was a shout of laughter,\" Cherrie recalled. \"But I don't believe he relished our mirth.\" I learned more about the Amazon rain forest than I thought interested me, and I found it fascinating. The obstacles to exploring this barely known river, and the methods the men found to overcome those obstacles were also fascinating. I came to know many of these men. Millard ends her story in what was, for me, a very emotional way. I have insufficient praise for this. ...more Theodore Roosevelt needed to lift his spirits after his defeat in the 1912 presidential election in a third-party run.

Theodore Roosevelt was accompanied by his son Kermit Roosevelt, the Brazilian explorer Colonel Candido Rondon, a naturalist, a doctor, and the camaradas who toiled as paddlers and porters. Rondon acted as the commander, and mapped the river. The expedition was poorly supplied with boats that were too heavy for paddling through the rapids. The River of Doubt was dangerous with poisonous snakes, piranhas, impassable rapids and waterfalls, the possibility of attack by Indians, and constant swarms of insects. The men were starving when they ran low on provisions, and were fighting malaria and other infections. Although there were many people on this journey to admire, it is questionable if they would have survived without the leadership of Colonel Rondon. The book is an adventure story as well as a historical account of part of Roosevelt's life. The author, a former writer and editor for National Geographic, impressed me with her nature writing as well.

But, I'll just share Sterling Archer's sentiments which sum things up pretty well: Not only are they ill-prepared for the physical environment, but the crew of characters is bound for culture clash from the start. Anyone who has ever ventured into the wilderness with a group of others knows just how much truth there is to the following: A man may be a pleasant companion when you always meet him clad in dry clothes, and certain of substantial meals at regulated intervals, but the same cheery individual may seem a very different person when you are both on half rations, eaten cold, and have been drenched for three days\u2014sleeping from utter exhaustion, cramped and wet.

Opinions become opinionated views if one is not open to reinspecting them or even changing them from time to time. For years and years I have preferred fiction (novels actually) to nonfiction. My only exceptions to this opinion were biographies and memoirs about writers and artists. In recent months my reading groups have been choosing more nonfiction. I have moaned and groaned, but I always read the chosen book. I have also been reading some history as research for my own memoir. The upshot of all this is that I have changed my opinion or at least altered it. I can learn from nonfiction, but more to the point I can enjoy it. The River of Doubt did not change my opinion of Teddy Roosevelt, who has always seemed to me to have lived by an annoying ubermacho, war mongering creed. I got some insight into why that is in Candance Millard's book but I still feel that way. However, I also realized that I have a heretofore unadmitted weakness for extreme adventure tales, of which this book is a good example. In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt lost a presidential election and got depressed. He couldn't lead his country, he had no war to fight in, so he turned to his other love: exploration. Apparently, he had always used extreme physical challenges as an antidote for depression. A never before explored river in the heart of the Amazon jungle was just the ticket. While the story has its share of malaria, disgusting creatures, infected injuries and low food rations, it is still a fascinating journey through the jungle. Roosevelt met his match in Brazilian explorer Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon, one of the toughest, most principled dudes I have ever met in any book. As these two alpha males duked it out, overcoming every possible barrier to making it down the river and back to civilization, the reader is there with them, their crew, the indigenous peoples, the piranhas, the monkeys and the bugs. Despite a couple of lulls in the narrative, the story rages on, as though the author were channeling Roosevelt. In fact, she herself spent time on what is now called Rio Roosevelt.

And that legacy of mapping the River of Doubt would today be little more than an unknown blip if not for this book. If you are well versed on the history of the Amazon and its peoples, and such creatures as candirus and botflies, a bit of fascination with this book may be lost, but the armchair traveler should still find much to admire. Millard uses over 100 sources (I'm anal, I counted them) including the diaries of the expedition members to tantalize us with facts of the expedition and the Amazon rainforest. I admit that it was a bit tedious to read over and over about encounters with rapids, but imagine actually having to traverse them! And, to do so in watercraft not suited for such purpose. I have encountered unexpected rapids created from mere boulders and seen canoes capsize. Frightening as it was, it was a walk in the park compared to this. We weren't starving, suffering from malaria, or carrying more than six-pack coolers and tennis shoes. This is the first book I've read about T.R. and it was an excellent place to start.

In addition to being a cowboy in the Dakotas, the NYC police commissioner, the Secretary of the Navy, the leader of the Rough Riders, the Medal of Honor winner, the driving force behind the Panama Canal, the founder of the Progressive Party, and an avid naturalist and conservationist given to rugged adventures in Africa and other locales, he also just happened to be the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, the first American winner of any of the Nobel prizes awarded in any category. Oh and, not to leave it out...President of the United States. But even that is just a small series of highlights from a life that incorporated many other interesting asides. Any author who writes a boring book about Teddy Roosevelt has no one to blame but him or her self. Luckily, Millard doesn\u2019t have to worry about that. \u201cThe River of Doubt\u201d really only focuses on one major event in Roosevelt\u2019s life, an Amazon adventure that occurred when he was fifty-five years old and had recently been defeated when his Progressive Party took on Woodrow Wilson and William Howard Taft in the presidential election. (Teddy actually beat Taft and is still the only third party candidate to come in second in an election.) Nonetheless, Roosevelt did not have a disposition suited to a leisurely retirement, and he was lured by an invitation to travel to South America to collect Amazonian species with naturalists hand-picked by the American Natural History Museum. With his son Kermit already working in Argentina, and his friend Father Zahm eager to put together the specifics of the expedition, Roosevelt took to the idea with gusto. He was supposed to travel a route that had already been charted and was well-known to South American explorers (though not without its perils \u2013 this is the Amazon, after all), but somehow, inexplicably, despite being ill-prepared and possibly ill-suited to the rigorous demands of the challenge, he was talked into charting a murky, untraveled enigma of a river in the middle of Brazil that was thought to be a thousand-mile tributary of the Amazon. El Rio Duvida. The River of Doubt. An apt name for a river that may or may not exist in its expected form, even according to the man who discovered it, Brazil\u2019s most famous explorer, Candido Rondon - the same man who would be making the journey with the former President - as his co-commander. At this point in the book, as the journey begins, we have all the elements of a proper adventure story. We have our heroic commanders, Roosevelt and Rondon, we have their hard-working right hand men, Kermit (Roosevelt\u2019s son) and Lyra (Rondon\u2019s able assistant), we have a variety of unique characters: the naturalists Cherrie and Miller, the Arctic explorer Anthony Fiala, the bumbling, self-aggrandizing busybody Father Zahm, an assortment of noble camareras, and the bad apple of the bunch, a hired camarera named Julio Lima, who brought a threatening element of deceit and sociopathy to this already dangerous trek. From here on out, the book read more like a gripping adventure novel than an actual event in history. Anyone who has read \u201cThe Lost City of Z\u201d (highly recommended, by the way) or any other accounts of Amazonian exploration, will recognize the unique struggles and perils of that part of the world. A small cut, a minor injury, anywhere else on the globe is often merely an annoyance. In the Amazon, it can mean imminent death. I often watch a cable show called \u201cI Shouldn\u2019t Be Alive,\u201d featuring real people who have found themselves in dire circumstances \u2013 out in nature \u2013 from which they should not have emerged intact. There is usually an element of extreme bad luck, even an \u201cApollo 13\u201d\u2013like series of harrowing occurrences that contribute to the ordeals these poor sods endure - and yet somehow they survive. Several of these episodes, as expected, have taken place in the Amazon. I sometimes watch the show and think, \u201cI could have survived out in that desert\u2026or on that mountain\u2026\u201d but I know in my heart, I would never survive the South American jungle. Infection, swarms of insects, parasites, bacteria, and enemies from all parts of the jungle and its waters attracted by blood, by sweat, by commotion, can kill you at any moment. Hostile tribes, venomous snakes, cayman, jaguar, piranha, were all far less worrisome to Roosevelt\u2019s band of explorers than the constant bouts of dysentery, malaria and various other ailments from which the party suffered throughout their journey. Add to that, meager and dwindling food rations that threatened constant starvation and excruciating portages through challenging terrain \u2013 or churning rapids - for which they had the wrong transport, tools and supplies, and you have a party that should have ended in complete disaster. Yes, some tragic occurrences took place on the voyage, (Roosevelt very nearly died, for example, and a couple of others did actually perish on the trip), but for the most part, it was an absolute miracle of luck coupled with endurance and teamwork that triumphed in the end. The River of Doubt is called the Rio Roosevelt to this day. The adventure that nearly killed him also cemented Roosevelt\u2019s staggering legacy by making him a man who put a previously uncharted river on the map. In these pages, Roosevelt lives up to his impetuous, \"no holds barred\" persona. And for that reason, some of his decisions seem foolhardy, some of his parenting skills seem rather questionable at times, and his lack of regard for safety is truly troubling. But, he also lived a life unlike any other in history, and that doesn't happen by playing it safe. Millard captures Teddy's spirit for all time in this riveting book set along the banks of The River of Doubt. ...more The River of Doubt is non-fiction at its best. First of all, the story is amazing. The whole thing reads like a dungeon crawl through a jungle scenario, but it actually happened! Throughout the book, as the men struggle with leaky canoes, predators on land and in the river, cannibals (really!), constant insects and bacteria, discontent among the party itself, and their quest to go down a river that no one has ever gone down before, Millard puts in back stories for everyone so that you really car The River of Doubt is non-fiction at its best.

All of which takes me to another of non-fiction's (and this book's) strengths: education through entertainment. Frankly, I didn't know much about Teddy Roosevelt before I read this and now I know that he was so hardcore. He was born with severe asthma and determined to never let his body slow him down. So, he didn't. And, along the way, he became one of the most vital and athletic men of his generation. Now, as amazing as this book is, and as astonishing as it was that some of the men even made it, I just kept thinking what a waste of human life the whole thing was. If these men had never gone down the river, I believe mankind would have eventually mapped it anyway. With satellite technology, improvements in medicine and communications, we would have gone down the river and maybe not lost anyone. It reminded me of Rondon's extreme losses when he stretched telegraph wire across Brazil's interior. A couple of months after he completed this monumental task, with the loss of hundreds of soldiers, pack animals, and native Brazilians, the telegraph became outdated. I understand that he didn't know that this was going to happen when he put forth such effort to accomplish it, but it all just seems like a waste in hindsight. I don't know what makes men and women determine how to live their lives and decide what sorts of losses are acceptable during their completion, but I don't think that I could have lived with myself if I had been in charge of that expedition. I would have been forever haunted by the men who drowned or lost their lives to disease, native attacks, whatever. I guess I'm saying that if it had been me, The River of Doubt would have remained doubtful... at least for a time. To my mind, the main tragedy of this story, beyond the obvious losses, is what eventually happens to Kermit, Roosevelt's son. He steps up to challenges far beyond the normal in the Amazon but then his life seems to completely fall apart. I felt very sorry for him- that he couldn't puzzle out a way to live a normal life with such a larger than life father figure. I guess that could be true of all of the President's children, no matter what time period they lived in. We've all heard of George Washington, but whatever happened to his kids? Who knows...

That book also gave us a portrait of one of the four presidents on Mount Rushmore, in that case Thomas Jefferson, as well as telling us one of the greatest stories of exploration. I have to admit having recently read Ambrose\u2019s book, that left me less impressed with Milliard. The Lewis and Clark expedition is of course the bigger, more important story, and it's a subject that brought out the best in Ambrose, and though her book is very readable, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a strong prose stylist, and the book doesn\u2019t compare with the best works about exploration and survival or nature I\u2019ve read. But that\u2019s to raise a perhaps unfairly high bar. And by quite a few measures, this is a strong book. I came into the book knowing little of Theodore Roosevelt, other than knowing he was a thorough-going imperialist and well, war-monger militaristic. I\u2019d have said it was only appropriate that his favorite expression was \u201cbully.\u201d This book, though it doesn\u2019t deny that aspect of Roosevelt, does also show his much more appealing side both as naturalist and a man imbued with more that his own share of undaunted courage. Milliard in the beginning of the book quoted someone describing Roosevelt: \u201cWhen he came into the room it was as if a strong wind had blown the door open.\u201d And she ends with the tribute of a fellow member of the expedition, who said he couldn\u2019t understand \u201chow any man could be brought in close personal contact without Colonel Roosevelt without loving the man.\u201d And after reading this book I could understand why. Milliard also paints a vivid picture of Candido Rondon, the co-leader of the expedition and one of \u201cBrazil\u2019s greatest heroes.\u201d And the book certainly does well in giving us a sense of a unique habitat. Milliard, who was an editor of National Geographic , is good at choosing the kinds of details that stick with you and gives you a sense of enormous scales. Such as how the Amazon has over 3,000 different species of fish compared to the around 375 of the Missouri and Mississippi combined. And yes, she gives you a description of some of the dangers you might expect--alligators, piranhas, malaria-bearing mosquitoes, hostile natives (who happen to be cannibals.) Although I think if I\u2019m likely to have nightmares, it\u2019ll be inspired by her tales about a species of Amazon river fish called the candiru . Really... don\u2019t ask. It\u2019s a fast and informative read, so certainly if tales of exploration and history at all interest you, this would be worth giving a chance. ...more Part political thriller, part Biography, part Saturday-afternoon adventure serial, part ecology lesson, Candice Millard's \"The River of Doubt\" has a little something for everyone.

Ah, the beauty of Book Club. I really enjoyed learning about Theodore Roosevelt's journey down an uncharted Amazon river in the early 1900's. Some years ago, it was the fashion among some of the public intellectuals I followed to bemoan that psychotropic drugs had taken a toll on genius. That men and women who might, in past times, have dared mighty things would instead live lives of quiet contentment because paxil or ritalin or lithium or whatever took the edge off.

And I rolled my eyes. \"Know thyself,\" I believe, but I see nothing wrong with getting a little help to get through that dark night. This is a book about a man who kept his edge, right to the end. Who dared mighty things. Who accomplished mighty things. Whose dark night lurked, as close to his breast as the lethal dose of morphine he traveled with. Whose brother and son committed suicide. Who abandoned his daughter when his beloved wife died, because he *needed* to outrun \"black care\" that otherwise might have drowned him. Just like the river he helped map as a last heroic act. A last heroic act that contributed directly, the author hints, to his own death. This book did not make me like TR more. The reflective hegemonic impulses, the causal racism (albeit less than some in his company), the willingness to walk away from those who had a call on his love and support all left me vaguely disappointed, though I know he was better than he had to be. Nor does it make me roll my eyes a little less at those who bemoan the pharmacopeia. But man, he dared mighty things, right up to the end. Gotta respect. ...more<+++>The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey</+++>", "Title": "The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey"},
