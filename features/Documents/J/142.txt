That said, since the author skims through a big chunk of the latter part of Katherine's life and \"The King's Great Matter\", I wouldn't recommend this for newbies as you'll be scratching your head at the end wondering what in the heck you missed. Just be warned, this is Tudor history PG style so expect historical accuracy at your own peril... In this book, Gregory purports that the marriage between Catalina (Katherine) of Spain and Arthur Tudor was a love match and their union was most definitely consummated - a secret they kept from everyone. When Arthur realizes he'll not survive the sweating sickness, he commands Catalina to marry his younger brother Henry, so that she can still become Queen of England as they'd always dreamed. Catalina is determined to stay *constant* to her beloved's commands, but there's a lot of political turmoil ahead of her, especially over the fact of whether the marriage was consummated, \"I shall keep my promise. I shall be constant to my husband and to my destiny. And I shall plan and plot and consider how I shall conquer this misfortune and be what I was born to be. How I shall be the pretender who becomes queen.\" \"At Arthur's request I told the greatest lie a woman has ever told, and I will tell it to the very grave...He asked me to say that we had never been lovers and he commanded me to marry his brother and be queen...I was constant to my promise.\" But you all know the *rest of the story* so I'll not rehash it one more time, I'm just here to discuss the reading experience. Whether or not Katherine and Arthur consummated the marriage or not is a subject of debate and despite my previous conviction that Katherine spoke the truth about it during \"The King's Great Matter\", I was willing to keep an open mind (kind of). However, I didn't buy into the twu wuv fowever between Arthur and Catalina, nor did I buy into Henry VIII's portrayal as a bit of an ignorant dolt with no business sitting on the throne of England, \"He is bright and clever, perhaps even as quick witted as Arthur. But where Arthur had been trained to think, had been educated as a king from birth, they let this second son slide by on his charm and his ready tongue.\" Bah. Worse yet, towards the end the author appears to run out of steam (and page count) and makes a last minute push to finish in a big hurry as Katherine's latter years as queen and the whole business of \"The King's Great Matter\" is barely touched upon. Add to that the switches to the first person narrative (Katherine's) appear much too often and become increasingly annoying and soporific. Seriously, did we need to have her recount actual dialog with others, thus telling us what's happened instead of using the third person and showing us? As for Katherine's voice itself, she's very full of herself and her own self-importance and makes for a rather unsympathetic main character, particularly over her disdain for Henry VIII. Then there's the portrayal of Henry VII. Why, oh why does he always have to be portrayed lusting after the main female character from his very first sight of her? The book started off all right, when the switches to Katherine's narrative were short and well spaced, but by the end I was nodding off at them and was praying for the book to end, and I'd only recommended it for PG fans only. If you are looking for a well rounded, historically accurate look at Katherine of Aragon I suggest you look elsewhere. Oh, and before anyone gets in a tizzy as to why this non-PG fan decided to read another, this is for a group read for the European Royalty Group at Goodreads. I expect lively discussions. FTC disclosure. I obtained this book from my county library. ...more I'm going to start out by saying 1) I love historical fiction and 2) I loved Margaret George's, The Autobiography of Henry VIII with notes by his fool Will Sommers (one of my fave books of all time).

I've read the Other Boleyn Girl, I've read Elizabeth I by Rosamund Miles to learn about the time after Henry VIII, etc. Therefore I was really looking forward to learning more about Henry's first wife, Katherine of Aragon. The Constant Princess, is the story of Katherine of Aragon or Catalina, Infanta of Spain. It covers Catalina's childhood in Spain, her betrothal to Arthur (Henry's older brother), their marriage, his death, her agonizing wait to convince the King of England that marrying her to his 2nd son was the best solution to all the problems of dowry, etc, and the early years of her marriage to Henry and her rule as Queen of England. I found the beginning part about her childhood and her marriage to Arthur interesting. Her wait to marry Henry was as agonizing for the reader as it was for her (this section became very repetitive), and then the end was incredibly rushed. The author took 400 pages to cover her life up until her 3rd pregnancy and then skipped 13 years of her reign and the turmoil that became her relationship with Henry as he decided to divorce her and marry Anne Boleyn (I think that would have been very interesting material to read about) and then devoted 1 1/2 pages to the court hearing about annulling her marriage to Henry. It was almost as if she got tired of writing about her.... All in all I thought this book was just OK. ...more A very entertaining and engaging story, more lively than Jean Plaidy's Katherine trilogy. Even though I found Plaidy's books a bit on the dull side, I'm glad I read them to complement Gregory's take on the young Katherine.

Most of the HF I've read about Katherine shows her in her times of trial during her second marriage, where she comes across as a long-suffering and pious cow, an object of scorn and pity. Even as a younger girl, she comes off as a bit of a drip and killjoy, as if she was born old with the knees of a Carmelite nun. So it was a nice change to see the focus on Katherine as a child and young bride to the ill-fated prince Arthur Tudor, where she is vivacious, coquettish, and worldly in the ways of political matters (thanks to her parents' God-driven crusades, etc.) More familiar territory here is her early years of marriage to Henry up to her victory as temporary Regent against the Scots at Flodden Field. I thought the book was tightly written. There were narrative hooks, motifs, and character contrasts and comparisons that kept things connected: Arthur's post-coital requests for a story, the similarities between Isabella and Margaret Beaufort in their maternal austerity (and the effects of such on their respective children), the differing temperaments of Henry VII and VIII, Katherine's repeated reminders that she is Infanta, Princess, and Queen, etc. This last one at first struck me as annoying repetition, but by the end it fit in well with Katherine's devotion and loyalty to a temporal entity as much as she is a pious and devout Catholic. In fact, I thought by the book's close she was more dedicated to the body of England than the body of Christ. Her titles and her vows to Arthur became almost like a rosary prayer. Her earthly mission to be Princess of Wales and Queen of England had become the motivation for her soul and conscience, making The Big Lie completely justified and excusable. And I agree with the author that Katherine and Arthur most likely did consummate their marriage. It's a testament to Katherine's impeccable performance as Henry's queen that she was able to tell so implausible a lie and yet be believed for centuries. Of course, the only ones who know for sure are Arthur and Katherine, but it sure is fun to speculate. I also thought the switches to Katherine's viewpoint served the story well more often than it didn't. Sometimes the switch didn't add much, but I enjoyed seeing the actions through Katherine's eyes and the change in tone as she grows older, from innocent child to silly bride to resigned and disappointed yet wise Queen. Her time as Arthur's bride, where her musings seems really fatuous had a kind of poignancy. All her life she had been looked upon as an object for Spain's advancement, a tool for God's great plan, but with Arthur she became prized as a person, not merely a female vessel. Overall, a solid romantic read that complements Plaidy's more staid take on Katherine's youth and early adulthood. I would recommend both, as Plaidy's books have more detail on Katherine's family, particularly her mad sister Juana. I listened to the audiobook, narrated by Diana Bishop. I greatly enjoyed her interpretation and dramatic effects. She really got into Katherine's anguish, joy, and calm certainty and delivered it all with feeling. It certainly made repainting 3 rooms in the house pass more pleasantly! ...more If King Henry VIII's wives have any consolation, it is that they are remembered and honored far more in death than they were in life--there were six wives, and now there are dozens of books about them.

It is that perceived fault of hers that inspired Henry to seek sport in the arms of other women, and provided us with some salicious history. This is Katherine's story, and a sad one it is. The most remarkable element of this book is the emotions it evoked within me--I know the end of Queen Katherine and her dignified but fruitless life, and that colored my reading of the story. Katherine is not a particularly sympathetic character--she comes across as proud, arrogant, stubbourn, and far too dedicated to the belief that her God had intended her to be Queen of England. A misguided sense of destiny, along with a deathbed promise she made, led her into the lion's den, and once the lion bit down, she was caught for the rest of her life. In the book, Katherine was ambitious, and it led her to lie, decieve, even disregard her morals to achieve her goals. But even as ambitious and dishonest as she was, my heart still went out to her--at the end of the day, she was doing what she needed to do to survive, as well as maintain a sense of autonomy and dignity. Virtually all of the men in her life objectified, used, and disregarded her, and kept her in poverty for many years, and if Katherine lied a little--or a lot--to make a place for herself in the world, I think a lot of the readers can forgive her. I know I can. ...more Firstly, let me say that the thing I like about Philippa Gregory's novels is that she is an Historian, first and foremost.

Make no mistake, Catalina, this Katherine of Aragon is no pawn; she will remain steadfast to her own hopes and beliefs for her entire life. I now fully understand why she was so loved by the English people and I admit I am in awe of her myself. To me, Gregory's penultimate words for Katherine feel like a roar: \"This is me.

From childhood she was prepped for her queenly position; she grows up alongside a battlefield, in the splendid palace in Spain, until she is sent to be married to Arthur. And thus begins the life of the future Queen Katherine of Aragon. Despite their flaws, I rather enjoyed The Other Boleyn Girl and The \"A near-constant bore\" Catalina is the daughter of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain, the Spanish Infanta, betrothed to Arthur, Prince of Wales and heir apparent to the throne of England.

And thus begins the life of the future Queen Katherine of Aragon. Despite their flaws, I rather enjoyed The Other Boleyn Girl and The Queen's Fool . But while I liked Catalina more as a protagonist than either Mary Boleyn or Hannah Green, I found myself more irritated and bored with \"The Constant Princess\" than I was for either TOBG or TQF. NOTE: I'm no historian, so if you want to see how historically accurate this book is, you might want to seek another review. I think the first notable difference between TCP and TOBG or TQF is the switching of viewpoints. At first, I thought TCP would settle into the traditional third person past point of view (POV). But this time around, I think Gregory wanted to experiment and decided to intersperse the traditional 3rd person sections with ones where Catalina speaks in first person present--either as the Older Catalina or as the \"in-book present\" Catalina. I can see where an author would want to do this. The 3rd person POV is limited and cannot give the best insight into a character, not in the same way that a 1st person POV can (though a truly gifted author will be able to work around such challenges without resorting to changing POVs so drastically). To Gregory's credit, there were a few instances where the right balance was struck--the 1st person POV complimented and gave more insight into the 3rd person POV. Unfortunately, most of the time, these 1st person POVs just repeated the exact same things that were discussed in the 3rd person sections--or, worse, repeated the same point over and over again (\"I was Infanta of Spain\", \"I was born to be princess\", etc.). In the beginning, the switching of POVs made some sense; something would happen to Catalina, then she would think about what happened. But towards the end, it seemed the POVs changed willy nilly. First person present now had action scenes, scenes where actual dialogue between characters was exchanged. In fact, the number of 1st person POVs increased towards the end, as if Gregory was tired of writing in 3rd person. Since I opened with writing, let me continue in that vein for a bit more. There were no egregious spelling or grammatical errors that I could find. The text itself is a bit dry and bland (although I was stirred a bit when I read of Catalina's poverty). The absolute worst is the repetition coupled with the classic violation of \"show, don't tell\". Catalina repeats herself more times than I could count. She goes on and on about how she is the true Queen of England, the Infanta of Spain, born to be Queen, and on and on. Everyone refers to her as being \"constant\", in a heavy-handed way of referencing the title. Conversations that shouldn't last more than a couple of sentences are drawn out to several minutes of listening time (such as: Arthur and Catalina discussing plants, Arthur and Catalina whining about how hard their lives are, Catalina moaning about meeting a woman whose brother was put to death by Catalina's family). The absolute worst was the description of Allahmbra, which had to have gone on for 10+ minutes. I know that Gregory was trying to give her audience of how opulent it was, but having Catalina talk to the audience about how opulent it is is BORING and repetitive. Instead, have your characters DO something that shows the opulence. For the first time in a Gregory book, I actually didn't mind (too much) the protagonist, Catalina. I thought it was nice to have a smart, cunning, flawed woman. Catalina is able to keep her wits about her, manipulate things to her own end, and is shown to be a competent, powerful leader. However, that doesn't mean that Catalina didn't bug me. Here is a list of the ways that she did: 1. Insta-love with Arthur. Sure, in the beginning, Arthur and Catalina didn't get along. But when Arthur apologizes to her for neglecting her in the cold (where she could have suffered severe injuries from frost bite), Catalina's feelings for him changelike a light switch, and suddenly, they are the most intense lovers of all time. This was just too sudden for me. There was no build-up, no gradual breaking down of walls--something that was sorely needed in this over-long, dull book. 2. Religion. Catalina was a devout Christian; here, she spends more time praying to Arthur and worshiping him beyond the grave. It's rather disturbing that she is still so obsessed with Arthur (after a mere 5 months of marriage!) that YEARS later, she is basically praying to him, asking him for help. I understand people mourn differently, people remember the dead differently, but this was just disturbing. And where was the religious Catalina from history? Also, this quote rather bothered me: \"But if my earthly father can forget me and forget that I was his favorite child as he has done, then I suppose My Heavenly Father can forget me too.\" I know that, at the time, Catalina said this, she was in despair, but I would have thought that a devout Christian would realize that earthly father =/= heavenly father (because the earthly father is DUH human and fallible!). There are ways to do the \"God has forsaken me\" without drawing this odd conclusion. 3. Modern views. Catalina meets up with a Moor (Muslim) at one point, and actually begins to change her mind about the Moors and their treatment. Not saying this wouldn't have happened back in that day, but it feels awkward and unnatural in this context (and unnecessary?). 4. Marriage with Henry. While occasionally Catalina talks about her love for Henry, I never can buy it. She only rarely mentions her feelings to Henry, instead harping on her long-lost Arthur. I do appreciate how Gregory tried to let Catalina move on; I would have liked to see something more pronounced, where Catalina did more things for her love of HENRY instead of her love of ARTHUR. 5. Ambition via MY MAN. Catalina swears to Arthur she will marry Henry and become queen. And that is what motivates her throughout her life (oh, sure, there's this one line about \"her own ambition\", but I don't believe it at all). Why is every ambitious woman BAD (Anne Boleyn) unless she wants to do it for her husband (Catalina)? Why can't a woman have her own ambition and not be good? Not as long as with Mary or Hannah, but just as irritating. I'm tired of writing this, but other characters are one-note. \"Childish\" Harry. \"Lover\" Arthur. \"Crass\" Henry. \"Wise and respectable\" Moor physician. I just get tired of seeing characters written as one thing and never given any chance to change or grow or be anything like a real person. The romance was saccharine; a brief fight, then a nuclear bomb couldn't drive Arthur and Catalina apart. As for whether or not they consummated their relationship, I don't know. I think you could make a case for either side. But I certainly don't buy that they had sex basically every night, and SOMEHOW Catalina didn't get pregnant. I looked up Catalina on Wiki and was shocked by all the awesome things she did in her reign as queen (regent and Spanish ambassador?!). Unfortunately, this book really didn't make me all that interested in researching her or finding out more about her. Most of her early life is skipped; far too much time is on her telling Arthur far more interesting stories of time in Spain (another instance of breaking the \"Show don't tell\" rule) or jumping his bones. The latter half is more interesting, but the repetition and near-constant \"my love, Arthur\" business was enough to make me scream. The novel ends abruptly in an odd place, with many more years of Catalina's life (including the birth of her daughter) to go. And the entire battle was hastily managed. One minute, Catalina is riding out to meet the Scots; the next, a messenger comes back to announce the Scottish King is dead! I literally had to go back and relisten to this section to make sure I hadn't missed anything. As for the narrator, Jill Tanner was brilliant. I think she was more than capable of sounding queenly and regal (though Jill did not give Catalina the foreign accent she did in TOBG) and the other characters were decently voiced as well, distinct enough that I knew who was saying what. I think this may be the end of the Philippa Gregory Tudor Series line for me. I know that TOBG and TQF weren't the best novels in the world, but I actually was somewhat interested in their stories and mildly entertained. \"The Constant Princess\" I found to be a \"constant bore\". I struggled to get through parts and couldn't even muster the will to look up the amazing Queen Katherine on Wiki. Maybe if you like Queen Katherine or Philippa Gregory or are just wanting historical (romance) fiction lite, you will enjoy this. If that doesn't apply to you, I recommend avoiding.

But she does it with enough nuance that I found that not only did I not mind it, but it truly enriched the story. It was a little hard to get into at first, as military history was my downfall in college and it begins describing Catherine of Aragon\u2019s life as the youngest daughter of the Catholic warmongers Ferdinand and Isabella. Tudorphiles often forget that Catherine of Aragon was the infanta. She was quite beautiful when she was young and she was the daughter of Spain\u2019s most glorious monarchs. Needless to say, I found myself drawn into the story. I was extremely emotionally affected by many episodes in the book and by Gregory's interpretation of Catherine\u2019s oh-so-debated virginity after her first husband\u2019s (Arthur) death. In fact, had to put the book down for a week because I couldn't think about anything else and it was really getting to me. It reads like an alternative history and it breaks your heart to think that this woman, who is so often portrayed as the dowdy, helpless first wife of the infamous Henry VIII, could have lived such a painfully sweet existence. The ending is abrupt but necessary for your sanity after the heartbreak that you will feel throughout the book's duration. I recommend this novel for amateur and professional historians everywhere but beware: you must have not let your historical prowess get the best of you. Just enjoy the story for what it is. ...more For me, Gregory's big problem is point of view. Her first-person narratives are fantastic, but her third-person ones suck.

Are they journal entries from the protagonist, Katherine of Aragon? Just musings? Often, the narratives overlap, which could be interesting, but really just comes off as jarring. I don't really get what she's trying to do; obviously, many of her books revolve around Henry VIII, so writing each first-person would not have been too repetitive, and would have added to the strength of her Tudor novels, which is her uncanny ability to see these characters each in a different light. Although she's written about the court of Henry VIII several times now, each new focus manages to be fresh. I don't know why she just didn't write Katherine's story first person. That being said, I did enjoy it. Katherine's a great character, and she picks her up early enough so that we see her grow, drops her off right at the Boleyn moment. It's also the first time we see Henry so young, and that was interesting, especially knowing what we know about whom he would become. The secondary characters aren't that great, however, despite--and this is what gets me--the switches to third-person narration. The best one is Henry's older brother, Arthur, but the love story between him and Katherine is rather sappy and contrived, very Scheherazade. Very. So basically this one's flawed but still plotted, so nowhere near as horrible as The Virgin's Lover. Anyway I'm hooked on Gregory even despite her faults. Not really sure why; she's a good character writer, I think, creates very human ones. I'd love to see her tackle Henry straight on, as protagonist.

So I decided to give The Constant Princess another try. This time, I forced myself to forget that we were talking about those Tudors; I pretended they were made-up characters. It sort of worked, most of the time. It worked enough for me to conclude that once I got past the historicity issues, it was actually a pretty good book. Gregory's a good writer, and does very well at evoking the atmosphere of Tudor England. I eventually got caught up enough in this atmosphere to end up enjoying the book. So I guess I'd recommend it, but it will probably seem better to those of you who don't know or care much about the historical Tudors. Oh, and seriously, I'm tempted to buy Gregory's books just for the cover art. Gorgeous. ...more It is difficult to know where to start with this review.

The premise sets off alarm bells that the story may seem confusing or disjointed with so much switching about, and indeed there are other novels which employ this tactic to disastrous effect. Gregory manages to prevent head-spinning confusion, but instead demonstrates a lack of writing skill. To be told facts about a character's personality and opinions is fine from time to time, but these ought to be demonstrated mainly through the character's actions. This gives the reader a sense of plausibility, since in real life we judge others mainly based on what we observe of them and have no magic method to take a peek into their thoughts. When authors have trouble showing, they fall back on simply telling their readers what they want to convey and expecting the reader to buy into it. It's poor writing. Gregory lacks the skill or imagination to develop a characterisation over time, so she just plops down huge chunks which delve into Catalina's character and emotional reactions by falling back onto character thoughts providing the necessary narration and exposition. It's about as subtle as a charging rhinoceros, and is a bad writer's crutch. Instead of observing for ourselves that Catalina has fallen in love with Arthur, it must be spelt out through an internal monologue. Many of these monologues refer to events and other characters without actually showing us what happened or giving us any real evidence of what we're being told. This would be bad enough, but oftentimes these character's thoughts segments reveal that internally Catalina's thoughts directly contradict the actions she undertakes as described in the preceding third person perspective scene, leaving the reader to feel like they've been hit in the face by a frying pan out of the blue. The book also suffers from frequent examples of redundant repetition. This is where a writer might write several sentences explaining something in a slightly different way each time but which are essentially all conveying the same message. This makes the passage sound long, clumsy, and unnecessary. For example, in one monologue we are told, with very little variation of the wording, that Catalina and her sisters walked in the gardens and ate the fruit and bathed in running waters, all created by the Moorish architects, no less than three times. This thrice repetition, without hardly any rephrasing, just plopped down there on the page, smacks of cut and paste. It's like Philippa Gregory really wanted to get in there somewhere this idea, tried writing three similar approaches and then forgot to delete two of them. Repetition like this should have been cut out in editing. The most grating example of redundant repetition is however Catalina's constant insistence that it is her destiny to be queen of England. I get that she's the \"constant princess\" of the title and that Catalina's faith and determination to secure her match is what keeps her going through the long years of hardship, and that it's the running theme of the book, but it doesn't need to be repeated word for word every ten pages. Gregory's choice of topic piques the interest. Katherine of Aragon is not frequently written about in historical fiction, and the early years of her life even less so - most works featuring her focus on the messy proceedings of her divorce from Henry. However, Gregory misjudges the pacing of events. As a book about the life of Katherine of Aragon, I expected it to cover her entire biography, but instead the book ends only a couple of years into the reign of Henry VIII, thus omitting entirely many of the most significant events of Katherine's life. So, the apparent focus of \"The Constant Princess\" is the theme of Catalina's struggle to achieve her goal of becoming Queen of England and her constancy in never wavering from this task. Logically, the climax of the story should then be the point at which this goal is achieved, perhaps at her wedding to Henry with the end of the book coming after she has managed to successfully pull the wool over his eyes on the wedding night. Inexplicably, Gregory chooses not to make this the story's climax or end the novel at this point, but plods on for several more chapters into the first couple of years of Henry's reign, in which largely nothing happens at all except Katherine schemes to get her husband out of the country so that she can tempt the Scots into invading England and defeat them in a decisive battle. I suppose Gregory thought that the successful wedding and achievement of all Catalina's hopes wasn't exciting enough, and that she thought it would highlight Catalina's links to her battling mother by having her \"heroically\" win a battle. After the massive build up that Gregory gives it, the whole matter is resolved when a messenger arrives to tell Katherine that the army she sent ahead under an English commander has defeated the Scots. This may have happened historically, which is fair enough, but Gregory's failure is in building up Katherine as a warrior queen who will personally don armour and lead the English into battle, as the climax of the novel, and then Katherine never has to go through with it - causing the build up of promised heroics and excitement to fall completely flat. Gregory portrays the relationship between Catalina and Arthur as initially awkward and frosty, but swiftly turns it into a bodice-ripping whirlwind romance worthy of a Harlequin pulp novel, with Arthur sneaking about every night to come and see her. The eponymous character herself was virtually unrecognisable from the actual historical Katherine, and perhaps even worse came across as selfish and unlikable. She ruins the reputation of one of her ladies in order to keep her secret about the consummation, schemes to get Henry out of the way so that she can go to war against the Scots, and denigrates Henry's sisters - Catalina comes across as a self-centred, pretentious prima donna. We are told that she and Arthur imagine a better way to rule, and Catalina's internal thoughts repeatedly tell us that she is supposedly concerned with doing what's best for England - and yet she cruelly orchestrates the downfall of Lady Margaret Beaufort, who is attempting to save the country's finances, for no other reason than Catalina is desperate to keep her grip over the young Henry VIII. Her actions thus contradict what we are being told, causing Catalina to comes across as vain, self-serving, and cruel. Philippa Gregory takes a shot at trying to explain the origins of Henry's later notorious changeable temper and arguably tyrannical actions, by depicting him here as slow witted, fairly self-centred, and a spoilt child. This crude stab fails to even get close to the enigma of the complex personality of Henry, and explain how he transformed from enlightened prince to autocratic tyrant. Overall, whilst the language is at least competent it is nothing exceptional, and Philippa Gregory falls down in her storycraft, using bad author crutches and warping all the historical fact out of the novel. These characters resemble their historical counterparts in name only. Read if you've got a few hours train journey ahead of you and want to fill up the time with indulgent but mediocre fluff, not if you want something of groundbreaking substance to get your teeth into. If you give this one a pass you won't be missing anything. ...more \u0393\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd Philippa Gregory \u03ad\u03c7\u03c9 \u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03be\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03ad\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u03bc\u03c5\u03b8\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, \u03c9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1 \u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03c7\u03b5 \u03c4\u03cd\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03c9 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2. \u0397 \u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03cc\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5 \u03c4\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c1\u03af\u03be\u03c9 \u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ac \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c6\u03b7\u03bc\u03b7 \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03c1\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 8\u03bf\u03c5, \u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u03ad\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0391\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2. \u039c\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03ce \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c9 \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ac\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b5 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd.

No one can be certain if Catherine's first marriage was ever consumated but I liked the angle that the author went with this. I certainly have a new respect for Catherine of Aragon. Just a few things I'd like to note. First I don't understand why the author decided to call her Katherine instead of Catherine. Second, I've read several of her works and there is quite a lot of repetition. This book could have been shorter if we had not been subjected to quite so much of Catherine's internal monologue, many of her thoughts we'd heard earlier in the novel were repeated throughout. If you're a fan of the Tudors you should give this a go. ...more Nakon Bijele kraljice, ovo je druga knjiga koju sam \u010ditala od P.

Historical Fiction is now one of my favourite genres, even though I haven't read much, because of its pacing, character development, and plot. This genre is not for everyone. It can be incredibly slow, assumes the reader has knowledge of actual historical events, and at times not much happens in terms of plot since its roots in actual historical events. If you're the kind of reader that loves to just live in a world with the characters and are a fan of history then Philippa Gregory will be your new addiction. The Constant Princess follows Kathrine of Aragon from her childhood days in war with her parents, Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon, until she is shipped off to England to marry Arthur, the future King of England. This book follows her very tumultuous journey from princess to queen and all the choices and decisions she had to make along the way. What makes The Constant Princess a unique story is Katherine herself. She was an incredible woman, made more incredible by the feats she was able to attain during her time in power. Her determination, will power, and belief in herself allowed her to accomplish almost impossible feats and made reading her story and perspective a joy to read. Overall, The Constant Princess was the perfect book for me to read as my first venture into this new genre. If you enjoy slower paced books, history, and a kickass main character then The Constant Princess is the book for you. ...more Let me start by saying this: If you hated The Other Boleyn Girl for it's lack of exciting events and boring pace, good luck getting past page 100 of The Constant Princess. Now, I'm no fan of Philippa Gregory. To be honest, I HATE the way she writes. She spins in circles, repeating the same crap over and over again. She includes tons of unneeded fillers. Ugh.

Now, I'm no fan of Philippa Gregory. To be honest, I HATE the way she writes. She spins in circles, repeating the same crap over and over again. She includes tons of unneeded fillers. Ugh. I simply read her books because I like the history. After enjoying The Other Boleyn Girl, I went on to the Boleyn Inheritance, finally deciding to go back in time with the Constant Princess. The Constant Princess provided an insider's view into the world of Queen Katherine and Henry. I was surprised to find that Katherine actually had substance.. I had originally thought that she was just some obedient moron who wouldn't move it on out of there for the next girl. But by reading the Constant Princess, I learned that she was simply determined and driven by her faith. She stayed unwanted because she had already spent many years waiting for the throne. She was used to being mistreated, and didn't think it'd be possible that she'd lose her position. And so on with the revelations. As for Henry, that big selfish boy, you learn about his upbringing and why he married Katherine. You understand why he claimed that the marriage wasn't blessed by God. I still consider the King unloyal, selfish, and gross, but now I know what made him tick. The ending was very rushed. I wasn't discontent because I knew how it all ended, but she cut off right after Katherine won the battle against the Scots. She then skipped to a time later in her life when Henry had strayed many times and eventually turned against her in court. She didn't even include the verdict or mention that she had a girl. Nada. It was like Gregory had had enough of the story and wanted to quit writing. SO, Great story, poor execution as with all of Phillipa Gregory's books. Note: If you liked The Other Boleyn Girl and want more history read this. If you didn't like The Other Boleyn Girl, but want to learn more about the History, do a little research on the internet and skip this. I'd read The Constant Princess, then The Other Boleyn Girl, then The Boleyn Inheritance in order. The story is probably more interesting that way. ...more In this book, Philippa Gregory tells us the story of Katherine of Aragon, a Spanish princess who became Queen of England. The story begins with Katherine (still know as Catalina) as a child, growing up in the battlefields while her parents, Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand, drove the Moors out of their country. She had been bethroted to Arthur, the eldest son of Henry Tudor and Elizabeth, almost since her birth. Still a teenager, Katherine travelled to England to marry Arthur and become Princes In this book, Philippa Gregory tells us the story of Katherine of Aragon, a Spanish princess who became Queen of England. The story begins with Katherine (still know as Catalina) as a child, growing up in the battlefields while her parents, Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand, drove the Moors out of their country. She had been bethroted to Arthur, the eldest son of Henry Tudor and Elizabeth, almost since her birth. Still a teenager, Katherine travelled to England to marry Arthur and become Princess of Wales. She is determined to become Queen of England, since she was raised believing that to be her destiny. But her happiness is short-lived, as Arthur dies some months after their marriage, and, without an heir and being a widow, Katherine becomes next to nothing in a foreign country. But her ambition, her beliefs, have not died with Arthur. With persistance and cunning, Katherine manages to marry Henry, Arthur's young brother and heir to the throne. This way, Katherine of Aragon becomes what she had always believed she would become: Queen of England, the ruler of one of the greatest empires the World has known. I liked this book well enough, but didn't find it perfect. Katherine was most annoying with all that talk about how becoming the Queen of England was her destiny, and her conviction that was her mission to rid the world of the followers of the Islamic faith. It was a high point for me when Katherine realizes that her parents (and Katherine herself) have been wrong in what the Moors, their knowledge and culture, were concerned. I thought the story was rather slow-paced, with some things that were hard to believe. Like Katherine's relationship with Arthur: an arranged marriage with mutual love? In the beginning of the sixteenth century? And could Katherine have behaved so intimately with her husband? The fact that the story was told by both an omniscient narrator and from Katherine's perspective was interesting, but I thought it not happily done. There is a lot of repeated ideas in the parts told from her perspective, and some of them are mere ramblings around the same thing; I found myself skimming through these parts quite often. Despite these things, the story was interesting and I liked the descriptions, both of the battles and of the life in Court. ...more Who is this woman, whose fame rests on her inability to produce a male heir for Henry VIII? In this book the author attempts to envision her life. The first part is credible. The author describes how Catalina, the child of Spain's powerful co-monarchs, could have developed a belief in her destiny.

The first part is credible. The author describes how Catalina, the child of Spain's powerful co-monarchs, could have developed a belief in her destiny. From this seed, Ms. Gregory builds the case for a steely purposeful woman who affects all the airs of the monarch she aspires to be and exudes its sense of entitlement. This is the attitude and the outlook she would have to have to endure her later abandonment. I don't know the evidence on which history rests a judgment that Arthur was too sickly to consummate his marriage, but Gregory doesn't buy it... at all. Arthur is shown to be healthy. His fatal illness is sudden. His deathbed charge to his wife, while not realistic for the time, does have some novelistic development in how the young couple plans their future reign. History pays little attention to the emotions of this abandoned 16 year old girl/widow. She is subject to international games over which she has no control and little access to knowledge. Gregory is at her best as she imagines Catalina's thoughts and feelings in the 7 years uncertain wait for Henry VIII. I don't know the historical probability of the attentions of Henry VII to his daughter-in-law but the writing (or maybe this plot line) doesn't ring true. Another difficult plot line is the imagined pregnancy and the call to the doctor who is a Moor. Catalina's attitude to Moors would be highly unusual. After this, the story races to an end. While the whole telling doesn't fully hold together, the book gives a different look at Katherine and posits some interesting ideas as to her character and how she might have interacted with her new English family. ...more I enjoyed this view of a younger, more passionate Katherine of Aragon. While I know better than to assume it is historically accurate, I enjoyed this tale. I especially enjoyed reading about Granada and the Moors. Although, I think the author should have gone forward to the end of Katherine's life. I know her later days have been well covered, but it was a bit of a cop out to leave out so much of her story. Although \u201cThe Constant Princess\u201d has never been recommended to me specifically, the enthusiastic response to \u201cThe Other Boleyn Girl\u201d \u2013 Gregory\u2019s most well-known novel \u2013 was enough to encourage my purchase of it a couple of years ago.

She is touted as a fabulously emotive historical fiction writer, and yet my initial response was to discard it after I had read the first couple of pages. Roll on 18 months, and my recent second attempt at ploughing my way through was barely underway before I remembered what it was that had put me off from finishing the introductory chapter, let alone the novel, the first time around. To be fair to the author, my biggest gripe is less to do with her and more a fault with the editing. It\u2019s a shame that they don\u2019t give the name of the specific editor on the publication page in novels, because he or she would probably never work again. The oversights in this book were so progressively irritating that I was almost on the phone to HarperCollins begging them to fire the fool who created such a shambles out of an already questionable manuscript. The most common issue was the punctuation. It was a disaster. The misuse of commas was almost painful; thrown around with wild abandon where semi-colons or full stops would have worked infinitely better. Now, I admit that I am a grammar Nazi and that the majority of readers would probably not be worked up into such a fluster by a few misplaced dots and squiggles, but the fact is that the ideal novel should read smoothly and cleanly, with no attention paid to the punctuation whatsoever. Just like theatre stagehands and butlers, stops and commas are noticeable only when they\u2019ve made a mistake. Do their job properly and they should fade into the background, embedded neatly into the lines of the story, allowing a flow of semantic traffic like a well-placed literary roundabout. When you start to notice, comment upon, and get angry at the comma situation, you know there\u2019s a problem. And it wasn\u2019t just once or twice, but several times . . . on every page. Whilst I acknowledge that perfect punctuation in the English language is a endless and thankless debate with no clearly defined boundaries or answers, quite frankly an editor should have at least have a fundamental working knowledge of the use of commas. This is a person who works with words for a living; and he or she has even less of an excuse when the language and style is as basic as this. And so to my second point: vocabulary. Apparently the average person has a vocabulary of approximately 30,000 words. Journalists can claim between 50 and 70,000, and Shakespeare\u2019s limit supposedly ran up to six figures (although admittedly he made most of them up himself). Gregory would have trouble bypassing 1,000. The monotony of her descriptions astounded me, especially with such passionate claims on the cover that she is able to \u201cbring the sights, sounds and smells of 16th century England to life\u201d. I wonder whether the critic and I were reading the same book \u2013 or if her publisher cannily chopped off the start of the sentence, which began \u201ccertainly does not\u201d. She frequently uses the same adjective in one sentence, which is beyond lazy, and into the realm of questionable literary sanity. Shift+F7 will conjure up a list of basic Microsoft Word alternatives for the most inactive of authors, and one would hope that a writer as prolific as Gregory might have a real-life thesaurus to hand. Apparently, however, she does not. Repetition and inane lexicon aside, her descriptions are vapid and uninspiring, as is the fictional love story upon which the entire novel is based. Katherine of Aragon no doubt had a fascinating life. From cradle to grave, she was surrounded by figures who would become steeped in history and legend, and she herself performed and was party to deeds and occurrences which had an enormous effect on the political and geographical future of Europe. And yet, despite all this, Gregory STILL manages to paint her as two-dimensional and forgettable. I never really cared about her, or anybody else. Again with the editing, some parts of her life were impossibly drawn out, whilst others were glossed over in a matter of sentences. The whole thing reads like a historical Mills & Boon, and not a particularly fascinating one at that. After finishing the book, and remembering embarrassingly little of my history, I had a quick glance through the Tudor queen\u2019s Wikipedia page, to bring myself up to date on the later years of her life. It concerned me somewhat that the brief, yet detailed, amateur article was far more captivating than the entire novel I had just read \u2013 and gave me more information than Gregory had managed into the bargain. The fictional relationships and descriptions are simply dull, which is beyond frustrating since this was all Gregory had to work at in order to create an interesting novel. She was handed the ideal subject on a plate; a fascinating woman, surrounded by myths and legends, with exotic royal parents and married to arguably the most famous monarch of all time. The story was basically written for her; all she had to do was fill in the gaps, and make up some interesting fluff to pad out the pages and make it into a rip-roaring read. Quite how she managed to fail so spectacularly, and make an interesting story into a boring book, is beyond me. Next time I\u2019ll just stick to Wikipedia! ...more I gave this book 3 stars--so, I liked it.

The Constant Princess is the story of Katherine of Aragon aka Catilina, Infanta of Spain and her betrothal to Henry's older brother, Arthur. She is quite determined to become the Queen of England--even at a very young age she knows it is her destiny, something she has been conditioned for her entire life and will stop at nothing to achieve this goal. She marries Arthur. They quickly (and secretly) ignite a passionate love affair then, a short time later, he falls ill and dies. In order to fulfill a deathbed promise to her beloved husband Arthur, Catalina must convince the court that her marriage to Arthur was never consummated. Therefore making it possible to annul the marriage allowing her to marry Arthur's brother, Henry, as she promised--with the court's permission of-course. Although there is doubt as to whether Catalina is still a virgin, there is no one to dispute her claim. For an agonizing period of time (for her and the reader) she was shunned by the court and stricken by poverty--lying in wait for the approval of the King of England to marry Arthur's younger brother, Henry. There were many dynamics at work--which was pretty drawn out IMO, but Henry was given the choice to marry her or not. He chooses to marry her and proceeds to be the childish, womanizing and selfish bastard he is portrayed as in The Other Boleyn Girl (I saw the movie--please don't judge me :-) He comes across as so darn cute and innocent (which is fine for a puppy, but not for a King) that you really want to like him, but by the end of the book, I just wanted to slap him. I guess that is how I was supposed to feel, so kudos to Gregory for igniting that emotion! Philippa Gregory probably knew The Other Boleyn Girl would follow The Constant Princess, but I thought it would have added a bit of \"umph\" to this book if she had expanded on the affair Henry had with Ann Boleyn. As it was, the affair was barely a blip in comparison to other matters that were not nearly as interesting--which considering the Boleyn girls were eventually the reason for the Queen's downfall, she could have indulged the reader a little. I also thought that it ended a little abruptly (at around 500 pages) especially after how some of the sections seemed to drag--she could have trimmed the fat in the dragging areas. Despite my complaints of the dragging plot, I would recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction. \u2733\u2733 Reviewed on I \u2665 Bookie Nookie Reviews ___________________________________________________ If you like this type of book, you might enjoy one of these groups.

It has been a while since I read historical fiction and this book reminded me why it is one of my favorite genres.

As for the gigantic \"lie\", I am no historian and as stated, am not very informed of Tudor history but I do not find it hard to believe someone in her shoes would bend the truth for either monetary gain (for survival/security, not greed in this case) or to fulfill what you feel to be is your religious duty or destiny.

A very good read. ...more I have not read many Philippa Gregory books, but this is my favorite so far. I love the story of Katherine of Aragon, however embellished it may be. I love the lusciousness of Philippa's imagination bringing a completely believable story to the unknown crevices of Katherine's life and then setting it on the gorgeous backdrop of the Tudor time period. It was excellent. I really enjoyed The Constant Princess, even if I think that Philippa Gregory's books are better when from a first person point-of-view (and not switching from third to first). 4.5 Loved this book and cant wait for the next in the series!

Following Anne Boleyn, Katherine of Aragon (or Catalina, depending if you want the Anglicized version of her name or the original Spanish version) is one of the better known wives of Henry VIII. However, most know her during Anne Boleyn\u2019s time as a mistress rather than queen. Her virginity was investigated, she was made a complete fool by everyone as her first marriage was paraded in front of everyone, simply trying to find out if she was a virgin or not when she marrie Henry. Personally, I believe that she was a virgin; if she had lost her virginity, everyone would have heard about it, and honestly from all the documentation of Katherine\u2019s life, she was a devout woman. She wouldn\u2019t have lied about something like that. However, I really enjoyed Ms Gregory\u2019s interpretation of the history, and I can see where she\u2019s coming from with it. What really happened that night is between two people, one of which died young and couldn\u2019t refute what was said. Besides, both of them are dead now. No one will be able to find out anymore. By any means, this isn\u2019t the raunchiest or raciest book in this series. It\u2019s pretty dull unless you\u2019re interested in Tudor history like I am. (You\u2019re reading a review of someone who literally has Anne Boleyn\u2019s signature tattooed on his arm. I\u2019m a die-hard Tudor nerd and an Anne Boleyn fanatist. I love Tudor history from Bosworth to James I of England.) The pacing, however, was very good. I loved in the beginning with her husband Arthur -- Henry\u2019s older brother in case you\u2019re not familiar with the history -- and how they were two children. All the plotting and planning of young people in love. Plus, how cute was this: \u201cTell me a story.\u201d Every night, Arthur wanted to hear a story. They were enchanted with each other and the world around them, which was shattered when he died. \"God does not make the way smooth for those He loves. He sends hardships to try them. Those that God loves the best are those who suffer the worst.\u201d For Katherine, these hardships came one in many. First, at the age of barely 16, her husband dies, leaving her a widow. Then, her parents refuse to pay her dowry and then her father-in-law, Henry VII of England, refuses to pay her widow jointure, leaving her completely penniless and forced to sell plates that she was supposed to give for her dowry. So, then she technically owes Henry VII money for that. Not to mention, in this version of history, she\u2019s forced to say she\u2019s a virgin. And, that\u2019s something she stays with for her whole life, lying to God (and committing a grievous sin as well in the eyes of the Church) and everyone else. Her faith is in her dead husband, who she will always love and strive for her ambition to rule as he would have wanted her to. After that, Elizabeth of York -- her mother-in-law -- dies. That means Henry VII is on the prowl for a new wife. He wants her, this young thing of 16-17. All of that is historically accurate. I think that\u2019s the creepiest part for me. A man of about 46 wanting to marry a teenager. Ugh. Cradle snatcher. Bad enough that she got married at 15, you know? Even after she throws him off, she\u2019d engaged to Henry, Prince of Wales -- future Henry VIII -- and his forced to wait seven years to marry him. His family hated her, didn\u2019t want her anymore. Even with her dowry paid and Henry reached his age of majority, nothing. It\u2019s not until Henry VII dies that she\u2019s allowed to marry him. Once she\u2019s queen and her ambitions are truly recognized, she cannot escape the hardships God wants to throw her. Death upon death of her children, never giving up hope that she would one day conceive. Having to deal with her childlike husband\u2019s wishes and infidelities that come one after another as well. Katherine of Aragon is the picture of strength and faith. \"In this world, we women often find that we have no power over what men do.\u201d She learns that the hard way. From her father failing her at every turn, to Henry VII\u2019s cruelness in her widowhood, and to Henry VIII and all the terrible things he did to her, she learns that. \"If I had to choose between extreme sorrow and extreme happiness, I would always choose sorrow, for when you are happy you forget about spiritual things, you forget about God. But, in your sorrow, He is always with you.\u201d * Again, following Anne Boleyn, I think I look up most to Katherine of Aragon as his wife. She was incredibly queenly. She was exactly the queen that England needed most. In the face of her husband\u2019s infidelity, she loved him without fail. She didn\u2019t despair after so many miscarriages, stillbirths, and infant deaths. She never broke her conviction no matter what Henry threatened her with. To her last breath, she was Katherine of Aragon, Queen of England. I admire her for that. Ms Gregory captured all of Katherine perfectly, and showed her change throughout the years as the trials and tribulations mounted upon each other. I thought that was brilliantly done, and so tightly woven when it could have been a monstrous book in length.
