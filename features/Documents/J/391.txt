The first 6 books in this series are great. From then on they seem to turn more and more into porn, starting soft and steadily progressing into hardcore, whereas they used to be a really great exploration of what a world where the paranormal mixes with the normal would be like. So, basically, I stopped buying them but will still pick them up from the library, or if I see them at a garage sale for cheap. That said, <+++>Micah</+++>, which is 3 books ago in the series and I hadn't read, well, I'm up to page 100 and Anita still hasn't 'f*cked someone's brains out', as Laurell so quaintly describes Anita's sexual escapades now. Maybe there's hope for Laurell yet? ---- Adding to what I wrote above, while still reading the book, I have to say now that I've finished it that Laurell may have been convinced by her editors, publishers or even feedback from fans to lay off of the unnecessary and gratuitous sex scenes. <+++>Micah</+++> would have been better off as a short story (really not enough material to justify book length on this one), but I was glad to see Laurell showing a hell of a lot more restraint when it comes to sex, than in her prior books in this series. ...<---F>more Micah is a very interesting character</---F>. As I\u2019ve already mentioned he is one of my favorite sweeties. Micah and Nathaniel completely rock my world! Micah was one of my refuges. His arms, his body, his smile. His quiet acceptance of me, violence and all. Now I was back to being scared. Shit. With that said, this book must have been rushed. Either it was rushed or it took awhile to write because it was\u2026boring. I really dislike writing negative reviews, but this is one of my least favorite books in thi Micah is a very interesting character. As I\u2019ve already mentioned he is one of my favorite sweeties.

With that said, this book must have been rushed. Either it was rushed or it took awhile to write because it was\u2026boring. I really dislike writing negative reviews, but this is one of my least favorite books in this series. Total bummer. When you're reading a series and one of the main characters, one of whom you adore, takes the spotlight in a book all his own ... you want a great backstory! You want a fantastic book that gives you a hello there baby feeling about a character who consumes you. That is not what happens with this book. I adore Olaf and Nathaniel. I sincerely hope that if they receive the attention that is well deserved, it is given with brilliance and passion. I just won't take kindly if Nathaniel is explained in 200 pages ;) The \"ardeur\" completely changed the direction of this series. Once, Blake was a strong-minded, arrogant and a complete prude. Through ties to Jean-Claude I\u2019d inherited some abilities. One of those abilities was the ardeur. It was as if sex were food, and if I didn\u2019t eat enough I got sick. This book takes you out-of-town. Blake needs to raise a zombie for the courts and in order to survive the ardeur, she must bring a sweetie with her or ravage some unworthy stranger. Micah accompanies her, and although there are mild disagreements between them, it\u2019s more or less a yawn grasping story. I really should give this review my full attention and try to point out some interesting aspects but unfortunately, there are none. Zombie. Sex. Death. Survival. That about sums it up. The truth may not set you free, but used carefully, it can confuse the hell out of your enemies. I recommend this book to those reading this series. It can actually be skipped over and not mess with the storyline. If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll suffer through the book because skipping is cheating. Not to mention the OCD would just go all wacky .. Mild sexual content, mild violence. I recommend this book to mature adults. Happy Reading! ...more What a piece of crap. I picked it up at the airport, and I should have left it on the plane. In this little short story we get to see once again that Micah is way too good for Anita. He is such a nice guy, but way too easy to steamroll. And, Anita is the definition of a steamroller. A bitchy steamroller. run away, Micah! So, Micah travels out of town with Anita to do a zombie-raising, and they get to spend time alone for the first time. Of course this makes Anita nervous and bitchy. He even changes their motel room for a nice hotel, on his dime, and she acts like he just cut the bitch. F In this little short story we get to see once again that Micah is way too good for Anita.

He even changes their motel room for a nice hotel, on his dime, and she acts like he just cut the bitch. For some reason, him doing this romantic gesture makes her angry. Unreasonably angry. Seriously? Micah, I know a lot of women who would show some appreciation for you and your..um.. gifts. Also, there is a scene where Micah talks about his brother, and Anita says that she didn't even know he had siblings. Really? He's been living with her for months, sleeping together, and they haven't even talked about the things I know about my grocery store deli clerk? (Hey, people are friendly in the South. If you go to the grocery store, you leave with milk, bread, and a few new friends.) So, basically, this was just another book highlighting the selfish bitchiness of our main character. Yes, I'm almost done with the next book. And, yes, I'm out after that one. ...more I promised myself I wouldn't read past Obsidian Butterfly, but then I was given this for free and I have to see if it's as awful as I think it's going to be... signs are pointing to yes. Page 136 edit: The sex, OMG the sex... I don't think I'll ever stop laughing... Jesusfuck, why do I do this to myself? I hate Micah and I hate novellas disguised as novels. This was a waste of time and about the point I started hating Anita. Mind you I still buy her books, but I think part of me just wishes she would get shot a spend about three books in a coma. Anita gets a call early one morning (does this woman ever get calls during normal business hours?) - it's Larry. His pregnant wife, Tammy, is going into premature labor, and he can't fly out to Philadelphia to raise a zombie for a case. Anita agrees to go, and to restrain the pesky ardeur, she brings along Micah. If I had spent money on this audiobook, I'd be asking for a refund right about now. Unabridged, this \"novel\" is a mere 4 hours long. Ellen Degeneres' Seriously...I'm Kidding is the same Anita gets a call early one morning (does this woman ever get calls during normal business hours?) - it's Larry.

Unabridged, this \"novel\" is a mere 4 hours long. Ellen Degeneres' Seriously...I'm Kidding is the same length, and I think I may have liked that one better. Anyway, after the atrocity that was Incubus Dreams , a largely plotless book that spent more time with Anita hopping in an out of guys' pants than any crime, I wasn't sure I'd ever return to this series. But I needed something a bit lighter than I had been reading, and I figured that the teenie-tiny \"Micah\" couldn't be as bad as \"Dreams\". Turns out, I was right! I found this book to be a great improvement over \"Dreams\". Gone are the five hour long arguments over who is going to sleep with Anita when and in what position. Gone are the constant fights with authority figures. Gone are the endless meanderings of Anita about her relationships. Gone are Anita's hatred for women. This book focuses intensely on Anita and Micah and their relationship. And in that regard, this book is a winner. We actually have time to look at the two and feel their chemistry. And as long as you forget the rape-y shower scene in Narcissus in Chains , you might find yourself liking Micah quite a bit more. But just because this book is better than \"Dreams\", doesn't mean it's fabulous and I'm an <---C>Anita Blake</---C> fan. I mean, dirt is better than kitty poo, after all. This book has plenty of flaws along with our favorite LKHisms: 1. I found myself being OK with Micah - right up until this exchange: \"What was the first straw?\" He looked down, and I realized he was embarrassed. \"What?\" I asked. \"I was too big.\" BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! How am I supposed to listen to that with a straight face? How did the NARRATOR read that with a straight face? 2. How big is too big? Long enough that he could touch his own belly button without using his hands. Thick enough that I couldn't get finger and thumb completely around him when he was at his thickest. Wow, how does Micah have sex with anyone with a schlong like that? I'd think he'd send women to the HOSPITAL with a Wang like that! 3. Just in case you thought Anita might actually start acting and talking like a feminist - no worries! She's the same sexist, misogynistic a-hole as ever! When Larry calls needing help, Anita volunteers, no questions-asked, no hard feelings. But last book, when Ronnie called up drunk, despairing over a broken relationship, Anita got upset that Ronnie made her go to a club to save her and \"threaten\" her delicate Wangs. \"I probably overshared. That girlness again.\" -> Yucky girlness! It's not like GUYS ever overshare or that women DON'T. \"It felt weak and very girl-ic and I didn't like it.\" -> Because doing anything remotely associate with being a woman is BAD. And \"girly\" is now too bleh of a word to use, so let's invent a new one! \"How many women had hurt him?\" -> What about all the women he caused to bleed when he jammed his Wang into them? No, we can't possibly have compassion to them! They are just horrible because they are born with Woohoos that aren't big enough for His Bigness. 4. The ardeur (pronounced humorously as \"ar DOOR\") is back! Fortunately, it only appears once. Unfortunately, the sex scene is your typical squickiness we've come to know and love from LKH, filled with endless repetitions of \"F- me!\", \"So wet, so tight\", and \"OMG, is it even going to fit?!\" 5. Fox and later Franklin both take offense at Anita, as cops in this world are wont to do whenever she appears. Because women in the law enforcement fields in the naughties is so uncommon. Fox quickly though comes to the Light Side when Anita tells him that no, she didn't flirt with a guy from Obsidian Butterfly and everything is totes OK. The other guy makes an excellent point, which Anita steamrolls over. Because while others can't twist the laws to their wills, Anita better'd be able to, gorrammit! What is it about her? She blinks those big brown eyes and everyone just looks the other way as she breaks a dozen rules am bends the very law we're sworn to uphold? 6. The last 20 min of a 4 hour audiobook wrap up the book. More time is spent with Micah and Anita talking or having sex than the so-called plot. What is sadly absent are endless pages of clothing descriptions and truly execrable writing. LKH does detail what Micah and Anita wear, but for once, it was rather brief and not that flowery. As for the writing quality, it wasn't half bad - much like the beginning books - with the exception of the items from #4. This is definitely not the worst of the series; yes, it's not great, but at points, it wasn't half bad. And having it so short was a plus - at least we didn't have 80 repetitive sex scenes and police p!ssing contests! However, I would definitely not recommend buying this; spending full price for this extremely short book is a waste of trees and paper. Pick up a copy used (shouldn't be a problem finding one) or at the library. ...more If I had to pinpoint the exact moment my heart broke while reading this book, it would have to be when Micah earnestly explains to Anita how he'd been unsuccessful in prior relationships due to the enormous size of his wang. Some women, Anita recognizes astutely, are just not built for such endowments. Luckily, Anita is there for him, to love him in all the ways his previous girlfriend couldn't, and to help him begin the healing process.

Luckily, Anita is there for him, to love him in all the ways his previous girlfriend couldn't, and to help him begin the healing process. To be fair, I read this book after I had already \"broken up\" with LKH over Incubus Dreams, but it was in the dollar bin at the used book store, and I got all nostalgia-faced about Anita Blake and couldn't resist picking up. I really should have resisted. Between the larger text, the line-spacing, and the wider margins, this book is much shorter than it appears, but honestily that's a blessing because I never would have made it through another hundred pages of this crap. On top of being short on text, the text was light on actual content. There was a lot of awkward exposition from Anita about her unconventional sex life and commitment issues, and a long, boring, and poorly-edited sex scene. I'd never really cared about Micah in the previous books (like, why was he there? didn't Anita already have enough on her plate?) and this one, in which he's the title freaking character did absolutely nothing to change my mind. LKH, this was a momentary error in judgment. It meant nothing, really. I'm sorry, we're still totally broken up. ...more Micah by Laurell K hamilon, was a fake book.

But you really didn't have too much to write\u2026 So you space it out as far as you can\u2026. That's what Hamilton did for this book.

The whole book is as big as one or two chapters in a normal book, and has as much information. We learn how Micah became a wereleopard, and that's it. I did like what was there, it's just there wasn't anything really there. It's like one bite of a snack. You can even skip this book in the series and never realize you did. It's nothing but a short story/chapter. ...more This is really the end of the series for me. This book is just an sexathon between two of the characters. I could have saved my money and suggest you save yours. Firstly, a pertinent point about this book is it\u2019s short \u2013 it\u2019s about 100 pages long by my e-reader and a substantial part of that is a preview of Danse Macabre. This is normally where I insert my complaints about how I don\u2019t like novellas, but I\u2019ll pass on it this once. But I will say if you are going to write a novella, you have little space to actually waste words \u2013 your words have to count. You can\u2019t write an 80 page story and then waffle.

Unfortunately, this book does waffle \u2013 partly with the standard over-descriptive style interspaced with an annoying amount of recapping (though, to be fair, both are far more restrained than is common in the series) and partly with it taking its time to get on with the plot. We then have scenes that take too long, add very little and take up space: a sex scene to be exact. And there was the obligatory Agent who calls in Anita but can\u2019t be professional enough to hide his obvious dislike (all these people who hate Anita, none of them capable of a veneer of civility) which means we have to have a longwinded rendition of Anita vs The Haterz that will only get worse from this point in the series. We also have a lot of revisiting of Anita\u2019s issues. Now I\u2019m not actually against exploring Anita\u2019s need to constantly sabotage her own relationships, being awkward for awkwardness sake and often fleeing into anger whenever she feels any kind of emotion because she\u2019s terrified of anything that may make her slightly vulnerable. These would be interesting things to explore \u2013 but less so things to repeat ad nauseum. Exploration is not the same as repetition especially in a novella where we have limited space to actually develop things. One thing I was eager to see was some development of Micah. By this phase in the books Micah is pretty much a short guy who is a wereleopard and has a really big penis. As one of Anita\u2019s main men \u2013 growing ever more important \u2013 it would be nice for him to be more than the Giant Kitty Cock (there\u2019s a mental image for you). Of course, this being the Anita Blake Series, \u201cdevelopment\u201d means \u201cbig load of angst.\u201d So we get Micah angst\u2026 about being a wereleopard (therefore a monster) and having a huge cock (and how this made dating hard). Y\u2019know it could be an interesting thing to examine that the much vaunted mega-penis of doom actually has a downside, that most women don\u2019t actually want anything to do with a penis the size of their arm and that it\u2019s very easy to be fetishized because of it. Except we had it used as another example of how Anita is better than all women because not only can she take the super ginormocock of doom but she can do it with minimal foreplay while so very very very very tight (as we were told at extreme length) because she is ANITA!

I paid like 5 bucks for something that had less content then a newspaper. The story was the usual \"I'm Anita Blake. I dress like a slut because my seven boyfriends like it. Not because I am one.

That feminazi stuff gets on my last nerve. A little is okay but if she isn't screwing someone she is cussing them out. LKH's books are just like scooby doo with TONS of sex. It's always the ominous person you meet in the beginning of the book. There. I just just saved you all a lot of time and money. The first few are pretty good until Anita turns in into a psycho slut. Then it's all downhill from there. Although if you are into erotica books then you might enjoy these. LKH should probably go ahead and drop the whole story line part because this is obviously the direction she wants to take this series. ...more This is definitely the worst book in the series so far. First of all, what would normally be five chapters or so in any other book has been stretched out (with large margins, extra spacing between words and lines, and a full page for each chapter number) into twelve. Which means that Hamilton's annoying habit of chapter-long disgustingly graphic sex scenes turned into Hamilton's annoying habit of THREE-chapter-long disgustingly graphic sex scenes--only this time with the stupidest, most eye-roll This is definitely the worst book in the series so far.

Seriously. And the plot is terribly simplistic. Anita gets asked by Larry to take one of his zombie-raising jobs at the last minute, and she takes Micah with her, you know, for the sex. They share their scar stories, there's some talk about how BIG Micah is (ahem), sex, sex, sex, more Micah is SO BIG, and then they go to the job which, of course, goes horribly wrong. This happens in the second-to-last chapter. In the last chapter, Anita wakes up in the hospital and is told that ho-hum, everything turned out fine. The end. The entire book seemed like an exercise in finding out how little work Hamilton could put into this and still make money. So BOO! I'd skip this one, folks. Really. ...more From a blog post I wrote in 2006: This addition to Laurell K Hamilton's Anita Blake series was disappointing. I felt like it was mostly a throwaway story.

Hell, it didn't even have a beginning. I thought I'll really like this one, expected to like it more than the others. But I guess people are right, the series is really going downhill. This story was short and pretty boring, I got used to more exciting stories. Anita fills in as a reanimator for a friend, and has to fly to Philadelphia. Because she\u2019s still getting her ardeur under control, she brings Micah along with her. He tries to set up a little romantic getaway for them because they\u2019ve never really had any long length of time together, and Anita wigs out because she can\u2019t figure out what it means, how she\u2019s supposed to feel, and because she\u2019s stupid like that and can\u2019t appreciate a good thing. Yeah. So they get there and Anita clashes with the Fed Anita fills in as a reanimator for a friend, and has to fly to Philadelphia.

Yeah. So they get there and Anita clashes with the Feds, then she clashes with the judge and one of the lawyers who are involved in the case, then she nearly gets killed by the zombie who wants revenge on the man he feels ended his life. And all of this in just 245 pages? Yeah. Well, the good news is that it\u2019s a fast read. The bad news is that there\u2019s very little plot, there\u2019s the predictable sex \u2013 it\u2019s kinky and wild and Hamilton must be running out of things to say or Anita\u2019s become the type who just repeats \u201cdo me do me do me\u201d over and over again (replace with appropriate expletive). And that was just\u2026annoying after awhile. It\u2019s kind of tiring to watch her go through the same things over and over again \u2013 just attaining new scars, but not really becoming more comfortable with the men/vampires/werethings she\u2019s involved with romantically. It\u2019s not as though I\u2019d want to see her settle down\u2026I just like a little more, oh, I dunno, plot, action to go along with my steamy scenes. She doesn\u2019t seem to be growing much emotionally. She\u2019s still a tough cookie and I\u2019d like to see her DO some things and not just have these one scene wonders where everything blows up in her face and she barely escapes with her life. And then that surrounded by 400 pages of her getting it on with her peeps and worrying incessantly about how that\u2019s going. Bah. ...more Anita is off to Philadelphia to raise a zombie for a court case but with the ardeur being an issue, Micah insists on going with her for the trip. So for the first time, Anita is alone with Micah and that causes problems for her. I swear I was ready to slap Anita into next week with her childish, moronic behaviour in this 'book'.

The guy does something nice for you because it is your first time away together on your own and you go into a sulk! She then starts frowning over the room service meal that arrives. After the meal she then starts thinking about how quickly she had sex with Micah after meeting him for the first time and how he has never asked her about all her scars and she goes into ANOTHER mood. Talk about being a whiny bitch! Then as usual, we have the sexist cops that Anita gets to have a fight with to prove herself-very original. And as she does in every book in the series, she starts brooding over everything. I'm sick to death of hearing her endless woes and I'm not a big fan of Micah either. He's so bland and boring. This book is just a filler and adds nothing to the series. We don't even have the better characters in the series to save the book. It is just dross and you can easily just miss it out. The only good point in the book was the fact that Anita decides to go to work and do some zombie raising but that wasn't enough to save the book. ...more Micah is now, and hopefully will always be, my favourite character in the Anita Blake series. He used to bother me because he was always so accepting that Anita had all of these other guys she was dating or screwing, and finally his anger and unease comes out in this very well written novella. It was also refreshing to read one of Hamilton's books that was on the shorter side. It was a nice break from all of the drama and numerous sex scenes that permeate her other books.

I also really liked this book because it focused on one, and only one, of the men in Anita's life. I can't think of a book so far that has just dealt with one of her lovers. It was especially great because you got to look at Micah more closely. Lately it has just been Jean-Claude and Nathaniel that have been taking up the spotlight and Micah sort of took a background boyfriend role ever since his debut in Narcissus in Chains. I'm usually not one for shipping canon relationships, for example, Ron and Hermione from Harry Potter (I'm more of a Draco/Hermione fan), but Micah and Anita are my favourite couple of the entire series and it makes me a little jealous of these make believe characters and the relationship they have. I would definitely recommend this novella to fans of the Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series, or <---A>Laurell K. Hamilton</---A> in general. I know I have warned this before, but please do not read this series out of order. You will find yourself confused and disoriented with all that is going on. Plus you spoil the reading for yourself. Don't do that. ...more I was never really interested in Micah character nor thought that the addition of said character was necessary. Of all of Anita's men, Micah is how should I say this - flat? Not likable? Unnecessary? Whatever that word might be, the meaning is still the same. Why did Hamilton wrote this book? I don't know really but it didn't do any justice to the series. It's just sad how the avid readers of the series seems to be slipping away because of how the story progress from being awesome to this.

It's just sad how the avid readers of the series seems to be slipping away because of how the story progress from being awesome to this. No word can really describe it. What the reason why I still read the series? I'll give you three. One, I'm an avid fan and will always be. Two, I never abandon a series however the story went. I still enjoy reading the series with all the action but still hoping that the sex part would be lessen. And lastly, I am still praying that Hamilton will turn this series around. I am loyal and I do think that the downhill spiral will change, I just don't know with what book. To sum it up, do I still recommend the series? Hell yes. Do I love it as much as I love the first half of the series, no. Will I still continue reading it? Yes. Should you read it? Well that depends. As I always say, every reader has their own opinion and flavor in book selection but fair warning to those who doesn't like sex scenes to much, this book is not for you. :) Laurell K. Hamilton ...more This was the book that convinced me to not read the Anita Blake series any further. It started going downhill after Obsidian Butterfly, but this got patently ridiculous. At least the Merry Gentry series has always been all about the smut with bits of plot instead of pretending to be a detective series. I think that this was originally meant to be a short story and ran too long for it so she turned it to a short book if you will. The book before this one was ridiculous with all the emergency sex. Don't get me wrong I enjoy a good sex scene a lot but in the previous book, Incubus Dreams, it was OUT OF CONTROL!! I think in ONE night, Anita had sex like FIVE TIMES!!!! All but one of those 5 scenes had another character either taking part in some way, or watching while laying in bed with Anita and I think that this was originally meant to be a short story and ran too long for it so she turned it to a short book if you will.

All but one of those 5 scenes had another character either taking part in some way, or watching while laying in bed with Anita and \"fill in blank\" In this book there was only one sex scene and it was not a group activity so that was much better. I like Micah. I read a few reviews and a lot of the opinions lie with not liking him. While he isn't my type physically he has an awesome personality and I think is the perfect match to Anita. This book did not hold much action, or suspense, and I do agree with one persons description of it being more a fluff piece, but nevertheless, I enjoyed it and liked getting a little bit of insight into Micah. Very short read by the way. I am a slow reader and I read it in about 4 hours total. ...more (sigh) Laurell, what's happened to you? Is putting out a book a year draining you too much? There's no excuse for this. Micah is a novella dressed up to look like a full novel. The plotline is barely there, the characterizations are shallow, and everything just seems wooden & unlikable. The book is actually just as cheaply done as anything else, as the spacing is overdone in order to stretch out a 100-ish page novel out into 300-ish pages.

That's unforgivable. I can only hope that eventually things will improve. As it is, this book contributed to why I no longer purchase her books anymore and why I no longer have read anything after this book. ...more OMG this was a terrible book.

For that I'm thankful I didn't have to shell out money for it. I was expecting more about Micah and his backstory, instead I got backstory on how big his dick was. Sorry not interested. One thing that allowed me to give it two stars instead of one, is that, for a surprising change, there is a bit of a plot to this novel and it wasn't filled with pornographic beastiality sex scenes.

Micah is the thirteenth in LKH\u2019s Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series of lots and lots of sex, racy dialog, with one of her lovers, Micah. Damn if I didn\u2019t want to jump into this book to play the role of Micah. I wanted so much to be Micah in the nice hotel room trip down memory lane when Anita pulled him to her chest. OOO-RAH!!

Anita seems to like well-endowed men and couldn\u2019t walk even if the fire alarm sounded. This is all about Anita\u2019s relationship with Micah, who goes with her to Philadelphia to perform a zombie animation including some weird twists. The assignment is not exactly what she was told as she was substituting for Larry Kirkland whose wife is in premature labor. Through this novella, Anita continues to struggle with her arduer effects which cause her to have sex ever few hours. As normal, Anita is able mostly to resolve each of these difficulties by the end. And of course, Anita is injured and knocked unconscious at the animation but her zombie came to the rescue along with Micah. This adult extra erotica Anita book was full of sex and intrigue and most enjoyable. I\u2019m off to get the next in the series and hope it is as HOT. ...more This book is like a palate cleansing amuse bouche, a way to reset from the others.

My only complaint is that it was so short, literally took me a day to read which isn't unheard of but I mean, I guess I'm just being fussy cause I paid 8 bucks for it and assumed it would be as meaty as the last 2 books. I read these on Kindle so I can't tell from the look of the book how long it is, I usually determine it by how long it takes me to read or what it says on the buying page. It's totally my bad, but I'm waiting a few days to purchase the next book. ...more Shorter than the rest of the series, it's hard to judge this one on the same scale. Not much happened, but then there wasn't time for much to happen. We learned a bit about Micah and saw an interesting zombie case, but there weren't any real developments above and beyond the blood test results, which were reiterated in the beginning of \"Danse Macabre\". Character wise, the only ones we really saw besides Micah and Anita were Larry (via phone) and Nathaniel at the beginning and end.

The scene with Nathaniel at the end was my favorite part of the book.

Then there was the comment about the roses. Still want Richard's reaction to that one. *g* (Reviewed 04/08/2009.) ...more While my interest in the series is fading quickly, I really loved this book.
