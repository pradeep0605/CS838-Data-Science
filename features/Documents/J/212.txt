What I liked The world-building that we see on the planet of Per Ardua is outstanding, it all feels very real and utterly alien particularly the alien life forms that we encounter here. The life cycles of the \"Builders\" and the other alien lifeforms are very well thought out. The planet itself is a pretty unique way of looking at a world which always keeps the same face to it's sun, and you really get to experience this world as our reluctant pioneers have to trudge through it. We also get to see some of the more \"alien\" worlds in our own solar system such as Mercury,<---M> the Moon and Ceres</---M>, which are all compelling. The characterisations were also really good - Yuri Eden is a likeable pioneer even if he is a reluctant one, having been sent to this strange alien world as a convict. Stephanie is also a well-drawn character, as her secondary story about strange time-and-space twisting kernals and a mysterious hatch buried under the surface of Mercury intersects with Yuri's story. What I didn't like The sheer stupidity of the politics here - I'm not a fan of near future political Science Fiction at the best of times, and the horrendous consequences of the developing war between the United Nations and China was hard to read at times. I just wanted to sit them all in a room and make them watch \"Dr Strangelove\" on autoloop until they learned how to behave like adults. There is a sub-plot with a sentient A.I. that is sent to <+++>Proxima</+++> Centauri first before the colonists, but the story never really goes anywhere. Who is Yuri Eden supposed to be, if that isn't his real name? He isn't Dexter Cole (<---B>the first pioneer</---B>), because we find his body later. Does this tie in to any of the author's other novels (which I haven't read). It's frustrating because I know I'm missing something, but I don't know what. Similarly, who are the mysterious aliens that create the hatches and that we only get a glimpse of at the end of the book? Are they from another story? Speaking of the ending, why does Yuri and Steff go through another hatch and find themselves (view spoiler) [in a Christianized modern Roman Empire. (hide spoiler) ] .Is this yet another reference to a different story? So, 4 stars for the world-building, 3 stars for the characters, and 2 stars for the politics. ...more You know, I just can't seem to find hard scifi that really speaks to me.

I honestly didn't plan on reviewing it because I just don't feel strongly enough about it to want to write about it, and it was so incredibly memorable that a few weeks after I read it, I'm struggling to remember the plot. The book itself is long, and the plot is widereaching without ever feeling personal. The book can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a new-world pioneer survival story or a superpower political struggle, so it tries to do both. There's a lot of brain-dead politicking that made me want to smash the whole cast's heads together. Probably the greatest weakness was the characters. Absolutely none of them grabbed me, not the everyman (and blank-slate personality-less) protagonist who goes by the name of Yuri Eden (get it?), not the female scientist whose potentially interesting plotline gets derailed by pure and go-nowhere weirdness, and not the billionaire scientists or the random colonists or the AI whose potentially interesting storyline lies apparently forgotten for most of the book. My absolute favourite character was the pollyanna AI unit that the colonists used. I thought its perspective, particularly on its fellow robots, was perhaps the most interesting part of the book. But while the colonization section provided plenty of fun moments with the Col-U, the whole subplot involved what I consider to be an unhealthy obsession with rape. Rape happens multiple times in the book, both on the ship and off of it. Pretty much all of the male colonists--except for our everyman protagonist-- see the female colonists as their potential property, there to be used as breeding machines. They're not alone; that's what the expedition planned for them as well. Even our good guys are desperate for children. I don't really get the whole \"biological imperative\" that these sorts of stories run on. Baxter does create female characters; I give him that. They're all weak ciphers, but then, so are the male characters. But I don't understand the rape or the biological baby-breeding imperative bit. It did not make for an enjoyable read. Nor did the politics, and nor did the ending. I know I just reeled off a huge number of negatives, and I think that's because I'm struggling to remember the plot and it's the negative bits that stuck most firmly in my mind. The book isn't a bad book, and the premise, and the science it's based on, is interesting enough. I really enjoyed the worldbuilding of Mars and Mercury, and I actually thought the ending to the political subplot was both ironic and fitting. And so my search for personally palatable hard scifi continues. Oh, well. In the meantime, I guess there's always fantasy. ...more This novel has a lot going for itself and while it does not fully succeed in its ambitious goal of integrating three classic but usually disparate sfnal storylines, so being overall less the sum of its parts, the parts themselves attain true magnificence on occasion adn the book is worth reading for sure; not to speak of the sequel (Ultima) that the sort-of cliffhanger ending requires As others noted the blurb is quite inaccurate (even the name of the main human character is wrong as he is known This novel has a lot going for itself and while it does not fully succeed in its ambitious goal of integrating three classic but usually disparate sfnal storylines, so being overall less the sum of its parts, the parts themselves attain true magnificence on occasion adn the book is worth reading for sure; not to speak of the sequel (Ultima) that the sort-of cliffhanger ending requires As others noted the blurb is quite inaccurate (even the name of the main human character is wrong as he is known as Yuri Eden, while his real name is implied in the end pages), so as a quick summary, I would say that Proxima combines bare-bones (little tech, short, nasty, brutish lives) colonization of a strange planet - this part is the best but ultimately is a little irrelevant in the big picture - with humanity encountering mysterious and ultra-powerful artifacts that may give it the stars but at a cost and with grave danger - this part will be most likely the most relevant in the next book - and finally power struggles, politics, conspiracies and standard near-future stuff - this part kind of resolves itself at the end Overall, ambition and some awesome stuff in various parts of the novel overcome the major shortcoming of the whole being less than the sum of its parts and the feeling of forced stitching of sf tropes that do not really work together and as mentioned, that in a way solves itself logically by pushing one trope to front and leaving the rest as \"done\" ...more It's ok.

When I entered Proxima in Goodreads and checked the list of books by SB, I remembered before joining GR, I had read both Flood and Ark . I also remembered that I had been at times irritated by the plot and characters of those two novels. I made it through the first 100 pages of Proxima before I abandoned the book. I consider what I have read of Proxima often ridiculous, quite illogical, violent, misogynistic and generally lacking in respect for people and humankind. Simply put it is illogical to settle a planet with antisocial, criminal misfits and oddballs selected through an unexplained sweep of the Earth and the Moon. A starship filled with violence perpetrated by so called Peacekeepers to keep the potential settlers in place until they are dumped on the new planet makes little sense. In addition, the acceptance of rape and abuse on the starship can only be considered deplorable. Unless you are completely brain dead it makes little sense for a group to riot and trash the starship just as they arrive at their destination. Finally Stephen Baxter portrays most settlers as ignorant, foolish, and with little interest in taking action to survive or to understand the planet on which they will live. There were two other side stories starting to progress as I read, but was so offended by the main story, that I finally gave up. I will likely never pick up another book by Stephen Baxter. ...more Where to begin? I started reading Baxters works about two years ago, and have since come to terms with that he is somewhat uneven in his writing. Some stories are among the best sci fi I've read, some stories are significantly less sharp. Unfortunately the recently published Proxima will have to be filed among the latter.

It's a strange book in many ways. To me it apparently consists of several different storylines that - even if Baxter actually tie them together - don't really belong in the same book. It's an odd feeling being forced to jump between the main story about the colonization of a planet in the Proxima Centauri system and a totally different subplot taking place among the power politics of the solarsystem. There is also a problem with how the story is built. Baxter can spend a couple of hundred pages on a settlements slow moving habits over a barren planet, while an expedition over the other frozen half, a discovery of a strange orbital object and the discovery of a new artifact can become squeezed together more or less within a couple of sentences. On the whole it feels like Baxter have got the balance of the story totally wrong. There is also a promlem with the characters. Even though most of them have their own colourful portriats, in the end all of them more or less boil down to the same characteristics. More specifically - everyone sneers at everyone, all the time. Conversation throughout the whole of the book is characterized by bad manners. The only truly interesting mind in the book is the semi-intelligent robot vehicle that accompanies the colonists on Per Ardua (Proxima). Which brings me to te final questionmark in my review. Reading about the colonists I get the feeling that they really must be genuine airheads. If this is intentional by Baxter or if he has not thought the thing through I can't say but - stranded at their new planet it takes the main characters 20 years or so to accomplish basic colonization stuff like building a hut, searching the nearby forest, make a nice lavatory - things that a normal intelligent human would get done in the first few hours or a in few days maximum. Searching for minerals or workable stone, making ropes, baking bricks, making concrete or pots even or finding something to write on - all such things seem totally alien to the ones landing on Per Ardua. Personally I don't think you have to have a major in Robinson Crusoe to have a small semifunctional society going after a year or so. On the whole the low interest shown by the colonists for their situation is just not plausible. In the end - Proxima - is well written but not a thoroughly thought through story. I've read a lot of these lately, Brins Existence being one of them. I can only conclude ones more: If you don't have a story - don't write it. ...more I have big problems with all the major characters, but this novel deserves 5 stars because of the world-building, the science, the fascinating Solar System, the strangeness of a fully developed alien world, the question regarding our own evolution and the ever curios robot.

For Proxima is not your typical \u2018outwards to the stars\u2019 novel, in fact, often the opposite. From the book: The 27th century: Proxima Centauri, an undistinguished red dwarf star, is the nearest star to our sun \u2013 and (in this fiction), the nearest to host a world, Proxima IV, habitable by humans. But Proxima IV is unlike Earth in many ways. Huddling close to the warmth, orbiting in weeks, it keeps one face to its parent star at all times. The \u2018substellar point\u2019, with the star forever overhead, is a blasted desert, and the \u2018antistellar point\u2019 on the far side is under an ice cap in perpetual darkness. How would it be to live on such a world? Yuri Jones, with 1,000 others, is about to find out\u2026 For a book which has basic SF tropes at its core, it is surprisingly contemporary in tone, taking old SF ideas (colonisation, space travel, strange alien species) and imbuing them with a modern twist. We begin with something tightly focused on one character, Yuri Eden, but then builds up a range of characters to the point where we have an ensemble that we know of and care about. Whilst I understood the book was about space exploration, the first part of the book was not what I expected, to the point that I considered not going further. This is no confident step into the unknown. Yuri is a convict, shipped Botany Bay style to Proxima c (Proxima IV). Earth is a mess, through climate change, and instead of this being a glorious expansion of humans to the stars, there is no further planned funding for projects such as this, and the colonists are more something to be got rid of, as an inconvenience, rather than picked for any great skill. In fact the early days of exploration are generally looked down upon as \u2018the Age of Heroic Expansion\u2019. In short, nobody wants to be there, nor be a settler, stranded without contact to other people. (Compare this with Heinlein\u2019s Farmer in the Sky to see how different Proxima is.) Yuri\u2019s journey is one of being awakened and then survival, interspersed with repeated beatings, fights and conflict from other \u2018colonists\u2019 as well as the ironically named \u2018Peacekeepers\u2019. When the colonists get to Proxima c, an exoplanet, they are stranded with apparently no hope of return to Earth or any means of contacting the other small groups spread around the globe. Yuri and his group of a dozen or so spend much of their first few months ignoring each other, sleeping with each other or killing each other. Much of the first hundred pages or so show this unpleasant and harsh tale, with characters \u2013 misfits, rapists, murderers \u2013 who are also unlikable. It\u2019s grim, in space. This is not the stuff of old SF. But bear with it. What Stephen has done in all of this bleakness is drop subtle little hints that \u2018other things\u2019 are happening. And it is at this point, about halfway through the novel, things turn all \u20182001\u2019 and we suddenly get an idea that, rather than being an unpleasant tale of human decline and squalor, on the cosmic scale Proxima is about things on a much longer timescale and a much bigger canvas. Proxima c itself is an interesting enough idea, being just so big. (And it\u2019s not the only novel to cover such big ideas recently. I\u2019ve also read Stephen Hunt\u2019s In Dark Service, which was a similar environment.) Much of the middle part of the book is spent examining the sheer alien-ness of this new planet. Different climatic zones are created on a world where one zone is bigger than most planets, and where seasons become quite different. What we also get into here is an alien ecology, as the plants on Proxima are similar and yet different to those of Earth. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any animal life here, but instead Stephen spends quite a while explaining the rituals and existence of a bizarre alien ecology named stromatolites, based on a variation of cell-like tubes rather than plant cells and a range of species to rival Earth\u2019s rainforests. As is typical of our unusual colonists, most of the survivors are initially uninterested in these lifeforms or the scientific findings put forward by their group\u2019s ColU (named after the University which created it), an AI robot whose endearing qualities are a constant source of delight through the novel. This does change in the later part of the novel when the situation alters, both on Proxima c and on Earth. A major discovery means that events do become much more interesting, balancing these strange ecologies with both life on Earth and the human expansion across Proxima. At this point the years jump forward quite quickly and it becomes apparent to the reader that we are in for a long haul here. When we reach the final stages of the book and the consequences of human actions are revealed, the book became un-putdownable. It shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, after such a bleak beginning, that the story does not end entirely well, though there are many themes that will no doubt be taken further in the next book, Ultima. In the end, part of the cosmic mystery is revealed, though there\u2019s enough left unexplained and a cliff-hanger that will leave you wanting to read the next book as soon as you can. Proxima is a book of surprises. Whilst its beginning is rather shocking, and not always enjoyable, it builds to something in the end that shows a writer of skill, whose sense-of-wunda shines though. I\u2019m pleased I finally picked this one up. ...more Hard SF novel of first contact and intrasolar war.

Alien artifacts mined in Mercury power large hulk ships for transport across solar distances. A colony is established in Proxima Centauri four light-years from Sol (this takes up the rather slow first part of the book). But soon enough things pick up as the main characters discover that an alien power has left behind a pathway between the worlds. It so happened that I watched the movie version of Carl Sagan 's Contact during the course of reading this book. That movie bears striking resemblance to certain plot elements of Proxima. Sagan opted for a faster transport system and an alien in the form of a human, but the message is the same. The discovery of a benevolent galaxy of aliens saves man from his self-destructive nature. Overall, a good read. I sleepwalked through the first third but this had my full attention the rest of the way. There is a sequel which I will try to get to soon. I may have read some of Baxter's work in the past but this is the first which has struck a chord and made me think about his other works. Recommended for fans of hard or classical SF. ...more Baxter does what Baxter does best: phenomenal world-building using paper-thin characters and pacy interleaved stories, each ending with a cliffhanger so you CANNOT STOP READING.

Yuri, as an accidental relic of earlier times, makes a great protagonist because he knows almost nothing, so the reader gets to explore these extremely interesting times looking over his shoulder. I also like how many Australians there are in this novel. I think the only reason I can't give it five stars is because Baxter already wrote Flood , and that set such a high bar for me, it's pretty tricky to surpass it. This does come close, though. I went straight to Amazon and bought the sequel. ...more Goddammit, Stephen Baxter, I'm trying!

So I guess this is a thing for him. Proxima starts its life as a straightforward tale of enforced penal colonization of another planet before gradually sprawling into a parallel tale of solar system politics before eventually becoming something about exploring weird phenomena. Basically, it\u2019s typical Baxter. I would have loved this more when I was younger. The story gets much better after all the potential settlers, save two, die at the settlement site of interest. The survivors are left with the knowledge that they are no longer trying to establish a self-sustaining colony but are basically just eking out an existence day to day for the rest of their lives. Baxter leaves us thinking that this is the most cockamamie planetary colonization scheme ever dreamed up, until the very end\u2014although the UN is majorly saved by the discovery of The Hatch, because otherwise I still think their colonization plan was a terrible one. Meanwhile, in the solar system, China has taken over Australia and Mars and the asteroids, but the UN-affiliated countries (read: America) have Mercury and its mysterious kernels that can power interplanetary/interstellar ships. Oh, and there are strong AIs hunkering in subterranean facilities, relics from the Heroic Generation when men were real men, women were real women, and strong AIs created from brain scans and deep learning networks were real strong AIs created from brain scans and deep learning networks. No one trusts these AIs, but hey, they make for great deus ex machinae, hmm?

In one of the more blatant set ups I\u2019ve seen in a while, nothing gets resolved before the end of the book\u2014either this book was originally twice as long and had to get split in two, or else this is a cynical attempt to make people buy Book 2, because literally there is no ending. It\u2019s cliffhanger, epilogue, done. Who are those guys, the lost Ninth Legion? I don\u2019t know. Buy the next book to find out! I know my sarcasm above makes it sound like I hated this book, and that\u2019s not the case at all. In fact, for the majority of Proxima , I was enamoured to the point of really wanting to keep reading. That\u2019s probably some of the highest praise a book can receive, right? It is a fun story. It\u2019s just that its substance is stretched so thinly across these 400-some pages. By far the best thing about Proxima is the way Baxter describes life on Proxima c, or Per Ardua. This is a beautiful look at what it might be like to colonize an exoplanet\u2014not just another planet in our solar system, like Mars, but a planet around an entirely different star, one with life like but unlike the life on Earth. Baxter covers the challenges\u2014having to manufacture soil in which to grow crops, adjusting to the different day/year lengths and the increased radiation, the need to carefully select one\u2019s settler groups to avoid what happens here. In his slightly more fanciful but no less impressive depiction of alien, possibly sentient life in the builders, Baxter reminds us how difficult it would be to communicate with a species not of our planet. Basically, Proxima is a potent reminder of the practical challenges awaiting us if we ever attempt to colonize an exoplanet. For all of the above, however, there were paragraphs of expository description and dialogue. There were extraneous characters and paper-thin politics. And all the characters, major or minor or extraneous, fit into a small number of moulds, from the cartoonishly macho and aggressive people like Gustave Klein to the suave but untrustworthy Michael Kings and Earthshines of the world. There is neither depth nor breadth to these people. I can\u2019t help but keep comparing Proxima to Red Mars , the other colonization SF novel I recently read. They share many strengths and flaws. Both are very technical, almost pragmatic looks at the difficulties of settling other worlds. Both have somewhat pessimistic ideas about how much humanity can cooperate in these endeavours (but Baxter\u2019s political scenes are a little harder to believe than Kim Stanley Robinson\u2019s). Is it weird that I found Proxima more engaging, but Red Mars overall the better book? Perhaps that\u2019s just my lingering, Singularity-related obsession with weird alien artifacts manipulating space and time. I\u2019m not going out of my way to recommend this book. If you like this sort of thing, you will probably like Proxima , and there are way worse books you could spend your time on. I can\u2019t even say it\u2019s more ho-hum, nothing-to-see-here, because it definitely has one of the best depictions of exoplanetary settlement we\u2019ll get for a while. Baxter loves to do the research and show off everything he has learned about exoplanets; I can\u2019t fault that love. I just wish it had led, overall, to a more involved story with more interesting people. ...more This was supposed to be an epic book, spanning vast distances and about a century.

It made (some) sense in 1789, and NO sense in this book. The colony starship has suspended animation and waking up facilities. They could train and lecture the colonists on Earth, where food, water, air, space and caretakers/guards are plentiful, and keep them asleep on the journey, waking them up in small groups for final briefings and planetfall. Instead the colonists were woken up at the start of the journey (on the ship no less!), fed, watched over and kept confined and demotivated for more than three years! This an insane waste of space, weight and labor on an expensive ship by very highly trained and presumably high payed people. The excuse that everyone wants to be an explorer but no one wants to be a colonist is simply not true. At the very least fame and monetary compensation for the remaining family can motivate a ton of people to do incredible things, even without mentioning the exotic charm, nature and simple living which are popular even today (I'm not a fan, I know a lot of people who are). It was a nice touch to mention people were carefully selected for genetic diversity. It was stupid to the extreme to not do any psychological profiling and compatibility research. It is stupid to the extreme to not select people with appropriate skills (or at least potential) and motivation. Genetic diversity can be guaranteed with a few kilograms of zygotes. Lack of skills, motivation, preparation and leaderships killed far more colonists during history than lack of genetic diversity. Some lectures were mentioned during the flight, but no effect from them - no enforced discipline, no motivation to do well in them. The colony ship feels like a prison. The colonists themselves behave stupidly - I get it they feel like prisoners, but enough of them have been on ships or habitats before and should know that you don't just go breaking every machinery you can touch on the spaceship you depend to keep you alive, mutiny or not. No team building is ever attempted. It is a nice idea to split the people in groups separated by great distance when colonizing, so a single natural disaster or demented individual cannot take them all. It is stupid not to merge groups when the numbers fall because of pre-settling casualties. Placing guards to restore some numbers is not a solution. The last several years were spent separating them, and now there is no trust between them. From there on the story goes more or less predictably. Suspicion, demotivation and desperation doom the colonists to an at best an early bronze age existence. The part of the book back at Earth is not more engaging, or plot-hole-free. The Anglo-Saxons rule the inner planets and find artifacts that let them have practically unlimited delta V ships (in space this is insanely powerful). The Chinese rule the outer planets and when they get a few of those magic ships they sacrifice all of them to hit the artifacts' source... even when one or two of them would suffice. The book has some nice ideas, but they barely shine through. I'm not reading the next ones. ...more I'd first been introduced to Stephen Baxter via his aeon-spanning widescreen-IMAX Manifold trilogy, and Proxima is a sort of return to that kind of big-canvas science fiction. Spanning decades, rather than millennia, there is nonetheless time for characters introduced early on in the story as children to become major players in themselves, and for the movers and shakers of one generation to grow old and die, or else fade away into the background. It tells three \u2013 or perhaps four \u2013 stories, in par I'd first been introduced to Stephen Baxter via his aeon-spanning widescreen-IMAX Manifold trilogy, and Proxima is a sort of return to that kind of big-canvas science fiction. Spanning decades, rather than millennia, there is nonetheless time for characters introduced early on in the story as children to become major players in themselves, and for the movers and shakers of one generation to grow old and die, or else fade away into the background. It tells three \u2013 or perhaps four \u2013 stories, in parallel. A conscious artificial intelligence which is sent off to explore our nearest celestial neighbour, Proxima Centauri; a manned mission made up of drafted ex-convicts which is subsequently set off to colonise an exo-planet discovered near that star which appears to be suitable for human habitation; and a physicist who discovers a portal on Mercury which enables people to travel at the speed of light between the two planets and, in so doing, also finds she has an identical twin sister of whom she has no memory (this is perhaps the point at which the book ceases to be 'hard' science fiction and nods in the direction of 'fantasy in space'). It's a bit messy, and it didn't have the mind-blowing 'space is big and time is long' impact that the first two Manifold trilogy books did on me (the less said of the third, the better) but there is some interesting stuff in here. Baxter has clearly put a lot of thought into how life on a planet which is orbiting a red dwarf star with no rotation \u2013 one side in permanent daylight and one always dark \u2013 might differ from life on earth. And his alien life forms seem genuinely, authentically alien. The weakness of the book is that, as with so many of Baxter's other stories, many of the characters feel like little more than ciphers to whom things happen. At best, you get a rough indication of someone's temperament \u2013 whether they are inclined to violence, if they are the sort of person to go against the grain, but there is rarely any more exploration of any of the main characters' motivations or back-stories. Even the central focus of the story, Yuri Eden (a pseudonym) seems curiously vacant. On the other hand, if you've only got 400 pages, and you want to explore interstellar travel, space warfare, esoteric physics, the brutal reality of setting up a tiny colony on an alien planet with press-ganged colonists and only the dimmest idea of what you will actually be facing, perhaps it's a little unfair to expect the author to really spend time fleshing out his characters too. And it would be a little churlish to complain about the AI-robot accompanying the colonists which acts throughout the book a a kind of 'exposition device' when there is simply so much exposition to do. Frustratingly, it's the first of a series of books, and it doesn't really even attempt to wrap up the many plot threads it sets running (worse, I've read on here that the second book in the series is not nearly as good). But if you can live with that, there's an interesting exploration of the colonisation of alien worlds in here. ...more I would have given this more but yet again the old Baxter pessimism kicks in three-quarters of the way through a very interesting story and MASSIVE SPOILERS ALERTS......... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

It starts strong and has a great deal of fun science fiction concepts, space travel, and alien lifeforms. It has your typical mixed cast of people both good and bad. Baxter brings to life the life forms on Proxima C. and makes it into the highlight of this book. I never really bonded with any of the characters and had a hard time staying focused. At the 70% mark in the book, things get very political and doom and gloom to a point that I lost interest. The book covers the story of a group of former convicts stranded on a planet orbiting Proxima by the government and forced by the government start a colony. This was a mixed bag of typical Baxter quirks. Great world building, but random, distracting info-dumps. Interesting characters, but it's mostly all head and little heart. I expect these from a Baxter novel. I enjoy reading him, I just wish sometimes he'd go off formula a bit more.

A rare please :-) For me science fiction is at it's best when tackling big questions, or for tight character led stories, and we are fortunate in having both here. There are a few big issues being tackled here, such as how humanity tackles resource scarcity post significant climate change. It looks at how we expand into the Solar System, from a practical, and from political perspectives. And perhaps the main one is how we explore, and then colonise another star system. In answering these challenges with well researched consequence the author builds a believable world encompassing humanity's future. Although the binary nature of the politics does lack the nuance you'd expect for such events. Beyond that he constructs an alien world that is plausible and fascinating. The alien ecology is drawn with respectable detail and I loved the main life forms of the builders. They struck me as a novel creation, and one that managed to feel alien, as well as understandable. There's a strong blend of characters here, including human and AI. For the human characters Yuri really stood out for me. He possessed a practicality, but also a sense of being out of his own time that appealed to me. Even better are the various AI characters, they each had their own characteristics that demonstrated being of a different order of intelligence, and personality, but also differentiated between each other. In particular the robot companion added some feeling to the colonisation threads. Set against all this is a somewhat esoteric mystery relating to a discovered energy source, and some trapdoors. The applications of these are explored, but their meaning is only hinted at in this book. I've already bought the next book in the hopes of finding out more! ...more When most sci-fi authors write about aliens they think how evolved their brains and how advanced their civilization might be and that they probably want to kill us and take over our planet.

This scientifically When most sci-fi authors write about aliens they think how evolved their brains and how advanced their civilization might be and that they probably want to kill us and take over our planet. Stephen Baxter in his novel Proxima shows the most possible form that extraterrestrial life could take: not creatures that look like humans but with weird eyebrows and pointy ears using only their logic, but animals like those on earth, with strong instict, adapted to their own ecosystem. This scientifically explained description of life on a hypothetical exoplanet is the most remarkable thing about Proxima. There is also the hint of the existence of creatures more intelligent than us who were here before us, but that idea is not fully developed, even though it gives more depth to the whole book. The building of the strange yet fascinating alien ecology of Per Ardua is not only creative and imaginative, but also based on science sufficiently enough to make it feel like an ecosystem like that could actually evolve to exist on an exoplanet with these properties. See, as much as I enjoy the exciting but implausible ideas of Star Wars-like space opera, a scientifically realistic book like Proxima leaves me totally satisfied. Other hard sci-fi elements in the story involved kernels, tiny black holes releasing energy, interstellar pathways in the form of hatches, alternate realities (Stef's sister), colonization of the Moon, Mars and Ceres and intricate political events. The plot was very interesting and I really liked how the narrative alternated from the past to the future to give a better understanding of the setting. The characters were likeable, smart and quite diverse and their personal growth by the end of the book noticeable, while leaving enough room for further development in the sequel, Ultima. Everything in the book was skillfully combined along with a really good writing style to make up a thought provoking and compelling read that is definitely worth a try by anyone who hasn't read it. ...more die b\u00fccher von stephen baxter (auch die schw\u00e4cheren, wie etwa \"flux\") sind immer eine reise in die grenzen der imagination. das erstaunliche daran ist, dass dabei wissenschaftliche tatsachen auf derart phantastische weise extrapoliert und als grundlage f\u00fcr ideen herangezogen werden, dass im untergrund der narrativen struktur fast etwas poetisches aufschimmert, das ich in keiner anderen SF je so gelesen habe. sicher, baxter hat seine schw\u00e4chen: die menschen, die er auftreten l\u00e4sst, werden n\u00fcchtern die b\u00fccher von stephen baxter (auch die schw\u00e4cheren, wie etwa \"flux\") sind immer eine reise in die grenzen der imagination. das erstaunliche daran ist, dass dabei wissenschaftliche tatsachen auf derart phantastische weise extrapoliert und als grundlage f\u00fcr ideen herangezogen werden, dass im untergrund der narrativen struktur fast etwas poetisches aufschimmert, das ich in keiner anderen SF je so gelesen habe. sicher, baxter hat seine schw\u00e4chen: die menschen, die er auftreten l\u00e4sst, werden n\u00fcchtern und mit wenig detailverliebtheit beschrieben - aber es sind eben nicht die menschen und charaktere, um die es im kern geht, sondern die wissenschaftlichen ideen, die baxter beschreiben und erfinden m\u00f6chte, und das tut er sehr gekonnt und mit einer geistigen beweglichkeit, die ihresgleichen sucht. in \"proxima\" wird ein planet kolonisiert, der sich in einer umlaufbahn um proxima centauri befindet. die erdregierung geht dabei sehr inhuman und kurzsichtig zu werke, was dazu f\u00fchrt, dass der plan fast schief l\u00e4uft. aufgrund der intervention einer weit h\u00f6heren intelligenz als der menschlichen geht die besiedelung dann doch voran, w\u00e4hrend aber auf der erde politische krisen viel umfassendere probleme hervorrufen. \"proxima\" ist lediglich der erste teil eines doppelromans: \"ultima\" ist momentan noch nur auf englisch erh\u00e4ltlich, aber ich werde die fortsetzung sicher schon lesen, bevor sie auf deutsch \u00fcbersetzt wurde - ich kann einfach nicht erwarten, wo diese geschichte noch hinsteuert! ...more Not sure what I was expecting this to be like \u2013 the publicity suggested I might like it\u2026 but I found it more like Exultant than Coalescent .

Proxima is halfway between hard science fiction, Kim Stanley Robinson , and space opera, Peter F. Hamilton . It's entertaining but despite the cliffhanger at the end I'm not very tempted to continue with Ultima . 3,5 stars A bit uneven at times, but epic in scope and an overall great read. Excited for the sequel. Sci-fi fans probably already have an opinion of Stephen Baxter's work and no doubt whatever that opinion is they would have the same with this book. Personally I love his books and this is ones of the best so far. Set in the 22nd century, it sees a group of people forced to travel and live on a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to our own.

Personally I love his books and this is ones of the best so far. Set in the 22nd century, it sees a group of people forced to travel and live on a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to our own. Whilst some of the solar system has been colonised, this is the first time humans have lived on an exoplanet and they are normal people forced to be abandoned on an unexplored planet with fairly limited equipment. This part of the story was particularly amazing. On the one hand there's great world-building as Baxter invents a whole alien ecosystem complete with its own fascinating species. And then there's the battle for survival on the planet, against the environment and against each other. Beyond main character Yuri, we have no idea who is going to make it. There's an almost Lord of the Flies feel to it, except these are adults who have been forced into the situation by other people and most of them want to find a partner. It's a brutal vision of colonisation. There's also a fair chunk of the story set in the Solar System. This deals with two principles really- the political landscape of the future Earth and the conflict between the UN and China as well as investigations into mysterious things that suggest the presence of alien life in the universe. I love Baxter's vision of the future Earth in this book- it's not a pleasant one by any means but takes a lot of the current international politics and imagines how they could potentially play out. I thought there was lots of things that felt familiar from Baxter's other work- colonisation (The Long Earth), a manipulating AI (various), a rich space tycoon (Time)- but the book was still quite different from previous books. It takes some of the best ideas and tells a new story, half hard sci-fi about surviving on a new planet, half an almost-2001 sense of mysterious alien force. It all comes together really well and ends with a stunning cliff-hanger that makes me very keen to read the next book.

Acabei a leitura com as \u00faltimas linhas a merecerem um WTF? (adequado \u00e0 leitura em ingl\u00eas), n\u00e3o de espanto positivo mas sim de ... (tradu\u00e7\u00e3o para portugu\u00eas da express\u00e3o WTF) \u00e9 isto? Se h\u00e1 um livro em que o fim me arruinou a leitura geral, aqui est\u00e1 ele. \u00c9 aceit\u00e1vel que nem todos os mist\u00e9rios de uma hist\u00f3ria sejam desvendados, mas se o mist\u00e9rio principal n\u00e3o for resolvido, esse v\u00e1cuo narrativo tem de ser preenchido pela resolu\u00e7\u00e3o satisfat\u00f3ria dos enredos secund\u00e1rios mais relevantes. Neste livro, tamb\u00e9m isso deixou a desejar. Assim, um livro que me poderia merecer umas (quase) 4 estrelas, se a conclus\u00e3o cumprisse a premissa do mist\u00e9rio, s\u00f3 n\u00e3o leva 1 estrela por favor \u00e0s partes interessantes da cria\u00e7\u00e3o do cen\u00e1rio e algumas personagens. Por causa do fim (que, para mim, \u00e9 arrancado do cu com um gancho), 2 estrelas. ...more<---C>Stephen Baxter</---C>", "Title": "Proxima"},
