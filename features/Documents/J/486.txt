But Coetzee uses this character in a much more dazzling and unsettling way, the same way Beckett uses his characters to inch closer to the terrors of black nothing. EC can\u2019t be dismissed as a \u201cmeta-character\u201d because she materializes with the same fullness as any other character in the book. Coetzee puts in work to give her the same physical gestures and sensory life of <---C>Paul Rayment</---C>. You don't quite know how to receive this woman. You empathize with her, you hear her rattling cough, but you also know she\u2019s mannered, overly handled by The Author. This makes you examine the idea of \u201ccharacter,\u201d and you realize there are only slight differences, at least in theory, between EC and the rest of the gang. I felt wonderfully weird reading this book. In The Life and Times of Michael K, Coetzee pulls a similar move in breaking the symmetry of the book, using a 1st person narrative that recounts the first \u00be\u2019s of the book told in 3rd person. This move itself wasn\u2019t what disturbed the reader. It was the position of this move, about 3/4's into the book. Huh? Cynthia Ozik considered this the only flaw in the book, but maybe I just see flaws as artistic necessities. What are we trying to do, make the perfect reproduction of the world? Or are we trying to bend light and distort so that the world can experience what the artist sees? I loved this book. ...more Fourth Coetzee book: what makes this possible, not getting bored by the same author's voice while reading Coetzee all summer long, is his outstanding talent for making the novel readable.

More so than \"Elizabeth Costello\" (that Nobel-prize-worthy novel, and my favorite of Coetzee's), the taking over of the protagonist's psyche is so complete that growing paranoid was never before perceived to be this much fun. The reader's sensibilities are likewise Paul's, and they both go mad together. Also taking contemporary issues (the social boiling pot that is South Africa; the differences in cultures, customs and lives) he does yet another masterful genre-splice: the tricky postmodern Murakami-meets-Saramago turn: Elizabeth Costello's (the writer's) strange presence in this (his next) novel...! Is it me or was the question set forth \"What happens when the character in a plot meets it's writer/creator?\" (Plenty of modern masters have tried to set a foot in Borges's metafictional terrain.) \"<+++>Slow Man</+++>\"'s awkward yet shocking finale sets the record straight: This novelist can do it all...! ...more This review originally appeared in the San Jose Mercury News: When you've won every possible literary award, including the Nobel Prize, you're entitled to indulge yourself a little.

He refuses This review originally appeared in the San Jose Mercury News: When you've won every possible literary award, including the Nobel Prize, you're entitled to indulge yourself a little. That, at least, is my explanation for how J.M. Coetzee came up with this fascinating flop of a novel. ''Slow Man'' begins with Paul Rayment, a photographer who lives in Australia, losing a leg in a bicycle accident. The 60-year-old Rayment, who lives alone and has no close family, descends into bitterness. He refuses to have a prosthesis fitted and crankily dismisses a series of visiting nurses until he finally finds one, a Croatian woman named Marijana, with whom he can get along. Then gradually he realizes that he's falling in love with her, which is something of a problem because she's married and has three children. At this point, about a third of the way into the book, we have few hints that this will be anything other than a conventional novel, albeit one animated by Coetzee's superb ability to make us feel the pain, rage and frustration that a Paul Rayment must feel. Then into Paul's life (if we can call it that) walks the novelist Elizabeth Costello, who informs him, ''You occurred to me -- a man with a bad leg and no future and an unsuitable passion. That was where it started. Where we go from there I have no idea.'' Both the reader and Paul are perplexed as to why this aging woman has suddenly shown up at his flat and announced that she's moving in. (''I will be a model guest, I promise. I won't hang my undies in your bathroom. . . . Most of the time you won't notice I am here. Just a touch on the shoulder, now and then, to keep you on the path?'') All he knows is that she's a famous writer: ''He tried once to read a book by her, a novel, but gave up on it, it did not hold his attention.'' We know -- or probably should, anyway -- that Elizabeth Costello was the title character of Coetzee's immediately previous book, published in 2003. And when she quotes to Paul the opening sentences of ''Slow Man,'' we begin to get the idea: He's a character in a novel that she's writing. And both of them are characters in a novel that Coetzee's writing. And once you've stuck your head into that metafictional and metaphysical maze, there's no turning back. Elizabeth Costello turns out to be an amusingly irritating and didactic busybody. She dominates the middle part of the novel, as she tries to get Paul to resolve the impasse in his life -- and her novel. She's mostly passive-aggressive, but occasionally she interferes directly, as when she sets up a liaison between Paul and a mysterious woman whom she brings to his flat. Paul and the woman make love, though neither can see the other: She's blind, and he's blindfolded. This odd incident is a narrative dead end. It has no effect on Paul other than to make him reflect on how he's become the author's puppet: ''Or might the Costello woman be writing two stories at once, stories about characters who suffer a loss (sight in the one case, ambulation in the other) which they must learn to live with; and, as an experiment or even as a kind of professional joke, might she have arranged for their two life-lines to intersect? He has no experience of novelists and how they go about their business, but it sounds not implausible.'' As Paul's exasperation with Elizabeth Costello grows, we get a kind of reverse spin on Pirandello: not six characters in search of an author, but one character trying to escape from an author. But there's only one way Paul can escape from Elizabeth Costello, as she explains to him: ''The sooner you settle on a course of action and commit yourself to it, the sooner you and I, to our mutual relief, will be able to part.'' In other words, if a writer creates a character, it's up to the character -- not the author -- to work out his or her destiny. ''For me alone Paul Rayment was born and I for him,'' she says. ''His is the power of leading, mine of following; his of acting, mine of writing.'' But for all the hall-of-mirrors cleverness of making an author and her character interact as characters in a novel, Coetzee has simply rung a change on an age-old novelistic convention: the omniscient narrator. No, George Eliot didn't wander around Middlemarch nudging Dorothea and Ladislaw into action, but the effect of having an author who knows what's going on in her characters' heads isn't very different from what Coetzee winds up doing here. Once you've accepted the premise that fiction is something that somebody makes up, and that it has a complex relationship with what we call real life, you haven't gone much further than most of us do when we take our first college lit courses. ''Slow Man'' finally rises out of the muddle of metaphysics to become a story again, working out Paul's increasingly complicated relationship with Marijana and her family, especially her teenage son, Drago, for whom Paul mistakenly tries to become a surrogate father. And Elizabeth Costello becomes more than just a meddlesome authorial fairy godmother: She has her own story, a set of personal problems to work out in tandem with the ones that she has imposed on Paul -- or from her point of view, allowed Paul to impose on himself. But by the time the novel's ending arrives, it feels tired and anticlimactic, as if too much thinking about fiction has sapped the life out of it. ''Slow Man'' is undeniably perceptive about many things, and throughout it there is the pleasure of watching a brilliant mind at work and play. But when a novelist gets too self-conscious about writing a novel, he or she probably can't give us what we really want a novel to do: feel like life -- unmediated life. ...more I read far more than was necessary to finally determine this book was not worth reading.

I was embarrassed for all aging men and what they might become if served heaped on a plate filled with leftover mediocrities. I have no idea what possessed a man of such talent as Coetzee's to write this drivel and why he allowed it to even be published. The text is nothing short of despicable and I doubt the experience will wash completely off me. But I will rub and scrub with the harshest of detergents and hope the cleansing chemicals will somehow save me instead of causing a more deadly cancer to grow. But after reading two-thirds of this I cannot imagine what that could be. ...more One of my pet annoyances is writers who say: \"oh, I just start writing and my characters get up to the most unexpected things all on their own, I just let it happen!\" What that translates as is: \"I don't have a plot to speak of or any structure but I have such faith in my own vast (albeit undiscovered talent) that I don't feel I need one, so I simply write pages and pages of free-flowing pure invention [tedious drivel] instead.\" Slow Man is what happens when you let your characters write the book One of my pet annoyances is writers who say: \"oh, I just start writing and my characters get up to the most unexpected things all on their own, I just let it happen!\" What that translates as is: \"I don't have a plot to speak of or any structure but I have such faith in my own vast (albeit undiscovered talent) that I don't feel I need one, so I simply write pages and pages of free-flowing pure invention [tedious drivel] instead.\" Slow Man is what happens when you let your characters write the book for you. NOTHING. They fanny around, make a cup of tea, think about some irrelevant stuff and then sink back onto the sofa in a slough of despond. Halfway through the book the situation becomes so desperate that you introduce a meta-fictional alter-ego writer character to prod them along (at which point your readers politely applaud how clever you are) but by this point its too late and you can only write a book about how characters don't really do anything when left to their own devices. If you're an exceptionally brilliant Nobel-prize-winning writer you might just get away with it but if not I'd recommend one of those 'what's your character's arc?' worksheets. They're really rather helpful. ...more \"The blow catches him from the right, sharp and surprising and painful, like a bolt of electricity, lifting him up off the bicycle.\" Paul Rayment, a photographer in Adelaide, finds himself in a hospital recovering from a bicycle accident, with one leg amputated above the knee.

He refuses a prosthesis and opts for nursing care. After going through a succession of nurses, he develops feelings for a Croatian nurse, Marijana, a married woman with three children. In addition to his loss of independence and the problems of aging, Paul is coping with loneliness and regrets over never having children. He attempts to have Marijana and her children play a major part of his life. The first third of the novel seems realistic. Then the novelist Elizabeth Costello shows up at Paul's door, an annoying woman who he has never met. (She is a character from J.M. Coetzee's previous novel.) She starts reciting the passage at the top of this review, \"The blow catches him...\" When she first heard those words, she had asked herself, \"Why do I need this man?\" Elizabeth Costello seems to be a stand-in for the author Coetzee since she knows all about Paul and the other characters. She uses her knowledge to try to prod Paul into action. At the same time, Paul is feeling that she is using his reactions to create a character for a book that she is writing. She's a persistent woman, constantly visiting, although he keeps trying to get rid of her. Paul, who immigrated from France to Australia as a child, is working through his feelings about home, about belonging, and about love. After a career as a portrait photographer, Paul seems to be thinking about who the man in his own mirror is as a person. The reader is watching Elizabeth Costello interact with Paul as she gets material for the story that Coetzee has written and we are reading. While it's a creative idea, it also moves the story from a realistic plane to a position where the reader no longer knows what is real and what is unreal. But that's Coetzee--an author who has fun playing around with the readers' minds. ...more C\u00f3 th\u1ec3 n\u00f3i m\u1ed1i quan h\u1ec7 gi\u1eefa t\u00f4i v\u1edbi cu\u1ed1n s\u00e1ch n\u00e0y l\u00e0 m\u1ed9t m\u1ed1i quan h\u1ec7 y\u00eau-gh\u00e9t.

This seems to be Paul's problem; when he reflects on his life, he feels he has accomplished little and is particularly bothered by the fact that he is childless. Despite my appreciation of the main character, I agree with many of the other reviewers, in that I found the addition of the magical author character rather incongruous with the first half of the novel. She was distracting. I found myself wondering whether she was real/magical, whether she was necessary to the story, and whether the main character suffered some sort of closed head injury in the accident. These thoughts made it difficult to concentrate on what should have been the central themes of the novel: aging, intimacy, meaningful engagement with others, accomplishment. ...more So many have already pointed out the contradictions in this novel that I won't repeat them.

I found that as the book went on(and on and on) I got a bit tired of his whining and self absorption, and was just wanting the book to be finished. Elizabeth was an odd addition to the book, I couldn't quite figure out whether she was an angel of sorts or what; it was all a bit confusing. In real life it would be very disconcerting, of course, to encounter a person who could read your very mind. In this book, perhaps she served to make him more aware of things, as mirror as it were, to make him face himself and his attitudes. Interesting that he covers his bathroom mirror, so as not to see the reflection of his physicality. Also, I was not fond of the sexual encounter with the blind girl. Perhaps I am not sophisticated enough, in the world of literature, to understand the function of that little tryst. It did not seem to serve any purpose in the story, it was brief and there certainly wasn't even a hint of eroticism to the account of the act itself. It could have been cut from the book and never even missed, in my opinion. Then it ended, abruptly and in my opinion, unsatisfactorily. I am not sure what I expected, but I thought, \"What, that's it?\" Generally, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. All in all, I found it depressing and that it did not have any redeeming features. ...more This is the first novel of J. M. Coetzee after he won the 2003 Nobel Prize for Literature.

Coetzee has that flair in making his characters behave and speak unbelievably: you would not know what will they say the moment they start moving their lips. Brilliant thoughts. Mesmerizing vocabular. Thought-provoking insights. The only reason why I am not giving this a 4 or 5 star is the disappointing ending. The last 20 pages seem to be hurried. I just had that feeling that J. M. Coetzee just wanted to close the story by delivering the moral lesson: not to be too quick in judging people.

Then he falls for his home care nurse (a Croatian named Marijana, which I take it is pronounced Mariana), which is also interesting. Then all of a sudden some other woman shows up and it gets weird and like Adaptation/magical realism-y, but not in a good way and not in a way that the previous 100 (or whatever) pages lead you to believe was going to be happening. This woman seems to be a symbol for the author himself (although yes he is a him), but basically is a 'writer' who somehow just 'shows up' and 'knows everything about the main character.' I don't know why I'm putting those things in quotes, as they aren't quotes but more summations although she says a lot of stuff about it. But anyhow, look, I loved Adaptation and Charlie Kauffman's magnificent mindfuckery as much as the next person, but you know from moment one with him that things are over your head and nutty. You know what terrain you're in. This one, not so much. You're going along with a normal, interesting story about a pissed off amputee and then suddenly things totally go off a cliff to 'random woman shows up, no explanation, just decides so stay, he never asks her to clarify herself, suddenly she's bringing blind chicks he met in the elevator to come pork him and he's not questioning that either, but also going along with it when author lady who says she dreamed of him or he came to her or some shit like that also says he needs to wear a mask and also be blind when blind lady comes' and basically screw that. You can be nutty, you can be normal, but don't you tell me you're going to be normal and then suddenly be something else entirely. In short, I got sick of it and lost total interest and damn it life is too short and I just got a lot of awesome books for my birthday so I'm going to read them instead. Maybe she's not a faux author deus omniscienta (I made up that phrase, but I like it), who knows. All I know is I got rapidly and dramatically too annoyed to find out.

Bad luck, unfortunate accidents, life-changing events, and according to popular culture, or just to Lifetime or the Hallmark channel, or hell, even according to some more pretentious sources, these incidents are...well, a number of things, but more popularly the perspective is that once all is said and done, these life-changing events become opportunities to see what is really important in life, but that always, always there is a choice to continue to live life to the fullest, to make the most of it, and we should be happy, and feel lucky, to be able to do so, right? Because there are always those less fortunate...and we hear and see those stories, don't we, of people who overcome those obstacles and we can read about them in books like Chicken Soup for the Soul, or Reader's Digest, I guess, if we ever wanted to...and then when it happens to you, or someone you love, what? What? What then? Push on, strive, overcome, there are those less fortunate, you can still have a good life, right? The Slow Man questions this mentality. No, no, I'd say it pretty much takes this mentality and hacks it up with sharp objects and says, WHAT THE FUCK? And what happens when we need to make decisions for ourselves about things like that, and we make poor ones, or we are slow, slow, slow to make them? ...more This is my first Coetzee book and I'm not sure I should have started with it. It begins beautifully, with a dramatic life changing accident described with sparse, clear, and compelling prose. But then it quickly degenerates into a series of encounters that are increasingly bizarre and ridiculous.

It begins beautifully, with a dramatic life changing accident described with sparse, clear, and compelling prose. But then it quickly degenerates into a series of encounters that are increasingly bizarre and ridiculous. I have no idea what Elizabeth's appearance in the book accomplishes other than to repeat what the main character, Paul, has already expressed previously and to act as some sort of bantering (and annoying) angel figure. Her presence let alone her ubiquitous understanding is never explained and we're expected to just play along, but it was jarring to begin with and then got (much) worse. I also don't believe that the sequence of events following the \"inappropriate love\" made any sense. For example, without giving anything away, the conversation Elizabeth conducts with Drago about his mother and Paul is infuriatingly dumb and shows absolutely no understanding of family politics and psychology other than the author's allowing Drago two lame protests to \"ask his mother please.\" Or the cohabitation scheme Elizabeth comes up with - which is so ludicrous that even bringing it up made me hate the book even more. The colonial and patriarchal and macho and procreation attitudes didn't help either. There are innumerable examples of this throughout the book, and too many other strange and incomprehensible happenings to mention all of them. I thought Slow Man would be about mortality and love, as told by an old man who suddenly loses his independence. But it appeared to be a vehicle for Mr. Coetzee to spout some crap about needing to seed the world and being self indulgent and grumpy while he's doing it. At least it wasn't boring, and I did think some of the meditations on immigration (not the brown people to white land ones, which were hackneyed and stereotypical, but the white people to other white lands ones) were interesting. And thank god it wasn't long. ...more There is something mysterious about love -- it stems from physical desire, intimacy and projections, and perhaps something else that will never be defined. In Coetzee's Slow Man , we are invited to the world of Paul Rayment, an elderly Frenchman living in Australia who ends up with an amputated leg due to an unfortunate incident. He is stubborn and laments over his fate, refusing to get over the fact that he is pretty much an incomplete individual. Enter his Croatian nurse Marijana Jokic, married There is something mysterious about love -- it stems from physical desire, intimacy and projections, and perhaps something else that will never be defined. In Coetzee's Slow Man , we are invited to the world of Paul Rayment, an elderly Frenchman living in Australia who ends up with an amputated leg due to an unfortunate incident. He is stubborn and laments over his fate, refusing to get over the fact that he is pretty much an incomplete individual. Enter his Croatian nurse Marijana Jokic, married with three children, who he subsequently falls in love with. Enter, also, Elizabeth Costello, a novelist who turns up at his doorstep because he \"came to her\". Elizabeth seems to be prophetic and she seems to know everything; she analyzes Paul's motivations and lays out his choices with reasonable explanations. Eventually, she offers Paul a choice : either to be with her, two old people, each lacking in their own ways, providing care to each other, or to confront Marijana and sort out the chain of events that ensue due to his own proclamations of his love. The story reaches its logical conclusion -- Paul has been somewhat blinded by his love all along, and what he imagines as possible or probable turns out to be wrong or improbable. But still, he does not follow Elizabeth Costello, and hence, we return to the question of love and its constitution and our need for it. My only gripe about the novel was the mysterious introduction of Elizabeth Costello as a character. Perhaps Coetzee was trying to do a metanarrative thing by introducing a writer, who serves as Paul's conscience, into the narrative, but Elizabeth Costello's abrupt entry and her mysterious origins efface the impact of the analyses that she gives. The best thing about it has to be the end, the playing out of events as expected, and the twist that comes after. ...more This is an odd little book, no question. Paul Rayment suffers a terrible accident whilst cycling along the road in Adelaide, Australia. And falls in love with his caretaker. That's where the book takes the unexpected turn.

I enjoyed this book, although I could easily see where it would flummox people quite easily. What helps (or perhaps hurts) is that Coetzee's ability to toss off amazing sections of prose keeps us in the dark so well about the nature of the book. A lessor writer would be seen through at once, and the reader would be able to experience the book knowing full well the ground they stand upon. Coetzee, on the other hand, masterfully keeps us mired in shifting sands, forcing the reader to continually reassess and wonder any number of questions including even whether or not the protagonist in fact died in the accident, or whether or not he even exists outside someone else's imagination. Hardly anything is simple, or as it seems, or perhaps it is. Coetzee might not satisfy you, but he's well worth reading. This little book is no exception. ...more I love this account of Coetzee by the writer Rian Malan: \"Coetzee is a man of almost monkish self-discipline and dedication. He does not drink, smoke or eat meat. He cycles vast distances to keep fit and spends at least an hour at his writing-desk each morning, seven days a week. A colleague who has worked with him for more than a decade claims to have seen him laugh just once. An acquaintance has attended several dinner parties where Coetzee has uttered not a single word.\" Of course Coetzee's wo I love this account of Coetzee by the writer Rian Malan: \"Coetzee is a man of almost monkish self-discipline and dedication.

They are not characterized by an overabundance of mirth. They are exquisitely crafted to bring the reader to an uncomfortable intimacy with life, its hard choices, ruthless randomness, consequences intended and unintended. Coetzee's writing is spare, I suppose it can be said, but there are layers of complexity to his books that will encourage you to pick them up again a few years later. ...more Is it the responsibility of Nobel Prize winners to showcase their brilliance or ensure a strong readership? If intelligent readers don't understand the author, what's the point? The Washington Post likened Slow Man to \"an episode of The Twilight Zone by John Barth,\" with the feeling \"that it means something important,\" even while this meaning remains elusive. Simply, Coetzee's postmodern literary trick overwhelms what could have been a provoking rumination on love, old age, and life.
