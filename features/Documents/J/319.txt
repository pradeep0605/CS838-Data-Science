(hide spoiler) ] The problem with a lot of Warrriors books is that the plot is nonexistent and all over the place. That is NOT the case with Firestar's Quest. There's lots of action to keep the reader entertained, and there's also some direction with these events. Events are connected, if that makes sense. Also, all my favorite characters are back! It was great to read about Firestar again. (view spoiler) [ I was very depressed after The Last Hope , so I needed to revisit my old friend Firestar (hide spoiler) ] . Sometimes, characters feel out of character in different books, but that's not the case here! The Firestar we know and love is back! Overall, I thought this was a entertaining, exciting and just AWESOME novel. Firestar's Quest is a standalone Warriors novel. It can be read independently of the main series but there are some references to events that happen in the main series. If you want some context to those, read these (in order) at the same time or before reading Firestar's Quest: Into the Wild Fire and Ice Forest of Secrets Rising Storm A Dangerous Path The Darkest Hour ...more OK, this book was awesome. I just spent while reading the book like this : After the massive battle with BloodClan, Firestar and the Thunder Clan cats are finally at peace. At least they think they are...... Firestar soon receives mysterious dreams constantly by the same plot: a grey cat with a wailing and screaming clan escaping and running away.

Firestar soon receives mysterious dreams constantly by the same plot: a grey cat with a wailing and screaming clan escaping and running away. When he realizes StarClan has hidden a forbidden secret of a forgotten clan, Firestar is furious and turns his back from the ancestors that he used to trust. How was he so careful about seeing his four clans across invisible borders but so blind about his own cats upstairs? Now he is coerced to make one of the biggest choices in his life: bring the clan back from darkness and guide them to the gleaming light. Should Firestar really give up being leader of ThunderClan for a while and be a mentor of the lost clan? Or should he remain leader and not betray his wealthy clan? In the midst of a trouble, an old friend comes and alleviates the situation with an important dream. This is the last sign of the desperate, old, grey cat who appeared in his constant dreams. Now, the responsibility is in his own paws. \"Firestar's Quest\" is such a suspenseful book; it is like a shattered puzzle piece going to be put back together, piece by piece. This 510 paged story really made me look a little closer again. If you ever read this book, you will be sitting at the edge of your seat! After reading this, you will never look at your pet cat again as a lazy, fat, piece of fur. Although lots of the chapters were really stalling the hidden answers, and I was so keen to find them, I rate this five stars because of the image the author paints in your head. Erin Hunter is great at creating stories and I could have never have the knack of she has, of writing the most unforgettable stories. People who love reading the \"Percy Jackson\" series will one hundred percent adore this book because the plot is similar but somehow different at the same time. ...more So, as with all of the Warriors books, I loved this one! But for different reasons than the others. My favorite part about it is easily the fact that readers can, once more, join Firestar on a quest. Don't get me wrong, I love Squirrelflight and Hollyleaf and the other main characters from the other series, but Firestar's just a classic. :) Tied for my favorite thing, is Sandstorm!

In the first series, I always felt that, though she and Firestar were mates and in love, there was never GREAT detail into their relationship and Sandstorm's character/personality in general. This book not only allows you to see who she really is, but just how in love she is with him, and just how far she's willing to go because of it (of course, there are other, sarcastic parts of her I like too). As to the main plot, it was great! But, and I almost hate saying this as a fan, but I wonder how relevant Skyclan is to the story, thus the point of this book. Now, in no way am I regretting this book being written or having read it! One just has to wonder (and hope :) ) if Erin Hunter is going to use the characters of Skyclan (new or the old) in a future series. Me? I sincerly hope so. ...more This book takes place after Scourge killed Tigerstar, but before Squirrelflight and Leafpool were born.

To me, Firestar's Quest was a great book and deserves 4 stars. Some positives include a good plot, an okay climax, and great characters.

Firestar is now in the gorge with Sandstorm learning SkyClan's history from Sky and his faith in StarClan has already been shaken. As for what i've learned, this has filled in a huge gap in the story for me finally. Same with the Mangas. They filled in gaps for me so i'm not so lost from time to time! Firestar`s Quest was about Firestar going on a quest to rebuild Skyclan. My favorite character is Firestar. My favorite part was when Skyclan was rebuilt and there new leader was Leafstar. The craziest part was when Firestar and Skyclan had a battle against the rats. I really enjoyed this book. Firestar`s Quest was about Firestar going on a quest to rebuild Skyclan.

Erin Hunter's books are great- but for some reason I have a lingering feeling that this one might not be her best works. *Spoilers Ahead Overjoyed that this was in Firestar's POV, mainly because he is the protagonist and I just adore him. When he got visions of the former leader of the \"abandoned\" Skyclan, I was wanting things to spice up a bit and be the perfect suspense and adventure story I waited for. I mean- doesn't the title, 'Firestar's Quest' get you curious? But, the author has to be like: NOPE, and make it slower. I still love Erin Hunter, she is awesome. Don't get too fired up with that statement, because she might of done that on purpose to make us even MORE curious and keep on reading to get to the juicy part. But in reality, some people don't like slow-paced, boring books that can enter into a yawn fest. *Plot time Absolutely loved the plot, and I ship Firestar and Sandstorm so badly. They were meant to be with each other. I'm probably just fangirling. ;) Anyways, when Firestar left Thunderclan in order to fulfill the quest and rebuild Skyclan somehow, I was thinking of his clan getting in some trouble. But when he was receiving a message from Sky, it kind of demolished that idea...since he said Thunderclan is not in any serious condition. Kind of weird, since it seems like he spent TWO YEARS in Skyclan, rebuilding it. I say two years for an exaggerated estimate, but it seriously feels like it. What did I tell you? The story is slow-paced sometimes. More about Sky's account. He dies. Woohoo. It seemed like the really fast part in the story. Sure, he was old- but I didn't think that he was that old that he would die on the next day. Echosong, reminds me of SpottedLeaf, Cinderpelt, and Yellowfang. I love that cat. Rainfur's death is kind of anticlimactic. He dies, everybody grieves for him for a couple of days, and then they don't care. I'm kind of surprised that his mate kind of moved on way too quickly for it to be even possible. I mean, everybody has to die soon, but he had kits with her and everything. Shouldn't they be a little bit more sad? *End It never really showed what Firestar did when he traveled back, like literally NOTHING. I guess the book is kind of too long anyways. In the sneak peek, I was literally over joyed when Sandstorm had pups. You know what that means? My ship is becoming true. Hooraayy. Over all, you should read it. Now. It just depends on the type of book you like and I am totally not forcing you to read or not read it. Your choice, completely. I would give it four stars, it had some goofs, but if you were a Erin Hunter fan, you wouldn't mind. *Please do not feel offended by this review and don't start a world war in the comments section. I've had some experience with those. This review is completely off my opinion. Don't read this review if you don't like it. If you still stayed for the spoilers even if you didn't read it, those are major spoilers and I don't think you'll be too happy. Anyways, good luck reading the book. :D ...more In Firestar\u2019s Quest, by Erin Hunter, Firestar strives to rebuild a fallen clan of cats. Firestar is the leader of ThunderClan, a group of cats.

When he gets a call from StarClan he goes on a mission to rebuild SkyClan to it\u2019s former glory. The whole deal with all the characters in the book being cats can be rather annoying though albeit an interesting twist. In this book, warriors are given names of nature things, including objects and living creatures. One of the characters, Echosong, has a name that defies this rule. Can cats understand a song? Do they know what an echo is? This is debatable. Over all I think Firestar achieves his goal too easily. Something as tricky as what he had to do shouldn\u2019t work out so quickly - or so well. It\u2019s like solving math problems when all the text book problems are easy but real life ones are hard and they don\u2019t come out evenly. Firestar also seems like the perfect character. He is nice, funny, smart, stands up for what he believes in, and is leader of his clan. He is, luckily, prone to mistakes and he makes a few. But too few. This character needs more flaws. Sandstorm, the cat traveling with him, also appears too perfect. She excels at everything she tries. Erin Hunter also uses the words \u201cblinked gratefully.\u201d Most people cannot blink gratefully at someone and cats certainly cannot. However, there are many positive aspects of Firestar\u2019s Quest. It is a slightly less than page turning book, the liveliness of the scenes and interesting plot twists make it a winner. The impossibility of the task StarClan sets before Firestar keeps you going, even when things seem to go too well. After all, you want to know how he does it. Firestar and Sandstorm may be perfect characters but others keep the dialogue from becoming dull. Cherrypaw and Sparrowpaw are often in conflict or competition with each other and others, giving some well needed comic relief. Sometimes Firestar is stupid which it is hard to imagine, but true. Firestar leads one of his clan mates to death because of his actions, saying it is for the best of the clan. Erin Hunter\u2019s golden boy may seem perfect on the skin but underneath many unwise discussions are made. The end is fulfilling and pleasing, but perhaps too settled and calm, almost drowsy. Firestar\u2019s Quest is overall a good read with some flaws that are perhaps somewhat exaggerated here. This book is a must read for anyone interested in cats or adventure. ...more Finally got to this super edition even though I've already read almost all the way through The Power of Three.

Firestar's Quest is perfect for people who can't get enough of Firestar, who was the original hero in the Warriors series. It also is a great filler for between Darkest Hour and Midnight even though it was published after Midnight was released (I think). Some say it was too long, but I think should it have been any shorter, it would not have had the same magic. I mean, it was such a huge job for Firestar! Finding cats for SkyClan, and then teaching them the warrior code. It had to take 500 pages. I loved all the recruited cats. I was devestated when Rainfur and Skywatcher passed away. My favorites from SkyClan have to be Leafstar and Echosong. Love them. My favorite part of the whole book was when Leafstar recieved her nine lives. I think it was so sweet, that the older leaders visited Firestar and co. and that the 'wrong' that was made so many moons ago, was finally righted. That was really touching. All in all, Erin Hunter does not disappoint in this adventure-filled novel! Made for lovers of the Warriors series. Although, you should not read this unless you've read at least the first series of Warriors . I love this book!

StarClan is where the Clan's ancestors go (among the stars). Their ancestors give them prophecies, clues and help for them to tell them the future, tell them the right way to go. Lately, Firestar was having strange dreams of cats wailing, crying for his help. He asked the medicine cat and his friends to help him solve it, but still, he could not solve the dream. He went to the special place-the Moonstone (where you meet your ancestors) and talked to his ancestors. He understood clearly now, the cats were a lost Clan-SkyClan from many years ago, the Clan was scattered, lost, Firestar had to rebuild the Clan, find them a save place to live. Firestar and his mate Sandstorm went on the quest, finding any cats who had SkyClan's power-jumping, a few moons later, Firestar and Sandstorm rebuilt the Clan, and they went back to ThunderClan, but with another confusing prophecy in Firestar's dreams.

In order to get to skyclan Firestar needs to travel far into the unknown territory, secondly skyclan was broken apart a long part ago and now firestar needs to gather the clan from the descendants of skyclan- rouges and kittypets! I thought this book was amazing because this book tells about the other more deep story of the warriors, this book branches out of the normal warriors series. Before I read this book I didn't know about Skyclan! As revealed further on, this book has some connections with the books after. I recommend this book to people who read the first series of warriors because the plot is set right after the first series. Thank you for reading my review! ...more This book has today disappeared from my list of currently being read and consequently I have lost the date I began, so have had to guess roughly as to when.

It is set around a time of peace between the warrior clans (wild cats) As the blurb on the book cover tells us, Firestar is the Thunderclan leader and sets out on a quest to discover a truth in order to right a wrong. Although Erin Hunter's books are aimed at youngsters I know that adults including me who are animal and nature lovers also enjoy reading her books. I am not ashamed to tell you that I already have lots of her books on my shelves. The adventures of the clans are easily read but beautifully written and full of myth, magic and fantasy. This is the most recent one purchased and I already have another ready to buy - also a stand alone story. ...more !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!caution spoiler alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! firestar's quest by Erin Hunter I really liked this book because the author did a great job painting a picture in my mind. I especially liked the part when skyclan went to fight the rats in the barn and how they did a great job describing the battle. I rely like how they get you hooked to the characters so when one of them dies you kind of feel sad inside and feel bad for the characters that were close to the one that died. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!caution spoiler alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! firestar's quest by Erin Hunter I really liked this book because the author did a great job painting a picture in my mind.

I also like the part when the author described the giant wave that washed sandstorm away from firestar for a while. I think the best part is when leafstar gets her nine lives from starclan and how some cats from the starclan from the forest come to. ...more This book is facinating. I like that in this book Firestar proofs to his mate (Sandstorm) the he may have like Spottedleaf (medicine cat when Firestar joined the clan) but no longer did. Ofcourse Sandstorm did't believe this until Spottedleaf (alredy dead) told her that she to loved Firestar but their relashionsihp could never be good.

What forced them to leave there new home, and be driven out so that the Clan was forgotten? Can Firestar rebuild the lost Clan? Or will it remain lost forever? ...more In the beginning this story was a little slow, and I felt that the caves were reminiscent to the book where the 4 clans were driven out of their homes. Firestar received a Message from the mysterious 5th clan of the forest. His faith in Starclan was shaken,as he believed he was lied to. The 5th clans ancestors asked Firestar to right the wrongs of the past and restore the 5th clan. Firestar and Sandstorm went on a long journey. I loved the ending and I hope we see the new clan again! OMG I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH IT IS LIKE MY FAVORITE OF ALL THE WARRIOR CAT BOOKS IT IS SO AMAZING!!! Ok so basically, Firestar sees a cat in a puddle and some clouds and goes on a epic journey with Sadnstorm to find a dead clan- SKYCLAN. i want to say more, but i dont want to ruin everything, so i REALLY want you to just go read it. RRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I liked this book because, in the New Prophecy series, Firestar is a grouch, and in this one he isn't. Although one part I didn't like was the prologue. I think it told to much in the beginning. I think it would have been better to keep Sky Clan a mystery. I kept thinking, \"come on Firestar, when will you discover Sky Clan. Wow, I was worried that leaving the safety of the forrest for a full 500 pages wouldn't be much fun but I was wrong. Regenerating the clan that once was was such a hearwarming and at times heartwrenching (Sky!!) story. I loved it and was sad to see Firestar and Sandstorm return home again. Although I am looking forward now to the kin of their kin and what they'll have to offer! Awesome! Awesome! I love this book. I was so glad that Erin did a super edition about what happened after the battle with scourge and Bloodclan . I was so happy to find out that there was a 5th clan in the forest, besides Starclan. I loved the book a lot and I recommend it to anyone who loves the Warriors Series.<---C>Firepaw</---C>", "Title": "Firestar's Quest"},
