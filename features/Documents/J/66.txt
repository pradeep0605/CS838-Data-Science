I highly recommend this book and this author, who demonstrates a unique insight into the spiritual realm. ...more I have read this author's work before and liked it so it was with anticipation that I grabbed up this book.

This story offers up a unique experience as far as I was concerned. I loved reading a story that was partially set in Romania and was written by a Romanian author. The paranormal aspect was unique as far as that genre goes too. This wasn't about a vampire, werewolf, demon or any other popular paranormal creature. It was about an inexplicable experience. The crisp, clean writing style set the tone for that experience to appear all the more mysterious. The story flows gently with spikes of action, but the crisis point comes unexpectedly. It was an engaging read. Gerard Leon is a Frenchman and a doctor living in London. He works at a children's cancer clinic where he works on cancer cures. He has found a promising method for one type of cancer and the treatment has been moderately successful. One day, he enters the clinic to find a beautiful woman sitting down and playing with the patients. He recognizes her as the famous Italian sculptress and recent divorcee, Linda Coriola. His heart is warmed to see that she really cares about the kids and isn't just making a publicity visit to look good as a big donor for the clinic. She is so beautiful and he is smitten. Linda is gun-shy around men after her experiences with her Ex and growing up with her parents splitting up and both remarrying. She has determined to keep her heart locked away and maintain her independence. But the handsome Frenchman doesn't seem to be taking the hint each time she pulls away. Not that she fights too hard when he takes her for ice cream to a cute cafe and talks to her of his work, when he visits hers home and is eager to know her and seems so appreciative of each moment they spend together. Gerard knows that Linda is holding back and he re-doubles his effort to show her that his love is real. They visit his mother and aunt, he goes with her to her art exhibition where they run into her Ex, and then they share that unforgettable adventure in Romania when she accompanies him to check out a doctor-friend's research idea and end up brushing up against the paranormal. But then a misunderstanding takes place and Gerard is finally convinced to let her go. This was a love at first sight story, but the relationship is not that simple. The hero is open and strong with his feelings and commitment. The heroine is fearful and tentative. I admit to getting frustrated with her several times. I will excuse her a little by admitting that her ex-husband did a real number on her psyche, but only a little because Gerard gave this relationship his all. Not really sure what he could have done differently to convince her. That being said, I enjoyed their love story. I enjoyed that they appreciated each other's talents and shared the same cause when it came to the cancer. The domestic scenes were cute in their homes, his mother's home and his friend in Romania's home. Their passion was tender and sweet. And you know that no matter how slow the relationship took, there was no problem with the physical- not with a Frenchman and an Italian woman as the love interests. It's a little spicy, but not full on description. The author did a good job giving readers a scorching hot hero to appreciate in Gerard who has that attractive French accent,<---M> flirty good-nature</---M>, smoldering passion for Linda, bold green eyes and dedication toward his work. What's not to love there, right? The paranormal aspect of the story was very enchanted forest stuff taking place in the Romanian version of the Bermuda Triangle. I enjoyed the feeling I had reading this portion. And speaking of Romania, it was fun experiencing their adventure as the scenery, food, history and people were described. It wasn't pedantic because it was all viewed through Gerard and Linda's eyes. To sum up, this is a nice refreshing change for a paranormal romance that I would recommend to those who like a little something different now and then in that genre and don't mind things light on the paranormal and more sweet than spicy on the romance. My thanks to the author for providing the book in exchange for my honest review thoughts. ...more **I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review** <---A>Melinda De Ross</---A> is becoming one of my favorites. I love the way she writes, its so elegant and flows beautifully off the pages when I'm reading it, and I can totally picture everything she is writing. Like her first novel that I read Rendezvous with Hymera, Gerard & Linda are a human couple who go through a paranormal experience. Which I think is an excellent concept, its something we can imagine really happening, especially **I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review** Melinda De Ross is becoming one of my favorites.

Like her first novel that I read Rendezvous with Hymera, Gerard & Linda are a human couple who go through a paranormal experience. Which I think is an excellent concept, its something we can imagine really happening, especially when it comes to ghosts or anything like that. Gerard & Linda meet at the clinic where he treats cancer patients who are children, he's also discovered a treatment for a form of skin cancer and is still researching to find a cure. Linda is a sculptor who has recently moved to London, though she would always visit the center prior to her move, she's getting over a difficult divorce and doesn't give in too easily to the doctor. While still in the beginning if their relationship, they travel to Romania so Gerard can confer notes with another Doctor who is doing the same research. In their travels they get lost and come across a creepy forest and have a very strange experience with a woman, which can potentially change their view of paranormal phenomena. I thought this was an excellent read. This is probably going to sound creepy lol, but I feel like I connected with the author and the story . I'm not sure if its because of the Italian characters and references or her style of writing, but I felt like I was home. When she describes Romania I felt like I was back in my little town near Naples going shopping with my mom or aunt, lol. And when she mentions the song Strani Amori by Laura Pausini, I definitely had some memories of my time in Italy, lol. So I finish with this question; Has this ever happened to you, as you were reading the book it was like you connected with the author as well as the story? ...more Love between an Italian girl and a French man would be as intense as what Linda and Gerard have in this book. I felt the joy of the first stage of romance which I had long forgotten, but nevertheless pleasant to remember. The details of each romantic episode were fascinating enough that I wondered if there was really any need for the paranormal plot. However, the author had chosen to use the paranormal as a metaphor for the upcoming difficult phase of the relationship of the two lovers. \u2018Hope\u2019 i Love between an Italian girl and a French man would be as intense as what Linda and Gerard have in this book.

The presence of animals, cats in this book, provides reality to the book. The author can make mute animals convey thoughts through her sheer writing, the skill I hope to see her apply more to human characters in her next book. She must have been a good journalist that Linda and Gerard explain their thoughts articulately, which is not always necessary. The author can trust her own perceptive writing more. And last, I ought to warn you that this book will make you want to cook a great rich European food. Forget dieting. ...more An unconventional kind of paranormal romance.

The two encounter something odd in the forest on the way to his friends home. Gerard and Linda fall for each other pretty quickly, but as with most couples have issues to resolve before they can fully commit. Gerard is a hot Frenchman who loves his mom. Who doesn't love a guy that loves his mom and French to boot. Linda is divorced and a bit skeptical of her feelings as well as Gerard's feeling. Her ex-husband left her with many insecurities. The paranormal aspect was an unusual twist, but was woven into the story. The author's descriptive writing was well done and painted beautiful scenery. I would recommend this book to romance lovers with a bit of paranormal. ...more Very enjoyable read.
