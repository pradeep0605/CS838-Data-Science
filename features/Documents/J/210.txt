This is set fifteen years after the Red Ship wars and King Verity\u2019s reawakening of the Dragons. Tom Badgerlock is the person Fitschivalry has evolved into: the one he always wanted to be; he is the man with a simple life, a small farm, a few friends and the close companionship of his loyal wolf. His reaction is unsurprising when his former mentor and friend comes seeking his help: reluctance. Prince Dutiful, heir to the Farseer throne, has gone missing.<---F> Nobody seems to know why</---F>. He is suspected of having the Wit and is known to have an undeveloped grasp of the Skill. Tom Badgerlock doesn't want to go back to being the tool of the Farseer throne, their Assassin. Who can blaim him? He wants to be free. Slow, but excellent Few authors of the fantasy genre, if any, could write a book in which the first third of it is essentially the protagonist living in a hut looking back on his youth as he weighs up the decisions of the future. In this <---A>Robin Hobb</---A>\u2019s style is remarkable. The internal conflict of Fitz really spoke to me. Fitz has earned his rest but at the same time he is the only person who can bring stability to the realm: he must go back to Buckeep and the role of his youth. The novel is very well paced and probably the most apprehension evoking I've read in fantasy; the author knows how to draw the plot out, revealing more information at exactly the right time. The plot could have been over and done with, in three hundred pages or so, but that would not have achieved the same effect. The emotions of Fitz, his fears and worries, all play a pivotal role in establishing the suspense of the plot and only through his vivid characterisation do we, as the reader, understand the meaning behind his decisions. Wonderful Magic A theme has been established through the book, through the use of animals, almost defining the author\u2019s style. The thoughts of animals have been brought to life; their personalities exhibit their animalistic traits. For example, the cat\u2019s snobbish nature and vainglorious attitude to itself is captured in the thoughts it sends to Tom Badgerlock. This is my favourite aspect of the series: the Wit magic. It is a wonderful idea. The relationship between Fitz and Nighteyes is very touching. Their bond, along with the Fool\u2019s closeness to them, is very deep. They are almost one person as their wit bond has rubbed off characteristics onto each other. The Wolf thinks like a human and the Man acts like a wolf. I liked this development and how it becomes tested as Nighteyes ages quicker than Fitz. Robin Hobb is one of my favourite fantasy novelists, third only to Tolkien and Susanna Clarke, her books define the modern fantasy genre, thus they're a must read for any fantasy enthusiast. ...more *I dedicate this review to Nighteyes; a Witted wolf born to rule a pack.

They leave me entirely speechless, every time. You'd think with a series this long, it would eventually get tiresome, but with Hobb it never does. Ever. I don't want to delve too much into the storyline; spoilers are something I do loathe (I had this friend, who promised certain things weren't going to happen in the novel and they did!! Damn you Zomo!) and so I'm going to discuss my viewpoints on the central characters instead. So without further ado, drum rolls please... Fitz/Tom \"My dreams were thin, illogical human things now that frayed at a moment's waking. Tears flooded warm under my closed eyelids. (view spoiler) [I can't believe, I cannot even begin...Fitz and Nighteyes were my heroes. To go on without their duo is unthinkable! I don't want him to bond to another animal! I want Nighteyes and Fitz! *weeps* (hide spoiler) ] Ever since the Farseer trilogy, I have loved Fitz. His character from the beginning promises readers of an exciting and deep narrative voice. Watching him develop and grow throughout each novel is magical, you very much become Fitz. There were so many moments in which I couldn't separate my views from his, as though I was trapped within his situations. I'd genuinely get stressed out even after leaving the novel. It was brilliant! Starling. *People restrain Halima as she has a hockey bat aggressively pointed towards Starling* F*cking Starling. Warning: There will be many profanities within this section, please shield your dainty ears. F*cking, f*cking, f*cking absolute trollop!!!! I HATE HER SO F*CKING MUCH! JEEEEEEZUS.

It's actually really fun to read about, the Fool always teases Fitz about it (hide spoiler) ] In short, the Fool, Lord Golden, the White Prophet is one of my favourite characters. I am very much looking forward to reading more about him within the trilogy. And now, to Nighteyes! We are pack. I love, love, love Nighteyes. He was hilarious and adorable. His viewing of their 'pack' was the sweetest and his loyalty to Fitz never failed to bring tears brimming to my eyes. Many of my favourite parts within the novel were solely just his quotes, they are the best. \"A few days without me and he's consorting with horses. I might have known.\" \"Good hunting. I'm going now, my brother.\" \"Here's the dead wolf. Might as well bury him, all he's fit for is to lie about in a dusty yard and watch chickens he's not permitted to kill...\" (view spoiler) [His death! Oh my goodness, I can't believe he's dead. Simply writing this makes me upset, oh good God. What was beautiful was the way Hobb wrote it. It was poetic, it was heart breaking, it was the perfect ending to Fitz and Nighteyes. Rest in peace Nighteyes. (hide spoiler) ] To close: Would you recommend this to Fantasy readers? Yes, though be sure to read the Liveship Trilogy first (which is also a very, very good set of novels). Will you carry on reading the trilogy? Who ever asked such a question, most certainly I will. What else do you advise? Be sure to have tissues and ice cream on the side, it is a rollercoaster of a read. *5 I love Nighteyes for ever and ever stars* My review to the Tawny Man, Book 2 [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more Again, Robin Hobb demonstrates that you don\u2019t need to write grimdark to generate realism, high drama, or sinister undertones.

You just have to know what is going to happen next. That was my experience anyway. The story begins at a leisurely pace as we catch up to Fitz in his self-imposed exile some 15 years after the events of the Farseer Trilogy. We get a taste of what a life of peace with his wolf Nighteyes is like. I make it sound boring but it\u2019s not. Fitz has been to some interesting places and done some interesting things in those 15 years \u2013 including a visit to Bingtown and the Rainwilds which those fans who have read The Liveship Traders series will appreciate. If you\u2019ve skipped that Trilogy to come straight over to Tawny Man then I think you are missing out. Most people do it because they want more of the Fool \u2013 more Fool you I say \u2013 because there is more Fool in Liveships \u2013 so technically that would be more Fool to those who read Liveships first? Damn Fool bastard has me talking in circles. But back to the Bastard \u2013 Robin Hobb(no I\u2019m not calling her a bastard) still manages to reintroduce us to an older Fitz and catch us up in a way that is interesting despite being slow. Even when Fitz is doing nothing, I still wanted to know what he was going to do next as his old life calls out to him. And the pace and tension keep increasing from there as Chade\u2019s old apprentice Asssassin is called on to do his duty for his Queen and the Farseer throne. And in Robin Hobb\u2019s world, duty is spelled \u201cP-A-I-N.\u201d So though we know Fitz can\u2019t die, seeing the story is told from his POV in the first person, we should know by now that he is never safe. We should know by now that there are worse things that can happen to Fitz than dying and we should know that Robin Hobb does not hold back from inflicting them on our protagonist. Did I just say Robin Hobb isn\u2019t a bastard? 5 stars And now a quick word from out sponsor Lord Golden Fitz is Dutiful to Fitz\u2019 Dutiful ...but what is Dutiful\u2019s Duty? Should Dutiful be Dutiful to Dutiful ...or should Dutiful be Dutiful to Duty? What so Beautiful seduces Dutiful ...is Duty not Beautiful enough? Will Fitz's Duty bring Beauty ...or will Fitz' duty be rough Psst - Fool says Robin Hobb really is a bastard ... bitch ... sadist ... get off me, I'm the White Prophet and I will be heard . Fool says you should read her next book as soon as possible. ...more This is more or less what I look like whenever FitzChivalry Farseer is involved: So many books later, and I\u2019m still feeling \u00fcberprotective of Fitz.

She writes very factual, very matter-of-fact but it makes the reader react in a very emotional way. You get upset, you want to shout at the characters, you think they are the silliest person on earth, but the next moment you\u2019re grinning from ear to ear and everything is all right with the world again. I love it. Apart from the invasion of your emotional kingdom, there are two other things that make me love these books so much: One, the characters are so real, it\u2019s almost surreal. This includes the animals, I was so impressed with the simple things Robin Hobb does to bring the cats to life for instance. \u201dPet me, you\u2019ll feel better\" That does feel so cat-like. Two, the way she writes her stories and keeps you guessing. What happened? How did we get there? Is there still a way out of here? Who\u2019s the girl he keeps talking about? Did Nettle tell about her dreams at the breakfast table, and if yes, what did her parents think of that? (And I can keep going like that for a few pages if need be) Seriously, I dread the day I run out of Robin Hobb books to read.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more Do not you sense it?

The truth , I discovered, is a tree that grows as a man gains access to experience. A child sees the acorn of his daily life , but a man looks back on the oak. She then spends the remainder of the book turning your opinions on their head as her characters change and evolve in very real ways as events unfold in this fabulous world she has created. Some speak of the savagery of beasts. I will ever prefer that to the thoughtless contempt some men have toward animals. It is the work of an amazing author. She doesn't need to keep your attention with epic battle scenes, but maintains it more subtly with stunning language and unforgettable characters. ...more Entre dolor, soledad y desconsuelo trato de escribir estas l\u00edneas para intentar describir lo que me dej\u00f3, o m\u00e1s exactamente lo que me sac\u00f3, este libro.

This series relates a lot more to the characters from the initial Farseer books such as Fitz, the Fool and various other characters, both old and new, who are local to Bukkeep.

This series relates a lot more to the characters from the initial Farseer books such as Fitz, the Fool and various other characters, both old and new, who are local to Bukkeep. We are told that the main character (first-person again) of Fitz is now 35, so it's about 15 years after the Farsser series. As we follow Fitz we don't actually know an awful lot about the life he's been leading for the last 15 years. We haven't seen or heard of him since the ending of Farseer, and so a large amount of the beginning sections relate Fitz's tale and what he's doing now. We see he's living with a young boy who he cares for greatly, and we learn some of the daily life chores for his new persona, Tom Badgerlock. After the initial re-immersion period the actual story kicks in introducing us once more to characters we knew from long ago and many new characters who will also begin to play a new role in the Elderling Realm. Fitz's story starts off slow, but quickly he's drawn to change his pace and take on new challenges and meet new people. The story flies away with itself from that point on. I was wary of returning to Fitz after severely disliking his character and the way he made so many mistakes and blunders in Assassin's Quest (Farseer #3). I found that even though I had really enjoyed Fitz's struggles and character up to that point, he bored me and annoyed me so much in Assassin's Quest I wasn't sure if he was going to be a character I would enjoy reading about anew, luckily my fears were quickly put to rest. As Fitz is so much older and wiser by this book - he has matured and had a life - he makes for a much more likeable character, less inclined to childish mistakes and folly. In the Farseer books we follow a young boy with many secrets, harsh alliances, and different strings attached to him, whilst in Tawny Man, Fitz has had time to reflect on that period of his life and decide that he knows better now. As for the story itself I felt that this one was much better paced and far more fun than the final Farseer one. Clearly the different approach to writing which Hobb adopted for the Liveship books allowed her to hone her skill and master the pacing and structure of her Fitz storyline too. I felt compelled to read this fast, and see where it was heading. I wanted to immerse myself back into the world, and find out the consequences of the events of the Liveship books and the Farseer books. Overall my only slight criticism of this book was that, although we learn a lot throughout this book about new and old characters and the magic of this world, I didn't feel that there was as much mystery or anticipation surrounding certain elements of the plot. In the Liveship books we can see hints and ideas which link into Farseer, and whilst that's still sewn throughout this book, I felt that this was more of a set up for the next book of the series than a fully fledged book of its own. I think that the next two books will more than likely incorporate more of the elements of mystery and wonder I am seeking, and hopefully as a whole the trilogy will make its mark next to the Liveship books. I enjoyed reading this immensely, and I look forward to continuing and finding out more about the state of the Elderling Realm, the opinions of the public on the ending of this book, and finally the new characters who we've been introduced to more in this book. 4*s overall. ...more Another great book about our hero Fitz. I especially love reading about him for some reason, and this book was no exception. I can't go too much into the story since it's a continuation of the long series Robin Hobb has created, but I can say that I liked how we get to follow Fitz at an older age - and I LOVED that this novel contains cats :D I'm definitely going to continue on with this series once Autumn really sets in. <+++>Fool's Errand</+++> picks up 15 years after the events of Assassin's Quest .

There's a few new characters that I liked, mainly Prince Dutiful. He reminds me of Fitz in many ways but more mature. Hobb's characters are so nuanced and substantial, even the antagonists. I enjoyed spending time with everyone. The real star of the book is Hobb's writing. She's descriptive, moving, and engrossing. I'm to the point that I'll read anything by Ms. Hobb. I'm glad I didn't give up on her after Assassin's Quest . Her characters have stuck with me and have becoming some of my all-time favorites. 5 out of 5 stars. ...more This is my third time of reading this series and it still remains my absolute favourite!

This is an old favorite that, for years, I had planned to re-read. Since Hobb\u2019s new book comes out next week, this seemed like the perfect time to get back into FitzChivalry Farseer\u2019s world. We first met Fitz back in Assassin\u2019s Apprentice when he was a boy. As bastard son to a Farseer prince, he was brought to court and trained as the king\u2019s assassin. He inherited the Skill, the magic that the Farseer family uses to communicate telepathically, from his father. Unfortunately, he inherited the Wit, the maligned \u201cbeast magic,\u201d from his mother. He has had to hide this magic, and his wit-bond with his wolf Nighteyes, from others. Folks in the Six Duchies are suspicious of Wit users and often burn them at the stake. The next two FARSEER books, Royal Assassin and Assassin\u2019s Quest, follow Fitz as he grows up, learns to use and control his powers, falls in love, and does the ugly duties that are required of the king\u2019s assassin. By the end, Fitz has served the Farseers well, but he\u2019s lost just about everything in the process. I remember how devastated I was, years ago, when things didn\u2019t turn out well for Fitz. A few days later I found out that Fitz\u2019s story wasn\u2019t over. As soon I realized that it continued in Fool\u2019s Errand, the first book in the TAWNY MAN trilogy, I immediately sent my husband to Barnes & Noble. (I had the flu that day.) I don\u2019t think I was ever so happy to get my hands on a particular book, and I felt that way again when the audio version showed up unexpectedly at my door a couple of weeks ago. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu! And so Fitz\u2019s story continues. For the first half of Fool\u2019s Errand, we see Fitz and Nighteyes in their little home in the wilderness. Fitz is 35 years old and he\u2019s been away from court for fifteen years. Almost everyone, including the woman Fitz loves, thinks he\u2019s dead. Occasionally Fitz gets a visit from someone at court who urges him to come back. He is a Farseer, after all. Finally, Fitz is convinced to return when Prince Dutiful goes missing and the Witted Piebalds are suspected of being involved. (You can read the Piebald origin story in Hobb\u2019s recent novella, The Willful Princess and the Piebald Prince.) Fitz\u2019s partner on his quest to find Dutiful is his best friend, The Fool, who he hasn\u2019t seen in years. The brilliance of the FARSEER stories is that Fitz feels so real and evokes such sympathy due to his circumstances that I am content just to be around him, even if he\u2019s doing nothing more exciting than feeding the chickens or fixing the roof. I just want Fitz to be happy and content and to find a place where he belongs. I suppose I might get bored if Fitz fed chickens for 700 pages, so at just the right time Hobb takes him away from his cozy little home and he goes off to have an adventure. First we get to revisit Buckkeep, where Fitz grew up. Then he\u2019s off to find Prince Dutiful. His quest is dangerous and he uncovers a plot that is sure to result in a major political upheaval. In the end, Fitz loses out again and it\u2019s clear that his old comfortable life with Nighteyes is over. It\u2019s devastating. And now we have another boy to worry about: Prince Dutiful. In many ways his situation is similar to Fitz\u2019s. This is the series I recommend first to anyone who asks me what they should read. But if you don\u2019t want to get involved, I won\u2019t blame you. FitzChivalry Farseer\u2019s life is one of the most bittersweet (emphasis on \u201cbitter\u201d) stories in epic fantasy. He struggles with his identity as an orphaned bastard. Now that he\u2019s an adult, he knows the importance of having a father, yet he has sired two children who he can\u2019t be a father to. He has been bullied from all sides and has been hated and mistrusted because of the Wit. He has been overworked nearly to death by the people who should love him most. He deals with addiction and difficult moral choices. He loses so much. In the entire world there are only a couple of people and one wolf who truly understand and love Fitz. That makes these few relationships so powerful, which is part of the beauty of his story. James Langton narrates Brilliance Audio\u2019s version which is 25 hours long. I loved his voices for all the characters and I\u2019m looking forward to re-reading the next book, Golden Fool, in this format. I really hope it arrives soon. ...more This is my third Robin Hobb book. The previously read ones were 4 and 5 stars. This particular book is only three stars for just two reasons.

First, because they are just so wonderful, I want to enjoy them for a while. But second, because they're a serious time investment and I have a constant stream of books coming into and out of my life, needing to be read. But it was convention time, and Ms. Hobb was the guest of honor, so what better experience than to be reading one of her books while hanging out in the same hotel? I figured I'd get the story of The Fool. Looooooove. These. Books! I have been trying to parcel these out to myself. First, because they are just so wonderful, I want to enjoy them for a while.

I figured I'd get the story of The Fool. I was expecting to read back through his life and experiences. Right off, with delight, I saw it was Fitz instead, the continuation of his adventures. So, happy me, finding nooks and corners and hallways and bars, read this the whole weekend, finishing it in three days while still socializing, dancing, gaming and all the other things that need to happen at a con. Plus I had it signed by the author while only making a slight fool of myself (pun totally intended). As Fitz gets older, his story resonates more and more as we get closer in age. Where he was impulsive and willful in his youth, he's plausibly weary, happy to be stuck in his routine while he heals from his traumas, yet still with every spark still lit, and just enough wisdom to decide what to bring into his new life and what baggage to leave behind. Anyway, this is the first book of the third trilogy, I lived and breathed it for three days, and it will stay with me for a lot longer than that! ...more I see that I still haven't reviewed this, and I'm already 40% into the second one. Well, there isn't a lot to say, really. If you like Hobb and her previous two trilogies about the Elderlings Realm, you'll want to continue. Here, we're back to the first person narrative of Fitz himself, and it's great to catch up with old friends. The story itself is decent enough, but what struck me about this particular book was the slow build.

Hay demasiados puntos de este mundo fant\u00e1stico que pueden ser aplicados sin m\u00e1s a nuestra realidad. No solo los ardides pol\u00edticos y las traiciones que se esconden detr\u00e1s de cortinas, sino la discriminaci\u00f3n y el prejuicio que sufren los Ma\u00f1osos vienen a ser, en mi opini\u00f3n, un paralelismo con aquellos que nosotros mutilamos simplemente con los estereotipos de la sociedad.

The first time I read Fool's Errand, I would not have given it 5 stars. I read it when it came out--actually before, since I had the advance. I wanted to know what happened to Fitz and his friends so desperately, and the story doesn't go anywhere fast. I finished it disappointed and dissatisfied. And Robin Hobb tends to backload her books.

I read it when it came out--actually before, since I had the advance. I wanted to know what happened to Fitz and his friends so desperately, and the story doesn't go anywhere fast. I finished it disappointed and dissatisfied. And Robin Hobb tends to backload her books. I noticed starting with this one, but Ship of Magic suffers from it too. It seems as though it is hard for her to get started and there is time more or less spent hanging out in the world with her people before the plot really gets going. In Fool's Errand, hundreds of pages go by before the story really begins, and I was too impatient for that even though I truly enjoyed the time spent with the characters I loved. I minded that much less this time, in fact it was like relaxing in a literary hot tub...soothing, comforting, enveloping. I knew the ride we were in for and I was glad to take the respite before it started and savor every moment as the characters did. Also, on this reread, I was able to dive into book after book, and finally I understood what her purpose really was: Robin Hobb is writing the most brilliant love story ever told in fiction. At least in what I've ever read. What makes it brilliant is both its ambiguity--even the gender of one of the characters can be argued--and the line it explores between platonic and romantic love and what happens when love transcends the conventional and is pushed beyond the safe and familiar boundaries we all know, largely set by Hollywood. This is the stuff that we dream of, that has fired the imagination of many a storyteller, but no one gets it quite right. Robin Hobb nails it. I will hedge this somewhat to say that the wonderful thing about Robin Hobb is she never tells the reader what to think. Her stories are so layered and complex that each reader can find what is important or interesting to him or her, and it can vary widely. This was the standout for me, but another may find a different aspect more compelling. There is so much going on, both above and under the surface, and regardless, the sort of relationship she decribes doesn't work unless there is a real story beneath it. Which there is. The main plot follows logically what has happened in her world before and what would be the next step given the events in Bingtown as detailed in the Ship series. Political unrest and backlash against The Witted pull Fitz back into Buckeep's politics and he and The Fool are soon on the trail of a missing Prince. ...more Astounding. More please!

The Liveship Traders is my favourite trilogy so far, as Assassins unfortunately failed to capture me in quite the same way. This was mainly due to the fact that Fitz (the protagonist) annoyed me somewhat. In the Tawny Man trilogy, I expected much the same thing - that although I would love the plot, the detail, the depth of the characters and the sheer imagination, I would be disappointed by Fitz himself. I wasn't. Fool's Errand reignited my love for this saga, as well as made me fall in love with Fitz as a character for the first time. It astounds me that Hobb can create characters that are constantly changing and developing, all the while remaining true to who they were at the start. Fitz is a shining example of how a (somewhat angsty and petulant) child can grow to be a likeable, damaged but stalwart man who you root for and care about deeply. Don't even get me started on the Fool and Nighteyes... words cannot describe the depth of what I feel for them. As always, Hobb weaves a fantastic tapestry of plot, character development, symbolism and foreshadowing that leaves you not only desperate for more, but also wondering if she has some kind of superpower. I have no criticisms - absolutely none. I'm actually going to cut this review short, as I'm eager to start The Golden Fool, but rest assured that if you're thinking of reading this book, you're on the right track to experiencing true talent in storytelling. You're also on the right track to experiencing mild trauma, grief and some occasional panic, but it is all very much worth it. Hobb broke my heart in this book and I'm just about to eagerly pick up the next one. Read it. Do it now.

It was almost like enjoying his comfortable life was a well earned and just reward for what happened to him as a child. Being drawn back into the world of royalty seemed inevitable because of his children, his friendship with the Fool, and the decline of Nighteyes. He needed to find a new reason to live, and becoming a teacher seemed right to me. The plot really began much later in the book, and while I don't have a problem with that, per se, I did feel a little like the later action was an afterthought. Or the pastoral was only a means to make sense of the later action. Either one or the other was fine, but together I was left with an odd disjointed feeling. That being said, I still really enjoyed the characters and the direction it's taking. I'm still very interested in seeing the developments. ...more I had lost my taste for swords-n-horses fantasy until a few years ago, when I was persuaded by many enthusiastic recommendations to read George R. R. Martin's epic fantasy series. I enjoyed it so much that I began to sample this genre again, and Robin Hobb is one of my favorite discoveries of this year. I can see where not everyone would enjoy these books. They're long and slowly plotted, with more character development than action.

The medieval setting is pretty standard and there's nothing particularly unique about the system of magic. Also it takes a while to stop being annoyed over some of the silly names. But good writing wins out over all, and I find Hobb's writing completely absorbing. This is the first book of the third trilogy set in the same universe. I think you need to read the Farseer trilogy before starting this one, but you could safely skip over the Liveship trilogy - not that it isn't a good read. ...more Lo de esta mujer s\u00ed que es Habilidad y Ma\u00f1a para escribir. \u00a1Vaya librazo!

Full Review Like all the previous books in the Realm of the Ederlings books, this starts off slow without much indication as to what the main plot will be. In a lot of books this would annoy. Fantasy in particular tends to ramble on, especially some of the extremely long epic fantasy series. Ms. Hobb is different somehow. I'm not bored or anxious or wondering when she'll just get on with it. I'm excited to follow Fitz around discover what he's been up to while I was reading about pirates and magical ships. The return of several characters from the Farseer trilogy brought a smile to my face. It was like catching up with old friends. Ms. Hobb can be quite cruel to her characters, especially poor Fitz. As the catalyst he seems destined to lead a tragic life where his choices are always between bad and worse options. I was particularly sad when (view spoiler) [Nighteyes died. (hide spoiler) ] The books involving the Wit make me want a pet. I've always been more of a dog person, than a cat person. These books make me want a wolf, because Nighteyes is awesome. Despite this the addition of cats to this book from the previous trilogy is a welcome one. The cats talk and act like I'd expect them to if I could share their thoughts. I particularly love the comments from the Hedge Witch Jinna's cat Fennel. He cracks me up. Overall an enjoyable book that looks to be setting up nicely for the rest of the trilogy. ...more Fifteen years after the last trilogy, an older Fitz is living in a small home with his son and his wolf Nighteyes.

I wanted to know everything that happened to Fitz since last I had seen him. I had not even realized that the plot was almost nonexistent in the first 200 pages. As is Robin Hobb's style, there was no gore or massive amounts of magic or destruction. What makes her books so entrancing is that she doesn't need all the gore or magic to make it enjoyable or suspenseful. She presents wonderful characters....Then she puts them in danger and awful situations that have your heart pounding. She is a master at making the reader feel sad then happy then sad then happy. Robin Hobb is evil. So glad I decided to pick up the Fitz books again, and I can't wait to read the next one. ...more Find this and many other reviews over at Geekritique !

Robin Hobb has written many books in her far-reaching Realm of the Elderlings series. Her most notable, perhaps, would be the novels chronicling the life of FitzChivalry Farseer, the bastard son of Prince Chivalry and all the trials and struggles beset him. Fitz is one of the most tormented souls in all of fantasy, giving even the Starks a run for their money. Introduced first in the Farseer trilogy, Fitz' story continues in the Tawny Man trilogy, the first book being Fool's Errand. My first thought, before even beginning the book, was 'how on earth could this poor kid's story continue? Hasn't Hobb beaten all his life's tales out of him by now, physically and mentally?' The answer to that is to buffer this trilogy by a span of some 15+ years. Fitz no longer goes by that name. Rather, he calls himself Tom Badgerlock now, for a number of reasons, but most notably because FitzChivalry Farseer is supposed to have died many years prior. That makes sense. This divorcing himself of his prior life is something heartbreaking in and of itself. Tom Badgerlock is no one, with little to his name, except for an orphaned bastard and an old wolf. We learn much of his life within the past 15 years right off the bat. He trained himself in his use of the Wit magic, which allows him to communicate ever deeper, mentally, to animals - particularly his bond animal, Nighteyes, a wolf. This proved difficult, especially because he was not raised amongst those of the Old Blood, but he manages. The first few chapters of the book do tend to drag on more than they should, but noting the length of the rest of the novel, this is understandable. What makes Hobb's storytelling so brilliant is that you don't honestly need to have read the previous trilogy of books to jump into this one. She recounts all the major portions and loves and struggles of Tom's past life as Fitz so well, there would truly be no confusion on the reader's behalf of what happened. Although this is a fresh story in a new time period, I don't know why anybody would ever wish to not read the prior installments however. Get on it! The immediate threat of Prince/King Regal at FitzChivalry's back is no longer present, and the fear of Outislander ships Forging coastal towns has been abated. A new threat is stirring in the background, something that has potentially been brewing for many, many years. The Wit is a hated magic amongst those who do not have it, and it isn't uncommon that these ones will burn Witted folk alive if they are discovered. Now it appears a militant rebellion has sprung amongst the Witted, many calling themselves Piebalds, after the dark legend of the Piebald Prince who was Witted himself. Tom is adamant about not coming out of reclusion, despite entreaties from old friends and family. It isn't until the young Prince Dutiful is seemingly stolen that Tom chooses to become a servant of the Six Duchies once again, but can he keep his secrets? Or will the world find out who he truly is? This book, like all of Hobb's storytelling, does an incredible job at making humanity appear so small amongst such a large and wonderous world. So much is to be discovered amongst these pages that doesn't directly impact this story, and you know it must deal with future installments, as she lays down seeds like no one else can. This world is so real and so vivid, it's a wonder it took me so long to get back into. I stopped reading this series just before I got married. It was so torturously good, I was actually becoming unnecessarily stressed out. Now that sufficient time has passed, I can gladly get back into this series. But don't be mistaken. This is a return to form, and you will cry before the book is through with you.

Fool\u2019s Errand is the first book in Robin Hobb\u2019s third trilogy in her Elderling Series and is an epic fantasy in first person. The first trilogy, Farseer Trilogy, is one of my favorite trilogies of all time and Fitz, The Fool, and Nighteyes are some of my favorite fantasy characters. I was excited to see what Fitz and The Fool have been up to since the first trilogy. Unfortunately, that was mostly what this first book, Fool\u2019s Errand is all about. It is first a refresher of what happened in the Farseer Trilogy and a \u201ccatch the reader up\u201d on everything that has happened in the last 15 years. The only reason I still enjoyed this \u201ccatching up\u201d on things is because of my close connection to the characters. If it was another book, I would not have been so forgiving. This is so much a setup book. I realize that a lot of the first books in trilogies are set up books but this one felt extremely setup. As a reader I have a great understanding of what is going on in the Six Duchies and our characters because of this massive setup but I can see this being a slow and uneventful book for some. The plot of Fool\u2019s Errand is really simple. It is about getting someone back that has run away. Someone, that I can\u2019t mention due to spoilers of the first trilogy, has run away from Buckkeep, and Fitz has to find that person. It is an extremely simplistic plot that only has the purpose to inform the reader on the current political and social climate of the kingdom and to delve into the current emotions and thoughts of our characters after the 15 year absence. I found this a bit disappointing but was still happy that we got some deep character insights too. Hobb, more than any other author, writes this first person Fitz narrative with such depth and emotion, that we can then understand Fitz on a level that few authors can communicate. What is special about Hobb\u2019s writing of Fitz is the level of detail that is given to the individual relationships that Fitz has and how they are different from each other. Each relationship has its own meaning and feelings for Fitz, and it is the closest to real life relationships, in description, that I have come across in fantasy. I enjoyed Fool\u2019s Errand but it is such a setup book that I can\u2019t really give it an amazing rating nor a bad rating without reading the rest of the trilogy. It is very much a part of the greater whole and can\u2019t stand on its own. 3/5 15/25 Possible Score Plot \u2013 2(O.K.)

I am so glad to have rectified that however because I never knew what I was missing until delving into this treasure trove of a book! This book takes place about fifteen years after her Farseer Trilogy, but no worries if you havn't read that one before starting this. She does a fantastic job with setting up the story and the worldbuilding so that you don't feel left in the dark. And speaking of worldbuilding...Robin Hobb is an absolute pro at this. There was so much descriptive detail with everything, I couldn't help but feel as if I was experiencing everything along with the characters, which is such a fun experience when you are reading fantasy. And the characters. *sighs happily* Don't even get me started on how much I adore Fitz. His bond with Nighteyes made me tear up on a number of occasions, and you could really feel how strong their relationship was. Every moment of this book was just remarkable, and while at times it seemed that Robin Hobb could be a bit long-winded and took awhile to get to the point at times, it was all worth it in the end to just get to experience her wonderful writing style and I loved getting lost in this story! ...more Robin Hobb's writing is brilliant. She goes into so much depth and detail with the characters and their interactions that even though this is a fantasy universe, the characters seem so real. The conversations are some of the most realistic I've read and the dialogue is incredibly well done. For roughly the first 200 pages we are catching up with Fitz and not a whole lot really happens. I don't think any other author could do this and make it as interesting as Hobb does. She manages to be captiva Robin Hobb's writing is brilliant.

I don't think any other author could do this and make it as interesting as Hobb does. She manages to be captivating while writing about absolutely anything. As a reader I become completely immersed and engrossed in the book and all the little aspects of daily life. The characters really make Hobb's books stand out to me. The Liveship Traders is one my favourite series and it's because I get completely invested into these characters' lives. This is no different, though you do only get the one point of view character. Assassins Quest was my least favourite Hobb book (I still liked it) but this one is a improvement in terms of pacing and storytelling. It's much more concise and well plotted. I still really like the magic in this world - there's no flashy spells or anything like that - it's all in the mind and that makes it infinitely more interesting to read about rather than a wizard shooting fireballs. It says quite a bit that I read this as quickly as I did. I started about a week ago and I just couldn't keep away. I highly recommend Robin Hobb's books, she's an awesome writer. ...more I really enjoyed this story. I have wanted to read a book by this author for years, and finally got around to it. I did a buddy read of this and don't remember exactly why we started here. This story takes place 15 years after another trilogy that starts with Assassin's Apprentice . I'm actually glad we started here. While there were a lot of references to the \"past,\" I really enjoyed getting to know the characters at these ages. Now, before we go on, we will go back and read the first one. I'm e I really enjoyed this story. I have wanted to read a book by this author for years, and finally got around to it.

The story has a slow build but we really get a sense of the characters, their world and the connections they have to each other. The author has created an interesting world of human and animal connection. Throw in some magic and a castle and I was hooked. There is action and also a bit of heartache, all of the things I love! Looking forward to spending more time with these characters. ...more", "Title": "Fool's Errand"},
