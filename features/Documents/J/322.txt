The writing was AMAZING, and the story flowed like a catchy song.There was a cute and wonderful twist that had me smiling like a fool. This story also touches on the subject of rape in a very tasteful and classy manner, all while undeniably conveying the seriousness of this horrid offense. I was pleased to see that this issue was not glossed over and was handled with a delicate but effective grace that kept the story from taking a turn towards the dark side... Above all things fun and enjoyable in this sexy read was an important message of personal strength, forgiveness, and hope. This book has, without a doubt, become one of my unforgettable favorites!

It says something about a book that can do that do you. Easy surprised me right from the start with a very troubling scene of Jacqueline being attacked, making my heart jump into my stomach. And I'll admit to being worried about how Webber would handle such a delicate topic. But I think she did it very well and touched on many of the myths that are attached to rape. But Easy showed not only how a victim feels after an attack, but how a family copes and how a community reacts. And if there is anything I've taken away from the story it's that I need to enroll in a women's self-defense class in the near future. This book was filled with so many moments that just made me sigh inwardly or cheer on. The playful banter between Jacqueline and Lucas during their email exchanges was incredibly sweet. The scene where the sorority leader gave that speech on rape had me in tears. And the entire ending was just sheer perfection! But I will give a warning to some: There are a few disturbing scenes and if this is a trigger for you, it may be best to skip. It's been a while since I've added a book to my all-time-favorites shelf. This book was so powerful, so amazing, so emotional. When Jacqueline was attacked in the beginning I was like: Then she had to endure being harassed by that asshat again and endure shame from the student body, I was like: Then another girl is attacked and that fucktard RUINED her and people were concerned about his reputation, I was like: At that point, I needed to take a break, because this book was tearing me up inside. Some of this happened: Okay, okay. Maybe some of this too: Then Lucas and Jacqueline get into a spat and I'm like, \"WHY??????\" *SORROW* THEN SHIT GETS REAL... AGAIN and I'm like: By the end of the book, I'm in a glass case of emotions and I'm like: So basically, what I'm trying to say: The highest of recommendations.

Not one single friend rated this book less than three stars and I couldn't manage to rate it more than one. I feel like I read a completely different book from everyone else. The only positive thing I can say about this novel is that it emphasizes the message that rape is never a woman's fault, which is an important message. But having a good message does not excuse awful characterization, unrealistic plot points, or poor writing. Warning: Incredibly long review that attempts to justify my outlier rating. Brutal honesty ahead. My chief complaint about this novel is Jacqueline's unrealistic reaction to being sexually assaulted. In short, it doesn't seem to have the kind of impact on her thoughts or behaviors that I would expect. She shows no fear or hypervigilance except when she's face-to-face with her attacker, she doesn't alter her behavior, and she's ready to jump into bed with a guy only two weeks after the assault. Instead of thinking about the assault or struggling to forget about it, she obsesses over her crush, Lucas, and her breakup with her ex boyfriend. Even her emotions directly after the assault don't ring true. She worries that it was her fault but there are no accompanied feelings of misplaced shame or strong feelings of regret about her behavior. When Buck sexually assaults her a second time she doesn't even think about reporting him or show any more concern for her safety (with the exception of avoiding the stairwell where the second attack took place). She even willingly goes to a party where she knows Buck is going to be, and when he threatens her, she doesn't leave the party. Instead, she proceeds to drink more, putting herself in a more vulnerable position. At one point she admits that the reason she didn't report him in the first place was that she thought that Lucas beating Buck up would prevent him from assaulting anyone again, a ludicrous assumption made even more ludicrous when he continues to threaten her and tries to rape her a second time. Her thoughts are so unbelievably irrational that I couldn't connect with her character. The other characters also lacked any sort of dimensionality. Lucas, the love interest, is your classic brooding bad boy with a tragic past. He even has tattoos, a lip piercing, and drives a motorcycle. Beautiful women throw themselves at him constantly and crowds part for him like the red sea. Women can't help pointing out how hot he is whenever his name is mentioned, even at inappropriate moments like during a discussion about rape. Following the fold of YA novels, he has never had a serious relationship before, though he's hooked up with quite a few women, and he becomes obsessed with Jacqueline before even having a single conversation with her. He even fantasizes about \"taking her away\" (his words, not mine) from her ex boyfriend and creepily stares at her in class all without talking to her once. The side characters don't fair much better. Jacqueline's roommate, Erin, never steps out of the supportive best friend role. Her chief purpose in the novel is to be Jacqueline's friend and encourage her relationship with Lucas. Aside from one other girl, the rest of the females are jealous, catty shrews who glare and smirk at Jacqueline every time Lucas talks to her. Buck is too stupid to live and unbelievable in his actions and motivation. He was downright cartoonish in his villainy. And then there's Benji, the token gay friend whose friendship with Jacqueline springs out of nowhere. They have two lighthearted conversations and suddenly he's confessing that he's coming out to his father over Thanksgiving weekend. The setting also seemed unrealistic, partly because Webber gives almost no locational information. The university is never given a name, and the city and state where the university is located are never mentioned, only that it's in the South, which is a very large and diverse region. The reader is also given little information about the characteristics of the university. There's no indication of the university's prestige, the size of the university, the size of the town where the university is located, the size of the campus, or the make up of the student body in terms of diversity, socioeconomic factors, etc. It's these sorts of details that make a setting come alive and they were sorely missed. I also couldn't identify with Jacqueline's college experience because her university didn't sound anything like any I've ever heard of. She goes to a university where engineering majors are required to take economics, where professors assign seating in large lectures with two hundred students, where professors accept bad break ups as an excuse for missing a midterm, where a single professor can pull strings to a get a failing student into the school, where music majors take algebra. There may be colleges where any of these things happen, but they're not typical, and taken together it was just hard to believe Jacqueline's college was real. There was a distinctly high school vibe about the school experience. Pacing was also an issue. There were far too many unnecessary scenes, which did nothing to move the plot forward and the plot felt very disjointed. Plot points were brought up or alluded to but never fully explored, explained, or resolved begging the question of why they were included in the first place. Different plot points would be dropped at awkward times and forgotten about instead of being present throughout. Lastly, the writing was very unpolished. There were a lot of awkwardly worded sentences, and a few punctuational and grammatical errors. I also thought many of the chapter breaks were oddly placed and some of the scene transitions were hard to follow, particularly those leading up to the emails. Also distracting was Webber's tendency to recap action that happened during a time jump between scenes. While the dialogue wasn't terrible, there were quite a few instance where the characters would over explain things. At one point, a character speaks for four Nook pages straight with only a one sentence break. The novel was definitely in need of professional editing. I would not recommend this book to anyone, although clearly it was enjoyed by many. There are far better books out there that portray the effects of sexual assault and trauma in a more realistic fashion. ...more Wonderful! Amazing <3 I'm sorry everyone, but this review will be full of gushing and little hearts and me being all crazy about a book I absolutely loved So, there are like a million reviews for this one, and I don't really feel like writing an extensive one, because honestly, YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK BEFORE YOU START IT!!!! That's how it was for me, I went into this totally blind, I had absolutely no idea what the book was about, I think I read the blurb but it still gave me Wonderful! Amazing <3 I'm sorry everyone, but this review will be full of gushing and little hearts and me being all crazy about a book I absolutely loved So, there are like a million reviews for this one, and I don't really feel like writing an extensive one, because honestly, YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK BEFORE YOU START IT!!!! That's how it was for me, I went into this totally blind, I had absolutely no idea what the book was about, I think I read the blurb but it still gave me nothing. And I am so glad for that! Everything was a surprise and I loved it from page ONE, which was a surprise because this was my first NA book, and I didn't think I'd even LIKE it, let alone LOVE! Anyway, I'll try to go through the most important things in the book. Prepare for a gush-fest!!!!! 1. First scene in the book Lucas saves Jacqueline from an attempted rape, and that was insta-love for me <3 He was all heroic and sweet and just awesome <3 2. The classes they take together She sees him in class all the time and there are stolen glances everywhere and he keeps sketching things. Yes I know the stolen glances are so high-school, but they were sweet and they made me smile until my cheeks hurt like crazy :D 3. The dance in the disco That was swoony and hot and I think I totally fell in love with Lucas there! Such an awesome scene, I'd kill to see it in his POV!!!!! 4. Something you need to know about Lucas There isn't one thing about him that I don't like. I know he's written that way, and sometimes it bothers me when the have no flaws, but here it just didn't! Anyway, he bites his lip a lot and rakes his fingers through his hair and has this half-smile going on all the time. For those of you who get irritated with those things, you'll probably be so here, but me, NOPE!! I loved it all, even with the lip biting and hands through hair and that half-smile that rarely went into a full one. He has a lip piercing and is tattooed over his arms and has a bike and he draws/sketches/paints, and teaches self-defense class and is just UBER!!!!! 5. Something you need to know about Jacqueline She really DIDN'T go on my nerves! At all! It is pretty unbelievable because she's so young and well, I am not a fan of reading about young people in books, but there you go. No getting on nerves from her. So that's another reason I love this book! She does cry a few times, that I wish she didn't, but oh well, if I was 20-ish and went through attempt of rape and several other things, I'd be a mess as well. Anyway, she just broke up with her boyfriend with whom she'd been for three years, so she's a mess there too. She starts noticing and avoiding Lucas at the same time LOL 6. The sketching I loved every single scene that involved him sketching her, especially the first one!!! OMG it was amazing and wonderful <3 7. Her ex and the bad guy Her ex is a total jerk and I want to hit him in the balls like they did in the defense class. The bad guy is a total jerk and I want to rip off his balls like they did in defense class. 8. Lucas and Jacqueline are so wonderful together <3 I loved every single scene between them. Every. Single. Scene! 9. There is something sad in Lucas's past Gosh I felt so bad for him :((( I thought it was one thing, but it turned out something completely different and even more terrible!!! I want to hug him like crazy!!! 10. The ending is great and amazing and wonderful and all sorts of mushy things I can think of! Well, I don't think I need to say more about it :D Oh yes, it made me cry <3 And so, end of gush-fest :DDD I completely and totally loved this book (shocker, right????) Considering I am NOT a fan of either YA or NA, I am surprised I loved it so much, but I am also glad because this book made it to my best books ever!

If you have been a victim of acquaintance rape or been sexually harassed/assaulted by someone you were familiar with and this book helped you heal in any way whatsoever or you could relate to Jackie's actions, then those are your personal feelings. And it is perfectly okay to have your own opinion. But since this is my review, I take the liberty to judge the subject matter at hand from any and every angle I wish to. And my problem lies with Jackie's unrealistic reactions to certain events, behavior and her acute sense of low self-worth. Such heroines in any kind of literature do not help to boost the morale of our kind, especially the ones who fall victim to sexual violence or violence of any sort. Hope that clears up why I hated this book. Now begins my former review. Caution:- Read at the expense of having to respect someone else's views. --------- Reasons why you shouldn't read this book or why if you do, you might get an overpowering urge to bang your head against the wall every 2 minutes while you're doing so:- [ Spoilers ahead but I'm not bothering to use the spoiler tags since unsuspecting readers should read this and stay the hell away from this book. ] i) The female protagonist is a shining beacon of stupidity and lack of common sense. She is conspicuously lacking in self-respect and a sense of self preservation. She is nearly raped in the parking lot while returning from a frat party one night by a drunken bastard. But does NOT report that to the police in fear of the party getting busted. And her peers blaming her for it. Goodbye logic. ii) Said female has second encounter with the piece of shit where he again tries to rape her, but she still does not have brains enough to get off her ass, walk to the police station and report the matter. Because apparently in this author's world either there's no law enforcement agency or the heroine isn't intelligent enough to figure out the use of one. Instead she enrolls herself in self-defense classes. That's pretty good and all. BUT JUST GO TO THE POLICE STATION ALREADY. iii) She basically lets a potential rapist walk all around campus with his head held high without doing anything about it except snivelling to herself. She does not even tell her room mate what happened. Instead of doing the obvious she is busy pining for a random hot stranger with tattoos and piercings all over his body and makes out with him without even knowing him properly. Apparently when it's him she forgets all about her attacker and the trauma of the assault. And adding to the preposterousness of it all, this random hot stranger is not only her economics class mate but also her econ tutor(who is supposed to be an upperclassman) with whom she exchanges flirtatious mails but does not know they are one and the same person. Uh what? He is an economics genius, looks like a badass with a motorcycle, works at Starbucks, can beat the shit out of creeps and play the knight in shining armor to this brainless bimbo in distress. I have never never come across anything so disgustingly cliche-ridden. It is at this point that I gave up hope for this book. It seems that 'rationale' is not the author's favorite word. And I cannot believe that it has been nominated for Best YA novel of the year and Best Goodreads author. Had it been possible to give it a 0 star I wouldn't have hesitated at all. I wonder if the person who tagged this as 'realistic fiction' was being sarcastic. P.S.:- Dear ladies who found this a really 'inspirational' story, please don't be foolish enough to let all the sexist 18th century crap get to you. There will never be a random, sexy stranger who comes out of nowhere to rescue you from danger. Use your brain and GO TO THE POLICE. Never give your tormentor a second chance to attack you. And keep a pepper spray bottle or a taser in your bag. ...more Huge 5 stars I really loved this story but not for the reasons I expected. What I expected was an angst filled, all consuming, volatile romance between the hero and heroine. What the author gave me, however, was far from that and much better.

I highly recommend this wonderful story. ...more So somebody told me this book was like Beautiful Disaster but not completely horrible, woman hating and nonsensical. I snorted, thanked them for the rec and went on my merry way. So let me express this in the most calm and reasonable way I can. Easy by Tamara Webber is fantastic and wonderful and that person was 100% right. I have to admit, the book and I didn\u2019t get off to a great start. It begins with Jacqueline at college, bummed from getting dumped by her longterm boyfriend, almost getting rape So some\u00adbody told me this book was like Beau\u00adti\u00adful Dis\u00adas\u00adter but not com\u00adpletely hor\u00adri\u00adble, woman hat\u00ading and non\u00adsen\u00adsi\u00adcal. I snorted, thanked them for the rec and went on my merry way. So let me express this in the most calm and rea\u00adson\u00adable way I can. Easy by Tamara Web\u00adber is fan\u00adtas\u00adtic and won\u00adder\u00adful and that per\u00adson was 100% right. I have to admit, the book and I didn\u2019t get off to a great start. It begins with Jacque\u00adline at col\u00adlege, bummed from get\u00adting dumped by her longterm boyfriend, almost get\u00adting raped before Lucas res\u00adcues her. So, for some\u00adone who is adamantly against rape being used and glossed over just to fur\u00adther a plot or have the hero seem heroic, I was decid\u00adedly unimpressed. But it soon becomes clear that Web\u00adber has taken the topic of rape extremely seri\u00adously. In fact, by the end of the novel I was cheer\u00ading and punch\u00ading the air because this book was the best I\u2019ve ever read an author han\u00addle the sub\u00adject for con\u00adtem\u00adpo\u00adrary readers. Nor\u00admally, in books where the female MC is almost raped and saved by the hero, the rapist gets beaten up and left behind and the hero\u00adine goes on her merry way. And some\u00adtimes the rapist harasses her and the author cov\u00aders the trauma for the hero\u00adine until the rapist is killed by the hero in the final bat\u00adtle and those two get to run off into the sunset. What a freakin\u2019 relief that Web\u00adber takes it really damn seri\u00adously \u2013 even though the begin\u00adning of the novel would lead you to believe that she wouldn\u2019t. There was a point near the end of the novel where Jacque\u00adline has to talk to a bunch of soror\u00adity girls about rape and I wanted to cry and cheer and do a lit\u00adtle girl power dance. So I loved Jacque\u00adline, I loved Lucas, I loved most of this book. I thought it was well writ\u00adten and rea\u00adson\u00adably well-paced and you know what? Seemed like it was actu\u00adally writ\u00adten about col\u00adlege kids who actu\u00adally do col\u00adlege things. I\u2019m really glad I picked this one up. It was, indeed, a really fun, lovely read that I highly endorse. Also, Jacqueline\u2019s slap down on Kennedy was epic \u2013 right to the end. She kicked seri\u00adous butt. ...more *4.5* This book has made me really want to take a self defence class. Dear lord. 4.5! Wow, really enjoyed it.

Lucas Easy was such an emotionally deep story, realistic in nature, and had a wonderful steamy romance between a tortured hero who is obsessed/possessive over Jacqueline, and a heroine who must now come to terms with the choices she made. Lucas was AWESOME. A hot tortured guy who was obsessed and possessive of Jacqueline, but in a way that never crosses the line. He defends and protects her from a violent sexual rapist on campus, and gives her reason to believe that her decision to attend the college that her now ex-boyfriend chose might not have been a bad decision after all. If you like a hero with some tats, a small lip piercing, and rides a motorcycle, you'll love Lucas. After the altercation,Jacqueline finds herself drawn to Lucas. He is a student in her economics class, and oddly one of a few she truly trusts. Because she is so drawn to him, she lets her girlfriends convince her to play hard to get with him in hopes he could be a rebound man from her ex-boyfriend. Too bad he didn't take class very serious, he spends his time sketching images instead of listening and taking notes. Jacqueline She soon finds herself a bit torn between Lucas and her online tutor Landon. Landon and her have never met, but he is smart, motivated and interesting. They exchange a ton of emails, and he becomes an invaluable resource and help so she doesn't flunk out of economics. Campus Party Life The author did a great job portraying the reality of college life. Partying, studying, flirting as well as the risks and how to protect oneself. As much as I didn't agree with Jacqueline's decision early in the story, I do realize (sadly) how common that is. The story has quite a few twists and kept me fully engaged all the way through. While the subject matter is rather dark at times, it never gets bogged down with the drama. The main focus remains on Jacqueline and her building attraction and relationship with Lucas. The romance story was the best part, and it never goes overboard on angst and self inflicted drama, as BD was notorious for. In a nutshell, this story really is about Jacqueline's journey after making her rash decision to follow her boyfriend(now ex) to his college. Wonderful things happen for her too, including meeting some great friends and the oh-so-hot Lucas. She was a very likable character, smart and deserving of good things. Her chemistry with Lucas felt real. I rarely read YA, but this one is actually considered more adult in nature, and I agree. Think of this as a blend of YA with more adult material and some steamy sexual scenes mixed with some fade-to-black moments. The make out scenes get super steamy hot, but when it is more than that it will fade to black. The relationship is right for their age and maturity, too. I am so glad I took the chance on this one, I highly recommend it. ...more .. So easy to like, so easy to get lost into the story, so easy to get to the last page and wish for more... 4.5 stars.

It's hard to think of the reasons why i liked it so much, and I'm not even sure if it matters because usually what i like about a book is not what others might like - some books just work while others don't and I am always happy when i get to enjoy what I read. This being said, I am not sure if these are my\u00a0reasons\u00a0to love it, but I am pretty sure that you will enjoy them all: Jacqueline is my kind of character. I liked her voice (smart and funny), her strong personality - after what almost happend to her in the beginning of the book she still could pretend that her life was (almost) the way it used to; she still managed to keep her head up and confront whatever it was to confront. Yes, she needed a bit of time to recover, but that only makes her human and that only makes me like her more. If I had to describe her in a few words I would say that she was really stubborn and she almost always knew what she wanted (and how to get it). Even though she still had some feelings for her ex she wouldn't have left him back in after that embarrassing break-up (that's the spirit!). She also has a great best friend (Erin), a bit crazy but lovely nevertheless, and this made me happy because I love to read about good friends that can be there for each other. There was a lot of humor involved and that was also great because some topics were pretty hard to digest and my heart needed a few happy moments here and there. Lucas - He is so sexy and mysterious and I loved how he seemed to play the same game Jacqueline was playing (that her friends made her play). I liked that he was spontaneous and at times not as predictable as Jacqueline wanted him to be. Not to mention that he is very talented at drawing - and I find this even more sexy than his dark, bad-boy -ish look. (view spoiler) [His secret broke my heart, I could imagine his younger self suffering so much and not being able to change a thing, to help. It still gives me goose bumps, I didn't expect it to be so horrifying, but it was and I wanted to keep him safe, to hold him in my arms forever and make him forget all the bad things in his life. I guess I am saying a bit too much, but I can't help it. He is the main reason I loved this book and he deserves every single thought I have about him. (hide spoiler) ] Landon - Oh my, I want to go back to school. I need a tutor to flirt via email and I think that this smart guy might be just perfect for the job. I loved the e-mails between the 2 of them - they were so fun and flirty and cute.. and I found myself smiling more often than I thought I would. \u201cLove is not the absence of logic but logic examined and recalculated heated and curved to fit inside the contours of the heart\u201d This story comes in a very big package - there is a lot of humor, there is some (hot) romance, but there are also some though subjects (view spoiler) [like rape and death (hide spoiler) ] . There is the need to move on, there is the need to forget, there is the need to start over, and what makes this story special is the fact that all these things fit so perfectly together. You are not overwhelmed by them, but you can understand them, feel them. There was one tiny thing I didn't particularly enjoy: Buck -\u00a0It's not only because he is the 'evil' character in the story, but because his personality was a bit inconsistent - he was there at the beginning, just a bit by the middle and then a bit near the ending. But between these moments he was mostly absent. I couldn't fear him, he didn't seem to be a threat... and oh, I wanted to kick his ass so damn badly! Also I don't understand why didn't Lucas just called the police in the beginning (I understood why he didn't kill the bastard, even though in his state of mind he was pretty close to do it and I can't even judge him for that)... Still, without this fact we wouldn't have had a story to read, so I'll just let this go. But I didn't like him, just so you know. I guess this is it; these days I am not too good at expressing my feelings for the books I like, but \"Easy\" is really good and easy to love, so I am sure that you will like it. Pick it up, read it, love it, and come back to talk more about it ;) Happy midnight reading! ** This review can also be found at ReadingAfterMidnight.com ____________________________________________ Blog (EN) | Facebook | Twitter | Tumblr | Bloglovin' | Blog (RO) ____________________________________________ [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more I loved Tammara's Between the Lines series. I've read all three books in the series more than once. So, when I found out she was writing a book with college aged characters, I was thrilled. Easy did not let me down. From the moment I began reading it I couldn't walk away from it. I cried, I laughed, I yelled and I cheered. It's an emotional journey that I wasn't expecting. I suggest you READ IT. This is one that will keep you up reading all night long. I am so stinking in love with this book! It had everything I love\u2014romance, heartache, friendship, a mysterious, compelling, sexy as hell leading man (I may be completely head over heels in love with Lucas now. No, I definitely am.) It also touched on a very serious subject in a realistic way that drew you into the minds and hearts of the characters. I could see myself reacting in the same way, having the exact same thoughts. It really spoke to me, and Tammara\u2019s notes on the end\u2026I\u2019ll be honest, I I am so stinking in love with this book!

Incredible story from an incredible author, and even though I just finished it, and my to-read list is a mile long, I\u2019m going to read it again. This book just moved right to the top of my all-time favorite books list. I can\u2019t recommend it enough. ...more For more reviews please visit BLOG https://bookmonstersblog.com/ According to me a Prologue or the 1st Chapter of a book is THE reflection!

EASY deals with rape and assault, and there's the painful, serious quality to those parts of the book! Background It's set at a university! The main character, Jaqueline, a cool girl, artsy musician--smart student she has gone to this university to be with her boyfriend! Type of Characters and my choices according to pictures : Lucas OH MAN LUCAS - LUCAS - LUCAS \u2192 is one of the most intriguing leading characters, a perfect wounded hero. Jaqueline, a cool girl, artsy musician Relationship development As Jacqueline starts off pushing her life forward after her heartbreak and also after the end of a 3 year relationship the story unfolds and there is not one pause in this book! \u2192 I WAS LIKE JUST ONE MORE PAGE BABE - and hubby is NOOO - shut of the lights NOW grr - what about my readers feelings NOT NICE. Adam Lambert - Another Lonely Night https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT_xn... Two conflicting BUT equally desirable guys come into her life. We meet Lucas, the mysterious artist in her class and a totally swoon worthy male. Then there's Landon, the class instructor who is bright and humorous and seems to be what Jacqueline needs right now after her breakup Lucas character I could not or could would resist I just wanted more and more of him *wink* (I AM HIDING HIM UNDER MY BED IN CASE YOUR WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM) His heartache surrounding his backstory vibrates even after you finish the book. I felt like I really got to know him, like I would know what to say to him in conversation if I met him \u2192 As you noted I loved Lucas (WHO AM I KIDDING - I AM TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH MY NEW BB - hook and center) Jacqueline is a strong reliable character. When the book starts she is very unsure of herself, she gains strength as the book progresses and it unfolds so beautifully. She needs to learn to accept how to cope with the after effects from her attack and rape, but there's also the subtle changes she undergoes via her relationship with Lucas and he is such a sweetheart throughout this ordeal and her healing process! The secondary characters, especially Erin, Jacqueline's roommate, is different than Jacqueline, and it's really important to the story she is unique and adds an edge to the story-line Chapter Development The chemistry between Jacqueline and Lucas is ridiculously hot. Easy doesn't have a ton of blatant sex, but it has some of the most sensual reading scenes I've read. Quote \u2192 I loved Everyone needs a best friend like Erin. She's the perfect balance of zany & voice of reason. \"Could be hot...\" she whispered. \"Especially if there's a uniform. Or handcuffs.\" (I TOTALLY AGREE WITH HER BTW) Epilogue! \u2192 Bottom line: I was totally miserable when I came to the final page, not sure when I pick up next read I will like it but hopefully I will not go into a book slump after this read! Recommend to the following type of readers: \u2192 Over 16 etc Will I recommend this Will I read it again?\u2192 YES AND I WILL Highly RECOMMEND IT! My feelings while reading this: \u2192 To the Author <---A>Tammara Webber</---A> created an astonishing extraordinary BOOK THIS AUTHOR She has written a book that will be hard-to-get-out-of-my-head story-line, she written with skill craft an just an amazing story! Thank you TW\u2013 You ROCK ...more Love is not the absence of logic but logic examined and recalculated - heated and curved to fit inside the contours of the heart This might be my favorite book of Webber's to date. There's something about the stories she writes which makes me throw out my preset ideas of what I wouldn't like in a book. She rearranges my reservations and makes me want to know more about her flawed characters. \"When I registered for econ, I had no idea that I'd be in for this level of reality-show drama. It's Love is not the absence of logic but logic examined and recalculated - heated and curved to fit inside the contours of the heart This might be my favorite book of Webber's to date. There's something about the stories she writes which makes me throw out my preset ideas of what I wouldn't like in a book. She rearranges my reservations and makes me want to know more about her flawed characters. \"When I registered for econ, I had no idea that I'd be in for this level of reality-show drama. It's like a big fat bonus.\" My love affair with drama books turned cold when drama started to morph from 'truly shocking' to 'nothing but drama for the sake of shock value.' I've been wary to even go near books which might end up invoking my wrath by trying to force me into fraudulent emotions. Even though there were a few 'tried and true' plot points that are guaranteed to bring out the screaming fangirls, I didn't feel bamboozled (you just can't stop my love for weird words) into going along for the ride. So what does this make me? Have I turned into the OMG YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!!! eleven!11one!1!!!11agghhhh!!! type of fan? Hmm..maybe not exactly. But I'm not going to hide my admiration for a love story that did just so happen to make me feel a little bit warm and fuzzy inside. It was a sweet read. I would have fallen for Lucas myself if I was Jackie. How could you not? \"What's wrong?\" His hands gripped my elbows as I stared up at him. He was wearing drawstring pajama bottoms and a dark t-shirt, the sexy lines of his tattoos spilling from his sleeves to his wrists. He also wore thin, black-framed glasses that accentuated the blue in his eyes and his dark lashes. Lucas was kind, protective, smart, artsy, and caring. Yes, he was the entire package. Maybe a bit too much at times. He could kick your assailant's ass, work several jobs, draw an incredible life rendering of you, cook you a fabulous dinner, and help you get your econ grade up, all before making your head swim at his lovin' skills. I had a few flashbacks of the hero from Extreme Exposure . I'm hardly complaining though. Lucas was the hotness, even if he was too good to be true. Mild spoilers ahead but they really only tie to things you'll end up finding out pretty early on in the book, so I'd say it's okay to read them anyway. Here's what I liked : The email exchanges. They were fun. The friendship banter. It was realistic. I know some people might be upset at one girl calling another a slut, or seeing two girls scheme how to catch a guy by acting 'interested, yet still indifferent' (yes that is a contradiction, but I understood it)...but this is how I would have acted with my friends when I was younger, so it was cute to me. If you're friends with me long enough, at some point you will be called a hooker. It is my term of endearment. The emphasis on how rape is serious and needs to be reported so other people aren't hurt in the future. The suggestion of therapy to a character who wasn't healed from a past hurt. Not all hurts go away. Long-term effects can haunt people their entire lives. I want to see serious issues being taken seriously, so this was something I appreciated. Here's what I didn't like : Secrets took too long to be revealed. Lucas probably could have taken a more proactive role in getting Jackie into self defense classes or even talking to someone about what had happened. Should you read this book? If you'd like to read about a sweet and intense love story that just might make you feel a little giddy inside, I'd say definitely check this one out. I was shocked, and a little embarrassed, but once glance at his face told me he savored my body's response, and his ability to trigger it. ...more Okay, this was such a great book. Sweet but not cheesy or immature... mature but not too adult... the perfect cross-over book. I'll definitely be looking for more by this very talented author! I might write more of a review if I can think of some way to do this story justice. For now, this must suffice. 5 HUGE STARS!!

However, I will say that this is a book about choices, the nasty and the sweet side of life, empowerment, and friendship. Jacqueline and Lucas are brought together for a reason\u2026to save each other. When you know its right, grab on, hold on, reach out, be patient\u2026\u201cgood things come to those who wait\u201d. Tammara Webber did a wonderful job depicting the college setting, and unfortunately, what can also be the sad reality of campus life. Just beware, there is delicate subject matter addressed in this book, and the picture painted isn\u2019t always pretty, this is more than just a light YA romance. As for Lucas, he was once a bad-boy, still had the bad boy \u201cimage\u201d, was fierce and protective when need be, but he was also a sweet gentle soul *sigh*! He is the stuff YA romance novels are made of, every girl\u2019s dream. Jacqueline was a little na\u00efve, but with some nudging from her awesome, brazen, loyal roommate and friend Erin, she empowered herself with the knowledge and skills that allowed her to take a stand. Yes!!! The story is well-written, compact, but complete. Initially I didn\u2019t think that the length of the book would allow the story to develop properly, but it did and the epilogue finished it off nicely. It left me very satisfied. This is the fourth book that I\u2019ve read from Tammara Webber and I look forward to seeing what this gifted author has in store for us. I highly recommend this read and the other books she has to offer. \u201cChoosing to be with you isn\u2019t a difficult decision, Jacqueline,\u201d he breathed, pulling back one final time to stare into my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s easy. Incredibly easy.\u201d LUCAS -Unusually clear gray-blue eyes, messy hair, wayward bangs, and a ghost of a smile ...more Wow, what a huge surprise this was! Unexpected layers, a heroine who develops over the course of the book, and a seriously, seriously crush-worthy guy. Love is not the absence of logic, but logic examined and recalculated heated and curved to fit inside the contours of the heart AHHHHH *squeals into pillow* I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!! It was so easy to devour, get lost, and fall in love with every single word on that page. And Lucas.... *swoons* This is about a college girl named Jacqueline (internally cheers because OMG ITS MY NAME IN A BOOK) who just had her boyfriend of three years break up with her and decides to go to a Halloween party with he Love is not the absence of logic, but logic examined and recalculated heated and curved to fit inside the contours of the heart AHHHHH *squeals into pillow* I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!

And Lucas.... *swoons* This is about a college girl named Jacqueline (internally cheers because OMG ITS MY NAME IN A BOOK) who just had her boyfriend of three years break up with her and decides to go to a Halloween party with her friends. As she's leaving the party, she gets attacked and then rescued by Lucas *fans self* They begin to grow closer...and that's all I'm going to tell you! It's so much more fun just to go in blind and read it! \"The night we met- I'm not like that guy.\" His jaw was rigid. \"I know tha-\" He placed a finger over my lips, his expression softening. \"So I don't want you to feel pressured. Or overpowered. But I do, absolutely want to kiss you right now. Badly.\" I loved, loved the romance of the college setting! How he would sit in the back and sketch her, and how she would try not to look over her shoulder at him. So sweet! He was like in love with her before he met her and ahhhh it was adorable! As for being somewhere you're not supposed to be--Maybe you're here for a reason, or there is no reason. Jacqueline was so strong! I loved how she didn't let what happened to her get in the way of her overall happiness and how she slowly started to tell people about it. Obviously she should have gone to the police right away but in that moment, in the state of shock, she was so scared that I felt for her so deeply. I loved the way that serious issue was talked about in this book. It was raw and real and horrifying but handled perfectly. And I loved when she told Erin and the two of them started taking self-defense classes! I really enjoyed those interactions and this whole story makes you want to take self-defense classes and be just as strong as Jacqueline! Apologies could come too late. And in the midst of dealing with the post trauma from that night, she is also dealing with the repercussions of a break up from her boyfriend of 3 years! Time would not change what I was feeling-or not feeling. I'd had time and though the ache from his desertion hadn't disappeared, it was decreasing. My future was blurry, yes, but I was beginning to imagine a future when I would no longer miss him at all. There was definitely a sense of empowerment from this book, both from Lucas and Jacqueline. It's clear that Lucas is also trying to overcome a heart breaking past and I loved seeing them be there for one another and come together... As he leaned over me, I felt heightened awareness of every part of my body that touched a part of his--the edge of his hip pressed to mine, his chest sliding against mine, his fingers tracing from wrists to forearms and then framing my face. He held me in place, lips near my ear. When he kissed the sensitive spot, my breath shuddered. \"You're so beautiful,\" he whispered, moving his mouth to mine. *clutches heart* THE ROMANCE. LUCAS! He's so mysterious, so hot, and so fantastic to read! Ahh I fell completely in love with him! He's sweet, sexy, and smart. What more could a girl want? I loved how he was so protective over Jacqueline and yes there was some back and forth but then you get to end and all of it just clicks and then your heart breaks all over again. He brushed my tears from my face. \"How did I find you?\" Overall, this book was highly addicting, emotional, beautiful, heart pounding and so wonderful to read. The writing was fantastic, the characters were real, and it was such a joy to read. I can't recommend this book enough. All I feel when I want to talk about is just GUSH and squeals because ahhhhh LUCAS AND JACQUELINE! I loved every single aspect of this book and highly recommend! Especially if you're looking to get into New Adult, this is a good one to start with! So much love!! \"Choosing to be with you isn't a difficult decision Jacqueline,\" He breathed, pulling back one more time to stare into my eyes. \"It's easy. Incredibly easy.\" ...more Le sigh.... I wanted to love this book. I really did. But the characters frustrated me to no end. I did however, love Lucas and Jacqueline - the parts of the book where they were actually interacting were by far the highlights of the story for me. The hero and heroine just did not make what I'd call smart relationship decisions. I was really rooting for them and they WERE utterly adorable together, but they just didn't seem to be very functional for a vast majority of the book. I felt like they ke Le sigh....

I felt like they kept making the wrong calls - not choosing the smart, functional path. I really just wanted yell at them... No, don't ignore her. No, don't play games with him. No, don't go to your ex's house. No, don't lie to her. No, the solution is not that 'we can't be together'. No, don't be passive when you know he's hiding something, call him on it. And just tell each other how you feel!!!! They spent so much of the book ignoring each other! Gah! They'd interact, then go days without speaking, then interact again, go back to ignoring, or deciding things wouldn't work out, then talk again, then ignore more... sigh. It got frustrating. There was a lot of stupidy. A lot of 'hot-cold'. Kinda made me want to bang my head against a wall and then just lock them both in a room together until they communicated more. I basically felt it would have been very easy to have avoided most of the problems and angst of this book by simple communication. This being said, I didn't dislike the book at all, there were definitely good parts to it and it did keep my attention. I really did love Lucas - what a gorgeous tortured character! I was totally swooning over him! As the best friend said, \"Holy fuckburgers. Who was that hot guy?\" lol. He was so respectful, so protective, and quite the gentleman while still being a total kick ass, tattooed and pierced bad boy college hottie. Jacqueline though... I was kind of on the fence about her. I didn't like how she played games with Lucas in the beginning, or would ignore him for days on end (SO frustrating!). But she wasn't a bad heroine, I just didn't really connect with her or agree with her decisions always. And I absolutely loved Lucas and Jacqueline together - when they weren't ignoring each other, they were a seriously CUTE couple!! They had great dialogue, swoony interactions and some very steamy moments! And let me tell you, Ms Weber can write one helluva hot kiss! Seriously! \"I pressed against him and he groaned into my mouth and wrenched his mouth from mine, breathing raggedly. \"I have to go now, or I'm not going.\" Honestly though, if it wasn't for how much I liked the parts where Lucas and Jacqueline were actually together, I might have put the book down. I felt I was reading only to get to those parts. Here's how I see Lucas and Jacqueline: ...more 4.5 sweet stars.

This wasn\u2019t an angst filled tale of woe and young love. Yes, there were some sad parts, some happy parts, some sweet parts\u2026 overall, a great read. \u201cWe talked--recent history only--and Lucas relayed the story of how Francis came to be his roommate. \"He showed up at the door one night, demanding to be let in. Napped on the sofa for an hour, then demanded to be let out. It turned into a nightly ritual, with him staying longer and longer, until at some point I realized he'd moved in.

Like everything else I've broken down and read lately, this was one I'd been avoiding for a long time. I kept hearing the word rape when someone mentioned this, and it sort of put me off.

When her attacker turns stalker, Jacqueline has a choice: crumple in defeat or learn to fight back. Lucas remains protective, but he's hiding secrets of his own. So, I'm thinking that maybe Lucas played a part in her getting attacked or something! Ewwww! Nooooo! I don't wanna read a romance with THIS dude as the love interest! I'm mentioning this, because if you're weird like me, then I want to put your mind at ease. Lucas' secret isn't that he's sneaking into her laundry basket to sniff her panties, or hiring guys to attack her so he can play hero. Sure, his dark past haunts their relationship at some point, but it's nothing he did. Which means, he's not a creeper, he's just a bit damaged . Anyhoo, if you're fond of the fixer-uper (read: Tragic Hero), then you will most likely loooove Lucas, because usually my crusty heart isn't swayed by these types of guys, and even I (grudgingly) found him somewhat adorable. So. Yeah. Short, sweet, and it tackles some dark subject matter without getting too heavy. It also made me realize that I need to make sure my girls have taken a good self defense class before they head off to college, and I need have a few more talks with my boys about stepping in and putting a stop to any hinky behavior from other guys.

He brushed my tears from my face. \u201cHow did I find you?\u201d I must admit that guys with lip piercing and tattoos are not very high in my book boyfriends list,but Lucas is one of the few exceptions.I looked beneath his appearance and saw a young man struggling to survive and I wanted desperately to hug and comfort him.The romance was all-consuming and devastating ,it was such a unique exprerience to watch the heroes getting over their issues and falling in love.My heart kept pounding in my chest and I could not help but think that if every girl met a boy like Lucas and every boy a girl like Jacqueline,relationships would be wholly different.Nothing was perfect,there were lies and broken trust involved,but in the end it all comes to the ability and the will to let someone who has the ability to hurt you become a part of you. Tammara Webber painted vividly some very realistic characters and proved that she is a talented author.Besides the wonderful romance ,she passed some very powerful messages about rape .I get nauseous every time this terrible act is mentioned,and Tammara showed the ugly face of it and the consequences,as well as the way it affects a person's social status and the tendency to blame the victims and wrap things up.I was really upset when Jacqueline refused to report the attack on her,but I felt very proud of her when she decided to take some action. \u201cThe way he kissed me felt like a brand.Like he was tattooing himself under my skin.\u201d The way Easy is tattooed on my soul .This is not a book that I will ever be able to forget. ...more *5 PERFECT STARS* So, I started reading this around 10PM...

This book was truly impossible to put down! \u201cLove is not the absence of logic but logic examined and recalculated heated and curved to fit inside the contours of the heart\u201d This easily became one of my favorite romance novels ever! Though the story wasn't anything particularly original or ground-breaking, the way it was told and how relatable it was really moved me. I was growing a little tired of dystopian/young adult books these days so I decided to read some romance/new adult again and boy, this was the perfect book to start with! Since reading this, I'm more obsessed with romance than ever! This story is about Jacqueline who just broke up with her longtime boyfriend Kennedy, whom she gave up everything for. A few weeks later, at a party, one of Kennedy's friends tries to rape her, but a boy she's never seen before, Lucas, was there just in time to save her. She discovers he's in one of her classes and she decides that he'd be the perfect rebound for Kennedy. But after she gets to know him better, sparks start flyingggg, and oh my , Jacqueline and Lucas are just perffffffect for eachother! I'm completely obsessed with their relationship and their chemistry is off the charts! There was some form of a love triangle in this book but the main focus still stayed on Jackie and Lucas and that's part of what I loved about this. There were no doubts about their feelings for one another. It does get kind of interesting when a tutor called Landon Maxfield makes an entrance ;) The characters were all just awesome! Jacqueline is an awesome leading lady, she's just someone you can really connect with, and Lucas is the perfect knight in shining armor with a haunting past. Erin is the best friend in the whole world and Buck is the villain everyone loves to hate. Benji and Kennedy were also awesome side characters, just like Chaz. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about any of them. This book deals with a lot of sensitive topics like rape, love, hurt, heartbreak, childhood trauma, stalking and self-defence. There are also some pretty steamy scenes, but who doesn't like that aye? /wink wink/ The whole story was just so well written and could happen to anyone anywhere, it gave me chills! I feel like this book really taught me a lesson on life and that when something big happens, you need to talk to someone about it, and that it's very important that you have people you can trust. This is a book I'm definitely going to re-read someday, and that's not something that happens very often with me. To all those who haven't read this yet: GO DO IT NOWWWW! ...more OMG THIS BOOK. THIS BOOK. WOW. I loved this so much! I sobbed, I laughed out loud, I swooned. This book was everything. A word of warning, this book has depictions of sexual assault and stalking (hence, the sobbing). Tammara Webber did an amazing job with this and I highly recommend it if you want to try the new adult genre!

I'll admit I'm critical because many NA titles have left me burned as a result and I can't say I've had many to speak fondly of considering some of the issues they have and how they've approached them.

It's definitely not the worst I've read in this genre or in general, but I have a lot of words. Full review: Tammara Webber's \"Easy\" is a rather inaccurate, formulaic, and juvenile portrayal of the emotional consequence, debate, and coming to terms in the aftermath of rape/sexual assault in a college environment. I could end the review right on those notes alone, but the unspoken question (aside from whatever projectile objects might be thrown at me for making such a statement) might be why I say this about the novel. It's difficult enough for me to speak against the grain when there have been so many people, in my reading circles, friends, among those who have read this book, who have sang its praises. I don't really feel pressured in reviewing this and speaking my mind, but dangnabit, I have to wonder why not very many people saw the very rampant problems that were in this book that counteracted its respective messages. I think there's something to be said in the individual reading experiences we have and what we are able to see or not see in that measure. I'm totally respectful of that, and I recognize that in other works that I perhaps loved, but others disliked, I may have been more forgiving or seen certain angles of a story very differently. I think that's fine. Unfortunately, for my experience reading \"Easy\", I saw many, many problematic elements here. To be blunt - where was I during the heart-wrenching, tear jerking events, sing its praises purported feminism, and \"OMG squee\" worthy moments of this book? I don't think they ever arrived. I don't think there was a single moment where I saw this as a multidimensional story with multiple stakes, or a coming to terms for ANY of the characters here, especially the heroine. I struggled on the part of caring for the characters because they were so one-dimensional, cookie cutter caricatures lacking the kind of depth and flesh to make them matter as people dealing with real trials and tribulations. More on that a little later in this review. \"Easy\" had some positive messages in spells, which I liked because it's leaps and bounds better than some of the peer books in this category. However, the book features a plethora of problematic elements to counterbalance the positive statements. Where do I begin? I suppose it's worth saying that the first chapter begins with a graphic sexual assault scene. Trigger warning to anyone who picks up this book. I'll admit it hit me hard as I listened to the audiobook version, not just for the graphic nature of it, but the formulaic notation. I know this book was written and published before Erin McCarthy's \"True\", but I have to give \"Easy\" the same criticism: starting a book with a rape or near rape scene as a tie linking the two leads together isn't my idea of romantic. A measure in which someone is either raped or nearly raped is a horrifying experience. Sure there's a trope in literature where the damsel is distress is saved by the hero in a moment of peril. It's a common one, I understand there are some who don't seem to mind it or actually like that trope for preference. But when you hinge a story like this with such a heavy backdrop of rape/SA and how the heroine comes to terms with it, do you really want to play up the romantic angle against the psychological angles, completely shortchanging the latter on behalf of the former? That latter notation is exactly what this book did. I'll admit that was the moment I knew this book could either go in a really bad direction or not really amount to as much as it likely could've done. This story is from the perspective of a college sophomore Jackie (I'll call her this because it's easier, but in the story, she prefers Jacqueline) who has to cope with the aftermath of being nearly raped at a party. She's saved by a stranger (Lucas) who just happens upon her and her would be rapist (Buck). Lucas and Jackie have a tentatively developing relationship following said event, and while Jackie does have reactions of fear in the aftermath of her encounter with Buck, whom she claims she's known for a year, I found it difficult to believe. Her fear is quite threadbare. I won't go so far as saying that a rape victim perhaps wouldn't have felt some of the same things that Jackie goes through (saying that she wouldn't call the police and disrupt the party and blaming herself, even when Lucas tells her she shouldn't), but it's hard to read, because mentally I'm telling myself the right thing to do where she didn't act upon it. Rape victims go through many different motions depending upon their experiences, backgrounds, knowledge, mental assertions among other things. To assume that there's just one reaction to a rape/sexual assault is limiting at best, so I'm glad when an author can explore a character's mindset as to what they think, feel, fear, and bargain in the aftermath. I could probably get behind the author doing that with respect to Jackie for realism considering in the aftermath of a traumatic event, there are people who do think that way. But then, the narrative continues on like she doesn't have any sexual triggers stemming from the event in the aftermath. She flinches when Buck threatens her and she's in his presence, but to assume that it doesn't have an affect with her relationship with Lucas? Not so much. To top it off, I was actually annoyed with the instalove that's woven into Jackie and Lucas's encounter. The characters themselves are set pieces, really. Benji, the gay friend/sidekick who edges Jackie's relationship on and comes out to his parents, but there's not a thing the reader learns about him otherwise (I actually wanted to know him more because I liked his character voice). Erin, the best friend, who thankfully doesn't slut shame or blame Jackie for what happened, and she does drop her boyfriend when he supports Buck on the allegations of rape, but I still found it difficult to delve into her character. She keeps encouraging Jackie to make her relationship work with Lucas, and I felt like I was in the middle of reading a chick-lit novel that emphasized the romance rather than the very complex stakes that the heroine endures. Lucas, the tattooed hero who not only has a contrived conflict with the heroine considering a double identity he has, but also has a past which could've been handled with so much better weight than what the narrative provided. It was supposed to be \"shocking\", but the way the heroine discovers the truth is so...so darned annoying. I hated Jackie's jealous streaks and how that pertained to Lucas, and I hated that she didn't trust him enough And it felt like a way to milk the conflict rather than an actual coming to terms for Lucas. Buck, who I honestly have to say that I'm really disappointed in how his character came across as pretty much as nothing more than the \"evil rapist\". Not a lick of realism. It felt like he was either the villain in a Gossip Girl episode or a formulaic Lifetime movie, as if he wanted to leap from the bushes at some point to tackle and torment the heroine. It felt like such a blatant display of conflict that would not necessarily happen in real life. He tries to assault Jackie three times. THREE TIMES. In at least one of those times, Jackie willingly shows up in the same place she knows he's going to be and doesn't feel the least bit anxious about it. It just wasn't shown well, and it felt contrived. And I feel like the morality play here was milked a bit because there's the overt measure that Jackie (alongside Erin, with Lucas being an instructor) learns self defense and just so happens to be able to *use* that self defense when he encounters her for the third time. It's too darned convenient. Don't get me started on the professor/former officer who just so happens to be Lucas and Jackie's instructor. That was also too convenient for the latter conflict of the novel regarding Lucas's past. I also sincerely doubt that a professor in a college would be so forgiving of a student who missed two weeks, including a major midterm, on the front of \"romantic problems.\" Jackie was unceremoniously dumped by her former boyfriend Kennedy in the beginning of the novel. Speaking of Kennedy, I hated him as well, but at least he was intended to be hated on the part of the way he dumps the heroine by making the excuse that he wanted to see other women and that he was dumping her for the sake of preserving his future. Not only that, he totally victim blames a girl who was raped by Buck AND makes the comment that he at first thought Jackie was fabricating her story just because she was upset for breaking up with him. I mentally told him to go screw himself so many times in the course of this novel (to Jackie's credit, so did she). I didn't necessarily think his inclusion as a character was a bad one because it did give many opportunities for the author to knock down these stereotypes, but it still felt like he wasn't more than a set piece in this overarching novel. Then there's one character (Note, just ONE character) who makes an impassioned speech against the \"mean girls\" of the sorority that Erin is a part of (Buck rapes another girl who is a member there. Apparently it was shown that many of the girls totally didn't believe either the girl that was raped or Jackie's near attempt, but this character actually come across in a prime scene to knock down the slut shaming/victim blaming that goes on because of her personal experiences. I thought that was one of the more potent aspects of the novel, but it felt like it wasn't enough for the narrative, nor did her character really have that much scene time to really make it count in the overarching narrative. There are other characters I could name that fall into these cookie cutter roles, but I'm going to double back to Lucas because for a \"bad boy\" hero who saves the heroine and knows she was nearly raped - I have to question some of his particular actions towards the heroine, including touching her as he's trying to sketch her when she's obviously uncomfortable with it, and while he may ask her in certain spells whether she's comfortable doing something, he negates asking her in others. Plus there's one scene where he touches her, but when she goes to touch him, he dismisses it quickly. Argh. He wasn't a swoon-worthy hero to me at all, and he lacked the dimension/definition of his character to really bring me into his experiences and character. Finally, as if these fundamental problems with story and characterization weren't enough, the college environment is pretty inaccurate on a number of levels. No specificity to the school, contradicting information about the classes the characters attend, and just a general lack of immersion in the environment itself - I'll admit some aspects were okay in terms of Jackie being concerned about her grades and working on homework, but it feels like the scope was too narrow with respect to this being a story set in a college environment. It's proposed to be a large university measure, but I didn't really feel like it was that significant to the story, and aspects of it, like Erin McCarthy's \"True\" and even Jamie McGuire's \"Beautiful Disaster\" - felt more like a secluded high school environment. I get that the sorority/fraternity segments were clique-ish and somewhat isolated compared to the rest of campus, but it still felt like the tone of this story communicated this overarching acceptance of the strife that Jackie among some of the other characters endured with Buck's actions, but the story made it seem like the characters affected were the only ones speaking out against it. If you've followed some of the cases in the media about rape/sexual assault on a college campus shown here , it's a more complex issue with multiple sides and dimensions, and with people striving to figure ways to approach the issue - administrators, students, instructors, campus groups, etc. I got angry with this book for narrowing it in such a scope in comparison to the \"love\" story here. It could've been a much more constructive, dimensional story, but it didn't go as far to show it in a realistic fashion. Long story short, this narrative didn't really wow me or bring me into its respective relationships, conflicts, among other dimensions. It not only limits the discussion and presentation of a tough issue, but also delves into formulaic, problematic romantic cliches, doesn't present the matters in a realistic spectrum, and doesn't necessarily delve into a coming to terms on a number of levels. Even for some moments of construction for what it provided, it wasn't enough, and sometimes even contradictory or inaccurate. I'll leave you with a song that came to mind when thinking about tattooed tormented heroes (which this book tried to show, but it didn't necessarily show Lucas's story all that well, nor with respect to the heroine's actions), people who lose their way or experience great deals of strife. It came to mind as I wrote this review. Pat Benatar's \"Somebody's Baby\" is a punch gut song, and I think of the opening scene where it shows a 29-year old father - shirtless and sporting tattoos, standing with his son. The video puts a brief statement of his story alongside the fact that he loves his kid. I actually felt more for the stories of the men in that video than I did for any of the males in this book, Lucas included. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rhUHD... Overall score: 2/5 ...more Wow. Just wow. I'm actually pretty blown away by 'Easy'. This wasn't your average 'boy meets girl' story at all. Unbelievably well-written, 'Easy' kicks ass for so many reasons.

The romance plays out perfectly, from their first awkward yet sexually charged encounters through to the taut, spine-tinglingly delicious journey of revelations between them.

I assumed I had the plot all figured out; I assumed the \"thing\" I figured out would be annoyingly dragged out throughout the entire book. I assumed! I assumed! I ASSUMED!!

It's steamy Divinyls hot! It'll drive you absolutely wild! My one and only complaint was after all the toe curling \"foreconnecting\", the actual \"connecting\" was a little disappointing. The climax was a little anticlimactic (*giggle* and puntastic). Greatness knocked and Tammara Webber answered and the answer was Easy . Easy to fall in love with the characters, easy to get hooked on an amazing plot, easy to agonize over the fact there was only 10 pages left, and easy to be left wanting more!
