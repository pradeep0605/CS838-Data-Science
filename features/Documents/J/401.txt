Cornwell is a master of captured the drama of history from different perspective and making the story come alive. And in that, he's very successful here. It's clear he's done his research and knows his history. He knows the nuances of the period and ably weaves them into the story. He does this by creating a character we can follow and genuinely care about. Nick is an archer in training who quickly becomes an outlaw. He strikes a priest, trying to do the right thing and is forced to flee England. He becomes a mercenary in France, but is forced to return home. There he comes under the sovreign of the king and is put back into the archer core to fight and take back the throne of France. Along the way, he saves a nun from being raped and eventually takes her as his wife (Cornwell points out that convents were used to \"hide\" women to prevent noble men from taking advantage of them and producing bastard offspring.). The best parts of the story are the battles. Cornwell excels in creating vivid, realistic and compelling battle sequences that will draw you in and keep the pages turning. Where the novel loses a bit of steam is during the moments in between where we have to set things up for the next battle. I can understand why they must be done and they do make the history of the period and events come more alive. But they just pale in comparison to the battle sequences. Whether this is a fair criticism or not, I will leave to fellow readers to decide. ...more Bernard Cornwell is absolutely terrible at showing the softer side of war.

My favourite writers in this genre are Conn Iggulden and Bernard Cornwell, although there are many others who light up all of my lights. There are many books about the Battle of Agincourt, but this has to rate as one of the best. That is unless you want the non-fiction, factual version of events. But who is to say what is factual? There is even much disagreement amongst the scholars of the period. The story, as told by Cornwell, follows the life of an archer, Nick Hook. He is outlawed early in the narration for hitting a priest. The priest deserved much more than a punch in the stomach for what he did, but Hook would've been caught and hung had he meted out the correct justice. Nick is a brilliant archer, and soon finds himself in France, in Soissons, where he witnesses some horrendous betrayal and violence, but those events lead to one positive outcome: he meets the lady who is eventually to become his wife. I can't say much more without giving away the whole story, and I don't want to spoil it for you. There is a lot of graphic violence in this book, but it is, I believe, the reality of that age. (view spoiler) [One totally unbelievable episode in the book comes towards the end. Sir Martin eventually manages to corner Hook's wife, Melisande, and attempts to rape her. Whilst pinned down by her assailant, she manages to reach into her personal sack with one hand, load her crossbow, jam it between her body and his (wouldn't it be too big?), and pull the trigger. Ridiculous! If she'd stabbed him in the neck with a crossbow bolt, or a small dagger, I could've swallowed that, but this version of events was just impossible! (hide spoiler) ] The narrative was generally fast flowing, but there were occasions when there was just too much detail, and that slowed the whole story down and irritated me somewhat. I also felt that the book could really have benefited from the inclusion of a glossary of definitions of armoury, clothing, weaponry and other terms of the age. I don't wish to interrupt my enjoyment of the story by breaking off to consult my dictionary or encyclopaedia. This small criticism aside, this is a really great read, and I would recommend it to all fans of historical fiction and Bernard Cornwell. Note: You may well ask, \"Why <+++>Azincourt</+++> rather that Agincourt ?\" The answer is that this is, and was, the correct spelling of the name of the nearby village which gave its name to the famous battle. ...more ***Note: I apologize for the misspelling of Cornwell as Cromwell.

I became a little tired of the scene, but I realized this book is about a battle and so what did I expect. I love the writing style of Bernard Cornwell. I am excited to read his other historical fiction books, which are not so heavy on battle scenes. However, anyone interested in reading his work should be prepared for bad language and violence. Keep in mind that life was very much like he describes in his books, so it's not gratuitous. It is the way things were. Cornwell does incredible amount of research. It brings his characters to life and puts you in the middle of the story. You can see, smell and taste the historical settings. He added a relationship to this book. It gave the story a sweetness that contrasted beautifully with the treacherous world and even has a happy ending! ...more A riveting and graphic fictionalized account of Henry V's campaign in France in 1415, from the seige of Harfleur to the Battle of Agincourt, told from the viewpoint of a lowly English archer.

Bernard Cornwell is not a literary writer, and his characterization is fairly shallow. The personality of his characters mostly comes through in their dialogue - but that works quite well in a book like this one. I enjoyed Sir John Cornewaille's heated, filthy rants against the French, and the way his confessor Father Christopher solemnly assures him that God feels exactly the same way. The opening chapters, which establish a background for the protagonist, are admittedly awkward. If I had been unfamiliar with Cornwell I might have abandoned this book early on. By the time our archer joins King Henry's forces in London, however, I was hooked. What Cornwell does quite well is to describe what it's like to string and aim and shoot a longbow; or what it's like to don armor, piece by exquisite piece, when the battle is imminent. What it would sound like to be on the battlefield with thousands of arrows raining down. How an armored knight might struggle, hardly able to see through a closed visor, barely able to lift his feet out of thick, clinging mud. He can vividly describe exactly the technique used to kill men and horses (why do I cringe more for the horses?) with arrows, with lances, with swords, and with poleaxes - or what it's like to watch women raped as the spoils of war. Cornwell is good at seamlessly blending an individual soldier's experience with an account of the overall action. A few simple maps are included, and there's an informative Historical Note at the end. Cornwell mentions the legend that the British two-fingered salute originated among the archers at Agincourt as a symbol of defiance and triumph - the French had announced their intention to cut off the arrow-shooting fingers of the English bowmen. ...more This is a thrilling, moving, informative and entertaining narrative of the battle of Agincourt (of Shakespeare's Henry V fame).

I was completely addicted to the audiobook for days on end. Could not stop listening. And I simply cannot recommend it to anyone else to read. Unless, of course, you already live on a diet of blood, gore and profanity, and will therefore not be deeply disturbed by the all-to-real imagery of life and war in the 15th century. I've struggled to understand if the degree of gruesomeness presented in this book was simply gratuitous or if it was necessary to accurately convey the conditions of the time. I think I've concluded that softening the blows (so to speak) would indeed have reduced some of the book's power. The story is primarily told through the eyes of a single lowly English archer who is possessed of great strength and prowess in battle, but who grows in honor and compassion as the book develops. This growth places him in stark contrast to the crass, cruel world in which he lives and fights. There are other very appealing characters as well: a tenacious love interest from the enemy side; her brutal, yet oddly caring nobleman father; and Sir John Cornwall, the archer's commander, whose ferocity and acrid leadership is matched only by his unyielding loyalty to his men. If you lack stomach for vivid descriptions of they myriad ways in which 15th century soldiers slaughtered and avenged themselves on their enemies, read Henry V instead. Or go watch the 1989 movie of the same by Kenneth Branagh, which I haven't seen but my very tasteful wife highly recommends. But if you're not prone to a queasy stomach or bad dreams, this book may be well worth it. It left me feeling unusually grateful to have a 21st century desk job. ...more Alright...those who know me...now you have all picked yourselves up off the floor I will explain the dismal rating.

An example of what I mean by literal writing would be.. The sky was blue. The trees were green. They sat on the grass and ate bread. There were flies and a wind. (NB*that is not a quote from the book). The gore is ridiculously described, the characters are one dimensional, annoying and cliched and to me, do not work. The voices in his head were irritating and got on my nerve. So, after wallowing in my guilt for half a day and wondering how it is possible that I could not like a Cornwell book. And knowing that so many loved this book and only the minority give it 2 or 1 stars, I finally decided to give it up and face the music. ...more Enjoyable Historical war fiction after a long time. I don't have a good knowledge of world history or European history, and started this book only because of the lure of a group read. Am happy that I did, because I could enrich my knowledge in a fun way. Loved the main characters and the depictions of the battle scene and soldier's lives. Nick Hook, Melisande, Sir John, Father Francis, King Henry, Tom Wilte and their comrades will live on in my memory for quite some time. Listened to this on Audible and it was just as good as I remembered. Colourful characters - and curses - and an excellent build up to the famous battle. In true Bernard style, the story follows an English archer and the people around him, friend and foe. Highly recommended for history buffs and action fans alike - the fights and battles are visceral and brutal and face to face personal. Provavelmente o livro mais visceral e cru do Cornwell.

Apesar de toda essa brutalidade mostrada na guerra, o livro tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 recheado de passagens sarc\u00e1sticas e conversas muito bem-humoradas entre os personagens: \"- Briga de fam\u00edlia, garoto, \u00e9 o pior tipo de briga que existe \u2013 dissera John Wilkinson.\" Ao longo da narrativa, Nicholas se encontra com diversos personagens marcantes em sua vida, como a freira Melisande, outros bons arqueiros como ele e, principalmente, Sir John Cornwaille. O cavaleiro \u00e9 imprescind\u00edvel no desenvolvimento de Hook como pessoa e tamb\u00e9m como guerreiro, pois o ensina a lutar com outros tipos de arma al\u00e9m do arco longo e tamb\u00e9m lhe d\u00e1 algumas li\u00e7\u00f5es de vida que ficar\u00e3o para sempre em sua mem\u00f3ria: \"... Mate ou seja morto, dizia sempre Sir John, e Hook correu para o homem, com a acha levantada, o cabo seguro com as duas m\u00e3os, ignorou o d\u00e9bil golpe defensivo de espada que o homem ofereceu e estocou com a ponta da lan\u00e7a contra a cintura do franc\u00eas.\" E eu tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o posso esquecer de deixar aqui para voc\u00eas um quote com uma clara demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o de como s\u00e3o as descri\u00e7\u00f5es minuciosas do autor: \"O marechal n\u00e3o usava elmo. Seu cabelo era castanho-escuro, cortado muito curto e ficando grisalho nas t\u00eamporas, e emoldurava um rosto de tamanha ferocidade que Hook ficou pasmo. Era um rosto quadrado, rijo, com cicatrizes e quebrado, sofrido em batalha e pela vida, mas n\u00e3o derrotado. Um rosto duro, rosto de homem, rosto de guerreiro, com olhos escuros penetrantes que examinavam homens e cavalos em busca de sinais de suas condi\u00e7\u00f5es. Sua boca estava fixa numa linha s\u00e9ria, mas de repente ele sorriu ao ver o padre Christopher, e no sorriso Hook viu um homem capaz de inspirar outros homens a grande lealdade e vit\u00f3rias.\" Voc\u00eas ir\u00e3o gostar muito desse livro, tenho certeza! A rixa da fam\u00edlia Hook com a fam\u00edlia Perrill se estende por todas as p\u00e1ginas e rende v\u00e1rios momentos de apreens\u00e3o.

The Longbow is credited for winning not only The Agincourt Battle, but the Crecy one as well. The English could not be defeated in an open field. Even with 6000 English and 30,000 French (according to Cornwell) which is why the Agincourt Battle went down in history as one of England's most successful battles. Cornwell tells the story around Nick Hook (an archer) who starts his life as a forester, becomes an outlaw through an in town rivalry and finds his way into the service of the King. Cornwell tells us the historical details without any sugarcoating. Be forewarned. This is a war story. There are lots of violence and rape scenes. I believe the author tries to soften it a little by having Saint Crispin's spirit speaking to Nick (who Nick has been praying to) and a little love story that seems unrealistic. I would have preferred more historical detail. When the archers would ask questions, one would simply say \"who knows, my job is to simply be here.\" I'm sure many of them probably didn't know, but the author had the opportunity to fill his readers in, instead of assuming we knew. Maybe that was his way of keeping us in Nick's head. Who knows? I've spent the morning googling to fill in the blanks. For us history fans, I do believe this is worth the read. I have Cornwell's Saxon series by the bed. ...more Unfortunately, I read this after reading Cormac McCarthy's 'All The Pretty Horses'. I think I'd have liked it much better if I hadn't. The death toll feels about the same in both books, but Cornwell is writing an adventure, so if he kills off 3,000 in a day, it seems to be all in a day's work. McCarthy can get more feeling into one murder that happens out of the narrator's sight. On the plus side he really seems to have done his research (though at the end of the book he recommends Robert Hardy's Unfortunately, I read this after reading Cormac McCarthy's 'All The Pretty Horses'.

On the minus side he has a pair of interfering saints who keep talking in the hero's head. I can't complain that everyone that he mentions this to refrains from having the mad bugger locked up - it was a time of belief and they have reactions that seem plausible for their time. I'm going to complain, however, that Cornwell doesn't seem to feel any need to explain away this runaway divine intervention, that isn't a reaction that I feel is plausible for this time. ...more Azincourt gets 3 Stars because a)Cornwell writes a great battle scene and b)who cares what else, I read it for the battle scenes, none better.

No, that's not fair...there is one (sort of) good point and about 50 (genuine) bad points. So I'll start with the good point.

What I tend to do, when I wish to read something which has the sole quality of historical accuracy, is read a history book. If I'm reading a novel, there is a shedload of other qualities which I seek. So, let's run through them and go over how Azincourt marked... Characters. To be truthful, the characters in this were very poorly, possibly even lazily conceived. What can you say about Nick Hook after reading this. Archer, who is a bit of a rogue and who is quite tough. That's as deep as it goes. And as for Sir John, it would be impossible for me to describe his character without referring to the Hugh Laurie characters in the Blackadder series (if you haven't seen this,check it out on YouTube and you will instantly recognize what I mean). This is mainly as a result of crap dialogue... Dialogue. When someone speaks, there is a rhythm to the manner in which they talk. Someone who is from inner city New York will have a different manner in their speaking than someone who has been educated in Cambridge University and hails from Kensington, London. There are a hundred other factors which affect the fashion with which someone talks and converses. To capture these variations in the written form is one of the more challenging aspects of writing. However, having been informed that Cornwell is one of the big players in historical fiction, I thought he was just the man to be up to it. He wasn't. Not for adult fiction in any case. Cornwell needs to neurologically get off his arse and expand his vocabulary for a start. I often found the Americanism, 'goddamned' written three or four times on one page. I once found it written twice in the same sentence! Add to this the numerous 'turd-sucking','cabbage-shitting' and 'fart' renditions during this novel (largely spoken by Hugh Laur-, I mean Sir John) and it would be enough to frustrate a moderately well educated ten year old. Storyline. Basically, with a historical novel, the story is already half written, to a greater or lesser degree. Certainly, the author has the backstory in place. They just have to superimpose their own tale within the given historical setting. They can therefore give themselves more room to maneouvre with regards to developing this tale. Cornwell has made a prime balls up of this opportunity. The main goodie (Nick Hook) has some baddies to deal with (the Perrills, Father Martin and Lanferelle). All the baddies are killed by Nick and some supporting goodies, while Lanferelle realizes it is wrong to be a baddie and turns goodie by the end of the story. Add in some clich\u00e9d love nonsense, with aforementioned crap dialogue and characterisation, and you have a perfect recipe for a very poor novel. In fact if you go over all the points in the last couple of sentences and have a good think, it is basically the same plotline as Star Wars and I'd be buggered if a novelization of that would be top of my to-read list. To conclude, Bernard Cornwell has been pretty slack and lazy on this. I don't know if I would risk reading another novel by him and being faced with the same low quality tosh. There are better books out there. Far better books. ...more A fascinating look at the conquering of France with the longbow. It shows the brutality of the time, how powerful the church was and the great difference between the lords and the rest of the population. No matter how small a role a character has in this story I still found them interesting and how could you not love Sir John! I think Bernard Cornwell is fast becoming one of my favorite writers I have always been a big fan of the Middle Ages. Well, let me rephrase that. I find it interesting, but I definitely would not have wanted to live back then. I ran across a number of book reviews for this while doing orders for books at work, and after I read Jondude's review, I knew that I had to move it to the top of my to-read pile. I am really glad that I did. It all starts with Nicholas Hook in the English countryside.

I ran across a number of book reviews for this while doing orders for books at work, and after I read Jondude's review, I knew that I had to move it to the top of my to-read pile. I am really glad that I did. It all starts with Nicholas Hook in the English countryside. He works as a forester, someone who maintains the local noble's forest by hunting game and preventing poachers from doing the same. He is of the lower working class and is basically a good person, but he finds himself on the run after getting in trouble in his village. His family has a multi-generation blood feud with another family in town that has led to no shortage of deaths on either side. The most recent incident ends with him hitting a priest, an ally of the other family, who is about to rape a young woman. Hook ends up serving in France, supporting the Burgundian resistance to French overrule. Things come to a head at Soissons, a small city in the northeast, and the French massacre, rape, and pillage their own people, many of them women and children. It is there that Nicholas rescues Melisande, a French bastard of a local lord who has placed her in a nunnery for safety. Obviously, that didn't work out as planned. As a result of his actions at Soissons, Hook finds himself back in England with the new lord willing to take him into service despite his past errors. They will all be serving in Henry V's army as they attack France in the hopes of supporting Henry's claim to the French throne. Hook, a master archer, finds himself in the center of all the action thanks to his skills as the English attack and capture an unimportant port village and strike out across France to ensure success. It is these actions that place a smaller English force at Agincourt, where they will have to take on a superior force of French nobleman. Throughout the book, Hook finds strength in the images of St. Crispin and his brother St. Crispinian, who visit him regularly when he most needs support. The book artfully takes the reader through the various battle scenes. Cornwell does nothing to spare the reader the harsh details of medieval warfare. Swords pierce various body parts, leaving trails of viscera, intestines, and other lovely images. If you like high action, this is probably a book that you will enjoy this one. There is a strong Author's Note at the conclusion that shows how Cornwell used a number of legitimate resources to base his book upon. This includes details like character names, setting details, and battle techniques. ...more Cornwell's 1415 battle opus, AZINCOURT, is his stand-alone retelling of the famous battle in which Henry V and the English army took on the might of France on St Crispin's Day. What's surprising is that this famous and humungous battle only occupies that last fifth or so of the book and before then we get lots of build up and other events that came before. I'm in two minds about this novel. When it works, it really works. Cornwell always weaves in the little story and the big story, and it's the Cornwell's 1415 battle opus, AZINCOURT, is his stand-alone retelling of the famous battle in which Henry V and the English army took on the might of France on St Crispin's Day.

I'm in two minds about this novel. When it works, it really works. Cornwell always weaves in the little story and the big story, and it's the big story that makes this story tick. The assault on Soissons, the siege at Harfleur and the battle of Agincourt itself are handled adroitly from this well-experienced author. The fights are grimmer and gorier than ever, with all manner of bodily destruction and mutilation described within these pages. So far, this is probably the most violent Cornwell story I've read. The little story is where this effort falls down. Nicholas Hook is a bit of a faceless protagonist, a typical stock hero-type who's readily interchangable with Sharpe, Nathaniel Starbuck, Thomas of Hookton, etc. The villains are even worse: once again there's a corrupt priest (this one an obvious version of Obediah Hakeswill) who's almost a caricature and some others who fail to make much of an impact. Their story feels artificial and it gets in the way of the important stuff. The hero soldiers who appear in supporting roles, such as Sir John Cornwaille and Melisande's father, are much more entertaining and larger than life. And the constant action is beautifully described with maximum interest; Cornwell seems to make this stuff effortless and a joy to read. So my advice is to concentrate on the big picture when you read this one. ...more I learned just what I expected - all the gory details about these particular medieval battles: Soissons (which I had never heard of before), Harfleur, and Agincourt (Azincourt is the French spelling - I assume that's what they called the book in Europe; my book is called Agincourt but these tiny pictures are hard to identify so I'm stuck with the \"z\" here).

At least he didn't describe anyone's dysentary in detail! I had known in theory what fighting in plate mail was like but this is the real thing, and I find that I didn't really want to know. The description of the battle of Agincourt went on just a tad too long (maybe twenty, thirty pages) and it all ended rather abruptly. I felt like the characters were made up just to give this factual information a more palatable, fictional form, but this was as much a non-fiction work as anything. I never really cared all that much about the characters except Sir John Cornwaille, who I believe (if I'm remembering correctly from college) may have been the inspiration for Falstaff. Watch a movie of Shakespeare's \"Henry V,\" plunge \"once more into the breach,\" wish \"not one man more\" on St. Crispin's Day, and you'll have a lot more fun. ...more This is the first Bernard Cornwell book I've reviewed on Goodreads, which means it is entirely too long since I have read a Bernard Cornwell book!

I'm a casual fan of Cornwell, having read some of his books\u2014I'm particularly fond of his Arthurian trilogy, and I like his Hundred Years' War stuff\u2014and eschewing others\u2014like the Sharpe series, or the Starbuck series, because those two historical periods appeal less to me. That is the most enduring and endearing thing about Cornwell: his remarkable versatility as a writer of historical fiction. Give him a time period, any time period, and a battle, and he will find a character and a story that fits. Azincourt demonstrates this skill perfectly with the character of Nicolas Hook, an archer who finds himself at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. I rather liked Nicolas, and that surprises me, because he seems like a rapscallion and\u2014sometimes\u2014a coward. After all, it takes the voices of saints to urge him on to commit noble deeds! But Nicolas is just so earnest, especially toward the end of the book, that he won me over almost without Cornwell's help. He begins the story as a young, very naive forester who becomes an outlaw and gets exiled to France. By the time we reach the Battle of Agincourt, he is a leader of men, a husband, and a true warrior. And Nicolas recognizes these changes, especially the last one, for he meditates on what it means to be a warrior and why he fights for king and country. Cornwell captures the spirit of the battle, particularly among the common soldiers present at Agincourt. I think it is easy to project our own contemporary, 20th-century nationalism back onto these soldiers, and that creates a rather inaccurate view of why these men were fighting. Yes, there was plenty of nationalism to go around, because the English hated the French, so if you were an Englishman, you sure didn't mind helping a few Frenchmen die. Sure, Henry V had a claim to the French throne. But it was a dubious claim, and these men-at-arms and archers are not scholars. They don't care about the legitimacy of claims, and they aren't necessarily fighting for Henry because he's an awesome guy or because he's their king. Many of the nobles, and a good deal of the common soldiers, are fighting for gold and glory. And many of them fight because they think God is on their side. So it all comes down to gold, God, and glory, as my grade 11 history teacher liked to say. The nobility could capture noble prisoners for ransom, and the common folk could always acquire some nice armour, weapons, or trinkets from the corpses. Spoils of war. And if you survive to return to England, you return a war hero. The ladies like that. Despite its place in history as a celebrated victory of underdogs, the Battle of Agincourt was not some great triumph of the good English over the bad French, and it wasn't even a very good idea. It was a stupid move by Henry to march his forces to Calais. But he too was motivated by gold, God, and glory; he had creditors he couldn't disappoint, not to mention nobility who were always eager to see a succession crisis of their own. Agincourt is not about nobility and political intrigue, however much I like that sort of story. And that's fine. Nicolas instead gives us the commoner's perspective: he's fighting because, as an outlaw, living in England is rather dangerous, and he does need money. Plus, he has a personal connection with this campaign against the French. Since the sacking of Soissons by the French army, and Nicolas' rescue of his eventual wife, Melisande, Nicolas has been hearing the voices of St. Crispin and St. Crispinian. They want him to be their avenging angel for the tragedy at Soissons. So Nicolas marches off to war, but Cornwell doesn't get around to the Battle of Agincourt until much later in the story. In fact, most of the book isn't about Agincourt at all. And that's fine too. I don't see how Cornwell could have sustained interest for a reasonable length of novel just focusing on Agincourt; although the siege of Harfleur is more drawn-out and perhaps less dramatic, it has its own kind of suspense that makes it no less interesting. In his descriptions of the siege preparations and execution, from Nicolas' role as an archer to the Welsh diggers and the horrible living conditions, Cornwell shows us that he knows his stuff. And thanks to his vivid depictions of the gory carnage of war and the battlefield, Cornwell shows us that he knows how to show that he knows his stuff. Dry exposition Agincourt is not. There is a lot of frank gore and violence in this book, and I think that's worth noting for people who would be hesitant to read such things. Cornwell does not gloss over the details of battle: he loves the skull-bashing of the pole-axe, the slopping of entrails over one's feet, etc. And I respect this kind of writing, even if it isn't my favourite thing to read, because it goes a long way to depicting the horrors of war. This is not a game, and if you are not a hardened veteran like Nicolas has become, then you are out of luck. Like Nicolas' poor brother, Michael, you may be eaten, chewed up, and spit out if you are too faint of heart. It is a good reminder not to over-romanticize this part of the past: sure, they had cool weapons, but I definitely would not want to live back then. So Azincourt is more than just a single battle, even if it is not quite an entire war. It is a gradual, wending narrative that intersects with Henry V's campaign against France, told from the point of view of an archer who finds he needs to put to rest the demons of his past: the ghost of Sarah, whom he couldn't save, and the honour of Melisande, whom he did. He takes solace from the fact that saints talk to him, even though it also weirds him out. This was not my favourite part of the book either. We never get an explanation for why Crispin and Crispinian are talking to Nicolas (or if he's just hallucinating). Considering the very pious, credulous nature of the time, I think that is OK\u2014but it still seemed out of place amidst the rest of Cornwell's hyperreal narrative. And juxtaposed with Father Christopher's accurate observations about both sides, English and French, invoking the name of God in their fight against the enemy, the presence of two saints pulling for an English archer is a little weird, and it undermines that otherwise very valid point. I don't want to say \"read this book\" with all the certainty of a hearty recommendation, because I know it isn't for everyone. Meticulously researched but very well-written, Azincourt is something you might like if you are into military historical fiction, or even if that time period just fascinates you. As far its place in Cornwell's oeuvre goes, it definitely isn't close to being my favourite, but it is certainly a competently-executed novel that has a flair for dramatic but believable battle sequences. And it helps that it is based on a true underdog story. Archery has always been cool; archery at Agincourt pretty much set the standard against which all other archery coolness is measured. ...more Talvez eu fa\u00e7a uma resenha melhor em breve, mas fica aqui minha satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 esta obra de Bernard Cornwell . \u00d3tima narra\u00e7\u00e3o, riqueza de detalhes sobre \u00e9picas batalhas e os pesares de uma guerra, mesmo antes dessa acontecer.

I\u2019ve been recently introduced to the legend that is Bernard Cornwell through his Sharpe series. Although I\u2019ve only read Sharpe\u2019s Tiger, I\u2019ve seen the TV series with Sean Bean in them and found them to be pretty interesting, and I have been meaning to check out his non-Sharpe novels for a while now. Ever since I brought Azincourt in a supermarket recently, I knew it was going to be read and reviewed soon. And as it turns out, Azincourt is one of the best historical fiction novels that I\u2019ve had the pleasure of reading, although - unfortunately, it\u2019s not without its flaws. Bernard Cornwell has been thinking about this subject for years. He has long wanted to write a book about a single battle, the events that lead up to it, the actual days in the battle and the aftermath from multiple viewpoints. Agincourt, fought on October 25th 1415, on St Crispin\u2019s Day, is one of the best known battles, in part through the brilliant depiction of it in Shakespeare\u2019s Henry V, in part because it was a brilliant and unexpected English victory and in part because it was the first battle won by the use of the longbow. This was a weapon developed in this form only by the English \u2013 parishes were forced to train boys from as young as eight daily \u2013 and enabled them to dominate the European battlefields for the rest of the century. Lively historical characters abound on all sides but in Bernard Cornwell\u2019s hands the fictional characters, horsemen, archers, nobles, peasants are authentic and vivid, and the hour by hour view of the battle is dramatic and gripping. Azincourt is a wonderful read. It\u2019s gritty, dark and action-packed. The novel\u2019s best part is clearly the battles, and Cornwell demonstrates his skill at writing them well. You can\u2019t get any better writer at battles in the medieval ages than Bernard Cornwell, as he makes the reader feel like we\u2019re there, fighting with the main characters, struggling against the French. The author has done his research well and I didn\u2019t notice any glaring historical inaccuracies, which is always a good thing when you\u2019re reading Historical Fiction. Although the actual battle of Azincourt doesn\u2019t take place until the latter half of the novel, it\u2019s worth the wait, and when it hits, it hits with a bang. You get to see everybody from King <---C>Henry V of England</---C> from Nicholas Hook, common Archer and the main protagonist of this novel in action, and Cornwell has written the tale superbly well. The novel is told in third person which allows for multiple narratives and a look into characters from both the British and the French side (although the focus is mainly on the British), and the only real problem is with this is it\u2019s much harder to get into the main characters heads. From what I saw in the Sharpe TV series, we get a similar formula used for the plot here, except only in Azincourt, and not in the Napoleonic Wars. A common soldier. Check. Aforementioned common soldier will fight heroically in every battle, and often emerge on top. Check. We get a love interest for the same common soldier. Check. In this case it\u2019s Melisande. However, whilst this may be a similar format to what fans of Bernard Cornwell\u2019s Sharpe series will be used to, it\u2019s done so well that you won\u2019t care about this. Cornwell\u2019s tale is action-packed, and the pace manages to be kept consistently all the way through. I have a feeling that Cornwell fans will have brought Azincourt already, but I don\u2019t know why I\u2019ve put this off for so long. I believe my next purchase from this author will be The Fort, as I\u2019ve wanted to read more about the American Revolutionary War for a while now. The author doesn\u2019t shy away from the blood and the gore elements of the battle, and we\u2019re reminded just how unpleasant that the middle ages was. The novel moves along at a fast pace, and we get a variety of action sequences in order to keep the reader entertained. Although Cornwell could have made us feel more attached to our characters and perhaps developed them more, Azincourt still manages to be an engaging read. The next novel written by Cornwell, which I will no doubt be buying as well, is titled 1356 and is released in September this year, published by Harper Collins in the UK, and tells the story of the Battle of Poitiers in 1356, an area of history which I know very little about.

I will say one thing for Cornwell, and that is that he certainly does his research. There were lots of great little period details throughout and Cornwell does well in ensuring that these details are relayed naturally through the storytelling, as opposed to cramming endless minutiae down our throats at every turn. Of course not all his facts should be taken as canon, especially where the actual battle of Agincourt is concerned. Scholars argue to this day about topics such as how many men each side had, how many died, the true impact of the longbow, and more. So again, if the subject matter interests you I encourage you to do your own research. Typical for historical fictions our story is grounded in a small group non-historical characters who interact with the real life figures and take part in the historical events we are witnessing. In this case the story centers around an archer named Nicholas Hook, and the people that are important in his life. I'm OK with that approach as it tends to work, yet this approach is also my major complaint in this tale. You see, I never find myself caring that much for Hook and his friends in this book. Cornwell's writing follows the approved style for historical fiction to the tee, and in doing so, providing a juxtaposition between the \"real life\" of the characters and the real history, both elements of the story are robbed of effectiveness. I never really grow attached to Hook, or even get a clear picture of the man, as he marches inexorably towards the climax of the book. The characters are interesting, but frequently seem unfinished and vague. In this respect Cornwell could learn from Patrick OBrian's wonderful characterizations. From the historical side of things, the storytelling is relatively clear, but lacking in passion, and it seems as if Cornwell missed an opportunity to humanize the brutal warfare of times past. Frequently a casual comment is made about hundreds or thousands of men dying in battle (and this is usually in-your-face, brutal, vicious warfare) and then we move on, as if it were nothing. This seeming read-by-numbers approach really takes you away from the gritty reality at times and robs this book of the humanity that often makes tales of warfare so poignant. In the end I did enjoy this book, yet found it was a missed opportunity to really bring the story of Agincourt to life, relying instead on a formulaic style that lacks sound and fury. Regardless, it is a good book and, as stated earlier, if this sort of story interests you then your time is not wasted here. ...more Bernard Cornwell really cranks up the heat of battle in this fine historical novel. I always like a writer who is confident enough in the quality of his work that he can take time to write a note at the end and tell where he deviated from history, or where he just guessed a few things. However, the wonderful historical information at the back of this book (the author's notes on touring the battlefield, Henry V's speech from Shakespeare's play, a Carol to Henry V, and an interview with the author Bernard Cornwell really cranks up the heat of battle in this fine historical novel.

However, the wonderful historical information at the back of this book (the author's notes on touring the battlefield, Henry V's speech from Shakespeare's play, a Carol to Henry V, and an interview with the author telling why he choose to tell the story from the archer's point of view, which all make for interesting reading-- AFTER you've read the novel, are not the appeal here. The appeal here is the story of a medieval band of brothers, fighting for the landed gentry because they believe it is the right thing to do, and the blood and guts of battle that made images similar to the film BRAVEHEART flash in my mind as I read this book. It is blood and guts, down in the trenches writing. The appeal doesn't stop there. First, Cornwell does an excellent job of getting the reader to care about those men. He does so by having his story follow Nicholas Hook, who tends game for his Lord and has an ongoing feud with another family. This feud raises its ugly head over and over throughout the plot. Oddly enough, Cornwell presents the gentry, the landed nobility, in such a noble light as to be almost beyond belief. While he writes the story of the common man caught up in a struggle between kings (The King of England was claiming that the throne of France was rightly his) and yet with few exceptions, all of these commoners seem to have a great respect for the nobility, even those nobles on the opposite side. But note that I said ALMOST beyond belief. After some careful thinking I realized that this attitude towards nobility would have been very strong amongst common men or else the nobility would not have existed. I would have expected our hero to resent being bonded to a Lord-- but he seems delighted. Wouldn't he have to have a postive attitude about serving a Lord just to survive? Of course he would have to show respect. Cornwell, with few exceptions shows these gentrys as being noble in character and therefore worthy of respect. There are no Priunce John types in this book. No despots or wicked nobles. Some are a bit selfish, but we never seen any real oppression going on with the exception of the religious persecution of the Lollards. This was a great book, a wonderful historical novel, and worth reading. ...more More good stuff from Cornwell. This is my first book of his that isn't in the Saxon Tales series, but I was sure that I'd get the same Cornwell goodness despite the unfamiliar territory. I first learned about the famous battle at Agincourt from the film version of Henry V and the concept interested me, especially considering that the English were outnumbered and far from home yet managed to win a decisive victory.

I'm not sure whether or not it was because of the relatively limited scope in comparison to the Saxon stuff but I came off of this one feeling more entertained than educated. The cultural stuff from the Saxon series is less prevalent in favor of more information about the methods of warfare of the times, which was definitely fascinating but I did want to know more about the societal and religious structures, etc. By this point I know that Cornwell draws from familiar archetypes when he creates his characters, but it doesn't stop me from having emotional reactions to them. I liked Nick, Melisande, and Sir John, and hated the Perrills and Sir Martin. He just knows how to bring them to life and give them enough color and character to where they seem like familiar, real people despite the relative lack of complexity compared to some other authors. I've probably stated this before in my reviews of his stuff but that's one of the things I like about Cornwell. You know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are, and you know that the good guys are gonna come out on top and the bad guys are gonna suffer a horrible yet justified death. That said, there definitely were a few curveballs regarding certain characters' fates that I didn't see coming. Of course, one of Cornwell's obvious strengths is his vivid depiction of violent struggle in his books, and he certainly didn't pull any punches in this one. There's a terrifying sack of a city, an exhausting and incredibly destructive siege, and of course the climactic titular battle which, for me, rivaled the insane battle at Ethandun from The Pale Horseman . It never fails to stun me that this stuff actually happened. It just seems almost fantastical or something. It's hard for me to come to grips with the reality of these events but Cornwell definitely makes it easier. My only problem after reading this book is the decision of which of his to go with next. ...more Recently, my dad asked if the first Bernard Cornwell novel he lent me in high school (Sharpe\u2019s Eagle) set me on the path to majoring in history. It probably did. Cornwell is a master of historical fiction. Specifically, he\u2019s a master of historical military fiction. His Richard Sharpe series follows a British solider through the Napoleonic Wars. I remember being totally enthralled by those books, to the point that I packed six of them to take on a week-long vacation, and read all six with time to Recently, my dad asked if the first Bernard Cornwell novel he lent me in high school (Sharpe\u2019s Eagle) set me on the path to majoring in history.

His Richard Sharpe series follows a British solider through the Napoleonic Wars. I remember being totally enthralled by those books, to the point that I packed six of them to take on a week-long vacation, and read all six with time to spare. After I finished Sharpe\u2019s Devil, the last in the series, I went to the library and borrowed a biography of Thomas Cochrane, a Royal Navy captain who figured prominently in the conclusion. That was the first non-fiction book I read for fun. So I\u2019m probably not in a position to review any of Cornwell\u2019s other books objectively. But here goes. Agincourt is Cornwell\u2019s retelling of Britain\u2019s most famous victory during the Hundred Years\u2019 War. The battle saw the army of Henry V overcome a numerically superior French force (which may have been several times as large) on a muddy field in 1415, largely due to the prowess of Henry\u2019s longbowmen. Nick Hook, the novel\u2019s protagonist, is one of those bowmen. He\u2019s not all that likeable at the story\u2019s outset in 1414, when he\u2019s just a forester trying to kill a man in the name of a generations-old family feud. But after failing to save a girl from rape, Hook becomes increasingly pious. And during the French sack of Soissons, he survives by following the directions of what he believes to be the voices of Saints Crispin and Crispinian, the city\u2019s patron saints. Eventually, Hook\u2019s new self-belief\u2014and skill with a bow\u2014earn him a place in Henry\u2019s army. For all his growth, though, Hook doesn\u2019t measure up to Richard Sharpe (who\u2019s basically James Bond with a musket\u2014less dynamic than Hook, but more fun to read). Agincourt\u2019s battles are the equal of anything in the Sharpe series, however, and Cornwell weaves in frank appraisals of late-medieval Christianity and the general brutality of the age. Overall, the book struck me as something of a guilty pleasure; I imagine Cornwell\u2019s audience is largely male. But you could do far worse if you want to learn how to write a stirring fight scene. ...more I have not enjoyed Cornwell's book before. I had tried the Saxon Chronicles and hated it.

Plot As the title suggests the Plot is mainly about the English invasion of France and the triumphant battle of Azincourt. The story actually starts about a year before the battle and eventually leads up to it, trying to cover the months in between by giving us an account of events through Hook's eyes. For the most part it is an English PoV except for a few pages where the French perspective is shown. The story was quite entertaining and straight forward. However the author used a supernatural angle as well in the plot (Most likely a hallucination) which I did not like. Characters Hook, the English Archer is the main protagonist of the book and for the most part, he is uninspiring. I felt there should have been more to hook that what was shown. I know nothing about Henry V so I can't say if his characterisation was historically accurate. Melisande, the only female character in the book gets little in terms of growth and is used for a cliched ending. Sir John no doubt is the favourite of many readers. Narration Despite being English himself, Cornwell has not over glorified his country men in battle, a point which requires appreciation for standing out amidst over zealous patriotic writings of history. He does not bother to say who is wrong or who is right, but simply narrates a story which actually works in favour of the book as there is no clear way to say whose version is the correct one. Unlike the saxon stories, I did quite enjoy the speed in which the story moved and the way it didn't linger on every battle or situation. I must definitely try to pick up another Cornwell. Hopefully, soon. ...more", "Title": "Azincourt"},
