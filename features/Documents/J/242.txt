First things first: This almost never happens, but I have to admit that I cried at the end of this book; I clutched my cute little kitty-kat and bawled. However, I didn't cry because of what the book in general, necessarily, but because of what it did to me. It drags out your saddest memories and pains, kicking and screaming, makes you look them right in the face and watch them all happen all over again, no matter how much you don't want to. It effects you on the deepest levels and makes <+++>A Monster Calls</+++> really turn into what, I think, truly deserves the name of a novel. This book resonated with me so deeply on so many different levels; it's just astounding. My dad died suddenly, in a span of only thirty short minutes, of heart failure three years ago when I was just fifteen. Beneath all of the sadness from his passing, I've also been horribly mad. I never got the opportunity to even see him alive even once on that Tuesday, to let my monster come walking and hold me up with its monstrous hands as I said the words I didn't think I'd ever have the bravery to utter. All of the little things that you thought would be indelible really can go away, just in the last couple of months I can't remember what my dad's voice sounds like anymore, and every time I look in the mirror, I see my dad; it's a blessing and a curse to look just like him. So for these three long years I've lied to myself; saying things like \"it was his time\" and \"there was nothing I could do to stop it\" all of those things that people want you to say and expect to hear after the death of a loved one. But, after this book, I, like Conor, realize that I didn't want him to go, dammit. He was my dad; the guy that got up every morning early just to tell me that he loved me. He was my confidante, my every Tuesday night ice cream sandwich \"date\", my Trekkie, my best friend. And I learned from <+++>A Monster Calls</+++> that it's okay to be selfish like that, because you need to be able to say that you want to hold onto the people you love most before you can truly let go. I'm not saying that the change for me will be immediate, but this amazing novel by <---A>Patrick Ness</---A> showed me that it really is okay. That, right there, is one of the best things that a novel can do, to truly be able to affect a person to a core. And that's what A Monster Calls did to me in more ways than one. I could also relate to Conor's feelings of being alone, ignored, and being treated \"specially\" just because of circumstance. Not only were the stares practically unbearable, but it reminded me every day of what I'd lost. You begin to shrink inside yourself in order to avoid it all, and, at the time, you want to become unseen to your fellow classmates; because being invisible is better than the stares, the pity, the concern. Whether your loved one has passed or it's imminent, you still don't want to believe that it's actually going to happen or has happened. No matter how much you've said the total opposite to yourself and everyone else; there's still a small part of you that thinks they're just been on vacation and are going to walk through that door, wrap you in a hug, and tell you how much they missed you while they were gone. Those stares just diminish that little shred of hope that you've got, so Conor and people like myself react by shutting off. Again, like I and Conor learned, once you're shut off, it sucks.<---F> Big time</---F>. I'm one of those kind of people that is more an introvert than extrovert when it comes to emotional pain. When my dad died, though, I broke. I cried for a solid hour, and even when I was able to stop myself, the total shaking of my body didn't stop. I can remember everything that night through those shakes, my little sister screaming, my mom calling and asking in garbled speech if I wanted to see my dad's body one more time before the funeral. But I couldn't do that. I couldn't go. Couldn't accept that he was actually gone. The shakes didn't stop until I finally fell asleep on my dad's side of the bed hours later. I only really cried hard one other time after that, a day before my dad's funeral, but since then, I hated myself for it. For being weak and crying when my mom and sisters were needing someone so desparetly to help them. I haven't cried like that since then, and for a whole year I tried to fill the space my dad left. It was useless, but I tried: I made the meals, cleaned the house, mowed the lawn, did all that I could to ease their pain and worries while only tending to my own late at night, silently crying into my pillow. What Ness showed me through Conor was that it's okay to cry while others are watching, to let them take care of me and what I've dealt with, for three long, and yet, at the same time, short three years. A Monster Calls was able to let me take some of the pressure and pain out of that bottle of pent-up emotions and sadness, and I can't thank Patrick Ness and Siobahn Dowd enough for doing that for me through Connor. And I loved all of the stories that the monster-although I don't really think of him as a monster anymore which I think is part of the irony of A Monster Calls- told. Even to the third and final story you really don't know how it's going to end and what the moral (<---B>or, possibly, no moral at all</---B>) is of each one. And they're not just a bunch of random stories that have no meaning to the plot. They literally are the plot. It's what drives the whole story and gives Connor the dimensions beyond just a little boy grieving his dying mother. It gives the shading of a character that helps us as readers see his drive and purpose for doing all that he is doing, which you just don't find very often these days. I wouldn't have been able to relate Conor's feelings of loss and pain without them, and that would have been a total shame. Can I just say that I absolutely loved the monster, because I did. He, or it, or whatever, was just such an amazing character. His cryptic answers, interesting stories, the ability to discern what is true and what isn't, and was there for Connor when he needed him to be really made him feel like a god, or; at least, how a god should be. At first, in the beginning of the book, when he started declaring about his \"many names\" and how awesome, powerful, and ageless he was, I thought, oh, here we go again, another mightier-than-thou, idiotic deity, but Ness's monster talks the talk, and walks the walk superbly and graciously. I will never forget about the monster made of an ancient Yew tree. Maybe someday, when I'm ready, or even totally unprepared, my monster will finally come walking, and I sincerely hope for that day. The writing for the story was perfect. It had just the right amount of lyrical prose, a pubescent teen's voice, and an adult enough sounding idea and story that it will keep practically anyone 13+ entertained and effected for the rest of their lives in the best way possible. I basically loved everything about this book. What I'm about to say next is not a joke. It's freaking weird, but not a joke: After I was finished with this book and sitting in my contemplative and teary-eyed silence, my mom, not even five minutes later, walked up and told me something totally shocking, knowing nothing of the book and what I'd just read. She told us that our close neighbors's daughter-who has two kids- was diagnosed with severe uterine cancer, and that the prognosis for her survival was not good. I was totally astounded at the coincidence and meaning of it all. The feelings that went through me at this point are really hard to describe, but it really goes to show that you never know when it's going to happen, and you need to be able to start the process of letting go at any time, because you never really know when yours and anyone you love's time is going to be up. It was like an extra slap to the face after reading this book about how cruel-and sad- life can really be, sometimes. If I have to make any request to anyone from reading this review, it's to, please, never regret a single moment, and make every single one precious. In the end I would recommend this book with all of my heart to anyone and everyone. It is touching, poignant, and amazing. You absolutely do not want to miss out on this read. ...more Please excuse my ramblings, I read A Monster Calls in three hours and I am still extremely emotional.

I thought A Monster Calls was pretty much amazing in every way; from it's darkly beautiful illustrations (worth buying a paper copy for) I got back to my apartment in Bulgaria and thought I'd read a little bit of this novel before I went to bed. 2 hours later I was still sat in my original position but by this time I was sobbing my heart out.

I thought A Monster Calls was pretty much amazing in every way; from it's darkly beautiful illustrations (worth buying a paper copy for) to the great big touching metaphor that is the backbone of the story. Didn't like The Knife of Never Letting Go ? Not a problem. Forget it's by the same author whether you liked his previous books or not. Pretend you've never heard of Patrick Ness before because this is nothing like anything he has ever written. It's nothing like anything I've ever read. Where the Chaos Walking trilogy was a fast-paced adventure story, this is a very moving, well-written tale of a boy who's mum has cancer. It's about loss, and that doesn't necessarily mean death, and it's also about learning to let go and forgive yourself and others around you. Think you've got it? Think you've worked out that the 'monster' is going to be cancer itself? Think again. Like I said, this is a very different sort of idea (credit to the late Siobhan Dowd) and not the kind of book where you can guess where it's going. It's odd and unpredictable and very sad. Conor is one of those tragic but believable characters that you feel for all the way through. He faces constant battles in every aspect of his life. There's the obvious problem of his mother's illness, but also the fact that his dad has moved to America to start a new life with his new wife and baby. School offers no escape from Conor's miserable reality either as he finds himself between bullies who pick on him because they can and teachers who make their pity obvious every time they talk to him. Then one night a monster visits Conor. A dream? An ancient creature that appears to those in need? Anything is possible, none of which is important. This monster is here for one purpose... to tell Conor three stories in exchange for the truth. Conor begins to learn that things aren't always as they seem and right and wrong are not so easily defined. I loved it. It was nothing that I expected but I hope Siobhan Dowd's idea will inspire Patrick Ness to write more like this. ...more In the dark of night, when the house is still, what fears creep into your heart?

Conor's nightmares begin shortly after his mother starts her treatments for In the dark of night, when the house is still, what fears creep into your heart? For Conor O'Malley, his nightmares take the shape of a very old and very dangerous monster who visits him every night at seven minutes past midnight. He's half-convinced that these must be dreams of his fevered mind. But how can they be, when the visits are so vivid and when he finds physical evidence of the monster's existence the next day? Conor's nightmares begin shortly after his mother starts her treatments for cancer. He's also dealing with a father who lives far away and is engrossed with his new family, a brisk and determined grandma who doesn't understand him, and schoolmates who don't seem to see him anymore. As readers learn more and more about Conor's story and the terrible monster who comes to visit, it is impossible not to feel worry and fear and sadness for this boy, whose must shoulder problems that have toppled many adults before him. But even in his anger and pain, Conor's defiant spirit shows flashes of dry humor and painful hopefulness that are difficult to witness, but make him impossibly endearing. A Monster Calls is a middle grade children's book, but it's a children's book in the way that Roald Dahl or Shel Silverstein wrote children's books--that is, the surface stories are certainly well-written and compelling, but underneath that are the themes of confusion and loneliness and sadness that elevate them to timeless works of literature. And while A Monster Calls chooses to confront its demons more literally than some other books may, it does so with such fierce intelligence and ease that it never feels didactic or forced. ...the fire in Conor's chest suddenly blazed, suddenly burned like it would eat him alive. It was the truth, he knew it was. A moan started in his throat, a moan that rose into a cry and then a loud wordless yell and he opened his mouth and the fire came blazing out to consume everything, bursting over the blackness, over the yew tree, too, setting it ablaze along with the rest of the world... This an incredible book about the enormous burdens of responsibility and grief and loss. I read most of it with anxiety in my heart and as the story intensified, the ache in my throat got worse and worse. By the time I reached the end, hot tears were dripping onto the last two pages, and continued to fall as I immediately read those pages again, and as I read them yet again. But more than anything else, I felt a great deal of love as I was reading this. Love for Conor, love for his mum, love for his grandma, and love for everyone who has ever experienced a profound loss. This is such a beautiful book, such an important book, and one that I think so many children and so many adults will appreciate. I cannot imagine that there will be another children's book written this year that will provide such a moving and emotionally truthful experience, or one that will so easily become an instant classic. In just 215 pages, A Monster Calls shatters your heart and then wraps it up tightly again so that you can go and be present in the world as an infinitely wiser, more loving human being. About the Illustrations: The words themselves are powerful and full of terrible beauty and latent emotion. But if you're able, do try to get your hands on a copy of the hardcover, which is illustrated with wildly expressive artistry that complement the story perfectly and captures exactly the right feel for the book. I've included some of the illustrations from the book here in this review, but if you'd like to see more images, please visit Jim Kay's website to learn more about the process the artist used. About the Story: The story behind this book makes it even more poignant. Siobhan Dowd , the award-winning author of numerous young adult novels, conceived this idea and the characters and the beginning--but died of breast cancer at the age of 47 before she could write the novel. Patrick Ness was asked to write the book based on her idea, and he succeeded in achieving a work of fiction that both transcends its genre and painfully wrenches your heart. This review also appears in The Midnight Garden . An advance copy was provided by the publisher. [image error] [image error] ...more I just read this book from cover to cover. I have no idea how to rate it. It is the worst book I've read. I would never be able to recommend it, because I hated it. It's ripped my heart in two. It'll make you think of losing the one person who means the most to you. Or it'll make you think of those you've already lost. It's not a happy book, but it's an important one. Such a beautiful and gripping story. I feel like this is one of those books that will stay with you long after you've read it. this book is a perfect modern fairy tale. not a nice disney one with singing birds where everyone gets to go home with their prince and all of their limbs, but the older, darker kind involving foot-choppery and decimation. lemme step back a bit. i added this book to my to-read shelf the moment i saw its cover here on goodreads.com. i knew nothing about it except that something in me bellowed \"WANT!\" i did not win it in the firstreads giveaway (naturally) and as more and more people began writing r this book is a perfect modern fairy tale. not a nice disney one with singing birds where everyone gets to go home with their prince and all of their limbs, but the older, darker kind involving foot-choppery and decimation. lemme step back a bit. i added this book to my to-read shelf the moment i saw its cover here on goodreads.com. i knew nothing about it except that something in me bellowed \"WANT!\" i did not win it in the firstreads giveaway (naturally) and as more and more people began writing reviews for it, i discovered that it was not at all the kind of book i had thought (spooky horror), and was in fact something far more insidious and lasting. WHY AM I TELLING YOU ALL OF THIS? 1) this is how all my reviews are. welcome. 2) i am afraid of reviewing this book. it is tricky business, isn't it, sometimes? on the one hand, if i had not read other reviews on here, i would have gone into it thinking it was going to be a typical horror story. and who knows how i would have responded when i found out the actual tone of the book? but by not saying anything, who knows if this book will reach the correct audience? decisions are hard. i will say this: it is a beautiful book. and i mean that both in the book-as-object sense and in its contents. don't ever read this book on a device - you are missing half its power - a unicorn without its horn is just a horse, after all. this is a nearly-perfect book that every human should read. its treatment of the subject is incredibly sensitive, and conor is someone it is impossible not to feel for. although some of the specifics are limited to experiences in childhood, the majority of it has universal kick-in-the-heartedness. (i could not find an appropriate \"real\" word. that is all i have)it depicts helplessness and bravery and loss so very well. and it never feels manipulative, which is so rare in books like these. it only missed out on that fifth star because i was sure, after hearing other people's commentary, that is would make me cry. why do i have to be such a damn robot? but other than that, i cannot recommend this book highly enough. read it, write a better review than i have, and then gather your loved ones to you. ...more A Monster Calls has to be the most inventive book I've read this year.

I was in eighth grade in my English class, sitting under my desk in the back of the room reading A Walk to Remember . If you've read that book you will probably understand why I cried. I'm naturally an emotional person, you see. I cry easily if I see another's suffering. At the time I was fortunate enough to not have yet experience the feeling of losing someone close to you. Unfortunately, I know that feeling all too well now and that is the reason I was initially afraid to read A Monster Calls . I saw my GoodReads friends reading and reviewing the book, but I couldn't bring myself to add it to my shelf. I had an idea of where it could take me emotionally, and it's not a place I choose to visit. I keep those memories locked up and tucked away. But this book made me remember. It made me remember the phone call. It made me remember the shock, the pain, the regret, the denial, the limo ride, the funeral, the casket, the anger, the depression, the trials. It made me remember my brother, who on some days I choose to forget because it's easier that way. Maybe that sounds horrible, but it's true. It's an awful truth. So, how do you write a review for a book that makes you remember ? How can I describe in words how unbelievably vulnerable this book can make you feel? How do I explain the beauty of the frailty? I simply can't. My advice would be to go into this book blind. You have to or you risk doing a disservice to yourself, this book and the wonderful story within its pages. I suppose you are just going to have to trust me when I say A Monster Calls is beyond amazing. It's about loss, acceptance, grief, facing your fears, and letting go. This book made me laugh, made me think, tore out my heart, made me cry, and healed me. I hope, no, I know it will do the same for others...

I have a difficult relationship with books that deal with the subject of death and grief. Occasionally, I find a book that is moving and resonant - and I will both love it and feel jealous of it, for being able to articulate things I never could. Books that somehow translate raw emotion into words, that create a mirror out of ink and paper, reflecting back things I know to be deeply true and real (to me, at least). Then there are the books that make me feel like my emotions are being traded on, manipulated, cheapened. Reducing it to fuel for an angsty teen plot line. Presuming my tears can be bought for the cost of a $19.95 paperback. I can distinctly recall watching a film recently and walking out completely dry-eyed and practically spitting with rage at the distinct feeling that grief was being commercialised on. That such an incredibly personal experience and the accompanying emotions could be held to ransom by an overwrought, histrionic movie. Yes, I took it personally. Because it was personal. A couple of months before I turned fifteen, my father died. It was sudden, an accident. We\u2019d had dinner as usual. He was working nights and left soon after. I hadn\u2019t said goodbye to him because I was annoyed about something. Less than two hours later, he was dead. I could tell you exactly what clothes I put on after my brother told me I had to get out of the shower and get in the car. I could tell you exactly which Renoir print hung in the white, soulless room we were herded into at the hospital. I could tell you, word for word, the first thing my Mother said after we were given the news. What I can\u2019t tell you is what happened after that. Well, after a time, things came back into focus. But there is a great chasm in my mind that covers the rest of that night and the following days and weeks, as if my brain realised I couldn\u2019t bear it and filled that space in with darkness so I wouldn\u2019t see any of it. Now, it feels almost like a presence, something that has grown with me in a strange, symbiotic way over the years. Mostly, these days, it\u2019s a shadow, lying quiet and dormant, but making itself known by shading my memories, colouring the way I speak and act all this time later. At other times, it is a thick, solid wave, filling up my body so that I\u2019m afraid to speak, terrified that I might unleash a torrent I can\u2019t stop. That I might be overwhelmed, suffocated, drowned in sadness. I strongly believe that grief and death are deeply personal things that no one experiences in exactly the same manner. And I suppose that this is why some book and film interpretations make me so upset, that they somehow think they can package up the experience and present it to you, neat and orderly. \u201dHere is the sadness you ordered! Here are the steps you will pass through! You should cry.. wait for it\u2026now!\u201d The reality, I believe, is so much more complex than that. So, when people tried to reach out to me, touch me, say \u201cI know how you feel,\u201d \u2013 I wanted to lash out at them. To scream that they had no idea what I was feeling. All I wanted was silence. Someone close by, not to interpret my pain, but to bear witness to it along with me. A Monster Calls is many things - beautifully written and stunningly illustrated amongst others. But what struck me the most about this book is that it was so terribly honest. It bravely spoke of things that are often harboured in our deepest, darkest centres \u2013 far under the surface of our outward manifestations of pain. The things that are kept locked away by fear. Things that go unuttered because we worry that saying them aloud might make them real, and somehow define us in some horrible, irrevocable way. Although this book did make me cry at it\u2019s conclusion, I think in this case it was partly out of relief. The ideas expressed in this book, and very words uttered by the monster, allowed a weight to come sliding off my shoulders. I felt as if a personal truth had just been recognised and validated, in a very tender, respectful manner. Permission to accept that the thoughts I had pushed down as shameful and selfish, were just that: thoughts. Just one or two thoughts out of the millions I have had, but ones that I chose to hold on to and punish myself with for years. I have not read another book that expressed so much understanding of what this is like. I have not read another book that felt this empathetic \u2013 it doesn\u2019t just acknowledge your pain, it is a shared experience. A Monster Calls is a special book, one to be absorbed, internalised and held very, very tightly. I hope that it others are able to connect and love this book, to feel it leave an indelible print on them once the covers are closed. I know that I did. Again - apologies for the overly personal tangent this review took. But I'm afraid I simply couldn't find a way to write about this book without my own experiences seeping in. (If time lends me some objectivity, I might come back here and edit to make this a little more helpful.) ...more A Monster Calls did not constitute what I first visualized in term of story, plot and themes.

I\u2019m referring to emotions. Raw, vulnerable, intense and uncontrollable sentiments over which we, as human beings, scarcely hold control. Thirteen-year-old Conor tried to, though. He kept it all in: his indomitable worry for his mother\u2019s health, his hatred for his grandmother whom wanted to take him away from his beloved parent, his sadness at growing without a father and the solitude that he felt at school while being surrounded by people who showed pity, avoided Conor or bullied him\u2026every single day. But there was the monster too. Night after night, he visited Conor. He shared stories, thoughts and wiseness with this latter, in order to make him see things differently. But Conor was a stubborn! He heard, but he didn\u2019t listen. He didn\u2019t want to see the truth . He didn\u2019t want to see, acknowledge or tell this truth. In order for Conor to breathe peacefully again, he might have to do just that. I\u2019m being very brief and perhaps even confusing, unfortunately, but it\u2019s only because telling you more risks giving away too much. I had a surprisingly beautiful time discovering everything by myself and seeing how wrongly I foresaw the content to be made of. It was more than I expected. It was more than I even hoped for. As the majority of noticeable books being found on this planet though, A Monster Calls carried a weakness, especially characterization-wise. I sadly merely perceived any background on the characters, primary or secondary ones. There were some I strongly sensed the need to learn more about, especially Harry and Conor\u2019s grandmother\u2026and even a little more detail would have satisfied my curiosity. I felt certain of being in a reading slump, before I picked this marvel up. So I hope you will give it a chance too and let it fully stagger you. I cannot assure you that no tears of yours will be shed, but I surmise you will not wish to stop reading. ...more This is great book!

However, one can't deny that the author made this story thinking in kids and/or early teenagers, but not matter that, I think that readers of any age can enjoy this story with the same impact and purpose. As C.S. Lewis said (and I am quoting not necessarily with the exact words) \"that any children's story that it can't be enjoy by adults, it's a bad children's story\". NOT SO SIMPLE AS GOOD OR BAD For readers who are looking for stories where there aren't good people or bad people but just people, this is your book. This story will provoke you many moods and states, you will smile at some moment, you will hate at other, you will cry in yet another. And all that it's okay. I think that this book should be to be read at some moment in your lives. Please, don't let that those labels of \"children\", etc... in the genres of the book keep you away of the book, not matter how young or how old you are. If you want to read this book, please do, you won't regret it. It's about something important. About something needed to be read. ...more Tears. Lots of them. BOOKTUBEATHON 2016 BOOK #7 Well I am a hot mess of emotions right now. This book was so good and so important. It handled grief so well and I just...I am emotional.

I'm crying because this book is my story. It's my family's story. It's my mom's story. A Monster Calls was a difficult book to read. I've seen many readers say they've cried because of the words written on these pages. But I've lived this book. My mother died of breast cancer two years ago at the age of 44. I lived the day when the doctors told my mom that she had breast cancer. I lived the day when I'd spend my 19th birthday visiting her on her hospital bed in the ICU while she was in a coma. I lived the day when I would see her take her last breath. I lived the day I let her go even if it was the hardest thing I ever had to do. Two years later, I wish I could tell you that it gets easier. I don't cry everyday anymore if that counts as getting easier. I'm not sure why I'm even saying all this, but I guess reading this book has made me feel a bit vulnerable at the moment. It's made me confront all kinds of emotions I've been trying to avoid since the day my mother passed. Although I was reading this book through Connor's eyes, it was like reliving the tough year my family had to endure together while my mom fought the battle of her life. I've felt every emotion that Connor experienced. I hated being pitied. I was angry. At myself. At the world. At God. And when his mother spoke, it was my mother speaking to me through her words. A Monster Calls was a painful book. There were times when I even had to put this book down to compose myself. But reading it felt a lot like... closure. It reminded me that it was okay to be angry. It was okay to hurt, to be scared. It was okay to let go. A Monster Calls wasn't a book that I would typically read, but I'm glad I did. I was putting it off for a while because I was trying to avoid the feelings that it would conjure up but it's a tale I know that many people would love. It was a tough ride down memory lane but my mom's battle with cancer was not always bad. Sure, there were bad days and even worse days. But it brought us together as a family. I was closer to my mom in the 11 months she battled cancer than I did those 19 years of my life. Reading this book brought back a lot of painful feelings but it gave me a chance to, somehow in some way, say goodbye to her once again. 03.27.1970 - 07.25.2014 <3 ...more Oh boy. I picked this one up on a whim today as it's been sitting on my shelf for ages and I was in the mood for a good cry, seeing as our pending move is getting extremely close. This book brought me back to 2008 when my mom was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer, then after 3 months turned to stage 4 with a death sentence.

As any reader of Cormac McCarthy knows, sometimes the best ending is not the one that leaves us all warm and fuzzy. Patrick Ness\u2019s 2011 short novel was based on a concept from Siobhan Dowd, who died of cancer in 2007 at the age of 47, way way too soon. In this young adult novel (but also for the rest of us) young Conor O\u2019Malley is dealing with the terminal illness of his single mother. As if that is not bad enough, he\u2019s getting picked on at school. Then a monster \u201ccomes walking\u201d and things get interesting. Ness keeps the syrup on the table but tells this somber fantasy straight and it works. The characterization is real and the dialogue is what you expect in real life. The drawing of the monster was also excellent, casting from ancient myth, legend and from psychological elements to create a fantastic but believable relationship between Conor and the monster who always shows up at the same time. Highly recommended but keep the tissue paper in reach. ...more I don't believe that you can ever learn everything from a single story.

It's about the small things like making cereal for yourself in the morning and feeling the crunch of leaves under your feet. It's about the big things like losing battles, gaining friendships, getting lost in imagination, and finding yourself in the world. It's about the bigger things like the disappointed look in the eyes of someone you've hurt or the loving look in the eyes of the person who loves you more than anything else. It's about the biggest things like the hopes and fears you have for yourself and, more importantly, for those you love most in all the world.

I loved this book. I loved it. It is absolutely now one of my \"all-time favourites\". Here's why: 1) The illustrations: The artwork in this book is BEAUTIFUL. It isn't all hand drawn, which I actually really liked because each piece of art felt like a textured creation with use of graphics and different artistic techniques. The drawings are super powerful and dark and alongside the text, they give the book a terrible and terrific sense of foreboding and unease. 2) The poetry of the writing: I'll tell you right now, I don't like poetry. I don't dig it. But that doesn't mean that I don't appreciate beautiful and poetic writing, and this book definitely had that. The writing was gorgeous and rich and it made me feel like I was reading a delicious pastry. (I used a metaphor just now, and I stand by it.) 3) The monster: The monster in this book has officially become one of my favourite characters of ever. He is so intelligent and kind and powerful and beautiful and loving and mean and ilovehim. 4) Conor: I just wanted to hug him. I just wanted to let him know that I loved him. My favourite kind of main characters are the ones that I want to hold hands with, and Conor falls into that category. 5) The subject matter: This was a SAD book, people, a very sad book. I don't like reading things that are tragic just for the sake being tragic, but this had a larger purpose, I felt. I loved this book. I recommend it to everyone. You should read it.

It's like what Neil Gaiman tries to do with fantasy on a whole nother level mixed with John Green's tear-jerking coming-of-age stuff. It's short and there aren't any wasted words or pages. It begins and ends beautifully with fantastic stories within the story. I'm so glad a ran across this thing and took the time to read it. It tackles some pretty heavy issues in a unique way, and it's something I feel like I'll be thinking about for a while. Patrick Ness, man. He owns YA fiction in my opinion. ...more \u201cThere is not always a good guy. Nor is there always a bad one. Most people are somewhere in between.\u201d Ok !

After watching the movie this week (I was crying until the lady sitting next to me gave me paper handkerchiefs), my perspective on this book was changed irrevocably. A Monster Calls is not a children's book because it's dark, emotional and deep. I want to say that this was just a light read for me, but I can't. This book was gripping, yet it screwed my mind and my life completely after I finished it. \u201cI wish I had a hundred years, she said, very quietly. A hundred years I could give to you.\u201d A Monster Calls is not just a book, it's more than that, it thought me something about growing up and losing someone. \u201cConor was no longer invisible. They all saw him now. But he was further away than ever.\u201d Conor is just a child. He is bullied at school and carries the whole world on his shoulders all the time. His feelings towards everything in this book was palpable for me, when he is with his mom, I wanted to cry because I knew something would happen. Conor wants to save his mom even if it's unlikely to do that for a child at his age. So when the Monster comes, my brain worked so hard for the first two stories and my heart cracked for the thrid and the fourth stories. What happened after that was one hell of an emotion, I cried and cried and cried and didn't know how to stop crying. My body felt. My heart broke. My eyes hurt. How could this be possible ? Just a book, and it tore me apart easily with words. Those sensible words, I could feel it all. \"Conor could feel the monster close behind him, knew that it was kneeling, knew that it was putting its face up to his ear to whisper into in, to tell him the rest of the story. He called, it said for a monster.\" Patrick Ness is such a talented author. Every moment I spent for this book, I never regret it. https://goo.gl/bfBKh1 ...more", "Title": "A Monster Calls"},
