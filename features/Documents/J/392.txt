{"Comments": "Mr. Powers, I have no doubt in your ability to write the sappiest story ever. Not only do you manage to force a sister-brother bond over whooping cranes and frost, you also manage to force a shameful-but-safe romance between said sister and said brother's successful counterpart.<---F> I hate you</---F>. Thanks to you I will never like a crane, I will never sympathize with head trauma victims, and I will never finish your dumb book. You may have fooled Oprah, but I've got your number! \"The issue of subjectivity is a hotly debated topic in the fields of philosophy and the cognitive sciences. But is subjectivity necessary at all?

But is subjectivity necessary at all? Why is it not just enough to see and react, as a robot might do? What advantage is conferred on the organism by actually experiencing something over just doing it? It is important to consider that animals may not have subjectivity but only react as if they do. Some in this field point out that because we cannot determine that animals do have subjective feelings (qualia), we can say that in fact they don't until it is demonstrated otherwise. It may be argued, however, that the burden of proof is on those who deny subjectivity in animals. For myself, I suspect that subjectivity is what the nervous system is all about, even at the most primitive levels of evolution. As an obvious corollary to that suspicion, I also suspect that consciousness as the substrate for subjectivity does not exist outside the realm of nervous system function or its nonbiological equivalent, if there is any.\" -Rodolfo Llin\u00e1s- This quote is taken from Llin\u00e1s' fascinating I of the Vortex ; more specifically from a chapter on the concept of the self in relation to the human mind, and how this human pretense can be explained through physical states and activity in the brain. In his utterly fascinating exploration of brain plasticity and the way that neuronal signaling almost seems to communicate with various external environments to create physical movement, Llin\u00e1s focuses on the perplexing psychological obsession that human beings have with the concept of an I, me, or a self. This preoccupation informs most of the troubling debates about the nature of consciousness,<---M> most importantly</---M>, the paradoxical notion of how a thinking self could ever objectively reflect on its own various mental states. Is matter responsible for the stuff of thought? Is there a ghost in the machine? These are all very complicated questions, even for someone such as Llin\u00e1s, the preeminent neuroscientist of the twentieth century. Now, take a second to consider the passage listed above, and a few more to consider the basic question of \"selfness\" or subjectivity. <+++>The Echo Maker</+++> by <---A>Richard Powers</---A> is a story almost predicated on this theoretical concern; one so central to the aims of neuroscience. Or even consider Capgras Syndrome, which is what Mark Schluter, the main character of the story, is inflicted with after a terrible and mysterious automobile accident. To paraphrase this interesting neurological complication; basically the patient becomes incapable of emotionally registering the faces or physical presence of loved ones. It's a strange form of agnosia, and while the person still retains all of their previous memories, just as lucidly as anyone else, they do not recognize close relatives. It's been suggested by a number of neuroscientists, such as V.S. Ramachandran, that because the brain is incapable of registering the faces of loved ones, it attempts to logically acknowledge their presence as that of an impostor or double. As Mark struggles with with this delusion, one brought on by a physical brain state (usually damage to the prefrontal cortex), a number of characters, the first and foremost being his sister, Karin, Powers meditates on how human beings deal with the suggestion that they are merely physical mechanisms responding in kind to the biological sublimity of the natural world. To be fair, there is much more going on in Powers' book ... on a cultural level anyway. It's set in Kearney, Nebraska, which is clearly intentional on the authors' part. Powers is from Illinois, and he critically takes on this particularly barren midwestern landscape and culture with the voice of one who ostensibly resents it to some degree. Mark Schluter is sort of a redneck archetype who's as misunderstood as Bart Simpson. He's a relatively bright man, albeit something of a stubborn American cliche. There is a certain sensitivity to his character, but at the same time, Powers presents him (all of this after the accident of course) as something of a shit-kicking, Natural Ice slurping, Nascar fan. His friends Duane and Rupp, who may have had something to do with the accident, are even worse, something of an excuse for the degenerate path that Mark has chosen in life. His sister moved away from Kearney with the explicit intention of removing herself from these types of people, and pursuing a middle-upper class lifestyle, far away from the religious zealotry and backwoods paranoia of people like her mother and father. Now she must return because she is the only person that can take care of Mark. Of course, the problem is that he can't recognize her, and he believes that she is an actress who has temporarily taken the real Karin's place. In many ways, it's really an incredible utilization of such a neurological disease as a paradoxical emotional ballast to the rest of the story. As Karin tries desperately to rehabilitate her brother back to normal, she enlists the support of a few old friends and a few outsiders. It's at this point that she revisits her old fling, Daniel, a local ecoterrorist-type who works at the bird sanctuary, and was alienated by both Karin and Mark in the past. At one point he does some research on Capgras and offers her a book by an Oliver Sacksesque neuropsychologist by the name of Gerald Weber. The main focus of Weber's work as a neuropsychologist, as well as a writer of popular science books, was Capgras delusion. A man who is plagued by the thought that his work in the popular science writing industry is negatively affecting his true calling as a brain scientist, Weber initially feels over and done with exploiting case histories as fodder for publication material, but he is truly compelled when he discovers the rarity of Mark's case, as he has Capgras which was caused by closed-head trauma. So he flies out to Nebraska, eventually incapable of helping due to the crippling amount of insecurity he has developed from negative book reviews, about how much of a scientific hack he has become. If Weber's character, or Mark's for that matter, don't come across as big enough symbolical stereotypes of specific kinds of narrowly defined people, then they most certainly do in a roundabout way after Powers has introduced all them. Especially as Karin reconnects with Robert Karsh (who she had left Daniel for as a teenager) and duplicitously sleeps with both men, all the while helping wage a war between the earnest idealism of Daniel and nature conservancies and the cold, progress-motivated force of Karsh and his development team. Even Karin, to a certain degree, could be seen as the sort of woman who - because she felt so alienated by her peers growing up - did everything in her power to escape the stultifying ignorance of her midwestern roots. The characters all seem like such mindless puppets, controlled by the whims of Powers' banal imagination and what he thinks their \"type\" should be doing within the story. What's strange about <+++>The Echo Maker</+++> is that regardless of how solidly the narrative moves along, it's bogged down by various narrative techniques that just muddle up an otherwise simple story about a woman who is basically struggling to come to terms with the idea that the brain is a physical organ, merely responding in its damaged state. It's likely that her brother may never recognize her again, and after throwing her current lifestyle away for the sake of her brother, she'll be left with the realization that all of her efforts are in vain. Powers uses a lot of, what's been referred to as double voicing, a narrative technique in which a third-person narrator describes the mental state of the character in question, in a language that suggests that particular characters' style of thinking and speaking. Keep in mind, that Powers also has numerous philosophical reflections to make on the nature of the self, as well as the various mysteries of human consciousness. It's in this way that the narrative lurches along with a lot of cognitive science-oriented discussions of physical brain states and how these influence the way in which people think and act. When he's double voicing for Weber in particular, the narrative drones on like a bland version of Ramachandran's A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness , or some incredibly dull introduction to neuroscience. While The Echo Maker contains a handful of profound moments of human beings struggling with the natural mystery of their own brains, and what they think makes them individualistic or special, it fails to deliver well on a story imbued with so much dense technical knowledge. Every explanation makes certain parts of the book read like non-fiction, which certainly isn't a good thing considering what Powers seems to be attempting to accomplish. More importantly, the probing questions about the nature of consciousness, and the abstract meditations on the ecosystems of Cranes, their brains, human brains, and the boorish march of progress that Powers seems to think that human beings are so notorious for, just overwhelm the book. Add to all of this, characters that are insufferable after ten or twenty pages, and all you have left is a really neat premise that gets carried away with its own ponderous lack of limits. ...more Flowers for Algernon for the new millennium!!!!!

Of course, I was helplessly distracted the entire time by the Man Behind the Curtain. Does Richard Powers do all his own research? Where does Richard Powers live? Does he live in New York? Did Richard Powers haunt the neuroscience journal stacks of Columbia for two years while putting together this book? Because that is kind of what I was picturing. Also, for those who do not already know this, Richard Powers DOES NOT TYPE his novels. He hasn't in years. No, Richard Powers DICTATES his novels, using VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE!!! How can I POSSIBLY focus on what's going on in the novel, when I'm grappling with an image of THAT the whole time??? None of this is meant to imply that The Echo Maker is not engaging and absorbing fiction, because it definitely is. It is just not quite as engaging and absorbing as the idea of Richard Powers. But let's face it, that's some stiff competition. Does Richard Powers *really* know everything? Is Richard Powers a happy man? Is Richard Powers Richard Powers's real name? Does Richard Powers have children? Does Richard Powers have a dog? Does he love his dog? Does he love it more than he loves the children? Does Richard Powers really have the capacity to love, or is this somehow unusually difficult for him? Does Richard Powers feel smarter than everyone else? Does he feel smarter than his characters? If he really does know everything, it must be strange to write about people who do not. Can he empathize with them? Does he pity them? Or is he.... strangely, powerfully (!) jealous? Is it a great burden knowing everything? When Richard Powers was in elementary school, did some other kids call him a know-it-all? When he was younger, did Richard Powers smoke cigarettes? Has Richard Powers ever taken drugs? What are Richard Powers's friends like? Are they also famous writers? Is Richard Powers pleased when he is referred to as being a \"writer's writer,\" or do you suppose he sometimes wisfully dreams of being more of a \"reader's writer\"....? Reading The Echo Maker will not definitively answer any of these questions. But if you read carefully, I'm sure you will notice some pretty big clues. ...more Karin returns to her small town in Nebraska to care for her brother Mark, almost killed in a mysterious highway accident.

Kearny, Nebraska is a way station on the central flyway, a place where thousands of cranes congregate every year on their way north and south, providing an industry for the town. The descriptions of the migration are quite wonderful. Mark Schluter is a twenty-something who crashes his truck and barely survives, suffering extreme head trauma. Karin Schluter, his sister, leaves her job to try to help with his recovery. Mark cannot accept her as his sister, believing that she is a copy. Karin seeks help from the famous neurologist, Gerald Weber, who comes to Kearny for a look see. Gerald struggles to figure out just what is going in with Mark\u2019s brain. The case is very, very unusual. There is a wonderful aide, <---C>Barbara</---C>, at the nursing home where Mark recuperates. She seems exceptionally tuned in and eager to help. She has a talent everyone can see but a past that she keeps to herself. Daniel is the local head of an environmental protection group, and was Mark\u2019s best friend until they parted ways as teens. He also had a thing for Karin, and now Karin seeks his help for Mark. Powers is after existential prey here. What is the nature of consciousness? What is reality? Does it have external constancy or is all reality just what our brains make of available input? Is the sequence always cause then effect? It is an invigorating ride. Is it connection to others that gives us anchors to life, keeps the drifting balloons that are our conscious brains from floating entirely away? Along the way he offers us a few mysteries. Who is Barbara really? Why did Mark run off the road? Will the crane stopping point be saved? What will happen with Karin and Daniel? Will Mark ever return to his old self?

It's a burning, living, thoroughly modern idiom that most writers -- pale and sheltered one sees them -- have ignored, maybe even with some disdain. But on the other hand, Powers has always been a writer uncomfortable with emotion -- human interactions tend to feel robotic in his work. And he's terrible with endings. In The Echo Maker, Powers tries hard to bring humanity and the tiny horrors of intimacy into his work. Whatever success he has with this -- and there is some -- is entirely undermined by the shockingly bad, cliched, and embarrassing dialogue. Working class Midwesterners sound exactly as you'd expect them to sound -- in a sitcom. That is, in between standing in for Powers himself, when they sound as though the narrator has briefly entered the souls of his creation. It's a distraction, but not one without ironic reference to some of the book's themes: the physical mind under assault following a car wreck. Language, perception, relationships all fall under question. Characters struggle to articulate. Richard Powers struggles (and fails) to give their voices authenticity. ...more \u039e\u03b5\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9

When the Austin paper reviewed The Echo Maker prior to its release, I was intrigued and drawn to this author with an immediate urgency to read him. First I read the beautiful and opera-like The Time of our Singing and followed with the tender Galatea 2.2, two very different stories that demonstrate Powers' narrative alacrity. (Now add to that The Gold Bug Variations, which I plan on reviewing as an equally powerful novel. )Then I read The Echo Maker. Read the first few pages of the book. If you are not hooked, then this is not your type of literature. I was so swept up by his magnificently poetic description of the sandhill crane migration on the Platte River in Nebraska that I was compelled to study more about these birds on my own. The cranes are both a reflection of the story's concern of species preservation and are also allegorical, metaphorical. Powers' generous mind and renaissance intelligence weaves the story of the crane migration into issues of neuroscience and neuro-cognition as it soars into the mystery thriller plot of the story. This is a Pulitzer-worthy novel, perhpas too intelligent for what passes as Pulitzer these days. It is easily one of the best contemporary novels I have ever read, along with his books The Gold Bug Variations, Galatea 2.2, and The Time of our Singing. Add to that Infinite Jest, by David Foster Wallace; Blood Meridian, by Cormac McCarthy; One Hundred years of Solitude, by Gabriel Garcia-Marquez; The Counterlife, by Philip Roth; White Teeth, by Zadie Smith; Ada, or Ador, by Vladimir Nabokov; The Severed Head (or anything by this author), by Iris Murdoch; and Harlot's Ghost, by Norman Mailer. I am so driven to tell others to read this beautiful story that although I can not give the description it deserves, I must persuade readers to purchase it. It is a combination of naturalist concerns(the preservation of the cranes and the physical descriptions), neuro-science, dysfunctional family (with utter compassion and insight) and suspense thriller. Although there is an ethereal glow that swirls in every page, there is a definite, concrete and suspenseful plot. Powers has been compared to DeLillo; I agree only surfacely. Both are linguistically erudite and have dense meaning packed between words and thoughts, but DeLillo is more elliptical and ambiguous, while Powers has concrete fasteners to keep the plot driven. Additionally, he has more heart, the heart of Marcel Proust. It would be difficult to make a film of any of DeLillo's books I've read, but Powers has an immediacy, a muscular story that would transfer well to cinema (where of course they could ruin it if they made it too linear). The Editorial reviews reveal enough of the outline of the story; my intention is to tell readers just how profound is the experience of reading this novel. I was literally and literarily transported while reading and was engaged deeply by the third sentence. I am an RN that works in a neuro-psychiatric treatment center on an adolescent ward, so I usually avoid the subject matter in novels and look for different experiences; however, this story transcends the subject matter. Powers takes an aerial view of the life of an individual, the loneliness and solitude, while the characters strive to bridge the gap and explore the gap of connectedness. There is not one false note or sliver of self-consciousness in this exquisitely constructed story. Pathos without any treacly sentiment, startling science written poetically, and ancient rhythms humming all over. Powers has an amazing grasp of the utter incomprehensibility of time, and as in his previous novels, time is a major theme. I could read this story for the passages about time(and the cranes and the imagery) alone. However, there is a solid suspense mystery thriller, also, that keeps you on the edge even while you fall in love with the writing itself and go back and read passages just for its beauty. Mark Schluter suffers a closed-head injury after his truck veers off the road. He is then the first diagnosed case of Capgras syndrome sustained from injury rather than psychiatric etiology. Powers uses Capgras syndrome (the neurological disorder causing inability to recognize those closest to him while perceiving others accurately) to explore philosophical issues of memory, human fragility, and the vague recognition of the human brain. He delves into consciousness, reciprocity, the two-way valve between the head and the heart of the self, and the division between the human and the natural world. Powers' theme is dualism--familiar vs defamiliarization, and how that echoes in our perceptions of self and our relationship with our family and our environment, both personal and ecological. Mark feels exiled from his sister Karin, whom he no longer recognizes, and Karin in turn feels exiled from her brother, shattered at the way this disease symbolizes her separateness from her own self and the world around her. Powers' explorations of neurology and ecology render a chilly warmth to the story. His heart pumps clearly throughout the pages, and he bridges the (DeLillo)authorial distance by making accessible the burning concerns of everyman. The coldness of Nebraska and his virtuosity in geological and georgaphical descriptions is heated by the eerie passion of the story, the tenderness of the characters and the haunting allegorical presence of the cranes. This book has circulated through my dreams on several occasions; The Echo Maker certainly lives up to its title. Also, the characters are well drawn and sympathetic, and you care deeply about what happens to them. Interestingly, although the author's main protagonist in Galatea 2.2 was named Richard Powers, I felt him undulating enigmatically in this novel even more so than the former. There is something so powerful and reverberating and epic about The Echo Maker that you want to embrace the author, who you feel breathing and bleeding and searing through the most spiritual parts of your being. It is utterly and unassailably elegant, peerless, sublime, soulful, exalting, eternal, and yet grounded and accessible, palpable and wet. ...more SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT: I'm not giving away the ending here, but the following does give away some of the plot developments.

This won the National Book Award last year, and is by an author who has received one of the MacArthur \"genius awards.\" Did it deserve it? In the end, I can't endorse the choice, even though there is much to commend in this book. The basic story: a Nebraska factory worker flips his truck on a cold winter night, and when he wakes up, he believes that his sister has been swapped for a look-alike imposter -- a brain defect known as Capgras syndrome. That brings a famous Oliver Sacks-type cognitive scientist to the scene, where he encounters not only the patient and his nearly hysterical sister, but a nurse's aide who is far too savvy and knowing to seem to be in the right place. The book charts the long journey of the accident victim trying to make sense of his surreal world, and carries a couple relationship subplots along with it, along with a growing fight between preservationists who want to save the sand crane nesting area nearby and developers who have other plans. (The sections describing the sand cranes and their annual migrations are some of the most evocative in the book). The language and metaphors of the book are powerful and the mystery of how the man was injured is interesting to watch unfold, but the one other major subplot -- the public humiliation of the cognitive scientist after his latest book comes out -- simply didn't ring true. Not only did it seem unlikely he would be subjected to that kind of peer disdain, but his reaction to it and the unraveling of his marriage made no sense to me, and was a major flaw in the novel and one that held it back from being as meaningful or sweeping as it was meant to be. Too bad. ...more I couldn't finish this slow, overly descriptive, not-at-all intriguing, boring novel. It was a book-club pick and only two people finished it, one kicking and screaming.

Imagine what it would be like to think the person or people you love the most have been replaced by replica robots, aliens or government agents. On the flip side, imagine if someone you love thought you were an impostor. That would right and royally suck. And you know, the sister in the novel is pretty much a suck of a main character. Powers just dropped the ball on developing her beyond a whiny, scarred-from-childhood sot. He hints at why she's that way but he doesn't follows through (or maybe he does eventually, but I couldn't get there). So instead of finding her sympathetic, I eventually just wanted to punch her in the face. Anyway. Lots of novels are about extraordinary people. This novel is about ordinary people in an extraordinary circumstance during which neither the characters nor the writing lives up. I found the writing maddeningly self-indulgent. The prose simply isn't crafty, skilled or beautiful enough to warrant its quantity. The story concept is a good one, and the science is, as I said, fascinating. Unfortunately, the pacing just didn't do them justice. Save 400 pages of your time for another book \u2013 it's almost certain to be more enjoyable. ...more Mixed emotions as I finish this book.

This book is no exception to Powers' normal high standards. To be honest, I am tempted to give all his books (well, nearly all) 5 stars, but there has to be a way to identify the ones you really, really love as opposed to the ones you just really love. It all starts with a car accident when Mark Schluter ends up in a ditch. He comes out of a coma suffering from Capgras delusion: he believes that his sister isn't actually his sister but is a clever copy. And no one can persuade him otherwise. This forms the platform to launch into a story that investigates both identity and memory. What makes us human. Is there any coherence to it or is it just a random conglomeration? Oh, and cranes (the birds, not the machinery) are a central metaphor. Then, to add spice to the mix, we get a good old-fashioned mystery. Who wrote the note that Mark finds at his bedside in the hospital? Why were there three sets of tyre marks on the road at the scene of the accident? The comforting thing about reading Powers is that you know all your theories will be wrong and that he will come up with a far cleverer ending than you could imagine. And he does. This is perhaps one of the most accessible books Powers has written. Compared with, say, Operation Wandering Soul , it's a walk in the park. It doesn't pack quite the emotional punch of The Time of Our Singing which remains Powers' masterpiece as far as I am concerned, but it is a fascinating story that is expertly and beautifully told. I think all of Powers' books go straight on to my \"to be re-read\" list. ...more About half-way through this book, I grew so weary of its repetitious and academic tone that I checked out the Goodreads and Amazon reviews, wondering if my reaction to it was just me.

For some reason--stubbornness--I kept reading and ended up admiring the book. No, I don't think it didn't deserve the National Book Award, but there's mystery, keen and beautiful writing, and compelling speculation about the human mind and identity. As a birder, I loved the crane info too, tho I can see why it all the poetic images of them might seem blithering to many. Overall, the book fails. Powers fell prey after Gold Bug, I think, to a problem common to many phenomenally successful authors: His early brilliance intimidated his editors. They let him wander and detour and maunder on. They didn't keep him honest and true, didn't force him to put real life in his characters or think through his plot clearly. Powers' characters in this book--particularly Gerald Weber--are mere simulacra of real people. In Weber's case, this is a literal shortcoming, since Weber is based on the eminent neurologist Oliver Sacks. Neither Sacks nor his readers (Full disclosure: I love Sacks' books; his recent autobiography, Uncle Tungsten, is one of the finest I've read.) would recognize him here but for the rip-off of his appearance, his book titles and many of his case studies. If Powers had been doing the full work of imagining this character, Weber wouldn't be based on Sacks but inspired by him. Weber's head would be stuffed with human thoughts, not the cold substitutes Powers offers: case study after case study after case study. There was a great book lurking in the manuscript of The Echo Maker, but Powers' editors didn't bother to help him find it. Where's a brave editor when you need one? ...more This book was a gift from my brother who is a professor at the University of Nebraska.

The author was very clever to combine a medical and neuroscience drama with this natural phenomenon and I enjoyed the Nebraska references and descriptions immensely. However, I thought his portrayal of Nebraskans flat. He portrays people of the plains as simplistic and less nuanced then other enlightened Americans. There is much to recommend this book and the parts relating to the Cranes and their migration is the highlight. The plot and the medical science is also intriguing although, I have to admit, much of the psychological information was beyond me. I thought the environmental undertones were simplistic and I did not understand why everyone started cheating on everyone else; but I guess I am a simplistic Nebraskan prude. Even though the sex added nothing to the storyline and was distracting, I would still recommend this book. ...more I liked this book for its study of the human brain at different zoom levels; from the evolutionary scale of millions of years, our reptilian brain and deep-rooted animal instincts connecting us to the cranes, the intriguing species Powers has chosen to present his case.

The narratives intertwining observations about the cranes, the water ways, and the human relationship to them (at once primevally close and irreparably distant) are beautifully woven and provide plenty of thought-provoking material. A nice example, which I won't include because it may possibly be a plot spoiler, is at the end of pg. 416/ top of pg. 417. Powers zooms in on the brain at the system level -- \"unsponsored, impossible, near-omnipotent and infinitely fragile\", it forges a coherent picture of the self, completely unique to each individual (\"The man who had taught her than any life one came across was infinitely nuanced and irreproducible\"). Then he goes deeper, lifting the cover and exploring the subparts, and how amazingly the system continues to function when they are damaged. Yet another level down to the neurons, the coldly scientific chemical reactions (eg -- Bonnie's distress at reading about the God module and the belief switch) and then in a circle back to the origin of everything, the chemical spark which created life in a single cell. I found many fascinating topics in every level of this examination, from discussions about empathy and our connection to other people, to the deeply personal perception of ourselves, seemingly continuous and stable yet scattered, fragile and mind-bogglingly complex underneath the surface. The reason I didn't really like this book is because of the characters and their stories. I get the feeling that they are mere vessels for the subjects I described above. The siblings with a bad childhood, the selfless environmentalist, the jerk who the girl keeps running back to, the mystery woman with a secret -- all of these are sort of flat stereotypes one finds in many American films/books/TV shows. The 'damaged', highly emotional, self-absorbed characters are a contrast to the intricate observations made about the functioning of the brain and humans in general. I liked the story of Gerald Weber and his wife a little better, maybe because it felt a bit more real to me. Lastly, I find the style of writing too choppy -- I often had to reread sentences and almost struggle to string together the meaning in a paragraph. The presentation lacks subtlety and has an in-your-face quality that sort of matches the state of disarray the characters are going through, but which does not make for smooth, continuous reading. As a result, it took me quite a while to finish this book, and there are probably many things I missed (for example, I was oblivious to the whole The Wizard of Oz theme until I read it in the Wikipedia entry after finishing the book... however, perhaps this is probably due to my own mediocre powers of observation). I think the writing style, together with my feelings about the characters, made it feel a little bit like I was plodding through a gray story, from one gem section about cranes or neuroscience to another. However, I should note that I thought the way the story was presented, switching between the perspectives of the main characters, is masterfully done (in the sense that Powers captures his characters' voice well, even though I may not appreciate the characters themselves). To conclude -- I would recommend this book to someone who is interested in neuroscience and the study of the way our brain functions and perceives the 'self' (especially from a more anecdotal, artistic perspective, rather than a purely clinical one), and who appreciates the higher-level exploration of topics such as the human connection with other species (in this case, the cranes) and with the environment (in this case, the inevitable exploitation of the river which is the cranes' migratory route stop). To me, that is the real strength of this book, and the actual plot and characters pale in comparison. ...more Plot and formula won out over characters in this Powers effort.

How interesting that a person could have this focused paranoia, where he believes everything in the world save one person or thing, whom he believes to be an impostor? Now, to write the book, it seems that Powers researched the disorder and to prove it, he incarnated his research in Dr. Weber, a neuroscientist. It is apparent that Powers puts a solid amount of effort into the ideas and flirts with some of the philosophical questions, but I find the characters to be nearly one-dimensional. The sister shows signs of exasperation, but plods forward as if her choices have already been made. Semblance of regret seems unbelievable. Likewise, Weber and Mark go through the motions of the people they inhabit. The peripheral characters are even worse, with Weber's wife Sylvie, who is basically perfect, and Karin's sometime lover, who is an eco-friendly version of Sylvie. The dimension is broken a few times for the main players, but it is only in order to advance the plot. A character will suddenly make an unpredictable decision that goes against his or her past choices, in order to avoid showing Mark further proof that he has a disorder. When Powers explains why these choices are made, it sounds like sit-com hack, descending into etiquette games. Despite my frustration with the characters and predictable plot, Powers puts forth some good descriptions of the cranes and Nebraska town. It recreates the environment well, and his depictions of Mark's friends (though still somewhat one-dimensional) were believable. It's possible that my hopes were raised by the National Book Award and Pulitzer shortlisting, but in the end I found it to be a frustrating experience. ...more I\u2019m going to try a different approach to this.

A famous neurologist, Gerald Weber, arrives to see Mark so he can write about him in his next book. And some cranes fly through town on their way to Alaska. The main problem with the story is that Powers does nothing with the story. His characters are uninteresting to start with and are completely unbelievable. They don't react to situations, they overreact. Everything that happens is the most important thing that has ever happened and every character reacts that way. And Powers doesn't tell a story, too often he tells us about a story. For example, when Weber goes on a television show, we only find out that he embarrasses himself during the interview but not what he said that was so terrible that it destroyed sales of his book. Weber, a crucial character in the story, is the weakest written character in the book. It is virtually impossible to justify or understand his actions. And if two people have sex in the mud, don't you think they might want to shower or at least change their clothes before going off to lunch and then on to some tourist attraction? There are some good parts of the book. The mystery of the letter left at the hospital is interesting and is wrapped up quite nicely. In a clever and effective technique, Powers writes alternating sections from the point of view of the various characters. But the book would have been much better if Powers had reduced the length by about 200 pages. I found myself becoming bored with the characters and the story. Serious editing and the elimination of certain story threads could have kept the book short enough to make us not care that the characters are completely unlikeable and unbelievable. But at 450 pages, the holes in the characters shine through. ...more Alright, I'm convinced. Richard Powers is a rambler. He rambles, extensively, through characters, plot, images. On and on.

It doesn't mean you're stupid or I'm stupid or the person who legitimately liked this book is stupid -- it just means the book isn't a fucking masterpiece. Powers irritates me. I don't like feeling I have to make excuses for authors -- the work should stand on its own. But I can't get swept into Powers' works, nor do I find them particularly inspiring or innovative or interesting. They've got some stunning verbal beauty and some well-crafted moments, but not enough to prop up the flailing plot, opaque themes, and absurd characterization.

Other images are animals and birds as endangered or extinct species. We learn, nearly halfway into the book that the cranes hold strong metaphorical weight and they are indeed, the echo makers. The basic story is that of a young man who crashes his car on a deserted piece of road one wintry night and sustains a head injury. His sister, his only living relative, comes back home to care for him. But as he regains some of his powers of cognition, he fails to recognize the one indisputable fact of his life \u2013 that she is his sister. He thinks she is some kind of imposter and because of this she is emotionally shattered. She contacts a famous New York psychiatrist (loosely based on Oliver Saks) to study this unique and perplexing syndrome \u2013 Capgras Syndrome \u2013 and from this set-up, secrets are revealed. The story deftly moves from the perspective of Karin, Dr. Weber, and interestingly, Mark, the patient. Powers does this skillfully as he evokes the profound changes happening within the mind of Mark.

His delusions grow wilder, until he believes the entire town is a government-sponsored 'replacement' of his real house, neighborhood, etc. Frustrated, Karin calls on a famous neuroscietist, who comes to help but can't, and eventually succumbs to some emotional and mental health issue of his own. Karin finds herself stuck in Kearney, falling back into a disfunctional relationship with both her ex-boyfriend and the man she was cheating on him with. Oh, and there's a subplot about the migration of Sandhill Cranes, but I really have no idea where Powers was going with that. I'm sure there was some deep symbolic meaning in all the bird stuff, but I'd stopped caring before I could figure it out. I stuck through this because there was supposed to be some big payoff at the end - the mystery of the car crash revealed, etc. - but it really wasn't worth the excruciately slow hundreds of pages it took me to get there.

Which is good. I do think I like this book but I don't think I can articulate why yet because it requires at least another read--or at least it requires me to re-read it. Its themes (consciousness, perception, identity, reflection, the way the passage of time affects all) are grand, delivered through its characters, the cranes, their mythology, and neuroscience and the questions the field has come to introduce. I'd say it falls into the category of books that require a bit of work in order to totally grasp. There are events in the book I didn't care for upon the first read--Gerald Weber's behavior with Barbara, mainly because I don't understand what its purpose was--it seemed to be a strike of drama that didn't need to be there. Also, I was willing to accept Mark Schluter's miraculous comeback to his \"original\" self at the end because I've heard stories of something drastic setting aright brains that have turned upside-down. I didn't want a step-by-step sort of murder-mystery solution, but after all of the neuroscience that had been delivered up to that point, it seemed to me like cheating not to at least hint at how he may have recovered. One other thing that feels lopsided to me is the presence of mythology. When I began reading this book, a friend asked me if it had anything to do with Echo of Greek myth. I looked up the myth before I started reading the book and soon noticed the book had more to do with Native American mythology than Greek, but then there was a slew of myths listed part-way through (including the Greek Echo) and I thought I might find something after all, but then there was no further mention of these myths. Not that I want to be beaten over the head with it, but when I finished the book it was like that part never happened. Something I wondered about throughout was the neuroscience-speak. About a year ago I read 4 or 5 books in a row on various aspects of the brain--it's composition, function, disorders, philosophy, etc.--and I was working for a couple of neuroscience journals, so reading neuroscience research became normal reading. That said, I wondered throughout The Echo Maker if, had I not done all of that reading, all the neuroscientific passages might have been too heavy, might have read like excerpts of research papers sifted in and turned me off. Hard to say at this point, but it occurred to me. Things I think are impressive about the book: the dialogue is done well, especially for the characters in Mark's crew--sounds just like the banter of people I know who seem to be a lot like them. Also, I like the way that these grand ideas (that I'm not yet able to articulate) are demonstrated through the lives of characters who, in addition to dealing with the major trauma of Mark's accident and subsequent brain damage, are also normal people with childhoods, dysfunctional parents, money problems and the like. The fragility of the brain in the physical and--the more difficult to get at--consciousness are demonstrated on multiple levels--which is something I'd really like to explore more in the book. On top of it all, the plot is compelling and unfolds well. I needed to know what happened, even though, given the fragility of the brain and the way the passage of time affects memory and identity, I thought nothing could be solved for certain. Upon a first read I'm able to list things that disconcerted me or put me off more so than things that got my gears turning. However, all the way through I saw lines, snippets, and passages that needed underlining and piecing together when it was all through and brought along into a second read. On a bit of a schedule, I haven't done the piecing together yet. For now, though, I think I like this book but I don't think I can decide for sure to what degree until I've been able to spend more time with it and grasp it in full (or not). The plot is interesting enough and its ideas rich enough to get me to read it again, but life is busy, so I'll see about doing that. I do wonder if some of the elements that put me off might be part of the book's grander themes in action, meta-wise, which I'd be happy to accept if it all came together that way. I'm not so put off by these parts to weigh them heavier than what I think are the book's strong and compelling points. ...more I read this because a former professor of mine--a brilliant man--recommended the author in passing. The first hundred pages or so were interesting and set in motion a terrific idea for a novel. However, the book soon became unwieldy and horribly overwritten. Powers couldn't leave well enough alone. The dialogue between Weber and his wife is terrible-- who talks like this? --and many of the characters speak in cute ironic phrases. At one point, a woman tells Weber in a bar, \" Basta.

The dialogue between Weber and his wife is terrible-- who talks like this? --and many of the characters speak in cute ironic phrases. At one point, a woman tells Weber in a bar, \" Basta. Enough flagellation. Let's dance.\" Enough flagellation? At another point, one of the protagonist's friends-- a loser--quotes Hamlet. (And not \"To be or not to be,\" but something more obscure.) There are hundreds of such examples in the book-and the longer it goes, the more the characters all seem to sound like each other and the more difficult it became to turn the pages. Powers is too smart for his own good, or at least the good of the reader. He attempts to dramatize how the brain creates the illusion that we are whole when our selves are really fragments. But the amount of neuroscientific jargon that is found on so many pages becomes maddening. When a man kisses a woman and we read, \"He slips down into limbic back alleys, corners that survived when the massive neocortex came through like a superhighway,\" we realize that when you're holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Perhaps Powers writes about cranes better than people. As for the great mystery that propels the book, the payoff is completely underwhelming. Avoid. ...more", "Title": "The Echo Maker"},
