UNSCRUPULOUS. That's what The Manhattanites are, their lives are full of fame, fashion, glamour, and hard work. Just like the first part of this series, <+++>Unscrupulous</+++> can be best described as \"fun erotica\", with moments that will make you want to *fan yourself* and others that will leave you laughing uncontrollably. It reminded me of Sex and the City, but with a sexier edge to it. Unscrupulous is the second part of The Manhattanites series and tells the story of Taddy Brill, Lex Easton's best friend who already had a brief but memorable introduction in the first part of the series, Undressed . Although this is the second part of the series, this story can easily be read as a standalone. In my opinion, Unscrupulous had a very different vibe from Undressed and I ended up enjoying it even more than Lex's story! First, let me introduce you to the \"hero\" of the story: CEO Warner Truman , third richest man of the world. \"I used to strive to live my life for happiness, not money or status. I don't know what happened or why I stopped.\" Now, before you start thinking Warner must be another dominant, controlling billionaire like Christian Grey and Gideon Cross, I can assure you he's nothing like any of them. He doesn't have any dark secrets in his closet, hidden playrooms or other controlling tendencies. He's intelligent, charming and the perfect gentleman, but when he wants something, he's not afraid to go after it. ;-) You would think that with a swoonworthy hero like Warner, there would be no doubt about who my favorite character in the story would be, BUT with a heroine like Taddy that isn't exactly the case... \"It's not my intention to be a diva. It just happens. I wake up like I'm flippin' Beyonc\u00e9 or something.\" Taddy Brill is the CEO of Brill, Inc., New York's most elite and succesful public relations company. She's a self-made woman who strives every day to be the best at what she does. She's strong, determined, merciless and never afraid to speak her mind. She's a perfectionist, an obsessive masturbator and a workaholic all at the same time. Estranged from her family, her friends are as close to family as she has and with a busy schedule like hers, there isn't much time for love or relationships. \"I never meet men with any expectations other than having a good time. Then I 'm never disappointed.\" But then she meets Warner Truman . A man who has suffered loss and heartbreak in his past as well and who has decided to never again date a woman who's only after his money. Like Taddy, he's a self-made man and that's why he seems to have found a perfect match in her. Both of them know what it's like to built a career from the ground up, they're both powerful and succesful in their business and that creates an immediate bond between them. The chemistry between Warner and Taddy is off the charts hot and from the moment they first meet, there's an instant connection between them. As they start to get to know each other better, their feelings start to grow more and more, and they realize how perfectly they complement each other. But will they be able to admit their true feelings to both themselves and each other? \"I knew I was in love when I couldn't fall asleep because she was lying next to me.\" But will they be able to make it work? Will their busy scedules and past experiences allow them to open up their hearts and make themselves vulnerable? Aside from Taddy and Warner there were several side characters that made the story all the more colourful and fun to read like Kiki, Taddy's timid assistant, and Taddy's best friends Lex, Vive and Blake. Each one of them has their own unique personnality and the conversations between Taddy and her friends seriously made me laugh-out-loud quite a few times and I'm already looking forward to Vive and Blake's own story! ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ Overall, I think it's safe to say Unscrupulous is one of the funniest, most entertaining books I've read this year and I would highly recommend anyone looking for a sexy, unique read with a healthy dose of humor to give it a try! **ARC courtesy of Ellora's Cave via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review** ...more Gear up ladies because Warner is here to grab you by the ovaries!!

The writing was easy, but captivating and I didn\u2019t want to tear my eyes away from the magic *wink*. As fun and just all out fabulous these two characters were, they haven\u2019t had a perfectly paved out life. Taddy lived the high life as a child.

We own designer footwear in excess, overspend on vodka cocktails and work sunup to sundown. By accident love takes a backseat but we always find time for sex (wink).\" Taddy Brill is an uber successful Manhattanite, owning her own company with the help of her very gay, unhappily married friend Blake (can't wait for his book btw). Sorry to digress.... Taddy has close friendships with Lex and Vive, also very successful businesswomen. Their lives are about a lot of work, drinks, and singledom (is that a word?). Taddy has no functional family to speak of...being an emancipated minor, she's worked hard for where she is and her friends are her family. She's uber loyal and will do anything for them in times of need. Warner Truman is a widower, very private and doesn't date much since a betrayal of his ex fianc\u00e9e. He's the third richest man in the world and has worked hard for where he's at. When he runs into this stunning redhead at his St Barths resort, sparks fly. He hasn't felt this pull towards a woman in years.... They get acquainted over champagne talk. Taddy hasn't been told \"I love you\" ever in life. Not from parents, not from friends. Regardless of her profound loyalty, she's very guarded to accept any man's affections beyond sex. She's been rejected in the worst way as a child and those scars run deep. Warner sparks something in her she WANTS to pursue but can she take a chance with him? What did I love about this book, you say? The cast of characters, especially Taddy. She's got insecurity issues but she's a tough broad and doesn't wallow in self pity. Hallelujah to a strong heroine. She drops anything to aide her friends and dominates the business sector. What a breath of fresh air! Awesome! Loved Taddy! Then there's Warner, sexy beast that he is. Love, love, love that he's all alpha strong, successful, rich, and doesn't have a shit-ton of secrets in his closet.... Another common \"trait\" of late in erotic novels... Weak heroines, rich men with secrets. Nope, not here. It was refreshing to see a relationship with a fair share of baggage but both people approaching it maturely. Some of their antics and \"issues\" in bed were comical yet true to life. He's a talker....she's not. This book has serious laugh out loud moments. It wasn't forced, just flowed with the personality of this crew. It has a very Sex in the City feel to it. And we all know who Mr Big is in this book.... . Looking SO forward to Blake, Vive, and Sheldon's books! Hint hint. Sheldon....Warner's tattooed badboy little brother..swoon. Some of my favorite quotes..... Taddy getting a pedicure...... \"\u201cPlease do not masturbate while I do your feet. I cannot take another moaning horny white woman this week.\u201d Taddy- \"I'm a perfectionist. I'm also an obsessive masturbator, a workaholic, and I started smoking again. Taddy talking about when she had Mononucleosis- \"I had lymph nodes the size of grapefruits...and my enlarged spleen caused constant abdominal pain. My skin had gone jaundiced.\" So yellow she could've passed for Laa-Laa the yellow Teletubby. Thanks <---A>Avery Aster</---A> for the opportunity to read your brilliance and provide my HONEST review!

My god that man is hot!!! And their first encounter is scooooooooorching! Just naughty enough and I loved that he did not get bulldozed by alpha bitch like Red... because honestly sometimes us New Yorkers need a Big Daddy to calm our asses down and release the control just a TAD! With a heavy hand giving her the pleasure that any girl dreams of this HEA story is amazing... fast paced, dirty to the point of raunchy, but sooo full of heart and TLC. \"I can also tell you haven't experienced love. Not in a long time - if ever.\" \"No, you're right.\" \"You deserve to be loved. Please let me show you.\" He drew her face to his and kissed her. \"I'll show you if you let me.\" Applause to you Miss? Mrs? Miz? Mademoiselle? Avery!!!...

The characters had nothing to do with, well not completely anyway. It started out really slow for me. That I almost DNF it. But I continued in hopes it would get better. I got Taddy Brill's sad upbringing made her into the person she now is, but in the beginning, Taddy was a bit annoying . The whole first part of the book was about her wanting this guy's cock and this other guy's cock, pretty much anyone would do, she was that desperate. I was getting overwhelmed with her obsession with sex. So that was the pretty much the first part of the book. I was waiting for a relationship to develop, and all that happened was she met Warner Truman aka \"Big Daddy\" and it was insta love . They didn't end up sleeping together that night due to someone showing up. I found it a bit hard to believe how quickly their feelings for each other were growing. Especially after not seeing each other for months , but still, they were hung up on that one brief encounter. Finally it starts going somewhere when around 60% , Taddy and Warner meet again. This is when my interest was peaked. The sex was hot and all, but I still was unable to connect with characters. I did love that Warner pushed Taddy's limits and showed her what love is, even if that love developed too fast. Warner was hot , sweet , and swoony . I liked him a lot, I think he was the most interesting character in this book. His back story was also a sad one. He was afraid to love but he took a chance on Taddy. Taddy was a lot better in the second half of the book, again thanks to Big Daddy. The ending was good , but it fell a bit flat for me. I really think that there wasn't enough of chance for the connection that Taddy and Warner shared to flourish . Had there been more of the relationship from the start, I would have enjoyed it more. I wish I could have liked it more, I really tried but I guess it just wasn't for me. It seems some of my GR friends have enjoyed it. So, who knows, you may like it better than I did. ...more Well this is a conundrum if I've ever been in one... Let's see if I can talk my way through figuring out a star rating... So being completely honest, I would say through the first 55% of this book or so I just felt kind of... I thought it was well written. There were some funny aspects to it, but I also felt like at times that Taddy was a bit too much. I got her character and later on it made sense why she was so brazen and obsessed with orgasms, masturbation, and fucking anything with a penis Well this is a conundrum if I've ever been in one... Let's see if I can talk my way through figuring out a star rating... So being completely honest, I would say through the first 55% of this book or so I just felt kind of... I thought it was well written. There were some funny aspects to it, but I also felt like at times that Taddy was a bit too much. I got her character and later on it made sense why she was so brazen and obsessed with orgasms, masturbation, and fucking anything with a penis but in the first part of the book I just found myself not liking her or really any of the characters all that much. It felt like they were trying too hard to be outrageous. Everyone was either all struggling with... Or caught up in... I wasn't able to connect or sympathize with the characters until much later. I know that's one of my personal hang ups. I am fine with people being rich and extravagant in books don't get me wrong some of my favorite characters are those lovely billionaire alpha's that we tend to run into in trilogies! I guess the counselor/advocate in me sometimes just won't turn off and all I can see is white privilege and first world problems and it makes me feel... So at this point I was ready to either chuck the book and say okay this just isn't for me and dnf or finish it and just not rate it since I am sure I am in the minority with my feelings for most of the book. The more parts that were narrated by Warner kept me hanging on and I thought okay maybe I'll finish it and give it 3 stars... But then we hit the 60%ish mark and low and behold Warner is on his - full on grown man, alpha, killing the vagina, I know what I want and that's you forever status... And then I start thinking okay fuck it, let's just forget the first half of this book and ride Warners' face the wave until it's done. Because Warner was just... He was also... And as him and Taddy got closer and more things were revealed I found that by the end I kind of loved her and her squad of crazy goonies, not just Warner ! So... I don't know what do you think Jon? Umm, 3.5 stars ??? And there you have it. Here's my casting...

I loved that there were 4 independent, fabulous fierce friends who shared their lives together while living in NYC!! There is something magical about NYC- I only wished that I would have lived there too!! So, this story is about the lovely, intelligent, take charge, loyal to her friends, sexy, fire cracker, and vulnerable Miss Taddy Brill..... Taddy and the color Red- \"Your passion for life, the confidence you have within you to move forward and the love you give to others and deserve, but never expect in return.\" Taddy is a sex demon who isn't afraid of her sexuality. There were so many funny one liners in this book. She says it like she sees it. She makes no excuses for how she is- she is dynamite and a joy to read. Her friends/family are a great group- Lex, Vive and Blake are all sexy, sassy and there for Taddy no matter what!! In an unexpected trip to St. Barth's- at one of Warner Truman's hotels, worlds collide, Taddy and Warner meet and sparks ignite. Warner is a gentleman. \"May I?\" He is confident, romantic, sexy, knows what he wants and loves his nickname \"Big Daddy\". They have an instant connection, in a bar, over champagne. Sweet Jesus nipplelicious. He's got me. She tripped high on his Big Daddy ecstasy. Being in his arms wasn't a walk through her beloved Central Park. It was a psychedelic journey in Candy Land with a race to her p*ssy castle. She'd waited years to sit, talk, stroke and play with a man such as this. Am I shallow? Abso-fucking-lutely! Who cares? This intensity would be derailed and lost. For the next 6 months, Warner searched for Red, thought of Red and ultimately thought he would never see her again. Taddy, had given up relationships for her New Year's Eve resolution with her friends. They would work on their businesses. Even though Taddy worked nonstop, images of Big Daddy haunted her and of what might have been. In a crazy mishap,(involving a porn star- must read to find out more) Warner and Taddy are reunited in Cannes. Their sexual chemistry is right where they had left it and hot damn it is scorching and panty melting!!! Taddy and Warner are 2 extremely successful people. They don't need money, they have power, but what they both are in need of is someone to share their life. Warner, is ready and has love it give. Taddy, who never had love shown to her, is scared to commit. \"You deserve to be loved. Please let me show you.\" He drew her face to his and kissed her. \"I'll show you if you let me.\" While this is a love story, it is a sassy, sexy, foul mouth good time read!! You will laugh out loud, be happy, blush and enjoy yourself silly while reading. You gotta love a New York Girl. I think if you are not one, you secretly wish you were one. I look forward to reading the rest of The Manhattanites series about Lex, Vive and Blake. Manhattanites are noted as a jaded bunch. We own designer footwear in excess, overspend on vodka cocktails and work sunup to sundown. By accident love takes a backseat but we always find time for sex (wink).

I especially enjoyed Taddy\u2019s interactions with her virginal and highly religious assistant, Kiki. I expected Kiki to come off as kind of a wilting flower around Taddy but she held her own nicely. On the other hand, Taddy relationship with Warner seemed a little stiff and uptight. The writing has an even tone through the entire story so even when something dramatic happens, it still lacks for drama. Not to say I didn\u2019t enjoy it. I did. It\u2019s just that they could\u2019ve been having hot monkey sex against a wall or shopping for shoes and I would\u2019ve felt the same way about both scenes. On to the sex. You know when you get together with your very best male BFF, who also happens to be gay, and you both get drunk and start to write a humorous porno? Please tell me I\u2019m not the only one to have ever done that? The sexy times sort of read like that. Kind of sexy and kind of laugh out loud funny at the same time. She dropped her jaw.

I am going to call foul on one scene that just had me shaking my head in disbelief. Taddy gets so sexually excited by working out on an elliptical and thinking about Warner that she makes herself come while finishing her workout. With her hand. In a gym. Just\u2026NO! After I was done spawning, I lost 60 lbs. of baby weight via elliptical and not once did the thought of getting off in the sexual sense ever cross my mind. I wanted to kick the shit out of it and possibly push it over a cliff, but never once did I get so worked up that I just couldn\u2019t hold off any longer. Working out would be a whole lot more fun if the big O was part of the deal. If you\u2019re in the mood for some serious contemplation and angst, look elsewhere. If you\u2019re looking for some laughs and a good time, give Unscrupulous a shot. ARC provided by the Author via Net Galley in exchange for an honest review ...more DNF at 61 percent.

The girlfriends were pretty vulgar. I couldn't stand \"He's so hung\" over and over. 2. Write what you know. You shouldn't miss on details like champagnes or the airport close to Cannes. And I seriously doubt that two billionaires would act like those two. 3. The sex. It wasn't hot at all for me. The language completely ruined it for me. 4. It was snarky but not romantic. I couldn't feel it. And as a reference, I adore Sex and the City. So the bottom line: I think it's a book you either love or hate. It's not bland at all. And many people love it - so you might as well. Thank you Avery and Netgalley for providing me with an ARC.

Warner Truman is hot, sexy, gorgeous and loaded. And I mean loaded in every sense of the word. But as hot and delicious as Mr. Warner Truman is, the heart of Unscrupulous is Taddy Brill. Taddy is young, beautiful, successful and outrageously sexy. She knows what she wants and is not afraid to say exactly what's on her mind. She built herself an empire where she rules as a benevolent, vajazzled queen. But behind the designer clothes, the gorgeous shoes and the vajazzle lies a vulnerable young woman. I can honestly say that the Taddy's back story had me in tears. She's the epitome of poor, little rich girl. But instead of wallowing in self-pity, Taddy grew up to be a self-assured business woman. That is not to say, she doesn't have issues. She does. But she grew up and learned to acknowledge and change them. Taddy was contented with her business and her hot meaningless affairs until she met Warner Truman. Warner was the opposite of Taddy in every sense. He had a stable family life and was actually married for a decade until his wife died of cancer. With the death of his wife, he never thought he could fall in love again that is until Taddy of course. Their first meeting was a comedy of errors. It was hilarious and hot at the same time. I was giggling the whole time especially when Taddy misheard his name and called him by a sound-alike name the whole time. LOL! I was so embarrassed for her but Warner was such a sweetheart, he just let her call him whatever she wants. \u2665\u2665 Unscrupulous equates fun erotica. The humor runs toward the outrageous and raunchy but never tasteless. This is like Sex and City but younger and actually sexier. And as I mentioned before, this book actually had a lot of heart. The secondary characters; Lex, the bankrupt designer BFF; Vive, the pill popping, gossip magazine Maven; the virginal assistant, Kiki and Blake, the married gay best friend all contributed to Taddy and Will's story. And you can't help but fall in love with them, flaws and all. I have to tell you though, I am pretty much intrigued by Blake and I'm hoping and praying that Ms. Aster will have a book for him. So if you like to read about girls who run their world, who love their men hung, their money, their sexy shoes and their orgasms, and makes no apologies for it, then this book is for you. If you're looking for the answer to the meaning of life and the order of the universe, then this book isn't for you either. But if you're up for some fun, sexy, hot, outrageous read, then you're in luck because Unscrupulous is the book for you. \u2665\u2665 ...more 2 LET-ME-TELL-YOU-WHY STARS Reason #3: The plot.

I wanted to love these characters. I found myself leaning into my kindle waiting for something amazing to pop out about these characters, but nothing happened. Reason #1: The feels. I didn\u2019t FEEL anything!!! Sure. I get it. This is supposed to be a fun, funny, book. But I felt like Ms. Aster wanted me to feel something, whether it be a connection with the friendship between the 3 girlfriends, for the sad pasts of any of the characters\u2026but I wasn\u2019t buying what Ms. Aster was selling. You don\u2019t have to create crazy drama to get me to feel something. You just need to SELL your story and your characters. Make me like them.

It was a little superficial and lacking in depth but this is only my opinion. What I did like was Warner's back story, his history...it was touching and sad and I feel it could have been explored more.....I possibly would have preferred that story...... Warner's 'history' taught him a very important lesson.... Well it doesn't have to be always , but I like the sentiment! lol I thought Warner had a lot of potential but again I couldn't completely warm to him......his character felt disjointed to me I also liked the history behind Tabby.....and the mothers.....it was interesting but again I don't feel it was explored in depth. Tabby seemed quite shallow in many ways...I couldn't get to the heart of her character and so I never really connected with her in anyway which caused major problems for me and my enjoyment of this book. **** I LOVED these quotes from Warner who, in my opinion, was the best part of this story. \"Tonight, I want you to come again and again for me.\" ~ Warner I love that line \u2665 **Thank you to Avery Aster who kindly provided me with an arc of this book via NetGalley ...more 4.5 VAJAZZLING STARS This was a funny, sexy and Taddy \u201cBRILL\u201dIANT read!

This is not your normal love story... it is not deep, it's fun, light, and entertaining. When I was in my teens I llloooovveeeedddd Sex and the City OMG I wanted to be Carrie, I sat there in front of the Tv with my Icecream and drooled on that life In New York,(I'm an English girl I have my girlfriends and went out still do but it wasn't New York, I'm still wanting to go anyway I digress) I was right along the laughs with her friends... And wanted the Cocktails... And I wanted that closet.. Well Taddy 'Red' is living this life, this book has an element of Sex and the city in it, it is like reading that alongside the sexual chemistry she wants with Warner. Warner Truman Warner is a respectable CEO he's dominant, and he wants her.. Taddy Brill 'Red' Taddy Brill is one tough cookie, she does not cry, she doesn't depend on anyone until she meets him.... Ok moving onto the sex, the naughty and the down right saucy... \"Her eyes counted his abs-two(umm), four(ooh), six(holy shit), eight(he's mine).\" Once they find each other there's some HOT scenes, at times I cringed and a lot of times I laughed and was seriously?!! Laugh out loud moments going on.. Even though this is a laugh there is some depth and emotion to Taddy reasons to her tough side.. \"Please don't fall in love with me. I screw everything up. I always have. I always will. Avery's writing is fantastic, she goes into big detail on every emotion, every day and what they're doing, work, fashion, etc.. My criticism would be that because she goes into depth with everything I found it at times difficult to connect to Warner and Taddys romance. So to conclude if your wanting a fun read, HOT men. sexy women then jump right in I'll definitely be reading more books from Avery in the future!!

Believe me, I love a good Erotica book but some of the lines in this one had me cringing \"Milk it. That's it. There you go,\" he moaned hoarsely. \"Get your tongue in my slit, suck me dry.\"Warner grabbed her as his body trembled violently with one final release. Leaning down and kissing her open mouth, he demanded. \"Gimme\" What? She shoved her tongue between his lips, pushing his release back. Slits leaking, cunt creaming, etc. Just not what I think of as sexy...yuk! I could not relate to the heroine, Taddy, Red, Princess Lolly, and so forth and so on. The woman is in heat 24/7 and even gets aroused working out on an Elliptical. I've never gotten aroused on an elliptical...never, ever!! I can't even let go of the handle bars for fear of falling off but she manages to play with herself and orgasm! Bravo!!! I at first loved Warner. I thought this guy is gonna save the story for me!! Oh but he failed me!! Warner, Garner, Big Daddy, Mr Ananconda, King of Candy Land.....too many names!! Anyhow he creeped me out during sex with Taddy, he's calling her Baby Girl, and Young Lady. Scolding her in the midst of having sex, it was just really creepy and not a turn on. Add in a couple of times where he yells \"WOO HOO\" in bed with her and I totally lost the lust for Big Daddy! Omg I'm not even going to go too into the scene with the porn star jacking off outside on the hotel terrace above a huge screaming crowd!! They were actually cheering until they received that unwelcome shower!! Geez, how did that even end up as part of the storyline?? I did kind of like the closure Taddy gets with her sorry ass excuse for a mother @ the end of the book. I wish the story focused more on Warner and Taddy. Took too long for the two to connect and then it was like Instant Love between the two after a night of crazy sex. I'm surprised the lady's vagina didn't fall off!!! Yea and I didn't care for her wanting to be hit or choked during. Glad Warner was not down with that either but he did talk too much during sex. Men don't usually carry on a full articulate conversation during the heat of the moment. I'm sorry I truly wish I could agree with all the other reviews here but I can't be dishonest. It's a big accomplishment to put pen to paper and create a story. I'll give Avery some credit. I just feel the sexy time language needs to be sexy and not utterly vulgar, and you need to make a heroine likable or relatable. The male lead needs to be a strong and yet romantic man, not the Chatty Cathy, galavanting around at the ball in a white feathery thong. This reminded me of that movie \"54\" with Mike Meyers and Ryan Phillipe. All just a bit fruity!! So if you like a book that is pure fluff with a bunch of flamboyant characters who just have plain, dirty sex, then I'd say definitely read this one. *ARC received from Publisher* ...more ARC Received from Author via Net Gallery.

Oh yeah and she has a compulsion to masturbate (pretty much anywhere). She doesn't have much time for a relationship with the amount of time she focuses on her work - but deep down Taddy seems to hide her fear of love behind her sexual antics. \"I'm a perfectionist.\" I'm also an obsessive masturbator, a workaholic and I started smoking again.\" When her, Lex and Vive meet up at a five star resort, she has no idea that the man that captivates her is the successful billionaire who owns Truman Enterprises, which owns and operates the luxury resort she is staying at. But that one night encounter is filled with sexual tension and misunderstanding. Months later their paths cross again and Warner is not going to let his red slip through his fingers again. Okay so we already knew that Avery Aster mixes up the perfect combination of sex and humor, but we get a little bit deeper with this one. Both Taddy and Warner have pain in their pasts and they both have to open up and share those scars with each other. The sex in this melt in your mouth hot, as we get the slow build up to the them actually doing the deed we are given various day dreams that are enough to make you want to pull your panties to the side. We don't get the treat of a sexy voyeuristic three-way but we do get a little treat ;) Between the sassy mouth on the self-made Taddy and the sweetness of Warner I was in complete lust. This is a fantastic series filled with strong women who hold their own and men that are beautiful, rich and well hung. You get a mix of great one-liners and well crafted sex scenes that are in no way toned down. Great supporting characters that you just love and want to see get dirty.

Like Taddy, he's a self-made businessman, powerful and succesful in his international hotel chain business, what creates an immediate bond between the two. He also shares Taddy's love for tits (and that's why he seems to have found a perfect match in her ;D ).

The emotion in this book is stronger, it is still full of the sharp conversation, and witty retorts that Avery is soooo good at, but you really feel there is more going on between this couple and I loved it. Both bear the emotional scars of past hurts, but neither are afraid to look at them, and tackle them head on for the chance of a full relationship with each other.

She also owned her sexuality.She was hilarious ! Avery Aster has an amazing voice. A voice that can empower women to be themselves and not hide behind their own insecurities. So many women get lost in their everyday lives, work, children, etc. But she paints her heroine as a regular woman, flawed but not excessively so. She doesn`t let her problems/flaws deter her in anyway. That`s what I love about this heroine. She has no shame. It has been so long since I have seen a heroine with these traits. Very refreshing.

If you do not know of this man I suggest you Google him immediately. He is also the only man I watch. Shh .. Don`t tell my hubby, he might get a little jealous if he knows I have a favorite. ; ) Warner is amazingly beautiful. Very intelligent as well, can`t get any better than that. He speaks what is on his mind, and doesn`t like to beat around the bush. He expects honesty, as that is what he gives. He knows exactly what he wants. He doesn`t flaunt his wealth, which would be a total turn off. He also talks dirty and says all of the right things. Everything about him is a turn on. \"He was epic from head to toe and back to his other head.\" \"You`d like the champagne`s body to sparkle, sense initial firmness as it fills your mouth and experience a cream rush as you swallow.\" The Bad. Taddy is described as having looks similar to a swim suit model, but she sometimes seems so darn desperate. I don`t like that at all. It`s a bit contradictory. Having such good looks should not make her so desperate. If she is willing to sleep with the hired help, why can`t she go out and have a one nighter with some random at a club, if she has such good looks? Doesn`t make any sense. \"She appreciated his talents for washing her whites and didn`t want to mix his business with her pleasure by letting him lick her clitoris. The last time she`d tried to sleep with her domestic staff they`d sued her for sexual harassment.\" HATED the scene with her masterbating in the pedicure chair and coming onto the pedicurist. It was disgusting really. He got offended and she said, \"Oh sorry. It just feels so good.\" WOW. Okay now my biggest problem. The sex scenes. In an Erotica, the sex scenes are what make the book, usually. This book didn`t have a big plot so the sex scenes were what the reader were looking forward too. This book flopped. We have to wait more than half the book for their first intercourse. Which I had no problem with. But, when it came, I wanted to stop reading. That scene was the one that was supposed to make the reader see that they were meant to be, that they were developing feelings for one another. That didn`t happen. There was no connection whatsoever. Taddy being snarky and whitty in her head? No. For the scene to fall flat and me not being able to feel the connection was disappointing. I mean he`s \"hammering into her\" and she is thinking about her assistant/friend. That really took away a lot for me. I just couldn`t feel it. Definitely didn`t flow. During the whole scene he is doing his thing, and he has a HUGE cock btw, So he`s doing it good. but here taddy lays taking it but not making a peep. I like my sex scenes to be realistic- moaning, groaning, panting. I didn`t get any of that though. So I didn`t feel anything in return. He can`t be that good if she can`t keep her mind on the task at hand. Especially a task with a man like him. During this 4 page long scene, with how it is worded/written, I`m imagining her lying there doing nothing. That is not sexy or intimate in my opinion. She seems cold and detached, but the writer is telling you to feel otherwise. And the first time anal with the \"horse cock\" would cause one to scream. It would not be as easy as portrayed in this book. The only thing she said when he penetrated her was, \"it burns.\" NO. WAY. For the first time it is almost impossible, especially with the little prep he did give her. Way too unrealistic for me. It was just terrible. I hate saying that. Truly. But I have to be honest. Cunt I can do, but muff? NO ! Clit is fine, but kernel? NO ! How in the world could that be considered hot? WTF? \"Oh baby let me lick your kernel !\" UGH. And.. No sexy billionaire should ever say, \"WOO-HOO, I L-O-V-E you and I love it when you`re soaked for me.\" Soaked? Yes. Woo-Hoo? NO ! This book just fell flat for me. I loved the snark and banter. But the love just wasn`t there, and that`s what I wanted. Instead of the writer showing you the connection she just told you what it was. I wouldn`t recommend this to anyone that wants an amazing love story with angst. I would reccomend if you want some laughs though. : ) ARC provided by the Author via Net Galley in exchange for an honest review. ...more Book courtesy of Net Galley and Ellora's Cave ! Great read !

Oh and we can not forget Kiki, her very young , naive, virginal Morman assistant! Taddy is from an upperclass well known family, who well for lack of better words on my part; has treated Taddy like shit, sent her off to boarding school and never looked back; everything Taddy has is because she has worked for it. For all of Taddy's success, thanks to her family real relationships are an issue, sure she dates, well one night stands and she is in control, never loosing control of her emotions; tll she meets Warner Truman, successful billionaire hotel and spa mogul. Now, you would think that being Warner owns the hotel in Times Square across the street from Taddy's office and they travel in the same circles they would have met before, but no. Taddy heads to St Bart's will her girlfriends for a getaway and meets Warner quite by accident at one of his clubs attached to his hotel and spa in St Bart's. For the two of them the chemistry is immediate and the encounter hot as hell, but what starts off promising tanks really fast. Taddy will not encounter Warner again for months, months of working non stop, building her empire, no men no sex and invading thoughts of him. What is that, oh how do they wind up together again you ask? Good question. Taddy has to fly to Caanes to bail out Kiki , yes , you remember Kiki the virginal Morman assistant, seems she was arrested for well a little something to do with pornography , but. I digress, besides the author tells so much better than I ever could. Needless to say , it turns out this all happened at one of Warner's properties, so to get Kiki charges dropped Taddy trades her PR expertise and her time . Warner , who has not been able to get Taddy off his mind has just hit the jackpot. Well, I think Taddy has too, because sex with Warner is incredible and for Taddy frightening because Warner wants the emotional connection ; and thanks to her family emotional is a challenge . Warner is patient, loving, supportive and committed to making this relationship work and the sex is like nothing she has had before. So have I told you enough plot line yet? I think so! Great read, great characters and soooooo....... Looking forward to the next book, next up Blake's story. and I hope more of that delicious Warner , well okay Taddy too! ...more ARC provided by author via Netgalley.

He is a sexy, sweet, beautiful man & a total hunkadoris! ;) He finally meets his match in Taddy, and decides he has to have her. I thought this book was funny, between the people watching, the vajazzling, and the Palm Beach DILF's.:) I enjoyed how Taddy had all her close friendships with her outrageous, eccentric, socialites, and how she cared for her assistant Kiki & her other employees. The only thing I didn't like about the book was some of the language used. I just had trouble really connecting fully with the characters & a lot of the sexual wording wasn't for me. -\"It's not my intention to be a diva. It just happens. I wake up like I'm flippin' Beyonc\u00e9 or something.\"-Taddy Brill, CEO of Brill, Inc. -She wanted to jump on top of him and say, \"He's mine-all mine.\" -Her eyes counted his abs up -two(umm), four(ooh), six(holy shit), eight(he's mine). -Warner Truman and Big Daddy were the same man. -She stood, surprised and more certain than ever that Warner Truman was hers to have. -\"You deserve to be loved. Please let me show you.\" -Love sounded better than music. It felt better than words. Warner was love. ...more 4.5 Vajazzled, sexy, steamy stars!

Warner is all in and ready to start something real with her, but Taddy doesn't do relationships and needs some help in that department. I didn't hate this book, but I also didn't like. I skimmed for most of it because I was just bored. It was supposed to be a fun and humorous book and I was looking forward to that, but none of the humor was for me. Well, I guess that's a lie. I had to laugh at how ridiculous the sexy times were. \"What are we going to do about your sex spigot?\" \"Stop my spout up.\" Taddy didn't make me laugh, she made me want to punch her obnoxious ass. I may not have hated the book, but I sure did hate her character. She was so vain and spoiled and I just couldn't handle it. I should have realized from the very beginning when she was talking about her employee's and then saying she would have her assistant get a boob job. I didn't really have any feelings about Warner because he was barely in the book. We learned the very basics about him but that was it and then what we learned was never explored. Most of the book was just Taddy and her \"Manhatinites\" so I wanted more of him. I think I would have liked the book more if there was more interaction between Taddy and Warner. P.S. Big Daddy? Just no. Okay? NO! ...more **ARC kindly provided by author via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review** 5 STARS! I was hooked from the first sentence!

Oh, how I enjoy these stuff! However, you'll have to read the book to find out since I'm going to keep my mouths closed on that matter :) Taddy became emancipated from her parents at 16 years. Emotionally fragile girl very quickly grew tough and fierce, founded her own company Brill, Inc., shut down her emotions and became unscrupulous in her actions to get whatever she wants from life. From the outside her life seemed fabulous and glamorous, Taddy was super-rich, witty, sharp tongued, stunning and very successful businesswoman with an amazing and supporting friends, but she never got over abandonment. Her favorite color was red, color of passion, strength and power. She gave her love freely to other people not expecting nothing in return. Loving someone was never an option for her, that was a risk she wasn't willing to take. Her past hunted her and her life credo was: \u201eI never meet men with any expectations other than having a good time. Then I\u2019m never disappointed.\u201c That was so sad. She never felt loved and nobody has ever said those three magic words, we all crave to hear, to my poor Taddy, until she met Him! With her money she bought 127 scarves, 249 wraps, 341 hats, 495 gloves, 681 sunglasses, 759 belts, 989 handbags, 1,092 rings, 1,217 pairs of shoes, 1,355 necklaces, and 3,512 pairs of earrings. Dear Lord!!! Yes, I was a bit jealous, but not too much, because I know the whole story and I wouldn't trade my place with her. Well, maybe for Big Daddy I will reconsider doing it. *evil grins* \u201eMoney always turned her on. Not other people\u2019s cash, just hers, and it was all Brill, Inc.\u2019s.\u201c \u201eWaris Sugar, you\u2019re preventing me from getting laid. Turn down this flippin\u2019 music.\u201c \u201eShe\u2019d waited years to sit, talk, stroke and play with a man such as this.Am I shallow? Abso-fucking-lutely! Who cares?\u201c \u201eShe tripped high on his Big Daddy ecstasy. Being in his arms wasn\u2019t a walk through her beloved Central Park. It was a psychedelic journey in Candy Land with a race to her pussy castle.\u201c Hahhahahah, you gotta love her naughty thoughts! Taddy was a great heroine to read about, she always spoke her mind, her inner monologues were comical, and not forget to mention her wild fantasies, enormous porn collection, obsession with Brayden Brooks, pleasure room with BDSM equipment and her hilarious efforts to help her Mormon assistant to get rid of her virginity. BIG DADDY Unlike Taddy, he was raised in loving home and wasn't terrified of intimacy. He was happily married to Josephine for ten years before she had died. She teached him that woman always comes first. Oh, God bless you! Being dirty rich, Warner was constant target of many gold diggers. He almost marry one, luckily he found out the truth before it was too late thanks to her stupid mistake when she had attempted to screw his brother. Yeah, you failed bitch! \u201eIf I ever fall for a woman again, she\u2019ll have her own money.\u201d Poor guy was already sick and tired of all those attention craving money-whores. Luckily, destiny brought Taddy to him as an award for all that suffering he has been through. She was his perfect match, but boy, did he has to work to his ass off to get to her. Her walls were up and it took him a lot of efforts to get close to her and convince her to give them a chance they both deserved. \u201eHe found a perverse pleasure in her independence. In the past, his girlfriends had jumped at the chance to drop everything and follow him around the world. Not Taddy. He\u2019d finally met his match.\u201c \u201eHe figured Taddy was similar to a man in the way that to get her attention he\u2019d have to use sex.\u201c Overall, I really enjoyed reading this book.

The author did a great job in the beginning of the book of listing and describing the important main and supporting characters of the book. Unscrupulous focuses on Tabitha \"Taddy Brill\" Adelaide Brillford and Warner Truman. Taddy Brill is a successful and self-made millionaire and owner of Brill Inc. She grew up into a wealthy and socialite family in New York. Taddy didn't have the best relationship with her parents especially her mother, Countess Irma. Her childhood best friend, Lex Easton was the only person whom Taddy was able to lean on for support and love. As a successful business woman, Taddy is surrounded by a great support system with her friends, Vive and Blake and also her personal assistant Kiki. Taddy has her friends, money, and her company but she still lacks one thing that is missing in her life which is LOVE. \" Other than my friends I don't let a lot of people into my life.\" Taddy's world is turned upside down when she meets Warner Truman aka Big Daddy. Warner is a billionaire widower who owns Truman Enterprises. Taddy meets Warren at one of his resorts and sparks and attraction are in full swing. A misunderstanding ruins their first encounter but several months later these two are reunited. Once reunited these two have chemistry. The alpha male in Warner comes out and soon Taddy finally lets go of the walls surrounding her heart and lets Warner in. Both Taddy and Warner enjoys calling each other the nickname they assigned to each other: Red and Big Daddy. \"Red, did you hear me? I said you make me happy.\" \" My love for you is going to grow more and more over time.\" What I like about the book: This book has a great supporting cast in Lex, Vive, Blake and Kiki. I like that Kiki was able to hold on to her own when dealing with Taddy I like that we get an alternating POV from Taddy and Warner I enjoyed the banter among Taddy and her friends and with Waner What I didn't like about the book: I felt the first half of the book dragged out a bit. I think the readers understood after several pages that Taddy was sexually frustrated and had personal family issues. After passing 55% of the book, the story line finally picks up. I wished the book focused more on Taddy and Warner's relationship because it felt so short.. I wanted to learn more about them as a couple and it felt rushed that they were already exchanging \"I love you's.\" to each other. I would rate this book between a 2.75-3. . If you are looking for a book with less angst and a happily ever after then Unscrupulous is a book for you. ...more<---C>Avery Aster</---C>", "Title": "Unscrupulous"},
