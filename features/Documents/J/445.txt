Or maybe a 4. Some of the concepts were a bit unrealistic, and the scenes that I was excited about the most sort of... let me down. I still love the series, don't get me wrong. I'll update as often as possible. If you guys want some good news, scroll down until the end of this review. Guys... It's done. The series is over, and I'm shaking and I want to cry out of happiness because it ended on a terrific note and sadness because my favorite series is over . This series, and by series I mean the PJO series and the HOO series, they were my childhood. They helped me feel better when I was sad and now it's over. I mean, can you believe it? This insane journey we all rode together? Some readers have waited almost 10 years, others have waited 5. And now it's over. I don't think there are enough gifs in the world to show you guys what I'm feeling. So for my review: I'm going to go in the order of the people who had POVs and then the rest of the characters. Jason: He has developed so much in this series. At the beginning of the series he's so formal and always follows the rules, but in <+++>The Blood of Olympus</+++> , he is so kickass (<---B>not that he wasn't at the beginning of the series</---B>), he loosens up, and he starts to follow his heart instead. Reyna: I loved her POV so much; we learn tons about her and her past. She is a very interesting character who I hope will find what she secretly wishes she has (hint: love). Her relationship with Nico was a very sisterly relationship and I am so glad he has someone like her. Nico: Boy, oh boy. I love this kid, and I loved how he managed to overcome his fears and stand out. There's a scene at the end of the book that I loved so much, (view spoiler) [Nico goes up to Percy with all his sassiness and tells Percy that he had a crush on him. Annabeth smiles and they both high-five while Percy is left dumbstruck. (I wish I could have given Nico the high-five.) (hide spoiler) ] Bianca would have been so proud of her little brother. Leo: My baby Leo. *sighs* He is the bravest hero in this series. I love him to pieces more than any other character (except for maybe Percy, Leo's only a millimeter behind him) and I am so proud of him. Unlike me, he's very good at sucking things up and accepting them as they are. He might think he's a coward, but I think he's a warrior. And, he always *winks* keeps his promises. Piper: Ooooooh my gosh I cannot tell you guys how underrated this girl was. She is so kickass, she is right up there with Reyna. She stays strong throughout the whole book and helps others. And my gosh, her and Annabeth are one super ass-whooping team. Percy: This kid. THIS KID. One of the main things that irritated me in this book was that he did not have a POV. Even though the book is still fantastic without his POV, I was a bit disappointed. I have to admit though, his relationships with the other demigods on the Argo II have really strengthened. Especially between Jason and Leo. Though he's traumatized by his unexpected trip to Tartarus, this kiddo stays strong. He opens up to Jason about this. I'm really sad this series has ended, but I'm glad he can finally chill with Annabeth. Annabeth: Annabeth, like Percy, was traumatized because of Tartarus. She really opens up to Piper about this, like Percy does to Jason. She and Percy will probably be my OTP forever and forever; I love them so much. (view spoiler) [She and Percy and going to spend senior year together and will then go to New Rome for college. EEEEEEK!! (hide spoiler) ] Note: She doesn't have a POV either. Hazel: This chick is dangerous. Her magical powers really come into play in this book. Without her powers, everything would have went completely off track. She doesn't have a POV, like Percy and Annabeth. There isn't much left to say because we didn't have a POV from her, but from what I can tell, she's really in tune with herself and she obviously has mastered her magic. (view spoiler) [Hazel and Frank decide to go back to Camp Jupiter. She is now the Centurion of the Fifth Cohort. (hide spoiler) ] Frank: Talk about lead. Frank is definitely cut out for Praetor; he's really good at telling people what to do (in a good way) and thinks before he acts. Even though he's not our chubby baby man anymore on the outside, the chubby baby man is in the inside, fo' sure. There's nothing else I can say except that he has also developed significantly (physically and personally) because we also didn't have a POV from him. Yup, so that's it. Honestly, even though the book sorta ended a little... open, I really loved it. My childhood has come to an end. Maybe I'll start obsessing over the new Magnus Chase series (view spoiler) [He's Annabeth's cousin (hide spoiler) ] , even though I'm too old for it. If you guys want some other spoilers, send me a message on my Goodreads or my Tumblr (the-banono-fruit.tumblr.com) and I'll ruin the book for you ;) STOP RIGHT HERE. Okay. So after reading <+++>The Blood of Olympus</+++> , some of you guys might be like this: Or this: Because your favorite series is over, and oh my! What book are you going to obsessively fangirl/boy over now??? I will tell you guys which book(s), but you guys have to listen to me carefully. THERE'S GONNA BE A SEQUEL TO PERCY JACKSON'S GREEK GODS !!! Yeah, I said it! It's gonna be called \"Percy Jackson's Greek Heroes\". Don't believe me? (I have no idea why you wouldn't, but) Well, lemme entertain you with these two wonderful links: Link 1 Link 2 You're welcome. *bows* Some other stuff you guys might be interested in: I think Riordan might answer some questions we readers have in his Riordan-ish ways in Percy Jackson's Greek Heros and the third PJO/KC crossover. I think he might make a reference like Annabeth did in The Staff of Serapis (She referred to Frank in it, if you don't know.). The end. I'M READIN' THIS RIGHT NOW YO And it. Is. AWESOME. I'll put up a full review when I finish it!! FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOTTEN THE BOOK: HOW?! (And also, don't post spoilers. Not cool, bruh.) Yes I've read them, yes I know what's going to happen, yes I read them on Tumblr (stay away from that site it is dangerous I'm telling you) and yes, I will post them online. HAHAHAHA! Just kidding, I ain't that cruel. I will say one thing about them spoilers: I am pleased. Oh yeah: some of you guys may have heard about the character quotes/clues from BOO. HERE THEY ARE!!! ALL OF THEM, INCLUDING ANNABETH'S!! Who will survive the final battle? Hazel Hazel stuck the point of her spatha under Nike's chin. \"Explain,\" her voice was harder than Leo had ever heard it. \"Which of us will die? How do we stop it?\" Nike said, \"Ah, child of Pluto. Your magic helped you cheat in this contest, but you cannot cheat destiny. One of you will die. One of you must die.\" Jason Jason knew he shouldn't look. But he couldn't close his eyes as Juno went supernova, revealing her true godly form. Pain seared Jason's mind. His body burned away in layers like an onion. Leo It was a long shot. If he failed, it would crush him. Not just emotionally. It would physically crush him. Percy Jason had never met this particular giant, but he had heard stories. The giant shook his dreadlocks and a dozen serpents swam free, each one lime green with a frilled crown around its head. Basilisks. \"Indeed, son of rome,\" the giant said. \"But if you will excuse me, my immediate business is with Perseus Jackson. I tracked him all the way across Tartarus and here in his father's ruins, I mean to crush him, once and for all.\" Piper Aphrodite's words came back to Piper. You must bridge the gap between Romnan and Greek camps, for child, neither storm nor fire can succeed without you. Aphrodite had warned her of what was to come and what she would have to do to stop Gaea. Whether or not Piper would have the courage, Ppiper didn't know. Reyna She couldnt tell her friends how much she feared ghosts or why she feared them. The whole reason she and her sister had run away from San Juan all those years ago... that secret had to stay buried. Nico The wind god Favonius had warned him in Croatia. If you let your anger rule you... your fate will be even sadder than mine. But how could his fate be anything but sad? Even if he lived through this quest, he would have to leave both camps forever. Frank Frank ran out of arrows. He changed into a rhinocerous and leaped into battle but as fast as he knocked down the giants, they got up again. Their wounds seemed to be healing faster. Annabeth \"That's my point,\" Percy said. \"We don't know what is down there. I am going with you.\" \"No,\" Annabeth said, and put her hand on his arm, \"If the giants want our blood, the last thing we need is a boy and a girl going down there together. Remember, they want one of each for their big sacrifices.\" -----RIDICULOUSLY LONG REVIEW THAT REALLY ISN'T A REVIEW STARTS HERE----- Clearly, if you saw my previous review of this book, the other supposed title of the fifth book was totally wrong. So\u2026 the Blood of Olympus . Sounds\u2026 bloody, don't you think? Still, I was sooo excited when I saw the title. I was like: But anyways, the House of Hades was epically amazing. I'm pretty sure anyone who's read it would totally agree with me. Anyways, my predictions. OH WAIT! You may not want to read this if you haven't read the House of Hades, cuz this is definitely gonna contain spoilers. \u2022 So, n\u00famero uno: Leo is gonna go back for Calypso. When? Probably during the book, or after they defeat all the baddies. I swear, if he doesn't, I'm gonna go crazy. \u2022 Dos: Percy (or Annabeth) will find out about Nico and his secret-that-isn't-a-secret-to-Jason. \u2022 Tres: Someone's gonna die. It wouldn't be realistic for a good guy to NOT die. It's not like I want a good guy to die, but let's face it\u2014 even Rick Riordan agrees. Maybe it'll be Rayna (she'll deffo go \u2022 Cuatro: after the seven win (They WILL win, they have to!), the gods might offer immortality. I have a feeling that someone (most likely Leo, cuz of Calypso, with her being immortal and all) will take up that offer. So, what are your predictions? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Update! You guys are gonna kill me, but\u2026 I think Nico might die. WAIT! Don't kill me yet, you've gotta hear me out! So. This is my list of why the other characters WON'T die: \u2022 Percy: If he died, no one would touch a book by Rick Riordan. No one. And RR knows that's bad because a) he'll loose all his fans and b) no cha-ching. Oh. And he could be part of the \"storm and fire\" thing from the prophecy. (Storm = Percy & Jason, fire = Leo) \u2022 Annabeth: If she died, Percy would feel terrible. If the series ends with Percy feeling terrible, well, just look at my first point. Annabeth needs Percy. And Percy needs Annabeth. We all know what Percy would do for a friend. Imagine what he would do for Annabeth. If they went through the same thing that happened in MOA, Percy would gladly fall into Tartarus. Again. \u2022 Piper: A lot of people don't care if she dies or not. As a matter of fact, some people have asked RR to just kill her or something (check RR's twitter). I think the \"We don't like Piper\" comments is why she WILL stay alive. RR doesn't take requests from the fans. \u2022 Jason: He's not gonna die, because, well, he's just NOT. I don't really know how to explain it. But I know he won't. I can't imagine him dead. And it's not like I like him more than Percy (That would be impossible, I don't know why anyone would choose Jason over Percy), but Jason is not the type of character you can kill off. \u2022 Leo: He's not gonna die because he's part of the prophecy (see first point) and many fans would be ticked off if he died. And there's also Calypso! He might find her AFTER the war. \u2022 Hazel: Who wants to die again? Not Hazel. RR's not gonna make a character he brought back from the dead die again. What's the use? \u2022 Frank: Yeah, yeah, he's got his little stick. That's exactly why he's going to live. I know he has to use the stick for something, but it's not gonna make him die. He's going to stay alive, but he's going to have to sacrifice something first to keep breathing. Yeah\u2026 That's all I've got. OMG OMG OMG UPDATE UPDATE My oh my! You guys will not believe what I realized!!! I've realized that Rick Riordan knows how important his biggest moneymakers (Percy and Annabeth) are to us fans, and therefore, he will not kill them in The Blood of Olympus !!! So I know you guys are like, How do you know?! I would say that I \"have my ways\", but no mis amigos, I simply read The Staff of Serapis . Is this a spoiler? I don't think so. Riordan wants us to know that Percy and Annabeth won't die in the Blood of Olympus . When I was reading the crossover, it was so obvious that it took place after the Heroes of Olympus, someone might as well have written \"ANNABETH AND PERCY ARE ALIVE AND HEALTHY AND STILL KICKING BUTT AFTER THE BLOOD OF OLYMPUS .\" So that means the Son of Sobek took place after the Heroes of Olympus But when I read the part that screamed, \"They're alive!\" I couldn't even contain my feels. I was already feeling icky from allergies and sneezing, but when I read it, I was wheezing like I ran a mile. Apparently my OMG moment was loud, 'cause my mom came in and told me take a Claritin. I just looked at her like: I don't even know why I'm surprised. I mean, I'm the one who told you guys why they wouldn't die. I guess we all can come to a conclusion that I'm just weird like that. So while you guys ponder about my weirdness, I'm just gonna... UPDATE The cover!!! Gorgeous. Just. Gorgeous! I gotta say though, I'm a little irked that Percy and Annabeth aren't on the cover. Actually, I expected all seven of the demigods (and maybe Nico) to be on the cover. Nevertheless, dem Romans be looking hecka awesome. Let's hope (I think we all know they will) they do some major butt kicking. On another note, Nico's going to narrate! RR confirmed this on his Twitter a few weeks ago. Nico fans will finally get their wish! Yayyyy :) ANOTHER UPDATE Sooooooo The Staff of Serapis came out as an ebook today! And along with it, came an excerpt from... THE BLOOD OF OLYMPUS! Some of you might be like, OMG I want to read it but I have to buy it first! :( Well, let's turn those frowns upside down! If you guys have an Apple device, you can download the iBooks app. Search for The Staff of Serapis, and download a sample of the book. I don't know how many pages there are in the excerpt if you buy The Staff of Serapis, but in the sample there are about 6-7 pages. Unfortunately for Kindle-users, the ebook sample doesn't include the BOO excerpt. However, the excerpt will be free online for everyone to enjoy later on in the summer. Here's some info about the excerpt (first chapter, whatever you wanna call it): - Jason's narrating! - He's with Piper and Annabeth I wanna tell you guys more (heck, I could tell you guys everything down to the last detail), but I don't want to spoil it for you, which is weird because I love spoiling things like this. So use my weird moment for yourselves and READ DA EXCERPT! YO YO YO IT'S AN UPDAAAAAAAATE!!! REYNA HAS A POV. REYNA HAS A POV. REYNA HAS A FRIGGIN POV OOOOOMG I honestly did not expect that. I found out on Tumblr and I was like, Riordan's probably messin' with us. Cuz you know, Reyna (it's not like I don't like her, but...)...? And then. AND THEN. I checked his Twitter. I just crumbled and started to roll all over my bed and I think I looked like a rabid squirrel.

It's the final show down where The Heroes of Olympus, our heroes finally show the giants who's boss. I know I'm coming across as conceited by saying that they will win, but: 1. This book is pitched for tweens - how can there not be a happily ever after? 2. My brain which is slightly irrational when it comes to anything Riordan related refuses to accept the possibility that anything bad could happen ...Oka so I might be in denial here, but w I am so pumped for the finale of this amazing series!

Mingled amongst the excitement, there's apprehension. Because it is the end. No more laugh out loud Leo, adorable Percybeth moments, or the final quests where nothing goes according to plan? Nada. I'm feeling a little weepy inside Okay, so maybe a lot would be more accurate The only plus side I can see to this whole 'last-book-int-the-series' dilemma is that if there is one person who can conclude a book series like no other (recall; The Last Olympian ), it is Riordan! ...more WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS, IF YOU READ THIS AND SPOIL YOURSELF IT\u2019S YOUR OWN FAULT NOT MINE!!!!!!!!! Let me start by saying I cried while writing this because this world holds a special place in my heart. Ok so I have to say this straight away, I'm not someone who grew up reading Percy Jackson, no I'm horrified to say I watched the movie first, but even though I didn't grow up with the characters and loved them more and more through time I fell in love with them like I ran into a brick wall, HARD WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS, IF YOU READ THIS AND SPOIL YOURSELF IT\u2019S YOUR OWN FAULT NOT MINE!!!!!!!!! Let me start by saying I cried while writing this because this world holds a special place in my heart. Ok so I have to say this straight away, I'm not someone who grew up reading Percy Jackson, no I'm horrified to say I watched the movie first, but even though I didn't grow up with the characters and loved them more and more through time I fell in love with them like I ran into a brick wall, HARD. So hard it could make me cry in pain. I read the first series in one week (school week) and I just couldn't stop there so I read the fist 2 books in the HoO series and painfully waited for Mark of Athena. And let me say thank you Rick Riordan for creating my favourite series ever. I would also like to say I read BoO in 8 hours. I regretted nothing the next day except for the lack of sleep I got, and yes it was a school night :) Oh well! Let me start with saying I did not hate this book, I loved it but just not as much as any of the other books. When you continue reading you will see why. I'm going to do a summary in every character now so get a drink and some food because this is a rally long read. Jason Insert clap here! Jason you little piece of sexiness where have you been this whole entire series. You guys may not know but I hated Jason, couldn't stand him in the first books! But during House of Hades I got so much more respect for him, he was so supportive of Nico and I felt like he stepped up in these last two books. The book started with his POV which you know i was fine with I didn't care. When they were at that place and his mum showed up though I was sitting there going oh my Gods what is he going to do? I mean it must be hard to see his mum even if it\u2019s not really her, any child would want to be with their parent, it natural. But the way he was so strong that whole time was inspirational even if Piper and Annabeth were helping him through it. Second point, the bromances he has are awesome!!! The one with Nico is such a brotherly bond, its like he feels like he has to protect Nico, like when he says he is worried about him and wants him to be safe, I mean when he could possibly be dying he is telling Piper that Nico is in tricking trouble, I mean if thats not something then I don't know what is. Next bromance is the best friend rivalry with Percy, putting those two in a room together should end with world war three but they act like best bros. When Percy tells Jason at least he didn't get knocked out and Jason tells him to piss off I'm just sitting there with the biggest grin on my face (partly because i was thinking the exact same thing). But I also love their little competition over who is the most powerful, like the whole part where Percy was like I don't want to kill Jason and Jason was like or I could kill you. So perfect. Third point is his relationship with Piper. The only thing that I need to say about this relationship is about how at the very end he remade Pipers memory of their first kiss. At that moment I wanted to scream into a pillow. By the end of this series I can proudly say Jason you have earned my respect, you may not be my favourite character but you are now right up near my favourites, so well done. Piper In all honesty Piper never stood out to me as a character I could love as much as I do the others, now don't hate on me because remember this is MY review, so its MY opinions :) Thank you. Now I don't like reading her POV because it doesn't seem to keep my attention as much as the others but I did start them more in this book. One thing that Piper has taught me is that you can be beautiful on the outside but its the inside that counts and I know that we hear that all the time but in all honesty who actually believes that whole heartedly? Piper is just so strong minded and she doesn't care who her Godly parent is, she creates her own path, she doesn't let a prophecy or parent tell her what she should or shouldn't do. Also how strong did her charm speak get!!!!! You go girl!!!! I mean she even made Jason nearly fall unconscious when she was telling Gaia to fall asleep! She single handedly made Gaia fall asleep so they could defeat her. Can I just say that moment when Piper is teaching Annabeth, a daughter of Wisdom, someone who thinks strategically and always has a plan how to let your emotions guide you was really moving. Annabeth was really struggling to let go of all her thoughts and ideas and to just focus on how she was feeling and lets be honest, the moment when they touched foreheads shipping names were all over tumblr. Through this series I have had empathy for Piper because of how hard her relationship with Jason was and how she felt like she was stereotypically thought to be a princess and not like to fight because Aphrodite is her parent and the way she dealt with this was so amazing and inspirational. Hazel Ok im putting it out there, WHERE WAS HAZEL IN THIS BOOK?? Yes she was mentioned, yes she had a cool fighting scene or two, but where the hell was she. In all honesty I felt like her and Frank were just not given as much book time as anyone else and thats just not fair because of how amazing they are. So because she was barely in the book in my eyes I'm going to talk about the thing that stood out the most for me in this book. Her Mist powers were amazing in this book, if it wasn't for her where would they be right now? Dead thats where all of them would be. She made Jason into an old man so they could find out so information and at the same time she made sure the Argo II wouldn't be seen. You go girl! Also when her, Frank, Leo and Percy were in that arena to fight it out to the death I fell in love with her Mist powers so much more, like dudes she made a moving maze with her mind!!! How cool is that????? I feel like she has learnt so much about how to control her gem power thing, and how to control the Mist. She has also completely gotten over her feelings for Sammy (from what I saw) and is now fulling focused on how she feels about Frank and isn't confused about Leo. Frank Again WHERE WAS FRANK IN THIS BOOK? And if I get comments saying he did this he did that I'm not saying he didn't do anything I just don't think he got the attention he deserved. He just became a leader of the Roman camp and we don get to see how he is handling this new found strength, we don't get to see how worried he is that he might die because of that fire on a stick. I mean he was told that either himself, Hazel, Percy or Leo were going to die so I would be freaking out like no tomorrow about making sure that flame is still burning. I really love him turning into any animal because every time someone is explaining what each demigod is doing in battle they go to Frank and say something like Frank is a Gorilla hanging from something or Frank is a fish or Frank comes swooping in as an eagle. Yeah because thats normal. Reyna Reyna you are one awesome, strong minded girl!!!!! Im actually so happy we got her POV, i wasn't sure if i would like it at first but I really did, I love the sisterly bond she got with Nico in this book!!! And whats with that whole i can give you energy thing?? Ummm awesome. I really liked the reunion between Reyna and Hylla. I felt like it was a nice insight into her life and helped us find out how she became the person she is today. I also really like the back story of her family and father, and how she actually has broken important Roman Camp rules. Even though the back story seemed forced into the book I really like it and felt it gave her more personality and gave people a bigger understanding to the way she is. Nico OH NICO HOW I LOVE YOU!!! Lets start with his moment with his dad, Hades. Hades is someone who is thought to show no compassion at all, he's thought to show no love or sympathy for his children, so when he took his time to see Nico i was so happy and jumping with joy! I mean its not everyday we see this side of the God of the Underworld. But the part that i thought was the most beautiful bit in this conversation was when Hades told Nico he understood his feelings for Percy and didn't hate him or that they made him look down on Nico. He told Nico children of Hades are rarely happy and he wants Nico to be that exception. I mean how beautiful is that?! Next is his crush on Percy which we really get to understand in this book, its not as strong as I originally thought but thats ok because not everyone fall in love with everyone, people get small crushes too. But at some moments when he described Percy made me want to give Nico a big hug and tell him everything will be alright. But i couldn't :( I like how though out this book we saw him also get over his crush that he has for Percy, which is good because how boring would it be if all he is thinking is Percy this Percy that. One of the parts in the book that brought me to tears (i get emotionally attached so ill probably mention crying a lot. It\u2019s not my fault), it was this part She said we so easily, as if she and Percy were interchangeable, inseparable. Nico had once read a story from Pluto\u2026all humans had been a combination of male and female\u2026. Zues split them in half-man and woman. Ever since, humans had felt incomplete. They spent their lives searching for their other halves. And where does that leave me? Nico wondered. It wasn't his favourite story. Im sorry but that is beautifully sad. I cut some bits out but you get what I'm saying, he feels like there is no one out there for him, but there is! [image error] Now I cant forget about his awesome powers that are just amazingly scary!!!!! I love when he was searching for Thalia and ended up getting in someone from Camp Half-bloods dreams (cant remember who but still) that was hilarious, especially when he said it happens often! He also happened to kill that dude (again forgot his name) like it was nothing! He can be one scary dude. I get so many different emotions when he uses his powers and only this gif can describe it. But I love him! Leo I have to admit the whole book i was going no Leo is going to die! No, no, no!! But at the same time i thought it would be Percy, but that was just me being paranoid. By the end though I pretty much knew it was Leo who was going to die because all the signs pointed to him! But in the end he didn't even die and what annoys me the most about that is he went back for Calypso (yay! she is free) and no one else knows he is alive. Thats how it ends. No just no. I mean a 100 years could have past and everyones dead! I felt like it was really important to have Leo talk to Percy. Leo obviously has strong feelings for Calypso (i mean he has a portrait of her in his room, i call a little creepy) and he is angry at Percy for breaking that promise he made with Calypso. I laughed so much when Leo told Percy that he isn't alright because he cant bring himself to hate the guy!!! :D (but lets be honest no one can hate Percy!) I adore that they both have very similar humour, it just makes this book even funnier. Leos relationship with Calypso to me felt a bit force, it was like oh Leo is a seventh wheel and needs someone to date. Sorry but thats how I feel. Sure I can see it happen in the future and being even stronger but now not so much. Annabeth \u2026 I think you already know what I'm going to say. A really important part for my in this whole book was when Piper and her were together and she begins to talk about Tarturus and what happened in there with Percy. I still remember reading/watching reviews and barely anyone mentioned the big fact that Percy controlled poison. If you cant remember Annabeth was terrified of him when he did that, now she finally tells Piper how scared she was. She tells Piper that she cant get the look he had on his face out of her head. To her it must seem like Luke happening all over again. [image error] When the crew was at Sparta and Piper and Annabeth were together you could actually feel the gears turning in her head to create a plan, because she is the daughter of wisdom and cant she cant help but make a plan A, B and C, its in her blood. The last bit that I'm going to talk about is when they are in Acropolis near the end of the book and they go underground and are at the place where the Athena and Poseidon rivalry started he just kisses her which leaves her so stuns which is amazing because she barely gets caught off guard. Then she gets a cut on her leg and she spills the first blood to wake Gaia. I could really ramble on and on but I really shouldn't so I'm going to finish with one last thing. Thank you Annabeth, thank you for showing girls its ok to be the strongest, wisest and bravest of the bunch, thank you for showing girls that its ok to be better then boys in most if not all things. Thank you for teaching me so much and being such a strong female character, you are my favourite female character by far because you are not weak, you think things through and you are just not annoying. [image error] Thank you. Percy You know what I'm just not even going to mention it. I loved how Percy just knew that Leo had met Calypso and he wasn't trying to hide and ignore it, he actually wanted to talk to Leo about what had happened and tell him how bad he feels about leaving her behind and forgetting to get the Gods to follow up on their promise. Which of course made it harder for Leo to hate him. But who can hate Percy? Lets be real here. [image error] It was really important to me to have Percy keep his I need to protect everyone while being goofy personality, for example when the Argo II is being attacked and all he does is do hand gestures to Jason and then runs to the side of the boat and dives right in. Another is when Frank, Hazel, Leo and him were fighting and he changed the whole plan to protect Hazel, thats the Percy everyone fell in love with, the boy who did anything to protect anyone. Again I'm going to mention Percy and the whole poison situation because its a really important part of this series which is being ignored. Percy\u2019s powers are intensifying, they are reaching a new level, he normally has so much more control over them but when he finds out Annabeth is leaving him to fight down in Ancient Sparta with Piper he destroys all the plumbing in the ship. Thats not what i call control. This also leads to when Percy is being poisoned, afterwards he told Jason that he was too afraid to control it after what had happened in Tarturus. He was afraid of what he could do. [image error] In Acropolis when he kisses Annabeth is beautiful and brought a tear to my eye but the cherry onto of the ice cream is when he tells her he loves her for the first time. It was perfect. But we cant slide past the part of how he helped raise Gaia because of a blood nose. A blood nose! That is so typically Percy!!! Ok so we have been told countless times that Percy will have to make a huge sacrifice. The idea of what it will be terrified me because its always been so hard for him to go against what he thinks is right. So when i found out that his big sacrifice was to let Piper, Jason and Leo go by themselves i was mad and i got furious when Annabeth goes Percy we need you help and he says ok and leaves. No! Thats not Percy, he would never do that, ever, he would just leave without a fight, it looked like he had not trouble at all saying no. It was such a disappointment. [image error] The best Percy moment for me which brought me back to the old days was when Nico tells Percy how he felt about him and Percy was so confused. I was pissing my pants!!!!! He is so precious and clueless its hilarious! Also where was the Sally and Percy reunion i have been waiting for, for five books??? WHERE IS IT? [image error] Ok, now its time to say goodbye to him, this is going to be hard especially that this wasn't my favourite book. None of my friends read Percy Jackson, none of them have had the pleasure of reading these books, not one of them can understand the attachment I have towards these books, they don't understand how much these books have changed many people. I know this sounds cheesy and stupid but its true. A lot of series i read have finished this year, like The mortal instruments, Divergent, Legend series and soon The Darkest Minds, none of them have made such a connection towards me emotionally, none of them have made me this devastated when it ended, I don't miss them as much as I already miss this world. Percy what can I say, you are by far my favourite character out of any book. I\u2019ve seen your constant struggle to understand the world you now live in, we have experienced you girl troubles, and by girl troubles i mean not knowing when someone likes you, we\u2019ve seen you have to make hard decisions and we have seen you become a hero. Though through all these hard times you have stayed you and i low that I'm acting like he is a real life person and all of you guys will be saying he's just a character, but i think i can speak for many people when i say he isn't just a fictional character. I can write for ages about what you mean to me but I can only say one thing. Thank you, I didn't want to be a half-blood but I didn't look back. [image error] Blackjack (BONUS!) He didn't die so I'm alright. [image error] [image error] ...more PRETTY DISAPPOINTED WITH HOW THIS WRAPPED.

Tumblr . Pinterest . Google . DeviantArt . Random Blogs . Instagram . Wikia . YouTube Any suggestions UPDATE AGAIN I was sent an message telling me that The \"storm or fire\"thing is most likely Leo because Jason one of the big three sons hence more important and because he is on the cover. Jason being on the cover doesn't mean he is home free it could be rick riordans tribute to his death.Also if you look closley at the cover Jason is falling to his death or straight into that giants hand <-- not a good scenario and by the looks of it that giant doesn't look like a vegetarian. Hopefully none of them die but if one of them has to well.......adios jason UPDATE OH *wheeze* MY *wheeze* LEO the cover is finally revealed I don't know what to feel Angry because Leo is not on the cover or Happy because this is as close to reading the book I will ever get until October.I am so confused which emotion should I choose. (view spoiler) [ That rhymed (hide spoiler) ] My sensitive heart can't control these feeling. On another note I heard thier were going to be \"deaths\" in this upcoming book and if you know whats good for you Ricky you won't kill of the following people 1.Leo valdez 2.Leo valdez 3.Leo valdez and last but not least Nico Di angelo because thier is a very scary fan girl threatening to do very bad things to me if i don't I Sabirina vow never to mess with Nicos fangirls and maybe OCTAVIAN should be added to the list For some reason after Re-reading The son of Neptune I found the power hungry,teddy bear killing, blue eyed manipulator kind of personality Smexy. BONUS:No ones fangirling over him except me. . **Comment on who you want added to the list another year Another year ANOTHER YEAR Think about this Rick Riordan as soon as your done writing Blood of Olympus i have no use for you any more and I will get payback on what you did to my feels.

It was soo good! After I finished it, I was SOO DAMN excited for the next book! But THEN, I saw The Blood of Olympus's publication date... OCTOBER 7TH 2014 Seriously?!?!?!? SERIOUSLY?!?!?!?! Rick Riordan, you do want your fans to be alive to actually read the book, right? I guess not. Are you REALLY gonna make us wait till OCTOBER 7TH 2014?!?!! FREAKIN' 2014!?!?! I am soo gonna die waiting. I mean it, cause.. After all the action and drama that happened in Ho House of Hades was just indescribable! It was soo good! After I finished it, I was SOO DAMN excited for the next book! But THEN, I saw The Blood of Olympus's publication date... OCTOBER 7TH 2014 Seriously?!?!?!? SERIOUSLY?!?!?!?! Rick Riordan, you do want your fans to be alive to actually read the book, right? I guess not. Are you REALLY gonna make us wait till OCTOBER 7TH 2014?!?!! FREAKIN' 2014!?!?! I am soo gonna die waiting. I mean it, cause.. After all the action and drama that happened in House of Hades, you're really gonna make us wait one WHOLE year?!?!?! I think I'm gonna die.. Well, it doesn't really matter what we say cause the book won't be released any faster. So.. I might as well right my predictions about it. Here goes... My predictions of The Blood Of Olympus--- Deaths. Loads of deaths. It's obvious that there are gonna be deaths. For a war to be won there has to be deaths. And even though I hate to admit it, I am one hundred percent sure that one of the seven chosen demigods.. will die. Cause a hero has to die. Otherwise the story will just seem tooo perfect. I'm just praying that it isn't Percy or Annabeth, cause even though I like the other characters, I Absolutely Love Percabeth. (Notice the capital letters? Yeah,I love them that much!) I almost cried at the end of The Mark Of Athena. But, I didn't cause I had the House of Hades already. I know, lucky me. I feel really sad for the fans who had to wait one whole year for it. I wonder how that felt...Well, I'm gonna find out now! But really, after all the things that Percy and Annabeth have gone through in all the books, SPECIALLY after all the things they have gone through together in Tartarus, I will be heartbroken if either one of them dies. But it doesn't matter how heartbroken I will be because, You cannot kill them. You cannot. CANNOT. C-A-N-N-O-T. Don't kill Leo either. Kill someone else. Kill Frank or Hazel instead. Sorry to all their shippers but I don't really like them that much. SO, if they do die, I'd be sad but not that much. But, our dear Rick *please note the sarcasm*, is known for giving lots of unexpected twists and turns. I am just praying that he does NOT , in a tragic turn of events let all the chosen seven live and instead kill Nico. Honestly, even after his secret was out, I still think he's a very strong demigod. And, I hope that he doesn't die. The Great Prophecy. \"Seven half-bloods shall answer the call\" --- The seven half-bloods have already been chosen. They are Percy, Annabeth, Jason, Piper, Leo, Frank and Hazel. Quite an unique pair. \"To storm or fire the world must fall\" --- Storm could mean either Jason or Percy or maybe even both of them together. Fire is most probably Leo. And here 'world' means Gaia, most probably. So, Gaia will be stopped, it's just a matter of what or whom she will be stopped by. \"An oath to keep with a final breath\" --- I have a mini heart attack everytime I think about this line. Cause someone's gonna die!!! And my mind is too busy hyperventilating right now to remember any of the oath made by any of the demigods. They all made promises though. Leo made one to Calypso. Please don't let Leo die. Percy made one to Annabeth. Please don't let Percy die. Nico made one to Percy. Please don't let Nico die. JUST DON'T KILL THEM PLEASE RICK!! I BEG YOU!!!! PLEASE DON'T KILL THEM!!!PLEASE!!! PRETTY PLEASE!!! PRETTY PLEASE WITH A CHERRY ON TOP!!! Well. Carrying on. \"And foes bear arms to the Doors of Death\" --- At first, I thought foes meant the Greeks and the Romans together. But, after reading House of Hades, I think a few Titans and Giants -maybe even monsters!- will turn good and help the demigods and the gods in defeating Gaia. The demigods will win the war. The demigods will win the war. Both the camps will fight together along with the help of the gods. I am abso-freakin-lutely sure about that. Cause after soo many books, if the fans don't get a happy ending, Rick is gonna be in trouble. But I'm pretty sure we'll get a happy ending. After all, we do trust the demigods, don't we? Percabeth. Percy and Annabeth will probably go back to camp together. Maybe they'll go to New Rome in Camp Jupiter if they can. Cause Percy did plan on living in New Rome with Annabeth. But then again, Annabeth wanted to stay in Camp Half-blood, didn't she? Let's just hope that the two camps won't be fighting with each other anymore after the war with the giants end. Maybe.. maybe the long-lasting rivalry between them will end. I don't care if Octavian has to die for it to happen. Kill him. See if I care. Jasper. Jason and Piper. Jason and Piper might stay in Camp Half-Blood cause they both seem to like it better than the Roman camp. It doesn't really matter to me what they do, I just wanna know what will happen with Percabeth. But, I do hope that Jason and Piper don't die. I like them a lot and if they died, it would be quite depressing. Frank and Hazel. I think I already expressed my opinion about them when I said that I wouldn't be that sad if they die. But, can you blame me? Frank is all big and Mars-y and all win-this-war type-y. And Hazel came back from the dead, and she didn't even know what chicken nuggets are!!! Caleo. I really hope that Leo and Calypso end up together. I am rooting for them!!! I never forget how Nemesis told Leo that he would always be the seventh wheel and I hated that she said that! Leo's so cool, he would never end up alone! So please please please please PLEASE let them end up together!! Happy ending. There's gonna be a happy ending. Maybe the camps will be situated closer to each other, even! And, I'm guessing that the gods will care more about the kids and be more 'interactive' with them and hopefully, it will all be for the best! Oh Damn. Now I just want the books more. I'm pretty sure that Rick's just sitting there all like, Rick... GIVE ME THE BOOK ALREADY!!!! I NEED THE DAMN BOOK NOW!!! GIVE IT TO ME ALREADY!!! UPDATE: I HAVE FINALLY FINISHED READING THIS BOOK The wait was very long. It was painful, really. But then, I kinda got over the hype. You can't blame me for waiting two more years to read this. I read the other nine in one go and then I have to wait a year?? Then school got in the way and all that jazz BUT HEY, I'm finally done with this series! I'm really going to miss the characters a lot and just everything about this series. Honestly, this book did not meet my expectations. The demigods did a great job, as always, but everything was just too... perfect? Every obstacle that was thrown in their way, they overcame it somehow. AND DON'T GET ME WRONG, that's a good thing, it's great! But, come on. They're seven demigods fighting against so many giants! They even wake up Gaia but the gods decide to swoop in, literally , at exactly that point?? Maybe I've grown up too much since the last book? Or I just expected too much from the final book in the series? I don't exactly know why I was disappointed. But BoO didn't get four stars for nothing. There was a lot of development among the characters. They had gotten so used to fighting side by side, sometimes they didn't need words. Percabeth and Jasper were as cute as before, if not even more adorable. I even grew a liking towards Frank and Hazel! I didn't think much of Reyna before but I somewhat respected her in this book. She's been through so much and she's still so strong. Really hoping that whatever Aphrodite said wasn't right. I was glad that Leo could make it back to Calypso but I was wondering how? You could only go to that island once, right? What bothered me more was that Calypso was literally standing there with her bags packed. It was eh, cute, but not the kind of ending that I had wanted. But, I'm not even sure about what I want anymore... AND NICO. MY BABY. I have so so so much love for him. He didn't have to take the responsibility to take back the Athena Parthenon but HE DID IT ANYWAY. I was so scared that he was going to die, I was just waiting for it. Buuuut, it never came and I couldn't have been happier. Oh, is Will gay? Will and Nico seemed very rushed, to be honest. Octavian's death was very expected. No feelings about that, to be honest. He just wasn't right in the head. I guess my favourite scene was when Annabeth and Piper went to that temple of fear and panic. For once, Annabeth's plans were of no use and Piper really proved herself. She didn't try to be logical, she let her emotions take over and she saved them both! If anyone still thought that Piper was a harmless daughter of Aphrodite who couldn't fight, they would be proven WRONG. Really loved that scene. And the entire book, I guess. But it just felt like something was missing! Anyway, I do hope the gods keep their word this time and is it okay if I hope for more books about the demigods? Yes? Yes? OKAY! For anyone still hesitating to read this book, I'd tell you to give it a shot. The entire series is great and the fandom too. The fans are amazing people and I've made so many friends in this fandom, gosh, I don't want this to end!! ...more *Buddyread with the Awesome Mac .* (You can click her name for her review.^^) \u201cTo storm or fire the world must fall.

I have never really tried writing real reviews for these books because whenever I read them, I usually deactivate my critical reading skills and just simply enjoy them because that\u2019s one thing always true about these books- they are simply enjoyable. For the same reason, the following wouldn\u2019t be a real review, just a sort of tribute to the series, the author and of course the characters. Let me do it the Harry Potter style so it\u2019s going to be a bit longer than usual so please bear with me. Thank you. ^^ Uncle Ricky, you really should thank the gods that I (and thousands, perhaps millions of your followers) love you. Because if we don\u2019t, you could just think of the million ways we could ask the gods to punish you for always, always slapping our faces with your infamous cliffhangers. It\u2019s the series ender for Mother Gaia\u2019s sake and you still end it with a cliffy! But endless thanks to your exemplary creativity, topnotch humor (hats off to you for that Hunger Games reference) and unbelievable imagination for recreating these popular Greek and Roman myths and making them a hundred times more awesome and more enjoyable. My journey with this series is a hundred times better than my mythology class in college. Percy Jackson , of all the demigods, I have become attached to you the most. You can\u2019t blame me because I\u2019ve been questing with you since your first Percy Jackson series. It was a privilege to witness your growth in character and strength in power.

He's a safe author for one, and this is middle-grade we're talking about. Harry Potter stopped being middle-grade four books ago, so don't you go shoving The Battle of Hogwarts in my face. Let's not focus on the bad. Let's focus on the good. More specially, female friendships . It's easy to create an Action Girl caricature like Katsa from Graceling , but a hell lot harder to create numerous female characters that are truly friends, not props like in most Paranormal Romances. It's such a huge part of feminist fiction, and The Heroes of Olympus series has that in spades. We could've had the catty, body-shaming love triangles between Reyna, Jason, and Piper; and Reyna, Percy, and Annabeth, and for a while, it looked like it was heading down that road. But the girls got over it. They grew to respect each other's strength and help one another. Piper even soothed Reyna's worries on romance. Reyna is the shit. Remember when I bitched about the resolving of a love triangle through another love in Dreams of Gods & Monsters ? Jesus, that's creepy. Yeah, that doesn't happen here. Reyna had a crush on Jason, then Percy, then... no one. She doesn't get paired off. She gets through heartbreak via time, space, and acceptance instead of replacing him with another guy. She did all this while lugging a giant, murderous magic statue across states and being pursued by enemies. Can I get a hand for my girl? Harry Potter gifs! Harry Potter gifs everywhere! Nico's ending was lovely. (view spoiler) [Will was a bit out of the blue, but who cares. I just want Nico to be happy and walk in the sun with Will. His getting over Percy wasn't too unexpected. Percy was one to introduce Nico to Camp Half-Blood in the first place, so he became an anchor for Nico. When Nico discovered he belonged in the end, he could finally let Percy go. Though I wish we could've gotten one last Percy POV for Nico's confession. That would've been sick. (hide spoiler) ] Percy and Annabeth didn't have big roles and honestly, that pleased me. They got their spotlight in the five-book series Percy Jackson & the Olympians, and the previous three installments of this series. Percy narrates Percy Jackson's Greek Gods and the upcoming Percy Jackson's Greek Heroes . Jeez, I love Percy just as much as the next fan, but enough! Let the other demigods have a chance to shine. With that being said, no more sequels, Riordan. You got your companion pieces, short story collections, graphic novels... Anymore and you might turn into Cassie Clare. Love you, dahling!

Frank is going to die. His life is tied to a frigging STICK. Not to mention the whole \"To storm or fire thing\" His sense of duty is so much stronger than Percy, who's fatal flaw is loyalty. My guess is that someone is going to jeopardize some plan which is going to make Annabeth get into mortal danger. I wouldn't be surprised if Percy is vital to defeating the giants, but because Annabeth is in danger, he tries to go off and save her. Because Frank has his sense of duty, he'll sacrifice himself to the greater good. Again, these are all random speculations 2. This relates to the prophesy above. If Frank dies, then my guess is that Hazel will die again and then they'll be together. Technically, Nico broke the rules by bringing her back to life, but Gaea also broke that rule by opening the Doors of Death. I'm guessing that to make things completely right, Hazel has to return to the Underworld. And if Frank dies, then they'll both be happy. More to come, I'll edit later. EDIT March 3rd 2014 Less than a year you guys! More predictions 3. Leo makes some deal with Gaia that sacrifices himself and saves the the others. BUT this deal will *hopefully* somehow make him end up with Calypso. I don't think Riordan is quite that mean to finally give Leo a love interest but doesn't let Leo ever see her again. 4. Percy ends up with Annabeth living in the Roman camp. This is one of those speculation ones that could end up either way. I feel like Riordan is setting it up for Percy to be the leader of both camps. Also, you can tell that Annabeth really wants to live in the Roman Camp 5. Reyna dies. These kinds of books always have one character already labelled for death and I'm sad to say that Riordan is given Reyna that label. I feel like killing Reyna will solve several problems. These kinds of books always have to have that noble sacrifice. But Reyna also has created some messy strings that Riordan's going to have to cut. Like I said, I feel like Riordan is trying to move Percy into a position where he's kind of an overseer for both camps, I'm sure he'll give Frank(if he lives) or Jason the job as the second Praetor.

Leo : He was funny at first but eventually turned into the Deus ex Machina mechanic, nothing more. Reyna and Nico, on the other hand, were the real heroes of the book. Nico : Flawed in the best way. He's like one of those candies that are hard on the outside but gooey and sweet on the inside <3 my favorite! Reyna : A queen and a true leader - she lends her strength to lesser peers.

I really don't like Leo. I just can't connect with him, and he easily annoys me. It took me years to finish this series, but I'm happy I finally did it.

Pessimistic theory: (which will not actually happen because Frank is not supposed to die unless he's holding the stick): Jason betrays them and Piper charmspeaks him into drowning himself, and then dramatically jumps in after him. Leo accidently burns up Hazel (and therefore The Stick and Frank), goes insane with grief and goes on a burning rampage and kills everyone else, except Percy and Annabeth. Percy extinguishes all the fire with his water, Leo comes to his senses and kills himself. Percy sacrifices himself to deafeat Gaia. After the war is won, Annabeth throws herself off a cliff. Then, somehow, Gaia comes back (again) and destroys all human civilization. Realistic theory: Leo stays behind to close the doors of death/takes Hazels place, Reyna sacrifices herself somehow, we have Jasper, Frazel and Percabeth, Gaia is defeated and nearly everyone lives mostly happily ever after. Who's excited! Edit: Wow, I'm actually kind of ashamed at how anti-Jason this review is. Over the year since Mark of Athena came out, I came to appreciate Jason, and I like him a lot after House of Hades.

Deus ex machina, literally So in the final battle with Gaea, the Olympians just kinda shoot out of the sky to finally help their kids. It\u2019s not clear why they are now about to come to the aid of the heroes and not all the other times they were needed. Another thing that ticked me off was that Leo lived because of that Physician\u2019s Cure when the prophecy said one would die. It\u2019s a complete cop out and takes away from the gravity of the situation. This book really boils down to 2 characters: Leo and Nico Leo Annoying Leo, who is always a 7th wheel saves the day and gets Calypso. While he could be a great character to get children interested in engineering, I find he is mostly the comic relief geek. You can tell Riordan really wanted to put a spotlight on him in this book and make him a real hero, but he just doesn\u2019t really get there. Leo is always left wanting for more, and so is the audience. The author wrote himself into a corner by giving Leo that belt and all those tools, but it begs the question: Nico Oh, Nico. I would have liked to have said you were an interesting character before your revelation in the last book, but I\u2019d be lying. Hazel is better in every way, and she\u2019s not even some emo kid. While it\u2019s great that Hades turns out to be an honorary PFLAG member, I feel that Riordan missed a large opportunity with having an (implicit) LGBT character turn into a stereotype that only cares about appearances. He loses his crush on Percy as soon as he sets his eyes on Will, and starts obsessing over redecorating the Hades cabin. Is that really the image you want young readers to see, Riordan? That LGBT youth are either really depressed (and one could infer suicidal as well, since Nico is the son of Hades\u2026) or extremely vapid? Here was a big chance to show inclusivity and depth, but it\u2019s wasted on a poor characterization. SMH. Although the author has gotten lighter with the lame dad jokes, he still manages to toss in a few cringe-worthy attempts at humor. At one point Zeus manages to reference Seinfeld : (P.440) There is also so much overuse of \"onager\", which got on my nerves with how every other paragraph towards the end of the book was peppered with it. Although this book weighs in at just over 500 pages, it's fast-paced (if not confusing and breakneck at times). It's an entertaining, though not completely satisfying conclusion to the series. ...more *3.5* ERMEGERD. That ending messed me uppppppp. Kind of a cop out though.

THE LAST QUEST OF THE SEVEN AWESOMESAUCE HEROES that we have come to know for so many years. Can you guys even believe it's been YEARS?? Gosh darn it! 10th Nov. 2013 So, I've Read the House of Hades yesterday. Is it unfair that i want this book RIGHT NOW??? Pre-Reading Review You know when i first heard the name of the book, the first thing that went into my mind was 'That sounds.... bad ' Well, since the book is definitely not coming since next year's fall (I know, TORTURE!), i've decided to predict a bit about the next book, as well as my expectations. 1. About the Prophecy of Seven Seven Half-Bloods Shall Answer The Call Duh! Seven demigods, now heading to Athens, who have answered the challenge by Gaia and her now~all~of~them~alive~and~haughty Giants. To Storm Or Fire The World Must Fall Hmm...Storm could mean either Jason or Percy or both of them combined and Fire could only mean Leo. The world as i've already thought(i swear i knew this could happen before HoH) could be Gaia. But as piper is guessing, if Gaia would fall by one, then the other one would die (Lets hope that does NOT happen). The 'fire' could also be somehow related to Frank's wooden-stick. An Oath To Keep With A Final Breath I can only guess now that its the Leo's oath on the River Styx that he'd take out Calypso from her prison island. Aside from that, there have been made some promises, but not oaths . About the final breath. You know, i have this faint guess that this either means that Leo might become an immortal (meaning his last 'mortal' breath) OR Calypso becoming mortal (Calypso's last 'immortal' breath). If Calypso became mortal, her island might get destroyed, but she'll be able to leave Ogygia because she won't be a nymph anymore (she's called the Queen of nymphs in greek mythology) And Foes Bear Arms To The Doors Of Death Foes....at first we thought it was about Romans and Greeks that they'll keep aside their animosity and together close the doors of death. But in the House of Hades, we met a really really good Giant and Titan. And they helped closing the doors of death. So, I'm still confused over the fact that the fourth line of the prophecy has already been fulfilled.. For obvious reasons you can never ever trust prophecies ( especially prophecies on Rick Rioridan books :D) till the story ends (remember the Last Olympian?!). But anyways these are my guesses. So lets just sit here waiting for the prophecy to happen.. 2. Just had a thought. I think When we're gonna reach the most crucial part, its gonna be really really intense. Something that make the seven demigods think 'We're SOO gonna be killed RIGHT NOW!' Like Percy and Jason be like And The Seven are Like See? Getting the image? OH Come On! THIS IS SO GONNA HAPPEN! 3. Leo and Calypso reunion - YOU BETTER BRING IT ON RICK!!!! We really, really need a Happy Ending, atleast for those two! I have my fingers totally crossed for this! 4. Nico's happy ending (50% chance) - *sniffle* Don't you just *sniff* miss the Happy Little Nico? Ok, i know he Wont be the same happy-kid-nico like EVER, but if he has to face more problems which will make him bitter all the time I'm gonna personally write a letter to the Fates up there with written on it 'STOP RUINING HIS LIFE!!!!' Now i know, most of you think Nico will be happy once he gets a boyfriend yada yada yada....and i'm sitting here thinking Seriously? . Tell me honestly, do you need to be in a relationship to be happy?? No! If Nico is upset and angry, having a relationship ISN'T the ONLY solution! I just...wanna see him happy, like he must feel happy and contended. Please Jason, help the kid! Or maybe coach...uh ok not the coach. 5. Mellie & Baby - DEFINITELY GONNA SEE THEM! IM 100% sure about it. See? Here's my written guarantee here! 6. Parents & Demigods Reunion - Obviously, since it is hinted that Gods and Demigods would be fighting together, the Godly Parents would be having this 'meeting' with their children. Im SOOO excited for this. Also, to Rick- If you're somehow reading this(by any luck of mine)- I'll offer you burnt foods for offering, sacrifice Teddy Bears...or anything you want, but PLEASE just make this reunion of Sally Jackson with Percy, Frederick Chase with Annabeth, and other mortal-parents meeting their Children. ESPECIALLY Sally Jackson & Percy! Just thinking about this reunion is seriously making me lurch and cry from inside. We really really need to see this :*( 7. Bad Bad Monsters!!!! Well duh! Epic finale needs epic Monsters who wont just gloat but fight pretty well too, like almost kill demigods to shreds! Special Emphasis on 'Almost' :D. Which brings me to next prediction.. 8. Death Why Why Why Is it So obvious??? I just DON'T want ANYONE to die Exceot Octavian (that son of a gorgon!). But i think someone important is definitely gonna die, most likely one of the seven in the prophecy. And you know who i think is gonna die? Hazel or Frank or Jason, EVEN though they're my favorite characters! No, not only them, All of the seven are my favorite!! But SOMEONE's DEFINITELY GONNA DIE!!! *cries in a corner* Damn the feels! And just so you know i don't know how to use all the 'gifs' reference but thanks for reading that mess :D. ...more Tengo sentimientos encontrados con este final y con el libro en general.

I've been following the Percy Jackson series for about four and a half years. In fact this series is one of the reasons I really started reading in the first place. It's a pretty long story that involves way more time than I have space to write, but the general idea is that this series means a lot to me and it has for some time. So, reading The Blood of Olympus my standards of quality were through the roof. And though my expectations weren't crushed, they weren't met either. And since I have a lot of complaints, I'll start with the good things. The second I learned that this book was including a Nico and Reyna point of view I thought it was doomed. So I was happily surprised by how much I enjoyed their parts. Nico and Reyna formed an unlikely friendship and I found their banter really sweet and unique. These two were able to bond in such strange ways and it was fun to see the growth of their friendship. If I was to pick a favorite of the two, it would be Reyna. As much as I liked Nico and enjoyed seeing the extent of his power, I felt that I learned far more about Reyna and how she changed as a person. One of my favorite parts of the book took place on the boat with the pegisi and Orion. Reyna's moment of selflessness was really empowering and it felt like an important moment of self discovery for her. It was one of the few scenes that reminded me of the previous books. Piper was another great character and it makes me sad that people think she needs to prove herself when she has a thousand times over. Her instincts and fighting skills are incredible. Piper was a key character to keeping the crew relaxed and optimistic. It bothers me that people think she isn't allowed to be kind and strong at the same time. As for the ending with Leo, I'm conflicted. I do like their romance, but it felt abrupt to me. The entire book seemed a bit week and unfinished. Overall the book was enjoyable enough, but it didn't feel like a proper conclusion. I think Riordan could have really benefited from a longer deadline. On the negative side, I think Riordan set up more than he could handle. I know writing for seven main characters (or nine including Reyna and Nico) is not an easy task. Which is why in most of the books only some characters had a main focus, but that doesn't leave the reader feeling any less disconnected from the characters who aren't in the spotlight. I really missed Frank and Hazel and found the focus of Jason, Piper, and Leo a bit... unnecessary. Though I understand that it is essentially their story I don't understand the point of alienating the other characters to the extent he did. I felt that some characters acted differently when written through another characters eyes. Certain dialogue felt more like the character narrating than the one speaking and it was frustrating. None of the characters felt as unique as they had in the past. To me a lot of their personalities seemed to blend together in this last book. Though I did like Jason in this book, it seemed as if Riordan was trying really hard to prove his worth to the audience. I like Jason. I don't like him as much as I like the other characters, but I do like him. However, the fact that his legacy was \"him carrying on what Percy failed to finish\" felt really... last minute... I understand all gods should be recognized, but it felt like something all seven of them should have realized on their quest. Not just Jason. I just feel like Jason's journey to self confidence was really weak and lacking. Also by making the goddess of storms more powerful doesn't that put both mortals and demigods at risk of dangerous shipwrecks? I think Riordan must have abandoned some of his original plots for the series due to the lack of time. Though we do know what happens to all of the important characters, there isn't that feeling of closure. This is something really important that original series had and this one didn't. This book was lacking the feeling of togetherness that books 1 - 3 had. The first three books were well written, well edited, and they flowed perfectly. Book five was sort of a, \"Crap the series is ending and I only have a year I guess I'll just throw it together,\" novel. You can tell Riordan worked really hard on this conclusion, but I don't think it was shown the came care and thought that the other books were. The build-up really led to almost nothing. Percy's fatal flaw played such a minor role, Frank's lifeline plot was abandoned almost entirely, and the way to kill Gaea was to just fly her into the sky? It was too simple. I was also very bothered by the personalities of the gods in this book. Everyone seemed to fit their cookie cutter image more than their 3-dimensional personalities Riordan had brought me to appreciate and love. Back to the point of there being nine demigods rather than seven: I can't help but feel this wasn't how Riordan originally planned the story. It's a five book series, of course his ideas were going to change over time, but the prophecy was barely even a guideline by the end, and I have to say that really does bother me. In my opinion the real turning point for the series was the fall into Tartarus. The way book 3 ended was spectacular and I absolutely loved it. The Mark of Athena is probably the best book in the series, if not one of the best books he has ever written. But a lot of times when an author creates such an emotional and shocking ending, they trap themselves in a corner. I've encountered this multiple times in my reading travels and almost every time the author has dug a hole they can't get themselves out of. Some examples of these types of endings, in my opinion, would be books like Delirium and Insurgent . On their own they're incredible, but they make it really difficult to continue with the series. Overall The Blood of Olympus was a real let down for me and the more I'm away from it the more I'm disappointed. I can't say that I'm shocked since I was already seeing a change in his writing in The House of Hades, but it makes me sad that such an amazing series had such an unsatisfactory ending. It was generally boring and felt pointless at times. It lacked the creativity that I've always loved about his writing and I find the quality of the book to be really inexcusable, especially as a conclusion. Also note that even though this review is mostly negative, I mean no disrespect to the author or to any readers who enjoyed it! I was just personally very disappointed and thought I would share my thoughts. I originally wrote this review when I completed the book after it's release, but have since edited it as my thoughts changed. Thanks for reading! ...more WELL. That , my friends, is how a conclusion should be done! HUZZAH THAT RICK RIORDAN IS SUCH A GENIUS. And also knows how to mix heartache with humour and danger with excitement and dragons with talking tables. I mean, really. This dude. I am in awe. And, so far, I've found this series a bit waffly (and not the foodie kind) and rambly, but for the finale? NOPE. Perfection. Everything was balanced and I found myself just gobbling up pages like a Hades on fire. Of course the characters are 95% of t WELL. That , my friends, is how a conclusion should be done!

Everything was balanced and I found myself just gobbling up pages like a Hades on fire. Of course the characters are 95% of the reason I love this series. They're so DYNAMIC. And funny. And cute. And shippable. And I was so so happy with how it all concluded. A bit o' tragedy, a bit o' sweetness. YES I SHALL GRIN LIKE A RAUCUOS PINEAPPLE. But just quickly, let us peer individually at our favourite fruit salads: + Percy: I was a bit disappointed that he didn't have any POV chapters. They're always my favourite . In fact, I think he took really much of a backseat in this book and that's like my only complaint. + Annabeth: See above. WAH. I mean, I know they had tons of POV time in Mark of Athena, etc, buuuut...I would never say no to more of Annabeth's snark and brains. + Jason: Okay, I KNOW I said at the beginning he was my least favourite, but omg, he's grown on my like a loyal barnacle. I like Jason now! He's loosened up a little and is more easy-going and I didn't even mind that the finale focused on him a lot. + Piper: She features a lot in this one too. (It's like a Jason/Piper/Nico feature, tbh.) She has SERIOUSLY CHARMSPEAK SKILLZ. THAT IS ALL. + Frank: Frank didn't POV either, and I love Frank so this was sad. But he did turn into a bulldog when he got frightened and that was funny. + Hazel: Seriously I don't even know what Hazel was doing half the time?? Eating waffles? Who could know. + Leo: OMG LEO MY DARLING BABY AND FAVOURITEST OF ALL THE 7. LET ME JUST HUG YOU AND SAY YOU HAVE FRIENDS. HE is so funny and has such terrible self-worth and his love for Calypso was endlessly cute. I just love Leo's inventions and spunkiness and the way he can't sit still. ALTHOUGH HE KEEPS SOME TERRIBLE SECRETS IN THIS BOOK AND I MAYBE NEED TO SMACK HIM. (view spoiler) [I knew he wouldn't die either! I kind of though maaaybe...? But then Rick Riordan doesn't seem like the murder-everyone's-favourites kind of guy, so I wasn't surprised that Leo reappeared to sweep Calypso off her feet. Though Leo SUCKS for not telling his friends asap that he was alive. (hide spoiler) ] + Nico: AHHHH NICO!!! OMG. HE IS WONDERFUL. He and Leo are my favourites (but, well, I love Percabeth. Omg, stop making me choose.) But Nico had some serious POV time and a lot of development and it was just adorable to see him grow and get a (view spoiler) [crush on another camper other than Will! BAHHHHHH I DIED LAUGHING WHEN HE CAME OUT TO PERCY AND ANNABETH. I died , I tell you. I actually hit myself in the face with the book I was laughing so hard. (hide spoiler) ] It was glorious. I'm so glad it was funny too! AND EXCITING. I love Percy and Jason's \"oh bro\" moments. And I liked how they wrapped up loose ends and kept you guessing and dreading. Basically it was glorious and probably my favourite out of the series (although Mark of Athena. C'MON THAT WAS INCREDIBLE). I'm kind of sad it's finished now though...awk. What now? Kane Chronicles?

I suppose now it's time to bid Percy Jackson and his friends farewell. I've been on this adventure since I was ten, back when my friends convinced me to start the series. Gods, I started this series before I even started Harry Potter! It's kind of hard to let go of Percy Jackson, though, you know? I've grown to love the characters so much, even the ones I wasn't so fond of in the beginning. The character development was phenomenal. Our beloved characters never failed with their wit and humor. We can always relive these adventures, but it still feels like we're saying goodbye. But we can always count on Rick Riordan, an amazing author, to bring us more adventures. We still have books to look forward to, guys. And now I'm going to go cry myself to sleep. ***** I just finished HoH. Wow. Wow. Just... Wow. *high pitched shriek* I can't wait!!! ...more H.Y.P.E.R.V.E.N.T.I.L.A.T.I.N.G. THIS IS IT. This is it, guys. The end of Percy Jackson. The end of my life. I'm not sure how I'll be able to read this without sobbing hysterically after every page. I just don't think I can do it. I CAN'T LET GO. WAHHHHHHHHHHH Ah. I can't believe it's over.

And after reading multiple of comments that I've received on my blog, I think I feel like I have a little more to say along with this review (which is wayyyyy below). Please note these are just my thoughts. Firstly, I get that everyone found the ending too open-ended. But, I don't really see it in a way that it annoys me. I liked how it was open ended because he gave us the opportunity to use our imagination to predict what happens next. Obviously, Leo's gonna go back to find the others. We know what Percabeth is planning to do for the next 4 years, but obviously it's not going to be peaceful--they're half-bloods. They're gonna \"fight stuff\" (quoting what Percy said in BoO there). Rick didn't give us an ending that closed the doors, and I appreciate that. Secondly, I've come to somewhat agree on how the ending was rushed. There was so much build up to this war with Gaia but then they defeat her in the matter of one or two chapters. It happened wayyyyy too quickly, and I did expect something \"grander\" if you will. Thirdly, I see what everyone is saying about the lack of Percy/Annabeth/Frank/Hazel. I absolutely understand why, it's because this is HoO, not PJO anymore. So Percy and Annabeth are as significant as the others like Jason/Piper/Nico/Leo/Reyna. Percy and Annabeth had an important plot line in the first 4 books. From being separated because of Hera, then finding each other, then falling into Tartarus. But they don't have anything like that in this book, there's no separate part they play anymore, so having Percy/Annabeth not as much in this book was understandable, even though my fangirl heart sobs. What I don't get is Frank/Hazel. I mention this in my proper review below, too. There was so much development for them in HoH, and they kinda just lost that in this book. Despite these small criticisms, I'm not lowering my rating, because I'm a mood reader and this book made me feel so ineffably happy and sad and everything. It's a book that made me feel like 5 stars, and so that's what it's gonna get. (hide spoiler) ] This review has ALL The Blood of Olympus spoilers hidden under spoiler tags. For people who have not read The House of Hades, please only read the first and last paragraphs. I cried last night after finishing The Blood of Olympus. I had ran from school straight to the closest bookstore and snagged the book. I might have squealed and flailed a bit, and maybe a few people in passing stared at me weirdly, but\u00a0this goes down as one of my happiest moments of 2014. As did The House of Hades last year. I live for these books: no joke, I\u00a0thought and fangirled over The Blood of Olympus pretty much at least once a day over the past year. Don't believe me? Ask my mum, it was probably her happiest day yesterday as well, because I finally stopped with the fangirling and was hidden away in my room all evening devouring this monster. Honestly, can't blame her. The reason I cried wasn't because of anything apart from the slow realisation that the Percy Jackson series have\u00a0completely\u00a0come to an end. The Blood of Olympus is\u00a0the last story from these demigods' that we're gonna get. (Well, for now at least.) It totally saddens me, because I've been infatuated with this demigod world for so long and well... I NEVER WANT TO LEAVE. I WANT THE BOOKS TO CONTINUE FOREVER. Alas, that can't happen. The bright side is that fandoms exist so everyone can sob together and we can all go visit Camp Half-Blood and Camp Jupiter in our dreams. This being said, I think the series ended on a very satisfactory note, the doors aren't closed tight shut. Rick Riordan leaves a satisfying ending but also one that gives us readers plenty of room for imagination. I'd say it's an open ending in the sense that it still ties up all the loose ends, if that makes any sense. The Blood of Olympus follows our 7 demigods as they must go and stop Gaia from rising as well as battle the giants that Gaia has set into the world. On the other hand we have Reyna, Nico and Coach Hedge who must return the Athena Parthenos back to Long Island in order to stop the Camp Half-Blood and Camp Jupiter from starting a war between them. And, the must all do this before the Feast of Spes, which is on August 1st, just twelve days away. Percy and Annabeth take the back seat in The Blood of Olympus, my Percabeth half of my heart sobbed endlessly, but it felt suiting that the others got some more shine time. Besides, The Heroes of Olympus isn't just a Percy Jackson book like the first series, the spin-off series is about all of the 7 demigods: Frank, Hazel, Leo, Piper, Jason as well as Percy and Annabeth. Here, we also get to see what's going on from Nico and Reyna's point of view, which was just so exciting. All the characters were developed fantastically, and with what looks to be an overwhelming amount of characters, if you gave me a piece of dialogue, I could name exactly who said it because that's just how distinct and thoroughly\u00a0constructed\u00a0Rick Riordan's characters are. Leo is certainly a highlight, his humour is brilliant, and the scenes where he is with Percy? Guys, it's priceless. I need to have more of these two dudes, they had me snorting and chocking on air because they're just that damn funny. My only quibble, mind you--VERY SMALL QUIBBLE lies with Frank and Hazel. I adored them in The House of Hades but their relationship and them as individuals, didn't have much development in here. I wanted more from Frank and Hazel, because they didn't seem to have as much of an importance in here. Jason and Piper? Well, let's just say I like them a more than I did in the previous instalments. It's never been a problem that I don't like them, it's just that Piper said that Jason was better than Percy in a previous book, WHICH IS SO NOT TRUE and Jason...well he's disliked by association. But, because we got both their' POVs in The Blood of Olympus, I found myself appreciating them more than before, though that doesn't mean I like them. Okay, next bit is about Nico, which I've hidden under spoiler tags. (view spoiler) [OMFG GUYS. So happy that Nico found Will. They're so beautiful already and I cried when he was told Percy that he had a crush on him once. So bloody proud of Nico and so freaking happy that he found someone, finally. Even though it's not with me. But like, the poor dude needs someone. And Will is possibly the best choice ever. Will= all bright and happy because he's the son of the Sun god and then you have Nico who is dark and seriously needs so light in his life. *squeals* *happy sighs* (hide spoiler) ] Action in this book was never-ending. You can never possibly be bored in a Rick Riordan book. If you have, are we even reading the same book? Actually, scrap that. Are we even living on the same universe? It's impossible, between the humour, the action, the plot and the fabulous characters, who can get bored? I was sitting upright in my bed pretty much talking to the characters on the page. You could say I was completely infatuated. We need to talk about the ending. The ending was glorious. (view spoiler) [OH MY GODS LEO. MY CALEO HAPPENED MY LIFE IS SATISFIED SO I FORGIVE RICK RIORDAN FOR THE LACK OF PERCABETH-NESS IN THIS BOOK. (Even though when they were talking about their future in New Rome, my fangirl heart went craaaaazy.) It was beautiful, so so beautiful. (hide spoiler) ] The Blood of Olympus was absolutely fantastic, the characters were as kick-ass and witty as ever, and the plot line kept me flicking the pages as fast as I could. It might look like a HUGE novel, but it flew by quickly. Maybe too quickly. I still want more *cries* Everything that you need in a flawless book is all in here. To all those who haven't read Percy Jackson, YOU NEED TO READ THIS SERIES. It's so worth it, and you haven't lived until you have. Then, once you start reading the series, tell me so we can be friends again. --------- FINISHED!

So there. ------------------------- REVIEW Do you detect a slightly sulky note in my rather abrupt book summary? Yes, I am a tad miffed. Disgruntled. And not a very happy Camp Half-Blood camper. REASONS WHY I AM BREATHING FESTUS FIRE : 1) No Percy Jackson POV. No Annabeth Chase POV. No Hazel Levesque POV. No Frank Zhang POV. Rick Riordan, you just denied me the mental upheavels of my four favourite and most loved characters. How could you? HOW COULD YOU?!? 2) Piper McLean's POV Really? REALLY?!? 3) Piper McLean is a better strategist than Annabeth Chase . In which twisted, soul-seared, brain-addled world is Annabeth helpless? Annabeth Chase . Annabeth Chase, daughter of Athena. Annabeth Chase who fought beside Percy Jackson to defeat the titan Kronos. Annabeth Chase who was the first ever child of Athena to survive and reclaim the Athena Parthenos from the clutches of her deadliest enemy, Arachne. Annabeth Chase who fell into Tartarus and returned. To fight on. And she can't face FEAR and PANIC?!!!! REALLLY?! OH MY GREEK GODS, Riordan. HOW COULD YOU? 4) Nico di Angelo's change of heart *humph* and also *p-shaw*. How does gloomy, angry, pain-ridden Nico, who has allowed his unrequited love for Percy Jackson to colour his entire existence, suddenly decide to move on? \"Percy Jackson makes corny jokes. I don't like him. Let's move on and find Solace elsewhere.\" Yeah, not buying that. Not buying that even if it comes with a free gift. Nico diAngelo is the orginal goth-emo child of the Grand Poobah of goth-emo, Hades. What he felt for Percy was a blend of respect, awe, hero-worship and undeniable love. It wasn't a mere crush. It wasn't a fly by night emotion ( gaa...unintended pun ). It was a love that could have made or destroyed the world. It was an epic twist and one of the main reasons why I couldn't wait to lay my hands on the last instalment. We all knew there would be heartbreak involved. The scene between Jason and Nico when they encounter Cupid back in The House of Hades captured so much of Nico's angst and helplessness. It laid the groundwork for Nico's struggle. Sadly, in this instalment, it fizzled out like a damp squib. You don't just emo and then not emo. Sorry. No. 5) No Frank Zhang awesomeness Frank Zhang didn't transform from a baby faced, self-doubting demigod to a ripped fighting machine just to act as everyone's handy shapeshifting mode of transport. You don't do that to a son of Ares. AND Gaia never thought of exploiting Zhang's one fatal weakness? Never? Not once? Grrr. 6) No Hazel Levesque brilliance. I love Hazel Levesque. I have burst with motherly pride whenever Hazel Levesque has blanketed her aches and pains and moved like a fiery heroine. I have rooted for Levesque through thick and thin, between Frank and Leo, atop Arion and off it. How could you not give me more Hazel time? How? I PROTEST! And I will cuss louder than Arion, I tell you. 7) Leo Valdez Now what's my problem with my favourite spark-plug? He saved the world didn't he? But I don't know why....the vintage Valdez touch was missing. Leo Valdez hid a world of insecurity behind his quick quips and mechanical genius. His jokes were silly but he always made me smile. But here....it all sounded a bit too contrived. Even Leo's epic moment wasn't a big surprise. I feel short changed. Don't ask me why. 8) Not enough Tyson-Ella time I love Tyson and Ella. I wanted to read more about them. But I got nothing. 9) Gaia's return Gaia's return was supposed to be the stuff of nightmares. Epically scary. Scarily epic. Yeah, this is an accurate representation. But the thing that really gets my Satyr is, 10) Percy Jackson being pushed to the sidelines You cannot place a sentence like \"PERCY JACKSON'S FINAL BATTLE BEGINS\" on the cover of a book and then treat him like an also-ran. You don't sidetrack the most powerful demigod in recent times. I understand the concept of seven half-bloods fighting unitedly to battle Gaia. I understand the aspect of not letting their individual egos and past victories get in the way of presenting a united front. I get it. I do. But this is ol'Seaweed Brain that we are talking about. He is the lodestone around which the rest of the new demigods are shaped and developed. He is the prime reason why a massive wave of the fandom has loyally stuck to this genre. The Son of Neptune may have been \"his book\" but when it comes to the crunch, we expect the freakishly awesome powers, the humility and the kindness of Percy Jackson to shine through. Above all, we expect his one fatal flaw to come into play: Loyalty to the people he loves. For about Percy Jackson, it had been said: To save his friends, Percy would let the world burn. That was the moment I was waiting for. The epic moment when Percy Jackson...perfect Percy Jackson will make an impossible decision. But, I had a flashback to this scene: Percy got a mental whack too. Nothing happened. I am very very angry. I am very Smaug-like in my anger right now. I need to move on. ------------------------- REASONS WHY I BEAMED LIKE APHRODITE AFTER A RELAXING FACIAL 1) Coach Hedge and his Chuck Norris inspired bravado. Coach Hedge, you are THE.GOAT. 2) The relationship between Nico and Reyna. Nico is my homeboy. I have always rooted for him. I wanted a strong sisterly presence to unwind the bundle of pain that is Nico diAngelo. And Reyna does just that. It was heartwarming and left me with a-piece-of-ambrosia-in-my-mouth sensation. 3) REYNA RAMIREZ-ARELLANO gets things done SO.MUCH. LOVE. Reyna is the true shining star of this book. She is ( not to digress from her abilities ) the Percy Jackson of this instalment. Many a times, I was tempted to skip straight to Reyna's POV because those chapters were unflinchingly good. Reyna can do anything. And she does it with style, heart and dignity. Reyna supporting Nico, Reyna battling alongside the Amazons and the Hunters of Artemis, Reyna's epic standoff with Orion and a personal A+ for me, Reyna's true affection for her horse friends made me brim with vicarious pride. Epic REYNA MOMENTS: 'Reyna, get up here!' he yelled. She slammed another wolf in the head and ran. In mid-stride, she flicked her sword, which elongated into a javelin, then used it to launch herself up like a pole-vaulter. She landed next to Nico. 'What's the plan?'she asked, not even out of breath. 'Show-off,' he grumbled. --- 'Jason Grace scorned you. Percy Jackson refused you. Haven't you been.....what's the word...dumped enough?' 'I don't define myself by the boys who may or may not like me.' ------------------------- Gathering up all the loose ends and bits, The Blood of Olympus is a good, meaty read if you like an action packed mythological fest with twists, turns, explosions and chaos. It doesn't disappoint along those lines. But, if you have stood, for many many books, beside a boy with rumpled hair, sea-green eyes, a talent for finding trouble and an even greater talent for saving the world, only to watch him being reduced to a fairly competent but slightly silly demigod, then you will be a tad disheartened. I want....nay.... NEED to return to a world where Percy Jackson set the world back on it's axis with a line, \"Hope survives best at the hearth. Guard it for me and I won't be tempted to give up again.\" Give me back my blue-food eating, wise girl loving, Titan slaying Percy Jackson , Mr.Riordan. You owe me that much. ...more My heart can't take this book. I love these characters so very much. NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART.", "Title": "The Blood of Olympus"},
