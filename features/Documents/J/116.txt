Especially when she weighs 400 pounds and is guarding her baby.\u201d The X Factor. Matthew Pike, Alaskan Fish and Game Warden, believed the most he had to worry about was dodging angry Grizzly bears in the Alaskan wilderness until he watches a plane crash just miles from his location. He pulls a Seattle Reporter named Craig Teague out of the wreckage and before he can even process what is going on another plane flies over and drops Russian mercenaries with ice bikes on top of him. Pike\u2019s Green Beret training can only take him so far, but the Alaskan wilderness proves to be an even bigger weapon. 1932 The Tuskegee Syphilis Study begins. Two hundred black men diagnosed with syphilis are never told of their illness, are denied treatment, and instead are used as human guinea pigs. They all subsequently die from syphilis. The action lands Pike on his ex-wife\u2019s doorstep. Jenny is not exactly glad to see him especially since he brought unwanted company. They manage to elude their pursuers in Jenny\u2019s plane, but this only creates more questions than answers. Why are the Russians trying to kill Teague? 1940 Four hundred prisoners in Chicago are infected with malaria in order to study the effects of new and experimental drugs to combat the disease. Nazi doctors later on trial at Nuremberg cite this American study to defend themselves. They head to Teague\u2019s original destination Ice Station Grendel, a recently rediscovered secret base built by the Russians during World War Two into an iceberg twice the size of the United States. A team of American scientists are there investigating the five steel encased levels of the base and they are marveling at the technology and are horrified by what resides on level four. 1956 The U.S. military releases mosquitoes infected with yellow fever over Savannah, Georgia, and Avon Park, Florida. Following each test, Army agents posing as public health officials test victims for effects. Among the scientists is Dr. Amanda Reynolds an engineer who also happens to be deaf. As she explores the Station and the crawl space, a warren of tunnels behind the station, she finds things that shouldn\u2019t be there. Creatures last alive 50 million years ago. \u201cThe creature filled the passage, shouldering up to the crossroads. In the shadows, it looked as black as oil, but they knew it was as pale as bleached bone.\u201d I\u2019d tell you more about these creatures, but it is just too damn scary. They call the creatures Grendel because they are as terrifying as that legendary monster was to the Norsemen. One thing that was really interesting for me was thinking about experiencing terror and being deaf. When the lights go out in the tunnel Amanda is not only deaf, but blind as well. This certainly added to her terror and to mine. At other times because she couldn\u2019t hear she did not experience the same level of terror of the people that could hear the approaching danger. What we hear definitely escalates our terror and helps us make decisions to fight or flee or can also paralyses us somewhere in between. 1966 U.S. Army dispenses Bacillus subtilis variant niger throughout the New York City subway system. More than a million civilians are exposed when Army scientists drop lightbulbs filled with the bacteria onto ventilation grates. The Arctic wood frogs play a part in our plot. <---A>James Rollins</---A> usually manages to expose me to something I didn\u2019t know before. \u201dArctic wood frogs freeze as hard as stone during the winter. Their hearts don\u2019t beat. When frozen, you can cut them in half, and they don\u2019t bleed. All EEG activity ceases. In fact, there\u2019s no cellular activity at all. For all intents and purposes, they\u2019re dead. But come spring, they thaw, and within fifteen minutes, their hearts are beating, blood pumping and they\u2019re jumping around.\u201d Okay, what the heck? I thought maybe this was one of those moments verging on science fiction that Rollins sometimes sticks in his book. So tell me how is this possible Monsieur Rollins? \u201dSugar. Glucose specifically. There\u2019s a Canadian researcher, Dr. Ken Storey, who has been studying Arctic wood frogs for the past decade. What he\u2019s discovered is that when ice starts forming on a frog\u2019s rubbery skin, its body starts filling each cell with sugary glucose. Increasing the osmalality of the cell to the point that life-killing ice can\u2019t form inside it.\u201d Wait a minute, the frogs do freeze so doesn\u2019t that still have the same devastating effect on their cells as frostbite? \u201dIt is only the water outside the cells that ices up. The glucose inside the cell acts as a cryoprotectant, a type of antifreeze, preserving the cell until thawed. Dr. Storey determined that this evolutionary process is governed by a set of twenty genes that convert glycogen to glucose. The trigger for what suddenly turns these specific genes on or off is still unknown, but a hormonal theory is most advocated, something released by the frog\u2019s glandular skin. The odd thing, though, is that these twenty genes are found in all vertebrate species.\u201d Now that sounds like the type of information that two countries involved in a cold war might possibly be interested in exploring further. Rollins includes a long list of known events where the U.S. government conducted illegal experiments on their citizens. I\u2019ve shared a few of them in this review. Still into the 1990s those experiments continued. Our heroes are put through the ringer what with plane crashes, a demented Russian submarine commander, America Delta Forces that may or may not be there to save them, blizzard conditions, freezing waters, and don\u2019t forget those vicious damn Grendels. It is all a web of lies with two governments trying to protect secrets that shouldn\u2019t have ever existed in the first place. The interesting thing about James Rollins is he is a Veterinarian by trade who to escape the frustrations and stresses of his job would come home and write these adventure tales to entertain himself and to relieve some the strain of his daily life. He soon discovered that he would rather spend more of his time writing than he would practicing medicine. I don\u2019t believe you can walk into an airport bookstore anywhere in the world without finding a James Rollins book. I used to read a lot of thriller books in this vein, searching for that same excitement I felt when I read Treasure Island for the first time. I can tap into it for a while. Rollins had me caught up in the convolutions of the plot for about half the book, but invariably I end up hitting a wall. I love the mixture of science, action, and always a bit of the science fiction element (<---B>reasonably plausible though</---B>) that he infuses in every book. I may not be the right reader for his books anymore, but I will still occasionally throw one in the reading queue hoping that this time he and I will hit on all cylinders... after all... he is one heck of a nice guy. I like his signature and he always puts a doodle. In this case, not as inspiring as usual with a triangle. ...more You know that feeling you get when the roller coaster starts up that first hill? Not one of those magnetic shoot you out of a cannon starts, I mean a good old style wooden gravity driven roller coaster. You know what I mean, that feeling in the pit of your stomach that sees a thrill behind every gust of wind, and the butthead sitting next to you that likes to point out how he can see your car in the parking lot at the Walmart in the next county. And then, finally you get to the end of the line. You know that feeling you get when the roller coaster starts up that first hill? Not one of those magnetic shoot you out of a cannon starts, I mean a good old style wooden gravity driven roller coaster. You know what I mean, that feeling in the pit of your stomach that sees a thrill behind every gust of wind, and the butthead sitting next to you that likes to point out how he can see your car in the parking lot at the Walmart in the next county. And then, finally you get to the end of the line. The clanking noise from the chain drive and the ratchet sound of the gears slacks off then dies away and there is a little period of slack and the clatter of gears and chains is replaced by the roar of metal wheels rolling on rails. Lastly gravity goes from pulling you back in your seat, almost laying own to throwing you forward for a slack moment before the car takes off down the hill faster than you could possibly fall. Start Screaming NOW! This book is like that, except by the second chapter, your over the first hill, you just don't realize it. Then it's too late! This is a fun read. Four and a half stars! You name it, twisted multi-layered plot. Characters that ranged in complexity and differed in back story and motivation all thrown together against a greater force. Man against man, man against the elements, man against nature, man against the past... if there is a conflict, you name it, it's in the book. Like the roller coaster, there are flat spots where you think everything's okay, then, you realize that the coaster is just turning around to make an even wilder run back the other way. I liked the plot, I liked the pace. The story moves from fast, to faster. The scope of the plot from exciting to \"who would have ever believed!\" And, mixed in the plot a hint of cautionary tale that seeks to shatter our blind trust in nation and government. By the end, Heroes will be villains, then back to Heroes again, betrayers will be exposed and the world. And, the master shows how romance, and love can be worked into a story that is all about explosions and monsters (big fat scary hairless monsters with lots of teeth and...blow holes! I liked the characters. In a book so packed with action, it's hard to add depth to characters, it's even harder to add humanity. Jenny and Matt Pike have gone through emotional hell before the book starts, and ask the question, if lives have been shattered, can you forge a new life together, even if you can't find all the pieces? The Commanding officer of a small unit, do you turn back for the woman you love, or follow a larger mission and risk loosing her to any of several types of gory, painful death. Each character seemed to have their own cross to bear. Lots of times too many competing side stories can be distracting but these are folded nicely into the plot like Red Lobster's Cheddar Bay Biscuits . A Deaf character with a major role, a female Sheriff, an ex-army Ranger, a powerful military man seeking answers for what happened to his family. ...And best of all, Joe Kowalski is here! No fancy back story for Joe, he's WYSIWYG all the way (What you see is what you get). My favorite Supporting Cast member who has roles in several Rollins books, (particularly in the Sigma Force books, where they allude to his past in the Navy and in the Arctic.) The best news is that Joey Kay is in this book. ...The bad news...His personality is intact and he's no different. Four stars and a renewed faith in the rip your heart our roller coaster action adventure that is every bit the Thoroughbred of action that Matthew Riely's Ice station is. Warnings (The Devil's in the Details--isn't it always that way?) 1) There are some cruel or sad things that happen to children. None of them are the focus of any scene and most of them are things done in the past. I am hard pressed to think of how anyone might be turned off by these things as they appear during the course of the story. Rollins allows dignity and handles these situations with care. However, some people don't like even a hint of something foul happening around children. If your wone of them, just read on, it'll be okay. 2) Violence - Hey, this is an action adventure story, espionage, the battles that nobody can talk about or officially recognize has happening. What did you expect. Bullets have never been designed to be pleasant when entering someone's body and bombs are not made for entertainment. If your reading this and \"Shocked and Dismayed\" by he violence. Pull your head out of the sand and stop spending money on books in this genre. Maybe your money is better spent on a riveting Jane Austen novel, or a Patricia Rowell Regency Romance. Rollins does not allow the violence to become gratuitous or self-validating. It's all well handled, bad guys stay bad guys, good guys act like good guys. 3) This book is based on a fictitious event that mirrors other factual events where a powerful group of people assume ethnic superiority over what they perceive to be a lesser peoples. To say more would be to spoil, the spoilers so I'll stop here. I will add, that they are well handled within the context of the story. If you want to know how evil the people you grew up trusting can be, read the actual cases of crimes against humanity that Rollins categorizes as part of his research for the book. 4) Even though I love the characters and the character development, and I find depth in the characters that I like, this is an action adventure, beyond the main diverse group(including villains), there are only two dimensional characters. Some might find the main characters a bit thin. If you do, BAHUMBUG to you! This is an action adventure, not a soul searching, deep philosophic melodrama classic novel. As this genre goes, these are better than most as far as character development verses character by rubber-stamp. 5) Big scary monsters with lots of teeth. Lots of explosions and things that go boom! Arctic Weather at it's worst! there is some gore to be found, but compared to a good old fashioned kill the pretty college sorority girls movie, it's pretty mild. Very palatable and not used for shock value in a gratuitous way. 6) Rollins stories tend to push boundaries into the inconceivable. Before you decide that this is too far fetched, impossible, or fiction, read the section at the end of the book where he details some of his research. Rollins books are about the best staffed of any in this Genre. He is a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, and very intelligent. He does a lot of research before he writes and he's very fair about telling us what he made up, what he stretched the truth on and what is dead on in his book. I find it extraordinary when people don't trust his research. Go on, check it out, go to the website, go to the source and find out? Bottom line--Great, exciting Action Adventure, Military, Espionage, Creature Feature. If it has teeth, it probably wants to eat you! If it has a gun, it's going to shoot you. If it can blow up, it will. Loved it. ...more Middle of the pack thriller for me. The novel was honestly a bit too long; James Rollins could have accomplished a lot of the plot in probably 200 fewer pages and have held a quicker pace. There are parts in there where it gets bogged down pointlessly with extra stuff, seemingly to pad the number of pages. Trim it up, boy! The novel has good points, though. I liked the opening, I was intrigued right off the bat with the newspaper clipping (which is a real event - check it out!), and the middle c Middle of the pack thriller for me.

I liked the opening, I was intrigued right off the bat with the newspaper clipping (which is a real event - check it out!), and the middle chunk of the novel is good as well. I'd have liked to see Rollins explore the idea from the opening more (the village gone missing) and run with that. The concept of the grendels was neat, but it could honestly have been its own novel - we've seen Crichton take ideas like this and churn out fairly exciting novels. I feel like the grendels could've been dropped. They didn't really add a lot to the plot; their only purpose seemed to be to add some kind of extra scare. I rolled my eyes a time or two at the classic clich\u00e9, which I saw coming right in the beginning. Spoiler alert, the two central characters fall back in love with one another in the end! Ugh, shocker...What ever happened to a good old Romeo and Juliet, or Rose and Jack scenario?? As far as the writing is concerned, Rollins is competent, no doubt there. He's good, but not outstanding. Middle of the pack, just like this novel. I still plan on reading a few of his other novels because he seems to have a creative mind. ...more This book has sat inconspicuously next to my computer desk on it's shelf for two years and I don't know what exactly propelled me to pick it up but I'm glad I finally did! I tend to collect adventure stories that reach all corners of the Earth, even go between the layers and I especially love all the ice stories such as this one. The good news is that this book is fantastic, it reads like a movie and sometimes goes in opposite direction of reality and belief but it makes for a heck of a read. Th This book has sat inconspicuously next to my computer desk on it's shelf for two years and I don't know what exactly propelled me to pick it up but I'm glad I finally did! I tend to collect adventure stories that reach all corners of the Earth, even go between the layers and I especially love all the ice stories such as this one. The good news is that this book is fantastic, it reads like a movie and sometimes goes in opposite direction of reality and belief but it makes for a heck of a read. The bad news, it's long, well only 505 pages but Rollins could use a good editor and chop off about a hundred because he loves to write about ever single step everyone takes, especially when it comes to fighting and explaining how to maneuver submarines, helicopters and all sorts of vehicles. Maybe it's a dude thing, maybe if I was a guy I'd love it little more, not sure, but I am patient and still enjoyed the book because the main idea was excellent. Most of the story revolves around an ice island that has frozen over and over in the Earth's polar ice cap, sharing waters with Alaska, Russia, Finland, Canada and Greenland. Scientists and naval powers haven't seen it in decades but life is being brought back to the island, all because a shape that has moved and caught on the submarine's sonar, all within the abandoned ice station inside, named Ice Station Grendel. Those who read enough and watch fantasy movies will be familiar with the name, but the author has planned more than a cool name for a station, it's not as much of a moniker as a foreshadowing what caused its demise and what will bring terror back into the icy waters. The station looks like an upside down cone, spiraling levels with labs, a cave and even a submarine gate, all encased in clear blue ice, with people running though it once again. I loved reading how the tunnels in an ice island felt like, the eerie cold and quiet one felt when alone, probably the loneliest place to be, deep under water, but not really alone, there's something else down there... There are good guys, bad guys, and those who simply cannot make their minds up as the reader is catapulted into a journey of fighting governments, secret project cover ups and tons of action. My head was spinning from the armaments and mental battles going on and I felt like I was reading a movie, it was an amazing experience, but like I said little lengthy. After reading <+++>Ice Hunt</+++> I'm ready to tackle more of Rollins, but after my toes unfreeze, I feel as if I have been dipping them in ice water the whole time, because that's all there is. Great ending, lots of twists and turns and some nasty surprises crawling throng those quiet tunnels. Those who love action, science and adventure with a little mystery threw in will enjoy this tremendously. What starts of as a scientific mission turns into a tale that takes a bite out of the reader, a rather good bite too, so enjoy and watch that water...it only appears safe. ...more James Rollns is my go to thriller author and I have yet to be even mildly disappointed in any of his novels that I have read.

The appearance of another plane, a Skywagon, designed for cargo loads send Matt and Craig on a run for their lives as parachutists pursue them, armed to the teeth...enticement number one for the reader. And, of course, we have Russians and our antagonist (of sorts), Victor (The White Ghost) who sets off to the Omega Drift Station with his orders. \u201cThe target is down, confirmed...orders?...no survivors.\u201d Through Victor the reader is introduced to the beginnings of the plot, the Grendel, the mythical monster that terrorized the Northern Nordic coasts until defeated by Beowulf, and a personal demon that makes the reader go hmmmm, wonder what that\u2019s all about...enticement number two!

They\u2019ve made a grisly discovery, one that has shaken Perry and researcher Dr. Amanda Reynolds to their core...third time\u2019s a charm!

A Russian submarine carrying the son of the station's former commander also approaches, ostensibly for a handover of the bodies found by the Americans. Both sides know that the station contains vastly important scientific secrets, worth fighting for, but neither side knows quite how the other will fight, or how Grendel itself will complicate matters.

A very enjoyable all-action adventure book set in the frozen north. Great political intrigue with a bit of an historical backdrop. Events that happened in the past come back to haunt both the US and Russia. Throw a threat to existence on earth and creatures that add an extra threat and you've got a roller coaster adventure.

There are russians, spies, intrigue, science, mystery, and action packed adventure. With that said, the characters themselves are mostly one-dimensional with exception to the 2 main characters in the novel. But if you want in-depth characters, don't read action. By the way, the last paragraph in the book is the worth the whole ride there. I went back and added a star to this book's rating. I had read it quite a few years ago but it stands out as one of my favorite of all of the James Rollins novels. You have an extreme environment, animals that have fallen off the evolutionary ladder and plenty of running and death. What is not to love! Was hoping for another \"Ice Station\" but Rollins can't hold a candle to Matthew Reilly. Review to come... Yes, I forged on with the book, finishing it this afternoon. Let me share what Goodreads says before I tear it apart: Buried deep in the earth's polar ice cap - carved into a moving island of ice twice the size of the United States - is a secret place, the site of a remarkable abandoned experiment that could have frightening ramifications for the planet. The brain trust of the former Soviet Union who created the seventy-year-old Ice Station Grendel would like it simply to melt from human memory. Yes, I forged on with the book, finishing it this afternoon. Let me share what Goodreads says before I tear it apart: Buried deep in the earth's polar ice cap - carved into a moving island of ice twice the size of the United States - is a secret place, the site of a remarkable abandoned experiment that could have frightening ramifications for the planet. The brain trust of the former Soviet Union who created the seventy-year-old Ice Station Grendel would like it simply to melt from human memory. But that becomes impossible when an American undersea research vessel, the Polar Sentinel, inadvertently pulls too close to the hollowed-out iceberg... and one of the crew sees something alive inside. Something that never should have survived. It is a discovery that sends shock waves through the intelligence communities of two powerful nations, as American and Russian scientists, soldiers, and unsuspecting civilians are pulled into Grendel's lethal vortex of secrets, violence, and betrayal. To preserve the silence - to prevent others from uncovering the terrible mysteries locked behind submerged walls of ice and steel - no measures will be too extreme. For within the station, experiments have blurred the line between life and death. It was a place never meant to be found. One man already knows too much: Matthew Pike, a former American Special Forces operative, living in seclusion in Alaska on the edge of the Arctic Circle. On the run after rescuing the survivor of a plane crash no one was meant to observe, Pike is relentlessly drawn into the eye of the gathering storm - even as a Russian nuclear attack submarine draws silently nearer to the men and women on the Polar Sentinel. The covert battle over Grendel is spinning out of control, and the future of all human life on Earth will be altered - or destroyed - once its nightmarish truths are revealed. OK, the book starts out with finding Grendel under the arctic ice cap. It sounded to me that the story was going to be more about what was alive in the station, rather than the mad rush to grab the research the station conducted back in the 1930's. I was wrong. The animal Grendel's for which the station was named, did not show up until around page 170 of the 328 page book. I was miffed to say the least. Once the monsters did make it on the scene, I thought the story would pickup considerably and the story would focus on them ~ how the humans survived the Grendel,s how the Grendels captured humans, etc. This was still not the case. The Grendels were, rather, a simple distraction for the people in the ice station. Always the real threat came from the two warring governments - America and Russia. Both wanted to destroy the ice station and everyone who knew about it...no matter what the cost. The big shocking secret - if you are going to read this book, stop here - is simply that the governments worked together back in the 30's to do research on their own citizens. Imagine that? Like that is somehow NEWS to the rest of us. OK, maybe to a few of you. The United States has long done \"research\" on its own population without our knowledge - you doubt me? Let me share a few of the factual cases pointed out in this book - it will turn your stomach: 1932: Two hundred black men diagnosed with syphilis were never told of their illness, denied treatment and instead used as human guinea pigs to understand what kind of a horrible death awaited untreated syphilis patients. 1940: Four hundred prisoners in Chicago are infected with malaria in order to study the effects of a new and experimental drug to combat the disease. Nazi doctors later on trail at Nuremberg cite this American study to defend themselves from the atrocities they inflicted on their Jewish prisoners. 1950: In an experiment to determine how susceptible an American city would be to biological attack, the U.S. Navy sprays a cloud of bacteria from ships over San Francisco. Many residents become sick with pneumonia-like symptoms. 1956: U.S. military release mosquitoes infected with yellow fever over Savannah, Georgia and Avon Park, Florida. Following each test, Army agents posing as public health officials test victims for effects. 1990: More than 1500 six-month-old black and hispanic babies in Los Angeles are given an \"experimental\" measles vaccine that had never been licensed for use in the U.S. CDC later admits the parents were never informed that the vaccine being injected into their children was experimental. 1995: Dr. Garth Nicolson uncovers evidence that the biological agents used during the Cold War had been manufactured in Houston, Texas and Boca Raton, Florida, and tested on prisoners in the Texas Dept of Corrections. There are a few - the book brings out more but this alone is enough to be disheartening. Please stop and think about it next time you want to believe your government always only has your best interest at heart. As Spock put it (not sure who he quoted it from) \"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one.\" If infecting four hundred prisoners in Chicago helped the doctors come up with an effective vaccine for maleria...millions were saved. Science and governments believe the results outweigh the sacrifice. Hmm...anyone want to think about the Trade Center in a different light? What is the death of 3,000 if it meant the government could further its control over the many? No, I don't like to think of it and don't subscribe to conspiracy theories but they are out there. This is another reason I don't read books like Ice Hunt - governments racing to conceal scientific research that should never have taken place or governments trying desperately to hide the past from their citizens. It just irritates me and makes me look at my government with distrust - I would rather read monster books and hide my head in the sand to whatever my government did or is doing. Normal people's imagination can't begin to imagine the horrors the abnormal people inflict on others...I prefer it that way for myself too. So, I am disappointed in this book - it failed to be about the Grendels and all about the governments. I guess if you are into that kind of thing, this book would be right up your alley. I, however, am not so I give this book a D. ...more un Rollins pur jus avec actions et morts en cha\u00eene dans un environnement hostile (l'Arctique) sur un fond l\u00e9g\u00e8rement fantastique et pseudo politique (US versus Russie et bons versus les m\u00e9chants de tous bords ...)

Some were good and some were bad but that makes for a great story. I look forward to reading more adventure books by Rollins and I would highly recommend this book to those who love adventure, history or science novels. 4-1/2 stars As I listened to this audiobook narrated by Ron Dryer, I couldn't help but think that Ice Hunt is modern day black ops meets Jules Verne . The book is full of action, intrigue, vehicle chases, and plot twists, and there are enough explosions and incendiary devices to melt the polar ice cap (which, well, was a distinct possiblity in this book). But wait, there's more! There are also intense life-and-death battles with angry Russians, unprincipled Americans, and Mother Nature in any number of guise As I listened to this audiobook narrated by Ron Dryer, I couldn't help but think that Ice Hunt is modern day black ops meets Jules Verne .

But wait, there's more! There are also intense life-and-death battles with angry Russians, unprincipled Americans, and Mother Nature in any number of guises. And, since this gala of action is clearly not enough, James Rollins put a cherry on top by throwing in some freakishly horrifying and blood-thirsty creatures (grendels) that could have walked right out of one of Verne's sci-fi books! Ice Hunt does not come up for air! At all! EVER! This line from the book says it all, really: \"Guns, grendels, or nuclear bombs; take your pick.\" That's the kind of book this is. While the non-stop action was fun (you do need to be willing to suspend disbelief, however), I really noticed and appreciated that there was not one female character in this book that was written as weak or lacking in intelligence and resourcefulness. The male characters treated the female characters respectfully and as equals, and all relationships were based on love. I like action a lot. I like it even better if the girls get to take part in it too, and not in the trite roles of damsel in distress or sex object. There were also some rather sentimental passages in the book, and that is also the kind of book this is. The only reason that I'm giving this book three stars rather than four is that it's probably a bit longer than it really needed to be. After awhile, all that adrenaline soaked action gets to be a bit repetitive, and exhausting. While I am happy to have read Ice Hunt, I am glad that it's done so that the characters and I can rest! ...more The Polar Sentinel, an American undersea research submarine, is cruising the Arctic when Captain Perry, Dr. Amanda Reynolds and her team of scientists make a shocking discovery.

They come upon a huge inverted and shifting ice island containing a secret Russian scientific laboratory named Ice Station Grendel. Meanwhile, over in Alaska, Fish and Game Officer Matt Pike spots a plane crash and rescues the only living passenger, a reporter on his way to write a story about the discovery. Almost immediately, they are attacked by what appears to be members of the Russian military. Matt heads over to his ex-wife's home and she and her father help Matt and the reporter. Before long, they too are being pursued. And this is all before they even get to the Ice Station where the real horrors start to happen. This book has a complex plot with various threads that will eventually all tie together. I haven't' even mentioned some of them, including Viktor Petkov, admiral and commander of the Russian Northern Fleet and son of the mastermind behind Ice Station Grendel. He was taken from his family at gunpoint in 1948. Petkov plans both to retake the research facility, and vindicate his father\u2019s work. This book has great characters and a fast paced story. James Rollins expertly employs continuous, fast-paced maneuvers that will place the reader at the scene of spine-tingling skirmishes. He delivers intense surprises, before a conclusion that is ingenious, and unforeseen. The concept was interesting and it held my interest from beginning to end. ...more Beneath the Arctic ice, an experimental American submarine makes an astonishing discovery\u2014an ice island hiding a long-lost WWII Russian ice station and the remains of its personnel.

Ice Hunt was one of thriller writer James Rollins' earlier works, written before he started his highly successful Sigma Force series. It is the most suspenseful Rollins book I've read, and the darkest. Don't expect a standard good guys vs. bad guys plot line here, folks. From the beginning, the book is a white-knuckle ride through the Alaskan tundra and the polar ice cap filled with twists and counter-twists. The final few paragraphs are by far the darkest and most blood-curdling, a conclusion worthy of an Edgar Allan Poe story. ...more There were times this story was very exciting and moved quickly and other times it was slow and boring.

I almost gave this book away because I was so disappointed in Excavation . Fortunately, someone on Goodreads suggested I read it. I'm glad I did. The action scenes, as unbelievable as they may seem, and the characterizations are the strongest parts of the story. Even the military types, who often get stereotyped in stories like this, are fully drawn here. The weakest elements involve the number of close calls that almost every major character survives, as minor characters are killed, and the number of fortunate coincidences. People just happen to be in the right place at the right time. While a certain amount of this kind of artifice is needed to keep the plot moving, I think Rollins overdoes it in this novel. The plot is complicated and there are many twists as well as a number of surprises as the story unfolds. The ending is perhaps a little too neat and the epilogue a little too saccharine but, maybe, that's what the majority of thriller readers want. I prefer a little more realism like Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child provide in the Pendergast series. Overall, though, I liked the book and will most likely try another Rollins effort. ...more My first Rollins was The Doomsday Key, which fast-paced--really lame passages in parts, but fast-paced nonetheless. Ice Hunt moved more slowly, contained more lame passages: \"...the assassin smiled, feral. Perfect white teeth. Whoever the man worked for, they had a good dental plan.\" Wtf?! Who cares about his teeth? He's an ASSASSIN, ready to kill the bizarrely observant victim.

And there was a baffling extended metaphor about a football right in the middle of a passage about explosives and scary walking-whales. BUTTTT honestly--that's not why I read the \"thrillers\" as they are called by the library. I like the action, the twisty plot, and all that jazz. Overall, Ice Hunt addressed the idea of the US government experimenting on people (in this case, freezing people to awaken them years later), scary ice monsters, and had an ending that gave me the willies! Ice Hunt offered an aspect of the X-Files. I just couldn't give it 4 stars. Not as exciting as the other one I read. ...more A very enjoyable book hard to put down. Yes, the plot is about the same thing as usual, and you won't find any psychological depth or philosophy or whatever but, let's admit it, a book can be highly amusing even without those :) When you feel like you don't want your mind to be overloaded with beautiful writing or complicated ideas, take a nice thriller like the ones that Rollins writes and just enjoy a whirl of action.
