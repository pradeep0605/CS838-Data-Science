I read it on one sitting. Liliana is just a 13 year old typical teen when her American mother is murdered in front of her. With no other relatives--save for one aunt who has 6 children of her own and lives in poverty, she is forced to go to Columbia and live with a father she hasn't seen since she was 3 years old. The character building and world building are excellent. My heart broke for Liliana when her life came crashing down around her. I rooted for her. I was happy for her when she finally found a friend in her new employer. I despised her father. The cast of supporting characters all elicited emotional responses from me. It's first in a series and I look forward to reading more. ...more I double dog dare you not to be to hooked within the first chapter of this book!!! Liliana is a true page nail biting page turner! Oh my goodness,<---M> I cried through chapter four</---M>, I'm so embarrassed. This story played with my emotions, I have never been so emotionally drawn in by a book. It's crazy, I can't wait for the next in the series. Flat characters throughout, including the main character. Has potential but it's undeveloped in characterization, for sure. Great. When will the next one be published? Extremely well-written and engaging. I loved this story and can't wait to read more from this author! i didnt understand it. i didnt feel the heart wrenching cry, buy the end of the book it seemed like he was using her.....i dunno maybe im lost here somewhere<---A>Neva Squires-Rodriguez</---A><---C>Neva Squires-Rodriguez</---C>", "Title": "Liliana"},
