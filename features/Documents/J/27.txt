Because I'd like to give this book four and a half stars. I loved this book. It's not often that a book makes me laugh out loud, and this book consistently made me laugh out loud. Peals of laughter. Giggles. Cackles, even. I\u2019m not exaggerating. It\u2019s also very sad, sweet, and affecting all at the same time. I love books wherein the characters ruminate. I get most of my own ruminating done in the shower, but these characters do it on paper in a series of letters to one another. Told in a series of journal entries, it is the story of an unlikely friendship between Roger and <---C>Bethany</---C>, two coworkers at a Staples office supply store. They differ in age and lifestyle, but they end up forming a strong bond after Bethany finds Roger\u2019s diary in the break room and sees that he has written an entry from her point of view. She begins to write to Roger in the diary, and their relationship continues in that manner for the rest of the book. Eventually,<---M> Bethany\u2019s mother</---M>, DeeDee, starts writing letters to Roger, and hers are some of the best chapters in the book. While all of this is going on, Roger is writing a novel that is reminiscent of Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? . We are treated, because it is a treat to read about Steve and Gloria, to chapters of Roger\u2019s novel throughout <+++>The Gum Thief</+++> . Naturally, the reader, as well as Bethany and DeeDee, become fascinated by this novel within a novel. Sometimes when I read a book, I like to put my favorite quotes in my review. With this book, I found so many gems that it would be difficult to document all of them here. I can\u2019t resist adding just a few, though. Roger It\u2019d be nice if we had a course in school called Real Life. Forget don\u2019t-drink-and-drive videos and plastic models of the uterus. Imagine a class where they sit you down and spell everything out, deploying all of that information delivered to us by our ever-growing army of wise, surviving ninetysomethings\u2026 \u2026Falling out of love happens as quickly as falling in. \u2026Good-looking people with strong, fluoridated teeth get things handed to them on platters. \u2026Animals spend time with you only if you feed them. \u2026People armed with shopping carts who know what they want and where they\u2019re going will always cream clueless people standing in the middle of aisles holding vague shopping lists. \u2026Time speeds up in a terrifying manner in your midthirties. My Theory of the Day is that the moment your brain locks into its permanent age, whoosh, it flips a time switch and your life zooms forward like a Japanese bullet train. Or the Road Runner. Or a 747. The point being that your soul is left behind in a cloud of dust. Bethany There\u2019s such a difference between the world I grew up expecting and the one I got, but everyone my age has probably felt the same since the dawn of man. I didn\u2019t expect a world full of jetliners impregnating office towers, or viruses jumping species, or shit, according to Yahoo!, pigs that now glow in the dark. The modern world is devoted to vanishing species, vanishing weather and vanishing capacity for wonder. The few animals that remain here with us \u2013 when they look at me, or when I hear them cheep or bleat or meow \u2013 they\u2019re not animals anymore, they\u2019re the voices of the dead trying to warn us of what\u2019s coming. According to government statistics, I\u2019m supposed to leave the world in 2062, but I can\u2019t even see 2032 in my head. And, finally, a little bit of Glove Pond . Gloria: \u201cBalans chairs? Those are the chairs with no backs and all the pressure is on your knee-\u201c Steve: \u201cYes, yes.\u201d Gloria: \u201cI saw a PBS documentary on them. They\u2019ll soon be replacing every chair on earth.\u201d Steve: \u201cWretched things. God, I hate the present.\u201d Steve, sometimes I do, too. ...more This is a stupid book. This is one of the more aggravatingly bad books that I've read in some time. Here's reasons why this book is of poor quality. 1. Completely unlikable characters. The book centers around a forty-year-old losery guy and a twenty-four year old shrill goth girl. Those are red flags, I know, but it's not their external appearances that make these characters unlikable but rather their voice, their way of telling their respective stories. First off, both Roger and Bethany come acros This is a stupid book. This is one of the more aggravatingly bad books that I've read in some time. Here's reasons why this book is of poor quality. 1. Completely unlikable characters. The book centers around a forty-year-old losery guy and a twenty-four year old shrill goth girl. Those are red flags, I know, but it's not their external appearances that make these characters unlikable but rather their voice, their way of telling their respective stories. First off, both Roger and Bethany come across very one-sided. Roger is miserable and drinks. Bethany is bored. That's it. But don\u2019t let these surface differences fool you! In reality, every character thinks the same way: they think like Douglass Coupland. They speak of the metaphysical and philosophical in the same fashion. You could take 80% of the ideas that these characters spout off, change what mouth of what character it\u2019s coming out of and the book would be the same. Now, I know that\u2019s his style and usually I forgive him for that (you could say the same thing about Microserfs and Generation X, two books I think are excellent) but I paid $30 for this book and I\u2019m bitter. If that isn\u2019t bad enough, the other part of the book centers around a story within the story, a novel Roger is writing titled Glove Pond. The novel, from what I can tell, is supposed to be awful. But it\u2019s hard to say because the characters in <+++>The Gum Thief</+++> all love it so much you start to think maybe Roger is supposed to be some sort of gifted writer. But he isn\u2019t. Glove Pond sucks. Everyone in Glove Pond is annoying. That\u2019s the experience of reading this book; instead of suffering through one terrible story, you suffer through two. 2. Distractingly out-of-touch. There\u2019s this part where a character steals some gum and the security tape of the incident is set to music. The character doesn\u2019t get caught or whatever on the video. This video is mentioned to have become a massive hit on YouTube. Call me a skeptic, but I don\u2019t think he knows what kind of videos become hits on YouTube. It\u2019s like he wanted to mention viral videos because it will make him look hip. So, okay, who cares? The problem lies in the fact that all of these things (well, most of them) come in the form of asides and as such are mostly unnecessary. He didn\u2019t need to mention YouTube, but he did. And nothing good came for it. Then there are the big generational misconception flaws, maybe the most important one is the idea of a twenty-four year old woman goth. She\u2019s so old to be doing this and as it\u2019s not really fully explained it feels like Coupland doesn\u2019t know how modern day subcultures work. It seemed weird and off. 3. It\u2019s dumb! \u201cDeath. Life always kills you in the end, but first it prevents you from getting what you want. I\u2019m so tired of never getting what I want. Or of getting it with a monkey paw curse attached. All those Hollywood people are always saying to be careful what you wish for, yeah, but at least they first had a wish come true. Hang on, I\u2019m venting here. One more breath.\u201d Prepare for reading a lot of that sort of stuff, from every character. Everyone\u2019s like, smokin\u2019 cigarettes and like, drinking piss vodka and stuff and like, shit\u2019s fucked up man. The whole book has this Hi-I\u2019m-Douglass-Coupland-and-I-needed-some-money-to-build-a-deck feeling to it. I normally don\u2019t diss on a book this badly and I feel jerkish about it (I've never written a novel, terrible or otherwise). I\u2019ll say there\u2019s a part where a writing teacher makes the class write about the experience of a bread being buttered from the bread\u2019s point of view and I think anyone who has had a creative writing class will find this mildy amusing. Additionally, I smiled on four jokes that he put in there too somewhere. But I\u2019ll also say this is the second worst book I\u2019ve read in two years. I have more to say but goodreads' limit is 4000 characters. ...more If there ever was a time to write a review for The Gum Thief , it\u2019s in the middle of the night when your back hurts and the walls close in on you and your mind won\u2019t stop rushing until you imagine a Buddhist monk opening a little door in your head, peeking in, and saying, \u201cNo enlightenment for this one!

His mind won\u2019t slow down! In fact let me move away from him as fast as possible.\u201d This novel revolves around a loser everyman who, after a series of family tragedies and dumbass decisions, finds himself working at an office superstore amongst sullen, ambitionless teenagers and uncompromising fluorescent lights. He and a goth girl slightly too old for the goth thing begin a curious correspondence, via notebook, in which they chronicle their reactions to the store, their pasts, and the terrifying possibility that 1) their lives may never transcend the superstore\u2019s aisles and/or 2) even if their lives did transcend the superstore\u2019s aisles, their experience with the fragility of the tolerable elements of existence is so pervasive they might be damaged permanently. These people are stuck and smart enough to realize the unstuck people are maybe just not perceptive enough to realize they\u2019re only a couple steps away from stuck themselves. So why get up in the morning? Well, there\u2019s Glove Pond , the man\u2019s novel that blossoms from the notebook exchange. And there\u2019s a trip to Europe for the girl that goes awry but transforms the girl in unexpected ways. And there are both a lack of easy answers and a surprising testament to the power of human beings to carry each other through the deadening American retail landscape. You know those people who say things like, \u201cYou know, you could get hurt, and your insurance could run out, and you could lose your job, and your whole life could fall apart.\u201d They\u2019re right. But that doesn\u2019t mean you hide under the covers (and I love hiding the covers, seriously) for the rest of your lives, because that\u2019s not living, either. The Gum Thief is essentially about whether or not you should hide under the covers or leave the house every day. The Gum Thief transcends hipster chatter and coheres in a manner that might escape quick or careless reading. This is a smart, tough novel that might look light and empty upon first glance, just like that register drone where you buy your pens might not look like she actually has a life beyond distributing change and helping you find report covers. I recommend it but maybe not combined with a Joy Division listening session or anything too harrowing. I\u2019m going to continue with his catalog this summer. ...more Ingenious. Clever.

But I do wanna say that, for me, the book's got a strong Seinfeldy/Larry David vibe. There's tons of general observations about everyday nothingness that evolve into epiphanies about the world we live in and/or philosophical rants. And most of the book is set in an office superstore which is a little like, \"who the fuck cares what goes on in a Staples?\" which reminded me of the Seinfeld where Jerry and George pitch their show to NBC as being \"about nothing.\" At one point I thought \"Hmm. That's sort of derivative, have to knock it down a star.\" Then I tried reading Bethany (one of the main characters) as Elaine Bennis, but it didn't work. So I realized that while it was reminiscent, it was still original, new...fresh! I found the characters relatable, likable, and real. Besides, nothing's born in a vacuum. Aside from all of that, the book's actually pretty dark. One of the things Coupland does so well in _The Gum Thief_ is transition from the everyday setting of bad lighting, shithead customers and gossipy teens to heavier issues like suicide, the loss of a child, drug abuse, illness, insanity, and heartbreak without even blinking. It's all so unbelievably believable. And, oddly, not a bummer at all. I don't know. I'm not sure what else to say about it. There's so much going on. You just have to read it for yourself. I read a negative review by a goodreader that suggested all the characters had the same voice: Coupland's. I didn't get that AT ALL. I mean, I think to have characters that work together, or are friends with each other, or are related to each other each have a voice or perspective so different from the other's would be not only off-putting, but unrealistic. I am a lot like the people I hang around for a reason: I like people who share a similar outlook on life and get my sense of humor. Other than that the reviewer complained the main character was too old to be goth. She's obviously never been to gothsinhotweather.com, or a Marilyn Manson concert. ...more This unassuming book is a tour-de-force.

Without mythologizing the quotidian, i.e. making our scummy human life seem romantic, and without dosing the whole enterprise with irony, Coupland manages to make something at once depressing and redeeming. For the first time in ages, I actually stopped reading the book 10 pages before the end just because I wanted to savor it. We have: great lead characters, working depressingly but not gratuitiously in a Staples. Great secondary characters, such as Rant Man. Great little observations, such as: why, when the Italians use red, green, and white, it looks deliciously Italian, and when Americans do it, it just looks like Christmas? We have lath-and-plaster prose finished with amazing sentences like this: \"She stepped out into what had become a night so cold it made the stars vibrate.\" We have a slice of bread being buttered, from the bread's point of view. We have characters who never actually interact with each other--because the novel consists of letters between them. We have a story within a story: GLOVE POND, which removes the dysfunction and misery of all the characters even further. We have, ultimately, an admission that most real people are more interesting than characters in novels, which is why Coupland keeps zooming back from the action--so in the end, the characters are, paradoxically, more real and even in their despair, more hopeful. It's as if Raymond Carver finally put down that bottle of scotch and tried to do something harder--and succeeded. As if Barack Obama said \"yes we can!\" and 250 million people believed him. As if the self-important deconstructionist age ended and people started to put some things together again, letter by letter.

I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted here illegally.) Like many writers of critical reviews, I too sometimes think about the idea of one day penning an entire book-long series of essays about a particular artist -- and of all the artists in history that now exist, the one I'm perhaps most qualified at this point to write an entire critical book about would be Canadian author Douglas Coupland; I've read eight of his eleven novels now, the majority of them multiple times, along with a handful of his nonfiction books, all the short pieces he's ever published, and several hundred interviews with him that have been conducted over the last 17 years, not to mention a memorable experience actually meeting him in the year 2000. (In a nutshell, while at a Chicago reading he became obsessed with the fact that I'm deaf in one ear, and actually stopped his reading in the middle of it to ask me all these strange random questions about it.) And in this I don't think I'm too terribly different than a large group of other people my age; after all, it was Coupland who wrote 1991's Generation X , the book that literally coined the term for the generation (my generation), the first book to teach all of us that it was okay to dream of a different world than the trippy hairy mess our aging hippie bosses had created, that it is in fact a generational duty. I mean, sure, that single book eventually led us to an entire decade of unnecessary body scarification, Kevin Smith films, and drag queens hosting afternoon talk shows, but that's not Coupland's fault for writing the novel that started it all. Or is it? See, that's the kind of essay I'd write, if I ever wrote a book of essays about Coupland; and it'd be a cool book, too, I'm telling you! That's why I was looking forward to reading through his latest, 2007's medium-sized and easily digestible The Gum Thief ; because the three novels of Coupland's that I haven't gotten to yet read, frankly, are the last three he's published (2003's Hey Nostradamus! , 2004's Eleanor Rigby and 2006's JPod ), not for any particular aesthetic reason but merely because I've been permanently broke throughout the 2000s, so I've been happily anticipating getting caught up with his ouevre ever since opening CCLaP a little less than a year ago. And indeed, The Gum Thief finds Coupland in fine if not terribly exciting form, just as is the case with the majority of his books; it'll take most people just a few days to get through it, and it provides exactly a few days worth of entertainment, a good matchup even while not exactly soaring to the heights of his absolute best work (so in other words, this is no Microserfs ). On the Coupland Scale of Weirdness, this definitely tips in on the dark, sad and bitter side; more Life After God than Shampoo Planet , more an examination of the endless failures of life than of its few successes. Because that's really the first thing to understand about Coupland, if you want a chance of deeply getting and enjoying his work; that he lives in this sorta little literary bubble of his own, where it's difficult to compare his plots and style and even way of working to any other writer except himself, and his books against any other books but his own. Coupland's world is a semi-surreal place but not a fully surreal one, a place where things just weird enough are always happening, events very much informed by popular culture and that are conveyed to us through the smooth, minimalist, elegant personal style that Coupland's past as an ad-agency copywriter has given him. It is not unusual within a Coupland story for time to stop, for apocalyptic events to take place, without any of these things being the main point of the story itself; Coupland's main point is always to examine the humanity inherent in each situation, even if it's a sometimes cold and irony-laced humanity that often has problems communicating with each other, and even if told in a much more clever and meta way than most character dramas are. This is certainly the case with The Gum Thief ; it is primarily the story of Roger, a middle-aged alcoholic who has just gone through a series of personal crises (divorce, death of a child, loss of a job), which now find him living in a basement studio apartment in a large anonymous city, sneaking vodka into his new day job as a clerk at office-supply store Staples just in order to make it through each soul-crushing day. Yeah, welcome to Coupland's world, chump! Because that's the thing that's often forgotten about his work, especially by his critics, or not even mentioned in the first place; that when Coupland is in a bad mood, he can be one of the most pathos-infused writers of our generation, painting portraits of human hopelessness and moral weakness that on the bleak scale fall just short of Russian epics about suicidal madmen in winter. The Gum Thief isn't a pleasant book, it isn't a pleasant book at all; it's a relentlessly grim and dour book, in fact, one that wallows in all the filth and garbage of the usual world, hoping merely that the fates of the various losers we meet along the way are somehow just a little bit better by the end, since \"good\" is too optimistic a fate to hope for. Because that's the other thing; as the story continues, of course, Roger ends up gathering a host of deeply flawed characters around him as well, all because of a notebook he accidentally leaves in the store's breakroom one day, in which he is writing new fictional character sketches based on his real co-workers and half-heartedly contemplating taking up the challenge again of becoming a published author. It's because of this notebook and these fictional character studies that he then comes to the attention of co-worker Bethany, an overweight goth girl in her early twenties who unfortunately had a plethora of friends and relatives accidentally die around her during childhood. This, then, has left Bethany unsure of herself, sarcastic and bitter about life, unable to trust or love the people around her; so in other words, a perfect match and foil for Roger, someone who starts leaving snotty rambling letters in his notebook that admonish him to never acknowledge them out loud to her while actually on the clock at the store. This then leads us to the main crux of the novel, which as usual with Coupland is a bit difficult to describe but enjoyable nonetheless. For example, partly this is about the growing complex relationship between Roger and Bethany, the way that their unspoken correspondence very slowly helps push each other to a point of awareness and healing they weren't at before. But also this is about the relationship between Roger and Bethany's mother DeeDee, yet another emotionally-scarred loser who it turns out had actually gone out with Roger on an dual-alcoholic date in the past, and who starts adding her own letters to the correspondence after finding out that Bethany and Roger have started conversing. But then, this is also the story of the new novel that Roger has been inspired by Bethany and DeeDee to sit down and finally write, a dreadful \"comedy\" called Glove Pond that is a transparent ripoff of Edward Albee's Who's Afraid of Virgina Woolf? ; and it's not just the story of the novel itself (large chunks of which are interspersed among the letters), but also how the people around him react to the novel, with to us it being pretty obvious that the novel is awful but with Bethany and DeeDee impressed because of neither being familiar with the Albee original. And because of all this literary trickery, of course, the book ends up becoming something else as well -- a meta story, that is, a story about stories about stories about stories, with there in actuality being hardly any \"real\" dialogue in The Gum Thief at all, but rather an entire manuscript's worth of letters and emails and office memos and diary entries and novel excerpts and the like. Now to be fair, there is also a fair dose here of all the things Coupland's critics complain about as well: over-reliance on pop-culture references, for one good example, a glib irony-worshipping writing style that is sure to turn a lot of people off right from the start. And Lord, don't even think about turning to a Coupland novel and expecting some sort of grand message, but rather be ready for a small story about small people that ultimately only says small and quiet things; this is why Generation X became as cultishly huge as it did, after all, is because Coupland never set out to write a book about an entire generation in the first place, but has admitted many times in interviews that he expected no one besides his own circle of friends to understand the point of the book at all. This is the sort of attitude you need to have about Coupland going into his novels, in order to truly appreciate them in a deep way; you need to see them as simple stories about specific people, but who by extension are then telling big stories about all of us in an untold way. And you need to go with Coupland down that road to get there, need to keep thinking about his ideas after the book itself is done; when you do this, he becomes much more than a MTV-friendly pop-culture guru, but actually a sophisticated chronicler of the human condition. That's why I keep reading Coupland and keep enjoying Coupland; it's why I ultimately recommend The Gum Thief as well, even though it will clearly never be thought of as one of Coupland's best. ...more This is the story of Steve and Bethany, pen pals and coworkers at Staples.

The book also contains a couple of Bethany's writing exercises from a creative writing class, and excerpts from Steve's unpublished novel \"Glove Pond\". These were fun to read and gave the book some much needed variation. All in all I enjoyed the letter format, and the topic of writing and becoming an author, which is discussed both by Steve and Bethany, and by the characters of \"Glove Pond\". As usual with Coupland, there's a prevalent feeling of nothingness and pointlessness encapsulating the character's lives, and both have bouts of depression throughout the novel. Steve and Bethany often discuss the hopelessness and lack of meaning that comes with working at shitty jobs in a polluted, consumerist world. It's quite dark, but interspersed with funny moments, witch was more or less what I expected when I bought it. Some passages I liked very much, they where beautifully written and poignant, and often based on everyday observations elevated to something more universal or philosophical - and usually very pessimistic. But the book falls short of being really good. There's just not enough substance there. Maybe that's the point, describing the nothingness of modern, urban life, but still. I much prefer Generation X to this one. ...more I love, and I mean LOVE, Douglas Coupland. There will always be a special place for him in my heart because he brought me clarity and a new life belief system in the form of Generation X. But sometimes he really pisses me off.

There are two things I hate this this world; racism and chewed up bubble gum. So why why why would I love, and I mean LOVE, Douglas Coupland.

So why why why would Douglas put a picture of chewed up bubble gum (bright pink, shiny, realistic looking, and I SWEAR, sticky, bubble gum) on the front and back of his new book? He's just mean. Anyway, the idea was good, the ending was interesting and I got sucked in somewhere in the middle. Douglas's true quirky voice comes out at some point, but if you've never read one of his books before, don't start with this one. And if you have read one of his books before, reread it. It's better.

Glove Pond showed us that even some of the most accomplished individuals are disasters too. Overall, a really fantastic read. This is just one of my favourite messages that Coupland imparts: \u201c\u2026maybe memories are like karaoke \u2013where you realize up on the stage, with all those lyrics scrawling across the screen\u2019s bottom, and with everybody clapping at you, that you didn\u2019t know even half the lyrics to your all-time favourite song. Only afterwards, when someone else is up on stage humiliating themselves amid the clapping and laughing, do you realize that what you liked most about your favourite song was precisely your ignorance of its full meaning \u2013and you read more into it than maybe existed in the first place. I think it\u2019s better to not know the lyrics to your life.\u201d (85) ...more I became a fan of Douglas Coupland's writing after I checked out Generation X from the library when I was in high school.

Most Coupland novels are full of unrealistic plot twists that somehow bind the characters. This book is more straightforward and realistic in its storyline. The novel is told through letters and writing samples that the characters share. And while it is touted on its sleeve as \"The first and only story of love and looming apocalypse set in the aisles of an office supply superstore,\" that doesn't quite adequately describe the feel of this novel. It is set in a Staples, but it is not about the looming apocalypse. The characters are struggling to dig through the doldrums of everyday life. They more concerned with being stuck in their current existence than overbearingly fearful of some impending doom. The love stories that seem to intertwine through the book are not the anchor of the characters' passions. Instead, between the book within the book and the exposes of correspondence, the main love for the characters is the cathartic act of writing. Overall, this novel reads as Coupland's most realistic novel in a long time. ...more Fall TV's big trend seems to involve people with pathetic, losery jobs at soulless chain stores ( Chuck , which is so far getting a tentative thumbs up from me, and Reaper , which I'm giving a big thumbs down).

This is interspersed with excerpts from Roger's work-in-progress novel, Glove Pond , which teeters amusingly on the edge between ridiculous and brilliant. I really enjoyed reading this. Coupland is, as always, amazingly good at looking into the minds of average, if somewhat quirky, people. He gives humanity to everyone; there are generally no villains in a Coupland novel, just various degrees of flawed people. I loved the relationship between Roger and Bethany and really enjoyed the weird, weird world of Glove Pond . I did think, however, that the narrative lags a bit once Bethany goes to England, and the book lacks the sense of catharsis at the end that many of Coupland's novels, even his overall weaker ones, have. Still, this is up there with my favorites of his, and continues to give me hope that he will one day produce something that's not just Really Good, but Transcendent. ...more This book is comprised of letters between employees at a Staples; Roger, the older guy & Bethany the goth teenager.

Trovo l\u2019immagine di copertina veramente azzeccata e si addice perfettamente alle sfumate di emozioni che lascia questo romanzo.

E\u2019 un romanzo- diario che tocca molte tematiche attuali, l\u2019alcolismo, il divorzio, la paura di diventare adulti, i vari fallimenti, il non piacersi, la mancata comunicazione\u2026. Ci si pu\u00f2 ritrovare in Roger, quarantenne divorziato che a causa di insuccessi e occasioni sfumate si ritrova solo, a fare il commesso per una catena di forniture per ufficio,con un sogno nel cassetto finire il suo romanzo iniziato quando era giovane, LO STAGNO NEL GUANTO. Qualcosa di costante nella sua vita c\u2019\u00e8, l\u2019alcol, il suo cane Wajne e un diario dove scrive e annota tutte le sue frustrazioni, paure e malumori. Oppure di contro, si ci pu\u00f2 ritrovare in Bethany, ragazza fragile, giovane, piena di paure che vede la morte sempre dietro di se. Collega di Roger, arrabbiata, insicura, come spesso le giovani donne sono. Interessante \u00e8 anche l\u2019aspetto emotivo che Coupland descrive in questo libro, della mamma di Bethany, DD, anche lei con ben tre divorzi alle spalle, una frana in quanto scegliere uomini e una forte preoccupazione per quella sua giovane figlia. Cerca di starle vicino pur, non sempre, condividendo le scelte della figlia. Osservandola da lontano come una mamma sa fare. Chiedendo, anzi scrivendo a Roger, consigli e preoccupazioni su ci\u00f2 che accade alla figlia. Il tutto inizia quando Bethany trova il famoso diario che Roger scrive, scritti in parte dal punto di vista di lei. Decide di rispondergli e inizia cosi una corrispondenza a tre voci, Roger, Bethany e DD. Danno vita cos\u00ec ad un carteggio segreto, intimo e surreale, che stimola Roger nel riprendere il suo romanzo in mano e rendere parallele le vite dei personaggi del romanzo con le loro. Il libro di Coupland \u00e8 un il ritratto dell\u2019uomo, delle sue fragilit\u00e0 insicurezze. E\u2019 lo stimolo a ritirarsi su e ricominciare dopo che si ha toccato il barato..il fondo.

I loved the unique, but easy to relate to characters. Their thoughts and dialogue often left me laughing out loud. I could genuinely sympathize with the characters and their situations while being highly entertained. Despite the hilarious observations made about people and the bizarre situations that presented themselves in this book, there were quite a lot of deep, often insightful truths revealed about life. I expected this book to be a light \"fluff\" read, but if you take the time to think about what is being said, it has a much more meaningful quality to it. Under the humorous exterior of The Gum Thief, there is a lot of deep exploration into human emotions and desires. Glove Pond, the novel within the novel, was very funny, and it also kept the pace of the novel from getting tedious. I enjoyed the little breaks in the main plot. The toast bits made me laugh a lot too. Those who have no idea what I'm talking about will understand once they have read it. Another great element of The Gum Thief is that Coupland filled it with nifty tidbits of information. I often found myself wondering whether something mentioned was true or not, which resulted in me rushing off to Google it. I enjoyed the format that the novel was written in, a series of journal entries and letters, because it kept the plot fast paced, yet comfortable. It was a well written book, and I thought it had a great flow. I would absolutely recommend this novel to anyone who likes to curl up with a good book! ...more There's a certain predictability to a Douglas Coupland novel. It's kind of like reading Vonnegut, or watching an episode of Law and Order. You know what you're going to get.

A lot of it felt a little formulaic, but at the same time, it's kind of like putting on an old, comfortable sweater. The story is one of despair at the local Staples. Seriously. It may sound silly, but it is very relatable, and a relatively satisfying read. The real interesting element of the novel, and I would argue that it is a continuation of an experiment Coupland first began in \"All Families are Psychotic\" is the playing around with metafiction. In AFaP, Coupland went the Paul Auster route - having a character with his own name, based pretty much on him - interesting, but not groundbreaking. This novel instead takes a metafiction meets Cheever sort of vibe - a novella in a novel, with the author as a character separate from his story (sort of). It's an interesting device, and in spite of the terrible name of the novella, it makes the novel that much better. I feel like I'm doing a Reading Rainbow review in that I've not answered much about the content of the novel - well, it's short. Read it yourself. It's very much in line with Microserfs, jPod, even shades of Shampoo Planet. And it's a hell of a lot better than Girlfriend in a Coma. ...more Unlike the other Coupland books I have read, in this one I was saying \"No, no, no\" while reading the first chapters. I did not like, or understand, or even believe in Roger, the main character.

It does not help that I did not like the \"meta-novel\" he interweaves with the main narrative, both in style and content, and although it is interesting as an exercise and to see how the author sees the inspiring characters, it was a chore to read. It lacks either the depth of Eleanor Rigby or the entertainment value of J-pod . It still reads mostly easily and draws some chuckles, but that is. Maybe I am not the target audience, as I could not empathize with the character's experiences. ...more I loved this book. I loved that most of it was set in my city. It was funny, clever, and well-written. The one thing I noticed was that the different characters in the book who were \"writing\" had too much of a similar style. The voices were not disparate enough. So good! A goth girl finds a coworker's journal in the breakroom at the Staples they work at. The middle aged man writes about his failed life and also pretends to be the goth girl. She writes back, he writes back, others get involved and things get weird and sweet. The first complaint that I have with this book concerns its 'book within a book' conceit. The main character, Roger, is writing a novel, 'Glove Pond', which is a not-even-trying-to-pretend-it's-not-a-knock-off of Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf. I struggle with these. You ever see Stranger Than Fiction? It was a fun movie but I just couldn't abide its premise hingeing on the author's novel being 'a masterpiece, but only if he dies'. This put me in mind of that. It's just not any good. You could a The first complaint that I have with this book concerns its 'book within a book' conceit.

You ever see Stranger Than Fiction? It was a fun movie but I just couldn't abide its premise hingeing on the author's novel being 'a masterpiece, but only if he dies'. This put me in mind of that. It's just not any good. You could argue that it's not supposed to be (Roger is after all an amateur writer whose day job is at an office supplies store) - but that's not really acceptable when the book-within-a-book takes up such a large portion of the book. Ultimately I feel Coupland should not have approached this as an epistolary novel. It's constructed in the form of letters and notes and various pages shared between the characters - chiefly Roger, a 40-something divorcee with a drinking problem, and Bethany, a 20-something goth girl with a high school diploma, working at an office supplies store. The trouble was in the execution, not in the idea itself. The characters' writing voices are not distinct from one another. Sometimes I had to flip back a page or two to check who was meant to be the writer of the current letter. Oddly enough, they all wrote as if they'd rather be a third person narrator. Maybe they should have been? I did like Bethany's character. I liked her naive choices, her various attempts to hide herself, her obvious desire to care about something mingled with a fear of showing it. Her mother's anxiety and guilt was very real. The characters were actually quite authentically drawn; their choices and histories and the things they found funny. If only they could speak with their own voices. ...more The Gum Thief initially seems to be about what all of Canadian writer Douglas Coupland's other books are about: lives of quite desperation and absurdity that is modern living.

It is thus refreshing when you discover that thus book juts might be an examination of the act of writing itself. A a series of diary entries, letters, and even installements of a novel-within-a-novel, it all begins when Roger, a divorced, alcoholic middle aged worker on the fars track to nowhere at staionery store Staples, writes a diary entry about his terrible life, ranting about everything from not investing in Microsoft to people who flash their ights on the freeway. \"At least if you're bitter, you know that you're like everybody else,\" he says. This is followed by a diary sccount of Bethany, a plump, Goth co-worker, \"the dead girl whose locker you spat on somewhere between recess and lunch.\" However, we soon discover that this is not really Bthany's diary, but that Roger is impersonating her -- presumably in some sort of writerly exercise. But when he leave his journal lying around in the staff room, Bethany finds it, and instead of being angry, starts a secret epistolary correspondence with him, like two spies in enemy territory: \"Remember, no acknowledging to my face that you've read this.\" They open up on the trauma of their lives -- his divorce and the death of his son, the death of various of her family members, presenting convincing if unsurprising portraits of how two people came to be as wounded and defeated as these characters are. Their correspondence is interspersed with extracts from Roger's novel-in-progress, which he has been inspired to work on upon encouragemnet from Bethany. Titled Glove Pond, it is about a faded author-turned-academic and his eccentric actress wife, who play host to a hot young writer and his surgeon wife. The novel -- which Roger himself summarises as \"all the charactres were crazy and humanity was doomed\" -- are ornately and amusing cheesy, yet have their momemts of transcendence, mirroring as they do the actual events playing out in the lives of Roger and Bethany. As the hot young wrter character muses about the couple characters at one point: \"What, he wondered, could have happened to two people to damage them so badly? What sort of event could warp them, or any of us, to the point where they became mere cartoons of the real and whole people they once were?\" But such moments are not enough to transcend this book's writing-exercise neatness -- which, to give Coupland credit, might have been his intention. Most of the characters sound the same -- snarky and self-deprecating -- while, at the risk of giving things away, the twist at the end is less Life Of Pi and more \"It was all a dream\". ...more

Sure, it wasn't as good but I still loved it. I went back to the beginning and then read Generation X and, whatdoyaknow, it is one of my all-time favorites.

So, decades late, Coupland is becoming one of my favorite authors. I also seem to see his 'periods'; Early, middle, and late Coupland. The Gum Thief is a late Coupland book but is basically identical to Microserfs in structure. And, thankfully, it is almost equal in excellence. Coupland has this way of making things I truly hate about literature be entertaining. I really should think he is a pretentious snob but I actually become fully engrossed in his dream-like narratives, less run by plot and more by raw emotion, pop psychology and stream of consciousness. The Gum Thief ups the ante a bit by having a novel within the novel that is pretty fun and runs parallel, thematically, with the main action. Plus, unlike the other three books I've read of his, there is an actual ending!!!! And it feels satisfying (other reviews point out that is not a supported claim). In place of overworked computer programmers or fringe-homeless living in the desert, The Gum Thief focuses on Staples employees and the tragedies and frailties of their lives. The Gum Thief is certainly the most pessimistic of Coupland's books I've read ... every character is either recovering from immense tragedy or realizing their youth is dying (or has already died) ... but it is also as close to real, at least for my experience, then the other four. Yes, Microserfs actually made me cry but that book had a dream-like, not-quite-existing in reality reality to it ... while this book, though taking liberties of course, feels like a more honest look at being human. This might not be the first Coupland book to pick up if you've never read him ... nor, honestly, is it his best ... but is is damned good. ...more Just a warning: I haven't reviewed things much so I apoligies in advance if this review is awful.

From the begining it gets you thinking about your own life and there's plenty of moments in this book that you can relate to yourself. It had me thinking more and more about how I'm getting older and doing nothing with my life, that if I don't do something about it I will end up like Roger. A grumpy middle aged person who is working at a low paid job like staples and that will be all I'll ever amount to. Another thing this book made me think about is how much I want to write to people because all this texting and messaging has made us so lazy. I want to go back to having the personal feel of reading a letter and all the things they write to you (oh wow, I just made myself sound like I'm about 70, haha. 46 years to go till then). There were moments when I found this book hilarious (so did my boyfriend as I heard him laughing manically to himself when reading some of this book), there were times when I felt sadness and really felt for these characters. But occasional times I couldn't connect so much with them. But it was very occasional so wasn't much of an issue. I also enjoyed the story glove pond and even though it was terrible I wanted to know what was going to happen next. I personally think Douglas Coupland did a good job with adding that story into the book without us getting lost with what was going on with that and the main story. I've read reviews for this book and have seen that a lot of fans aren't so impressed with this book compared to Douglas' other book. If this is the case, this is the first book of his I read but certainly won't be the last. I really enjoy his style of writing and will be looking forward to reading more of his books. ...more I\u2019ve always admired the fact that Douglas Coupland can exploit metafiction and postmodern absurdity while still remaining within the limits of \u2018commercial fiction\u2019.

But, with The Gum Thief , Coupland seems to have gotten tired of playing by the rules of commercial fiction. The novel is unashamedly full of tricksy postmodernism and characters that are obstinate and unlikeable. There are no dramatic set pieces or surges of emotion. The Gum Thief is a story within a story within a story \u2013 and none of those stories provide the easy satisfaction that comes when a good plot is tied up in a neat bow. The novel is, ostensibly, about an aging, alcoholic, would-be author, who works at Staples and begins exchanging letters with a goth co-worker. In fact, this is merely a frame that allows Coupland to skewer the pretensions of the writing profession. Writers are ripe for satire, but even I \u2013 who has observed or experienced many of the things that Coupland satirizes, such as ridiculous creative writing exercises and lauded authors who haven\u2019t written a word in years \u2013 found the subject an insubstantial basis for a novel. The Gum Thief is well-written, well-observed and frequently amusing. But, ultimately, there\u2019s no there there. The characters are hard to engage with; the storyline is nonexistent. It\u2019s as pointless a read as all the writing exercises that come out of creative writing classes. ...more The Gum Thief, in my opinion, is Coupland's best since Hey Nostradamus!, which means a lot since HN! is one of my favorite books of all time.

Well, enough about what I think. Here's a quick plot summation so you can figure out what this book is about: The Gum Thief follows Roger Thorpe, a mid-40's burnout working a customer service job at a Staples. He is divorced, still in shock from the death of one of his children, and trying to find meaning in a life that's over half gone. In a strange way, he befriends Bethany, an overweight Goth co-worker of his. Their friendship consists of taking turns writing entries in Roger's diary, espousing their fears about life, death, and try to attach meaning to seemingly meaningless nuances. But Bethany makes the rule that they have to act like they don't know each other around the store. The novel is in the form of written communication, whether it's Roger and Bethany's diary entries, letters from Roger's ex-wife, letters from Bethany's mom, Staples co-workers, or Roger's novel-in-progress, Glove Pond. The Gum Thief is about looking for meaning in life, loneliness, the effects of growing older, and the way writing communicates more about our lives than we would say to each other in person. A work of amazing emotional depth, one that I will be musing over for days to come, and one that I will keep on the shelf to read again one day. ...more Give me back my precious time, Douglas Coupland!!
