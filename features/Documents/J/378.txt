MAN ... Your enemies don't come more dripping with macho-awesomeness than that!! This second installment of Iggulden\u2019s Conqueror trilogy begins several years following the events of Genghis: Birth of an Empire . In the first book, we followed Genghis from his formative, early years through the moment when he begins uniting the various Mongol tribes under his rule of manliness. As I stated previously in my review of that first installment, Iggulden does a superior job of making this complex, enigmatic figure come to life. This second installment maintains the high standards of the first. Inspire of that, I didn't quite enjoy this as much as Genghis: Birth of an Empire , but I think that was more a result of my fussy, unreasonable expectations than any patent failure of quality in the text itself. I shall explain. As I mentioned above, the first book ended with Genghis having begun to unite the various warring tribes into a unified nation. Based on how the first novel ended, I was all revved up and geared in excitement for this book to commence the description of the giant, \"out to the woodshed\" ass-kicking that Genghis unleashed on the world. I was all expecting the firm smack down of some \u00a0enemy ass followed by a segue into Genghis pillaging some enemy villages (<---B>after kicking some more enemy ass</---B>). From there, the narrative was to transition into Genghis stomping some cities into the ground (immediately following another stellar game of stomp the enemy\u2019s naughty bits ). After that, we would move into Genghis pummeling more enemies into submission...followed by brief pauses, after plundering a few wealthy towns, to get really, really, really, really drunk and debauched at an impromptu \u201cGenghis is Awesome\" celebration. ....then it would be right back to killing and maiming the enemy, expanding the Mongol empire (after capping some more enemies) and finally, after all the asses have been kicked, to climax with a brief segment of taking names , the traditional post-ass-kicking activity. Unfortunately, Iggulden decided to take a more measured and less nut stomping pace to the narrative, which caused me some initial moments of melancholy. However, Iggulden's breezy style and well-crafted plot quickly drew me in and I found myself hooked again by the unveiling of this incredible historical figure's momentous life. Before starting this series, I knew next to nothing about Genghis, which shocks and appalls me given his impact on the world. I have found him prior to be a fascinating figure and one that on many levels I admire greatly. Now hold up John and Jenny \"Jump-the-Gun\" , don\u2019t go getting me wrong and thinking I condone all of Genghis's actions. He \u00a0was certainly ruthless to his enemies and, at times, conducted wholesale slaughter of those he conquered. It's also true that he was clearly the aggressor and that his campaign was offensive rather than defensive. \u00a0HOWEVER, in analyzing his actions from the perspective of his own beliefs and motivations, I came to at least understand (even if I did not fully condone) Genghis Khan\u2019s actions. From Genghis\u2019s perspective, the neighboring empires, including the Kingdom of the Xi Xia and the Chin or Chinese Empire, had been responsible for keeping the various Mongol tribes fighting and killing each other for centuries. The Chin had also conducted numerous raids and similar acts of belligerence \u00a0against the Mongols. Thus, when Genghis united the tribes, part of his motivation was to be able to create a force strong enough to destroy these two enemies in order to secure safety and freedom for his own people. \u00a0Not exactly a monstrous goal. Now, I admit, that may not be a perfect justification for starting an aggressive war or even as good as say...I don\u2019t know...claiming that \u00a0the Xi Xia and the Chin were harboring WMDs. However, I still think that Genghis Khan\u2019s desire to create freedom and safety for his people shows his later actions in a different light even if you don\u2019t agree with his decision to invade Iraq Xi Xia. In addition, the book describes how Genghis usually offered his enemies the option of surrendering before he attacked. \u00a0Of course, if this offer was refused, he would be ruthless to those who refused upon his eventual victory. However, even that was for the purpose of encouraging future enemies to willingly surrender. A cold, calculating decision, yes. But not necessarily bloodthirsty. Genghis is also portrayed as being extremely loyal to those who follow him and inspiring tremendous loyalty in return. He lavishly rewarded those who fought with him and took care of the families of those who died in battle. He cared about his people deeply, and they in turn cared deeply for him. I think this above all else is something I greatly admired about the man as I think inspiring love and loyalty is always worthy of recognition. In summary, while Genghis Khan\u2019s reputation as a bloodthirsty conqueror is not without a basis in fact, I think that Iggulden has shown him to have been a much more layered, multi-faceted historical figure. He had many noble qualities and was a superb leader of men, maybe among the best ever. He was also loved by his people and had understandable motives behind the actions that he took. Though certainly not perfect, I certainly think Gene Roddenberry should have received a bottom-smacking for placing such a great leader in this motley group: in sum, this book was well written, well paced and superbly detailed. I'm looking forward to reading the final volume in the trilogy about this larger than life historical figure. In closing, here are a few famous quotes ascribed to Genghis (Conan fans will recognize the first one): 3.5 to 4.0 stars. Highly Recommended. ...more My review for the first book: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... My review for the third book: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...

(2) the Chi Empire (in other translation: the Jin Empire) and the Xi Xia Empire/Tangut Empire did not share the same ancestor. (3) there is a 'Buddhist monk' Yao Shu in the novel, but historically Yao Shu is a Taoist. (4) historically the Xi Xia Emperor at Genghis Khan's time is called Li Anquan ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor... ), the 'Xi Xia Emperor' in this novel is totally made up. Actual review here: In this book, we follow Genghis Khan, his brothers and his warrior buddies on a quest to conquer more land across Asia! Since this series was written on the view point of Genghis and the Mongol Empire, therefore the Chi Empire and their royal family are more or less being painted as the 'bad guys' (the author reasons that the Chi Emperor was responsible for the death of Genghis' father), still fortunately the author didn't rely too much on such justification. I mean.........perhaps the Chi Emperor had done some dark things, but it really isn't like Genghis and his buddies are any more merciful or righteous. In this book Genghis is still the main character, and his family dramas (mostly the tension he had with his chief wife B\u00f6rte and his oldest son Jochi) also foreshadows the undercurrents within the ruling family, which lead to the many major events and plot twists in the sequel. Beside Genghis, I like how his brothers are having more roles to play instead of being the mere followers of Genghis in the previous book. For example, I like Qasar and Tem\u00fcge's quest to the Chi Empire and how the brothers meet up with new, unfamiliar friends/foes, deal with the new surrounding and new challenges. Not to mention, Lords of the Bow also ends with yet another heart-stopping epic battle (once again I'm impressed!) Genghis' general Subutai ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subutai ) also has more role to play in this book, and the general will take on an important role in the sequel. Reading Mr. Iggulden's novels really help me to experience the charms of historical novels (I'm not a huge fan of this genre, mind you), my knowledge on Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire is mostly from what I'd read in my highschool textbooks, but Mr. Iggulden and his story successfully manage to breath life into all those impassive historical details. I really appreciate what the author had done with his works. PS: but please bear in mind that many of the historical details in this series aren't exactly accurate. ...more Genghis Khan continues uniting the Mongol tribes and takes them across the Gobi Desert into the lands of the Chin.

Genghis's relationship with his family was well done, particularly with Jochi, whose parentage is in doubt. The way he interacts with his brothers humanizes him a bit and makes him more than a cold military leader. He's even funny at times, afraid of his two wives becoming closer. The budding hatred between Joshi and Chagatai sets up elements in the next book. Iggulden makes the siege of Yenking and the battle of Badger Mouth pass sweaty-palmed page turners. I'm hoping the third and final book has its share of epic battles. A lot of people complain that Iggulden plays fast and loose with the facts. I scoff at that notion. The differences are where the fiction part of historical fiction comes into play. If you want history, read a history book. If you read Birth of an Empire, you won't want to pass this one up. ...more This was a gripping page-turner. 3.7 stars.

Esse segundo volume come\u00e7a alguns anos ap\u00f3s o anterior, quando Temujin havia acabado de se anunciar como Genghis e come\u00e7ado a juntar as tribos em prol de um objetivo maior. Liderados por Genghis e seus homens de confian\u00e7a, mais de 70.000 guerreiros mong\u00f3is atravessam o \u00e1rido Deserto de Gobi em dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s terras chinesas, buscando vingan\u00e7a total contra os seus inimigos do passado. E \u00e9 nessa hora que a figura de Genghis faz uma tremenda diferen\u00e7a. Historicamente rivais, a maioria das tribos mong\u00f3is ainda possuem as suas desaven\u00e7as, criando alguns conflitos aqui e ali que precisam ser resolvidos com a aud\u00e1cia e implacabilidade do grande khan. Um homem que n\u00e3o tolera trai\u00e7\u00f5es , que far\u00e1 de tudo para proteger seu povo e a sua ideia de uma na\u00e7\u00e3o mongol unida. \u201cBehold a people shall come from the north, and a great nation. They shall hold the bow and the lance; they are cruel and will not show mercy; their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses every one put in array, like a man to the battle.\u201d \u201cIt is done. We are a nation and we will ride. Tonight, let no man think of his tribe and mourn. We are a greater family and all lands are ours to take.\u201d O discurso de Genghis Khan para os seus comandados no come\u00e7o do livro \u00e9 algo digno de se citar, acredito que todo leitor se arrepiar\u00e1 lendo as palavras do conquistador e a confian\u00e7a que ele tem. Nessa sequ\u00eancia, finalmente percebemos a import\u00e2ncia do arco para as estrat\u00e9gias dos mong\u00f3is . Os guerreiros montados a cavalo, que aprendem a ficar firmes na sela e usar o arco mortalmente desde que s\u00e3o crian\u00e7as, tornam-se uma for\u00e7a brutal nas fileiras do ex\u00e9rcito de Genghis, estra\u00e7alhando os inimigos mais fracos e que ainda n\u00e3o aprenderam a combater a efic\u00e1cia da cavalaria mongol o suficiente para fazer frente ao avan\u00e7o de Genghis. Cidade ap\u00f3s cidade, os mong\u00f3is come\u00e7am a devastar o territ\u00f3rio chin\u00eas e s\u00f3 param ao avistar Yenking (atual Pequim), uma cidade com muralhas grossas e alt\u00edssimas, tornando-se um obst\u00e1culo de peso para a na\u00e7\u00e3o mongol. O inverno tamb\u00e9m est\u00e1 ali para atrapalhar e adiar um pouco o avan\u00e7o dos mong\u00f3is, mas um plano de Genghis pode garantir uma vit\u00f3ria na Boca do Texugo, um desfiladeiro cercado dos dois lados por montanhas alt\u00edssimas e incapazes de ser escaladas, segundos os chineses. E \u00e9 exatamente l\u00e1 que os dois ex\u00e9rcitos travar\u00e3o uma batalha ferrenha, com algumas consequ\u00eancias para ambos os lados. Focando um pouquinho mais nos dramas familiares de Genghis, percebemos tamb\u00e9m o seu esc\u00e1rnio com Jochi, filho mais velho e que parece n\u00e3o ser seu, fruto de um estupro que sua esposa Borte sofreu quando foi capturada pelos t\u00e1rtaros, que acabaram sendo dizimados pela f\u00faria de Genghis. Tamb\u00e9m deu pra perceber um leve toque \"sobrenatural\" nesse segundo volume de O Conquistador , com alguns shamans aparecendo e dando o seu toque de magia negra na trama, conquistando poder em meio \u00e0 grande tribo e deixando alguns guerreiros apreensivos com o seu s\u00fabito crescimento. Genghis Khan est\u00e1 se tornando um dos meus personagens preferidos , e eu temo pelo dia que lerei as p\u00e1ginas dos pr\u00f3ximos livros e terei que dar adeus a esse vision\u00e1rio. Os traumas de seu passado est\u00e3o sempre presentes, principalmente o momento em que ele e Kachiun (na vida real foi Khasar) se juntaram para matar Bekter, o irm\u00e3o mais velho que estava roubando comida da fam\u00edlia e deixando-os passar fome. Voc\u00eas j\u00e1 pararam para imaginar a for\u00e7a de esp\u00edrito que algu\u00e9m precisa ter para fazer isso? Matar o pr\u00f3prio irm\u00e3o! S\u00e3o atitudes como essa que moldaram a personalidade forte de Genghis e o fizeram ser conhecido at\u00e9 hoje como o maior conquistador de toda a Hist\u00f3ria. \u201cWhat is the purpose of life if not to conquer? To steal women and land? I would rather be here and see this than live out my life in peace.\u201d Uma narrativa que \u00e9 praticamente imposs\u00edvel n\u00e3o gostar, cheia de momentos tensos e frases impactantes, sem contar que Genghis Khan \u00e9 um personagem fora de s\u00e9rie, temido e impiedoso, mas cruel apenas com seus inimigos. Essa \u00e9 uma daquelas s\u00e9ries que eu certamente lerei at\u00e9 o fim! ...more This books starts off with Genghis completing his subjugation of the Mongol tribes under his banner before marching on his hated enemies, the Chin, and we end at the walls of Yanjing (Beijing) There are a lot of large set piece battles this book, but most notable was the battle of Badger Mouth where the Mongols bypassed the choke point by climbing what the Chin thought were impassable peaks - especially in winter.

I think I liked Genghis coming of age story in the first book better because we got a real close up view of the man himself and his personal prowess. This book we step back a bit from the legend to encompass his army, his war tactics, and his success and failures on the battlefield. They are still very interesting but I can't help comparing Iggulden's battle descriptions with Bernard Cornwell. Cornwell's battles just seem that more in depth. Then again, Iggulden is using broader strokes to propel the reader swiftly across events covering years rather than days or weeks. One of the interesting things I found was how the Mongols didn't really seem to have a plan for what to do when they had finished conquering their enemies - other than to go back home. And it seems their cohesion relied heavily on war, but with no grand vision of what to build in peace time.

While I was aware of the story of his childhood and his early years, I knew very little of his exploits as a war chieftain. While I was aware that he was successful in bringing together disparate Mongolian tribes I was unaware of the sheer ferociousness and determination of these warriors. This volume tells of the earliest years of his conquests. Genghis Khan had no formal education. He was not trained in leadings massive armies of warriors and was trained in tactics used by small raiding parties. Lords of the Bow paint a picture of a man who possessed natural genius for warfare, an innate ability to lead and the intelligence to seek out knowledge necessary to defeat the enemy Plot summary In this second volume, we follow Genghis on his early campaigns to fight the Chin (Chinese) dynasty. A band of 60,000 mongol warriors, newly formed in a community that violated the ancient tribal of governance of the Mongol people, set themselves against and ancient and advanced civilization. The plot weaves epic battles with a staggering number of combatants with Genghis` quest to obtain and use his enemies knowledge to defeat them. The Good Are you Ready to Rumble! The battles described in the volume, especially the final battle, can be described in one word, EPIC. In these early years, Genghis was able to use his force of 60,000 warriors and the Chinese belief that the Mongol Tribes were weak and disorganized, to its full advantage. In early battles, he used the vast size of his army to overwhelm any city in his path. The final battle in this volume takes place between Genghis` army and the army of Yenking (now modern day Beijing) and the surrounding cities. The author paints a vivid picture of the nearly insurmountable task of the taking the city. Not only was the city wall nearly impenetrable, the entrance to the city plane was through a narrow passage and between a mountain range. The efforts that Genghis army took to besiege the city and fight the army was extraordinary. If nothing else, read the book for the account of this battle alone. Its all in the Detail The author has a wonderful eye for detail. This is not a story of crazed and bloodthirsty Mongols bent on world domination. This is the story of a man. We are afforded a look into the life Genghis Khan but are also in the surrounding cultures and customs. For example, there is a scene where Genghis and his warriors enter an opulent home in a Chinese city. The Mongol warriors have spent their entire life in open plains and living in gers. The author points out that the would have likely felt uncomfortable and unsettled with high ceilings, large rooms and slaves. It is these small details that round out this novel. The Bad What about Bob (and Borte) There is a large cast of characters that are important in the story of Genghis Khan. His wife, Borte, was an important figure in the first book and she was the reason he made many of his early decisions. While the relationship with his brothers continues to be explored, the relationship with his own children and wife is not. For someone that was so affected by his relationship with his own father, I am interested in Genghis the Father and husband. Hopefully this will be explored in later volumes. Final Thoughts While I enjoyed the book, it lacked the overall excitement of the first book. While the siege on Yenking was epic, large portions of the book were left to scheming, planning and searching out people to teach them that which they did not know. Overall, this volume paints a picture of a far sighted man who was prepared to go to some amazing lengths to reach his goal. I am excited to read the rest of the story of Genghis Khan. Content Advisories It is difficult to find commentary on the sex/violence/language content of book if you are interested. I make an effort to give you the information so you can make an informed decision before reading. *Disclaimer* I do not take note or count the occurrences of adult language as I read. I am simply giving approximations. Scale 1 - Lowest 5 - Highest Sex - 2.5 Part of the warrior culture in these books and at this time allowed the victors to take their liberties with the women of vanquished enemies. There is discussion of rape on multiple occasions but there are no graphic incidents. There is a minor sex scene in which sex is implied. There are several other discussions related to sex but overall they are not graphic. Language - 2 There is very little use of what the average reader would consider traditional adult language. There is certainly name calling and phases that would be considered insulting in the context of the culture. Violence - 4 Violence is a major theme in the book. I reduced the rating for the second volume and it was not pervasive as in the first. This volume included far more planning a scheming and less fighting. They violence is not as graphic as in the first novels. There are scenes in which a character is abusive to a woman that are mildly graphic. There is a scene of mass suicide.

I just had to get past the idea of hanging onto even the slightest shred of 21st century Western ideas like, oh...\"killing people that are different from you is a bad thing.\" It's just not really relevant to this story of these people, and you gotta get past that. Literally no one in these books is what you'd consider a \"good guy\". The breach & sacking of entire cities is seen as a necessity, and even a fun and/or challenging one at that. Iggulden doesn't shy away from portraying the realities Genghis Khan's conquering swathe across Eurasia, and yet seems to delight in creating likable characters on the receiving side of the Mongol conquest. It's just difficult to know where I stand in these books, which is weird. On one hand, it's fascinating and occasionally awe-inspiring to hang out around the Mongols and see them in a fictional light. On the other, how can I root for a Mongol leader over a Xi Xia leader when the Xi Xia are the ones defending their homes? Some interesting ethical arguments are presented, but even if I wasn't convinced it's always a thoroughly entertaining story. Anyways...this book opens with Genghis completing his forced unification of the steppe tribes and from then on consists solely of his interactions (read: wars) with the Xi Xia (read: Tangut) and Chin (read: Jin) Empires. The perspective of the book flits through a decently-sized cast of people, most Genghis and the people around him but including aforementioned perspectives of Xi Xia leaders and citizens. This gives the book a roomy quality, which is a very good thing with a story with the epic nature of the insanely widespread Mongol conquests. If it isn't obvious by now, this is a full-fledged war story and most of the book follows the particulars of the Mongol migration/campaigns. Sieges and battles abound, giving the reader the first look in this series at what the Mongols could do when they were fighting other nations. As such, the battle scenes are appropriately long, tense and bloody. Some memorably terrifying shit goes down in this one, most notably Badger Mouth, a battle that saw a vastly outnumbered Mongol army attack a huge, well-trained Jin horde through the fort-laden natural bottleneck of a mountain pass. How does Genghis deal with such an unfavorable situation? Read and find out! There do seem to be a few things that I just don't get from Iggulden's writing. He does make an effort with the characters, but somehow the whole thing seems...I don't know, a bit dispassionate or disconnected. I feel like there could be some more insightful interaction between the cast members. It probably has to do with the military setting and the relatively broad perspective...you just never get enough time with anyone for them to see a forceful personality, aside from Genghis and maybe a couple other characters. Kokchu was interesting, if weird and gross. Genghis' brothers Kachiun and Khasar were basically the same person. Jochi certainly grabbed my sympathy. Also, I would have liked a bit more cultural information about not only the Mongols but the different Chinese nations in the book. Again, perhaps not the best place to expect these things but they would have presented a more well-rounded reading experience on top of the constant riding around feathering motherfuckers and then burning their shit. I'm hardly a Mongol expert but I know there was more to their society and their people than that. I definitely have a positive opinion of this man's writing now. I thought the first of his Rome series was really bad, but after a weird start with this one I'm certainly on board with the Mongol series...due to procrastination I'm halfway through Bones of the Hills and am liking that one too. Anyone interested in Genghis and the other Khans should give this series a shot, especially if you're interested in the actual execution of their conquests and their almost unbeatable military machine. There's a decent amount of domestic intrigue and drama as well, but this really is a bunch of well-written scenes of dudes riding thousands of miles, subsisting on nothing but a mixture of mare's milk and blood, and then shooting literally EVERYONE with double-curved bows. If that sounds interesting to you, check it out--but don't miss the first Genghis book, which is one of the few coming-of-age stories not only tolerated but liked. ...more Of all the authors I've read, I say Conn Iggulden holds the place as having the best writing style. He has nearly mastered the art of writing because he knows what to write and how to write it. (One can never master language. There's always another angle to set this complex gift of God.) Writing is sometimes like cooking, and he knows just how much of each ingredient he should add. The story is not weighed down with description, yet the writing is not dull.

He has nearly mastered the art of writing because he knows what to write and how to write it. (One can never master language. There's always another angle to set this complex gift of God.) Writing is sometimes like cooking, and he knows just how much of each ingredient he should add. The story is not weighed down with description, yet the writing is not dull. His characters are realistic and the history is closely matched. Iggulden is so good at what he does, his books are like a film - with professional actors. It's colorful, and gray in a vivid way (doesn't the 1100s Mongol sound gray to you too?) At times I could have been there on the plains with Genghis and Kachiun and Khasar... He also finds historical events with enough action to give his stories glint and excitement. A bonus to him because it's hard to delve into Sumerian novels with almost no plot. I even heard him say he picks the most interesting events that have happened. Conn Iggulden taught English for seven years and it's evident. The man is extremely underrated! ...more Fascinating insight into the mindset of the world's greatest conquerer in written history.

It does seem that the world has always been squarely divided into the the outsider(people of the steppe) and the insider(city dwellers), with the outsider always wanting a piece of the insider's assets. ...more Conn Iggulden's masterful writing skills make this book a joy to read. The author maintains as much of the historical fidelity as possible and fills in the gaps where needed. If the first book of the series covered Genghis' troubled youth, in Lords of the Bow we see a full grown leader on a warpath. Although the scenes described are often extremely violent they only attempt to give us an idea of life and death in the 13th century and they help build the image of Genghis Khan. A leitura foi um pouco mais arrastada do que a do primeiro. O ritmo melhora da metade pro final. At times I was disappointed with this book. After Iggulden spent so much time in the last one building up the character of young Genghis Kahn - and making him sympathetic - there was surprisingly little personal development here. We had a couple of scenes with him and his sons, but little more. I also struggled to understand why we followed Temuge for so much of this story around Baotou, when he didn't actually do anything other than follow Khasar and feel scared a lot.

I also struggled to understand why we followed Temuge for so much of this story around Baotou, when he didn't actually do anything other than follow Khasar and feel scared a lot. However, the way the writing co-ordinated simultaneous viewpoints for the attack on Badger Pass was masterful. Additionally, it's clear that we're no longer supposed to focus only on Genghis, but also his brothers, and there was enough to leave me intrigued as to what they'd do next. Once I finally accepted that I was better able to relax and enjoy it. Iggulden writes with such an easy manner that it was hard to put down, and in the end I'm glad I continued. In the meantime, I'm still interested enough to see how this series develops, so I'll be returning to it again soon enough. ...more See review of Genghis: Birth of an Empire .

this book as much as it's predecessor. That's not to say that I didn't like it. It is well written and very interesting. The first problem was that there just wasn't enough Genghis Khan in this book.

My second issue was with the battle scenes. Not many people can write a good battle scene (by good I mean understandable enough for a moron like me to follow). Many reviewers compare Mr. Iggulden with the god of historical fiction, Bernard Cornwell. However Mr. Cornwell is the master of writing a coherent, AND INTERESTING battle scene. I've never gotten lost fighting along side Uhtred of Bebbenburg or Le Bastard, Sir Thomas Vexille of Hookton. Mr. Iggulden loses me from the first bending of a bow. He is one of those authors who likes to tell a battle from both sides, constantly switching back and forth! Always an interesting idea but rarely effective in storytelling. So much bitching, so little time. In short, despite its irritating issues this book is still fun and worth reading. The story is there and I do enjoy following Genghis Khan rise to conquer the world. Also, the end of this book is very gratifying. RECOMMENDED. ...more I probably didn't make it clear in my review of Wolf Of The Plains , that I felt that a large part of my enjoyment of that book derived from reading it in the steppe.

So, far better then to wait until I was next in the steppe to read the second, right? In spite of my location, this book has now joined a very small elite group of novels that I just cannot bring myself to finish. I made it through the first couple of chapters but eventually I was forced to give up. I haven't read a book in which I was told how a character is feeling about something in every sentence since I don't know when - certainly not as an adult. Whether this is the dive in quality after the first book that I imagine it to be I don't know but it's bad enough to make sure I don't read any of the others in the series. For the first time in a long time, reading became something I dreaded rather than looked forward to with this book. ...more The brilliant second installment of the Conqueror series Having united the tribes into the unified nation of Mongols, Genghis Khan and his brothers lead their great army into the land of the Chin.

Keeping the tribes united is a difficult task and relies upon the brains of the great khan combined with his, sometimes shocking, ruthlessness. It works. There are many sub-adventures, and there are new surprises for the reader around every corner. The only constant is the cunning plotting of the shaman, Kokchu, who is feared by all, even Genghis. Once again, Conn Iggulden sweeps the reader along with his wonderful descriptive story-telling. The only disappointment for me is that, having finished this book, I am going to have to wait for the third and final instalment. ...more This book was a huge surprise for me because I really wasn't into the first book in this series (this being book 2).

Rating 4* out of 5. This was really good, although it did not quite live up to the first book. Part of the reason for this is that Genghis Khan takes on a bit of super human quality and does not feel as real in this installment. Nonetheless, this is a very solid historical semi-fiction and superbly readable. Minus one star for all the battles.

Solo cos\u00ec la nostra vita diventa un lampo di luce in grado di rischiarare le tenebre per molte vite future. Molto bello anche questo secondo libro dedicato alla storia del Kan e alla creazione di uno dei pi\u00f9 vasti imperi creati nella storia. Avvincente, crudo a tratti, ha il pregio di unire ad una scrittura scorrevole, uno sguardo su periodo storico poco conosciuto e su di una figura nota, Gengis Kan, pi\u00f9 per fama che per sapere. Il volo dell'aquila racconta la conquista dell'impero cinese, gli assedi alle citt\u00e0 fortificate e l'espansione dell'impero. I suoi fratelli lo affiancano in questa esaltante sfida: l'impulsivo Khasar, il pi\u00f9 introverso ma assai acuto Kachiun, e Temuge, il minore dei fratelli, addestrato nelle arti sciamaniche e nella conoscenza della scrittura da Kokchu, astuto e ambiguo stregone. Comunque, voi siete miei figli, e mi aspetto che facciate onore al sangue che corre nelle vostre vene. Gli altri guerrieri penseranno alla prossima battaglia, o a quella appena terminata. Voi dovrete pensare alla nazione che un giorno potreste guidare. Spero che troviate degli uomini di cui potrete fidarvi e che creiate con loro un legame forte e profondo. Mi aspetto che pretendiate il massimo da voi stessi. Quando avrete paura, non datelo a vedere. Nessun altro sapr\u00e0 che cosa provate, e qualunque sia stata l\u2019origine della vostra paura passer\u00e0 e la dimenticherete. Il modo in cui vi comporterete, invece, sar\u00e0 ricordato. Il Kan riesce a tenere unite le tribu di nomadi, da sempre isolate e senza casa, verso un obiettivo comune, verso un mondo che sar\u00e0 la loro casa, cos\u00ec vasto da soddisfare la necessit\u00e0 di movimento, cos\u00ec ricco da non renderli agricoltori, cosi unico da non avere pi\u00f9 nemici da combattere. \u00abQuando sarete stanchi, non ditelo, e gli altri penseranno che siete fatti di ferro. Non permettete a nessuno di prendersi gioco di voi, nemmeno per scherzo. Gli uomini lo fanno per vedere chi ha la forza di contrastarli. Mostrate loro che non vi lasciate intimidire, e se sar\u00e0 necessario combattere, ebbene, combattete.\u00bb \u00abE se fosse un ufficiale, a prenderci in giro?\u00bb domand\u00f2 Jochi. Gengis lo guard\u00f2 con durezza. \u00abHo visto uomini cercare di uscire da una situazione del genere con un sorriso, oppure chinando il capo, o magari facendo i buffoni per far ridere gli altri ancora di pi\u00f9, ma se vi comporterete cos\u00ec non otterrete mai il comando. Dovete ubbidire agli ordini che vi verranno dati, ma conservare la dignit\u00e0.\u00bb Riflett\u00e9 un momento, poi riprese: \u00abDa questo momento non siete pi\u00f9 bambini. Nemmeno tu, Ogedai. Se dovete combattere, anche contro un amico, battetelo pi\u00f9 in fretta che potete e una volta per tutte. Uccidetelo, se \u00e8 necessario, oppure risparmiatelo... ma guardatevi sempre da chi \u00e8 in debito con voi, perch\u00e9 cover\u00e0 del risentimento. Chiunque osi alzare il pugno contro di voi deve sapere che rischia la vita, e che perder\u00e0. Se non potete vincere subito, vendicatevi, dovesse essere l\u2019ultima cosa che farete. Viaggerete con uomini che rispettano soltanto chi \u00e8 pi\u00f9 forte e pi\u00f9 duro di loro. Sopra ogni cosa, rispettano il successo. Ricordatelo\u00bb. Ancora \u00abNon permettete mai a voi stessi di diventare molli, o un giorno qualcuno vi porter\u00e0 via tutto. Ascoltate chi ne sa pi\u00f9 di voi ma siate voi ad avere l\u2019ultima parola in ogni conversazione, fintanto che vi chiederanno di esprimere il vostro parere. Guardatevi dai deboli che vengono da voi per via del vostro nome, e scegliete i vostri compagni con la stessa attenzione con cui scegliereste una moglie. Se c\u2019\u00e8 una qualit\u00e0 che mi ha permesso di comandare sul nostro popolo, \u00e8 questa: saper vedere la differenza fra un guerriero spaccone e un uomo come Tsubodai o Jelme o Khasar.\u00bb \u00abUn\u2019ultima cosa. Non sprecate il vostro seme.\u00bb Jochi arross\u00ec, mentre Chagatai spalancava la bocca per lo stupore. Solo Ogedai sembrava confuso. \u00abI ragazzi che giocano ogni notte con le proprie parti intime\u00bb prosegu\u00ec Gengis, \u00abdiventano deboli e ossessionati dai bisogni del corpo. Tenete le mani a posto e considerate il desiderio alla stregua di ogni altra debolezza. L\u2019astinenza vi render\u00e0 forti.

And like it's predecessor, \" \"To drive Your Enemy Before You, and hear the lamentation of the women.\" Poor China - seems they can't get a break these days. Like it's not bad enough with the \"Free Tibet\" crowd and the Olympic Torch fiasco, here we've got Conn Iggulden piling on, sending Genghis Khan and his fearsome horde crashing through the \"Chins\" walled cities and wrecking the kind of havoc made popular in John Kerry's now infamous \"Jenghis\" Khan testimony to Congress in post-Vietnam America. And like it's predecessor, \"Genghis: Birth of an Empire\", \"<+++>Genghis: Lords of the Bow</+++>\", is a raucous, swashbuckling mayhem fest that is at the same time intelligent and illuminating - a rare peak under the covers of a man as ruthless as he was a great - make that extraordinary - field general and tactician. A man who through sheer determination and the magnetism of his personality united tribes of the northern plains that had been warring among themselves for centuries, succeeding in bringing their foes of far superior resources literally to their knees. As with \"Empire\" before it, \"Lords of the Bow\" puts a human face on Genghis - but just barely this time. For unlike the man-child we were introduced to in the first volume, we see the transformation from the child turned out on the steppes to die to a conqueror larger than life, the vanquisher who tramples his enemies not out of cruelty, but simply of cold efficiency. Iggulden resists the temptation of putting a politically correct kind face on the Genghis of nightmares, penning a masterful portrait of a leader with military brilliance of Alexander, forged with the diabolical cleverness of Machiavelli. \"Lord of the Bows\" reads a lot like an Eastern version of the venerable Bernard Cornwell, and in fact, the similarities between the tactics and success of the English long bow and the short, composite bows of Genghis' pony-mounted denizens are uncanny. Battle scenes are gripping and realistic. The author's depiction of the battle of Badger's Pass is a rare literary treat, as fascinating in the strategy and tactics as it is entertaining and suspenseful. But to allay any fears that this is simply a book military maneuvers, take heart: the story is spiced with politics, treachery, deceit, and chicanery - a stunning profile of justice and accountability honed and hardened by Mongolia's unrelenting climate and terrain. Yet more fascinating than the conquests and the carnage is the \"why\" - is rape and pillage really the end, does conquest and submission trump occupation and even unimaginable riches, painting a curious dilemma as Genghis and his tribes leave a broken Chin empire behind and return to their beloved seas of grass and snow? In short, another remarkable and enjoyable effort from Conn Iggulden has me anxiously waiting for the final chapter in the saga of the inimitable Genghis Khan. Well done! ...more Part 2 in the series picks up at the end of his campaign to unite the Mongol tribes with an epic battle with an alliance of Naiman tribes who didn't want to submit to his will. They paid a heavy price. Ghengis picks up a few useful people, like the Shaman Kochku, along the way and assimilates him into his united tribes. We get to see the logistics of the undertaking, and we start to see an insight into his initial inability to understand what a city was or what it was for. For example, there's a Part 2 in the series picks up at the end of his campaign to unite the Mongol tribes with an epic battle with an alliance of Naiman tribes who didn't want to submit to his will. They paid a heavy price. Ghengis picks up a few useful people, like the Shaman Kochku, along the way and assimilates him into his united tribes. We get to see the logistics of the undertaking, and we start to see an insight into his initial inability to understand what a city was or what it was for. For example, there's a tribe to the west that has received an ultimatum to join him or else. They submit to him but it takes them a while to make the journey across the plains because they have been influenced by the Persians to their West and have all but abandoned the nomadic way of life, and built permanent buildings that they decide to dismantle and move with them. Ghengis dismisses a lot of their cultural achievements at first since he doesn't see the value of writing or knowledge about anything other than warfare. Eventually he turns his attention to the Xi Xia kingdom to the south and marches his army across the desert to get at them, only to be stopped by a high wall jammed into a gorge and is initially stumped about how to break through. I could go on summarizing the story from here but I don't want to spoil the book too much for people that don't already know the history of his campaign. The story goes right up to the siege of Nenking (Beijing) and the long period when the Chin inside the city held the Mongols at bay. The more interaction he has with neighbouring people, the more he understands the value of knowledge, and he eventually starts to use engineers to fashion new weapons capable of breaking city walls. Many of his soldiers have to make the transition from warrior archers to operators of machinery. A striking feature of the book is the candid portrayal of the sheer brutality and ruthlessness of this leader. Slaughtering the entire populations of cities as a means of using terror to spread his reputation, mass executions of prisoners who surrendered, using prisoners as arrow-fodder to spearhead his attacks, it doesn't make for easy reading for someone used to living in modern civilised times. But it does make me grateful to have been born in Europe in the late 20th century rather than the plains of ancient Mongolia. ...more", "Title": "Genghis: Lords of the Bow"},
