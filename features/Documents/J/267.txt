I did not like this book at all and yet I am forced to admit it is powerful, important, scary-as-you-know-where and should be read by every parent of teenagers today. My daughter brought Crank home from the school library and also read it in a day; it's positively riveting. Ellen Hopkins first novel is based on her own tragic experience as a mother of a crank (meth) addict. So although Crank is technically a novel it's more correctly a fictionalized autobiography written from the perspective of the young teen, Kristina/Bree. She was born and lived as Kristina for 16 years. After her introduction to crank, or 'the monster' as she refers to it throughout the book, she discovers this wild, seductive, bad girl inside her named Bree. To add to the overall eerie effect, Hopkins writes the entire book in sculpted verse. Each page is a different shape, direction and interplay of italics and plain text. Although I'm familiar with other books which use this poetical technique, I've never seen it used to such creepy perfection. The flow of words, spacing and grouping seem to mimic the rhythm of the drug and how Bree feels it, or the booze, cigarettes, lack of sleep, or whatever event/emotion she is experiencing. Be prepared to stare into the Void. WARNING: The language in this book is as crude as would be expected given the pseudo-life drug addicts slip into. ...more Read a book set in high school.<---F> Ok ya'll</---F>.

Time for another brutally honest and very personal review from yours truly. Gee, i seem to be writing a lot of personal reviews lately, don't I? As some of you may have noticed, I haven't spent a lot of time on here or even been reading much this summer. That's because I've been dealing with a lot of personal shit on my plate. Some of that has to do with work. Some with school. But I am, for the first time admitting to all of you that the main reason is because I've spent the majority of this summer fighting with my personal demons. Of which I have a ton. 99.9% of you guys also don't know me in real life, but if you did, you would know that I am not a person who likes to air my dirty laundry for people. Or share my feelings. Or make my demon battles public knowledge. However, I have come to the conclusion that sometimes I need to resort to unorthodox fighting methods in order to keep the demons at bay. And one of those methods is writing. Because I don't know you guys on a face-to-face level, I really feel as if i can be honest. And myself. And maybe use this space, my own personal cyber-writing pad as a way to get out my inner junk. Because it's there. Clawing at the walls of my psyche for release. And I am writing this review as much for myself AND for all the people who may never read these words just as much as I am writing for you guys who will read them. So bear with me. This may be a bumpy ride. Also, i'm spoiler tagging everything from here on out, simply because there will be some dark stuff in here, so those of you who are uncomfortable with dark and twisty and personal material need not enter at all. (view spoiler) [As you may have guessed by the title, this is a book about Crank. The Monster. Glass. Shards. All known as a little drug called Crystal Meth. A young girl, fighting with her own demons, visits her long lost father one fateful summer and her life collides with the monster. And this is her story. Written in verse. I know there are people who didn't like this book. I understand. There were parts I didn't like. But it hit me so hard and so fast that I had no choice but to five-star this bitch. It has been a long ass time since I read anything that made me cry this much and for this long. But that's for later. 8 years ago I lost the man I was going to marry to Crystal Meth. And I lost our daughter because I was using other drugs to try and deal with the fact that I lost the man I was going to marry to Crystal Meth. I had taken a job in upstate New York for the summer, and he was going to reconnect with his long-lost father in Detroit. Instead of reconnecting with his father, he met a girl. And that girl hooked him on a drug that, until recently, I did not understand. I did not understand its power, its substance. What it makes a person do. How it changes your core until the last shred of the person you were before you met this drug dissolves before your eyes. I did not lose the man I loved in death. I lost him to the monster. There is a man still living who looks a little bit like the man I loved. Still answers to the same name. Receives his mail. Wears his clothes. Lives his life. But this is not him. This is someone else entirely. The man I loved died the minute he met the monster. And the person who rose up to take his place is an impostor. Somebody I don't know. Whom I don't want to know. The monster took a man who knew how to love and taught him to hate. Took a man blessed with kindness and made him mean. Took a man who looked at me with gentleness and love and showed him how to hit and bruise and scar. Turned a man who worked into a man who stole. The monster took away his beautiful brown eyes and left him with those that are tired and bloodshot. It blanketed those eyes with dark circles. Took away his smile, his muscular frame, his strength. It made him someone who doesn't sleep for days on end. Doesn't eat. Doesn't live. It killed his fire and his passion and his will. The monster, in turn, created a monster. But this isn't why I picked this book up. I picked this book up because this summer, the monster tried to select another victim. Another person whom I love and care about. But this time I was stronger. And though my friend's road to recovery will be long and hard, together, we fought the monster and won this particular battle. And though I am beyond thankful and grateful that in this particular case, I did not lose another person to this horrible drug, so many people are not that lucky. This is actually a very unique case and involves a violent battle that doesn't usually get won. This book describes everything from the victim's point of view, so it was very hard to see any other character objectively. However, it gave me a much deeper understanding of things that have happened to me and to two people I love. This is a novel. However, it is a fictionalized version of a true story. Ellen Hopkins's daughter did become addicted to Crystal Meth and all of the raw and biting descriptions of the addiction, the emotions, and the physical manifestations of that addiction are very real. Here is another confession. I am a drug addict myself. Though i have never nor will ever do Crystal Meth, I have fought other addictions for years. I am proud to say that I am clean, and have been for quite some time. My passion has turned to helping people whom the monster (as well as its various partners in crime) has tried to destroy. And I can say with 100% honesty that addiction is a lifelong illness. I still battle the urge to use, particularly when the demons of addiction start partying with the demons of loneliness, depression, anxiety, and life in general. And so this book made me cry. I cried for the lingering pain of a long-lost love. I cried for the agony of a friend. I cried for those I don't know who struggle with the illness. I cried for my own child whom I will never know. I cried for parents who have lost children. Friends who have lost friends. Siblings who have lost siblings. I cried for myself, because I desperately needed to cry. Have you ever had so many thoughts churning inside that you didn't dare let them escape in case they blew wide open? The answer is yes.

I know Crank was supposed to bring to light all the dangers of drugs and how using will destroy your life and blah blah blah. Unfortunately (to me at least) it read like an old \u201cscared straight\u201d type of story (kind of like a Reefer Madness , if you will) . . . I realize I\u2019m an old adult and this book is geared for young adults, so this problem could easily be mine alone, but I just couldn\u2019t ever get on board with feeling any kind of sympathy for Kristina or her family. I know Crank is supposedly based on actual events, but it didn\u2019t read true to me at all. The lack of caring, concern or any type of involvement with Kristina at all by the mother was extremely disturbing to me as a parent. We\u2019re talking about a child \u2013 not some 30-something year old burnout here. Seriously, if your teenager is an average P.I.T.A. hormonal drama mama, but otherwise picture perfect kid who then does a complete 180 and morphs into someone you suspect is on drugs it is YOUR JOB as the parent to try and solve the problem using any means necessary. Hell, it\u2019s your job to stop it before it even starts. If you think you are sending your child to an ex with a major habit, you DON\u2019T SEND YOUR CHILD THERE. Violate your custody agreement, call Family Services and have his dumb ass investigated, do anything it takes to keep your kid away from that person. Writing a book about what happened and cashing in upteen years after the fact is the most \u201cdisturbing\u201d thing about this whole novel.

And while I think it's important that YA authors write about these topics in an honest and eye-opening way, I don't think that Hopkins did that, even though her story is based on first-hand experience with meth.

The form does add some appeal to the novel, though again, I've seen that done before and done much better. Some of these issues, I think, are because of the form's limits (it's hard to develop secondary characters at all when you're writing first person poetry), but others are just limitations of the story itself. I think that there was a lot going on with Kristina that wasn't caused by the drugs -- sure, meth amplified those things, but there were other issues at the root of her bad choices and I thought the author really glossed over them (maybe because she wanted to be able to lay all these problems at the feet of the \"monster\" rather than take some responsibility herself? I'm not sure.) ...more An immensely powerful book, Crank brings us a heartbreaking downfall into drug addiction.

I'm still quite new to verse novels so it did take me a good 100 pages (which took like 20 mins to read, really - you can fly through verse books in no time) to get comfortable with the writing style. Before that I kept concentrating on how I was supposed to read it: vertical first or not? For instance. I soon realized it didn't matter. Plus, by then, I was so into it I wasn't even paying attention to that at all, it had me completely engrossed. Deciding to write such a story in verse was brilliant, however. It turns it into an even more tragic tale, seeing as it leaves no room for sugar coating or frivolous sidetracking. It gives us a blunt, ugly, and completely raw foray into addiction. If you're hesitant to read verse novels, you should force yourself to give one a try. No one is less of a poetry fan as I am - when we studied it briefly in high school, everyone seemed to find such complexity in the meaning of a single verse when I was staring at it wide-eyed thinking for sure they had not read the same thing I just had. With that said, I'm glad that I went outside my comfort zone to try a verse novel. Crank being only my second. They offer something entirely potent from the candid nature of their storytelling. Furthermore, some of the poems in Crank are stylized in such a mesmerizing way, it makes reading it an experience like no other. Crank is not a pretty story; it's very much the opposite. No addiction of any kind is ever pretty. This novel portrays the decent into a drug infested haze in the most realistic of ways. We have a protagonist, here, who becomes captive of what she refers to as the monster. She even develops an alter-ego, kind of as a way to separate herself and stay in denial. We see her delude herself into believing that she is still in control, that she is not imprisoned by her addiction. She will piss you off to no end, yet you will likely still feel sympathy towards her. We see the downward spiral she is running towards, while helpless to stop it. It's heartbreaking, really. She's blind to its impact on her own mind and body, not to mention her family. Addiction affects much more than just the person affected, and this book also portrays how, more often than not, friends and family are just as much in denial as the addict herself. Thinking up excuses for them, not wanting to admit that something is seriously wrong. Poignant and completely unforgettable, Crank is an eye-opening story that anyone touched by addiction should read. It shows us the monstrous, but entirely realistic, road to drug addiction. -- For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads ...more \u201cHave you ever had so much to say that your mouth closed up tight struggling to harness the nuclear force coalescing within your words?

Have you ever been so angry that you couldn\u2019t look in the mirror for fear of finding the face of evil glaring back at you?\u201d ______________________________ Every time I read an Ellen Hopkins book it's always an emotional journey and this one is no exception. This one is probably one of her more dark books, if not the darkest. This book has gritty and gorgeous prose, an addictive plot; it's thrilling and almost frightening to read, and this is a book that challenged how I perceived things. The first book I ever read by her was Burned and it remains to this day my favorite book. 1) The Plot Kristina, our main character, is the definition of someone who would be the perfect daughter. Gifted, excelling in school, popular, held in a high regard. This all changes as soon as she goes to live with her father and she discovers the thing that would always call her back to it: crank (crystal meth). What starts as a fun experiment goes into her own personal hell and the struggle for her mind and her life. Ellen Hopkins's daughter was actually affected by crank. So this book is well backed up with accuracy, and Ellen witnessed the havoc that the monster wreaked on her daughter and everyone around her, and the struggle that came along with her daughter's addiction; this book is mayhem in the best way. 2) The Main Character Kristina/Bree - This girl gets very, very dark when the crank affects her. To the point, that she becomes a completely different person dubbed Bree. It's an amazing experiences reading this book. Ellen Hopkins has an amazing way of making you feel like you're actually living in the book. I would picture Kristina/Bree as Taissa Farmiga. 3) The Writing Ellen Hopkins has an undeniable talent when it comes to writing. She is technically a poet, as all of her books in written in verse. Here are a few examples of the prose that really captured my attention: -\u201cThe monster likes to talk; he jumps into your head and opens your mouth, making it spout your deepest darkest deceptions. Making you say all the things you'd rather not say, at least not in mixed company.\" -\u201cThe problem with resolutions is they're only as solid as the person making them.\u201d -\u201cHow can I explain purposely setting foot on a path so blatantly treacherous? Was the fun in the fall?\u201d -\u201cYou're a gift, one I'll always treasure. You're a dream I never want to wake up from. You open my eyes to things I'll never really see. You're the best thing that will ever happen to me. Be safe. Be smart. Stay you.\u201d -\u201cSo you want to know all about me. Who I am. What chance meeting of brush and canvas painted the face you see? What made me despise the girl in the mirror enough to transform her,turn her to into a stranger, only not. So you want to hear the whole story. Why I swerved off the high road, hard left to nowhere, recklessly indifferent to those coughing my dust, picked up speed no limits,no top end, just a high velocity rush to madness.\u201d -\u201cFireworks. Snowflakes. Sunstroke and frostbite. It was all that I could ask for and completely unexpected. I expected demands. He gifted me with tenderness. I expected ego. He let me experiment. I expected disrespect. He called me beautiful. I expected him to expect perfection. He taught me all I needed to know.\u201d 4) Overall Thoughts As with every book by her, I was profoundly entertained and really enjoyed this book. Ellen Hopkins can't do any wrong in my eyes. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605/5 Stars! ...more www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.com OMG! I am in love with this book. It's so very sad.

Sad for so many out there that face life in the wrong ways, or it faces them in the wrong ways. I was one of them, but in a different way. This is a trilogy and I'm anxious to read the other books and I'm scared at what will happen. I hope something nice. ...more I'm not sure that I can adequately put my feelings about this poignantly written epic poem/novel into words. Part of my fears that I cannot do it justice.

It also proves that not all \"great\" literature looks like a modern novel nor is it written by \"dead white guys\". Written as a series of concrete poems, Crank chronicles Kristina's/Bree's downward spiral and addiction to crystal meth. Told from Kristina's/Bree's perspective, the poem/novel gives readers insight into the monster and its hold over people, especially impressionable teenagers. Based on Ellen Hopkins' real-life battle with her daughter's addiction, Crank gives a voice to the voicelessness of drug addiction. Instead of opting for a trite memoir, Hopkins beautifully embroils readers in her daughter's struggles. The style is like nothing I've ever encountered before; captivating, deeply unsettling, and harrowing, the tale becomes a part of you by the end. I have a feeling this book will \"stick with me\" for a while. In fact, I'll be driving right to Barnes & Noble from work to pick up the two sequels. I plan on devouring them as quickly as I did this one. ...more Kristina is a bright, good kid. But now, Kristina is gone. Bree has taken her place. Bree is dangerous. Bree is willing to try anything.

Hopkins does an excellent job of making Kristina\u2019s transformation into Bree seem realistic, and of making the distinction between Kristina and Bree clear without suggesting mental illness. Bree does not exist because of the crank; Bree causes the crank to happen. Bree exists beneath the surface long before the drugs set her free. The novel is heartbreaking\u2014the reader can see where Kristina is headed, but never stops hoping that something will turn her from her path. The use of verse is particularly effective in this novel. Even the formatting of the poems is significant. I was originally quite skeptical about this format, but I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and felt that the use of this format added an extra dimension to the story. Many teens will identify with the concept of having a secret \u201cother half,\u201d a personality that is quite different from their own\u2014who is fearless and exciting. While Crank is not preachy, it does have a fairly clear anti-drug message that may be more effective than a more heavy-handed approach. My only quibble with the novel is Kristina\u2019s parents\u2019 reaction to her drug use. Her stepfather, Scott, recognized the signs of addiction, but her parents ultimately did nothing save grounding her. It was established that her parents had some knowledge of the drug scene dating back to their youth, but did not use this knowledge to help her. I found that unrealistic. ...more Interested in more of my reviews? Visit my blog ! Crank, you see isn\u2019t any ordinary monster.

My Thoughts This is my third foray into the works of Ellen Hopkins and I have yet to be disappointed. These are hard books and I can see why people either love them or hate them. They wrestle the difficult subjects that normal authors refuse to touch in order to avoid controversy or dispute. I can understand this; however, that makes me love this author that much more because she does wrestle these tough subjects. She tackles them to the ground and does it with gusto. All of Ellen Hopkins books tell a brutally honest tale and you\u2019re not likely to get a happy ending either so don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re left beaten and bruised by her stories and not given your fairy tale ending. Her books just simply are take it or leave it.

I say it is a level Z reading book. It was written in a poetic way, like no other book. The characters in the book are Kristina Georgia(a.k.a Bree), her mom, Adam, Chase, and Brendan.

Until one day that she went on a trip to visit her dad. That experiance changed her for life. She met the monster: CRANK. Crank is a type of drug. She started to do it because of the guy she met Adam. Adam was her boyfriend while she was visiting her Father. After she meets the monster she becomes the girl that was \"sleeping\" in her. She becomes Bree. Her mom is the type of mom who cares for her kids but, doesn't show it until something bad happens. Chase was her boyfriend after she came back from her trip. He also gave Crank to Kristina. He is a smart guy and eventually becomes the husband of Kristina. Brendan was the first guy Kristina went out with after she came home after her trip. She only went out with him because he was the only one who she knew that had Crank.Brendan took advantage of that and raped Kristina. He is the original father of Kristina's baby. The characters made a huge impact on Kristina. The book was mainly about how Krisitna was affected by the Crank. In the book Kristina had nothing wrong with her. In the end she had a lot of problems.Through out the book Krisitna kept being less and less of herself with the Crank she took. In the begining Krisitina didn't want to do Crank or any type of drug. But she did it for her boyfriend. In the end it was like she had to take the drug. But she stopped doing it so her baby could out alright instead of mutated by the drug. Her mom did not pay much attention to her until she started noticieng something wrong with her. Kristina did not tell anyone that she was taking the drug. When her parents did find out she was doing drugs they did nothing except watch her more carefully. When they found out that she was pregnant they went crazy. They did what they could do to help her. Chase ended up in USC. He was going to marry her. Her baby boy was born with no mutation. The baby boy got lucky. Kristina tried quiting the drug but, did not completely stop. She took a few more sniffs. But anything can happen to her in her life. She is only still 17. ...more I picked this book out of my advisory grab bag and it's thickness made me a little nervous about having to tackle such a large book in a week in a half.

Well I really wouldn't call them \"poems\" more like paragraphs with weird spacing, but those weird spaces created lots of blank space and a lot less words. Other than the shortening factor of the poetic layout, I really would have preferred a normal book. It was really annoying when the poems is written all on the left side of the page except the final word. It made my head hurt. And even worse were the poems written so that it had seemingly random spaces and no order once so ever. I understand there must be a reason behind this but is this really necessary? No. It's not. No one wants to take the time to figure out how the heck to read this, but you're forcing them to. Yea yea \"it symbolizes the disorganization of her life after doing meth blahblahblah\" yea well I'm NOT doing meth and annoyingly spacing the words out is not going to entertain me, it's just not. On to the plot! Well I don't really think I am the preferred audience, teenage girl in New York, okay yea maybe I am. But it didn't surprise me all to much. Anyone who has seen a drug rehab lifetime movie presents could have guessed the story. Oh no! She'll do drugs! Oh no! But wait! Someone gets raped! Oh no! She'll have sex! And guess what else? YES! She's preggers! Oh my goodness! and if THAT wasn't enough drama for ya! THE RAPIST IS THE FATHER! I'm sure there are A LOT of people who will eat this secret life of teenagers drama right up like an apple pie. But I'm not one of those people. If you liked \"Go Ask Alice\" this is the book for you. If you didn't like it or even just didn't bother to read it, like yours truly, this is not the book for you. I guess it was just bad luck at a grab bag. ...more More reviews @ Anti-Drug Reads I don't know why, but I wanted so much to hate this book...

I'd never read a novel done entirely in free verse before, so I was interested to see how it would turn out. After reading it, I have to say that it's the content of a slight novella stretched across 500+ pages. Theres an astonishing amount of white space and many pages contain no more than nine or ten words. But that's not the crux of my criticism of the book. But rather it's the nature of the stylistic choice to write in verse rather than simple straightforward paragraphs. The bedrock of which is simply that 'verse' implies 'poetry', and 'poetry' in turn promises robust and compact description (the better to navigate the tight strictures of poetic spaces) and inventive and surprising use of language. Sadly, the 'verse' here has little of that. So, I'm left to wonder why the author chose to write this way. It cannot be for story-telling reasons, as the breezy and staccato nature of the stanzas often forces the author to gloss over detail that is vital to the narrative. For instance, at one point the author writes: \"Somehow, Lucinda and I found an odd rapport.\" This is simply statement, not concrete description. How was the rapport odd? What conversations led to this turn of events? What did it sound like? What did Lucinda look like? Sadly, we never find out. This paucity of concrete detail riddles the novel and drains the narrative of tension. We are left instead with lists and pseudo-poetical rhetoric. One could argue that the visual arrangement of the text adds to the novel's depth. And true, the verse is very creatively and painstakingly arranged. Some of it is shaped into wedges, sweeping slopes, slanting V's, or even just plain peppered haphazardly across the page. And I'll admit, some of it is pretty cool. But my alarm bells go off when I feel an author has to resort to textual mimetics in order to give me narrative cues. It indicates weak writing and flaccid plotting. Which brings me to the major weakness of the novel. I can forgive all of the above if the story is compelling. But Hopkins instead falls back on too many predictable cliches and relies on melodrama and shock to compensate for under-characterization and lack of detail. A lot of bad things happen to the protagonist, but my emotional response is blunted by my lack of understanding of her motivations. The character, I guess, is supposed to be troubled and vulnerable and apparently carrying loads of Mommy issues. But the nature of these troubles is never brought to the fore, so the character comes across looking merely stupid, vapid, and appallingly selfish. One could say that that aptly describes the average teenager. But I tend to think they are a little more complex than that. This was a fast read, so I might be willing to give another a try and see if they get any better. Or perhaps try another author who writes in this manner and see if the same faults manifest themselves. If not, then in the future, if I want to read books written in verse, I'll stick with Shakespeare or Milton. ...more Life was good before I met the monster.

Kristina faded into the background when she met the monster. Adam introduced her to crank. Bree gets addicted. She wanted it more and more until she couldn\u2019t stop. She is now dependent to the monster. Kristina loses control over herself to Bree. This is a seriously sad story. Kristina had a good life. Not perfect but good. I couldn\u2019t get why she gave into drugs. Sure she met a good looking guy who does it but does she have to do it to. She had the opportunity to refuse but she didn\u2019t. Things spiraled out of control and she became addicted. What I also don\u2019t get is why there was nothing done about her situation. That is just crappy! Sure her mother loves her (I think) but she should have done something. They should have done something. This book didn\u2019t really end in a good way but since there is a sequel I can\u2019t really be sure how Kristina\u2019s story ends. What I loved about Crank is that it deals with teens getting into drug abuse. Ms. Hopkins made this book to open up our eyes to the reality of what teens could or is going through with drug abuse. The author used an indirect approach in making the readers realize how dangerous drug abuse is. I felt my heart crushing every time Kristina/Bree made the wrong decision. Every wrong move that she did made me want to hold her tight and not let go until she stopped. It breaks my heart reading this. Sometime my stomach couldn\u2019t take it anymore. It just wasn\u2019t right. But I know that it is happening to people. That was what makes me feel worse. The fact that there are a lot of people with the same problem but they weren\u2019t getting the support that they need to overcome the addiction. This is not the end of Kristina\u2019s story. The sequel is called Glass. Haven\u2019t read it yet but hopefully she would get better. Keeping my fingers crossed. This book somehow reminded me of A Million Little Pieces by James Frey. Both books were based on a true account. But with James\u2019 story he eventually gets better. Hopefully, Kristina/Bree does too. I give this book 4 stars! ...more This book was... WOW.

I typically read Go Ask Alice with my 11th/12th graders because of the detailed description of the main character's drug use and ultimate downward spiral. I think it is an important book to share because of the impressionable and exploratory stage my students are at. After reading Crank, I would not be opposed to reading it with my class instead of Go Ask Alice (maybe switch between the two). There are several reasons why I might do this, one being that Go Ask Alice seems dated to many of my students now. There are references and certain language used in the book that my students didn't understand. Another reason is the unique format in which Crank is written. Go Ask Alice is written in a pretty simple diary format, whereas Crank is written more like poems. I feel like my students would benefit from reading a novel in this type of format because it can be easily connected to: other poems about drug abuse, ELA poetry terms, songs about drug abuse, etc. Lastly, of recent, meth seems to have grown in popularity. It would be beneficial for my students to see how all consuming and life changing meth addiction can be. In saying all of this, I am not trying to downplay Go Ask Alice, and will still be using it in my classroom. It is a superbly realistic and terrifying book in its own right. But, if you need to work in some 'poetry' in your classroom, or need to switch up your books, then I recommend giving Crank a try. *If I do use this in my classroom I would be sending a letter home to parents beforehand.

Ellen Hopkins is one of those authors whose books you can only read so many of at a time before they all start blending together into one loosely incoherent story, because they all sort of deal with the same topics (they're all about drugs and sex and naughty stuff teens shouldn't be doing). That mistake was one I did the first go-round Hopkins-style, and one I'm not going to make again. This go-round, I'm only reading the books in this trilogy, which are CRANK, GLASS, and FALLOUT. I'm not going to re-read IMPULSE, IDENTICAL, BURNED (although I'm so tempted because that's my favorite of them all), or TRICKS. I'm just going to read these three and be done. So, if you want these stories to be somewhat memorable for yourself, I recommend savoring them slowly and getting a good feel for what they have to offer individually, not reading them all and making the mistake I did, not being able to remember anything but the book's topic. CRANK should've been a five-star read. It could've been a five-star read. It wasn't a five-star read, but merely a three-star read, because something about it was missing. Hmm . . . I dunno. Maybe that missing thing was an INTERESTING, VARIED PLOT! Here. Let me give you the run-down on CRANK's plot. [image error] Except maybe more like \"Get High, Sleep, Feel Anxious to Get High Again, Repeat!\" The effort put into trying to keep the plot varied and interesting was a fail that turned out to be something like this: In words, it goes like this: Kristina moves. Kristina gets high with her dad. Kristina moves back to Reno. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. (view spoiler) [ Kristina gets raped. (hide spoiler) ] Something different! *gasp* Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Kristina gets high. Put that on repeat about 50x, and you'll be good. A GIANT, CORROSIVE FAIL. One thing I love about Hopkins' writing, though, is how inventive and beautiful some of the poetry-style entries are. They're not all about Kristina/Bree. No. Some of them are about just \"the monster\" (meth) in general, and they describe what it feels like to be on it, something you won't get in that enormous detail anywhere else. And, I know, it is written in verse, so it's expected to be beautiful. And it was. The negative side to Hopkins' style of writing in verse is that because the formatting has to be a specific way, the length of the sentences can be greatly reduced, sometimes down to even a single word per sentence, which may go on for a whole page without leave. This makes for what seems like an easy read (even though, in all reality, it wasn't that easy), and it can be misleading. CRANK was a very inventive and very true account about what drugs can do to a person's otherwise perfect life. It doesn't seem preachy, but at the same time, it sounds informative and gripping.

I just do; you can drug test me right now and I'll probably pass, but I love drug books.) Then I saw it was all poetry'd-out, and I put it back down. Then I picked it right back up and gave the first page a try, then I checked it out of the library and speed-read it all in a day. I said \"speed-read\" on purpose. Crank , as you may have guessed, is about a young protagonista (that's a term I just invented for girl protagonist; betcha it doesn't stick) who gets hooked on meth. And actually, Crank had me from Page Zero, an author's note in which Hopkins reveals that the book is based, at least in part, on her own daughter, who tried and got hooked on meth young. And who ended up pregnant months later. Knowing these details from the get-go lends a fairly outrageous story some welcome plausibility even before it begins. The protagonista is Kristina, who lives with her mom, younger siblings and a pretty awesome stepdad. She leads a virginal, wholesome existence until she visits her dad for three weeks. Dad hasn't been around for a decade, and he hasn't grown up any in the meantime. Keeps the refrigerator bare in a crappy apartment. Works in a bowling alley. Spends the rest of his waking hours smoking, drinking and - when he can - snorting meth. Dad changes none of his routine when Kristina comes to visit, but the true seductive influence is a kid named Adam who lives in the apartment complex. Adam is so gorgeous to Kristina that she doesn't care about his girlfriend, and she doesn't care that his hobby is sniffing powder. So it's not long at all until she's sucking those first couple lines up her nose at the bowling alley. And when her dad finds out, he joins in. Fuuuuuck. First comes the meth, then come the alcohol and cigarettes, in an oddly backward gateway-drug scenario. There's such a marked lack of hesitation or reservation on Kristina's part that it's almost like she's become a different person before she tries meth. In fact, she introduces herself to Adam as \"Bree,\" an alter-ego she creates on the spot. Bree is the anti-Kristina, never self-conscious and not worrying about anything but getting down with \"the monster,\" the term she immediately coins for meth.* This all happens so quick in the narrative that, as a reader, I didn't want to believe it. But I flashed back to being 18 and drunk in a room of people who were mostly strangers. I'd spent my teen years feeling inferior and uncomfortable, and now I was buzzing and feeling free, feeling at home, feeling the warmth of a room filled with laughter that I was almost singlehandedly creating. Drunk me was the real me, I thought - I didn't casually drink that night with plans to become an alcoholic, but I wasn't making the plans. My monster was. Addiction can be a lifelong cycle of gaining control, holding onto control and losing control. When Kristina gets on that plane home after three weeks and has to face her stable nuclear family, the party is just beginning, and so is the nightmare.

I've scanned through some reviews and found some Crank -haters, and I can understand their arguments, but to me resistance was futile. Perfect book? No. Downright fascinating? Wholly absorbing? Yes, and yes. And it's got two sequels. - * = Thanks to this, I've had the Eminem/Rihanna song \"The Monster\" stuck in my head for most of the week. - RANDOM NOTE: Maybe it's coincidence, but lately when browsing the YA section at the library, I've noticed praise blurbs from \"Ellen Hopkins, author of Crank \" all over the front and back covers of probably eight different books. It seems like a disproportionate number, like Hopkins is a quote whore, like she's the \"Jeff Craig, Sixty Second Previews \" of the YA world. Anyone else notice this? ...more", "Title": "Crank"},
