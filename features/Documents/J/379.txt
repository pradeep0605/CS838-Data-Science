Si mal no RESE\u00d1A CON SPOILERS Y MUCHO SARCASMO Qu\u00e9 decepci\u00f3n. La trilog\u00eda de Michelle Hodkin sol\u00eda ser una de mis preferidas, pero desde que rele\u00ed los dos primeros libros, empec\u00e9 a notar actitudes desagradables en los personajes principales, y mi amor por la trilog\u00eda disminuy\u00f3 bastante. Quiz\u00e1 se deba a que estoy creciendo, y ya los libros young adult no significan tanto para m\u00ed. El punto es que estaba ansiosa por leer la conclusi\u00f3n de esta trilog\u00eda, por la cual Michelle nos hizo esperar tanto. Si mal no recuerdo, <+++>The Retribution of Mara Dyer</+++> iba originalmente a publicarse el mismo d\u00eda que Allegiant de Veronica Roth. Lo s\u00e9 porque lo ten\u00eda anotado en mi calendario. Pero le\u00ed en un blog que la fecha de publicaci\u00f3n iba a ser cambiada, debido a que la autora no hab\u00eda quedajo conforme con el final que le hab\u00eda dado a Mara Dyer. Traducci\u00f3n: Michelle hab\u00eda asesinado a uno de los personajes principales, y por eso decidi\u00f3 cambiar el libro. Esperaba algo mejor que esto. Puntos negativos: a) Mara y sus dos amigos tuvieron todo en bandeja de plata. Ellos lograron escapar ilesos del lugar donde la se\u00f1ora Kells los ten\u00eda secuestrados. Lo peor es que fue todo tan f\u00e1cil. O sea, hab\u00edan solo dos, DOS, individuos custodi\u00e1ndolos en todo el edificio: Kells y Wayne. Yo esperaba que por ser un edificio de dif\u00edcil acceso, ubicado en una isla remota , la seguridad fuese de alto nivel. La autora les puso retos muy simples a los personajes. No sent\u00ed su lucha por escapar. Todo fue piece of cake. b) El poder de persuasi\u00f3n de Jamie fue tan conveniente. Lo \u00fanico que le faltaba era tener un rastreador para encontrar a Noah. Mara y sus dos amigos escaparon de la isla gracias a un par de pescadores que les llevaron al muelle; luego inventaron que el resto de sus compa\u00f1eros les hab\u00edan gastado una broma cruel al dejarlos abandonados en la isla, sin comida o medio de comunicaci\u00f3n. Pero es que hay buena en el mundo capaz de proveer a tres adolescentes sospechosos con comida, dinero e incluso ropa... \u00a1gratis! Sin pedir identificaci\u00f3n alguna o llamar a sus representantes. Como dir\u00eda mi mam\u00e1, as\u00ed la vida es un jam\u00f3n Yo tambi\u00e9n quiero encontrar a buenos samaritanos que me regalen cosas. *Hace puchero* c) El que le hayan dado mucho protagonismo al hermano de Mara me pareci\u00f3 algo sin sentido e innecesario, que solo sirvi\u00f3 para chantajear a la pobre Mara. Pienso que a Michelle no le qued\u00f3 de otra que utilizar a Daniel para ese prop\u00f3sito. Y no funcion\u00f3 conmigo. c) Noah asesina a Mara. Noah asesina a Mara Noah asesina a Mara Noah asesina a Mara NOAH ASESINA A MARA Para m\u00ed esa escena acab\u00f3 con la pizca de no-odio que le ten\u00eda a Noah. Pens\u00e9, cre\u00ed, ten\u00eda la ilusi\u00f3n de que \u00e9l har\u00eda algo bueno por primera vez en su vida y se matar\u00eda en lugar de hacerle da\u00f1o al amor de su vida. Pero oh s\u00ed que estaba equivocada con Noah Shaw. \u00c9l inyecta a Mara con una sustancia que su padre le hab\u00eda dado para asesinarla. Pero por alguna raz\u00f3n que a\u00fan desconozco, Mara sobrevive a esa inyecci\u00f3n letal, y despierta para ver a su pobre Noah con un cuchillo en el pecho, cortes\u00eda de su ex novio Jude. Qu\u00e9 escena tan emocional. c) Despu\u00e9s de que la haya asesinado, Mara perdona a Noah (porque el amor lo puede todo, por supuesto), y luego llegan las escenas de amor entre MADNESS. Hasta el nombre de la otp es tonto. Si hay algo que me molesta m\u00e1s que el villano revelando todos sus planes antes de asesinar a su \u00faltima v\u00edctima, es el que terminen la pel\u00edcula con besos y sentimentalismo barato. \u201cJe t'aime. Aujourd'hui. Ce soir. Demain. Pour toujours. Si je vivais mille ans, je t'appartiendrais pour tous. Si je vivais mille vies, je te ferais mienne dans chacune d'elles.\u201d Por supuesto que nuestro querido Noah Shaw no dejar\u00eda pasar una oportunidad de iluminarnos con su incre\u00edble conocimiento de otras lenguas. \u201cYou are what happiness means to me. And I would rather have today with you than forever with anyone else.\u201d \u201cI know what I can do to a girl with a word, a look, a touch. And I want to do them all to her.\u201d Y aqu\u00ed lo que menos me gust\u00f3 de todo el libro: El mensaje. d) La relaci\u00f3n entre Mara y Noah es destructiva. Ellos lo saben. Se les ha dicho a ambos que si Noah sigue con Mara, \u00e9l morir\u00e1, ser\u00e1 destruido . \u00bfY qu\u00e9 hacen ellos? Siguen juntos. No creo que el mensaje que se les est\u00e9 dando a los j\u00f3venes lectores sean el correcto. S\u00ed, el amor es bonito y toda esa cursiler\u00eda, pero si est\u00e1s en una relaci\u00f3n que sabes terminar\u00e1 de mala manera, lo correcto es dejar a esa persona, por mucho que la quieras. Puntos positivos: a) Lo \u00fanico que rescato de este libro es Jamie. \u00c9l es la raz\u00f3n de esa estrella. Jamie fue quien me hizo seguir con la lectura cuando lo que quer\u00eda hacer era abandonar. \u201cBefore I could say anything, Jamie began writing giant letters over the words with his index finger. F-U-C-K Y-O-U. My sentiments exactly.\u201d \u201cI planted a kamikaze kiss on Jamie\u2019s cheek. \u201cFUCK,\u201d he shouted, wiping it off. \u201cWhat if you killed me!\u201d He threw a Skittle at my face. It hit my forehead. \u201cOw!\u201d \u201c Taste the rainbow bitch. \u201d Hubieron pocos momentos que realmente disfrut\u00e9, y todos ellos fueron cortes\u00eda de Jamie. La mayor parte del libro se va en la operaci\u00f3n Finding Noah , y muchos aspectos me resultaron bastante predecibles y sin sentido. Creo que el final de la historia de Mara debi\u00f3 haber sido mucho mejor, porque esper\u00e9 mucho para este libro, y termin\u00e9 decepcionada. Sin duda uno de los peores finales que he le\u00eddo. ...more Thirst not completely quenched, hunger not fully satisfied, questions not fully answered and yet I\u2019m still one happy gal and one of the things about the entire series that made me happy is how I could never point out what it really is.

She has become a total wacko, the things she did a lot gorier yet funnier and commendable. (Yes, I am sometimes or a lot of times perverse. Forgive me). It also made me happy that I could not seem to predict which direction the plot is going to take and which course of action will specific characters choose. It was really cool.^^ One thing is consistent about the series though, Mara Dyer is awesome and so are the other characters in the series who are all are adorable, unique and funny in their own ways.

Sadly, it ended the way most YA PNR usually does with nonsensical non-answers and a speshul snowflake heroine who thinks she's a badarse but is actually just a boy-obsessed-twit who gets her sappy-speshul-snowflake ending. Ugh. -The plot didn't consist of much, most of it was repetitive. The first 75% or so was just Mara/Jamie/Stella going from A to B to C to D whilst occasionally bumping into trouble of some sort. There wasn't enough focus on Horizons/the experiments/the powers, there was too much of Mara angsting, and worrying and searching for her precious Noah. -I mostly hated Mara, she could have been awesome but her obsession with Noah was nauseating, it took over her whole personality. She wasn't even bothered about finding out who she was and why her and her friends has been followed, locked up and experimented on. Nope, it was all about Noah. Pathetic. There were things I did love about Mara: Like her repeatedly using proper swear words when the situation called for it unlike most do goody heroines. Also, her murdering/hurting people was great, it was even better when she felt very little guilt/remorse for punishing people. It made a nice change from the usual overly forgiving, always guilty heroine. -I was glad Noah wasn't in it much, I would have preferred if he wasn't in it all though. He was such a generic hero. He had no personality apart from his mummy/daddy issues and his manslut ways. -I don't know why there was the whole 'Is Noah Dead?' cliffhanger at the end of the book 2. It was obvious he would be alive. I don't know what the point of cliffhangers like that are. It's such a cheap trope. It would have been more original and satisfying if he had actually been dead or at least evil instead of the usual cliches. -Was I meant to find Noah/Mara choosing to be with each other at the end romantic? Was I meant to be rooting for them or something? They were so selfish getting together when Noah could have changed the world (though I don't get how). Also, I hated how Noah's suicidal tendencies were romanticised, like all that was needed was the power of Mara's love to save and cure him. The guy needed professional help, he didn't need a destructive relationship. I would have enjoyed the ending more if Noah/Mara parted ways after they sexed it up, now that would have been romantic and epic - them giving up their love and not being able to be together for the sake of everyone else. It was such a great opportunity to make Noah/Mara tragic heroes instead of the insufferable twits they were. -I liked most of the secondary characters, especially Jamie and Daniel, their interactions with Mara was great. Stella and Mara's friendship was the most enjoyable though, probably because it was the only significant relationship Mara had with another female character. I was unimpressed that Mara was only really close to/interacted with guys. -I rolled my eyes at Mara's pregnancy scare, the whole thing was done purely for some cheap drama midway through. It was obvious Mara wouldn't be pregnant because YA heroines have to remain virgins/baby free because they are only allowed to shag it up/be impregnated by the manslut heroes. It would have actually been interesting if Mara had to deal with an unwanted baby that was forced on her by crazy scientists. But no, we were stuck with the same old, formulaic YA romance/dynamics. -The reasons for Mara and co having powers was down to them being born with a special gene. So the powers were all genetic based, yet the rules about the carries of the gene were utterly nonsensical. Apparently, if a carrier of one of the superpower genes wasn't killed by its foil (a person with the opposite sort of gene) then the anomaly would manifest again later on in their bloodline. What? How would that even work?! If a dominant gene is passed on then it'll manifest full stop. How would Mara's grandma dying affect Mara's genes? It was like saying someone who had a cancer gene would never get cancer because their grandma who had the original gene got cancer and died and that would magically make their own genes dormant. That's not how science works! Ugh, it made no sense. -This was such an unsatisfying ending. There were so many things left up in the air, and the few answers that were given were unclear. What was Mara's real name? Why did she even change her name to Mara in the first place? It wasn't like she was a criminal or in danger. Or was the Mara Dyer trilogy actually supposed to be the books she was writing at the end or something. If so, what a fucking cop out. What was with Mara's reflection when she was drugged up? The drugs were meant to block her powers completely but instead she got a convenient new sort of power which just so happened to tell her exactly what had been going on when she'd been out of it. How perfectly contrived. What was the point of all those grandmother flashbacks? They didn't add much to the overall story. All they did was show Mara's grandma having the same sort of powers as Mara. Why was Mara able to heal herself when she was dying? Why would her fully manifesting into her powers save her? Healing wasn't even one of her powers. Also, how did she even get powers in the first place? Didn't her grandma cancel them out by dying or something? Wasn't that the whole reason why she was hanging around with Noah's mum so that Noah could kill her and stop the curse/gene from carrying onto Mara or her siblings? If Noah's dad didn't want Mara anywhere near Noah why did he manipulate things so they'd end up near together? If he thought she was so dangerous why did he and Kells trigger her powers and push her so much that she went crazy and murdered people? Where did Noah's dad disappear to after Mara was dying? Why didn't he come back for Noah and take control of him now that he was free of Mara? How did Noah survive the knife wound at the end? If it was his healing powers then why did he think stabbing himself in the heart would work in the first place? Both Noah and Mara coming back from the dead was ridiculous, one of them should have died. Why was Jude bothered about his watch in the recording? What were with those drugs in Mara's stomach? If they were able to stop her from using her murderous powers then why did Kells want to kill her if the drugs were working? She was no longer dangerous. Why did Lukumi impregnate Mara's grandma? Did he want another person with shadow powers or something? How did Lukumi/Lenaurd not recognise Mara when he first saw her? Wasn't he following her family? What was Lukumi trying to even achieve? Was he trying to help Mara or did he just want Noah? What was his end goal? How could he be centuries old when his powers were having visions and not healing? Why was Noah such a big deal? Surely, there were other healer/hero types that had been born? How exactly could Noah's powers change the world? Why was Mara's grandma slow to age as well? Why did Noah's dad think Mara would be such a menace to the world? Her grandmother had the same sort of powers and she managed to not go on random killing sprees. The only time Mara killed (when she was finally aware of her powers) was in self defence. There was no real reason for Noah's dad to want her dead. Him fearing she would make Noah weak was ridiculous, they were both teenagers - so why would he think they'd spend the rest of their lives together? Nothing made sense. -The writing was pretty good, it was easy to read and the various descriptions were done well. Well, except for the cringey sex scene at the end. -Didn't like the pop culture references, it took me right out of the story. I wasn't expecting great things from the Mara Dyer finale, but I was expecting a decent resolution to the mystery. Instead I was just left more confused by the piss poor explanations. I wanted less Mara/Noah angst and better world building and answers. I would only recommend the trilogy to anyone who wants a series that at its heart is just a cliched PNR YA love story. ...more Hands down, best book/series finale I have ever read. Fucked up. Insane.

I hate her guts. -On the board that Mara read in the hospital at the end, it said that Claire also had the weird supernatural traits. Wait, but then how did she die? I'm confused -You know when the fortune teller lady said she got bribed with the tall dark handsome guy with an accent at the carnival? I wonder if he's the same guy Mara saw at the well with the old lady in the flashback. -NOOOOOAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. He's obviously not dead, guys. Michelle Hodkin would have to face the wrath of us fans. We'd collapse her house- on accident of course.... >:-D I'm thinking very violently. This is my first review on this site.

Those instincts were dead, and I was calm as my wet fingers slid up the tiled wall, groping for a light switch. I found one without even having to stand. Four lights slammed on above me, one after the other, illuminating the dead body on the floor just a few feet away. My mind processed the facts first. Male. Heavy. He was lying face down in a wide, red puddle that spread out from beneath him. The tips of his curly black hair were wet with it. There was something in his hand. The fluorescent lights in the white room flickered and buzzed and hummed. I moved to get a better view of the body. His eyes were closed. He could have been asleep, really, if it weren\u2019t for the blood. There was so much of it. And by one of his hands it was smeared into a weird pattern. No. Not a pattern. Words. PLAY ME. My gaze flicked to his hand. His fist was curled around a small tape recorder. I moved his fingers\u2014still warm\u2014and pressed play. A male voice started to speak. \"Do I have your attention?\" the voice said. I knew that voice. But I couldn\u2019t believe I was hearing it.\u201d Holy. Shit. I need this book!! Whose voice is it!? Jude?... Noah!?!? PLEASE BE NOAH! Edit 08/7/13: Hold on.... JUNE 2014!!?? Are you kidding me!? I Thought I was gonna have this book in my hands in two months and now you're telling me that I have to wait another year? Not cool. Edit oct 2012 : Can I haz it? Can I haz it now pleaseeeee? The waiting is gonna kill me! After that hell of a cliffhanger It will be impossible to live with all of these questions that I have in my mind and know that I won't get any answer until next year! I need more Noah! Have you guys seen this cover? I hope this is the final cover! 'Cause is really pretty, I love it. ...more Actual Rating: 4.5 \"Thinking something does not make it true.

I must confess that I was scared with the ending arriving. I actually thought that there was a fourth book that I didn't know about when my pages were finishing with a lot of story to tell. But I was rewarded with big decisions and even thought I ended with a lot of questions, it wasn't bad. Michelle Hodkin got a new fan and this series will have a special place in my shelf and in my mind. Because seriously, it was genius. I had so many theories about what was real or even if the whole thing really happened or if she was just in the hospital dreaming... In the last book of this series the plot gets darker and creepier. Sometimes when I needed to stop (Really needed for really good reasons or else I just wouldn't sleep) I couldn't stop thinking about it. Plus, all the insanity helped compose such a great environment for all the action and mystery. \u201cWhat\u2019s the most terrifying thing you can think of in these tunnels? Rats? Mole people?\u201d \u201cEvil mastermind hell bent on killing you?\u201d Jamie suggested. \u201cWrong. The most terrifying thing in these tunnels is me.\u201d Losing a person can make another insane. As Mara wasn't that mentally healthy to begin with, she really lost it. So now we have crazy people with superpowers and great irresponsibilities. Mara gets really badass and has no sense to get what she needs and protect who she loves. \u201cYou\u2019re not so bad, are you?\u201d Those were his last words before I cut his throat. So you know when you like a story so much that you get really involved with it all? In the end we can't notice our own scruples to see what is right and what is wrong and we are just rooting for a character. Yes, this happened here. There must be a villain for every hero, a demon for every angel, a monster for every god. Despite what we are, I do not believe this. I have seen the villainous act heroic, and men called heroes act villainous. The ability to heal does not make one good any more than the ability to kill makes one evil. Kill the right people, and you become a hero. Heal the wrong ones, and you become a villain. It is our choices that define us, not our abilities. Hodkin's writing was so engaging that she was able to through how hypocrite society can be judging in a way that is so entertaining that we don't see that we are judging ourselves. At the same time it was full of seriousness, revelations, murders and freaks. It was still able to get a light vibe with some good funny, cute and lovely moments. I looked behind me and scanned the room for a camera. Stella followed my gaze, then stopped and pointed at a tiny little reflective globe suspended from the ceiling, in the far right corner of the room. I stared at it for a moment, then raised my hand and gave it the finger. \u201cI thought you were going to give it the District Twelve salute,\u201d \u201cWhat are you going to do to them?\u201d \u201cI kind of want to see Mara Crucio their asses\u201d \u201cAvada kedavra, more like\u201d They suspected our differences and hated us for it. So we had to pretend to be what we were not, so we would not be harmed for what we were. I don't think I can talk more without giving spoilers. To summarize, this is a story full of lies, deaths, love and hatred, trust and betrayal, guilt and intrigues and insane mutant x-men teens who were tortured and experimented upon in prol of science. A great journey about gods and monsters, blessed and cursed, a dragon and a hero. This is a love story. Twisted and messy. Flawed and screwed up. But it\u2019s ours. It\u2019s us. I don\u2019t know how our story will end, but I know how it will start. ...more \"The villain is the hero of her own story.'

But the story of Mara Dyer grabs you completely and you come to understand that there is much more in this world we call \"normal\"that we can not see, you forget it and you completely get into the stories where everything is beyond FANTASTIC !. Ok let's start with this book in which I found it of the best I have read is that this series does not stop to put on better and better. The Retribution of Mara Dyer Undoubtedly one of the strongest early ... This time we find a different Mara and you soon realize that she is changed , shows a much darker and calculator image. I come to think that in fact if it was something crazy, kept me chills!. \u201cThe villain is the hero of her own story.\u201d (view spoiler) [The things she saw people in the mirrors and talk with itself can not be normal lol (hide spoiler) ] I love her so much that has not changed I have fond a lot with Mara for all the things she had to spend through I think it's fair and understandable that beech changed his personality and is darker and fighter, which undoubtedly also due to power and things that have been revealed in the previous book In fact according to myself mara has been protagonist in one of the strongest scenes of the book I have shocking (view spoiler) [ as it was attempted rape by Ernst. I went crazy with that scene My God. Mara really went for it. A shock scene with the scene of the self-stabbing (hide spoiler) ] ... speechless about that. Noah had me with my heart in my throat for nerves throughout the book and if you read it you know why! (view spoiler) [I think was really dead :( And then it was, then wasn't OMG I can't with myself on that scene (hide spoiler) ] \u201cDo not find peace. Find passion.\u201d Flashbacks have been great the story was taking shape thanks to them! . At begining is a little confusing but then you're tying nails and is much easier to understand. And then there is the character of the father of Noah that in fact think it was time for his grand entrance, a character hidden so long, a very cold person. (view spoiler) [I liked its appearance but I think it was perhaps predictable that has something to do is that it was always named as the worst man in the world and never appeared ... it was suspicious to me (hide spoiler) ] . And that END !! for the love of God \u201cThis is a love story. Twisted and messy. Flawed and screwed up. But it's ours. It's us. I don't know how our story will end. but I know it will start. I pick up my pen and begin to write: My name is not Mara Dyer, but my lawyer told me I had to choose something.\u201d Really do not want it to end I think they could easily make 4 more books is a story without waste, but I'm already dreaming lol. The thing is that it was a beautiful end of truth is already I was waiting something catastrophic and I was crying profusely but ... if yes I was crying but it was for happiness.... is a story that has everything but in terms of impossible love and mystery takes gold [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more OH MY GOD.

I love this series and the release date keeps getting pushed further and further away! Dear author, please just release the darn book! I'm begging you! SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!

I love this series and the release date keeps getting pushed further and further away! Dear author, please just release the darn book! I'm begging you! SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!! So I've bee stalking Michelle Hodkin on every social website available to me and this is what I found. I haven't read the teaser by the way :))) Copied from Michelle Hodkin's Tumblr: http://michellehodkin.tumblr.com/ Death, kids, and books. My mother says that only two things in life are permanent: death and children. You can\u2019t undo either of them. You can\u2019t ever take back having a child, and you can\u2019t ever bring someone back to life. This has always been a comforting idea for me. Think about it: pretty much any mistakes you make in life you can unmake! You can move on from a failing grade, or a failing relationship. You\u2019re never stuck, or trapped, no matter how stuck or trapped you might feel. You can always start fresh. Start over. Reboot. But in the last few years, I\u2019ve realized that there\u2019s a third thing that you can\u2019t ever undo. Most people won\u2019t have the chance to discover this third thing, but I have. You can\u2019t undo a book. Once it\u2019s published, and people read it, it\u2019s out there. Forever. You can\u2019t ever unwrite it, or go back and change it. It may go out of print someday, or fade out of public consciousness if you were ever lucky enough to have your book become part of the public consciousness in the first place, but its still something that can be found and will exist forever in whatever form you wrote it in. Whatever mistakes you\u2019ve made in it are permanent, on the page and in people\u2019s minds. When I\u2019m having a hard time making a choice, which is a lot because I\u2019m a naturally cautious and indecisive person, I try to do that which I will regret the least. And in working on the third book in the Mara Dyer trilogy for the past 16 months, I came to realize that I would regret asking Simon & Schuster to push back the book less than I would regret having them publish the wrong book. And they have been nothing but patient and understanding about it. Sometimes you have a moment of clarity when you realize the book you\u2019re writing is not the book you should be writing, that it\u2019s a good story, maybe, but it isn\u2019t the story you need to tell. You\u2019d think that it can\u2019t happen with the third book in a trilogy, but it can. It did. It happened to me, and I know I\u2019m not the only one. I\u2019ve finished The Retribution of Mara Dyer three times now. The first first draft of it, semi-complete at 87,000 words, was just blowing out the cobwebs, as they say. I scrapped almost all of it. Then I started on a new draft, which was actually pretty good. Really good, in parts. But as I wrote, the deeper in I got the more I realized that while it was starting to take shape as an awesome story, it wasn\u2019t the story I needed to be writing. It wasn\u2019t the end of Mara\u2019s story\u2014it was the beginning of something else, something different. So I put it aside completely for now, and started over again on the book I needed to be writing, and I\u2019ve been working on it since. I can\u2019t tell you much about it, but I can tell you this: I love it. I think it\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve ever written, and I think you will too. It\u2019s shocking and provocative and wild and a bunch of other adjectives I won\u2019t use because spoilers, but the important thing is: I\u2019m proud of it. And a thing I want you to know: the ending to the trilogy has always, always been the same, since the second I had the idea for the series. Only the beginning and the middle have changed. (So, you know, nothing important). So that is all to say, The Retribution of Mara Dyer will not be coming out this October. It will be coming out in 2014. When specifically, I do not know. When I do, I will tell you personally, and I will make sure that the date I give you is the official date. I am so, so sorry to disappoint you\u2014you can\u2019t possibly know how sorry I am\u2014but not as sorry as I would be if I gave you the wrong story. The Retribution of Mara Dyer is finally right now, and the ending of the trilogy, which you will read in 2014, will be the right ending. And I can\u2019t be sorry for that. But to soften the blow, how about a teaser? [Here be spoilers, under the cut] \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 The first thing I noticed when I woke up was that I was covered in blood. The second thing I noticed was that this didn\u2019t bother me the way it should have. I didn\u2019t feel the urge to scream or speak, to beg for help, or even to wonder where I was. Those instincts were dead, and I was calm as my wet fingers slid up the tiled wall, groping for a light switch. I found one without even having to stand. Four lights slammed on above me, one after the other, illuminating the dead body on the floor just a few feet away. My mind processed the facts first. Male. Heavy. He was lying face down in a wide, red puddle that spread out from beneath him. The tips of his curly black hair were wet with it. There was something in his hand.

He could have been asleep, really, if it weren\u2019t for the blood. There was so much of it. And by one of his hands it was smeared into a weird pattern. No. Not a pattern. Words. PLAY ME. My gaze flicked to his hand. His fist was curled around a small tape recorder. I moved his fingers\u2014still warm\u2014and pressed play. A male voice started to speak. \"Do I have your attention?\" the voice said. I knew that voice. But I couldn\u2019t believe I was hearing it. ...more I'm not sure why so many people were so disappointed with this conclusion. I actually thought it was quite good! While it was a bit slower than the first two books, I still found it to have that creepy vibe and the story all came together for me in the end. My main issue with this book was that there were too many of the \"before\" parts and I wasn't a fan of that story line. Overall this is a great series! I listened to it via Audible and I thought it made great audiobooks! WAIT UNTIL... WAIT A MINUTE \u00bfNOVEMBER 2014 ?
