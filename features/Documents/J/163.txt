Patience Webb is a Hollywood actress in 1928 who doesn't agree with the direction her career is going. She escapes Hollywood and her agent and decides to start a whole new life devoid of agents, bosses, and men. Eddie is a 23-year old man who inherits a house in 2009. Rumor has it that his house is haunted and the 1920's music blaring from his basement seems to agree with this theory. When he investigates the music, he discovers a door in his basement that leads directly to an amusement park in 1928. He also discovers a world where history tells of the death of Patience Webb in 1928. This turns out to be a problem being that Eddie has grown a little fond of her. It keeps you hanging on to the very intense end. ...more I liked the idea behind this book but it just became too preachy for me. Do people actually throw Bible verses into conversation to prove their point? Nope. Not unless they're a preacher or something similar! Also, real people don't just sit down with strangers at breakfast and say (<---B>paraphrasing here</---B>), \"I have to hate people because they all disappoint me eventually.\" The dialogue was also unbelievable and stilted. Stopped at 43%\u2026 This was a great shorter time traveling romance.<---F> No swearing and no sexual content</---F>. Christian viewpoint. A secret door that leads to the 1920's. I can recommend for ages 16 and up due to some adult content. I give it four stars. I really liked it. Time travel, romance and explosions. It passed the time nicely. This was a light,<---M> quick read</---M>, almost a thriller but more of a cozy.<---A>Scott McElhaney</---A><---C>Scott McElhaney</---C><+++>Saving Brooksie</+++>", "Title": "Saving Brooksie"},
