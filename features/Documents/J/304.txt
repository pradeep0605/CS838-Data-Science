The book is divided into four main sections [Visitation, Guest, Host, and Crossing]... Within each of these sections we are taken inside the mind of the main and supporting characters. We've lots of diversity in the streets of London. The speech sounds vary....the dialect and language feel authentic. In this local London neighborhood people are a wide mix of twenty and thirty year old's -- young adults coming of age..... immigrants from all over the world.

Mind you I left certain excerpts of the novel on their voicemails. Zadie has an uncanny ability to channel the souls and essence of character and through thoughts, snippets, fragments, poetry, atmosphere, dialogue and situation paint wonderfully vivid living portraits of individuals knowing each and every motivation and nuance of feeling. I often felt that I was interacting with these characters and knew them intimately in a three dimensional way. This was strange to me as I had absolutely little in common with any of them but I grew to care about them so much. Zadie has the wonderful magic to translate the profane into the sacred and vice versa like a high priestess of an ancient cult. Zadie is much more than a novelist here. She is a -developmental psychologist -urban anthropologist -wordsmith extraordinaire -local historian -cultural interpreter -spiritual advisor and -profound poet Do I have a crush on Zadie?

All these themes are reflected in the The cover-flap copy makes this seem like a playfully pomo tragicomic treatise on contemporary city life but it seemed more like a simultaneously straightforward and purposefully skewed narrative exploration of superaccessible topics like long-term friendship, fluid identity (possibility of), order/chaos (extremes to which we might alternately lean when there's lack or excess of either), ye olde search for meaning in a world that rarely stays ordered forever. All these themes are reflected in the structure: the stories of two long-time female friends (Leah and Keisha/Natalie) interrupted by the tangentially related story of a familiar neighborhood face (Felix), streaked with the story of someone tangential from the girls' past (Nathan Bogle) who affects Felix's present. These stories are for the most part presented in chapters/sections ordered with traditionally ascending numbers, except that (in Leah's section) when presented with a sufficient stressor, the chapter numbers jump from 14 to 37 , a number of irrational/mystical significance involving numerological quasi-faith/sense of order in an otherwise disordered world (see p 37, UK edition). Keisha/Natalie's section of the book is the most traditional, an episodic series of 185 numbered short bits (missing #37, of course) relating fleeting coming-of-age memories/nostalgia (great bit about first listening to a Walkman, suggestions of TV shows from Friends to The Wire), sexual experience with objects and others, first loves, education, ascendancy by virtue of working twice as hard as whites not from the council estates. This section, despite the appearance of numbers, reads traditionally/linearly, often with scenes and dialogue, but it's an unfulfilling order for Keisha (renamed Natalie to reflect her new professional identity), who longs for disorder (p 267, UK): \"There is a connection between boredom and the desire for chaos. Despite many disguises and bluffs perhaps she had never stopped wanting chaos.\" A thematic key for readers confused by this novel appears early on (Page 10, UK): \"Leah spins her spoon in her tea . . . She pressed the bag too hard. The leaves break their borders and swarm.\" Such swarms (chaos) abound after the borders of various tea bags (ideas of order) are broken. Clearly, Leah's metaphorical tea bag is broken when Shar enters her apartment in the first scene, but she can deal with it until, in chapter 14, again, she breaks down after calling Shar a thief and receiving a volley of patois in return on p 36, a scene followed by chapter 37. Keisha at first longs to escape the order of the family unit and then later as Natalie with her own family plus nanny etc she again longs to leave it -- she wants to tear open her tea bag and let the leaves swarm. Other ideas of order are expressed as The Law (see Kafka's \"The Trial\"; also, \"At RSN Associates the law burst from broken box files . . .\" p 215 UK), ye olde Anglo-Saxon London, bellies kicked and sliced or swollen with baby, the encapsulated past (Garvey House photo book) and the uncollected present, and again -- on an all-important formal level -- conventional versus unconventional structure. Other dualistic dealios exist, especially one related to boredom opposed to ecstasy/catharis/the fullness of time (google link to Kierkegaard quote presented on p 223), the difference between a moment and an instant that Natalie thinks of as \"blossom.\" And this sort of thing relates to the difference between a page of Mapquest-style directions from point A to B (p 33) and a page of sensations and specifics along the route (p 34). Some folks mention that they don't quite like the characters, and I think this has to do with structure and characterization. Early on I had trouble with characterization -- at first it felt detrimentally underdone, but by the end I realized that this was consequence of the structure (for example, Natalie and her kids are presented early on but we don't know much about them -- they're more or less disembodied proper nouns at first) but major players come to life once things focus on Keisha/Natalie Blake, the latest in the line of slant semi-autobiographical characters (see Irie in \"White Teeth\" and Zora in \"On Beauty\"). Minor players (Jayden, Nathan Bogle, Marcia, Tom, Annie) maybe remain a little underdrawn, and therefore seem like thematic representatives more than characters (Jayden reps open-living freedom; Nathan Bogle reps the encapsulated past torn open)? Natalie's husband Frank is somehow almost a sort of superhandsome successful Trinidadian Italian hybrid stereotype (if such a man can possibly be a stereotype), but he's the only one who's characterized with real vibrant zeal, like the author was concerned that James Wood might protest (oh lord, there she goes again with that Hysterical Realism!) if she didn't tone shit down a bit in this one? In general, names at first seem unremarkable (Tom, Frank, Leah, Natalie, Michel, Ned) but fill out with compelling prosaics in time, almost as a lesson to the reader in the importance of considering the complexity of consciousness and experience inherent in commonplace names and faces. I realize I haven't gone into the section with Felix and Annie so much. Felix tries to set things in order and do what's right -- and he gets swarmed for it. Maybe I'll revisit this part a little later on. In general, I feel like I need to re-read the first two sections to really see how the parts relate, but that's also the point of this book, to create initial readerly disorientation/sense of disorder that solidifies/focuses/blossoms as the characters' lives become more disordered (ie, as their tea leaves swarm)? That tension, that movement -- readers acheiving order as characters lose it -- is maybe one of the book's pleasures? Again, it's the sort of book that probably requires a second read, a book whose first read for me I felt merited a second read because I'm sure it's chockful of rewarding links between parts and people, associative goodies throughout I couldn't easily make on first read, that importantly relate to overarching themes of order and disorder/connection and disconnection. It might call for a second read but not the way Joyce or Faulkner usually do -- it's comparatively easy reading on a line to line level throughout. Overall, an engagingly slant story -- in terms of thematic and narrative procession, it's necessarily more angular (NW) than straightup (N-S-E-W). Some stray sentences of significance: \"Captive animals, contemplating a return to nature. Natalie is calm, having already traveled to the other side.\" (p 77) This line makes sense when you reach the end! \"Some days have a depressing thematic coherence\" (p 115) The sort of line that you think might be self-referential when you're not sure if the book's hanging together thematically at that point. \"There is an image system at work in the world. We wait for an experience large or brutal enough to disturb it or break it down completely, but this moment never quite arrives. Maybe it comes at the very end, when everything breaks down and no more images are possible. In Africa, presumably, the images that give shape and meaning to a life, and into whose dimensions a person pours themselves . . . are drawn from the natural world and the collective imagination of the people . . . In that circumstance there would probably be something beautiful in the alignment between the one and the many. . . Pregnancy brought only more broken images from the great mass of cultural detritus she took in every day on a number of different devices, some hand-held, some not. To behave in accordance with these devices bored her.\" (p 237) No annotation necessary -- relates to the fullness of time, being in synch with society, being one with being etc, \"each in its ordered place\" per Faulkner. \"Here nothing less than a break -- a sudden and total rupture -- would do.\" (p 282) ...more This is the novel I hoped Zadie would write.

There are some tragic scenes, some interesting ones, some thought-provoking. What I liked about the book is how Smith portrays the new England, the new London in particular. This is a London which is very culturally diverse, where Churches, mosques, synagogues are in close proximity; where you can easily find African markets and so on. There is no longer a homogeneous image of what it means to be English/a Londoner. Smith incorporates the linguistics of London into her book. I think it may be hard for people who aren\u2019t familiar with British slang to understand parts of the dialogue, I don\u2019t know. It made me curious about whether the book would do slightly better in the UK than it would do in North America and elsewhere. I\u2019m not sure if the fragmentary structure of this book really worked in Smith's favour, although I found myself warming up to it as the book went on. Still, I think the stream of consciousness style that was present in much of the book was a bit much. It\u2019s a grim book; drugs, alcohol, poverty, council housing. Everything seems so stagnant. I much preferred White Teeth. ...more ...NW came to an end and I sat back in my seat and closed my eyes.

Ah, yes, perhaps it hadn\u2019t been a movie after all but a documentary; just a camera following a few inhabitants of north London as they went about their daily lives, travelling on the tube, sitting in their back yards, going to the supermarket or the church or the pound shop, the camera picking up odd snatches of dialogue, a few words here, a few words there, yes, a documentary about the enclosed world of NW, rarely moving beyond it, although I remembered a couple of shots of Chancery and, was it, Regent Street, the camera jumping about a bit as they do in documentaries sometimes, very realistic but a little disconcerting for the viewer. And what had been the point of this documentary? I was still confused. I opened my eyes and looked around me. The vivid red and blue dust jacket of the book which lay beside me caught my eye. NW.

I\u2019d never thought of this before but it\u2019s so true. Cussing as a tribute to Shakespeare! In fact Smith is consistently brilliant at contemporary social observation, at drawing attention to new and revealing speech patterns and behavioural quirks.

She also comments on how television depicts poverty \u201cas a personality trait.\u201d In essence, NW follows the paths of two young women from the same council estate \u2013 half-Irish Leah and Caribbean Keisha (who re-invents herself as Natalie), both of whom, unbeknowingly to themselves, are stalked by two males from the same estate, less successful at reinventing themselves - Nathan, something of a cultural clich\u00e9 with his regime of hustling, drugs and crime, and Felix, a reformed rogue and addict who teeters on the brink of a new beginning. All four will eventually be united by a shared experience. Leah, Keisha, Felix and Nathan are perhaps better as vehicles of cultural descriptive prowess on Smith\u2019s part than characters we truly care about. Without wanting to give away the plot, the undoing of Keisha\u2019s reinvention of herself wasn\u2019t entirely convincing psychologically and seemed more like a plot device than an inevitable signature of character. Often this novel seems more like a documentary than a novel, an insightful piece of social history. Smith does a brilliant job of capturing the nuances of street life in the decade she describes. A brilliant job at creating a visual map and soundtrack of the small piece of London she\u2019s describing. The relationships in the novel were perhaps less rich and engaging, though she did a good job of depicting the close friendship between two females with observations like this: \u201cShe was in breach of that feminine law that states that no weakness may be shown by a woman to another woman without a sacrifice of equal value being made in return.\u201d ...more I'm nobody!

Then there's a pair of us \u2014 don't tell! They'd banish us, you know. How dreary to be somebody! How public, like a frog To tell your name the livelong day To an admiring bog! Zadie Smith's NW has been compared to lots of different works: Mrs. Dalloway, Ulysses, Telegraph Ave, even White Teeth, her debut novel. It seems to me that nothing comes closer to its essence than these few lines by Emily Dickinson. Set in NW London, also the setting for White Teeth, it is primarily about two life-long friends-the nobody's from the poem-as they try to figure out who they are, to themselves, to their families and to each other. Natalie, aka Keisha, is a barrister and mother. From a Jamaican family, she's worked hard for her many achievements but has lost something vital along the way. Leah, of Irish descent, is less focused than her friend and has achieved less. She may embody her ambivalence in a less-nuanced way, but she is no less troubled by her present life and the uncertainties about her future. Telling their stories allows Smith to ruminate about some troubling social trends in the city of London. The chasm between the haves and have-nots, the negative consequences of gentrification, immigrant alienation, substance abuse and racism are combined with some trenchant observations about zealous religiosity, sibling rivalry and mother-daughter antagonism: this bog-a neighborhood she calls NW-has it all. Smith skewers many modern absurdities in a rambling, sometimes ungrammatical, prose style which might be off-putting to some readers, but seemed perfectly suitable to me for this tale of alienation and renewal. Although the section about Leah is divided into regular chapters, they are comprised of descriptions that blend with dialogue into a dreamy stream-of-consciousness with a hip-hop rhythm. Natalie's segment is divided into mostly short, numbered segments reminiscent of a self-help manual. It is an effective way to illustrate Natalie's rigor and self-control as Smith artfully peels away her carefully constructed facade to reveal a disturbing inner life. Two minor male characters provide a stark contrast to the comparative well-being of the women. One of them strives for renewal while the other one, a once-promising athlete, is defeated by his lack of discipline. Smith wants her characters-and her readers-to appreciate how neighborhoods can shape us in ways that can be positive, negative or both. She presents this particular neighborhood, with its complexities and contradictions, as a microcosm of the greater world and she does it with wit, style, and a clarity of vision. This may lack the manic exuberance of White Teeth , but it is no less powerful in its impact. ...more \"Sneaky animals. Foxes are everywhere.

I'm enjoying most of them quite a bit, and as most of them are still from the BEA and ALA ARC's (why don't I see if I can figure a way to throw a few more three letter abbreviations into this sentence), I'm fairly optimistic for this fall's new releases even if I'm not at all optimistic about the company I work for not figuratively fucking itself up the ass with a twelve gauge shotgun and then pulling the trigger thinking that it's probably a good idea (that strained imagery brought this song to mind: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTkHl9... , which probably has no place in this review, but when is it not appropriate to share some questionably racist and homophobic early 90's gangsta rap?). I haven't read Zadie Smith's last novel, On Beauty , I really mean to, but I feel like I should (re?)read Howards End first, and every time I decide, ok, now I'm going to read On Beauty I'm just not in the mood to try to find my copy of Howards End to read for maybe the first time or maybe the second (how pathetic that I can't remember if I read this book or not, I think I have but I don't remember a thing about it. If you read a book and about eight years later you can't remember a thing about it did you ever actually read it? Is that time just lost, what good is reading if you're swiss cheese mind can't hold anything in it?). I'm only mentioning this because that is supposed to be an amazing novel, and I feel like I should know how I feel about it to compare NW to it and see if she has developed as a writer, or if this is a step backwards for her? I want to be able to answer that question. From the Zadie Smith books I have read, this is much much much better than her disappointing sophomore Mr. Autograph , and about on level with her quite good debut novel White Teeth . Thematically it's in the same ballpark as White Teeth , sweeping-ish portraits of Londoners with quite a few issues of race and class being looked at. What I'm not sure though is if she has taken a step back from On Beauty and retreated to possibly safer ground in this book. While reading the book I found out that she is going to be reading at my store sometime in September. This will give me a third opportunity to be in her general vicinity and feel really awkward and want to say something like, I really like your books and instead say nothing because I'll feel super intimidated because she's really smart and really pretty and because I have the social skills of a socially retarded rock, so instead of meeting her (which could be easily arranged, I could just ask an events coordinator if I could be introduced, it's really simple to do), I'll instead ask the same parenthetical events coordinator if she can get a signed copy of this book for me, and maybe it will even be personalized to me, but it will probably be a third occasion I could theoretically talked to her and didn't (the first two? An event for Autograph Man at the store years ago, and last month at BEA she was just hanging out around the Penguin booth for awhile). The book takes place in Northwest London, which I think is a part of London that is predominantly lower-class. I know nothing about the neighborhoods of London though, and if I had any sense of the geography of London I think I would have gotten a bit more from the book. Neighborhoods are mentioned that I know from songs of bands like Pulp, but I really have no idea what those places are supposed to be like. From Pulp lyrics I would guess sort of hip, but from here I'd imagine sort of run down and not so nice, sort of like the uncolonized neighborhoods of Brooklyn (which will soon be hip and the whole borough will be one giant sprawl of places too cool for the likes of normal folks). Four different characters are followed who all grew up in these neighborhoods. Each character gets his or her own section of the book, and my one gripe with the book is that there are some weird typographical choices made to differentiate the sections from one another, and I'm not exactly sure if I approve of some of the choices made in the first section, although I'm going to suspend judgement until the final copy of the book is in my hands because maybe this is just an awkwardness in the reader copy and not how the final product will look. If this is in fact the way the final book will be typeset then, well, some interesting choices were made that look sort of interesting, but more just add some unnecessary confusion to the text when pagination happens to fall in certain ways. I'm sort of wishing I didn't hand off the copy of this to Karen already so I could give an example, but it basically comes down to a sort of weird way dialogue is formatted and has a tendency to bleed into the non-dialogue parts of the text at times. I also wish I had the book so I could give character names, my stupid brain has already forgotten them. Stupid. (I was thinking fuck, I'm never going to write this review, so I might as well just pass the book along already, and now here I am about six hours after handing the book off writing the review). The book's third section is probably the strongest. It follows a bookish girl of Caribbean descent from her childhood, through her church-going nerdish adolescence to her transformation to a successful lawyer with a new less ethnic (or whiter?) name. That section is up there with some of the stronger parts of the surprisingly great Jennifer Egan novel A Visit from the Goon Squad (I totally blanked on the name of this novel while writing it, and for a moment I was convinced that the name of the novel was \"In on the Kill Taker\", but that is the name of a Fugazi album, and I knew that, but I was still just going to put it there and not look up what the real name was, and just see if anyone actually made it this far into this fairly uninformative review to call me out on my blatant mistake, but then I googled to remind myself (ok, to tell me) what the name of the book really was.) I would love if the whole novel had been as strong as this section, but the other three just aren't. Looking back at the novel as a whole I want to say something like, why couldn't she just develop the third section a bit more and make it the whole novel, or why can't the other sections be beefed up and made as great as that one, but I'm thinking that their relative weakness to the juggernaut third section work as a nice bit of complements to that story. Shit, I've written quite a bit and I've said very little. I'm happy I just sat down and wrote anything though, so I'm going to post this. If you are a fan of Zadie Smith you'll probably read this no matter what I say anyway when the book comes out in a month. If you haven't read her yet I'd recommend eventually reading this, but give White Teeth a shot first, I think it might actually be a stronger novel than this one, but there are definitely things about NW that are quite good and she has side-stepped some of the more sensational elements of her debut novel. ...more A slow burn. I took a while to get into it, since NW is self-consciously experimental. Fifty pages in, and I remember why I love Zadie Smith.

He's from Brazil, Sikh by choice, disclaims his birthright, vegan. We were smoking and listening to Russian rap online via Radio 3 Switzerland until 4am\"). That's her big theme: interesting Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims and Africans living together in the dirty part of London in a country formerly only of boring white people. And the local colour is always more interesting for all their hard luck. Whatever. She always hooks me with incidental details. Half-faded decals of cartoon characters in a children's hospital. Her characters' use of smartphones and how the phones complicate social interactions, i.e. people using phones when they are with their friends, signalling they are bored, lonely, distracted. The mould that grows on the ceilings of unventilated apartments of people from hot countries who crank the heat in mid-winter. Seeing the wave of your friends have children, who then email you photo attachments of exhausted mother and child, in which the mothers look more sweaty, dishevelled, and alien to you than you've ever seen before. People's rooms being an expression of their inner states of mind. I love her for these details alone, because I've been in these rooms and situations too many times. But she also fleshes out 4 fully realized people: Irish social worker, young black mechanic, professional black lady barrister, and a homeless guy (I've definitely met the lawyer). These characters, their lovers, parents, and dependants roam through Smith's old council estate, Willesden, and around to other similar neghbourhoods, causing drama, suffering, and struggling with the actual problems and non-problems of their late 20s and 30s. Smith is still crap at endings. Her endings are abrupt, and always leave me flipping casually back through the book to see if the build-up warranted that kind of trailing off. I finally re-read the end, the beginning, shrug, and go on with my life. For her, it's the details and characters that matter. Smith is maturing. NW is my favourite so far. ...more Umphh..

The author spent so much time working on the box and the wrapping, that she forgot she actually had a flipping novel to write! A story that is worth telling! Content, juice, meat, anyfing.... there's just none of that here, innit? Now, I do have a certain admiration for the structural acrobatics that Zadie Smith used in NW. It reminded me of some musicians who at a certain point go \"balls out\" and dare to try a completely different thing, with the hope that they will either be recognized as geniuses, because they actually invented something new, or at least they will inspire some change. A daring feat, experimental, almost like watching a new circus number. All this formal sophistication might very well distract readers, like a magic trick, from the fact that this is a very cold and very dark book. What matters to me, especially with fiction books, is that pulsating core that exists at the center of each novel. In NW, we are given dark charachters with despair in their hearts, cold people with cold personalities and thoughts. And how accurately Smith portrays the absolute faithless, godless approach to life of Londoners. All this, with no plot whatsoever. Like a graphic novel that consists only of disjointed black and white sketches of miserable people. To use some teen language: I know, right? Ugh! No wonder many reviewers on this site were left almost doubting their own intellectual skills. I read a few \"I don't know if I'm not sophisticated enough to understand this novel, but...\", and \"I'm not sure what I just read\". You see what you did, Zadie? Not only, as I mentioned above, there is no plot at all, but also what IS actually there, in between the ink somersaults, I found boring and unpleasant. I thought Jonathan Franzen was the undisputed master at generating the most annoying fictional charachters, but no, Zadie Smith was able to defeat him. The incomplete, envious and frustrated Leah. The cold, arrogant, cheating Natalie. Personal taste, maybe, but I wouldn't like to spend 30 seconds with any of these two. And what happens to Shar, the girl who shows up at the beginning, promising intriguing developments? Like many other elements in this novel, she is lingering at the sides of the destroyed railway that is this story, with nothing to do, no traction to provide. Finally, I found myself agreeing wholeheartedly with this bit from a review on \"The Guardian\": \"The whole of the first section is defined by its resistance to genre, by what it doesn't want to be. It's like an oddly shaped inner-city park, bounded not only by chick-lit and thriller but by the modernism it aspires to. The touches of dilute Joycean play are less like new ways of looking at the world than mildly adventurous ways of organising a narrative. [ ] The whole book is oddly queasy about the value of getting on in the world.\" ... and with the article's conclusion: \"The real mistery of NW is that it falls so far short of being a successful novel, though it contains the makings of three or four\". my wonderful blog is here ...more I am sure that there are those that will disagree with my 2 star rating.

To begin with we read about Lea Four characters who all grow up on the same estate in the London borough of Willesden and who, as adults, are all ultimately linked by one event that takes place there. Leah and Natalie are best friends with that inevitable period of falling out for a couple of years. They are of the same generation as my own daughter so at times I felt like I was given an insight into aspects of her secret life, one or two a little worrying! This friendship was movingly detailed. To begin with we read about Leah as a married adult, her equilibrium unsettled by a demanding stranger arriving at her door, a ghost from the toxic estate on which she grew up. Leah\u2019s story will then continue through the Natalie narrative which is composed of chronologically paced snapshots. We are taken back to their childhood and teenage years. Natalie is the most socially successful of the characters, a barrister, married to a beautiful man and mother of two children. She too though will be revisited by her background. Natalie is perhaps the most puzzling character and maybe the least successful, odd because she shares more attributes with Zadie Smith herself than any of the others. The two males, Felix and Nathan get shorter thrift. Both are black and both fall prey to the most negative social stereotyping of young black men. \u201cEveryone loves up a bredrin when he\u2019s ten. With his lickle ball \u2018ead. All cute and lively. Everyone loves a bredrin when he\u2019s ten. After that he\u2019s a problem. Can\u2019t stay ten always.\u201d Felix is on the road to redemption; Nathan is falling deeper into a life of crime. Essentially this is a brilliant character study of an urban environment at a specific time in history. Almost like a documentary chronicling the cultural props and changes of a decade on London\u2019s streets. Smith\u2019s eye for telling detail is particularly impressive. ...more I find it odd that anyone can read this book without feeling extraordinarily pleased that someone somewhere is taking the effort to think about this fucked up world in a manner that is both dispassionate and instructive.

So but anyways, a shame I left her NW so long on the shelf. I found myself quite happy with it, even if it wasn't on the level of WT. But then immediately I began upon her On Beauty and am not so pleased ; and not because the characters, &c, but because so far it is just so plain , as in literary=fiction =genre plain. Hoping still for some fireworks and fewer s/he saids+adverb. And then too I'm holding out for a 1000=page brick from Her Greatness. ...more Author Smith says NW is about language, and I agree. Language is central to our understanding of the characters, and language defines their lives in many ways. I had the good fortune to listen to the audio of this title, brilliantly read by Karen Bryson and Don Gilet. Having access to a paper copy at the same time, I feel confident that the spoken version is an aid to clarity and understanding, and there was true enjoyment in hearing the range of vocal virtuosity by both readers. I did end up Author Smith says NW is about language, and I agree. Language is central to our understanding of the characters, and language defines their lives in many ways. I had the good fortune to listen to the audio of this title, brilliantly read by Karen Bryson and Don Gilet. Having access to a paper copy at the same time, I feel confident that the spoken version is an aid to clarity and understanding, and there was true enjoyment in hearing the range of vocal virtuosity by both readers. I did end up listening to it twice. A clear example of how language can define one is the incident of a boneheaded young man with the posh accent, Tom, selling an old MG to the young man Felix, who had made great strides towards self-realization despite the tug of his background and the brake of his language. Any observer of that scene would immediately suspect Felix of putting the fix on when objectively that would be far from the case. And Keisha, or Natalie as she began calling herself, managed to change most things about her world when she changed her language. She became a barrister and even forgot what it was like to be poor. But this novel is also about the process of becoming. To my way of thinking, there are only two central characters in the novel, Leah and Natalie. Both resist adulthood, but the choice is not really theirs to make. They become adults despite their attempts to hold back the process, and end up making decisions that demonstrate authorial control over their own lives, stopping their ears to very loud protestations from their inner selves. Therefore they land in adulthood awkwardly, splay-legged and wrong-footed, and must find a way to right themselves again before acknowledging they are older, wiser, and already there. Several other minor characters, e.g., Annie and Nathan, manage to avoid true adulthood altogether by burying their options beneath addictions. Felix was the one that was most consciously \u201cbecoming.\u201d He strove daily to be a better man--for his woman, for himself, for his future family. He made himself happy doing it. He got clean, \u201cwas conscious,\u201d and made himself and his family proud. But demons chased him down. Maybe you can\u2019t really ever get free. In the last third of the book, a 50-something female barrister \u201crole model\u201d dressed in a gold satin shirt beneath the expected blazer, and a diamante trim to de rigueur black court shoes tells Natalie: '\u201cTurn yourself down. One notch. Two. Because this is not neutral.\u201d She passed a hand over her neat frame from her head to her lap, like a scanner. \u201cThis is never neutral.\u201d' Of course I\u2019d heard of Zadie Smith, but I\u2019d never read her early work. She was so popular when she first came into print that I decided to wait to form my own opinion when the clamour died down. Sometimes it is so noisy out there when a new, talented author is heralded that I can\u2019t hear myself think. I never had the feeling while reading this novel that Smith was haphazard in her choice of images or language. The novel is constructed and in the end one looks up to see graffiti covering a wall with violent scribbles of bright color.

You can read her review here. 3.5 stars The book is divided into sections narrated by different characters. Our first storyteller is Leah, a young white woman from North West London with Irish parents, married to a black African francophone immigrant, Michel. The initial encounter Leah has with a young woman begging for help at her door reveals her generous nature, while the fragmentary style of the writing seems designed to show us the style of her thought. We learn that Leah is resisting uncomfortable pressure on her from all sides to get pregnant. We realise that she and Michel have got married hastily, each naive about the other's life plans. While Michel has unexamined patriarchal attitudes playing out in his relationship to Leah, claiming her property, being & body as his own, she has been attracted by his beauty and kindness, and for her the relationship is based on lust. I was struck by the way Leah's encounter with the desperate woman was reconstructed by Michel and her mother, and how this changed her behaviour. This kind of skilfully handled detail built up an impression of Leah as very passive and easily swayed, like my younger self. I found Leah and her mother Pauline very realistic as white people who have generationally graduated levels of ignorance about race. While Pauline is ridiculous and ignorant in her attitudes, Leah is embarrassed by her mother's racism, but she is no more able to see whiteness; Smith shows this very skilfully though Leah's resentful and self-pitying feelings about her relationships with her co-workers, particularly her black boss. By presenting this from Leah's viewpoint without author-voice judgement or caricature, Smith helps me to see the same attitudes in myself forgivingly but critically. Leah narrates encounters with her black friend Natalie and her husband and children. Leah sees her as grown up and her life as meaningful - this is partly conferred by motherhood - only giving birth legitimises a woman's existence, according to the overt & implicit messages Leah constantly receives from husband, mother, friends. Natalie remains mysterious; Leah does not seem to understand anyone very well and especially lacks self awareness. There is a wonderful middle section of the book narrated by Felix, a character whose story intersects only briefly with the core narrative around Natalie and Leah. I think Smith has written this section because it's important to her that this character be a site of empathy in the book, rather than a stereotyped stock figure. She breathes life into everyone as far as possible; I feel she takes pains to stop us from making assumptions, while at the same time drawing on familiarity to create recognition and identification. She uses dialogue to this end, very acutely observed as critics have praisingly noted, though it makes the book almost untranslatable and probably very difficult for readers unfamiliar with British English. Natalie/Keisha is the most fully realised character and has the clearest, most direct style. Shar, the desperate young woman Leah initially encounters, remembers her from high school as 'coconut'. This excellent article helped me to understand more about this racist term, and how it is used both by white and black people to criticise black people, usually because they are successful, hard working etc, as if, ridiculously, these are 'white' traits. Keisha Blake feels out of place in her own life; she seems to lack helpful role models. She changes her name to Natalie and pursues a high-powered career. There is a brilliantly crafted tension between perceptions of Natalie. She is stereotypically seen as concerned with social justice because she is black - she does not actually articulate such a commitment. Her blackness is exploited in court for this purpose - to whitewash. She is courted by controversial clients who only want to use her as a fig-leaf for their unethical behaviour. For this she is lectured by her mother and friends. Her sister and old friends snub her for being insincere and lacking self-awareness - their criticisms hurt because they are laced with painful truth. I found this piece very helpful to my understanding of the relationship between Natalie and Leah. I urgently wanted both of them to wise up, but Smith remained true to them and the realism of the novel and resisted such temptations. As it is, the book's commentary on vital, highly relevant issues of racism and sexism is sophisticated and enlightening. Another dimension was introduced in the case of Natalie's husband Frank; although black, he was raised solely by his wealthy white Italian mother and suffers a strangely nuanced isolation. His story makes me think of black (and others who are not white) children who are adopted into white families. I felt that the plot was the least successful aspect of the book; the late stages of drama were protracted and lacked the rich emotional resonance that made other parts, such as Natalie's childhood memories, so haunting and captivating. ...more Zadie Smith wrote a masterpiece debut novel when she was under 30, a story that takes place in a Northwest London borough, (but the narrative also travels to Jamaica, Turkey, and Bangladesh).

While reading, I felt as if I were living with these characters--people who struggled with race, identity, assimilation, gender politics, the immigrant experience, and more. Smith's levity eases the weighty subjects without undermining them, and the sprawl of characters, subplots, and exotic locales saturated the novel with a bold and buoyant exuberance. The immigrant experience in a post-colonial world is also a central theme in her latest book, NW. Here, her style is more existentialistic. You feel as if you are eavesdropping on conversations, sometimes desultory, or streaming a character's thoughts. Each main character has his or her specific rhythm and patois, and soon I got into the groove. It seemed a bit more challenging to stay with than all her other novels, but I enjoyed the whole, actually, more than each individual part. I felt no less gripped by the end of the novel than I had in WHITE TEETH or ON BEAUTY, but the journey here was different, way more technique-oriented to arrange a pattern of sound or a flashing glimpse. Childhood friends Keisha Blake and Leah Hanwell grew up in the council estate housing area of Northwest London. Keisha, of Jamaican ancestry, becomes a lawyer, and marries up. Red-haired Irish (ancestry) Leah, who is also educated, marries a Nigerian hairdresser and has too much goodwill guilt to leave the council flats or seek a more lucrative employment. Nevertheless, she harbors some envy toward Keisha's yuppie lifestyle. It wasn't until near the last third of the novel that I knew I was on track with the characters. Many of them stroll, or walk, a lot, and the reader is challenged to go with the flow and not try to think too much about analyzing. For much of the book, it felt like I was trying to hold a cool, airy substance in the palm of my hand. Eventually, it comes together, becomes solid, and the frame holds a picture filled with color, light, and emotional clarity. In the meantime, every short, titled section gives a clue to a character's sensibilities, such as: \"It's really an epidemic. That is, they were always there, in the same numbers as they are now, but now it is called an epidemic. A recent headline in The Standard, NORTHWEST FOX EPIDEMIC, and a photograph of a man kneeling in a garden surrounded by corpses he's shot. Dozens and dozens and dozens of them. Dozens and dozens! says Leah, and that's how we live now, defending our own little patch, it didn't used to be like that, but everything's changed, hasn't it, that's what they say, everything's changed.\" ...more This was one of those books that I wanted to enjoy more than I actually did.

When I lived in London, a million years ago, I spent my first two months in the suburbs she writes about - Willesden, Kilburn, Cricklewood - so I have a passing interest in them as real locations but when I read a novel I don't want to read about a suburb, I want to read about people. I'm not sure that Smith ever really got a handle on the story she wanted to tell - there were too many different half stories, too many detours. And the long sequence of short snapshots in the second half felt like crib notes - what you do, as a writer, when you don't have a story. I gave it three stars because she's still a really talented writer and will always be an interesting writer to read but in my view, NW wasn't one of her best. ...more At first I thought Zadie Smith was channeling Virginia Woolf in her latest novel, only instead of haute bourgeois characters, she focused on an upwardly mobile working class girl from the projects, who commits the unlikely act of doling out real money to a dirty, hysterical junkie who turns up at her door with an obviously fake story.

She channeled Rushie in White Teeth and Forster in On Beauty. She's brilliant at it, but I wasn't sure I wanted to stick around and read the whole novel. And yet I soldiered on, and she soon dropped the stream-of-consciousness impersonation for other, equally fragmentary and semi-experimental styles, pages awash in the kind of London street dialogue she's such a master of, a whole section of numbered fragments, tiny stories or scenes from the life of Leah's BFF, Natalie (a.k.a Keisha) Blake. With every page I turned, I became more engaged and more impressed with Smith's mastery of character and her deep knowledge of northwest London. By the last page she had me literally gasping.

The problem isn't that I've been trying to decide what I want to talk about, the problem is that I don't really have much to say about this book at all. The story is divided into four mini-arcs, all taking place in the same neighborhood in northwest London. We start with Leah, a white woman (the neighborhood is predominately black, and mostly Caribbean). Her section shows us several days in her life - going to work, interacting with her husband, visiting her friends, etc. Then at the end of her section, she hears about some guy being stabbed in the street. The next section is from the guy's perspective and takes place the day he was killed. Then we move on to the third section, which is about Leah's friend Natalie and provides us with background information on the girls' friendship. Then in the last section, Natalie meets up with some guy she went to school with and they wander around the neighborhood. And then the book ends. It's Zadie Smith, so the writing is incredible. Everything is very, very subtle, so that you often have to read conversations several times before you understand the subtext of what's being said. The characters are all really good - all of them are sympathetic and none of them are good, and they are all very, very real - and Smith creates a near-flawless portrait of a small isolated community. So then, what's the problem? The problem is that, lovely as the writing is, the fact remains that nothing fucking happens . We just watch four people dick around and be miserable for a while, and then the book stops. Nothing else. Normally, I wouldn't have minded this. I said in my review Hunting and Gathering that a plot is not necessary for a book to be good, and I stand by that. NW is another example of a book that's character-driven rather than plot-driven, but the problem here is that we're not driving anywhere, we're just treading water. Again, I might have been able to forgive this, but the four characters remained only tenuously connected, and the events that occur during their sections having no real effect on the outcome of the story. I wanted this to end like A Prayer for Owen Meany , where every single character and event throughout the book turns out to be an important factor in the climax, and everything fits together neatly. That doesn't happen here, and it's disappointing, and ultimately makes the book not worth the effort of reading it. ...more this novel is marvel and genius and i liked it tremendously. it is also difficult, partly at a superficial, easy-to-overcome level, partly at a deeper level. at the superficial level, zadie smith pulls in all sorts of stuff (snippets of dialogue, local idioms, local references, pop culture, local and national events of the time, etc.) which she doesn't explain. at first this is disorienting, then you get the hang of it. the deeper level is that she draws a human map of a narrow and specific part this novel is marvel and genius and i liked it tremendously. it is also difficult, partly at a superficial, easy-to-overcome level, partly at a deeper level. at the superficial level, zadie smith pulls in all sorts of stuff (snippets of dialogue, local idioms, local references, pop culture, local and national events of the time, etc.) which she doesn't explain. at first this is disorienting, then you get the hang of it. the deeper level is that she draws a human map of a narrow and specific part of the world (NW london) and the billion of us who know nothing about it are condemned to experience unease and alienation in the reading of the book. i believe this is reflected in the lowish scores here on gr. it's not nice to feel excluded. this latter feature is in fact one of the elements that make the book so fabulous. there has been a lot of discussion, at least since Gloria Anzald\u00faa (we are talking a long time! Borderlands/La Frontera came out in 1987; and most likely this discussion started before then), about (some) writers of color's refusal to accommodate mainstream (white, american) readership by translating [idioms/cultural mainstays/language] into easily digestible (to above-mentioned mainstream folks) version of themselves. in the writing of latino writers of colors, this has meant using spanish sentences without translating them, even when the book is predominantly written in english. increasingly, writers of color just write their stories without worrying about making them easily accessible to white audiences. it's not that they are inaccessible. it's that you (the white person or the person who is not of the same cultural background as the author) don't get everything . the idea is to reproduce the person of color's position as the permanent outsider, herself the person who is condemned never to be able to understand everything . in my very limited experience, unlike american writers of color, international writers still tend to do a ton of cultural and linguistic translation. sometimes this pains me. it's as if they were writing for me rather than their own people, who must certainly roll their eyes at explanations of concepts and objects that are entirely familiar to them. and maybe they are doing so for excellent reasons which we can all guess (market reasons, but also the desire to make themselves known to the rest of the world -- this may be particularly true for african writers, who are enjoying a larger and larger readership in the west). so when zadie smith writes about NW london as a place with its own very particular language and culture, and she doesn't bother translating them for us, she is inserting herself in this revolutionary tradition, a tradition that says, i'm the outsider all the time; if you want to get into my world, it's your turn to experience outsiderness and alienation . so this is what i have to say about this book's \"difficulty:\" that unless you are from NW london or other parts of the world that understand NW london's culture, there are things you just won't understand, and that's perfectly fine. it's okay not to understand. this is a very complex and rich world and you are not entitled to global understanding. you are not entitled to have everyone translate everything for you, so that you can consume it in ease and comfort. entering different cultures takes a toll. be prepared to pay it. this is not to say that this book is impenetrable. it isn't, at all. it's just occasionally uncomfortable and disconcerting, especially for the reader who is used to be catered to. this discomfort is crucial. it is crucial to experience it. it is the discomfort of the outsider. all of NW's characters are outsiders. leah because she is a white woman who grew in a predominantly non-white neighborhood and whose best friend, husband, and other friends are non-white; keisha because she is forced by her profession and, later, her rising social status to play white in ways she finds painful and awful; felix, shar and nathan -- the doomed characters who act as foil to leah's and keisha's middle-class, apparently successful stories/lives -- because they get chewed up and spat out by the train wheels. smith waves the book in such a way that the two privileged women, leah and keisha, find themselves having to deal again and again with the friends and acquaintances they left behind, often through violence. leah seems to me a good portrait of white guilt. when she was growing up she didn't mingle with the bad, mostly non-white crowd; now, as an adult, she has a do-gooder life, with a north african husband whom she however doesn't seem to respect much, and a job in an organization that helps women. the uneasy relationship between leah and husband michel seems to be the product of their playing out of pre-assigned roles: -- michel as at the moderate fuck up with a chip on his shoulder who tries to succeed fast and easy, who takes umbrage at leah's patronizing of him, who cannot quite manage to be her equal; leah as the only white woman in her office, playing maybe at being black (everyone in her life is), rescuing her unbalanced, cracked rapport with michel with mad sex (this is one of the cases in the novel in which sex functions as a bridge over muddy and polluted waters, a la let's forget out differences and fuck. it happens with keisha and with felix too). keisha tries to resist bourgeois-ation, being co-opted by an upper class, wealthy world of large houses and beautiful children until she no longer can (her husband frank is super rich). her rapport with her husband is also a non-rapport (they don't even have the sex to smooth things over), and they spend more time apart than together. the section devoted to keisha, which is written in short chapters that are on average half a page long but can be as long as a line, is beautiful -- keisha so unhappy, so out of place; tokenized at work; unable to make a life for herself that feels hers; separated from her family by accidents of life but also her increasing giving in to her husband's wealth (interestingly, both leah and keisha have foreign husband, though frank is not technically an immigrant). she is so lost that she turns to unexpected avenues to reconnect with her story, her history, her class. it's lovely and heartbreaking and poetic because of the lovely way in which it's written. the various sections are moored in time by the jamaican carnival and in space by the very specific and fastidious boundaries of NW. i have read most of what zadie smith has written and not quite loved it (though now i feel i should re-read White Teeth because it was a long time ago and i was a different person, having changed the entirety of my body's cells, including my brain's cells, a couple of times since then. she is supposed to be a comic writer but i for one didn't find much comedy in this book. then again, i'm not someone who is really good at detecting anglo-american humor. i did find, however, a massive capacity to produce unbelievable language, and an equally massive capacity for grasping the complex depths of people and/in their cultural situations. i would give anything to have zadie smith write about italians living in large american metropolises. i'm sure she would tell me much about myself that i can't articulate on my own. ...more I'm going to four-star this even though it's landing for me somewhere between a three and four, primarily because what I enjoyed does not quite make up for what I didn't enjoy or understand.

What I Liked The impressionistic writing, full of snatches of conversation and thoughts, disconnected, referential to pop culture or previous parts of the novel which one may or may not get. The brunch section was particularly kaleidoscopic, and I thought a marvel of structure and language and characterization. The sense of place and its influence and constraints - physical, cultural, socio-political. Related, the trajectory of the characters, each of of them, in terms of where they came from and where they are going. The sense that there are escapees and others, those who don't or can't or won't escape. And that the grass is not necessarily greener on either side (see Keisha/Natalie and her sister, as one example). The broader theme of identity and how it's shaped (by place, race, class, culture, socio-economics, education, etc.) but also chosen but also arbitrary and also fluid . This tension - between self-identity and the struggle to define or transcend a definition imposed on one - seems central to every character, although it plays out differently for each. It especially shows up for characters vis-a-vis their parents - Natalie, Leah, Felix - and their spouses/girl-boyfriends. Without too much more thought on this, I wonder if self exists in this novel in no way except in relation to others, and the common milieu they share? Related to this, I thought the character of Natalie - whose central goal is self-definition (she actually changes her name, that's how much she wants to be someone else - but who?), and who seems a hollow shell of a person in so many ways, someone who lacks a self of any real substance - was fascinating and compelling, however also ... What I Didn't Like (&/or Didn't Understand) disappointing. Natalie's arc is confounding to me in terms of what Smith is trying to say about and with this character. Given that her section is the longest, and her character the most intimately shown and known, this is kind of a fatal flaw for me in the novel. The last couple of chapters, stylistically and linguistically rich, are ultimately empty of meaning for me. (view spoiler) [Natalie's breakdown (is that what it is?) seems abrupt, though not unexpected. Her foray into the threesomes seems out of character in so many ways that it *must* be meaningful, but then - how? I suspect some kind of literary trick going on here, her peripatetic final disposition existing to convey some symbolic, deeper meaning that I just don't get. (hide spoiler) ] Similarly, I wish there had been stronger links between each section. Leah seems to exist as counter-point to Natalie, but her story - which started the novel and was engaging in and of itself - peters out, and is never revisited. Leah's husband Michel - a shadowy background figure - seems important in the beginning, but doesn't end up so. And Felix's section is sandwiched in the middle of the two central female characters, with references to him before and after, but ultimately these references didn't add up to anything coherent (although his story is so dramatic and poignant). Again - he is point and/or counterpoint to what, exactly? As much as I loved the impressionistic writing throughout, which early on gave the writing such energy, I started to disengage from it as the novel went on. I guess Smith gives her readers a lot of respect, and trusts that they will be able to follow along with her bouncing ball - even if it skips every second or third bounce - to put the clues together into a sensible whole. For me, though, it required too much faith. It was impossible to keep up with the unvarying, staccato rhythm with so many obscure details and dangling threads, so chunks of the novel just passed into background noise for me like the snatches of song lyrics heard on a car radio as it drives by (which happens frequently in NW). It ended up isolating me, instead of drawing me in; the experimentation - especially pronounced in the third section with its chapter snippets - changed the rhythm yet again, but also grew wearying. By the end - the very end - the novel fizzled out entirely. I was hoping for some kind of coming together of theme, character, plot. Maybe it was there and I missed it. Maybe it wasn't there at all. Maybe whether it was there or not is beside the point. You tell me. ...more A riotous and feisty stream-of-consciousness novel about four characters living in London's NW neighborhood.
