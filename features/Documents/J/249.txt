I loved the author's writing style - its very simple but very powerful and its one of those books that really makes you feel what is going on with the characters. I was completely and utterly shocked to find that I loved the Slam poetry. Boy is it powerful (I know I've used that word a lot here but it seems to be the best of that fits what I'm feeling). I've always hated poetry - was never able to absorb it or relate to it but in this book, it is so effecting in giving the reader a view of what is going on in the characters' head and heart. I loved the intensity of Will and Lake's feelings for each other. I had butterflies in my stomach for most of the book and could stop turning the pages. This book brought me to tears more than once. And my cheeks were damp throughout the whole final 10% or so. Loved it!!! This book is about love and loss and life and death (not the death of the hero/heroine though, fear not lol). I'd highly highly recommend it to pretty much anyone and everyone who loves to read. Now I understand what all the fuss was about - everywhere I looked here, people were raving about it and now I'm joining that club! I'm off to go read the sequel now - I can't wait to read more about Will and Lake...

I devoured this book. The story sucks you in and doesn't let you go. Adore Colleen Hoover and must read more of her. Well damn. Wanted to love it, but this is not my kind of romance. Not even for a YA romance. SLAMMED was angsty teenage love story with a heart wrenching sub-plot, but the heroine made it a very disappointing read. I expected a more mature minded heroine, not an overly emotional girl who thinks a mad boy crush after one date is the 'real thing'. The whole high school giggly student bit was a turn off for me. I liked Will a lot, and thought his maturity and love for poetry was well portrayed, but I didn't ge Wanted to love it, but this is not my kind of romance. Not even for a YA romance.

She made dumb choices,<---M> said dumb comments</---M>, put him at risk, and made everything be about her. Personally, I thought the author did a great job of developing a typical 18 y/o girl, but it only emphasized her lack of maturity as a lead heroine. This would have worked for me in a more adult setting, but the the teenage angst was over done. At times she was a drama queen only focused on herself, and she had no concept of how others felt. Then other times shes a silly giggly high schooler. Either way, I didn't buy her as a convincing heroine. The subplot was very good and emotional, but it was great wallpaper only. The romance needs to stand on its own, not be carried by a secondary storyline. SLAMMED is a teenage girl fantasy romance story, so it doesn't surprise me at how popular it is. But I'd prefer to read about more mature minded couples falling in love, so this one didn't cut it for me. ...more I am conducting what I'm shelving as a \"New Adult (NA) Experiment\".

I'm going to work my way through some of the popular New Adult books and see if I can weed out the crap and hopefully find some surprising gems. Here's hoping! It's been a while, my friends. I had to take a break for the sake of my sanity. I decided to return to the NA experiment with Slammed because I'd heard it was less offensive than Hoover's later novel - Hopeless - and also because I've had luck with a NA student/teacher romance in the past ( Unteachable ). Alas, I was wrong to be so optimistic. I suppose that Slammed is less offensive when compared to the creepy pro-stalker ideas being thrown around in Hopeless but it certainly makes up for it by being an example of terrible writing. Where Hopeless offered entertainment and sexual tension that made it obvious where its popularity came from, I am honestly confused by all the positive reactions to Slammed . I do think if I'd read this book first I might have at least appreciated the improvement in quality of the author's writing by the time she wrote Hopeless . In this, Hoover's writing is a couple steps below average and looks even less impressive when compared to the fantastic teacher/student romance in Unteachable (and it's beautiful writing). The author struggles with the build-up of the relationship between Layken and Will, forgetting about sexual tension and/or chemistry and jumping too quickly from their meeting to some extremely cheesy moments. The drama is constant but handled roughly - making scenes that should be heart-breaking feel emotionally manipulative and causing me to roll my eyes rather than to burst into tears. Both characters, as well as the book in general, lack any emotional maturity. Layken frequently behaves like a bratty little kid, slamming doors and calling Will names. I really had no patience for her childish antics. Though, Will wasn't much better. He would constantly lead Layken on and then blame it on a moment of weakness. More than once. It was cringy and stupid because the reader is well aware that it wasn't a moment of weakness and that he actually wants to be with Layken but he's being an immature idiot and not to mention a complete fucking tease . Just sayin'. Aside from the writing being awful, the real problem in this for me was the failure to convince me that there was any real barrier to Layken and Will's relationship. Perhaps it was because their ages were too close to give me any sense of the forbidden or because Will wasn't exactly a \"real\" teacher, but nothing about it got my heart pounding like Raeder's Unteachable . It seemed more like there was no problem except the one the two of them created in their little melodramatic minds. Angst for the sake of angst. But I wasn't buying it. I think it's fair to say that me and Ms Hoover finally part ways for good. ...more Wow! I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m only allowed to give this book five stars. It affected me on so many levels.

By \"Slammed\" As much as I don't wish to provide further details (to avoid making a very long review), I think I have to write the part that I feel so strongly about: \"I slide into the bed beside my mother and wrap my arms around her. She finds my hand and we interlock fingers as we talk without saying a single word.\" I won't lie, I cried so hard at this. My mom and I used to do the same thing when I was a kid. How many times did someone tell us to treasure our mother, or parents in general, while they're still alive? And how many times did we shrug and ignore it? Do they have to be dying before we relive the old days? The good old days when they're the most important person/s in our lives and not our social shits or boyfriends or girlfriends? You know what? We're going to spend our lives with our husband/wife LONGER than we have with our parents. Love them with all you got and don't half-ass it. So you see, this amazing book made me experience a spectrum of emotion! And yes, it absolutely \"schooled\" me. I highly-recommend!! :) ...more 2 stars.**Review posted August 11, 2013 First of all I must say that I LIKED the slamming (I don't mean the doors, I'm talking about the poetry).

I've had a few minor issues but nothing too annoying. Unfortunately a lot went downhill after that update and too many things--and especially a HIGHLY annoying and juvenile bitch--compromised the book for me. So I feel kinda like this at the moment\u2026 I have read enough books that I know what I like. Personally, the biggest letdown for me was the writing. As I mentioned already I liked the slamming; that was lovely. However, the writing in general is average at best, and after reading and loving Leah Raeder's Unteachable , I must say that Colleen Hoover's writing is not even average. Also, some parts of Slammed are too cheesy. Hence, it's safe to say that I belong to the little corner of readers who didn't enjoy Slammed, and I honestly don't understand what's so magical about this book. Before Slammed I've read God-Shaped Hole and I \"only\" rated it with four stars. Compared to Slammed, God-Shaped Hole deserves five stars--especially the second half of the book. Besides, some of the really awesome books that I've read deserve probably seven, eight, nine or ten stars--always compared to Slammed. As it is, my range is very limited. Thus, I cannot give more than 2 stars to Slammed. Sorry guys. There is way too much manufactured drama in Slammed. Lake lost her father six months ago, (view spoiler) [and her mother is dying too. She passes away at the end of the story, although it happens off page. (hide spoiler) ] The boy next door (Will) lost his parents three years ago and has to raise his brother on his own. And, since he is her teacher, they cannot see each other and that causes more drama throughout the entire plot. Crying here and crying there\u2026*rolls eyes* Will openly flirting with Lake and actually hitting on her right off the bat kind of surprised me, and I felt it was too quick. They see each other for the first time and wham\u2026within a couple of hours both of them were smitten. I didn't really buy that. Yet they don't do the deed at all. Now that sure as hell didn't add up for me. Although the initial chat-up was too fast, I would like to drive an important point home. I didn't want them to wait for more than 700 (?) pages until they hit the sheets. In fact, it's contradictory and irritating as all get out to let them eat each other up right from the beginning without getting them to fourth base within the first book. Contrived build-up, much? Ugh. The heroine is calling Will all kinds of not so nice names. She is playing the immature hurt little girl who is slamming the door on a regular basis. Very childish and ridiculous. Lake, my seven-year-old son is pretty well-versed when it comes to slamming doors. I'm sure he could give you some pointers how to improve your technique. Bad, bad Will\u2026tsk-tsk\u2026*stern look* No, let me rephrase that. Lake, you are such a whiny little bitch! Although I must cut her some slack because if Will had been a woman I would have called him a freaking cock tease!! There I said it and I feel better already. Friendly advice, Will, you can shove sentences like \"I had a weak moment. I'm sorry.\" or \"It won't happen again, I swear.\" (and then it happens again and again) up your ass! On the other hand, it doesn't excuse the heroine's juvenile and annoying behavior. Another issue that I had was Will kissing Lake on her forehead. Every time he did that I had to roll my eyes. And what annoyed the living daylights out of me was the fact that Will (view spoiler) [knocked What's His Name? on his ass out of PURE jealousy and NOT because he sexually assaulted Layken. (hide spoiler) ] Certain plot twists are the same ole same ole and so overdone it's not even funny anymore. Is there a sign saying \"Do not engage your brain. Turn it off and jump to conclusions because it's so good to throw a temper tantrum later while bawling your eyes out.\" And to put emphasis on your disapproval you need to storm off and slam your door shut (yes, I know, I have mentioned that already but it bears repeating). Wow. Now that makes you oh-so mature! It didn't make me happy, though. If anything, it's incredibly boring and such behavior is getting on my very last nerve. That's me\u2026I've got a headache\u2026 I can't help it but an extensive part of Slammed reads like a teenager's diary filled with puppy love and family drama. The book goes straight on my shelf books-everyone-loved-but-baba where it will gather some dust. I'm calling it quits coz I have no intention whatsoever to torture myself by reading Point of Retreat. Some readers told me that Lake would drive me nuts because she is assuming stuff all the time. Non-verbal communication, much? In fact, she acts worse in Point of Retreat than in Slammed. Nope, not going there. I want to stay sane and healthy. Onwards... P.S. I just hope that Will will get some in book 2 otherwise he's going to die of blue balls. I have been informed there won't be any sex in the sequel either. P.P.S. Lake, go buy a vibrator.

Actually, I do know why. I read this book in like 12 hours because it's so addicting.

Her characters were perfectly imperfect (hello Layken and Eddie giggling and making Chuck Norris jokes in detention). I am a notorious book snob. I read only the best, I recommend only the best. I cannot say enough about both the creativity, originality and depth of Slammed. A book that surely rises above all of its competition and SLAMS them in the face. I would urge Colleen Hoover to contact Stepehenie Meyer and perhaps offer her some lessons on character development and plot structuring. I would urge Colleen Hoover to keep writing stories and creating characters for those of us who are death to sick of boring, insipid characters (see I'm so clever). Or maybe Colleen is the clever one, because this book has set itself so far apart authors will be trying to catch it for years. ...more \u201cPush your boundaries, that's what they're there for.\u201d It's currently 2:10 in the morning...

The odd thing is of all of Colleen's books, I've owned this one the longest and I'm just now reading it. I HATE MYSELF FOR THAT!!!! I would never believe that this was Hoover's debut novel. It's so strong that I assumed it was a 4th or 5th book. Nope. She never fails too incorporate something new and unique into her writing, if it's paintings, music, or even poetry. She really has a style all her own. There are only three writers I will drop everything I'm\u00a0 reading to pick up their work... That's John Green, Jennifer Armentrout, and Colleen Hoover. Slammed follows the story of new Michigan transplant Lake as she is forced to start a new life her senior year of high school. After her fathers untimely death her mother can't afford to keep them living in Texas. First day in the new place Lake's brother befriends the boy next door... Introducing Lake to Will. The charming, handsome, and sweet poet. The characters in this book feel so real! Lake and Will are written too perfection. Lake, though mature for her age has the same immature moments as the rest of us. Will is just so sweet, speaking in a way that will have you swooning all over the place. Both their love towards there family captured my heart 200%. Both characters physical appearance is described just enough to give you and idea then left you to make your own decision. As the characters develop in the story the story itself grows into something so hard to capture in words. I thought that the insta-lust that happen right away was going to ruin this book for me. But at the end I realized that this story might have involved love but it's not the love you except. I wish I could explain that more but it's the only way I can say it. It about a deeper kind of love than just being with someone. The sub characters like Eddie and the baby brothers... PHENOMENAL. Colleen has it so they are sub character that manage to shine so much light without ever over powering. The plot has this pace between fast and medium, and it was at a rate I'd never experienced before. Then of course there's the whole poetry and music aspect that was put into this story. It's what takes this book to the next level. The poetry is introduced in the first handful of pages. I didn't know how I was going to feel about it... BUT WOW . Seriously the first poem had me in tears and they only got better from there. The quotes from The Avett Brothers are perfect placed and were just a nice little treat at the stat of every chapter. Like I said, this is a story you need to go into blind, therefore I can't, even though I want to, go into more detail. This book started strong and then had me a blubbering mess. I don't know if I should be mad or thankful that Colleen is constantly finding new ways to tear my heart out of my chest. I don't think I've ever not been a mess at the end of one of her books. This story made me laugh a hundred times, and cry at least five. Slammed is one beautiful, quotable, and poetic line one after another. Slammed touched me on such a personal level I probably cried harder than most. This book is a must read, and definitely made it's way into my all time favorites.

I cannot remember the last time I was so touched, so inspired, so intrigued, so consumed with a book as I was with Slammed. The slam poetry was utterly brilliant and the story to go along with it was damn near perfection. Layken (aka Lake) is an eighteen year old who has just moved away from everything she's ever known as \"home\" after her fathers sudden death. She needs and tries so hard to be the rock that her little brother, Kel, and mother can lean on. On moving day, she meets her neighbors from across the street, Will and his little brother, Caulder. It was pretty much love at first sight...for the little brothers as well. I loved the dynamics of the kids' relationship. How easy it is to just accept and be happy at that age... Will asks Lake on a date and it's unlike any typical date she's been on before. None of the boring questions about how many siblings, dogs, cats, etc.. Then he brings her to a Slam session. She is thoroughly enjoying herself and begs him to do a slam for her, he volunteers, does his slam and the rest is history... Three days ago, I was devastated, bitter, and hopeless. Today I woke up feeling happy for the first time in months. Will did that for Lake, in all the months that had passed and while her unhappiness began to consume her, he helped her to see life in a different way... ...Then a devastating revelation happens....and then another, and you think to yourself, WHY??? Why can't everything just be okay?!... Throughout the course of the book, Lake and Will had to face some of the toughest obstacles any two people could ever or should ever have to face. I would like to think that Lake's best friend Eddie helped to keep her grounded, she was one of my favorite characters in the book; her joy leaped off of the pages to me and I found myself smiling every time she would give off her words of wisdom... This book had me going through so many emotions. I had a lot of ups and downs, tears of sorrow and tears of contentment, grins and frowns. My heart beat rapidly at times for the hope of a solution and beat rapidly at times for the nervousness of what was to come... So many adversities to overcome, so many issues to work through, so many questions of priority. Through poetry so much is revealed of how one copes with things, deals with feelings; pouring their soul out to a captive audience. Why? Because it speaks volumes: The ways these poets are able to lure you into a whole new world, viewing things from a vantage point you've never seen before. Making you feel like you are the mother who lost her baby, or the boy who killed his father, or even the man who got high for the first time... This was so much more than a book to me, it put so many things into perspective, it touched me on a deeper level. At the first slam, I knew this would be one of my favorite books of all time, now that I'm done? I'm glad to see that I was right! I would give this book WAY more than 5 stars if GR would let me, but for now, know that I absolutely LOVED this book and am excited to read more of Layken and Will's story in the sequel! In closing, I will leave you with this... Be accepting of everything. People's differences, their similarities, their choices, their personalities. Sometimes it takes a variety to make a good collection. ...more I just read this whole thing on a plane and WOW. This is one of the best contemporaries I've read in a long time.

At first, I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy the book - that's just me being honest. I thought it hugged the romance 'formula' a little too much for my taste. I admit, I might have walked in with that preconceived notion. However, as I kept reading, I found myself connecting with the emotions in the book. I loved the poetry. I loved the message. SPOILER ALERT! My dad past away several years ago. I don't like to think about it. I don't like to read about death and how to cope. I'm more of a push your emotions down into your stomach until they make you sick type of girl - lol. I cried when Layken found that barrette. I find things sometimes and I just sit there and stare. I empathized with the anger the characters felt over the eventuality of Layken's mother's prognosis. My dad was diagnosed with cancer and was told he would live 6 months. He lived 6 years, but the time never seemed like enough. Also, I was angry about the fact he kept drinking after he was diagnosed. I felt like he was doing it on purpose - shaking his fist at my anger and grief. I understood Will and Layken's acceptance. Once my father died, I realized he had lived his life the way HE wanted. He deserved that. Everyone deserves to go their own way. I am still here. I have to find my own way. I forgave him a long time ago. By the end of this book, I was in tears and thinking about my dad, but more than that, I was thinking, 'Colleen Hoover deserves every ounce of her success'. She has written something very special. Like any author worth a shit - she parted with a piece of her soul. I take it with me. I'm the fan girl, Colleen.

Immediately after pulling up with the moving van, Lake meets the neighbor across the street, Will, and his little brother Caulder.

Lake is happy that at least this move won't suck for her little brother. Although things start looking up for Lake when Will asks her out on a date. Will is so different from most guys and so forward. It shocks Lake a little. Their first date is different and in my opinion, amazing! He takes her to a poetry slam which before reading this, I had no idea what it was. It's where people get up in front of an audience and perform a piece of poetry they've written. It's not typical poetry, more like a soul-bearing piece, written and then performed. She's is mesmerized by the first performance and then when Will gets up and performs his, she's a goner! She is taken by him and falls hard, and fast. And he's fallen hard for her, too. Here's a quote from that night that gives me shivers: \"Patience.\" he whispers. You don't think that's much? Wait until you read the scene! Lake discovers she has a lot in common with Will. Unfortunately straight after this date, they discover a block to their relationship and have to keep apart. Here's a heartbreaking quote for you: \"God Layken. How do you do it?\" she says. \"How do I do what?\" I sniff as I continue to wipe the tears from my eyes. \"How do you not fall in love with him?\" The tears begin flowing just as quickly as they had ceased\u2026..\"I don't not fall in love with him. I don't not fall in love with him a lot!\" Add to this, Lake's mom is all of a sudden leaving often for unexplained errands. As suddenly as things seemed to be falling in place, everything has fallen apart. I can't tell you how much I loved this story. I connected so deeply with Lake and Will. I adored the little brothers, Caulder and Kel, and Lake's mom too (even though I was a little angry with her for some things). My heart was pulled in lots of different directions. The reason Lake and Will must stay apart is not Will's fault, but you can't help but blame and get mad at him for his actions. Even when you know you shouldn't. Lake writes and recites a poem and you're right there cheering her on. I know I'm being vague, but I seriously don't want to spoil this for any who haven't read it. This story pulls on all your heart strings! There's also a fair amount of humor in this story that lifts the mood in just the right places. This was such a heartwarming story! I read the sequel straight after because I didn't want to let these character go! Don't let the fact that this is a self-published novel fool you. This was a truly amazing debut for Colleen Hoover. I'll definitely be reading whatever she writes next.

Waves that have words floating in them like original and heart-breaking and tear-jerker and romantic and deep and thought-provoking. Waves that, quite unfortunately, led me believe that at least some of these qualities, if not all, would be present in Slammed. Needless to say, I was terribly disappointed by the story I found within the covers of this ever-so-popular novel and Slammed failed to make me join its wave of ardent supporters. First and foremost, I need to give credit where credit is due. I knew absolutely nothing about slam poetry before I read Colleen Hoover\u2019s debut novel, so she gets immediate props for incorporating a rich, unique, and original idea into this tale. Unfortunately, that\u2019s where the originality comes to an end. Slammed starts off with Layken (Lake) moving to Michigan after the sudden death of her father and, like so many female protagonists these days, she immediately meets a dashing young man \u2013 Will. Will is twenty-one, handsome, sweet, and Layken is half in love with him the first time they meet. After the second chapter, where Layken and Will go on \u2013 what I must admit \u2013 is a rather amazing first date, Layken couldn\u2019t be more excited to have moved to Michigan. That\u2019s when things begin to go downhill. Enter the classic obstacle: forbidden love. Layken and Will quickly realize that they can\u2019t be together (view spoiler) [ because Will is actually Layken\u2019s poetry teacher and he didn\u2019t realize she was still in high school (hide spoiler) ] and Layken\u2019s life is turned upside down, for the second time in a matter of months. If Layken\u2019s growing attraction to her off-the-limits neighbor isn\u2019t enough on her plate, her brother and Will\u2019s brother are best friends (making Will rather unavoidable), her father\u2019s death still hangs over her like the plague, and her mother just may be hiding away the biggest secret of all. Slammed had an immense amount of potential \u2013 potential that could have been changed into a truly fantastic story \u2013 if only this had been further edited, poked, and prodded before going into publication. I had a problem with Slammed from the very beginning because Will and Lake\u2019s love story was simply too unbelievable. I definitely believe that two people can have a connection when they meet \u2013 one that makes them want to go on a date although they\u2019ve only known each other for hours. I can also believe that a first date may go so splendidly that you end up really liking the person. What I can\u2019t believe is that after a first date you find it physically painful to have to stay away from a person because you\u2019ve already fallen in love with them. Yes, it is probably hard to distance yourself, but Will and Lake had so much passion and steam and lust between them that it felt as if they had known each other for years, not days. It felt far too unrealistic to me. Furthermore, since this entire romance was practically the plot for the whole story, I was constantly reminded about the implausibility of their depth of feelings for each other. I suppose for a serial drama this would suffice, but not for a contemporary romance novel. If Will and Layken\u2019s love story had been better developed and had more than two chapters devoted to it, I would have definitely liked this book a lot better than I did. That being said, Slammed did have a lot of ideas working for it: - Tragic Pasts. Nearly every single YA character has some type of tragic or traumatic past, but I felt as if Will, Layken, and Eddie\u2019s past traumas were very realistically portrayed. Eddie, for those of you who haven\u2019t read Slammed yet, is Layken\u2019s best friend and perhaps my favorite character in the story. She, in my opinion, has suffered through so much more than the other characters and yet she still manages to face her life with spunk, happiness, and joy. Furthermore, I loved the little life lessons sprinkled throughout the unfolding of this story \u2013 lessons learned from Will, from Layken, and from their interactions with one another. It was sweet and added an informative element to the story that only made it better. - Relationships. I don\u2019t mean romantic relationships, because you all know how I felt about that one. I\u2019m talking about the relationship Will and Layken had with their younger brothers. I too have a younger brother and can speak from experience and aver that it was very realistic and heart-warming. I also loved how Layken\u2019s relationship with her mother unfolded and progressed. Although I found it a tad bit unrealistic while I read it at first, it grew on me and I realized that if I found out something that traumatic about my own mother, I would probably react in a similar manner \u2013 denial. So, all in all, the non-romantic relationships were deep, thoughtful, and provocatively written. This brings me to my next point \u2013 a negative one mind you \u2013 about originality. I already said that Hoover incorporated an original idea of slam poetry into this story and I truly enjoyed that, but either than that, this story was shockingly lacking uniqueness. Will and Layken\u2019s relationship played out like a typical forbidden romance plays out \u2013 aka an endless game of making out and then walking away and then talking and then making out and then walking away again. It was frustrating and honestly, I wasn\u2019t very invested into their story. I liked Layken and Will as individual characters and I liked them as friends, but somehow when they were together as a couple, I never really saw what was so amazing about the two of them. Furthermore, just when I felt like I was about to give Layken a high-five for moving on, something always happened to make her go back or re-question her decision or something! There was no closure until the end and although the ending was dripping, diabetically, insanely sweet and cute, I felt as if I was choking on endless spoonfuls of clich\u00e9. Speaking of clich\u00e9s, the manner in which Layken\u2019s mother\u2019s secret was handled was also immensely clich\u00e9. In fact, it felt as if half the scenes came straight out of the movie Stepmom and all the truly heart-wrenching aspects of this type of a relationship and situation were taken out and replaced by another sickly sweet epilogue. I admire Hoover for tackling on such an important and serious event and I commend her for putting together so much tragedy and pain into one story, but at the end of the day, it just didn\u2019t work. Slammed would probably be better suited as a movie rather than a book because all the details I wanted, the thoughtful insights I yearned to glean, and the provocative ideas that were supposed to be floating in my mind all night never came. Instead, I was just given a giant dose of romance \u2013 which wasn\u2019t bad, but I was expecting a lot more. Slammed is the perfect book if you\u2019re looking for a light, easy, and albeit dramatic read. It\u2019s a quick page turner, it keeps your interest, but it never made me shed a tear. It also never inspired any true emotion in me except for laughter in certain parts and ended up being a lot more vapid than I originally anticipated. For such a popular book, Slammed has a strangely clich\u00e9 and unoriginal story. Will I be continuing with this series? Yes, because there\u2019s only one more book and as much as I didn\u2019t like this one, I\u2019m hoping the second one will be better. Plus, there\u2019s something almost cathartic about slam poetry \u2013 I\u2019m slowly starting to love it. If you pick up Slammed for any reason, pick it up for the poetry. That, more than anything else in the book, is truly worth the hype. ...more Holy hell. I read this in 6 hours. I don't even remember if I fed the kids dinner or who put them to bed.

Whether it hit the right spot just for me, or it will have the same effect on other people, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just telling you- it moved me. This book is not your normal story. It\u2019s like a snapshot of a small portion of a Layken\u2019s life. It\u2019s not intended to tell the story of Layken or even go in-depth over any of Layken\u2019s problems. As a reader, you get to peak into a small part of Layken. While it is a small part, it is full of pain, heartache, discovery, laughter, and growth. I loved this. You are literally dropped into the problem, and once the problem is resolved, you are dropped out of it (the end). You wonder, well what now? That feeling of unanswered questions made me realize how quickly I fell into Layken\u2019s life. I craved more. That doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t satisfied with what I got. It doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t think the little taste of Layken\u2019s life wasn\u2019t amazing, it just means I want more. Layken and Will and \u201cthe brothers\u201d were amazing. The banter, the emotions, the problems, was so heartbreakingly real that I could read page after page of interaction between the four of them. Add in a mother with a very profound secret, a twist that puts a wall up between Layken & Will, some well-developed minor characters, and you then have one new fan of Colleen Hoover- ME! ...more 2.5 stars A lot of potential, but I think this one tried to tackle too many issues without exploring any one of them with enough depth and focus for my taste. And please, if you have a character who is a teacher, let's have him know how to conjugate the word \"lie\" correctly! Still, with more editing and thematic/character development, I think this author might have interesting things to offer in the future. Definitely interested in seeing what happens with the sequel. *Honestly, if you loved this novel don't read this review* \"I don't know which Kennedy,\" he would say. \"I love them all!\" And that's how she was named Layken Disclaimer: There is no mature content.

I can only see it as a \"YA\" posing as a \"New Adult\". (I edited the diss, because I knew the other one would really get me some hate) Okay, so this story revolves around a young woman named Layken. But you can call her Lake. Here's a list of the names I've had to endure in this genre: Woods, Hunter, Sin, Rush.... And now... Lake. Why not just: Shrub, Leaf, and Compost? If you loved her name, then you'll also love the love interest! He's so swoon, just listen to his poetry, here's a snippet: \"-If you\u2019ve ever tried swimming a shore when your leg gets a cramp and you just had a huge meal of In-N-Out burgers that\u2019s weighing you down, and her roaring waves are knocking the wind out of you, filling your lungs with water as you flail your arms, trying to get someone\u2019s attention...\" (And this was a snippet from his best poem, sadly) So like let's get to Layken, she is not your average teenager. Lake is selfless, mature, and REALLY GOOD AT POETRY! Take a look!: \u201cAccording to the thesaurus... and according to me... there are over thirty different meanings and substitutions for the word mean. (I quickly yell the following words; the entire class flinches- including Will) Jackass, jerk, cruel, dickhead, unkind, harsh, wicked, hateful, heartless, vicious, virulent, unrelenting, tyrannical, malevolent, atrocious, bastard, barbarous, bitter, brutal, callous, degenerate, brutish, depraved, evil, fierce, hard, implacable, rancorous, pernicious, inhumane, monstrous, merciless, inexorable. And my personal favorite\u2014asshole. \u201d Let me tell you how she's so mature , she's known this guy for three days and been on one date with him and then she finds out he's HER TEACHER. I know! (P.S. I understand what slam poetry is, but the context of what she wrote was disrespectful to a person who had done nothing wrong and also problematic) Let me continue: He doesn't want to date her anymore because, HE COULD LOSE HIS JOB, WHICH HE NEEDS TO SUPPORT HIS LITTLE BROTHER. But Layken is totally selfless , cause she would've kept it a secret. What a jerk right!? How dare he not risk his future for a girl he's known for three days Now let's get real... Layken and her family move to a new city after the passing of her father. After feeling alone for such a long time she runs into her cute and available neighbor. They immediately hit it off and go on a date. For once Layken doesn't feel so alone anymore, but as we all know, life happens. Her heart is thrown in a whirl wind once she finds out that Will is her teacher. The chances of love now look grim, but Layken wants to fight for him. In a book about forbidden love and life's constant road blocks, watch two very similar people try to make life work. But can they really fight the inevitable? Can you truly fight destiny? (see guys I gave it a nice description! You don't have to attack me now.) There were various problems I had with this novel. A big part being the romance and message. If anything this book lacked plot and story line. The characters fell flat and so did the chemistry. The MC was clingy, possessive, in addition to being childish. If you plan on reading this book prepare for a lot of door slamming, crying, and name calling. Now let me point out the very big gaping flaws: \"The man I'm falling in love with.\" This was said after one date and only a days after just meeting him. How is this not insta-love? In addition to it being insta-love, there's no room for any logical sense, then again the idea of it doesn't fit in general. \"How can I spend so much time with him and not know he's my teacher?\" Again, they've been on one date and known each other for three days . May I add, they only spent two of these three days together... for short periods of time. The love interest saying he would quit his job if it weren't that he had someone to support. He would quit...for her. She wants to quit school and get a GED to be with him. The MC suggests this to the love interest who she barely knows. \"If thunder had a smell, I imagine Will would smell like it.\" This is incredibly cheesy and creepy, for a matter of fact. Some other cringe worthy moments were when she constantly came onto him after a formal rejection. She also professed her love to him while they were not together. Honestly I can't see how the author would think we could relate to Layken, she's manipulative, naive, and selfish. How so? have you not seen the quotes I've used. I think it's quite obvious already. The message behind this book was very lost. Everything that wasn't \"romantic\" about the novel was rushed. It seemed like the \"conflicts\" were just thrown in there to give more meaning/drag the book. There were too many failed attempts at creating a plot. \u201cI got schooled this year by a boy. A boy that I'm seriously, deeply, madly, incredibly, and undeniably in love with. And he taught me the most important thing of all... To put the emphasis On life .\u201d Yes let me put some emphasis on life by not enduring another novel like this one. Overall thoughts: P.S. There truly isn't any reason to send me hate through the comments since this is my personal opinion. I described the book formally without any snark as well. If you did indeed enjoy this novel, then that's great. I'm glad you were able to! Having different opinions does not mean you have to get upset. ...more This book was awful.

Pretty much every heart string I have was not tugged, but aggressively yanked, until I couldn't help the hicuppy sobs that were escaping me. Lake is an 18 year old girl who along with her 9 year old brother are abruptly uprooted from her comfy home in TX when their father dies of a sudden heart attack. Without much of an explanation, other than she was offered a better paying job in MI, Lake's mom treks her and Kel, across the country. When they arrive at their new home in MI, Lake's life is once again uprooted when she meets Will, their new neighbor, and one after another, bombs of unwelcome surprises continue to go off around her, shattering her entire life as she knew and wanted it to be. Ok, I tried... but that synopsis didn't even come close to touching on the emotional roller coaster that is Slammed. These characters are so well fleshed out, and so likable, you actually feel like your sitting along side Lake and Will as they're in the club listening to Slam poetry. The poetry is like a character onto itself... The author did an amazing job creating a character driven book filled with such a complicated plot. She \"showed\" me everything that was happening to these people, instead of \"telling\" me in some monotonous, boring detail that Lake was feeling sad about what was happening to her relationship with her mother, brother, new best friend, and Will. I felt Lake's pain. I had the puffy eyes to prove it! As to why this book was so terrible??? I had tears in my eyes for the entire last 45% of the book. No joke, no exaggeration... I had a hard time reading because everything was swimming around in my pathetic tears. I really wouldn't change anything about this book. Only my timing on reading it... I wish I would have held out until next weekend. My husband is going to be gone and I could have cried in peace. Instead I had to try and explain that I couldn't explain why I was bawling like a baby. *** This was just as good in audio, and just as many tears the second time around. ...more Buy this book on AMAZON or buy this book on BookDepository with FREE WORLDWIDE SHIPPING I just finished reading this title.
