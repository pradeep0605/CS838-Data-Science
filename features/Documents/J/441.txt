There are some awesome action sequences, but no gratuitous feeding scenes, screaming teenagers, or B-horror movie cliches or gore. It's more of a novel about journalism, the right to information and free speech, and the personal and political ramifications of a wide-spreading disease. With occasional zombie action. This is also not necessarily a young adult novel. Not because it's inappropriate in any way, but because the themes it addresses are hard and sometimes the narrative is pretty dry. In the year 2039, Georgia and Shaun Mason, along with their friend Buffy (<---B>recognize any zombie-related names there?</---B>), are invited to cover Senator Ryman's presidential campaign in a world in which the Kellis-Amberlee virus has decimated the country's population and resources. Traditional news organizations have given way to the rise of internet journalism, and the trio of young bloggers must uncover a terrible conspiracy and disseminate information to their readers, all while risking their very lives. The strengths in this novel include incredibly well thought-out world-building, strong characters, snappy dialogue, unexpected plot twists, and excellent action sequences. <---A>Mira Grant</---A>'s attention to detail in <+++>Feed</+++> regarding precautionary measures, sterilization procedures, and waiting for heart-pounding test results all rang very true. (Richard Preston's The Hot Zone: A Terrifying True Story scared the bejesus out of me when it was first published in 1999, and for awhile I was fascinated by the CDC and read a lot of books about various outbreaks and plagues.) Georgia, who is the primary narrator, is a butt-kicking heroine with a huge amount of integrity, and I loved her adopted brother Shaun, who sports both a cheerfully bantering demeanor and a crossbow. I have a healthy amount of respect for their efforts to survive and for their pursuit of truth, which often came at great cost to themselves and to those they hold dear. This is not to say that this is a perfect novel. There are overly long info-dumping passages (they are intelligently written and provide necessary back story, but they are info-dumps all the same) that would have been better served with more dialogue; a surprisingly uncomplicated, easy-to-spot villain; and some aspects of Georgia and Shaun's relationship that were teased but perhaps a bit unexplored. I wish there was also better build up of tension, a few more zombie encounters, less politics (a personal preference, though, since I find politics a big snoozefest), a less prolonged ending following a major game-changing event, and a little more emotion throughout the book. Overall, I think the spareness of prose and Georgia's all-business approach worked within the context of the story, but because I'm always looking for emotional connection, I would liked to have seen it spread out in more than just a couple of places. However...the scenes with emotional impact pack a gigantic wallop. It's hard to surprise me these days with unexpected story twists, but this one managed to do it not once, but twice--and the outcomes of both those revelations ratchet up the stakes in a way that nothing else could have. I had early, anxious worries about the ending, but things didn't unfold the way I expected--and it still didn't prepare me for the tears that flowed freely and the awful ache in my throat, both of which still come and go as I think about the book. That characters would still, in such extreme and tragic circumstances, behave with such integrity and nobility and selflessness and love, just wrenches my heart. To be honest, this would probably normally be a 4 star review because of points I mentioned. But because of its heartrending and unforgettable ending, it gets 4.5 stars from me. I think as readers, most of us go through dozens and dozens of books hoping to find that one book that shatters our expectations and leaves us speechless with unexpected feeling. For me, <+++>Feed</+++> is one that definitely does that. ******************** Here is my spoiler-free review of the sequel (which is okay to read even if you haven't read FEED). Reminder : DO NOT READ the synopsis for the second book in the trilogy, however, as it spoils major plot points for this first book. ...more I think my Venn diagram says it all. What? It doesn't?

There are several sections of Feed that really slow down the pacing. At points, I felt like I was running around an empty track. At others, someone had tied concrete blocks to my feet and I was running in quicksand. I am so happy that I finished it my second time through, though I have to admit that my motivation to do so was increased by 1) the fact that I was reading with a friend and 2) several of my Goodreads friends sing this book's praises. The ultimate strength of this novel is in the characters. Adopted brother and sister, Georgia and Shaun, hold the entire story together with their bond. I grew to really enjoy some of the side characters as well, though it was clear to me who was up to no good before their big reveals. I think the reason I didn't love this as much as some of my friends is that I felt it could've been at least 100 pages shorter than it was. (If not more) The beginning solidified Georgia and Shaun's familial situation and their friendship with Buffy, as well as the entire world they were living in and the blogging atmosphere. I was hooked. The ending was just fantastic. It was the middle that was rough going and it makes me nervous to start the second Newsflesh book--will it be a blog slog again? ...more This book is about mobs of mindless zombies influencing American politics.

In the year 2014, genetically engineered viruses mutated and caused the dead to come back to life and start munching on people like senior citizens at a casino buffet. Over 20% of the world\u2019s population got gobbled up like popcorn shrimp, and in 2040 the threat of the still existing virus and zombies has changed life forever. Since the virus is present in everyone\u2019s system, when anyone dies, whether it\u2019s from zombie bite or natural causes, they will turn into one of the undead cannibals. Large gatherings of people rarely occur, everyone\u2019s homes and cars are fortresses equipped with high tech screening equipment and huge areas (like Alaska) have been given up as zones too hazardous to enter without special permits and training. <---C>Georgia Mason</---C> and her brother Shaun are part of the new generation of bloggers. Georgia is a straight Newsie, reporting only the facts and trying to get past the spin. Shaun is kind of like one of the guys on Jackass who goes out to taunt the undead while recording and posting his exploits. When they are offered a chance to follow the presidential campaign of a senator it\u2019s a chance for them to move to the head of the pack of web journalists. However, when the senator\u2019s caravan is the victim of a zombie attack the Masons get caught up in a dangerous conspiracy. This was a pretty unique zombie tale with some very good ideas in it. The explanation for the way the virus works is one of the more thought out causes of the undead I\u2019ve read. It also shows a lot of thought of what the media of the future is going to look like with competing websites featuring a mix of news/opinion/death defying features and even fiction. Mira Grant has created a tale of how the fear of external threats can become an everyday part of society that\u2019s ripe for exploitation. However, at 600 pages it feels a bit overstuffed. We\u2019re repeatedly walked through the blood screenings and other security measures that are part of society to the point of boredom. Georgia has an eye condition due to the zombie virus present in her system, and there are about 1236 instances of security guys demanding that she take off her prescription sunglasses and the problems it causes. And for a book where the threat of zombies is ever present, there are very few actual zombie attacks in it. I couldn\u2019t quite wrap my head around the Mason\u2019s role in this story. They\u2019re supposed to be young journalists on their way up, but somehow Georgia\u2018s reports quickly become must reading on the web as she instantly became an expert on presidential politics her first time covering a campaign. Also, Georgia and Shaun are constantly looking down their noses at everyone around them for being \u2018amatuers\u2019 when it comes to dealing with zombies because (as we are repeatedly reminded) they are licensed and trained journalists with extensive time in the field. So these young people are apparently the only ones with the smarts, experience and ability to see what\u2019s going on and everyone, including a US senator, defers to them to an unbelievable degree. Still, this was fun mash-up of a zombie story and a political/ conspiracy thriller with some interesting predictions about where the new media will take us. I\u2019ll probably check out the next one in the series, but I hope there\u2019s more brain munching and fewer blood tests in the second book. ...more This is not a zombie book, or at least not a zombie book in the way it is marketed.

It kicks off with a bang and some zombie action and then that's it . When I buy a book on the understanding it's about zombies, I do actually expect to, you know, experience them. Mira Grant assumes otherwise. Two things that genuinely confused me; -- The pop culture references to the current world. Considering the fact this book is set 20 years in the future, in a completely different world and society and...people still remember Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Irwins are named after Steve Irwin, who, by the time all this takes place, is long dead. The whole George Romero thing irked me although I'm not really sure why. I understand his movies more or less catapulted zombies into mainstream culture but his most recent movies have flopped so hard people are wondering why he's still making them. I'm not ratting on the guy (Day Of The Dead was the movie that got me into zombies), I'm just saying I don't buy him having a god like status in society. -- The lack of anything sexual. Why? I'm not saying I expected it, or really that the book would have been better with some sex scenes but Grant avoided them to obviously, going as far as the categorically state both Georgia and Shaun are celibate with such abruptness my 'icky sex' radar went through the damn roof. It didn't help that she went to noticeable lengths to point out that they only needed each other, no one else under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I'm all for siblings being close but Grant failed massively and just made me suspicious some kind of relationship beyond brother/sister was going on. I was honestly expecting some kind of incest (they're adopted but have been brought up together. Not sure if that counts) subplot to come out and bite me. Georgia, for me, was a huge irritant. She was possibly an author insert and definitely a Mary Sue. She's awkward and hates the lime light yet gets lots of it, even though she tries her hardest to avoid any attention. She's the head of the team yet hates the recognition this gives her. She claims to deliver nothing but the truth, despite her blog posts being nothing but her opinion. She has an eye condition (another thing Grant doesn't let you forget) that means she's sensitive to light and can't go without her epic sunglasses. This takes nothing away from her appearance other than to make her look moody and cool. If my memory serves me right, someone even likens her to a rock star. On the occasions that she wears contact lenses, she wears bright blue colored ones so she can make people feel uncomfortable. Maybe Grant is under the illusion this is a flaw in some way (much like apparently being clumsy and falling over a lot is, ala Bella Swan) but it's obviously another way of showing how cool Georgia is. There was one passage when she even avoids a hug off of a well meaning woman who has been nothing other than kind to her because she didn't want to have to touch her/be touched. Hugs last about 3 seconds and she made it sound like touching this woman was akin to licking dog shit. What a rude dick. She cannot create good, believable characters. This is my biggest pet peeve. None of them (least of all Georgia and Shaun) can have a conversation without cracking juvenile one liners and generally showing how bad ass they are. And then there's the constant references to the blood testing kit. It was ok the first time, but 40th? Nope. I get it, it's a dangerous place to live (judging by the lack of zombie action, it's not really, but I'll pretend to go along with Mira anyway). I don't need to be constantly reminded every time they want to open a door. It's not like it's mentioned in detail the once, she go into detail every single time. The writing is repetitive to a point bordering on infuriating. If I had to read 'This is my brother Shaun, he pokes things with sticks!' one more time I probably would have burst a valve. She evens makes a reference to 'reaching for the stick' in the interview at the back. It wasn't funny the first time. Stop it. I really, genuinely do not like this book. The more I think about it the more it pisses me off. I'm sorry but I'm not buying any of it. Ps, the 'fictionals' made me want to smash my head off a wall. Wtf did she get that from? Pps, stereotyping and judging is not good, Mira. The only female politician is described as having big fake boobs, zero brain cells and no real talents other than squeezing her ta-ta's together. Whether or not that's Georgia with a case of The Bitchies I don't know, but it's not exactly fair and reeks of pathetic insecurity. The stereotyping? Oh dear. The only English character drops 'bloody hells' all over the place and has a blog called...'Fish & Clips'. I shit you not. Mira needs a holiday somewhere-outside-of-America.

i don't think anyone in 2040 will be remembering them. there is nostalgia, and then there is just foolishness. but other than that, i enjoyed the details that were original and specific to this particular zombie world. that is always my favorite part of these kinds of books: what the author is contributing to the mythology that is unique to their story. the only reason i didn't like this as much as the two books that i really loved is because it is more of a traditional zombie story - an action story with political cover-ups and a central mystery and numerous action sequences. the books i found particularly great were more tricksy in the way they used the zombies. but that doesn't mean i am not going to read the second one. or the e-book short stories. i am curious to see where she takes the story, now that THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THIS BOOK HAVE HAPPENED. is my version of dancing around spoilers. all i know is that i liked this book, and even though i had to write some damn paper in the middle of it, which made my house look like this for a week or so: (which looks totally cluttered, but is actually very carefully arranged.), i still was very interested in getting back to this book, and it was easy to fall back into its world when i needed a break from academia. i am going to read the second part later in the week, and then i guess wait patiently for the third part. as a bonus, here is a picture of my cat in a drawer. man, i have lost the knack for writing book reports. i all dizzy from learning. who wants to read a paper about readers' advisory?

SNORE! \u2605 \u2605 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 2 Stars for some pretty shoddy writing at times. many times. no, i don't need to hear snarky comments made every other paragraph - because that's the way young adults on tv talk, not real young adults. at least not 100% of the time. and no, i don't need to read incensed reactions to hyper-vigilant security protocols every single time that a security protocol happens . good grief, enough is enough! repetition does not make this heart grow fonder. the second time this happened, i grimaced. the third time it happened, i began to hold a grudge. by the time it happened for the umpteenth time, yo, i was cursing up a muthafucking storm, for real. also, characterization for supporting characters: WEAK. i find out that Buffy was \"the funniest person\" that Shaun ever knew - and yet the reader has been given no evidence of this. in fact the reader has been given no evidence whatsoever that Buffy even has a personality beyond an OCD desire to be technologically on top of things. and at the end i find out that the nonentity known as \"Rick\" is now a vice-presidential candidate? uh, whatever. words can't convey my feelings of derision at that announcement. \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2606 \u2606 3 Stars for Overall Enjoyment. i, as the stars say, \"Liked It\". would i recommend it? no, probably not, except maybe to a teenager (although, duh, that's the target audience, mark, get a grip!). so despite the above complaints, and see below, overall this wasn't a disagreeable experience for me. the zombie attacks were sparse, and despite being a zombie lover, i appreciated their sparseness - it rather lifted this book above straight-up horror. and this is, i suppose, a bonafide YA novel... so i also really, really, really appreciated the lack of Corny Eyerolling Romance Lite. thank you, author! 3 Stars should be automatic for any novel that has intelligent goals behind its design, that seeks to entertain but also seeks to provoke and to make the reader both think and feel. 3 Stars for getting that right. \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2606 4 Stars for Edjumakation for the Youth. i am probably going to sound like an old man here (what's new), but the lessons in this novel actually are pretty important. and i think it is really important that The Young People, whoever they are, listen up. for real. the whole novel is an obvious parallel for what is happening in the States RIGHT NOW. or i guess what could be happening in the forseeable near-future. the U.S. is at a very dangerous crossroads as we speak, with religious fundamentalists and sociopathic assholes in political power (and often in collaboration with parts of the mainstream media), and poised to turn this country into Taliban Lite in terms of both domestic and foreign policy. yes, that's an exaggeration, but a purposeful one. now i love my conservative friends, so no offense to you all, but elements of the right-wing have degraded debate to a point where \"debate\" is simply a game of chicken. who can go the farthest? who can block the most policies? who can call who a communist or anti-american or [enter pathetic cliche here]. i think all the viciousness of the extreme right-wing quasi-fundamentalists is simply the viciousness of a group of close-minded, money-grubbin bullies who smell that the wind is blowing against them. but they are still in power! and they want to remain in power! and they have the resources to accomplish their disgusting dreams. so yeah, i appreciate all the points laid out so energetically in Feed. kids, teens, young adults, whatever... people should know what exactly is happening, and they should be pissed off and angry. the time for old men like myself is fading fast. and i'm not even that old - but me and my friends' main concerns these days seem to be more about day-to-day things involving work and family. and vacations. it was different when i was younger - i was angry! and broke, with very little in the way of tangible responsibilities. nowadays i just want to make sure i do the right thing on a daily basis - if i can say i've accomplished that, i've had a good day. so i really hope all the folks who are younger than me, all the folks who are inheriting this country and the earth... i hope that they are pissed off, angry, and that they want change. and for that, Feed is a 4 Star Call-to-Arms. well, not \"arms\" as in guns. you know what i mean. anyway, i really admire Feed's passion and its anger. i truly appreciate it. \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 5 Stars for that one chapter, and the one before it, and the one after. you know the ones i mean.

Perhaps I am not intelligent enough for this story, but whatever the reason, I've come away with nothing but relief that it is now over. I won't give it 1 star, it is not a bad novel. The characters were varied and developed, the writing was sophisticated... but the story was just boring. Drab. Dull. I have mixed feelings about zombie novels; zombies themselves don't interest or scare me so there has to be something more to the story - this wasn't a problem. In fact, the book wasn't largely dedicated to flesh-eating and zombie moans, it was dedicated to something which I am very interested in and should have been what sold the book to me: politics. I am a self-confessed politics nerd, I have been for a long time - probably ever since I was eleven reading Orwell's 1984 and discovering for the first time how politics could be used to create one hell of a fictional story. I was delighted when I read that the novel was more political than anything else. Ah, well, it wasn't what I expected. In fact, this novel is one very long, drawn-out presidential campaign that made me want to tear my hair out with boredom. I am very surprised that I finished the book at all. I think I was waiting for a great pivotal change to occur about half way through - I've read several reviews saying that the pace picks up in the second half. I would say it does... marginally . I think other members obviously found a greater difference between the first and second halves that I didn't pick up on. It's difficult to say a novel is 'slow' to get going when I never really thought it did. Get going, that is. I found Feed to be a novel that was too long, too dull and too concerned with technical mumbo-jumbo. I'm not a genius but I'm no idiot either and I can't believe that I could be the only one thinking \"what on earth?\" at all the medical lingo and weird descriptions of things that I'd never heard of. I like books that can be educational as well as fictional but if I don't know what the author's talking about I can't take anything away from the experience. By about page 300 of this book, I would look at it on my desk and want to groan at the thought of picking it up again. I cannot imagine there would ever be any desire in me to pick up Deadline . ...more This book broke my heart. Twice. Today I have a headache and puffy bags under my eyes. But it was worth it.

Temple is the only constant \u2013 you live and you die with her. Reading the first half of Feed felt very much like watching a documentary. This is a book about politics, about the clash of generations, about a world that is terrified. It\u2019s about standing up for your beliefs, choosing your priorities and knowing who to trust. It\u2019s about friendship, convictions and brotherly love. It is the year 2039. and the world after the Rising is a very different place. Siblings Georgia and Shaun Mason and their friend Georgette \"Buffy\" Meissonier are journalists. The three of them run their own news blog. They are the first bloggers ever to be allowed full access to a presidential candidate and they intend to make the most of it. They have George to lead and be as objective as possible, they have Shaun using his people skills to open the doors for them, and, thanks to Buffy and her technology, they have eyes and ears everywhere \u2013 which can be both good and very dangerous. Their ratings are suddenly going up and their credibility is as strong as ever (which is all George really cares about). But politics is a dirty business and before they know it, they find themselves in a world of trouble. If I would have to choose a single word to describe each of them, Georgia would be truth, Shaun would be adventure, and Buffy would be emotion. All three of them are weird in their own way, but they are also amazing persons. It is with great joy that I report that the youth of America aren\u2019t actually riddled with ennui and apathy; that the truth hasn\u2019t been fully forsaken for the merely entertaining; that there\u2019s a place in this world for reporting the facts as accurately and concisely as possible and allowing people to draw their own conclusions. I\u2019ve never been more proud of finding a place where I can belong. There is no romance in Feed. Georgia and Shaun don\u2019t date. In fact, George doesn\u2019t even touch people other than her brother. But there\u2019s heart in every sentence and there are emotions too big for words. Seanan McGuire did extensive research for this book - it involved doctors, epidemiologists, technicians and people who were willing to try some of the stunts she described. That\u2019s just one of the things that make this book amazing. Feed has been nominated for the Hugo Award, and it's definitely a well deserved nomination. I'll keep my fingers crossed. Apparently, it already won the Goodreads Choice Award for Science Fiction in 2010. That too was well deserved. The second book, Deadline, was released on May 31st 2011. The third book, Blackout is expected in May of 2012. ...more Ok, I really got to stop adding things to my review.. but just this last time..

Update- 5/23/11- I did say I would pre-order the next book, and I did. Even though I have a Kindle and can get the book the same day I order it, I actually pre-ordered book 2 for my Kindle. Yes, I know I am a dork but I do love this book THAT much! I'm not very good at writing reviews. Why? Because I don't like big words, suck at grammar, and frankly, I just want everyone to trust me when I say \"read the book\" without explanation. Nevertheless, I know that I must put forth more effort than begging you to read this book. Mira Grant aka Seanan McGuire created a world that sucked me in every minute I was reading it. I thought the beginning of the book was long, and boring. But without it, the last 400 pages would have not been what it was, a truly magnificant book! I can't stop thinking about this book. Everything that happened, George and Shuan, and their relationship, the ending (you'll either love it or hate it), the politics, the action, oh yeah, and the Zombies. Will I read the next book ? I, without a shadow of doubt, will hit the pre-order button as soon as the second book becomes available! Update- my copy is circulating among my co-workers, I liked this book so much, I just bought another copy! The only other time I've ever done that was with the Fever series- Karen Marie Moning! Another Update- I've placed this book on my \"favorite book of 2010\" shelf. ...more The short of it is I had a like/hate relationship with this novel.

The dueling candidates were broad brush stereotypes (including a head scratching--to be kind--choice to represent the only female politician in the book as a breast-enhanced bubble head) and the political generalities failed as satire (if that was indeed the intent), and they failed at insight. Politics plays a huge role in this novel, and for 2040 USA, I wanted more than good-guy/bad-guy politicians and social/cultural homogeneity. The Ugly: Too many times the cliched dialogue read like a bad imitation of Army of Darkness Bruce Campbell. Ultimately, I was entertained, if not consistently frustrated with the novel. ...more Final rating: 5/5 stars Final rating - for the whole series: 5/5 stars Sooooo....ever heard of Zombie reporters?

It is one of the rare books where you actually have two siblings for main characters who aren't blood related at all. I usually find many books with a whiny female who is sad about her life, she is boring or she is just so idiotic. This isn't the case, here we have strong main characters Shaun and George (Georgia), who are bloggers after the world officially ended 2014. \u201cI think you kids are totally insane. Entertaining as all heck, and I love your site, but insane.\u201d They are also not teenagers, going by their years, because: they were born 2017, and going by the events of the books, the range of years is between 2039-2041. So that makes the two of them 22-24 years (since they were both the same age). Finally, someone older than 15!!! I guess it's official stereotype to be teen between 15-17. This is a book about zombies, but not about zombies. The zombies are only around, but never the main center of the story (like: a girl is in love with a zombie, or other way around-face it, it's just to sick). It's more about the people in post apocalyptic world. What i really loved though is the fact that the zombie virus was explained properly. For that i recommend reading Countdown after FEED. \u201cMy father has always had just one piece of advice about zombies and ammunition, one he\u2019s drilled into my head enough times that it\u2019s managed to stick: When you have one bullet left and there\u2019s no visible way out of the shit you\u2019re standing in, save it for yourself. It\u2019s better than the alternative.\u201d FEED is split in 5 parts. The first two part of the book were boring ,actually, that goes for second because first one was actually interesting with some little action and interesting lines such as: \u201cOur story opens where countless stories have ended in the last twenty-six years: with an idiot -- in this case, my brother, Shaun -- deciding it would be a good idea to go out and poke a zombie with a stick to see what happens.\u201d And the first two parts focused a lot on politics and senator's campaign. It is important after, and i had to survive through it.Anyway, ALL OF THE OTHER PARTS of the book were AMAZING. especially after the second part of the book when they went on the field to search for evidences on the Senator's farm. That's where things go really cool. After all, this is a story about perusing the truth, because no one deserves to live in a lie, however nice it sounded. \u201cThe difference between the truth and a lie is that both of them can hurt, but only one will take the time to heal you afterward.\u201d At the end, we have mind blowing turn of events. I certainly didn't expect that something like that would happen. Still, it was really shocking so....hm.... Well, it could have ended far more worse as seen in Fed , so i was satisfied with ending. (for those who read it, who didn't cry at this part is unemotional-HUGE SPOILER BELLOW(MEGA SIZE)) (view spoiler) [I was really sad when Shaun had to kill Georgia so she wouldn't turn into a zombie.

I'll admit I have some prejudices that pushed me to that assessment: 1) I really hate it when I can hear an author's opinions or point of view coming out of the mouths of his or her characters; Ian Malcom in Jurassic Park , Laszlo Kreizler in The Alienist , etc. Laszlo even *looks* like Caleb Carr. I know that authors almost always use their characters to channel some of the authors own thoughts and opinions, but I read this for the Apocalypse Whenever book group and ended up not liking it at all.

I know that authors almost always use their characters to channel some of the authors own thoughts and opinions, but when the writer uses the character as a direct mouthpiece it just looks amateurish and vain. Grant does this so blatantly that I feel I can comfortably assume she is a single, geeky, female who doesn't get along with her parents but still lives with them, drinks lots of Coke, has frequent migraines, loves cats, has given up on sex, and wishes she could wear sunglasses all the time without looking odd. No offense meant to geeks - I'm one too. 2) I'd also assume that she writes and/or reads a lot of fanfic. That was the very first impression I had when I started reading this book and 500 pages later it hadn't changed. Again, no offense meant to those who enjoy reading or writing fanfic - if you like it, go for it - but I personally don't care for the stuff. It's almost always bush league (if that), written for a niche audience, and full of errors in style and editing. This book strikes me as the product of a fanfic writer who learned to structure a novel well enough to be published. 3) Plenty of style and editing errors show through, though. It was bad enough that half way through the novel I started dog-earing pages so I could return to reference. The characters of Governor Tate and presidential candidate Ryman are so one-dimensional as to be completely unbelievable. She may as well have had Tate throttling kittens and Ryman running a baby dolphin rescue organization (hint: one of those examples is not my invention). I'm not racking my brain over it but I really can't think of an instance where I've encountered two flatter characters. 4) She should fire Matt Branstad, \"who was responsible for verifying the accuracy of my firearms design...\" A lot of zombie fiction fans are also interested in survivalism and are gun enthusiasts, and when it came to weapon technology the details were only superficially touched upon. The computer technology details, on the other hand (which make up a large part of the book) seemed to be top notch, believable, and well researched. Of course I have no first-hand knowledge of that kind of stuff so I have no idea if it's accurate or not. 5) Tons of lame self-aggrandizing statements like, \"He was a journalist after all and we're all incurably insane.\" *EYEROLL* 6) She has a strange preoccupation with handshakes, describing three different characters as having handshakes that are strong but not too strong. (pg 81, 235, 399) 7) She describes a VW Thing as having airbags which they were not built with. I suppose one could have been retrofitted but there's no mention of that detail. Furthermore, you can't be pinned by an airbag. Anyways I'm starting to sound like I'm piling on. Despite being a big fan of zombie stories I won't be picking up the sequels in this trilogy. eta: I'd logged around 400 books on Goodreads before creating the \"waste-of-paper\" shelf, just for this book. ...more \"The zombies are here, and they\u2019re not going away, but they\u2019re not the story.

Filled with political intrigue, conspiracies, and a long, tedious political campaign -- amidst a zombie-filled post apocalypse world, of course -- Feed is intelligent, it's intense, and though some may find the first half a little long winded, it's completely worth it! A few things I learned once I started reading is 1) this is not a young adult novel; and 2) it's not about the zombies. The very first thing I noticed going into this book was the exquisiteness of the writing. The narration being notably mature and quick-witted makes it an exceptionally smart novel that is just a breath of fresh air. I felt intelligent just by reading Mira's words. This fantastic prose comes together with outstanding world building and amazing characters that become so real you can't help but get emotionally invested. Mira proves, via generous scientific details and infinite facts, that she has done her research through and through, bringing about a world filled with science and technology that turns this zombie apocalypse into a real threat with push beneath it, making it plausible and indefinitely scary. As it's a more technical and political novel especially during the first half, this \"info-dumping\" -- for lack of a better term -- could be a bit dry for some tastes; however, as someone who loves to absorb all this geeky information that essentially makes it one of the most realistic zombie novel I've ever read, I was kept thoroughly engaged in it from the start. Howbeit, I wasn't disappointed when we hit that half way mark and the shit hit the fan! Because once the ball starts rolling on this one, it rolls non-stop until we arrive at one of the the most shocking endings I've read, making me idolize Mira for this daring conclusion. Working a political campaign that turns deadly, the team of bloggers (aka news media) selected to travel with a candidate find themselves in the midst of it all. The leader of this group, Georgia, is our resourceful protagonist who can slap someone silly with her indestructible retorts, and shimmy her way into finding out any and all answers. She wants justice, and she's determined to get it! I loved every single thing about this girl. She has such vibrancy no matter if she's dealing with the campaign, her relationship with her adoptive brother, or writing her blog posts. Her voice oozes out this aptitude that makes her a warrior through and through. Her adoptive brother and best friend, Shaun, is also an incredible character who has the more silly, down to earth side of the coin that will make you chuckle, but he also shows his multi-layered personality through his blog postings from his perspective that we get at the end of several chapters. Working with this duo is a whole team of bloggers that -- even those we only glimpse at regularly -- all become strong players in this dangerous game. In the end, as the quote at the beginning states, it's not really about the zombies, it's a political thriller set in a post apocalyptic future where zombies run rampant. Still, the zombies do heighten the intensity of the plot, making is constantly exhilarating as you never ever feel safe. There are a million ways to die in a zombie novel, and this one is no exception. It's all just sort of unbelievably amazing. -- For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads ...more Please, please don\u2019t let the z-word turn you away from this book.

But the truth is, the zombies are merely the stimulus behind the really scary stuff in this book: human complacency and fear, the mass marketing of lies, and the biggest freak show of them all \u2013 the republican primary. Replace the zombies with water shortages, global warming, terrorism, or any of a host of other frightening topics and this world becomes chillingly close to our own. This story takes place in the not so distant future, where a mutated combination of a cancer cure and a common cold cure has spread to create hordes of the living dead. Disaffected by the mass media\u2019s early attempts to downplay and cover up the outbreak, many have turned to the bloggers to find the real truth. In this world, bloggers aren\u2019t just posting weepy break up poetry or ranting about the latest movie casting decision; they\u2019re carrying weapons, entering infected zones, and digging up the truth at all costs. Georgia is a \u201cNewsie\u201d \u2013 dedicated to finding and reporting the truth objectively. Her adopted brother Shaun is an \u201cIrwin\u201d (RIP Steve-o!) \u2013 always on the hunt for his next adrenaline ride through a zombie infested area. Buffy, the petite blonde fiction writer (\u201cFictional\u201d) and gadget whiz, rounds out the team. Georgia and Shaun have been raised under the bright lights of media scrutiny, as their celebrity parents search for their next ratings boost, and have developed a near symbiotic relationship as a result. When the team is called to follow the campaign of Senator Peter Ryman (who is like a cross between Bill Clinton and John McCain, before he became an embittered old coot), their ratings begin to soar\u2026especially when someone starts making attempts on the Senator\u2019s life. These days I tend to get extremely wearied by the state of journalism. Whenever I catch the news (typically only when I am forced to), it feels like so much fear mongering, propaganda spreading flatulence. I feel like the people that are reporting the real, unbiased stories are either a) working for small newspapers or b) working for independent outfits like ProPublica, and either way, no one is paying attention. This book made me excited about journalism again. I think that she found the perfect balance with George and Shaun, who walk the line between journalistic integrity and wolfish ratings boosting tactics. They bring to mind the best of the hero reporters, who may have been a bit devious, but always got the truth and gave it freely to the public. This book has elements of horror, hard sci-fi, political satire, conspiracy, and it even takes a quick turn into whodunit territory (I'll take Colonel Mustard in the gore soaked barn with a zombie pony...). It kept my brain fully engaged, my butt at the edge of my seat, and my heart completely invested in the characters (which is dangerous in such a fatal environment). Yes, I could see the deaths coming a mile away, but my heart still cracked with each one. I can tell that Mira Grant really did some research on virology. The one or two times that the overly logical part of my brain would have a little niggling doubt about some technical detail, the rest of my brain, heavily involved with the story, would tell it to just shut the hell up. I was well and truly hooked to this story, and boy, does she know how to build suspense! I swear, I practically gnawed off my own hand every time they took one of those virus detection tests. I can\u2019t wait to read Deadline! Perfect Musical Pairing Pearl Jam \u2013 The End I had other, more serious songs picked out for this book\u2026songs about the media, or cut-throat politics. But then I got to the ending, and now I just want to curl up and listen to really sad songs so I can cry. I listened to this right after a certain scene, and got all weepy, especially at this part: \u201dHelp me see myself, Cuz I can no longer tell, Looking up from inside of the bottom of a well, it's Hell, I yell, but no one hears before, I disappear, whisper in my ear. Give me something to echo in my unknown future, you see, my dear, the end, comes near, I'm here, but not much longer.\u201d ...more You live, you die, and then you come back to life, get up, and shamble around trying to eat your former friends and loved ones.

So, I figured it deserved a middle rating for my love/hate relationship with this book. This story is set 20 years after the zombie apocalypse through the eyes of three 20-something bloggers. Blogs are where people get their news now because people have basically had to retreat to living in isolation and fear since the zombies are always a huge threat. Everyone carries the virus that makes them turn into zombies upon death, and there is always the chance that the virus will spontaneously take over and someone will just turn zombie at any time. So, large crowds, or small crowds, are things of the past. It isn't safe to be around a group of people anymore. Our bloggers are Georgia - our main narrator, Shaun - her brother and bff, and Buffy - their friend and colleague. They run a blogging news site and have been picked to follow a presidential candidate as part of his team while he makes the run for office. It is a big opportunity for them to make a name for themselves. We have their adventure told to us through blog entries and Georgia's narration. The thing is, we get a LOT of info-dumping. We learn extensively how the virus of zombism came to be, how it works, and statistics like crazy, and then we learn more about journalism than I've ever wanted to know. On top of that, since they are following a presidential candidate around, we also get tons of political talk. I just found all of that really boring. Really boring.... I almost DNFed the book a couple of times because of it. But, I didn't DNF because of the relationship between Georgia and Shaun - the brother and sister. They had the sweetest sibling relationship that I have ever read in a book. Often, in books, we get sisters who are super close, or brothers, and often twins, but we rarely get a brother/sister relationship that is as close as same sex siblings. And, since I had such an amazingly close relationship with my own brother, it was awesome to read about one. My brother and I were best friends, and sometimes people acted like that was weird, but it was awesome to have that. As I have mentioned before, he died a couple of years ago of AIDS, and I was the one who inherited everything he had. It was bittersweet to find a necklace that had an angel stamped into it with my name on it that he carried around as a good-luck charm, but that was how we felt about each other. I felt like the relationship between Georgia and Shaun captured the closeness, protectiveness, and friendship that siblings can have. And, I really related to them - Georgia, negative and practical, and Shaun, gregarious and protective. I remember when we were little and moved to a new home and my brother went up to some girls my age and asked them if they would be my new friends. ;-) And, I was the one who took him to his doctor's appointments when he was at his sickest. Georgia: Maybe it's geeky for a girl my age to admit she still loves her brother. I don't care. I love him, and one day I'll bury him, and until then, I'm going to be grateful that I'm allowed to watch him talk. So, this relationship made this book for me. It was special.... and then.... let the crying begin... (view spoiler) [Shaun: Sometimes, I was able to forget she wasn't there anymore. For minutes at a time, even, it seemed like the world was the way it was supposed to be. Omg! That description of grief hits hard in the feels because it is so true. I also just lost my dad a few months ago and it tilts the world. Those moments when you, for a minute, think the person is just a phone call away and they are still there... And, then that moment that hits when you remember that they aren't there anymore. Ouch!

After reading it, I agree it deserves its reputation. Look at the synopsis, and you may think: zombie. In reality its a book where the zombies hover in the background of a character-rich mystery. I forgot about the zombies half the time, because it's not a horror book about zombies; it's a drama/thriller with zombies in the world. Not violent, you don't get many descriptions of the walking dead or graphic death scenes. A lot of it is heard about after the fact when relayed to the reader, and most of the deaths aren't actually zombie based, but zombie-virus tainted. If you're a gore reader picking this up expecting plenty of the red stuff and unrelenting terror, you won't be satisfied with those elements. If you're looking for a steadily paced and intriguing story, you'll be content. The story is about a brother and sister following a political candidate who is set to become the new President, but they have to fight assassins and political trickery along the way. The culprit wasn't a surprise unfortunately, but there was a betrayal I didn't see coming, and a totally surprising death. Grant didn't hold the punches with the tragedy, and her writing style made the story flow smoothly. It's not a perfect book - there are some slightly lagging parts and minor bugs, but just the enjoyment level alone was good enough for the five star rating. The book would have worked even better a little trimmed and sped up, but I still sunk into the character's mind as she pondered the fate of the world and chased truth across country. Adding in the weird background of her parents and their media frenzy gave a genuine feel to the backstory of the media influencing this world. The book is broken into editorials and pieces from the news cast; I skimmed a couple of them, but a few made me think. Zombie-lite but intriguing story. ...more a zombie apocalypse so well written it could be real. A gripping, suspenseful read with lots of heart. Feed is by no means a perfect book.

The relationship between Georgia and Shane borders on destructive and is \u2013 let\u2019s face it \u2013 a little weird. (view spoiler) [The cat dies!! (hide spoiler) ] Yet, despite its flaws, I loved this book. Not quite enough to give it five stars, but definitely enough to look very much forward to reading Deadline (which arrived today from Amazon) and to be more than a little devastated by the ending Mira Grant left us with. I shed a few tears. (view spoiler) [I am still pissed the cat died. (hide spoiler) ] If Deadline has one of those evil cliff hangers (I suspect it does), I will be cursing myself for not having waited until the third book in the trilogy was available. I\u2019m finding it hard to recommend Feed to a certain type of reader \u2013 probably because my experience with political thrillers/zombie books is rather limited. But I have to say that for me; this book was a welcome change from all the YA I\u2019ve been reading lately. It has definitely inspired me become a more versatile reader again. I feel like I\u2019ve been neglecting everything non-YA in the last two years. I used to love psychological thrillers, crime novels and epic fantasy when I was younger, but have practically been ignoring those genres for quite some time now. Anyways, to stop rambling: Despite the technical approach this book takes \u2013 all the talk about blogging, viruses mutating, blood testing, weapons \u2026\u2013 it still has lots of heart. Georgia is a very down-to-earth heroine, her narration is far from emotional, but yet, you can always feel her deep love for her brother and the respect she has for her colleagues and friends. She is always observing, always looking for the truth, and terribly honest herself. She has principles and she stands by them no matter what. The banter between her and Shaun is just priceless, but the tender moments were what made me tear up a little. Their brother-sister connection is definitely unique (view spoiler) [and I\u2019m finding it really hard to imagine how the next book will work without it. Georgia and Shaun were so close it is impossible for me to believe that he will be able to cope with her death and move on. (hide spoiler) ] All in all, I think you might like this book if \u2026 (no liability assumed ;)) ~ you are interested in the way the media influences our lives on one side, but also how journalist live and work on the other. ~ you want to know what a sickness can do to our society, how it can make people hole up and hide, how it can take away nearly all of your personal freedoms. ~ you are interested in politics and in the way they shape our society, especially in exceptional situations and danger. ~ you are a fan of conspiracy theories. ~ you don\u2019t mind a lot of technical/medical talk you don\u2019t necessarily understand. ~ you can take a certain amount of gore and violence. ~ you are not looking for the classical let\u2019s-go-out-and-kill-some-zombies adventure. ~ you can live with an absence of romance and swooning ;). But, if you are a cat fan like me, a small warning: Don\u2019t get too attached to the cat. It will only bring you misery. ...more Initial Thoughts I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t actually read this last page BECAUSE OF THE TEARS.

It is about so much more and it\u2019s a shame that this book is being described as a \u2018zombie book\u2019 because there is like a million other things that go on as well. Great depiction of siblings\u2026 very realistic but also hilarious and poignant *sob*. The setting- so much thought has gone into this and the back story is amazing. Also\u2026 LOVE the fact that variations of George (Romero) are the popular names of the time because that would actually happen. News and journalism- what a fascinating speculation of the future of the news and the rise of the importance blogs\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure Ms Grant saw into the future with that one. Hopefully not about the evil Rising and gnashing zombies though\u2026 TENSION. Man, this book was tense I practically have no nails left. Red light green light red light green light red\u2026 ARGH. Subtle but effective writing that feeds (sorry\u2026 couldn\u2019t think of a better word) little clue snippets into the dialogue so you\u2019re left guessing write up until the end. And speaking of the end\u2026in the great words of Bony M\u2026. oh ma looooord. This book was totally not what I was expecting and it always left me guessing. I don\u2019t mean to sound big headed, but I quite often predict what is going to happen in things\u2026not because they are necessarily flimsy plots, but because I\u2019ve watched a lot of television and read a lot of books. So even though I had some pretty major quibbles with this book, I loved this book so much, not only for having an interesting story, exploring fascinating concepts and ideas but for proving that actually, Jo\u2026 you\u2019re not as smart as you think. Because damn, I did NOT expect this book to go the way it did. Flabbergasted. Low points. This book really started off sooooo slow and it took quite a while for things to happen. There was also a lot of politics and even though it was interesting to get the back story and why what was happening was happening, I found it to be unnecessarily in depth and it became quite repetitive. I understand that it was important for the reader to get understand the big ideas (especially when you read Deadline, the second book of the trilogy)\u2026 but it did become a bit tedious. The blogging/technical side of things. Gosh there was a lot of technical jargon in this book (which is probably a high point for a lot of people, but I am a geek but not a computer geek) and a lot of it went over my head. This is probably my fault for my eyes glazing over whenever big bro tried to explain computer things to me\u2026 but about 60% of this was lost on my poor English Literature/Film Studying brain. I loved Georgia as a character- she is intelligent, resourceful, dedicated to her profession and the search for truth and she\u2019s caring but she\u2019s not a simpering girly girl, which was great because I don\u2019t think I could have handled romangst in this book. BUT\u2026 I really didn\u2019t like her as a narrator. I like to connect with my narrators and I\u2019m not saying George was heartless or anything, but\u2026 I think the only thing I had in common with her is how I take my caffeine: Cold. Heroine/Hero/ Best friend. I briefly mentioned George in the low points section\u2026 so I won\u2019t go on too much about her. I\u2019ll focus on my positive feelings towards her. I thought she was such an original character\u2026 a girl who runs a blog documenting the world post- zombie rising, who surpasses all the boys with her mad computer skills and can kill zombies? YES PLEASE. And also, she\u2019s a writer looking for the truth. Aren\u2019t we all, George? Aren\u2019t we all? What I loved about her was that even though George is a complete tom boy and perhaps the furthest away from loving material things as you can get (except for the hair dye, of course!)\u2026 she wasn\u2019t really aggressive with it. She is different than all the other girls but she accepts this and just gets on with it and gets on with her job. I\u2019m so glad that Grant wasn\u2019t like \u2018LOOK HOW ORIGINAL THIS TOMBOY CHARACTER WHO DOESN\u2019T LIKE FASHIONABLE CLOTHES AND DOESN\u2019T UNDERSTAND BOYS IS\u2019 all the time, because in a lot of dystopian novels (*cough* Mockingjay *cough*) this happens and it\u2019s so off-putting and amazing characters (*cough* Mockingjay *cough*) are ruined by this. Even though I didn\u2019t have much in common with George and didn\u2019t relate to her as much as I have narrators in other books I\u2019ve read\u2026 I appreciated that it was her telling the story because in hindsight (which, of course, is 20:20) I don\u2019t think this book would have worked if it hadn\u2019t been told from how she saw it from behind her aviators. Which leads me nicely to Shaun (and yes, I immediately thought of this and this ) but no offense to Simon Pegg, who does have some kind of nerdy British charm and an understandable fondness for Cornettos\u2026 this Shaun was muuuuuuch cuter and yes, I have a crush on him. He is George\u2019s brother, co-worker and best friend. But unlike George, he's kinda glad there are zombies everywhere because his job is to go into the field and report on the zombies from up-close. And, of course, poke them with sticks. Shaun is such a great character: he\u2019s hilarious, he\u2019s stupid, he\u2019s a typical boy, he's dangerous, he walks around in his underwear (BOOM.), he\u2019s reckless but he has such a good heart and he's so honorable and just a massive cutie in cargo pants. I also love the relationship between George and Shaun, it\u2019s such an interesting dynamic because normally with sibling relationships in books it seems so forced and \u2018Ohh my brother/sister is soo annoying\u2019. But G & S really care for each other, they rib each other but they seem to slot perfectly together, their relationship was my favourite part of this book. Sigh. Baddie. Ignoring the fact that the flesh-eating zombies are kinda baddies\u2026 I was a little disappointed with the main, main baddie. I like my evil characters with a bit of mystery and intrigue but this one seemed to just stroll up on the page and be like \u2018HI JO, I\u2019M EVIL AND I\u2019M GOING TO CAUSE PROBLEMS. MUHAHAHA\u2019 as he twiddled his moustache. BUT BUT\u2026 I\u2019m writing this book after I read Deadline and like I said about hindsight being great, even though the baddie in Feed wasn't the best\u2026Grant did an amazing job at setting up the baddies for book numero deux. The bigger picture \u2018n\u2019 all. Theme Tune. They Are Night Zombies!- Sufjan Stevens. I was going to choose a very literal song for this book\u2026 but I decided against it when I found this gem by Sufjan Stevens. When I first saw the title, I was expecting it to be a funny song and then was surprised at the sense of melancholy, the lack of permanence and the poignancy that it evoked. Like how I felt with this book, when my preconceptions were challenged. The song is all about the resurrection and how the mistakes of the past can shape the future which makes it particularly relevant to the message of the book. Also\u2026 it has possibly the best title ever. (The full title is \u201cThey are Night Zombies! They are Neighbours! They Have Come Back from the Dead! Aaaah\u201d) Angst Level. 10/10. GOD. This book. I finished this book a few days ago but I literally couldn\u2019t bring myself to write about it because the ending shocked me and affected me so much. I keep thinking about it and nearly drown in the emotion that it brings. There are a lot of deaths in this book, some are pretty obvious and easily to predict, but they are dealt with such raw emotion that even though you may have guessed it was coming, you still feel your heart ripped out and mourn with the characters.

Yes, at some point it got to be a bit slow, but it was still full of useful information and there was still way too much to enjoy so I never got bored. What did I expect? Ahh.. zombies?! Duh! I mean I am not a zombie fan, not at all, but this book was highly recommended to me so I said \" What the hell, I am reading it, and I'm sure I'm gonna love it! \" What did I get? A lot more than that. Because this story is not really about zombies, you know? It's like saying that a book is about trees only because some scenes involve the main characters having fun in the park.. The trees are there, right, but the story is not really about them (ok, so maybe this is not such a good comparison because you don't see many trees trying to kill you in any story whatsoever, but you get my point). Same here.. There are zombies, and there is this virus transforming people into zombies when they die or get bitten/infected, but the story is more about these 3 characters - Georgia, Shaun, Buffy - and their blogging passion and their need to find the truth (all kind of truths). The 3 of them were friends, working together in a blog network, and they were so happy to get involved in the greatest adventure of their life, being selected in the position of \"pet bloggers\" for Senator Ryman's presidential campaign. What they never knew was how many dangers awaited for them. Georgia Mason - smart, and honest with herself and the world. She lived for the truth, she lived for the news, and she was pretty good at it. I like how she cared about her brother, Shaun, how she was always there to 'rescue' him when he was playing with the dead, and their adventures were awesome starting with the very first one. \"Our story opens where countless stories have ended in the last 26 years: with an idiot, in this case my brother Shaun, deciding it would be a good idea to go out and poke a zombie with a stick to see what happens\" Shaun Mason on the other hand was a bit childish, but he was also so damn cute, smart and caring, with a passion for danger and for 'poking zombies with a stick '. I loved his relation with his sister because they knew each other so well, and their conversations were refreshing and funny as they kept joking around even in the hardest of the times. Their close relationship was all they both had,\u00a0being\u00a0raised by their adoptive parents that only cared about ratings and numbers, it always have been them vs. the world.. but then the world really turned\u00a0against\u00a0them, didn't it? This was by far the best duo I've read about in a while and they also made me want to cry (oh, don't you EVER make me cry again, do you hear me?!!!). There was this carousel of emotions (with the highs heavenly high and the lows so damn low) that left me feeling like I've been spinning around, and around, and around and.. I didn't see it coming, no I didn't. And you know how you feel when you stop spinning around? You feel lost and confused, you need something to hold on to, and the only thing I know I can hold on to is the sequel, and I need to read it, because I simply need to know what happens next. Buffy well, it's hard to talk about her\u00a0because she was mostly kept into the shadow. She was the one handling all the technological part - image, sound, servers, security - it was all Buffy's work. I understood when she needed someone next to her, and I cared for her when she was afraid, but I wish I could have known her better. I\u00a0don't\u00a0want to spoil her relationship with the other 2 and her role into the story, so I'll leave it at this: she did surprise me.. a lot. \"She listened to all kinds of music, even the stuff that sounds like static and church bells. She played guitar really badly, but she meant every note.\" Now, the part that I didn't like that much, was the one involving politics.. that part was so hard to get through. Of course, it was there to deliver more information about the settling, about the world, about how things worked.. not to mention that it was crucial into the story, with the 3 bloggers following the senator in his campaign, but at some point there was just too much settling and too little action and\u00a0it made me yawn a bit and I put the book down a few times. There would be some more things I loved or hated, but no, I can't talk about them because they are all spoilers. But I loved the characters, the story, the writing is great too, so if you want to try it I don't think you could possibly be disappointed. Really, you'll like it (even love it) :) ...

It\u2019s like I\u2019m working twenty-four seven in the outside world without knowing that I\u2019m lying on my bed without doing something, idle for hours and it\u2019s becoming my favourite habit.

Two weeks full of shit like those scared people influenced under the fear of becoming one of the undead. And I\u2019m sure if the Rising is real, I could be like one of them. I mean them, those people who hid from the darkness of fear. Feed , written by Seanan McGuire under her pen name Mira Grant , is the first instalment of Newsflesh Trilogy and published widely by Orbit Books. The novel tells the story of a group of young bloggers, accepted to document a political official in his quest to enter White House. The book was narrated by one of the Mason\u2019s siblings, Georgia Mason , a Newsie and an Alpha blogger. As the story goes deeply into the mind of Georgia , conspiracies become visible that driven the American political world into a nightmare of the mankind. Zombies are popping around the streets, friends are traitors, enemies are hiding and most of all, there are secrets that are meant to share. Did Georgia and Shaun survive in the war between the good and the evil? It\u2019s a matter of faith and let Georgia finish her story. Feed is one of my most challenging books to read. It has something to do with politics which my brain cannot constantly digest every word Senators and Governors are talking about. All I could read are praises that soon to be mischiefs of men inside and outside the book. Maybe this is how politics works in reality; they are the sophist; they have the tongue of snakes; they can visibly seduce anyone; they can hide their true skin. This book could be condemned by the government if they wanted it so if zombies were real or maybe if you are living in a country where politics is a very sensitive issue. Fortunately, the whole zombie bonanza and bullet proof vests were another illusion made by Mira Grant that could be possibly real in the near future. Another problem I encountered was the long chapters, the never ending sentences, the infinite words and I called these chapters as Georgia \u2019s very observant mind. I don\u2019t mind reading long chapters if they really not meant to drag you out of your seats. This is another issue, it didn\u2019t drag me out of my seat but it dragged me out of my body. Is this worst or what? Just guess. Some part bored me to death that I never dared to continue reading it back again and start another chapter the other day. I don\u2019t like to spoil myself from too many conspiracies that every end of the chapter only gave me very powerful last words but no answers. Well, that\u2019s a positive part of the book. The words were too bold that the book clearly speaks of Mira Grant 's message. Truth must prevail and what Georgia did is a suicide but for the braves, it\u2019s heroism. The first thing that I enjoyed about Mira Grant is the constant giving of punch lines. Yeah, I really mark what I said. It really punches you to the face and I saw another bullseye coming. It speaks of the truth and Georgia is the medium of that truth. If only they gave me time to cover my face, then I should. It\u2019s the awkward moment when you as an outsider to America\u2019s territory can relate to the political situation of the book. It\u2019s a universal rule, politics is the dirtiest job. Who could tell not? So if I were you, you should hide under the roof of your houses and let the brave ones fight for our rights. Wrong. We, I mean we as the victims of lies, must work to change the dirtiest job in the universe. But the one we choose can prevent himself from the pestering seduction of power? That\u2019s another problem. The division of bloggers in the book is quiet unique. I know the so called \u2018division\u2019 are quiet popular lately. For example, in The Hunger Games Trilogy , Suzanne Collins divided the population into fourteen (consider the capitol and the thirteen) districts, each may possess a special skills and product. Another example can be found in Veronica Roth \u2019s bestselling book Divergent . She divided the people into four groups which encompass their skills and futures. And Feed , divided bloggers into many categories. One can be a Newsies, Stewarts, Irwins, Aunties and the Fictionals . The difference is, this divisions are way geeky than the others which can be loved by the literary part of the society. And I mean it this must be loved! The blogging community divided into its current brunches within a few years of the Rising, reacting to swelling ranks and changing society. You\u2019ve got Newsies , who report fact as untainted by opinion as we can manage, and our cousins, the Stewarts , who report opinion informed by facts. The Irwins go out and harass danger to give the relatively housebound general populace a little thrill, while their most sedate counterparts, the Aunties , share stories of their lives, recipes, and other snippets to keep people happy and relaxed. And, of course, the Fictionals , who fill the online world with poetry, stories and fantasy. They have a thousand branches, all with their own names and customs, none of them meaning a damn thing to anyone who isn\u2019t a Fictional. We\u2019re the all-purpose opiate of the new millennium: We report the news, we make the news, and we give you a way to escape when the news becomes too much to handle. Read above and who could dare not to love this book as much as I did. This is the new generation of bloggers that soon to be part of the zombie-apocalypse and the text above is taken from one of Georgia Mason 's blog posts. I hope everyone is safe inside their home and for the extra courage, an oath is shared. An oath for everyone; Georgia Mason is the daughter of the American Revolution. She took the right road. The truth prevails. We must fight for our rights. And believe me, this book could be the start of something new. I\u2019m Sweet Reads and I\u2019m signing off. Those who died, you\u2019ll be missed.

Change is not always bad, and same goes for diversity. This novel took a different take regarding zombies, and honestly it proved more believable than most. It's true that eradication of the population would mean eradication of the plot itself, because what's more to tell if everyone's dead anyway. Mere survival of the characters wouldn't really strike as something mind boggling in my opinion. There must be depth in the plot, something to make you think about the possible consequences. When I reached the middle of the novel I immediately concluded that this is not something that I would like. It's something different and I was really looking for a lot of violence. This novel tackled on issues regarding politics and morality. Not the typical chop the zombie's head off and move to the next safe zone. I'll be honest and say I didn't realize that I was looking for a cheap zombie-apocalpyse themed novel, but my opinion of the novel changed as I read on. Some major political problems were evident here, and also of the journalism field. This' an entertaining and at the same time eye opening novel. A novel can't contain pure entertainment, sometimes you have to look for real world problems to ponder upon. (view spoiler) [ The best and worst part of the novel would be when Georgia got infected. Not only did the author further developed the diversity of the novel, but it made me stop and think if the death was necessary in the first place. Georgia and Shaun were both really iconic, so one death might trigger a revolution. I found her death relevant yet sorrowful. I didn't really expect to feel much for a character's death in this novel, but I realized how much I've learned to love some of them. Buffy's another story. Her death triggered Georgia's dark side. I can say that her death was necessary as compared to Georgia's. (hide spoiler) ] Despite all the really good parts of the novel, I don't think I can rate this 5/5. I really liked the novel as a whole, but it took me more than half of the novel for me to actually really like it. It didn't have that early impact on me, so some parts were actually a drag to read. It's clearly not a perfect novel, but it's different and good. 4.5/5 stars, and all I can say is, don't expect the same zombie themed apocalypse that you're used to. ...more \u201cThe virus is background noise to us\u201d The above quote from the book sums it up pretty nicely.

Honestly, she just comes across as a snide, self important bitch. Georgia tells us that the people she meets are this, that and the other, but their speech and action rarely show them to be any different from one another (Although when an English character shows up at the end, he actually says at one point \"Bloody bizarre.\" Bloody? Really. He also has a blog called \"Fish and Chips.\" I don't remember a mention that he was wearing a bowler hat, but it certainly wouldn't surprise me.) Perhaps the worst offender and best example of this is when we get to chapter 27. I can't say why without giving away heavy spoilers, but it's annoying. Chapter 26 also ends in a major breach of the rules of the format. Not in a clever way. Not in a game changing way. It just doesn't work. The overall plot is all right. It kept me entertained enough to read through to the end, despite other problems. The acknowledgements at the end of the book begin with the sentence \"This is a book that truly could not have been written without the help of a dedicated and industrious team of editors, continuity checkers, and subject experts.\" I wouldn't normally have a problem with that. The thing is, there's a line in the book- \u201cIreland has never had an extradition treaty with the United States. It still doesn't.\u201d According to The Irish Department of Justice and Law Reform , it states \"Countries with which Ireland has Extradition Treaties Ireland currently has bilateral extradition treaties with: * Australia * United States of America.\" It took me maybe ten seconds to find that out, so I'm not sure how industriously the facts were checked in this. Of course, it's possible that Georgia is just plain wrong, but I don't feel like the author would be happy for her to ever be wrong. In all, it's okay. It's not a great book and I certainly can't recommend it as a high point of zombie fiction, but I enjoyed it well enough. ...more This is a zombie novel for the zombie novel neophytes.

But if you want to take the blogging world by storm and pretty much take over the entire universe (as I plan to do at some not-so-distant point in the near future), then this novel is for you and your grandkids and your grandkids\u2019 grandkids. Mira Grant may not know how to write zombie encounters with lyrical prose and wit, but she sure can suck every last bit of flesh off the newsworthy bone. Her powerful prose and attention-to-detail would have the blogging world doing the wave and possibly even executing a well-timed backflip. But the zombies felt about as realistic as Freddy Krueger coming back from the grave. And that\u2019s where this novel failed a bit, during the so-called action sequences that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Statham, and Sylvester Stallone would have laughed at, while flexing their biceps and kissing the stacked heroine with the mile long legs. In fact, I actually set this novel aside, even though the voice captured my attention more readily than a flesh-eating zombie standing six inches from my face, right around the motorcycle flip on page 15 or so. It had a great opening, and then there was the first zombie encounter, and then it fizzled faster than a soda with the top popped standing out in the heat of the New Mexican desert. But I came back to it, and I trudged onward and upward, with my Apple XH-224 test kit, laptop computer, and .40 handgun. And man am I glad I did. With the world building, political aficionados, northern California terrain, beautiful blog entries, and a politician named Kirsten \u201cKnockers\u201d Wagman who needs no further introduction, this novel stands on its own two legs and then proceeds to kick its own ass. Sure, it\u2019s easy to argue the characters were a bit thin at times, and FEED does have more than its share of political mumbo jumbo, fueling the political train that\u2019s headed straight off the cliff, and carrying the last remnants of the Kellis-Amberlee virus along with it. But I actually enjoyed the political bastardization of the entire American nation, and an inside look into partisan politics and radical fat cats and nitwits, where bloggers reign supreme and congressmen and governors bang on the used drum set in the corner. I may just have to carry this trilogy all the way to the end, but I won\u2019t read the synopses for either DEADLINE or BLACKOUT before I do. And if you want to keep your spoiler-free world intact, I\u2019d suggest you do the same. ...more A perfect summer read.

It's a good way to develop interest, but the plot actually focuses on an adopted brother-sister news team, Georgia and Shaun Mason. Their careers take off when they win the chance to follow and blog about a presidential candidate as he campaigns for his party's nomination. I thought Grant did a great job of projecting technology into the future without becoming particularly silly about it (no flying cars here); instead, we have micro-dot cameras, ear-cuff phones and instant video feeds. It's a projection that feels mostly possible--is an ear cuff that different from an ear-clip phone? In fact, that might be my only complaint of future technology: with so much of the country devastated and compressed into tight communities, would there really be instant internet access everywhere? And I do mean everywhere, as the kits that test for zombie virus are immediately uploaded to the CDC, even outside a zombie zone, or on highways in the middle of nowhere. I thought the main characters, Georgia and Shaun Mason were developed well (quibble--I found his name quite distracting: 'Shaun?' Really? \"Shaun of the Dead\"?? but maybe \"Buffy\" was as well for those raised on \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\") I loved Georgia, her tone, her \"don't-touch-me\" interactions, her smart strategy in growing their news-site, her willingness to have ethical code govern her practices. The political people were cardboard cutouts, but thankfully we don't spend overmuch time with them. The parents were actually quite interesting in their weirdly dysfunctional relationship with their adoptive children and their survival mentality. The tech was largely well thought out, with zombie kits that report to the government, even if the seal is broken and not used, and virus testers built into \"safe\" vehicles. I imagine that Grant hit possible response to a worldwide disaster spot on--the attempt to cure, the consolidation of resources, the short term strategies. She even thought of the impact zombification would have on autopsies and forensics--now that's a well thought-out system. I'd disagree with other reviewers who feel the story has an incest angle (view spoiler) [ at least, for this book. (hide spoiler) ] , if that's the only part preventing reading. Grant does an admirable job of developing an extremely close relationship between the brother and sister. After finishing, my sense was of an unusually close relationship developed by adversity and coping strategies, but not an inappropriate one. Quick flashbacks and side remarks give us a picture of emotionally distanced parents, so the children connected to the only people they could connect with in a relatively isolated situation (they grow up outside the safest zoned areas). It's apparent that emotional distancing is how Georgia has coped with her upbringing and is how she interfaces with the world. Some people might object to the rather \"emotionless\" tones of the narration, but I feel Grant did well, with a tone that is quite true to Georgia's character. I enjoyed the pace, and the building of suspense as zombie attacks become more and more directed. The villain is a little stereotypical, coming down clearly on the side of people that kick dogs and make small babies cry, but give Grant a break--she added zombies to her political conspiracy. I'm looking forward to the next book. Three stars for keeping me up at night until bleary-eyed. ...more Feed: Brought to you by Coke. Haha, I kid, but only a little. With how much Georgia drinks Coke I couldn't help but think in-book advertising is a new thing. So this book was a rollercoaster for me. I couldn't decide if I liked it or not.

With how much Georgia drinks Coke I couldn't help but think in-book advertising is a new thing. So this book was a rollercoaster for me. I couldn't decide if I liked it or not. I was considering a 3 star rating about halfway through....and then the end came up and swept me away with its craziness and I had to say 4 stars. The first half, this was me: I'm not going to lie, this book takes some commitment. Politics, technology, and journalism aren't most people's thing. Zombies are. For a 600 page book about zombies, the zombies surprisingly take a back seat. They serve as a setting for the story, not the plot of the story itself. Since the story is set about 25 years after zombies have become a normal part of life, they are just another part of the world, albeit a rather dangerous everyday part of life. They shape the world but they serve the story, as opposed to the story serving the zombies. The main plot centers around Georgia and her brother Shaun, along with their techie friend Buffy, running a news site and chasing after a presidential candidate to blog and report along the campaign trail. (doesn't sound like everyone's cup of tea, right?) But here's the thing. The world building is fantastic. In the acknowlegements/interview section at the end, you will see that the author was dedicated to trying out the things she was writing about in real life, firing guns and testing out fight scenes and doing research. You can tell how much that paid off because the world, all the information about how zombies have changed careers, lives, medicine, politics, etc is so well fleshed out. The writing is also very readable and well done. Perhaps I could have done with a bit more environment description, but the narrator Georgia is a very factual person. She's not here for poetry, so it makes sense that she isn't interested in being flowery with the scenery. I found no qualms with the writing style, as I often do with other books, and there were only a couple typos which I would attribute to the editor's/publisher's fault, not the author's. The last third is where it really takes off though, and worth all the sort of politics and the techie babble at the beginning (though even that isn't dense reading in any way, just a bit dry.) I can't really say much because anything I say will spoil, and I don't want to tempt you with spoiler tags, but the zombies and the deaths start to add up as we make it to the climax and I found myself not wanting to put the book down so I could find out what happens as the ending came hurtling toward me. What I also enjoyed is that for a series book, it was pretty conclusive. There is one small tie left unclosed, to give you an idea of what the next book will be about, but almost all other pieces are mended. I think it was a satisfactory ending, though also an emotional one. Me at the end: There were many twists and turns I was not expecting. And I appreciated that, only one of my slated predictions came true out of the many wild guesses I stabbed at. Overall, the wonderful world building, the exciting climax and ending, and the skillful writing earn this book four stars, completely making up for the mildly slow first half. I will be reading the next books! Also beware this book if you love animals ;__; Just saying. ...more I started reading this book with all the wrong expectations: I thought it would be YA and that it would be about zombies. As already stated in endless reviews before mine, zombies do not represent the lion's share in this book. Nor is it YA lit. The year is 2039. Society as we know it has changed profoundly. Due to the combination of two potent \"vaccinations\", one meant to cure colds and the other cancer, a new virus had developed and has affected the whole world population. Side effects? Once you I started reading this book with all the wrong expectations: I thought it would be YA and that it would be about zombies. As already stated in endless reviews before mine, zombies do not represent the lion's share in this book. Nor is it YA lit. The year is 2039. Society as we know it has changed profoundly. Due to the combination of two potent \"vaccinations\", one meant to cure colds and the other cancer, a new virus had developed and has affected the whole world population. Side effects? Once you die, you become a zombie. Georgia and Shaun Mason are bloggers, which in the new society is equal to journalists. When they are chosen as official press to follow the Republican candidate for the presidential campaign, they think they've won the jackpot, the possibility to become popular Alpha bloggers. Except that someone is trying to sabotage the campaign and, as their popularity increases, so do the risks of being involved in a dangerous political intrigue which might be more than what they've bargained for. As I said, this book is not strictly about zombies. To me, it felt more like a legal thriller \u00e0 la John Grisham, except with journalists instead of lawyers. The world-building is very detailed and complicated, both in relation to the insurgence and development of the virus and to the blogging tech details. So much so that this book really made feel like a Neanderthal of computers and tech devices, I felt like I still haven't discovered the wheel. Directly proportionate to the detailed world building, is the infodump. There's a lot of info in this book to digest and I'm not sure I always liked the way the author introduced it. As the story develops, she throws in names and events - especially court cases, laws or names of public people - as if they're taken for granted, letting the characters explain later on the references she made. I have to admit this strategy she used was a bit unnerving. (And by the way, is the Cruise in the Cruise -Gore previous presidential campaign who I think it is?) Also, but probably this was mainly my fault, I thought this book was YA. Automatically, I inferred that my main characters were teenagers. Wrong. They're closer to 25 years old. As I realized this, I was already well into the story and I had a hard time readjusting all my \"visual picturing\" of the action. I think the author should have probably made it clearer from the beginning. Probably, I got tricked by the fact that Georgia and Shaun were still living with their parents, a normal fact for the place where I come from, but maybe not in the US - though post-apocalyptic. Also, Shaun totally acts like a teenager (a 24 year old man acting like a kid? Never heard of one before. Never. I swear). Georgia. Georgia is our main character for about 90% of the book, as the story is told from her POV. And I spent 90% of the book deciding whether I liked her or not. Most of the time she is so badass she turns into an arrogant bitch. She resents her adoptive parents for exploiting them (hate to break it you, Georgia, but there's much, much worse), she is cold but whines in her head. Other times though, she would surprise me with her unconditional loyalty to Shaun (and was it only me who thought their relationship bordered on morbid?) and her moral integrity or she would win me over by citing Shakespeare out of the blue - \"something is rotten in the state of Denmark\" is one of my favorites quotes ever. Reflective of her personality, the tone of the narration is pretty aseptic for a good part of the book. Her character is based on truth, and truth we get, but not much emotion. But don't think that this book will easily make forget itself. As the intrigue unravels, the plot will suddenly turn and punch you in the face unmercifully. The narration will become so intense, you will feel miserable and unable to put down the book. Believe me, I shed some tears and I rarely do. So. I strongly recommend reading this book because I liked it very much and I think that so will you. It's not for everybody. It's not romance. There is not really a HEA. But even if you're not a zombie lover, this book is one of the good ones. The sequel Deadline is already out. Follow my reviews at NightReader ...more", "Title": "Feed"},
