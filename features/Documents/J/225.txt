{"Comments": "<+++>The Damned: Damnation Chronicles: Book One</+++>This tale was strange and yet intriguing. It didn't necessarily pull me in, but it wasn't specifically repelling either - it was just bizarrely brilliant and unlike anything I have read before. I think I might actually read the next book in the series at some point because I'd like to see what happens, regardless of the fact that I can't particularly rant and rave over this story. It was interesting, but it failed to WOW me. it was a strange story both good and not so good at the same time.<---A>Joseph Sweet</---A><---C>Joseph Sweet</---C><+++>The Damned: Damnation Chronicles: Book One</+++>", "Title": "The Damned: Damnation Chronicles: Book One"},
