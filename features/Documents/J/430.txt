MY SHIP HAS SAILED I DESERVE TO SCREAM AND SQUEAL AND DANCE AND HYPERVENTILATE AND FAINT AND ACT LIKE A CHILD THAT JUST MET SANTA!!! *turns off fangirl mode* Ok,I can continue now. \u201cNothing good could possibly come from a plan that involved turning a man into a syphilis incubator.\u201d Yeap that's right,after the flying palace and the rakshasas there is a new, more dangerous threat.The babylonian god of plague and chaos with seven deadly sidekicks decided to use Atlanta as a playground and eliminate competition by attacking the mighty forces of the city.<---C>Kate Daniels</---C> is the only one who can defeat this evil force,but the price is the revelation of her bloodline that might endanger everything she holds dear. \u201cThe rabbis paled. I\u2019d managed to terrify holy men. Maybe I could beat up a nun for an encore.\u201d After 3 books,one would expect that <---A>Ilona Andrews</---A> would have trouble writing a compelling and fresh storyline,but that's far from the truth! <+++>Magic Bleeds</+++> combines action,mystery and romance wrapped up with sarcasm and clever humor and makes falling in love with the story and the characters inevitable!Reading the adventures of Kate Daniels and her furry friends is effortless and utterly enjoyable !I was once again sucked in a complex world full of magic and blood and I still crave more,more battles,more secrets,more sassiness,more ass-kicking,more Curran, more everything ! \u201cHe was mine.He cared for me,he made me lose all sense,he didn't give a damn about my father.He was what I wanted,because he made me happy.I wanted him like I'd never wanted anyone in my life.\u201d Let me tell you this,the relationship between Kate and Curran was a crazy roller-coaster.Every single thing Kate felt,I felt it too.Anger,disappointment,betrayal,heartbreak,longing,happiness,love.She showed a more vulnerable side and I loved her even more for that.Kate and Curran are both arrogant assholes,and it took them some time to solve a terrible misunderstanding,but once they stopped behaving like children,Curran became Kate's own personal psycho and oh boy,it was good! \u201cYou don't pick the family you're born into. You pick the one you make. I already chose my mate and glued her ass to the chair to make sure she knew it.\u201d And OH MY GOD THEIR SCENES WERE HOT HOT HOT HOT !!!They never stopped fighting but that was sexy!!Curran is the most delicious alpha-male ever ,but he could also be a romantic teddy bear that made me giggle and want to hug him!And do some other, bad things with him!

I read all kinds of genres of books, but when I read urban fantasy I get a feeling of being at home. The Ilona Andrews writing team created a universe where when I'm having a bad day or want to have a good time, I can open a paperback, and escape there effortlessly and happily. And that's exactly what I did with this book. I recently had some crap come up in my personal life, and when I had the chance I transported myself into this world of mercenaries and werebeasts and didn't want to come back out. So massive kudos to the authors, you did your job right. In magic flare zone Atlanta, Kate Daniels is stood up. That's right, she cooked the Beast Lord Curran dinner, and he never showed. Flash forward about a month or so and the two are at each others' throats. On top of this, there's a strange shaman who keeps showing up in bars and casinos and trying to magic blast the place with plague and disease. It's not long before Kate gets called onto the case, and when she does she finds she might be more connected to it than she expected. This was the best book of this series for me so far. The plot was thrilling, the banter was witty and humorous, and I couldn't put the darn book down even when my eyelids were slowly closing due to a need for sleep. My favorite part of the book? The pranks Kate and Curran were playing on each other. When she covered his bed in catnip and he glued her ass to her office chair? Priceless. The addition of the attack poodle to Kate's daily life only made the story more entertaining. \"....I think a dog is a great idea. I just never pictured you with a mutant poodle.\u201d \u201cHe isn\u2019t a poodle. He\u2019s a Doberman mix.\" \u201cAha. Keep telling yourself that.\u201d Also, another reason why this book was awesome? It's the hook up book! Yes, the Kate and Curran relationship finally comes to a explosive collision in this book and it was all it was cracked up to be. \"I miss you. I worry about you. I worry something stupid will happen and I won't be there and you'll be gone. I worry we won't ever get a chance and it's driving me out of my skull.\" This was also the book where I finally stopped skimming when it came to the plot. By this I mean the underlying issue or mystery. As much as I love the other books and their stories, there were points when I skimmed. That didn't really happen in this book. All of Kate's investigations had me utterly enthralled, and the parts with Kate and Erra was like watching an interrogation between a smart ass and a sociopath (it would make great television, just saying). And that ending? (view spoiler) [ When they finally got to flip it and Kate took care of Curran when he was injured? Heartwarming. It gave the viewer a small glimpse of what Curran goes through when Kate was injured or sick. (hide spoiler) ] \"You don't pick the family you're born into. You pick the one you make.

It's been too long since I've read Bitten by Kelley Armstrong (best first installment in an UF series ever), to say for sure . . . but it's a close thing, either way. And I love Magic Strikes and Geez, friggin', Louise . . . Just in case you've somehow missed my enthusiasm for Kate #3, Magic Strikes , I'll say (at least) one more time that it is my favorite installment in a UF series ever. And it is. But Magic Bleeds gets 5 stars too. It's maybe my second favorite installment in a UF series ever. It's been too long since I've read Bitten by Kelley Armstrong (best first installment in an UF series ever), to say for sure . . . but it's a close thing, either way. And I love Magic Strikes and Magic Bleeds for similar, yet very different reasons. One of my favorite (and simultaneously LEAST favorite) things about blogging is that it's made me think about why I like or dislike something in a book. Sometimes I miss the simplicity of finishing a book, saying, \"I love it, it RAWKED,\" then moving on to the next thing, but on the whole, I think I get more out of the books I read now. You guys are like one of my upper division college lit classes where everyone WANTS to talk about the book<-----I LOVE it. For example, this is probably the fifth time I've read this book, but it's the first time I've realized that the more one of these books touches on Kate's family history, the more I like it. Same goes for how direct the link between the Bad Guy and that history (Roland) is. In book 3, the Bad Guys were Roland's flunkies. In Magic Bleeds . . . well, I can't tell you who the Bad Guy is, but suffice it to say, NOT a flunkie. And for those of you (like me) who devour every, single speck of Kate-lore, you will be so ridiculously happy with this book. Just after the mid-way point, is History of Roland 101. Back to Bad Guy though, this one is both enthralling and terrifying. Bad Guy is crazy. No really--total psychopath. But at the same time Bad Guy is . . . \" ruthlessly intelligent .\" \"Why call them half-breeds?\" \"It's a convenient term. It drips with contempt. Your're a soldier who faces a monstrosity. It's stronger and faster than you, it looks like a nightmare, and when it takes a wound that would kill a normal man, its fellows push you back and fifteen minutes later the creature you wounded is back on its feet. Where will your courage come from?\" I leaned toward her. \"But if you think the creature is an abomination, a half-breed, who is less than you, you might reach deep inside and find a pair...\" \"Exactly.\" Magic Bleeds is full of these insightful, little life lessons, and for the first time, you begin to understand what Kate is up against. Her enemy is THOUSANDS of years old, with THOUSANDS of years worth of not just knowledge, but application of that knowledge. (view spoiler) [I think the Andrews are particularly clever here when they make Kate an almost mirror image of her aunt. It lends credulity to Kate living through the inevitable showdown with Roland--yes, Kate is infinitely less experienced, but as Erra said, \" Blood ran true ,\" and Kate has proven on numerous occasions that she is adaptable and quick on her feet. (hide spoiler) ] Seriously fantastic villain and history lesson aside, there are a multitude of other reasons to love this book. Most of those reasons can be boiled down to Kate being Kate and Curran being Curran. It's not a spoiler to tell you that Curran doesn't show for the naked dinner, b/c it's the very first thing that happens in this book. Now imagine all the various ways that could play out, and you start to get an idea of the epic awesomeness of this book. (view spoiler) [There is nothing better than an affectionate Curran . . . except for maybe a throwing-you-on-the-floor-to-have-his-way-with-you Curran. But hey, LUCKY you, you don't have to decide, you get them BOTH. Oh yeaaah. (hide spoiler) ] YEP. It's that good. LOVE it.

Magic Bleeds is such an amazing read that by the time I finished the book I wasn\u2019t sure whether I wanted to read it again or jump right to the next one\u2026 I could do this. I just had to stay cool. Zen. No punching in the face. Punching would not be Zen. Well, to be honest, the first part of the book wasn\u2019t that fantastic but the second half simply blew me away. Why? Action, mystery, the usual Kate badassery, lots of emotion, some downright heart-breaking moments and humour, lots of it. A lion roar burst through the phone. I held it away from my ear until he was done. \u201cVery scary. I feel it\u2019s my duty to remind you that threatening a member of law enforcement is punishable by law. If you would like to file a petition regarding your break-in, the Order will gladly look into the matter for you.\u201d The phone fell silent. Oh God, I gave him an aneurysm. In this instalment we get more details about Kate\u2019s blood and lineage (lovely family!) and learn about the Pack rules & regulations in detail (such complexity, I love that!). Kate becoming Curran\u2019s mate is wreaking havoc in the Pack politics, with most of its members suffering from a collective panic attack . This new situation is unsettling for most of the weres and gives a new edge to the series, with some unexpected twists & developments. Kate Daniels, deadly swordmaster. Fear my twitching pinkie. Kate. Do I really have to go into this? Okay. Hall Hail the Queen of Snarky Badasses. I rest my case. The rabbis paled. I\u2019d managed to terrify holy men. Maybe I could beat up a nun for an encore. The Kate/Curran love story does take precedence over the action in this instalment, which apparently disappointed some readers. I actually liked that the romance part of the series was only a subplot until now and was afraid this would turn into some boring paranormal romance thing. Well, fear not for Ilona Andrews handles things very well. I was annoyed at first because Kate & Curran were both acting stubborn and very childish but it didn\u2019t last long. Besides, things never get corny-mushy between them. With these two? Oh no. They\u2019d rather rip each other apart first! This is no bunnies & rainbows romance. We get some very serious conversations between Kate & His Fuzziness but mostly we get hilarious scenes. The mating game is just hilarious. (view spoiler) [Kate shutting Curran out of the slut hut! Curran gluing Kate's butt to her chair!

What's interesting, now that I think about it, is that my emotions ran parallel to what Kate was feeling at the time , which I have to say is a pretty outstanding feat for an author. I spent the better part of the novel pissed off alongside Kate. The opening scene shows Kate waiting in her kitchen with the dinner she made cooling and her temper heating up.

What's interesting, now that I think about it, is that my emotions ran parallel to what Kate was feeling at the time , which I have to say is a pretty outstanding feat for an author. I spent the better part of the novel pissed off alongside Kate. The opening scene shows Kate waiting in her kitchen with the dinner she made cooling and her temper heating up. She thinks Curran stood her up and when she calls the Keep looking for him she's told that he's busy and not to bother him. She's understandably pissed off. Her first thought is to drive out their and chew his head off, but then she decides that's what the old Kate would do and she's trying to be more responsible. So instead of fighting him, she decides to give him the silent treatment. Of course, Curran has a reason for not showing up for dinner, but there isn't a way for him to explain because she won't talk to him. He's pissed at her, she's pissed at him, and it's all based on a giant misunderstanding caused by someone else. I really wanted them to just sit down and talk, but with their volatile personalities it was believable that they wouldn't be able to just calmly talk things out without destroying something first. The main villain of this installment was brilliant. She's strong, evil, and a threat to everything Kate holds dear. I honestly think there is only one other villain that will hold a candle to her, and he has yet to even grace the pages, except in name and backstory. The villain's henchmen though, were kind of weak. For some reason they didn't have the same creepiness as the vampires and without any sort of separate intelligence they were little more than puppets. Venom was disgusting though. Kate of course, was fantastic. She really is my favorite heroine and probably the one out of all the series I read that I can relate to the most. A few more things I loved that I won't go too far into for fear of spoiling: Catnip/Weight Bench/Glue Grendel: I love that Kate got a furry companion; even if his special power is throwing up on the floor. I was especially glad with the choice she made in regards to the Order. I hope she's finally done dealing with Saiman now, he sure is slimy Naeemah, what she is and who she works for - duh, duh, DUH! The council meeting - I actually said, \"Fuck yeah, Kate!\" out loud. The end/epilogue A few things that made me cry: Kate finally coming clean with Curran and his reaction Marigold : ( The attack on the wolves The final fight I could nitpick and point out the things that bothered me, but there really wasn't all that much. Andrea kind of disappointed me. Some parts of the book were slow and at other times I was worried about where things were going to go so I'd set it aside for a few hours. And like I said, I was pissed off (mostly at Curran) because I agreed with Kate, but the end really fixed everything. Also, it's plain to see that the authors are really setting up things for the long haul and that's not something I'm disappointed by. I just hope they don't drag out this thing with Roland indefinitely and drive the series into the ground, but I always look forward to whatever they write.

When she is called to investigate a fight in a bar right on the border between two of the most powerful groups in Atlanta it seems like a regular assignment, only it turns out to be anything but. Kate also has a lot of personal problems at the moment which adds to the problem. At this time I really have to apologize as I am about to get into a rambling mode, but in this instance I cannot help it. The author(s) mentioned it was a very difficult book for her (them?) to write. Guess what - it shows. To increase a page count (this was my impression) one of the most abused (if not the most abused) cliche of romance genre was invoked. Imagine the following situation: a girl and a guy have a date; the guy does not show up. What would a normal human being (the one from real life) do as the girl in question? Try to get in touch and see that the problem was. Dear girls, please do it; you will have plenty of time to get pissed off later if the guy turned out to be a jerk and just did not feel like going outside. There are some really good reasons for not coming, like being near death. Why did I talk so much about the problem above? It took Kate exactly half of the book (I counted) to resolve this problem - by simply talking to Curran. Poor guy had a lot of broken bones which constitutes a very good excuse for not coming in my book. Why do I have to suffer through 150 pages of Kate's emotional turmoil by her own making entirely? Folks, this is the sole reason the book almost getting 2.5 star rating from me. There are two minor reasons for an extra 0.5 of a star in the rating; taken individually they are not enough, but combined they are. The first one is the humor; while it presents in much lesser quantities considering Kate's dark emotions, it is still there. The second one is my general respect for the series; the monsters for the most part are not the standard variety, including the main villain. Speaking about the latter Kate could figure out his/her identity much earlier had she not been absorbed in her personal problems. Do not read the book's blurb as it gives the identity away. All in all this is the most disappointing book of the series so far which barely made it into 3 star rating. My disappointment with it does not mean I will stop reading the series; I still consider it to be a minor stumble. Dear authors, it is not for me to give you an advice, but if you feel like the book is a struggle to write, stop and reconsider the whole work as it is quite possible you do something wrong and the end result might be underwhelming. I can think of a number of examples of these.

Kate and her bloodthirsty auntie have a \u201cpleasant reunion\u201d. They share memories and stories. They have a cup of tea. Her aunt talks about her old goldfishes, about the loved ones who come and go through the centuries. She talks about how badly she would like to destroy Atlanta and kill every available shapeshifter. They fight to death. HER FAMILY FROM THE PRESENT: 1. Her best friend Andrea. The closet beastkin hyena is in trouble and Kate does not hesitate to offer a real valuable artifact to get her and her boyfriend, Raphael, off the hook. Kate will not hesitate to help Andrea at any cost and any time. 2. Her adopted niece, Julie. Kate agonizes for her safety. She is crazy of worry in case something happens to Julie. She is afraid that her psychopath aunt will try to hurt Julie in order to hurt Kate. 3. The Pack. They have become her closest friends. They run to her rescue, they patch her injuries, they make her feel safe. They are her true home. Kate will not let anyone think less of them and call them nonhuman. 4. The dog. Kate unexpectedly is the proud owner of a poodle who loves to vomit and bark to creatures that threaten Kate. Kate will have a hard time finding a name for him. Everything else will come easy. 5.

The disappointing dinner date will be a good start for Kate to acknowledge her feelings for Curran. The silent treatment, after the disappointing dinner date, will be a good start for Curran to acknowledge the sacrifices he is willing to make for Kate. The games they play and the hilarious pranks they pull on each other, after the explanations about the disappointing dinner date, will make the start of their mating easier. The games and the pranks will be definitely a pure delight for readers as well. Well this is one these books. These books you want to start reading again, the second you finish them.

In my first read through I remember hurrying through parts to get to what was going to happen between Kate and Curran. This time I have the luxury of knowing what will become of them so I was able to focus on all the other great stuff happening as well. Some of the best parts are the great side characters. The introduction of Kate\u2019s new best friend with four legs that looks like a mutant attack poodle was so much fun. I love animal companions in novels. \u201cYou should name him Fezzik,\u201d Andrea said. \u201cInconceivable,\u201d I told her and took the canine traitor back to my office. Alas the dog\u2019s name does not end up being Fezzik but it is much cooler and l loved the reason Kate choose it for him. Once again proving our girl has brains and brawn. But my absolute favorite side character in this is Aunt B. I loved her the first time through as well but this time I really could appreciate just how smart and crafty that lady is. Nothing gets past her and she does seem to have Kate\u2019s best interest at heart especially if it helps out the Bouda clan as well. \u201dDid he spend the night?\u201d Putting claws to my throat was never a good idea. I smiled. \u201cNone of your business.\u201d \u201cSo he did. Did he use the word \u2018mate\u2019?\u201d \u201cWhat happened between me and Curran is our own affair.\u201d Aunt B raised her eyebrows. \u201cCongratulations. Then you are indeed, the mate.\u201d Why me? \u201cThat would be news to me.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you were the last to know.\u201d Saiman, I forgot how wonderfully charming that man/quarter god could be when he wants to be. He has some fantastic interactions with Kate and while he might have overestimated his position in a few things I love some of the scenes with him, especially when he was pulling on deaths whiskers this time around. KATE AND CURRAN!!! Yes this is the book they finally get down to the nitty gritty. It isn\u2019t all roses and sunshine they are both alpha material and totally clash while trying to maintain their dominance. But my girl Kate once she decides what she wants she is ALL IN and nothing and no one will separate her from His Furriness. \u201cIf you come, you better come in force because I will kill every single one of you. My hand won't shake, my aim won't falter. My face will be the last thing you'll see before you die.\" I jammed my knife into the table and walked out.\u201d Forward ho onto the next great installment of the series. If you are a fan of UF/PRN at all this is a fantastically fun series\u2026\u2026 READ IT!!! Original Review 9/28/13 Before I totally fangirl over the Kate/Curran drama \u2026oh and I totally will\u2026.I\u2019ll attempt to talk about the rest of the book. One of the things I like about the Kate Daniels series is that the villain is always based in some sort of lore that I haven\u2019t been overexposed to I\u2019m not even sure if it is real or just made up. In that I feel like I\u2019m learning a little bit more but also I don\u2019t already have a bunch of preconceived notions of how the god/mythical creature should act and it is like starting with a clean sheet. The villain in this installment is undoubtedly the most dangerous and complex that Kate has faced to date. The bad guy carries seven plagues around with them and unleashes them at different times on Atlanta. Each one is devastating and causes incredible havoc. They also have some strange similarities in power to Kate and she doesn\u2019t know how to control her power nearly as well and needs to learn fast. Hugh is busy gathering information on Kate to make sure he knows everything about her before presenting her to Roland and is biding his time through this newest crisis. Kate knows that soon she will have to face her father and is desperately struggling with either going it completely alone or letting people into her life. But to do that she will have to come clean and tell the people closest to her who she really is. You can\u2019t smelt happiness out of a lie. The world doesn\u2019t work that way. The character I most enjoyed this book beside the new addition of the attack poodle and Kate and Curran or course was Aunt B. She is sneaky, manipulative, intelligent an opportunist and at times even the voice of reason. I really like the way she runs her clan of hyenas and how she interacts with Kate. Aunt B is the alpha that you definitely do not want to get on the wrong side of. The deal she makes with Kate is one that benefits Kate but also helps her. I like how she is an example and a strong female character without being portrayed exclusively as a bitch. The plot arc was one of the strongest of the series and delved into the magic of the world Kate lives in even more. This is probably the strongest book in the series to date. Okay on to the fangirling of the romance aspect of this book. There may be a few minor spoilers don\u2019t read on if you don\u2019t want to know. Cat courting practices are interesting to say the least and a little dangerous it seems to any that stand to close\u2026ehmm Saiman cough cough. I was worried at the beginning of the story that the minor misunderstanding between Kate and Curran was going to derail them for an entire book (I\u2019ve seen it done in other series and I\u2019m not a fan) but no worries all is made well again before the end. Kate miserable without Curran in her life decides to try to play by his rules and it is about time. I loved that she finally decided, this is what I want, and took charge. Even if later she doubts herself and her choices I admire the initial push in the right direction. There are some very good steamy scenes and I love that everything isn\u2019t roses for them right after. They have distinctly different personalities and wants. Curran is desperate to protect Kate and Kate is desperate to run into the face of danger and sacrifice herself if needed. But tenderness and vulnerability are definitely there at the blooming of their relationship. \u201cPeople think I built the Pack, because I'm the guy who has the welfare of all shapeshifters in mind. They're wrong. Everything I built, I did so that when I mate and have children, nobody can touch my family. (...) I built all this so I can protect you.\u201d Plus being Mated to the Beast Lord isn\u2019t all glamorous. You live in a glass house always surrounded by people watching looking for an edge something to give them the upper hand looking for any weakness to exploit. I couldn\u2019t believe how fast some of the pack turned after the main battle. I\u2019m ecstatic that Kate and Curran have finally made some progress on this front since the tension between them was killing me. Like the end of other books in this series it really just made me want more. I can\u2019t wait to see what will happen to the main Alpha\u2019s next. ...more Currently rereading this with the fun chicks over at the Ilona Andrews Addicts group.

My crazy aunt took me to a gay bar when I was 16 years old (I didn't realize that some of those women weren't men...). Hey, I was just happy to be in a bar at 16, I had no idea... But, Kate's aunt is literally a psychopath: \"You're a psychopath.\" \"What does that mean?\" I got up and brought her a dictionary. She read the definition. \"That sums it up well, yes....\" Not exactly Auntie Em. But, one of the best parts of this book, to me, was the addition of Kate's new dog - the attack poodle. I am a dog person. I have three dogs, two of them are very large labs, and the things Kate says about her attack poodle cracked me up so much because I could, unfortunately, relate. Apparently \"stay\" in faithful canine companion language meant \"follow with enthusiastic glee.\" ...I opened the door and saw a huge slimy pile of dog puke cooling in the middle of my hallway carpet. The attack poodle sat nearby, an expression of perfect innocence on his narrow mug. I pointed at the puke. \"That was a dick move.\" The attack poodle wagged his tail. ... The attack poodle trotted around me and proceeded to vomit an inch from my left boot. \"Delightful,\" Saiman reflected as the dog, having puked his guts out, urinated on the nearest wall. \"He's a dog of simple pleasures,\" I told him. Okay, this ^ stuff really got me laughing out loud, in the middle of the night, while all of my family was trying to sleep. If I'm not careful, they will be calling me a psychopath pretty soon! ...more First read July 2014 Second read May 2016 Rating: Same. (I'll explain) This book is called Magic Bleeds.

And I really had to stop thinking about him, because it hurt. When you don't know what's really happening, don't you just want to kill Curran?? How could he do that to poor Kate?? Curran likes to play. He's a cat after all. a big one, but still a cat. He is attracted to power, which Kate has in large quantities. I think he was cynical in this book. Even his thoughts were cynical ( Curran POV Collection ). He wants Kate, but he's not eager to sacrifice anything. He demands things from Kate and gives nothing in return, because he's the Beast Lord . One of the best parts of the book was the Conclave scene. Oh, how I loved Saiman there. I was enjoying so much that Curran was suffering. \u201cThere is only one difference between us. The Beast Lord will lie to you. He\u2019ll tell you he loves you, that you\u2019ll always be the only one, that he\u2019ll sacrifice everything to be with you and keep you safe. I won\u2019t lie to you. I won\u2019t make promises I can\u2019t keep. Honesty, Kate. I offer honesty.\u201d I couldn't agree more. This. THIS is the reason for my disbelief towards Curran. Take it, you jerk! And the other best part was when Kate massacred all her challengers. She is a total kickass/badass. Of course there were some steeamyyy scenes, that uhhh... And the humor is never absent: \u201cWhile you\u2019re with me, I\u2019m the only one. Anybody else touches you and I\u2019ll kill them.\u201d \u201cWhat if I accidentally bump into someone?\u201d Gold flashed in his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d 4 **** stars , because: \"Besides, if Curran didn't think you're fit, he wouldn't have made the offer. Yes, he's obsessed with you, but he's shrewd enough to take your ability into consideration. Alphas are typically attracted to other alphas. I wouldn't mate with a weakling, and neither would he. This part, and oh so many others, make me think that the only reason Curran wants Kate is so she can help him protect his damn Pack . So you can understand now why I started liking him only at the end of book #7 and in book #8. Nevertheless, the book was full of good action. Secondary characters make this book awesome. Dr Doolittle is so funny. Have you guys noticed the age difference between Julie and Derek is 6 years, same as in Kate/Curran?

And hours later, she decides she's been played for a fool. A few weeks later, she is back at work and determined to forget her feelings for the Beast Lord. She gets pulled into a case, where a mysterious being is bringing a plague to Atlanta. Throughout the course of the investigation, Kate has to use her contacts with the mercenary guild, Saiman, and even the shapeshifters. Which throws her plan to avoid Curran out of the window. It's clear these two are crazy about each other, but there's a lot working against them... The worst offenders are their responsibilities and stubbornness. But it is so gratifying to watch them work it out. Their relationship is so great, because they can retain their individual strengths, while allowing the other in. During their courtship, we learn a lot about Curran's background and pack politics. Not only that, we see what it will mean if Kate needs to carve herself a place in his life. While Kate's personal life heats up, her investigation into the Plaguemaker takes a more personal turn. As so many things in her life do, it ends up with a major connection to Roland. And it forces her to share some of her most closely kept secrets. AND THERE IS FINALLY SOME SEX. I can't say enough about how good this book was. Not only does it put most other series to shame... It puts the first two books in this series to shame as well. All hail Kate Daniels. 5 stars. ...more \"Just wait until he figures out I shut him out of his slut hut.\" You know in my review of Magic Strikes when I said that Kate and Curran are frustratingly cute ?

It's strange because before reading Magic Bleeds I didn't and couldn't have the slightest idea of what this expression actually means. \u2022If Kate and Curran were frustratingly cute before, now they are excruciatingly adorable .

Their on-off relationship will drive you out of your mind, the tension between them is -positively- unbearable, and the chemistry is sky-high . \u2022In this regard, Kate is begginig to show a considerable development . She must learn to deal with her past, her education, she must accept the kind of person she want to be in relation with the kind of warrior her stepfather wanted her to become, and find a balance between the two. It's lovely to see how her life changed from book one up to now, how she passed from being a solitary creature to being surrounded by so many caring people and how she adapted to this. It's like I can physically see her characters grow and develop and evolve in front of my eyes, and given how much I take the characters into account when rating a book, this played a key role in my enjoyment. \u2022The plot is maybe less crucial (as I said, the book is mainly centered about the characters), but surely as captivating as Magic Strike 's was, and once again the balance between the most introspective parts and the most fast-paced and action-packed ones was absolutely satisfying , a great improvement compared to book one and two, where in comparison the characters were practically invisible. \u2022 Curran . I have nothing specific to say about him, but I thought I ought to name a paragraph after him. So, Curran . I just asked my parents for a Curran all mine and they said they'll begin to save some money. If you want to contribute, I can give you their number. Just gift me a Curran . Curran . You see how nice his name is? (Not only the name, ahem). So pleasant to pronounce. Curraaaaaan . Cur-ra-an . (I can't believe I'm Lolitaing him... and I can't believe I used Lolita as a verb.) Ok, ok, I'll stop now. Sorry. But Curran - *keeps obsessing and talking to herself ad libitum * ...more One of my favorite in the series! If you got to the 4th book then there is no need for me to tell you to read this. If you haven't read any of Kate Daniels' books and you like Urban Fantasy than what are you waiting for? What I liked about this particular novel was that we finally meet a member of the Kate's family. I kind of liked her aunt even if she was supposed to be the villain. There were some power games between Curran and Kate, some entertaining, some annoying. Yeap...Another one done just like that! Once again the book was in the \"best\" category full of action, mystery and romance. This series is one of a kind, every book leaves you panting for more.

Unknown disease spreading baddies have been starting brawls at bars in several cities and now they have reached their target. Atlanta and the Pack are about to meet 7 undead magic users controlled by Erra, an ancient Babylonian goddess of chaos and terror and biological aunt of our one and only Kate Daniels. Kate has to either defeat her aunt and risk exposing to the world her heritage or fly the city and let her friends stand alone. This book like any other had it's good and it's bad moments. The goodies 1) It had moments when you couldn't stop laughing your head off. Once or twice you couldn't stop grinning like an idiot several pages at a time. 2) Kate continues to be one of the best heroines I've come across. Loyal, stubborn, smart and with authority issues that land her in troubles all the time, yet she never learns! She doesn't whine, she doesn't break down, she isn't fond of girly stuff and she doesn't accept shit from anyone. What's not to love? 3) The \"flirting\" between Curran and Kate is beyond hilarius. The only think I can think that can rival it is the limps removal in Lothaire and this is hard to beat! 4) At last Kate admits the truth to her friends about her parentage and accepts that Curran is her mate. 5) Erra is one of the best villains I've ever come across. She is completely without remorse or conscience. She can sit down and drink tea with you now and kill you the moment the cookies run out. She was by far one of my favorite characters in this book. But of course Kate isn't about to run scared from one homocidal bitch. The baddies Really there aren't so many here. At some point I wanted to slap Andrea, I generally like her but she kind of let me down in this book. And the second is Saiman. Saiman I also kind of liked in the previous books but in this one I just wanted him to go away! In general the book was as awesome as the previous ones and then some!

Last night as I was trying to sleep, I had the perfect review written, it was unfolding beautifully, words dancing around in my head with little effort. I should have gotten up to write it then, instead of waiting until it disappeared... Pregnancy insomnia at its finest, leaving you unable to sleep, but also, reluctant to physically get out of bed. Magic Bleeds is essentially the turning point, the pivotal book in the Kate Daniels Series. It's a will they or won't they book. {Speaking of Kate and Curran of course} Ilona and Gordon crafted a well written, strong plot, with a very prominent relationship storyline. The Villain of Magic Bleeds was a welcome surprise. I never guessed, not could figure out who the bad villain was until I was told, and then I was all like \"WOAH! Totally AWESOME!!!\" I love when an author can surprise me. Too many times lately a book or series is very predicatable, and it is so refreshing to have authors who just GET IT. They get how to write a crafty plot without giving us who it is, they put out little red herrings, and then bash you over the head with the real deal. It's fun, exciting, and appealing to the reader. Let's talk about Kate for a minute. Kate is one of my favorite heroines of all the book series I have read to date, and that is quite a few, especially in this genre of Urban Fantasy and Paranormal Fantasy/Romance. Kate is fierce. She is fiercely loyal to those she cares about, despite her fathers warning to remain closed off and to become a sociopath. She is fiercely independent, although she longs for companionship and love. She is fiercely private, to a fault; where she can't trust anyone with her secrets, her heart, or her life. She is a master with her saber, will kick your ass if you threaten her or what she considers hers. She is all the things a quality leading lady should be, despite her 'not being a lady'  Her mouth get's her into trouble, and she often takes the approach of kill now, ask questions later. She has earned the right to claim that she is a walking, talking, bad ass, but she won't. She knows she is, but she's not egocentric which is nice to read. She does what she feels she has to do. To protect. Protect herself, protect her friends, and protect humanity. One of the themes I found most prevelant in Magic Bleeds is love. Despite Kate feeling like she will never have the kind of love she desperately wants, she can't help but be hurt at Curran's no show for their dinner. As she tries to put him out of her mind and move forward, he is constantly creeping into her thoughts, intruding in her life. He invades her privacy. She grieves for the man she wants, and feels she will never have. At the same time she is royally pissed off and humiliated and she does not know how to deal with these emotions. She's quite volatile. I wanted to give her a hug, but didn't want to get my eye jabbed by her sword. When Kate and Curran first see each other, it's, well, it's hard to read, and awkward and you can feel the energy leaping off the page. The way Kate handles it is classic, and sort of funny, but not in a good way funny. But funny nonetheless because of who kate is and how her mouth works. You know the expression... Insert foot? Well, Kate obviously doesn't :) Fans of the series will be engrossed, enraged, and enthralled with the Kate and Curran storyline. Have faith that Ilona and Gordon know what they are about. They do. And they do it brilliantly. The battle scenes are great. The plot is interesting without being crazy. The death toll rises. Kate does indeed lose much in this book. The end pages are killer. The last 50 pages or so are gut wrenching, jarring, sad, and finally bow down at Ilona and Gordon's feet and proclaim them your masters :) I jest, but seriously, the ending is fantastic. Just the right amount of everything. Grief, Pain, Hope, Love, and Future. The book is amazing. I can't wait for Kate Daniels 5. I have no negatives with regards to this book. The pace is on par with all the other books, the writing is superb, the angst is real, the battles are bloody, hope is alive. ...more While the covers never cease being hideous, each installment in the Kate Daniels series hasn't ceased to entertain me thus far.

The fourth installment, Magic Bleeds , features a crocodile shapeshifter, a splendid impersonation of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and a battle to end all battles. It is one hell of a ride. I think one of the best things about this series is that it is appealing to both genders. It has lots of action, which of course men like, but I think I speak for all women when I say that we like action, too. It keeps things interesting and wards off dullness. There's also just the right amount of romance. Not so much that would make guys squeamish, but still enough to keep the ladies satisfied. And, while I think the first book was slightly lacking in this area, the humor is now on par with my taste as well. Kate seems to have better quips with each installment and never looses her nerve, even with Curran. And the banter and antics between Kate and Curran are sure to entertain most readers. I have theories on some of the reasons why Kate and Curran are attracted to each other. I think Kate likes Curran because he's one of the few people who could take her in a fight. Imagine if every guy you met you were superior to in fighting skills and he couldn't even win against you in a late-night arm wrestle. I'm sure there are plenty of women who enjoy being the stronger of the two in their relationship, but I don't believe that's the kind of relationship Kate wants. That is just one of the many reasons why Kate and Crest never would have worked out. I think Curran makes Kate feel like a woman for the first time in a long time. And although he'd probably never admit it, I believe Curran's attracted to Kate because she doesn't take any of his shit. Unlike everyone else in his life, she doesn't bow to him, literally or figuratively. I think, secretly, the Beast Lord wants someone to treat him like a normal man, like he's just another person, even if only in private. At times, Curran and Kate collide like fire and kerosene - but they truly fit together like two matching jigsaw pieces. And do I smell a potential spin-off series in the oven? Granted, the buzzer won't go off for at least a couple of years, but when it does it'll surely be some good eatin'! Here's my reasoning: In Magic Strikes we find out through a conversation that Kate was nine when Curran was fifteen and made Lord of all Beasts. This, of course, tells us that Curran is six years older than Kate. Well, we know that Julie and Derek are thirteen and nineteen, respectively, as of now. Do you see where I'm going with this? Once Julie gets older, her and Derek could have their own series! Her abilities coupled with the adolescent attraction she currently has for Derek could really make for an interesting future series. . . . I'll be honest: people with weak stomachs may not be able to stomach some of the talk of entrails and the bloody descriptions in this series. With lots of action comes lots of violence and gore. Normally that sort of thing would bother me, but I've gotten so used to it with this series that I don't even notice anymore. Plus it just seems to fit with this world. I'm actually feeling a little sad now because I know that once I finish the next installment, Magic Slays , that'll be it until February of 2013 when the next book is released. I've quickly become addicted to this series and I'm reluctant to leave it. P.S. But, luckily, Andrews won't leave us hanging until then!

Original review: So Kate's got a cray-cray Aunt that comes to town to bring end of the world catastrophes and diseases and stuff to humans and shape-shifters alike. Just another day in the life. This was a good book. A lot really happens here, esp. involving Kate and Curran. Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes. I know I'm reading this one after the fact and most people here have already devoured it and moved on, but in my view, Ilona Andrews really knows how to do the world-building thing. Other urban fantasy authors are really gonna have to step their game up now that this formidable writing team is around and here to stay.

It seemed like finally everything we'd been waiting for between Curran and Kate was going to happen. And then I sat, alongside Kate, as it all came shattering down. Curran didn't show. Curran didn't take her call. Kate was hurt, and devastated, and then she got mad. I was right there with her. It's hard to talk about this book without a lot of spoilers. The plot - again - is tightly written and the pacing is spot on. I could hardly catch my breath while I read. Everyone got in on the action here - the Masters of the Dead, the shapeshifters, the Order and the Guild - no one was safe. And then there's the villain. So utterly perfect, and terrifying. The stakes keeping getting ramped up, and the opponents keep getting more difficult to deal with. Ilona Andrews is doing a superb job of ratcheting up the suspense in the lead up to what we all know has to come eventually for Kate; the thing she's been training her whole life for. Though I didn't get the payout I wanted at the beginning of Magic Bleeds , I definitely got satisfaction. Watching Kate and Curran circle each other, tease each other, and go through their own mating ritual made me grin, laugh out loud, and so incredibly happy when they finally figured out how to make it work. The final showdown, I can't even begin to talk about, but it had me on the edge of my seat. Then when it was done, they went and ripped my heart out, stomped on it a couple of times, and handed me back the mushy remains. Magic Bleeds proves that Ilona Andrews is in top form.

In Magic bleeds , we get to see a more vulnerable side of Kate though for the first time ever (from what I remember, that means maybe not really) and that is mainly due to a somewhat ( totally, very, absolutely - you get the idea ) silly misunderstanding between Kate and Curran at the start of the book, caused by their absolute incompetence at using a telephone to its full capacity, and partially due to Kate starting to question all the things her stepfather taught and preached her over the years to ensure her survival. But fear not, there is more than enough fun action to compensate for all the teenager-in-love behaviour, and Kate faces an attack poodle, Saiman, a powerful thousands of years old villain,... and much more .

I have nothing bad to say about it! I can't remember the last time I thought that about a book. There is drama, action, romance, pain, blood, passion, happiness, betrayal, political scheming, sword play, family hatred, loyalty, love. The list goes on and on. Every emotion imaginable and all of them real, supported, and understandable. As I read I laughed out loud, gasped, pleaded with the characters, feared for them, was happy with them. I was holding my breath until the very end. I feel like I don't know what to say about this book other than how happy I am to have read it and that I am already sweating out the wait until the next book in 2011! I started the Kate Daniels series this year and have read every Ilona Andrews work since that fateful first novel. The Andrew's team is my author find of the year and are for sure on my automatic to buy list along with Briggs for now on.

We went camping a few days ago. And I hate camping even when everything goes perfectly. This time, the boys and I got a stomach bug. It wasn't one of those debilitating bugs, unfortunately, because then we could have left. No. It was just one of those bugs that made you 'uncomfortable'. 1:00 am *ACHOO!* Moooooom!!!! I sharted ! Do you have any idea what it's like to have to walk a kid ( who has shit in their pants ) down to a woodsy 'bathhouse' at 1:00 in the morning? Only to have them realize ( far too late to get new PJs ) that the liquid they expelled has drizzled into their pajama pants? Now imagine that same kid running full-tilt back to the camper, in the dark, through the woods, squealing, in nothing but their ( new/clean ) underwear. My poor kid is still having nightmares about the hysterical laughter that trailed them back to safety. Sorry, baby. I get a little slap-happy when I've had no sleep. Also, it was just damn funny to watch you crash through the brush like your little ass was on fire. But beyond my nightly entertainment, there wasn't much to do. It's not like we could chance a hike. Upset tummies don't mix well with long treks away from the potty. So. The boys and I sat in the camper. Fun Fact: Boys have a shelf life of about 8 hours, before they start to smell really bad. So. Thank you, Kate, for allowing me to mentally escape from my family vacation. Oh My GAWD! This is it , people! Book 4 is the one where they finally ... Is it a spoiler if I say it out loud? *bites nails* Hmm. I'm not sure, to be quite honest. But , for those of you who know what I'm talking about? *squee!* Alrighty, this book isn't just amazing because of the thing . There's also a whole lotta action 'n suspense stuff to go along with it. Kate meets up with her eeeevil aunt! OMG! How will this effect her future?! Will Roland find her now?! Will the Pack be a bigger target?! What about Julie?! I'm using too many exclamation points, aren't I? I'm not sure how to describe how into these books I am right now. I. Can't. Stop. In fact, I've already checked out the next book from my library. Oh! Oh! There's an attack poodle in this one! How can you resist a series that has an attack poodle?! You can't! No one could resist that ! I haven't found any UF series that I liked as much a my beloved Mercy Thompson , but Kate Daniels is a very close second, at this point. If you're looking for a kick-ass heroine, no weird sex (view spoiler) [ and by that, I mean they don't bite each other in odd places (hide spoiler) ] , and a lot of interesting characters, then you might want to start on this series right away. ...more", "Title": "Magic Bleeds"},
