This is the worst book I have ever read. Why, oh, why did I read it? I should have listened to the Fates (<---B> Kat , Paige , Phoebe </---B>). They warned me of this, but I didn't listen. I almost ALWAYS agree with them on books. Why did I think this would be a different story? I will never doubt your wisdom again, ladies. This one time I let myself be influenced by another popular reviewer who claimed to absolutely love this book. I was conned! Fooled! Bamboozled! Hoodwinked! The only logical answer is that Hades himself was behind the plot to fry my remaining brain cells. *rubs chin* Yes, that must be it. I've been trolled by the Lord of the Underworld himself. HADES!! ARE YOU HAPPY?! ARE YOU FUCKING HAPPY NOW?! WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY FOR YOURSELF?! Y-y-you heartless bastard.<---F> This review will not be nice</---F>. No one will be spared. Not even the children. *flips through her notebook* Good thing I took plenty of notes then. Hahahaha! The Writing Dear, Gandhi! It was terrible! Immediately when I started to read, I felt my eye balls start rebuking me. \"Noooooooooo, don't make us! You are evil! You are heartless! Why do you hate us! We've been good to you!\" I'm not exaggerating when I say this was amateur at best and eye-bleeding bad at worse. The book is littered with ridiculously \u00a0simple sentences that remind me of a children's book. \"See Helen Spot run? Helen Spot can run fast! Run, Helen Spot. Run!\" Metaphors and similes exsit for a reason. Let's use them. But that's not event the worst of it. There were countless pages of info-dumping as well. SHOW DON'T TELL! And the dialogue...OMFG. It was painfully obvious that they were trying entirely too hard to sound like \"hip\" teens. \"What the holy hand grenade was that?\" It felt goofy as hell. \"Unbefrickinglievable,\" Hector cusses quietly into the silence. I just wanted to shake them. Shake them all. The Plot The plot was a damn mess. Basic run down: - Lucas and his Brady Bunch family move to the neighborhood. - Helen and Lucas almost kill each other. - They break curse/spell/whatever and fall in love over night. - Oh noz! Helen is in danger. - Helen suddenly becomes a sex kitten. - Lucas denies her advances. - Helen wonders if he is gay. Contemplates sex change. \"...she decided that if Lucas was gay then she was going to have to get a sex change operation. He would be so worth it.\" - Demi-god training. - Oh, but wait!\u00a0Now, she is invincible! - \"Sex, please,\" says Helen. \"No means no, Helen. It would destroy the world!\" Lucas cries. - Shit happens, people die. - \"OMG! So we won't destroy the world after all! I'm horny. Let's do it,\" Lucas declares. *rams tongue down throat* \"Ew. We are first cousins! We can never be together! Fuck our fuckin' life!\" she whines. Fin. Keep up Hades! Angelini tries to confuse the readers with her many plot twists, but all the plot really does is run around the mulberry\u00a0bush chasing the weasel. There was nothing clever about it. I could tell that I was supposed to be like, \"Whoa! My teeny little brain never saw that coming!\" IT NEVER HAPPENED! Helen Let's play Name That Sue ! But first you're going to need a few clues about her personality: - I'm super beautiful, but I don't notice it! - I'm the \"last\" person in my family. Woe is me! - I'm so powerful and useless, love me! - I'm so selfless. Here, let me love you! - My characterization has been used over and over in tons of books, but I have super speshul powers! \u00a0I'm kewler than them! Answers: Black Hole Sue , God Mode Sue , Sympathetic Sue , Anti-Sue ... my god. It's too many Sues to count! It's a Thirty Sue Pileup ! Helen is an idiot. Most of the novel she's running around with twinkling stars in her eyes and clueless to everything that is happening around her. She is beautiful in every way. So much so, that it is normal for people to just sit and stare at her. Everybody loves her and the world kisses her ass every chance it gets.\u00a0Her favorite hobbies include going grocery shopping, cooking for her dad, doing homework, and personal hygiene. Oh hey, Bella! I didn't see you there! The moment Helen and Lucas stop attempting to end each other's life, they immediately start holding hands and declaring their love for one another. (Oh, insta-love! How I hate thee!) She's never had a boyfriend or been kissed until Lucas and his family move into town.\u00a0There is just something about Lucas that brings out everything in Helen. And I do mean everything. Her entire life she has had all these powerful mystical powers, but she never knew about them because whenever she would use them unknowingly in front of mortals she would get a nasty bout of menstrual cramps! Little does Helen know that her cramps were a cursed placed on her by her very own mother. But it was totally for her protection. Of course. *eyeroll* If that isn't some bullshit, I don't know what is. So anyway, with every new plot twist, Helen seems to get a new power. Which basically means she keeps getting more and more useless. All she does is say, \"Oh, but I don't want to hurt anyone! Even if they are trying to kill me, I can't justify their deaths!\" Are you kidding me? She has no sense of self-preservation. \"I knew if I started blocking him he'd just get angrier, and then I would eventually have no choice by to hit him so hard he wouldn't be able to hit me back.\" She.is.a. demi-god . Go on and let it out, Hades! That was during a SELF-DEFENSE session. How is it that a character can be so powerful and do NOTHING with her powers? What is the point?!*breath in, breath out* Sorry, guys. The stupidity makes it hard to breath. Thankfully, one of the other characters noticed this madness and said: \"She'd better get it in her. Because I don't want any of the people I love to die defending her lazy ass.\" That was the only good part of the entire book. >_> Then I hit the next chapter and Cassandra has a sword aimed for Helen's head and she JUST STANDS THERE. Cassandra swung her sword. In that millisecond Helen knew she'd had a good life, because she suddenly loved it so much that she could have wept with gratitude. She'd had amazing friends, the best dad in the world, and a strong, healthy body... I thought she was going to finally die! I was like, \"Yes! KILL HER NOW! Doooo iiiittttt!\" And you know what happens? She levels up out of nowhere! Why won't she roll over and die already?! So now she's invincible and can't be killed by any weapons AND she's the most powerful demi-god. REALLY?! >Implied Facepalm< Yet, believe it or not all those things I could have semi-forgiven and gave this book 1 star, maybe 2 for good effort. The biggest problem with this book: It's SEXIST. This book offended me on so many levels, it's not even funny. Let me count the ways: Causal jokes about domestic abuse: \"I'll just tell him you abuse me,\" she said with a shrug. \"And I'll tell him you like it,\" he teased back. That shit is not amusing. AT ALL. Lots of women suffer from domestic abuse every day and Angelini pokes fun?! What messages are we sending our young girls? That this is romantic banter? This is why young girls think it is okay to tweet crazy shit like they would let Chris Brown hit them any time. This is why we are seeing people happy about him singing songs with Rihanna. We need to speak up against this. IT IS NOT OKAY! \u00a0OMG, I'm so angry right now, I'm seeing red. RAGE. Use your powers in the kitchen!: Everything about Ariadne was so feminine and round and lovely that Helen simply couldn't imagine anyone hitting her. \"Do you guys do this to each other often? The fighting, I mean.\" Ariadne was shaking her head before Helen had even finished talking. \"No. We spar together to stay in shape , but only the boys really fight , and only when they need to get something off their chests.\" WHAT?! \u00a0The only reason why they fight is to stay in shape ? THEY ARE DEMI-GODS!!!!! Controlling boyfriend: \"Now go to sleep,\" he ordered. Come again? He what?! Oh, hell no. Let a guy come home and start ordering me around. I've got two words for him: Bitch, please. He kissed her neck and said he was sorry over and over, but try as she might, he wouldn't let her face him. She began to feel like she was being used. OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG. \"Is Zach after you?\" Lucas asked with wide eyes. \"Oh, not really. He wants to talk to me about something, I think,\" Helen said as if it wasn't important. She shut her mouth before she could say too much. \"Yeah, I'll bet,\" Lucas said with a sneer, his blue eyes turning nearly black as he sensed her untruth. Is there any reason for Zach to think that you might be single?\" At this point he never even asked her to be his girl friend! He goes throughout most of the book just holding her hand, but telling everyone else they don't really have a relationship. And then he pulls this line: \"Are you trying to make me jealous or are you just so frustrated that you're already looking for someone else? Someone who would give in to you?\" I just... can't. Women should be held to high standards and oh, yeah, they're evil: \" A lady never cheapened herself by using foul language.\" And: \"He had sworn to remove the feminine evil of the cestus from the world so that all men could control their lust. Yup, thats right. It's totally a woman's fault a man can't control himself. I can't believe women have been fighting for RIGHTS just so we can write about this kind of stuff! Around 80% this book gets super ridiculous with making Helen and her mother out to be \"semxy sex pots\". Helen is so damn useless powerful and horny that she pretty much starts playing Lady GaGa's Love Game, trying to take off Lucas' clothes\u00a0at every opportunity she gets. Let's have some fun this beat is sick. I wanna take a ride on your disco stick! I suppose this is what she is supposed to look like: I can see you staring there from across the block with a smile on your mouth and a hand on your HUH! There are a ton of other problems with this book, but I've wasted enough of my life with Starcrossed. I probably have enough anger and quotes to write a damn book myself. I just... can't. I'm offended this was written. I offended that it was published. I offended people think this is okay. This book FAILED at failing.

Lucas, also, wishes to kill Helen in a horrifically violent way because they\u2019re both demigods on the opposite side of a war. I really thought this book was going to kill me \u2013 either with hypertension or an aneurysm for all the times it had me almost screaming in frustration. For example: Lucas is violently dragging Helen out of a supermarket. Helen doesn\u2019t want to leave and is worried that Lucas is going to kill her but can\u2019t say or do anything or she\u2019ll make a scene. No. Fuck no. Girls, if someone is manhandling you against your will then that is actually the perfect time to make a scene! Why is this concept of meek submissiveness in women perpetuated? It literally costs women their lives to be like this. I\u2019m not shitting you. Making a scene saved my life once. Big time. It was the difference between seeing my parents that night \u2013 or never again. Or what about the part where Helen is debating meeting up with Lucas, who she knows has been trying to hurt her? However, she has a feeling that he won\u2019t kill her because he doesn\u2019t seem like the type. Are we trying to perpetuate a mindset in young women that could directly cause them severe harm? Approximately 2/3 of rapes were committed by someone known to the victim. 73% of sexual assaults were perpetrated by a non-stranger. 38% of rapists are a friend or acquaintance. 28% are an intimate. 7% are a relative. \"Girls ages 16-19 are 4 times more likely than the general population to be victims of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault.\" Nobody is more vulnerable than the young girls reading these novels yet, consistently, there are messages that impede them from knowing what the right and normal responses are to sexual assault or physical violence perpetuated against them. What I also find quite aggravating is that, in this novel, all the girls at school are jealous of Helen because she\u2019s just too beautiful. Look, there are a variety of reasons why people might not like you. Your manners, social skills, lifestyle, personality, politics, religion, race, style, if you like Nickelback\u2026 If you think the only reason that people don\u2019t like you is because you\u2019re just too beautiful then maybe you should reconsider. It\u2019s more likely that they despise you because your head is so far up your own ass that you could perform a colonoscopy with your own nose. And, yes, you\u2019re all welcome for that little mental image. But even if you took all these factors away, I STILL wouldn\u2019t like this book. Angelini seems confused over what makes love powerful, or Starcrossed love tragic. Look, it wasn\u2019t just that Romeo and Juliet *spoiler* died that made the story powerful. Lucas and Helen don\u2019t really hate each other and nobody in this story actually has a reason to hate anyone else. It\u2019s all a manufactured emotion by the furies to get them to fight. But this misses the point completely because if the hate isn\u2019t real and thus meaningless, then the love isn\u2019t real and thus meaningless too! Neither are real emotions and both are just created by the furies to perpetuate their story arcs. And Lucas and Helen not being together isn\u2019t tragic because they never sacrificed anything to be together anyway. Romeo turned his back on his family and tried to befriend a hated foe, in the process losing his best friend. The tragedy is that he makes a terrible decision and then fate, from that point on, makes it impossible for him to redeem the situation. The tragedy is that Juliet takes a leap of faith, trusts in others and Romeo, is brave enough to step out and defy her family, only to be betrayed by destiny and left to wake alone and deserted in a tomb. My frustration with YA authors is that I think they forget what it\u2019s like to be teenagers and in love. I think they write characters and try to convince the reader that the love these people are experiencing is so strong it can conquer anything \u2013 that it\u2019s epic love. Most of the time I don\u2019t think these couples would last a year, let alone eternity. Because, after all, when they survive the scheming madman or the ancient prophecy against their love, will they be able to survive each other? The miserly old crone in me thinks, no. ********************************Spoilers below************************************** WTF is up with the ending?! Helen: Oh Lucas, I love you so much! Lucas: Helen, I love you too! Our love in unconquerable! Eternal! All-consuming! Helen: Damn the fact that us being together means the gods will unleash their wrath upon the earth and that innocent people will die! Let\u2019s be together anyway! Lucas: I agree! The feelings I have for you are so strong that I can\u2019t stay away \u2013 no matter the damage this will do to countless people and to my entire family! Helen: Wait! I just found out that we\u2019re cousins! Lucas: Oh! Gross! Well, I guess I\u2019ll see you around some time then. Helen: Yeah! That was close! Well, have a nice life then, Lucas. *Kat tears hair out in frustration* Okay, so possibility of war and danger and impossible obstacles, they can overcome, but the fact that their love impinges on antiquated social norms destroys it? Look, I\u2019m not exactly advocating that you seek out your cousins for the purposes of reproduction here. However, if you were to find out tomorrow that your significant other has been your cousin all along, is it really that big a deal? After all, it is not uncommon for siblings, separated at birth, to accidentally find each other as adults and marry. There\u2019s been more than one case of people finding out after marriage that they were closely related. Also, that they are being separated merely because of the fact that apparently NOBODY can do some basic mathematics? [image error] Numbers\u2026too\u2026 hard\u2026to\u2026subtract! Lastly, apparently if the furies don\u2019t repeat these storylines, the fabric of the universe is going to come apart.

And put it up on fb! And my space! Oh I cnt w8 2 read dis! ...and that is why, ladies and gentlemen, Josephine Angelini will be laughing her way to the bank in a couple of months, when the book comes out! I think I would have enjoyed this book more if the soundtrack of Bella\u2019s Lullaby hadn\u2019t been running in my head the whole time. What is Starcrossed about, you ask. Starcrossed is the story of a painfully shy, socially inept girl who meets a really hot boy with whom she feels an instant \u2018connection\u2019 even though they must stay away from each other for fear that one of them may kill the other. However, this (seemingly insurmountable) problem is soon solved when girl and boy save each other\u2019s lives, thereby easing the path to true luurve. The boy has a large, close-knit family, some of whom are warm and welcoming while the others are hostile and suspicious of the girl. The girl, unbeknownst to her, has been super-speshul all her life, but neither this, not her stunning beauty (of which she is also largely unaware) has catapulted her to fame and popularity. In short, she is a wallflower who likes to hide behind her hair. (I wonder if her hair, too, smells of strawberry shampoo? *random Twilight factoid*) Anyway, moving on, boy and girl do, of course, fall in love, but they can NEVER be together! Or at least, not without causing the destruction of all human civilisation! (Wow, I knew teenage dating was a minefield, but this is the first time I\u2019ve heard of it being a nuclear warhead!) Of course, boy\u2019s family are very different from the rest of their kind, they don\u2019t believe in killing, except in self-defense, and have moved into a small town to avoid the rest of their clan, who are rabid, psychotic killers. Blessed with extraordinary good looks and great athleticism, the boys of the family are all star footballers. Where there is true love, of course, there must be danger. There are a whole bunch of people out to get the girl, including a very dangerous member of boy\u2019s psychopathic extended family. So while girl is busy debating whether boy likes her, since he is making no moves towards her, boy\u2019s cousin is hunting down girl. Girl is being protected by stalker-ish members of boy\u2019s family. Until girl finds out that boy has vowed never to touch her, goes off in a snit, gets attacked, gets rescued, sneaks boy upto her room while oblivious single father watches TV and declares her love, only to find out the shattering truth that keeps them apart. Sounding familiar yet? Yeah, so basically, this is fanfic. This is what you get when a Twifan decides, why don\u2019t I make Bella and Edward demigods instead of vampires? Why don\u2019t I flip it a little and see what happens if it\u2019s Bella who has the bloodlust and the super-powers right from the beginning? And while I am at it, why don\u2019t I sell my fanfic to a publisher for a million dollars or so? After all, there are over 15 million people worldwide jonesing for a Twilight fix, so I might as well cash in while Smeyer is busy writing about An Alien Called Wanda. But here\u2019s the deal; this is not a badly written book. I would rate it slightly higher on technique than Twilight. And there are parts where the book gets positively interesting, before she ruins it altogether, but more on that later. Five reasons why Starcrossed is better than Twilight: 1. The love interest is a teenager the same age as the heroine. No immortal hundred-year old with an inexplicable penchant for cradle-snatching here! 2. Nobody falls in love with their food. 3. No love triangle (thus far!) 4. Greek mythology!!! (even fake Greek mythology is better than fake vampire lore) 5. Claire, the heroine\u2019s best friend, is an actual character, as opposed to a cardboard cutout like whatsherface Angela. (Although the constant references to her height and her fierceness and her hurriedly put-together chemistry with Jason were sort of boring.) Unfortunately, the unmistakable resemblance to Twilight sort of killed every other thought in my brain for the duration of this book. It\u2019s not just that the larger plot structure reminded me of Twilight; it\u2019s also very many, many small details. Like Helen\u2019s habit of hiding behind her hair. Like Helen\u2019s brand of awkward, insecure social interaction. Like how she logs on and Googles all the suspicious paranormal people stalking her. Like the fact that Helen\u2019s dad is a single father who spends most of the book watching sports on TV and being away on work at all the crucial times. Like the fact that Helen is so modest she can\u2019t change in front of another girl. Like the fact that Lucas has a loving, close-knit family with a sister who is a seer and can see the future. Like the fact that there is a scene with a car crash from which Lucas emerges unscathed. Like the fact that Lucas manages to sneak into her bedroom without her father knowing, and lies on top of the bedcovers while she lies under them; in fact there is one scene where she brushes her teeth in the bathroom and gets ready quickly for bed while Lucas is waiting for her in the bedroom, then goes to the head of the stairs and yells goodnight to her father, who is watching sport on TV. My memory may be at fault, but isn\u2019t there the EXACT. SAME. SCENE in Twilight? Also there are several points in the book where Angelini seems to be trying too hard to refute the fact that she is writing Twilight fanfic. There are references to stalker-ish men, and women who do what they\u2019re told because their men wanted them to, and both characters claim that they don\u2019t indulge in such behaviour. Helen\u2019s best friend is all like, oh you have superpowers, you must be a vampire. And then there are corny vampire jokes. The lady doth protest too much, methinks. The only thing this book has in common with the Percy Jackson series is that they are both vaguely based on Greek mythology. And Angelini twists the myths beyond recognition in an attempt to make them fit the parameters of the story. A simple Wiki search would tell her that Helen had no dealings with Aphrodite. And that Paris was the one caught in Aphrodite's clutches. Not to mention the fact Helen is directly descended from Zeus, owing nothing of her conception to Aphrodite. I'm not saying, read the Iliad, but at least read Wikipedia!! And all of her demi-gods are so super, super, SUPER speshul, with a vast array of supernatural knuckle dusters, that even the gods would have difficulty surpassing them! Wish fulfillment much? So anyway, I\u2019m breezing along, trying to get Robsten\u2019s faces out of my head, feeling my usual illicit thrill at the idea of star-crossed lovers, when I get to a point in the book that\u2019s actually sort of thrilling, and doesn\u2019t remind me of any other work of fiction. I start to think that maybe there\u2019s some hope for Angelini, after all. And then what does she do? (view spoiler) [She channels Cassandra Clare! Yes, Cassandra Clare! A fanfic tribute to the queen of fanfic? Aaaargh! Thankfully, she doesn\u2019t leave us, the readers, in suspense for long, even if her characters are going to be tortured for the next two books, at least! (hide spoiler) ] As if it\u2019s not enough that Zeus, the Furies and the Fates are conspiring to keep these two desperate lovers apart, she decided she needed to toss the kitchen sink at them as well! So why two stars? One star for the fact that the book is written moderately well and paces itself decently; one star for the fact that I get an illicit thrill out of the we-can-never-be-together, no-we-WILL-be-together-against-all-the-odds, i-will-mope-and-only-be-an-empty-shell-if-you-abandon-me plotline, despite the sneers from my saner, feminist alter ego! So if you hate Twilight and Twilight fanfic, or you know, badly-researched literature, stay away from this book. If you\u2019re a Twifan desperate for another dose, rush to the stores and pre-book your copy now! If you\u2019re like me and couldn\u2019t care less either way, well, we can band together and nitpick!

Lucas makes Edward Cullen look like the most complex character in the world. Lucas was a blank sheet of paper. Without even the college-ruled lines. Oh, yes. However, he did everything he could to make him look like the creepiest man in the world. 1. He stares at Helen. Typical of a creepy main hero. 2. He follows her around. To her house. The market. Anywhere. You name it, he's been there! 3. He tells other people to follow her around. 4. He tries to kill her, lmao. But it's just so romantic, though. Right? Plot: Silly and dull. Writing: Angelini's writing wasn't even there. Where was it? The sentences were simple and short. Imagery was a whole different concept to Angelini. Similes and metaphors? What are they?! And every once in a while, she would bring up a vague word that had nothing to do with the sentences at all. She didn't even seem like she knew what she was talking about. I do not know what happens in the next 200 and something pages I decided to not read. I don't even want to know. ...more --->WHAT THE HOLY GRENADE WAS THAT?! <--- A damn good book, that\u2019s what that was. ;) I am officially a Josephine Angelini fan, that\u2019s for sure.

At first I was kind of moaning about it (my GR friends can attest to that) but, then, as I got more and more into the topic and really finding out as much as I could in that time about Helen. Now, I am far from an expert in the subject; there are still so many opinions that I don't know about (but would really like to) but since I consider myself more well-versed than your average GR member, I will spend this whole review talking about how horribly wrong Angelini is about Helen and Paris' relationship. [image error] Seriously, peeps, this is a lot of research that I am going to include to enlighten you all. 1. How Angelini suggests that Helen and Paris, \"ran off together\" and abandoned both Trojans and Greeks like it was something incredibly romantic. First thing I'm going to address is that THEY DIDN'T FUCKING RUN AWAY ROMANTICALLY! As a little backstory to why Paris even found Helen in the first place was, one day, the three main goddesses (Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena) appeared to Paris while he was tending his sheep, for he was thought to be the most beautiful man in the world (and also the son of king Priam although he didn't know that yet) and asked him to tell them who was the most beautiful. Hera offered him power over many countries, Athena offered him wealth, and Aphrodite promised him the most beautiful woman in existence. Paris, being the exceptional man whore that he his, said Aphrodite was the most beautiful, and she promised him the then Helen of Sparta, then married to Menelaus and already with one child, Hermione. So, one month while Menelaus was out journeying, Paris came and took Helen, with help from Aphrodite. So, backstory over, one of the main ideas held by many artists like Primaticcio and scholars, both ancient and more recent is that Helen was fucking raped as she was taken away by Paris. Then an even bigger majority believe that if she did love Paris, it was because Aphrodite was controlling her emotions making her feel that way (she is the goddess of passion, after all). Some even say that Hera, being so miffed at Paris for not choosing her, sent Helen to live in Egypt for the duration of the war and gave Paris a fake Helen made out of clouds, just to provoke the whole war. One ancient philosopher, Sophocles, actually went so far as to go to Egypt and ask random Egyptians if Helen had been there, and they said yes, although that idea is one of the less well-known ones. Not very.....romantic, now is it? And even if Helen chose to go with him, they didn't \"run away\" and leave both of their peoples all romantically and such. They ran their asses back to big daddy Priam and let him protect them from the Acheans (also known as the Greeks) when they came to take back what was rightfully theirs. [image error] The art doesn't lie, folks. Oh, and the random nude woman is Aphrodite, making Helen go with Paris. 2. That female descendants of the half-bloods from the time of the Trojan war on are also super powerful, and that both sexes can fly and have spur speshul powers. That is, again, a bunch of shit. Not even the males had superpowers all of the time; they only were able to do mind-boggling feats when they were in the aristea (which, in a roundabout way means a scene of glory/ victory) where they put on some shiny armor, fight for a while, get injured, then the gods heal them and grant them strength then they kill an important enemy. They could not fly, they could not control the weather or anything of the sort, the half-blood men were just warriors. Especially the women back in Greek times; any woman who was born of a woman and a god was not even strong. She was just beautiful and that's about it. I know part of why that is is because of the sexist opinions back then, but that's the way it was written and told and that's the way I and Angelini have to and should take it. The only semi-important thing a woman could do back then was be an Oracle or be a priestess to a god/goddess. They were basically only seen as property for men; especially the beautiful ones like Helen. Nowhere in all of my research have I seen a woman or man who has been able to fly or control the weather; maybe if Angelini had laid it out better and used some actual facts then I could have accepted it, but she most obviously didn't, so I'm calling a major amount of bullshit on the whole idea. 3. That Helen and Paris had a \"great love\" and loved each other sooooooooooo much. [image error] Can ya detect the sarcasm? This is going to be the longest part of my rant review because this is the biggest most annoying statement that has ever been laid upon my ears. As I said earlier it is a widely known and accepted fact that Helen was forced by both Aphrodite and Paris to leave Menelaus and her daughter. Don't believe me? Here's a quote from the Helen herself as she talks about when the Greeks finally defeated Troy from The Odyssey, a thousand of years-old novel that is considered, along with The Iliad, one of the most important works of literature in early european history: The rest of the Trojan women shrilled their grief. Not I: / my heart leapt up--my heart had changed by now--I yearned / to sail back home again! I grieved too late for the madness / Aphrodite sent me, luring me there, far from my dear land, / forsaking my own child, my bridal bed, my husband too, / a man who lacked for neither brains nor beauty [image error] Notice how there's always a naked woman flying around in the background? It was Aphrodite, peeps. Still think that she may still like him? Well, here's a scene from The Iliad where she has even more wonderful things to say about Paris; this is where Aphrodite is trying to make Helen come have sex with Paris after he chickened out and left in the middle of a fight between Menelaus and himself: But why now?- because Menelaus has beaten your handsome Paris and hateful as I am, he longs to take me home? Is that why you beckon here beside me now with all the immortal cunning in your heart? Well, go to him yourself- you hover beside him! Abandon the gods' high road and be a mortal! Never set foot again on Mount Olympus, never!- Suffer for Paris, protect Paris, for eternity... until he makes you his wedded wife- that or his slave. Not I, I'll never go back again!\u201d Oh, and did I also fail to mention that Helen, when she does go to do it with Paris, and only because Aphrodite forces her, she outright says she wished that he had died on the battlefield? Do your damned research, Angelini Honestly, I don't blame the woman; Paris is just about the biggest douchebag in existence (at least that's one thing Angelini got right about Lucas' character). Before he had even taken Helen to be his wife he was about as close that you could be to love back in those days with a concubine named Oenone. On the day that Paris leaves to take Helen on his little secret mission, she comes to the docks and begins to cry in earnest and tells him that if he's injured, she will heal him. Let me tell you that kind of declaration was a big deal back in those days, and what does Paris do? As soon as he has Helen in his greedy little paws he basically \"dumps\" Oenone. In another scene in the Iliad, when Helen comes up to beg him to at least go fight the Greeks, he's sitting in a room with about ten other concubines, doing who the hell knows what with all of them. When he finds out that Helen had been having sex with one of his sons ( a lot of concubines= a lot of kids) he gets so enraged and jealous that he kills his own son. He has always been a coward as I have shown; he's the one that came up with the quote \"I'm a lover not a fighter\". But it comes to a point hat he would rather fight the most dangerous human on the planet at that time, Achilles, than be with Helen. Even when he's on his death bed, he doesn't allow Helen to choose her own husband and forces her to marry a man named Deiophobus. Yeah.....he sounds like such a controlling bastard loving fellow..... The closest that you will get to true love in almost any Greek fable is the story of Hector his wife Andromache, and their son Astyanax (which is kind of ironic because the Iliad was supposed to be all about the glory of the Greeks, but Homer makes us as readers sympathize a lot more with the Trojans than the Greeks). Andromache truly cares about her husband and child, and when he comes to check on them she begs him to not fight and stay with her and their son. Hector replies that he's only fighting because he doesn't want her to be sold into slavery; that's how much he values her has a person, and when he dies Andromache grieves horribly. She describes Hector's death as her own: Ilium only just now for you has fallen, for me it has fallen already, when the savage one (Achilles) drives his war chariot, my limbs had been dragged and the axle of Pelion (made from trees of Mt. Pelion, in Thessaly), trembling with Hector's heavy weight, was groaning with noise. Then [myself] having been overpowered and ruined, whatever has come to pass, I endure rigid and without emotion, being numbed by hardships. While Helen just sits around and hopes for someone to save her, and when they don't she has to stip herself naked in front of Menelaus just to keep him from gutting her on the spot, Andromache takes her husband's death and stays fierce. Threaten with flames wounds and dire arts of evil grief and starvation and savage thirst and varied plagues from all directions and iron thrusted in my internal organs, the plague of a dark prison, and whatever the victor dares in anger. Courageous mother admits no fears. And when they threatened to burn her husband's grave and throw his ashes over the ocean if she didn't tell them where Astyanax was, she refuses and tries to protect her son. Even when she's sold into prostitution she stays a staunch and proud woman throughout the rest of her life. In fact, Andromache is a straight up badass. I wish a story would have been written about her and not Helen. I wouldn't want Angelini to write it, but I still want one written. Honestly, now knowing what this whole story is about, I can't re-read this book without looking like a seizing cat: [image error] 'Nuff said. Er, shown. Whatever; you guys get my point. ...more This is a story of an impossible love and two people destined to repeat history... Wanna know who I loved most in the book?

What's different here is that all the main characters are descendants of Greek gods. They have special powers (when I say special powers I mean every damn possible power you can think of and then some you can't). A bit too perfect for a half-god, didn't like that part. There are pages and pages of rehashing Greek history (unfortunately for me, I know Greek history/mythology very well so I got bored at that part but oh well :D). Still, it was interesting, it really was :DD The story Helen is the most beautiful woman ever. And I mean Helen, a 16-17 (don't remember exactly but let's say teenager) girl who has known she was different for a long time. When a new family moves into her town, and she meets one of them, Helen gets overcome with the need to KILL that dude from that new family. Yes, it's hate at first sight, I love those and I loved it here too. It all has an explanation, one I'm not about to give you (ehehehehe), and eventually, Helen and Lucas fall in looooooove <3 What I loved here: Hector. OMG! He is the best part of this book, I can't say enough how much I loved EVERY scene with that guy. EVERY!!!! I would die of happiness if he was to get his own book <3 But then knowing how wonderfully Hector's fate ends, I don't have high hopes :(((( The Greek mythology and everything about it! I love GM and I loved it here, though at times the explanations were a bit overwhelming and too detailed. The whole concept of the book is great, different, and I really liked it. What I didn't like here: The main couple. Let me explain: I loved them in the first half of the book. Well, I loved Lucas *blushing* All the love/hate thing was great and all, I have to admit. But then, something happened near the end that really pissed me off, I was irritated and they all got on my nerves! All of them (except Hector of course <3 <3 <3). Helen. As someone who carries the whole series, she never warmed up to me, I didn't like her at all. She's lucky she had Lucas as other MC cause I liked them as couple (in the first half). The ending. It was stupid and unnecessary, the drama that happened in the end. Well it happened about 85% I think. It was so idiotic that I couldn't read anymore, I actually skimmed and read the last 15% in about 5 min. I admit, I am not dying to read the sequel :( Overall, the book was good at the beginning, great in the middle, but near the end I just couldn't stomach it :( So I'm somewhere in the middle with my rating as well. 3 stars for Starcrossed ...more I hate to say this but I am going to be tearing this one apart.

She and her father live alone and she has a job and a best friend, but something is coming. Something that will change Helen forever. Before she can even realize it the island is abuzz with news of the Delos family moving to the island. Helen begins to develop feelings of rage and unrest as she hears more about them. She begins to see visions of three women demanding blood. And, worse of all, the minute she meets the gorgeous Lucas Delos she tries attacks him. Is Helen going insane? And what does all of it mean? And, why oh why, should I care? I heard about this book over a year ago... all the book world has been waiting for it. \"It's Percy Jackson for high school girls! It's the new Twilight series!\" Blah, blah, blather. I was as excited as everyone else, but I'm over it. This book did so little for me. Part of the problem is in the writing itself. This is a debut novel and it shows. Angelini's writing is less of a fluid storytelling style and more of a disjointed spewing of every thought Helen (or rather Angelini) has as she goes along. I watched as paragraphs of random thoughts congealed together to form what is supposed to be a narrative and I wondered why the character was so ADD. Then it hit me; Percy was ADD and this book is trying to be exactly that. I can't help but feel that Angelini decided to smash two popular things together to try to make something new and failed miserably. I see that she loves Meyers. It shows. The writing is so similar. The problem is that no matter how much I (and everyone) loved Twilight (and the subsequent books) upon the initial reading there seems to be a universally agreed upon fact. Meyers, for all her success, is not a good writer. She's great at character development and in capturing the essence of Bella's spirit but not a great writer. We follow Bella because we identify so hard with her. Helen is no Bella. She's drippy and annoying and easy to disconnect from. I found nothing engaging about her. To mimic something in tone, and do it worse than Meyers, is a crime. To try to tailor it after something that is so universally loved is also a bad move. It's going to get weighed against and slaughtered if it fails. I didn't even make it through one hundred pages and I was tossing this down in annoyance. I didn't like the voice of the main character, the smashed together plot line (which I feel I've read before) and the direction it was going. It felt overly contrived, and I was not amused by it. The only thing I enjoyed about it was the setting. I'm not even the hardest core Meyers fan and I feel bad for her. In this case imitation is not flattery. The formula is way too similar. I feel even worse for Rick Riordan who shares a very like idea. This is an example of how his books could have been done if they were done. Very. Badly. I wish I had more reviews up to compare it with. I know others are going to love this, and it will sell a ton. However, I did not love it. I did not like it. I couldn't go on, and that is always a bad sign. 1 out of 5 stars. - review courtesy of www.bibliopunkkreads.com ...more This thing made me want to spit nails. Or throw a car. Something violent.

Not like that's suspicious or anything, but her mother Beth left when Helen was little, erasing all evidence that she ever existed besides Jerry's memories and Helen's necklace. There are two reasons why she could have done this: She's an FBI Most Wanted, or she's some freakish succubus that didn't feel the need to kill Jerry. 'Course, neither of those options are right, but, good try, right? Right. Then we have Helen's best friend Claire. Giggles. The second musketeer in this... *counts on fingers* ... eight musketeer adventure! She's the funny, quirky, loving sister that we can all depend on to have our backs when we need it most. Or can we? Claire is so lovely and caring that she pushed Helen off the roof of her house. Last time I hung out with my friends, we were seeing who could do the best Russian accent and squirting each other with Silly String in busy intersections. Not PUSHING EACH OTHER OUT WINDOWS AND STABBING OURSELVES TO SEE IF WE BLEED! Seriously, this is actually what Claire did to Helen in the book. Safety Tip #234 : If your best friend tries consistently to kill you, it's probably not a very healthy relationship. So maybe Helen doesn't have the best taste when choosing her friends, but come on. Claire only stabbed her to see if Helen would live or not. And she did! So that makes it okay, right? Right. Aside from Claire's path of carnage, there's also her other less-violent friends we have to worry about. Apparently Helen has quite a history with bad friendships! There's Gretchen. See, Gretchen was so loyal that, when Helen accidentally broke the bathroom door off it's hinges in 5th grade, she turned on her like the dark side of the moon and has held a grudge for... *counts off fingers again* ...six or seven years! We all need friends like that! Best Friend 1: You lost my hamster! Best Friend 2: I'm so so sorry! Your brother left the cage open and I swear I didn't know... Poor Snickers... Best Friend: I HATE YOU! I'M NEVER SPEAKING TO YOU AGAIN! I'M GOING TO SPREAD RUMORS ABOUT YOU IN HIGH SCHOOL YEARS FROM NOW AND DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO RUIN YOUR LIFE! SNICKERS WILL BE AVENGED !!! Yep, that just screams sisterly love! But not all of her friends are evil, maniacal, bloodthirsty fiends! I mean like, there's Matt! Matt is what we call a \"stage prop.\" He's there to make Helen look good, like she has normal human friends apart from her world of scions, but really doesn't do anything. Unless Angelini is planning something big for him in the next few books, he is absolutely useless. Then there's Zack. Or Zach. I forget and I'm not going to pick up that darned book again. I'll go with Zack because Zach makes me think of Zachary Moore and Zachary Moore is just too good to be put through that sort of thing.... Ahem. So, Zack, right. He's basically Helen's worst human enemy. Probably for no other reason than just because she's annoying, and if that's the case, I take his side. There's probably some long stupid story about their rivalry somewhere in the book, but if there was, it was too dumb and pointless to stick out in my memory. So in my mind, Zack is the only one that has the sense to slap Helen. Why do characters with the name Zack always have to be so awesome? I mean like, there's Zachary from Shade , Zack from Bitter End , Zack from Starcrossed.... Moving on from pathetic relationships! There are goddess-awful (heh heh, see what I did there? *smiles like a moron*) amounts of info-dumps in here, too. I'm someone who will openly say this: I don't get the whole Trojan War thing that much. I get some of the basics, but I don't know about all of the crap they're going on about in here. So when Ariadne has a four-page long explanation about Paris and Helen and the Wooden Horse and Troy and Wars and Aphrodite... Mind blown. Not in a good way. In a holy-crap-I-need-aspirin-for-my-headache way. Ouch. Needless to say we didn't study much Greek Mythology in school this year, so I don't understand a lot of what they're saying. I mean like, I'm not so lazy that I won't look up something I don't know anything about, but for this book, it doesn't seem worth it. If I read another book based on Greek Mythology that isn't terrible, we'll see. I'm not asking for her to spell out everything---I know who Zeus and Hades and Aphrodite and Poseidon and Persephone are and all, but I just stare dumbstruck at the pages where they start talking about random events in Greek Mythology that I've never heard off. She could at least have the courtesy to fill me in a bit. Stupid research. I'm going to be up all night on Google trying to sort out what the hades I just read. (sorry, couldn't resist.) Then there was Daphne/Beth. I wanted to slap that bitch so hard it would make her head spin. First of all, she disappears from her daughter's life. Then seventeen years later, she comes back, ties Helen up and drugs her, drags her away to a hotel, tells her she can never see her family or the Delos's ever again. Second of all, she convinces Helen and the Delos family to trust her, then coaxes Creon into letting her go, and gets (view spoiler) [Pandora (hide spoiler) ] killed in the process! Then, to wrap it all up and put a bow on top, she lies to Lucas and Helen and tells them that they're first cousins so she can ruin their only chance at happiness! YAAAAAAY! And Parenting Award of the Year goes to.... DAPHNE HAMILTON!!!!....or whatever her real last name is.... I'm too tired to remember and too stubborn to go check. Honestly, though, how did that discourage them from being together? After all the crazy chiz going on with murders and hitlists and unreliable homicidal friends, Helen's worried about being frowned upon? Give me a break! It's not like they're siblings! No one gives a chiz if they're cousins! The Delos family is used to them being together, so they don't care! Jerry doesn't even know! Helen is the only one complaining! Oh, and Helen complaining is not a fun thing to sit through. I swear if I have to read one more page of her catatonic nostalgia, I think I might just light the book on fire. Time for s'mores, children! Yum. All in all, this book has totally discouraged me from reading books based off of Greek Mythology. I know they all can't be that annoying, but I just... *shudders* But we all know that the first book is sometimes the hardest, because that's the one with all of the awkward introductions. The second's probably a lot better. I can pretend to be an optimist if I want to, right? Right.

I was devastated by what we learned and was told---there\u2019s no other way to describe it and I wanted to cry out in frustration. This book was incredible! Really, truly. It\u2019s very rare to find a book that manages to draw such a range of emotions from me. Josephine Angelini has created something amazing right here. I went through excitement, happiness, frustration, happiness again, shock, surprise, sadness and finally devastation.....devastation at how this book ended. I thought it was brilliant how she took the idea of demigods and Greek Myth and gave it a twist and direction that I\u2019ve never seen before! There is nothing out there like this! The storyline was marvellous. I was drawn in from the very first page by the characters and the idea and I just didn\u2019t want to stop reading. The idea of the modern day tragedy is alluring and appealing. You know it\u2019s going to lead to heartbreak, and yet you keep reading regardless--I love that! This book had a great cast of characters, Helen and Lucas obviously, but Hector, Jason, Arianne, Cassandra, Claire were all big draws for me. I love nothing more than when there\u2019s a great family dynamic within a book and this one sure had that! I admit I had my issues with Helen at the very beginning of this book. Although I thought she was a cool gal there was just something about he that didn\u2019t sit right with me. BUT as the story went on, I came to really love her. There\u2019s no denying she had her issues though. She had no idea who she was and she wanted to kill Lucas, which is a big no, no in my eyes, because....let\u2019s face it, he\u2019s Lucas (insert dreamy sigh here). I thought it was really nice to see how she approached everything and I never felt like she accepted things too easily, like I sometimes do in books. I think there\u2019s a lot in her though that could be subject to some growth in the next couple of books and I honestly look forward to seeing it. As for Mr. Lucas Delos....what can I say about him besides, \u201csqueee\u201d. Loved the guy! First I have to say that he reminded me of a certain vampire we all know *cough* Edward Cullen *cough* but not in a way that occasionally annoys me like in other books. I think he was similar in the way that they had the same personality traits and all, but Lucas had his own individual personality too. Lucas knew who is was and what he couldn\u2019t do. Sure he fought it and sure....he lost the fight with himself, but he still saw the consequences and was willing to fight for Helen---gotta love a man like that! He was wicked, with a sense of humour too and a serious side that just captivated me. I thought the romance between Helen and Lucas was beautiful. For once it wasn\u2019t one of those love-at-first-sight tales you always see. It was more hate-at-first-sight or kill-him-at-first-sight! Their relationship grew with time and wasn\u2019t in your face from the very beginning. It changed gradually and altered as they got to know each other and as they were drawn together. There was a chemistry and a spark between them and I can\u2019t wait to see how their relationship continues over the course of the series. Especially after the revelation that we shall never speak of..... *sob* I must say I adore Hector! For all his faults he\u2019s one of my faves in this series and he\u2019s got a special place in my heart. I love his mischievousness and his sometimes meanness (so what? He rocks anyway) and I hate what happened to him\u2014he does not deserve what he\u2019s going through. Claire and Jason cracked me up too. Seriously, like you can\u2019t tell straight away what all their bickering means and where it\u2019s heading--so cute! Can\u2019t wait to see more of them, they\u2019re gonna be firecrackers those two, I can totally see it. DAPHNE!!!! Grrrr! Sooo not liking that woman. After what she\u2019s done and continues to do, I\u2019d like nothing more than to beat her senseless (I know! Where does this violence come from inside me, I have no idea?\u201d) and I\u2019m wondering just what she\u2019s gonna do next. She wants to play nice and all that, but I don\u2019t trust her at all. And if Helen doesn\u2019t well, then I don\u2019t see how anyone can. Lots of surprises towards the end of this book. This chapter of the story seems like it\u2019s been summed up, what with Creon killed and everything out in the open (kinda). I am, and will continue to root for Helen and Lucas all the way through. It\u2019s just not fair that they found each other and can\u2019t be together. Seems like everywhere you turn nowadays in the book world are a pair of star crossed lovers, but there hasn\u2019t been a couple like this for a while. Josephine Angelini debut novel is beautiful, capturing and incredible. It\u2019s a story you start and don\u2019t want to stop. I have no issues what-so-ever with this books, except that technically it\u2019s not even out yet and I\u2019m DYING for the sequel already.

I kept, for the past two year, passing by it, at the library, and never actually borrowing it. Why? Well, I do like books with gorgeous covers but, this one, was too cheesy for me and the synopsis convinced me even more to not pick this book up. Although, I decided, those past few days, to try it because, obviously, this book has high ratings and is popular. I thought maybe, who knows, I\u2019ll enjoy it. I should trust my instincts more often. Sixteen years old Helen lives with her dad and goes to high school when, suddenly, the Delos family moves into the Nantucket island, where she lives, and she starts having those strange and scary nightmares. Whenever Lucas Delos and Helen look at each other, they feel this irresistible need to kill each other out. That part, I have to admit, what kind of interesting. Surprisingly, no insta-love! More like insta-hate! And so, Helen discovers she actually has special unbelievable abilities, as flying and that she\u2019s not the only one! I didn\u2019t really like the main character, Helen, because I truly couldn\u2019t connect with her! She was impulsive by moments and I couldn\u2019t stand how she obeyed Lucas\u2019 orders, especially in the scene in which she wanted to go grocery shopping and Lucas commended her to go back to her house and stay there. Lucas clearly liked to give orders and, if he ever gave one to me, I would not have obeyed! More like rebelled with all my heart. One thing I liked though was the mythology in it. Mythology books along with fairy tale retellings are my favourites. With mythology, come infinite possibilities. It was interesting and well explained. The characters had their own stories and I liked that! Just for the mythology, I would certainly be reading the sequels. I though the writing wasn\u2019t impressive, actually simple but good enough. The pacing was fast and I could understand why a lot of people enjoyed it. I embarked in the story but felt no connection with Helen and Lucas, and their love for each other. Maybe it was me, maybe it was the book, but I don\u2019t feel like buying this series. I believe this one to be a \u2018hit or miss\u2019 kind of book and so, I recommend you to see for yourself and not listen to this very personal review. Happy reading! ...more Greek Mythology! YAY!

I absolutely hated the initial pages of the book. Helen was insipid. Despite there being no clear description of her, I could tell that she was going to be another of those I-am-so-pretty-but-I-just-can't-see-it type of girl. Well, she is, and she is so typically Mary Sue, but upon a rereading, the entire book is so well-written and its portrayal of mythology so well-explained and creative that I am so glad I gave this another shot. I still have problems with Helen. She is so perfect, but her perfection, her typical way of underplaying herself and underestimating herself becomes a lot more understandable in the book as one goes along. That's where the book shines. In so many YA books these days, there are huge, gigantic, gaping plot holes, and I end up finishing the book with more questions than answers. This is not so with this book. Every question I had was explained, every complaint I had was addressed in a rational manner true to the book's imagined and actual mythological world. I can say overall that I have very few complaints with the characters besides the intrinsically perfect quality of the main character, Helen, and her equally perfect star-crossed love, Lucas. The plot is fairly confusing, but essentially the Delos family moves onto the Nantucket island where Helen and her single father has lived their whole life. Helen starts dreaming about wandering across a dry landscape, and has hallucinations of three women weeping. Her encounter with the Delos clan ends up disastrously, with the entire family and her locked in inexplicable hatred of each other. As they fight their predestined hate, the family and Helen get to know each other and seek to solve the mystery of Helen's true heritage. As I've stated, the beginning did not do it for me. From the first few pages, we get the impression that Helen attracts attention, although we never get a clear impression of how Helen looks from herself: Some of the Labor Day tourists were staring at her, not unusual, so Helen tried to turn her face away as subtly as she could. Helen is such a frustrating character, particularly in the beginning when we first get to know her. It's all Helen-Helen-Helen for the first part of the book. Helen goes to school. Helen talks to her friend. Helen talks to her teachers. Helen dreams, or rather, gets nightmares. What made this worse is that the impression she forms is not a very good one. She constantly downplays herself and her talents. She tries to play dumb in class so she won't attract attention, even if she's in need of a scholarship so she can attend college: her teachers notice this and calls her out on it, but all she has are weak, halfhearted excuses as to why she's not exerting herself or displaying her true intelligence. \"I think you're capable of much more than you are willing to admit,\" Hergie said, frowning. \"I know you aren't lazy, Helen. I also know you are one of the brightest students in your class. So what's keeping you from taking advantage of all that this educational system has to offer you?\" Even in track, she devalues her own performance, deliberately slowing down her true speed...and still she hopes to get by to college on an athletic scholarship. \"Coach Brant and I have noticed something interesting about your times, Helen. No matter who you're running against, no matter how fast or slow your opponents are, you always come in either second or third. How can that be? Do you have an answer?\" \"No. I don't know. I just run, okay? I try my best.\" \"No, you don't,\" Coach said harshly. And on, and on, and on, for the first part of the book. Helen is initially such a whiny martyr, getting cramps and being shy and reticent at attracting attention, She just wants to be left alone: \"Why couldn't they all just ignore her? Secretly, Helen had always felt she was different, but she thought she had done a pretty good job of hiding it her whole life.\" By this point, this early on in the book, I was on high Mary Sue alert. Then came the appearance of the Delos family and the Furies. I dislike anger and violence in this book, and this part gave me such a claustrophobic feeling. It's like being stuck in an elevator with someone clearly hiding some intense emotions like trying their best not to cry in public. It feels so awkward and frustrating and as much as you sympathize with them...you just want to get out of there ASAP. That's what it felt like with the inexplicable hatred and violence that the Delos family and Helen get when they're thrown together, and with Helen's violent and inexplicable emotions thrown into turbulence whenever she is in their presence. Later on in the book, Helen improves. She never becomes truly likeable to me, but it was explained clearly why she was the way she was. It was well-explained as to why she is special, why she holds so much value to the Delos family, and why she has all these special powers that she has. It is not intrinsic. The powers are given to her, she is not special for the sake of being special, and her reticence to shine and to show her true self, be it academically or athletically, stems from the mystery surrounding her heritage. And what a heritage. I loved the mystery surrounding her mother, and how it is gradually revealed, and why she is literally unable to let herself shine or be seen as intelligent or special by others. I did feel bad for Helen, having a mysterious mother who left her at birth. She grew up thinking that her mother hated her, and to be honest, the things revealed throughout the story kind of confirms that. I can't reveal the other things, but her name itself shows that her mother probably doesn't like her own daughter that much: the name Helen is rooted in Greek mythology as the woman who betrayed Troy, \"It's why we Scions never name our children after her. For us, naming your daughter Helen is like a Christian naming their child Judas.\" Ouch, and I thought naming your child hashtag was bad (true story, sadly). Actually, I think I'd rather be named Helen than hashtag, regardless of how much my mother hated me, it's better to have a name nobody will laugh at. As a character, Helen grows and matures realistically. She comes to realize how selfish she is, and how she needs to get her head out of the sand. \"Her life was also the only thing keeping the Olympians from coming back to earth and starting World War Whatever. So the Delos family had to protect her even if they all died doing it. And here she was refusing to learn how to fight. No wonder Hector hated her.\" Helen learns from her mistakes. The rest of the characters in the book were very well done. There is an enormous supporting cast; the Delos family are a giant clan, and their younger children all go to school with Helen and is subsequently involved in her training. Their sheer number and names (all Greek names, all fairly accurate except for Castor and Pallas. IT'S CASTOR AND POLLUX, DAMMIT) are overwhelming at first, but they all play a separate role and each character has their own personality. I ended up liking them all immensely. I love the fact that the girls in the Delos family are beautiful, stunning, smart, but also kind and never jealous of Helen. There's so much girl-on-girl hatred, especially towards beautiful girls out of jealousy and coming from beautiful queen bee mean girls in YA fiction that it is refreshing to meet the lovely creatures in this novel. Ariadne, Cassandra, and Pandora are kindhearted and warm, and as beautiful on the inside as they are physically stunning. They are the calming presences among the sea of adolescent male Delos testosterone. Lucas is rather too perfect for me to fully love. I liked his endless patience with Helen, the fact that they meet, recognize that their hate is controlled by destiny and by something beyond their control, and fight through it all despite their overwhelming antagonistic emotions. Once they get past that part, Lucas becomes a rather too-perfect guy for Helen. I feel like he enables her self-pity, and loves her so much to the extent that he can never see her flaws, although he does reach his breaking point eventually and tell her that she's got to get over her fear of herself and start fighting. Their insta-love is explained through mythology, and is understandable, although clich\u00e9d. Hector, for me, was a much more likeable character. He's somewhat of a rogue, he's got considerably more personality than Lucas, and I love that he sees Helen's flaws. He never treats her like a princess like Lucas does, and he calls Helen out on her bullshit whenever he sees it. When Helen is too scared to fight, because she is a pacifist, instead of insisting that he'll protect her as Lucas does, Hector kicks her ass and tells her not to be a wuss. He seriously trains Helen, and does not shy away from hurting her (she heals extremely rapidly, Hector is in no way needlessly abusive) if he feels she needs to learn how to seriously fight and defend herself. He is the one who stands his grounds and tell Helen to suck it up when everyone is pussyfooting around her. \"There are so many ways to kill a person, Helen. You think you're safe because you passed Cassandra's test with the sword, but you're not,\" Hector said, his voice thick with frustration and worry. \"I know you're still in shock, but I don't have time to wait for you to get comfortable with what you are. People are coming for you. You have to grow up, and you have to do it now or a lot of people are going to die. So go home. Eat something and get some rest. You look sick and I don't want Luke blaming that on me. But tomorrow you come to train. No more excuses.\" The explanation of how their family is related to Greek mythology is extremely well done. I had a lot of questions: why are they all so beautiful? Why are they all so talented? Why do the houses exist? All eventually answered, and so well-explained. I hate books with complicated schemes that end up digging a deeper hole for themselves for lack of a credible plot. This book is extremely well-written. Despite my initial hatred for the main character, I am so glad I revisited this book. I ended up loving it, and will continue to read the rest of the series. ...more THE BLURB: How do you defy destiny?

THE REVIEW: DAMN YOU JOSEPHINE ANGELINI HOW COULD YOU LEAVE IT LIKE THAT ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL PEOPLE HOW AM I EVEN SUPPOSED TO SLEEP TONIGHT YOU ARE EEEEEVIIIILLL...! *Pant, Pant* Okay, it's fine. I'm calm now. Suffice it to say, then, that STARCROSSED ends on a fairly huge cliffhanger. And anyone who knows me knows that I *do not* like cliffhangers. At all. I usually deduct a star from my rating of books that end this way, because it ruins my enjoyment to be left hanging like that. I also usually preface reviews of such books by saying: 'Don't pick this book up until the series/trilogy is complete'. But I can't do that in this case, because STARCROSSED is just. That. Good. STARCROSSED, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways: A beautifully thought out and cohesive mythic structure for the story to play out within? Check. A whole host of complex and wonderfully changeable characters who evolve and surprise the reader constantly throughout the story? Check. A well-paced plot which never quite twisted in the way I was expecting and which forced me to read the book literally in one sitting because I had to know What Happened Next? Check. Pared down, competent writing with some really lovely descriptive touches and a minimum of repetitiveness? Check. A strong, real, wonderful heroine who seemed like an actual person instead of a reader/author insert? Check. A hero who I could actually fall in love with instead of wanting to whack around the head with a two-by-four? CHECK! I think I've pretty much summed it up there, but let me delve a little bit deeper on some of my favourite points. First of all Helen, our protagonist in this story, is ridiculously beautiful. Yes, yes - yawn. And when I say that Helen doesn't really notice or care about her own beauty, you'll roll your eyes. But it's not like that. You see, Helen values other things about people than the way they look. She's been brought up by a rumpled, seemingly average, loving father who has taught her to look a little deeper than the average teenager. Helen doesn't walk around (as certain heroines do) bemoaning how ugly/normal/average she is despite the fact that everyone treats her like a hottie. She just DOESN'T CARE. And this fact does not win her any fans amongst her schoolmates, none of whom can quite believe that she doesn't know how gorgeous she is. But Helen has a great best friend and a wonderful support system within her family (her father and his co-worker Kate) and, frankly, too much attention gives her stomach cramps anyway, so she just shrugs it off. She's aware that she's a little stronger and faster than the people around her, but she wants to get on with her normal, human life, so she pushes that away too. When she first meets the gorgeous new boy in town (Lucas) and his gorgeous family, is she instantly smitten by how beautiful they are, and fancying herself in love? No way. Helen couldn't really care less about how people look. And she's got way more important stuff to worry about, like the nightmares and the fact that she's getting violent impulses towards Lucas and keeps wanting to strangle him. It's only after Lucas proves to Helen that he's worthy of her interest that she begins to develop feelings for him. Any guy who can sweetly reassure a girl and make her laugh after she has accidentally crushed his ribcage is A-O-flipping-Kay with Helen (and with me too). Helen gradually gains confidence throughout the book, tranforming from a shy, painfully diffident girl to one who can stand her ground and walk tall no matter what. Some of the book's most moving passages show her finally coming to accept and glory in how fast she can run, how hard she can push, and her various other talents (which, by the way? ARE AWESOME). At no point does she look in a mirror and realise 'Oh, I'm pretty!' She becomes more confident because she realises that she owns her own strength and power. How feminist is THAT? I love it! And because Helen is a strong character with her own opinions and viewpoint, her relationship with the too-hot-to-be-real Lucas is convincing and truly romantic. She's woman enough to stand up to him and not be overwhelmed by everything he can do. Even though he spends a lot of time teaching Helen and educating her about her powers, he never patronises her - or at least, when he shows signs of it, she slaps him down. Their affinity and deepening love for each other is wonderful. A quick shout-out must go to the secondary cast here. I love it when I feel as if each and every person in a story is nuanced and interesting enough to probably carry a book of her own, and STARCROSSED pulls that off and more. I adored how the author tricked me into believing I could tell which people were friends and which enemies, and then flipped it all on me. Hector is a great example of this. At the beginning of the story I was seriously hoping Helen would wrench his head off. By the end I was weeping quietly over his tragedy. Ah, Hector. *Sigh* A word of warning. For some reason I found the first chapter, maybe the first chapter and a half of STARCROSSED really hard to get into. I felt as if a little too much backstory was being pushed at me all at once. You may or may not experience this - but if so, push through it and I guarantee you will not be sorry. In closing - STARCROSSED is the book that has renewed my faith in the overcrowded paranormal genre. It's a heart-wrenchingly romantic action adventure story with strong characters and a breathless plot. The next book, DREAMLESS, cannot come too soon. ...more On one hand this book is without a doubt a direct rip off of Twilight . So many similarities not just in the setting and the characters but down to whole scenes such as Lucas spending the night in Helen's room with her father in the house and leaving in the morning by jumping out of the window. The only thing different was the characters' names. On the other hand it was still a very entertaining book with many likable characters and a fun, interesting story very loosely based on Greek mythology.

The beautiful people are descendants of the Greek gods instead of vampires but they are still super strong and fast and can do things like see into the future or fly or heal others. All a bit silly really but so much fun to read that I am still going to give it four stars:) ...more Starcrossed is not your typical girl meets boy they fall in love and defeat the bad guy together. No, it\u2019s much much MORE. I absolutely adored this book! I was left thinking about it long after I finished this enthralling story that entwines Greek mythology and modern day times so flawlessly and with such vivid accuracy I almost question if Ms. Angelini had witnessed the Gods-and all that that entails-herself.

No, it\u2019s much much MORE. I absolutely adored this book! I was left thinking about it long after I finished this enthralling story that entwines Greek mythology and modern day times so flawlessly and with such vivid accuracy I almost question if Ms. Angelini had witnessed the Gods-and all that that entails-herself. Helen has lived her entire life on Nantucket Island, she\u2019s always known she was different so she tries very hard to \u2018fly under the radar\u2019. This means never drawing attention to her unusual strength, speed or intelligence. Then the dreams come-acrid dry desert dreams that are so realistic she\u2019s actually parched when she wakes; when the dreams become even more realistic, Helen realizes that whatever is happening is real and out of her control. It\u2019s only when the very large Delos family moves in to Nantucket\u2019s largest most expensive home that Helen realizes why she\u2019s different. The entire Delos family is a mystery to Helen; at first she hates the very sound of their name, it\u2019s only when she sees Lucas Delos the first time and tries to kill him that she begins to come to terms with who or what she is. Danger now seems to lurk around every corner, if not from Helen herself then from others who want to capture or kill her. With the help of the Delos family, especially that of the gorgeous Lucas, Helen comes to terms with what she\u2019s capable of. For the first time, Helen is comfortable with who she is and who she loves. She knows true happiness for awhile, despite the danger lurking but with the arrival of a family member that has been missing from Helen\u2019s life for years, the danger increases and Helen\u2019s left with chaotic feelings that tear her apart. Will Helen make the right choices to protect those she loves or will she choose a different path altogether? This is such a complex story but to thoroughly review it would be to spoil it for the reader. What I can say is that I feel certain that this book will appeal to audiences of all ages and many genres. The brilliant weaving of Greek mythology with current times was dazzling-it was what I like to call -A One Sit Read- which is the highest of honors given by this reviewer. ...more Zu meiner Rezension: https://youtu.be/X-gkWJiT1JM WOW.

This makes the story even more flat and shallow and DULL. ...more Die Story ist super aber irgendwie hat die Perspektive mich oft verwirrt. Hat auch eine Zeit gedauert bis ich reingekommen bin. Werde bald aber auch weiterlesen. You know what? No. Fuck no! I think rating it 1 star is being extremely generous in this case. What the hell was this? I was warned several times that this book wasn't good, but, like always, I don't listen. I guess I like torture way too much. Oh, boy. Mother isn't going to be happy with that fact. Do I even have to explain why this book was terrible? Yes? Well, I know I'm writing a review, but do I really have to--? YES!! Okay, fine. Let's get this shit started. Shit, that felt good. PLOT: T-there was . . . You know what? No. Fuck no! I think rating it 1 star is being extremely generous in this case. What the hell was this? I was warned several times that this book wasn't good, but, like always, I don't listen. I guess I like torture way too much. Oh, boy. Mother isn't going to be happy with that fact. Do I even have to explain why this book was terrible? Yes? Well, I know I'm writing a review, but do I really have to--? YES!! Okay, fine. Let's get this shit started. Shit, that felt good. PLOT: T-there was . . . a plot? Are you fucking serious?!! (view spoiler) [Lupin: How did you know about Sirius and I? (hide spoiler) ] Saying that this book has a plot is like saying that The Last Airbender wasn't bad!! Here's what I got so far: Helen lives in Nantucket. Nantucket is boring. She lives with her dad, Jerry. A new clan of vampires people arrived. Everyone loves them. Helen almost kills one of them. His name was Lucas. After trying to kill each other, they date each other. Helen wants to sex him up. He says no. Helen is upset. Helen discovers that the Delos's family are descended from Greek gods and Helen is one too. They go into training. Helen gets more powers. Shit happens. MORE shit happens. Lucas and Helen can't be together because the Houses have to be separated. Groan. More groan. Daphne, Helen's mother, reappears. Daphne tells them that they're first cousins. \"You know what? This is gross. Incest, yuck!\" THE. FUCKING. END. The whole story was predictable and dragged on way too long. This book is almost 500 pages long, people! And nothing ever happens in there!! UUUUUUUUGGGGHHHHHH. I saw the plot twists coming and I was never impressed. Not. A. Bit. WRITING: Oh fuck, are you serious? The writing skills were amateurish at best! SHOW, DON'T TELL!! SHOOOWW, DAMMIT!! IT'S NOT SO HARD!! Basically, the sentences were too simple and its love for info-dumping was too extreme. And let's not forget its attempt at similes and metaphors. Oh, boy. but her insides felt gooey and soft, as if she were a freshly microwaved chocolate chip cookie. Helen ripped into the bread like a medieval glutton with low blood sugar. JUST LOOK AT THEM!! And the dialogue? Trying too hard. What teenager says \"What the holy grenade\"? TELL ME!! After several bad paragraphs (Which were a LOT), my head started to hurt and I was craving aspirins. ASPIRINS!! I HATE ASPIRINS!! And a drink. I'M UNDERAGE!! Even my eyes wanted to bleed because the writing was too painful. And did I mentioned the info-dumping? Angelini tried to stuffed all the Greek histories in short paragraphs, and guess what? I learned nothing. If you want to expand some Greek knowledge, this is not the right book. Apparently you have to learn the ENTIRE story before reading this. GAH. But, this is nothing compared to-- THE CHARACTERS: The main character is Helen Hamilton, the most beautiful girl in Nantucket. You know, kind of like Helen of Troy. Very subtle. Apparently, she's so SHY and AWKWARD and doesn't realize how beautiful she is. And she's clumsy. THAT'S SO ORIGINAL. And she's also a brainiac! Helen was made specifically to make the reader feel sympathy for her. Girls hate her because she's beautiful and every guy pays attention to her. The guys even call her Heaven Hamilton. No kidding. If you hate her, you're just jealous. And she has really super KEWL powers and gets stronger each chapter. She's the most powerful demi-god there was and nothing can kill her!! In other words, she's a Mary Sue. And an idiot. Oh, yes she is. And before she met Lucas, she's never have a boyfriend or been kissed. Because if she's not \"pure\", readers will think she's a whore that needs to die. Right. And even though she has super KEWL powers, she doesn't use them. You know why? \"Because killing enemies is so mean\". She is so damn useless. Why give her superpowers if she's not going to use them? She lets other people save her ass! I. DON'T. GET. IT. Useless, useless, useless! She is the definitely the worst YA heroine I've ever encountered. Sorry Bella Swan. And she's part of a prophecy where she will save the world. Yikes. Next we have Lucas Delos. He is so hot and every girl falls for him. Because he is so hot. And he has swimming-pool blue eyes. That's so creative. When he first met Helen, he wanted to kill her. And then they fall in love with each other. They can't live without each other! Co-Dependency for the win!! I didn't like him. At all. He orders Helen around (Even the quotations are marked as \"he ordered\") and gets horribly jealous when she talks to other people. \"Is Zach after you?\" Lucas asked with wide eyes. \"Oh, not really. He wants to talk to me about something, I think,\" Helen said as if it wasn't important. She shut her mouth before she could say too much. \"Yeah, I'll bet,\" Lucas said with a sneer, his blue eyes turning nearly black as he sensed her untruth. Is there any reason for Zach to think that you might be single?\" \"Are you trying to make me jealous or are you just so frustrated that you're already looking for someone else? Someone who would give in to you?\" And this is before they were dating!! Basically, Lucas kept saying no to Helen, but is is suddenly a tragedy if Helen wants to be with somebody else. FUCK THAT. WHY THE FUCK DO YOU CARE??! And he threatened to rape her at one point. Only because she wore a certain type of pajama. \"I only have so much willpower, Helen. And since you apparently sleep in the most ridiculously transparent tank top I've ever seen, I'm going to have to ask you to get under the covers before I do something stupid.\" Translation: \"If I force myself in you it will be your fault because you tempted me with your transparent nightgown.\" This behavior is not okay. Being in a relationship is supposed to feel safe. When your boyfriend is threatening to rape you, you BREAK UP WITH HIM. What will happen then when you're completely alone? Hmm? Nobody deserves to feel used in a relationship. And he likes to panic Helen on purpose! Look! \"You're pretty cute when you panic,\" he said with a huge smile. Because it is so cute when guys make you fear for your life for their enjoyment. In other words, Lucas attitude toward Helen is like this: \"I know we can't be together, but I'm still going to order you around. Now go to sleep, you inexperienced woman.\" I can't. And if Helen dares to lose her virginity to another guy, Lucas will kill that guy! Ah, true love. Oh, and here's the kicker: He watches Helen sleep. Can writers please get it through their heads that stalking isn't romantic? Look, just because Twilight did it, it doesn't mean that people will find that attractive. And if they do, they have serious problems. Is this the guy women really want? An arrogant, creepy, abusive love interest with the excuse of having good looks? *checks the best-selling list* But of course they do. And apparently he switches places with Hector to watch her. GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!! The Delos family: Let's just say that they're kind of like the Cullen clan. Minor characters: Claire, Helen's best friend, who always tries to prove that she is right so (view spoiler) [she pushed and stabbed Helen just to see if she had powers. (hide spoiler) ] ; Matt, Helen's other best friend; Zach, guy that suspects that Helen is hiding something; and Gretchen, the girl that ruined Helen's reputation because she accidentally pushed the bathroom door while she was in it by accident. And she still hasn't get over it after 7 years. We have the most fascinating and complex characters in the history of literature right here! Sigh. VILLAINS: Just pathetic. We have Creon who pretty does nothing until the end. He spends the majority of the novel staying in Spain, longing for Helen. That's right. He lusts after Helen, too. That's not cliched at all! And he says crap like: A lady never cheapened herself by using foul language He had sworn to remove the feminine evil from the cestus from the world so that all men, Scions and normals alike , could finally control their lust. FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU, A THOUSAND TIMES FUCK YOU!!! How can people still have this primitive mindset about women? And a WOMAN wrote this! A WOMAN! How can we still think that women are to blame for men's actions? How can we still degrade women by the way the talk, dress, or act? This is disgusting and unacceptable. I know the villain said that, but it is perfectly clear by the way it is written that this message is being preached. I'll talk about the message later. Then, we have Daphne Atreus, Helen's mother. Short story short, she abandoned Helen when she was a baby and cursed her. And then she suddenly appears in her life just to lie to her and Lucas that they're cousins. How pathetic is that? She was a really annoying villain and I wanted her to disappear. Then, those two (view spoiler) [kill Pandora (hide spoiler) ] and Hector (view spoiler) [ kills Creon, making him an Outcast (hide spoiler) ] . I hope Daphne gets her turn. WHAT STARCROSSED PREACHED TAUGHT US (WARNING: I don't mean to offend anyone with this. I'm just mocking the book's message.): Hey girls! Did you know that if two boys fight over you, it is all your fault and deserve to be hated if those two get in trouble? Silly girl, didn't you know that men are never responsible for their own actions? And if you try to fight back, you're wasting your time. You're a woman, you always want drama in your life. If you're beautiful, girls will hate you because us girls are jealous harpies that want all the attention to ourselves. And you know what? Let's all make fun of domestic abuse! Ha ha, look at her! She obviously liked being beaten up! Can't you see how much she enjoyed it? You know what? Since it is so funny, let's all pretend to be in an abusive relationship to justify your bruises to your parents! That will be a very funny family reunion. I'll just tell him [Jerry] you abuse me,\" Helen said with a shrug. \"And I'll tell him you like it,\" he teased back. And you want to fight? *dope slap* Silly woman! Don't you realize that men do all the fighting and you're supposed to stay in the kitchen? If you want to fight, do it to stay in shape! You're supposed to be feminine and round! No men likes a strong woman! Everything about Ariadne was so feminine and round and lovely that Helen simply couldn't imagine anyone hitting her. \"Do you guys do this to each other often? The fighting, I mean.\" Ariadne was shaking her head before Helen had even finished talking. \"No. We spar together to stay in shape, but only the boys really fight, and only when they need to get something off their chests.\" Your boyfriend orders you around? He's doing it for your own good and he loves you! That means he really cares about you! Don't worry if he tries to rape you. He's your boyfriend and you're suppose to do what he says! Besides, it's not rape if you like it. And please don't curse! You're a lady, not a tomboy! Being watched while asleep is so romantic. Never questioned it. He's doing it for your own good. And if a guy rapes you, it is all your fault. Why can't you be more careful with your clothes? Look at your skirt! No wonder their penises couldn't contain themselves. *dope slap* Silly woman. And oh my goodness! The guy you liked is gay ? You know there's a solution for that, right? It's called getting a sex change. She decided that if Lucas was gay then she was going to have to get a sex change operation. He would be so worth it. You may live happily ever after. And EW! You're trying to have a life outside your relationship? Why do you hate him so much? You're supposed to depend on your boyfriend! That's real love, you silly woman! You're not supposed to have a mind of your own, your boyfriend IS your mind. And OMG what are you doing? Are you trying to have sex? BOO! YOU WHORE! You're supposed to lose your virginity to your husband and no one else. Wait, you love that guy? Screw you, silly woman! You deserved to be left behind when he's done with you! Don't you realize that men don't want a woman who has been deflowered? That's right, ladies. Your virginity is all you have. Without it, you're a big whore who deserves to die a painful death. (view spoiler) [This book ends up being about Helen's virginity. What a surprise. (hide spoiler) ] In other words, FUCK THIS BOOK!!!!! PLOT TWIST: It's all a lie. Helen and Lucas believe that they're cousins and they suddenly stop loving each other. Huh. I guess the thrill is gone. It is legal to marry your cousin in some states. Problem solved! Oh yeah, I forgot. Fucking your cousin is disgusting. The stupid thing is, they're not related at all! This conflict is utterly useless. UUUUUGH. ANY POSITIVE QUALITIES? Hector. That is all. I could go and on, but enough is enough. This book blows. It's shit. Crap. Garbage. IT FREAKING SUCKS. Nothing more than a preachy, sexist book. And it has a sequel!

Qualcuno me lo spieghi perch\u00e9 io sto ancora cercando di capire questa maledetta trama ricca di MITI GRECI messi la' a caso??? In un nanosecondo ho visto la \"mitologia\" cedere il posto ad un \"amore\" da voltastomaco, a personaggi banali, stupidi, perfettamente ridicoli. E non voglio continuare perch\u00e9 il mio repertorio di aggettivi negativi risulta essere abbastanza limitato dopo che il mio cervello ha subito una bella spremuta per sopportare le ultime pagine di questo libro. Pagine che ho saltato senza sentirmi minimamente in colpa! La trovata mitologica poteva essere straordinaria, ma questa autrice non \u00e8 riuscita nel suo intento. Per nulla! Solo il finale fa ridere... piangere... ma che diavolo di finale \u00e8??? Neppure un bambino di tre anni riuscirebbe a scrivere un finale cos\u00ec privo di emozioni. \"Buongiorno Lucas\" disse lei, la voce bassa e triste mentre si allontanava. \"Buongiorno Helen\" rispose lui, senza avere l'ardire di girarsi a guardarla. Helen, LA PREDILETTA DALLA DEA DELL'AMORE, scese le scale per infilarsi a letto mentre Lucas, IL FIGLIO DEL SOLE, si appoggiava ai gomiti e guardava il suo dio-padre illuminare le assi di legno di quella piccola terrazza. Cosa stavi fumando??? Dimmelo che vorrei procurarmelo anche io... forse cos\u00ec riuscirei a stordire la mente e trovare questo finale e l'intero testo accettabile!

Ho sperato con tutto il cuore prima di iniziare a saltare le pagine che potessi migliorare, maturare, migliorare... ma nulla, sei rimasta una cretina! Poi dopo aver messo da parte il tuo desiderio mortale - RIDICOLO - di voler eliminare il belloccio della scuola, semi-dio, perfetto, ricco bla bla bla bla... ecco che tutto si trasforma in amore a seconda vista. Ed \u00e8 tutto un fuoco... si perch\u00e9 improvvisamente ti trasformi in questa ragazzina sciocca, che gi\u00e0 eri, infuocata dalle fiamme della passione e dell'amore! Come la tua antenata Elena!

Can you... Sense a pattern? The writing felt clumsy (I think the author used the word \"cunning\" 3 times in 5 pages) and very deliberate at times. I would read something, a tiny detail, and it was written in such a way that I knew it would be a big part of the plot later. And I hate obvious fore-shadowing. I also felt like the author wanted Helen to come off as strong. And, well... \"Helen nodded submissively.\" \"His gaze had such a positive impact on her that she felt unbalanced as soon as his eyes abandoned her.\" It's a shame, because this novel had a lot of potential. I love the plot and really enjoyed the mythological aspect (quite an original take on the Trojan war and the gods in general) and would have loved to see it crafted with more subtlety and skills. The romance, although kind of out of the blue (I love watching relationships develop - I'm not a fan of instant attraction), had this kind of je ne sais quoi (again, like freaking Twilight) that made me keep going. I think if Helen and Lucas were less co-dependent, the whole thing would work a lot better. To sum it up, I think the series has a lot of possibility if the writing gets better. This book is a debut, so I haven't given up hope. I'll probably pick up the sequel whenever it comes out. ...more", "Title": "Starcrossed"},
