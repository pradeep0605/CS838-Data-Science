I was very disappointed indeed. Since a lot of other people seem to have liked it, it may just be a matter of taste, but... The characters are two-dimensional cliches that can't tie their own shoelaces, except for the daringly deductive Dexter, who *can* tie his own shoelaces. Which makes him a genius. I recall seeing someone else comment that <+++>Darkly Dreaming Dexter</+++> needs to \"show, don't tell.\" Dexter's interior monologue *tells* the reader about his code, and how careful he is, yet with one exception he's clumsy and messy throughout the book. I found the authorial voice to not be \"darkly humorous,\" but frequently silly and always snidely sarcastic. The interior monologue harps constantly on the same few themes, especially his lack of emotions and the crippling stupidity of every living being in Miami. It quite fails to function as a mystery; at no time does anyone successfully piece together evidence or clues to get closer to catching the offscreen serial killer the book focuses on. The obvious exception is when Dexter the genius follows psychic visions and prophetic dreams (<---B>\"intuition,\" presumably</---B>) to where the killer predicts they will meet. Any actual plot development happens at the very beginning and very end of the book, with the intervening chapters basically being nothing but red herrings and Dexter watching police be stupid. At one point Dexter's sister Deb, a police officer, comes to a correct conclusion before Dexter. He immediately tells her that she is right \"for all the wrong reasons,\" which is blatantly untrue and (presumably) only there to make him sound smarter. While I had a pretty good idea of how the end would turn out, having seen the first two seasons of the TV series, I was shocked at how little foreshadowing or fanfare there was of the big revelations. The deus ex machina leads Dexter to where he needs to go, things happen in a hurry, book ends with an epilogue -- half of which is written to be super-vague so as to build suspense about which characters lived or died. For a moment, having finished, I was curious enough about the development of the only potentially interesting plot thread at the end of the book to consider reading the second. I think I'll just find a synopsis on the web to see if it's developed at all in future books. On reflection, I am very impressed with the television show's producers' ability to pick out the nuggets of greatness buried in the book and make something so wonderful out of them. ...more I'm a BIG fan of the Dexter TV show on Showtime. This led to me being a bit hesitant to read the novels because I was worried about a serious case of disappointment. Michael C.

Well, turns out that my fears were groundless. The characterization of Dexter was excellent and I found myself engaged by him from the outset. The novel tracks the first series of the show closely and in many way it was like re-watching the first season with some nice additional details added. The plot is fast-paced and tightly focused and the characters are well-drawn. In sum, an excellent read. 3.5 stars. Recommended. P.S. For audio listeners, the audio version of this was well done. The narrator, Nick Landrum, did a good job, most notably with Dexter, and enhanced the story experience. ...more This review is brought to you by the letter D.

Dexter Morgan is a blood spatter pattern analyst for the Miami-Dade Police Department, but in his spare time he enjoys boating, eating donuts, spending time with his foster sister Deborah, playing with his girlfriend Rita's children...oh and killing people. Dexter lives by a code, \"The Code of Harry\". Before Harry Morgan -Dexter's foster father- died, he taught his son to only kill people who have gotten away with murder as a way to channel his homicidal urges. Dexter manages his double life without incident until The \"Tamiami Slasher\" starts murdering prostitutes in the Miami area. He feels a connection to this killer, and this connection could be his undoing. I read DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER before the TV series started, and thought it was quite a refreshing and new take on the whole serial killer theme based novel. I very rarely like books from the point of view of a serial killer but Dexter is quite different. I didn't mind being in his head one little bit. Once the TV series started I got so caught up in it, that I left behind the books and decided that one day when it was all done I would go back to them. I am so glad I waited! It was even more entertaining the second time around. Kudos to the brilliant casting director of Showtime's Dexter for giving me outstanding faces to put to the characters- They were even better than my imagination could conjure up the first time around. ...more Getting in mind of Dexter is never boring his insight is funny and his technique of killing is masterful.Dexter talks of his beginnings, of his first kill, the day his dark passenger became the rider. Recollections of the past with his father Harry and his deadly advice, its a good fast read in the rambling mind of a sociopath Dexter. I read this series of books because I was so taken by the Showtime series. And you know what? I liked the TV show better ! The books are good, and it's fun to get \"inside the mind\" of Dexter, but because the plot of the book follows pretty closely to the first season of the TV show, it was hard not to make comparisons.

Spoilers below, so don't continue reading if you don't want to know what happens! A few things that I thought the TV show did a lot better was the whole \"flirting with another killer\" plotline. In the books as in the TV show, Dexter is absolutely enthralled by this other killer's method of draining the bodies of blood, and recognizes that the killer is communicating with him. However, in the books the killer goes largely absent from the plot, where in the TV show he shows up as Dexter's foster sister's boyfriend. Which is just marvelous - it reveals him to be just THAT much more creepy, that he can have that COMPLETE of a mask. And it makes so much more sense on the TV show that he's Dexter's brother. We're gifted with a lot more of Dexter's flashbacks and his aversion to blood than in the books, if you can believe that. In the book it feels like, \"Oh hey, you're my brother? Neat.\" where in the TV show it's much more shocking, much more of a draw for Dexter to follow along in his brother's footsteps, and join him in killing indescriminantly. And, therefore, much more important for the character when in the TV show he kills his brother. In the book, he lets his brother go (presumably to show up again in some later installment). Also in the book, he almost kills is foster sister... so now, she KNOWS that he's a \"monster\". On the TV show, NO ONE knows. It makes him that much more of a lonely hero, of sorts. And I just find it incredibly unrealistic that a cop sister who finds out her brother is a murderer would just accept that fact and move on. ...more Mysteries and Thrillers are often hit-or-miss for me. I have had the good fortune of being recommended a lot of writings from the creme de la creme of this genre by my father, so grew up ingesting PD James, John le Carre, and Dennis Lehane with the pulp sci-fi that was my fare of choice. I have also, at times, been forced to read a James Patterson or John Grisham for lack of any other reading materials. This has given me a broad exposure to what could arguably be called the most popular genre in Mysteries and Thrillers are often hit-or-miss for me.

I have also, at times, been forced to read a James Patterson or John Grisham for lack of any other reading materials. This has given me a broad exposure to what could arguably be called the most popular genre in the US. So believe me when I say that I have never read a murder mystery of the caliber of \"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\". Dexter Morgan is a serial killer of a far different variety. After his foster father Harry realized the killer lurking within Dexter, he set out to use all of his years of experience as the top investigator in Miami Homicide to make Dexter the most cunning and wily serial killer possible before sending him after his victims- the criminals and killers who slip through the cracks of the self-same justice system that now employs Dexter as a blood spatter expert. So Dexter is a serial killer who hunts serial killers. Does this sound like an interesting premise yet? Lindsay paces the story beautifully and keeps the reader as confused as Dexter is when bodies start appearing that seem as though they could have been done Dexter himself- if not for the fact that the bodies are of murdered prostitutes, innocents which are expressly against the Code of Harry. Is Dexter losing control of his inner beast? Or is there another killer out there with deeply personal knowledge of Dexter and his methods? After finishing this book I had to pop on-line right after to order the sequel. It's just that good. ...more I'm a very neat monster.

If you liked the show, you'll like this book too. ...more Dexter is a serial killer, a killer who just can't help himself. He doesn't even see himself as human. But he does have something of a conscience and lives by the Code of Harry, his cop foster father, who understood his nature and sought to help Dexter control it somewhat when he was a teenager. Now a blood spatter analyst for Miami police, he's brought in on gruesome murder cases and a new serial killer in the city has Dexter feeling inspired, flattered and awestruck - and frightened that it's Dexter is a serial killer, a killer who just can't help himself. He doesn't even see himself as human. But he does have something of a conscience and lives by the Code of Harry, his cop foster father, who understood his nature and sought to help Dexter control it somewhat when he was a teenager. Now a blood spatter analyst for Miami police, he's brought in on gruesome murder cases and a new serial killer in the city has Dexter feeling inspired, flattered and awestruck - and frightened that it's really him, doing the killings in his sleep. His sister Deborah is a cop trying to move her way up but reduced to posing as a hooker to catch curb crawlers, and what with Dexter's \"hunches\" about murderers, gets him to help her on the case. Yet he's ambivalent - he so admires this killer's work, does he really want to see it end? He'd rather play, and since the killer has been sending him messages through the way the dead bodies are displayed, he's drawn into a fascinating game with deadly consequences. I have to say, Dexter is one of the most engaging and interesting - and understandable , perverse as it may be - anti-heroes I've ever read. He's not right in the head and he knows it, he spends a great deal of effort pretending to be human, and ordinary, yet because he only goes after sick bastards like child-molesting priests and the like, you can't help but appreciate his vigilante efforts - though what he does to his victims is far from a quick and easy death. It's a combination of his macabre humour - this book is really quite funny - the characters and his observations of them, and his narrative voice: so effortless, so calm, seeing a perspective and an angle to people that non-sociopaths (is that the right word?) would not see so well. He thinks like a killer, yet still comes across as somewhat naive and innocent. He's not at all interested in sex or women, so his disguise as \"boyfriend\" shows this \"innocence\" well: And if her uncertain, limping tone of voice, unlike any I had ever heard her use before, was a surprise, imagine how astonished I was by her costume. I believe the thing was called a peignoir; or possibly it was a negligee, since it certainly was negligible as far as the amount of fabric used in its construction was concerned. Whatever the correct name, she was certainly wearing it. And as bizarre as the idea was, I believe the costume was aimed at me. (p.154) His childlike wonder and appreciation for the way the other killer is slicing up bodies and arranging them also gives him some kind of ... childlike quality. It's hard to find the right adjective for Dexter: he's a complicated character, because he's all grey, despite being very clearly a serial killer. There's no attempt to gloss over that , or excuse him. Yet was there ever a more fascinating and affable murderer? He's not even creepy - now that's an achievement! And because it's not in the least sexual, he's not creepy in that way either. On the contrary, even though you know he can't really function normally, you want him to be happy. He's a bit Batman-ish, in a nerdy way, the dark avenger or something silly like that. Regardless, he's likeable and even sympathetic; but more necessary to the reading experience: he's a wonderful narrator with a thing for alliteration - namely with the letter D; truly, he's very inventive. I don't like mass market crime books, I loathe Patricia Cornwall, John Grisham is exceedingly dull, and I couldn't even finish P.D. James' The Lighthouse because I was so bored - the problem with your typical crime book is the lack of characterisation. There's plenty of that here, in fact, it's all about the characters. There's still plot, though, and a mystery, which you can figure out somewhat before Dexter does, but it all hinges on the characters. I thought the Epilogue was too rushed, and the relationship resolution between Dexter and Deborah too pat, but they're minor quibbles. I'm keen to read the next book, Dearly Devoted Dexter , and there's a third coming out in September. ...more Firstly I have never seen the show. Not once, not a single episode.

It felt like it was there just because the author couldn't think of a clever way of getting Dexter to the crime scenes, etc. And it gave away the killers identity far too easily. It mentions how Dexter is supposedly brilliant but there was nothing in the book to substantiate that. He just kind of stumbled through it all.

The final season of the Showtime series was such a disappointment that it is offensive to most fans of the show. I prefer to imagine a world without Dexter Season 8, so I'm rereading the novels. I haven't read the two newest books, Double Dexter and Dexter's Final Cut , and I haven't listened to the audio books at all. Let the journey begin! Note on the narration: I love books narrated by their authors. This one is no different. <---A>Jeff Lindsay</---A> does a fantastic job. In fact, the book (story) itself gets three stars, while the narration gets five. Thus we have the four stars you see above. In summation: Fans of the show will find a hell of a surprise at the end of this book, as I was shocked to see certain characters living past season one of the Showtime series. I say this because there are quite a few people out there who say, \"I've seen the movie/television show. Why should I read the book?\" Well, this time around, they are very different. At least at the end they are. To say anything else would be to give up massive spoilers. Final Judgment: Different is as different does. ...more Oh Moon, glorious Moon --- Why did'nt I pick this up when it was first released is beyond me! I love Dexter and his Dark Passenger.

Also, when dealing with that \"genius serial killer\" cliche, one has to be really careful, since it is a cliche and all. Making reference to the fact that Dexter likes Phillip Glass?

If anyone really doesn't know, it's a series on Showtime with this wonderfully creepy intro. ) So I picked up Darkly Dreaming Dexter with more than a little trepidation. After all, as an avid reader, I am usually that pissed off person fuming that Hollywood makes too many unnecessary changes when transforming a book to either the big or little screen. Once in a blue moon the movie adds depth to a novel, but more often than not, the changes seem to be for the worse. In fact, the only instance I can recall thinking that the movie and book complement each other is A Clockwork Orange . But, I digress. Darkly Dreaming Dexter is the story of Dexter Morgan, serial killer. With a conscience. Sort of. Dexter was adopted and raised by Harry Morgan, a Miami cop. When Dexter was still young Harry noticed signs that he may be troubled but felt that he was a good kid nonetheless. So, Harry instructed Dexter to live life according to a rigid code. Essentially, he taught Dexter how to channel his urge to kill into only going after bad guys, and he also taught him how to avoid being caught. The book takes place when Dexter is twenty eight, and has been enjoying the life of an unknown serial killer for about ten years. This book is really an introduction to Dexter, his life, and his ways. At first, I loved it. Loved Dexter's stoicism. Loved that in print he is one hundred times more creepy and detached than he is on the show. Although the supporting characters do not play a very large role in the book (so far, at least) it was interesting to see them through author Jeff Lindsay's eyes. But as the book continued, it became...strange. There is a serial killer on the loose. Although Miami homicide is stumped, Dexter feels a kinship with the killer. Is it because he, too is a serial killer and knows how they think? Or is it an unexplained psychic bond with the killer? (view spoiler) [ It's both! (hide spoiler) ] The title, Darkly Dreaming Dexter, refers quite literally to Dexter's dark dreams. It will be interesting if this angle is more fully explored in future books. However, as they are introduced in this book, they come across as poorly explained vaguely paranormal filler. In addition, when the climax of the story was reached, and the good(?) guys were in direct confrontation with the bad(?) guys it simply... ended. The next chapter was at least a few days later. Wha-what? Lindsay reveals the basics of what happened, but not the details. Frankly, I felt that this was a cheap trick. As if he knew how to create a mess, but not how to get his characters out of it. That alone is such a poor writing trick that it lowered this rating from four stars to three. I can't say that this is a novel I wholeheartedly recommend. If I were to read it as a standalone book, having never seen the television show... I'm not sure how well I would like it. Dexter is a complex and fascinating guy, no doubt. And Lindsay deserves kudos for coming up with the concept. Unfortunately the written execution of Dexter and his story leave a little to be desired. Dexter does the emotionless sociopath thing just a little too well here. There simply isn't any character development. However, maybe there will be changes in book two? After all, I know where the show is going and what is in store for Dexter. Although there are some huge differences between the show and the book, (as in life and death differences) (view spoiler) [ ha! I'm not gonna tell you here ~ read for yourself ;) (hide spoiler) ] the show being based on the novels lead me to believe that they both are headed in the same general direction. Or not :) I guess I will find out because despite my love/disappointment with this novel, the show ended on one heck of a fucking cliffhanger this season. Hopefully reading these books during the offseason will sate my Dexter obsession until next September! ...more Brilliant! What a character to adore: so fresh, crazy, ironic, scathing...

As usual, I think I like the book (at least the first one) even better! You really get inside Dexter's head in the book since it is entirely told from his perspective with his mental commentary splashed throughout. He really does have quite the sense of humor. I'm glad I decided to try out the book, and I cannot wait to read the others as well. Dude. Best serial killer book I've read in a while. Funny, creepy, yet not horrifying in the way that American Psycho is.

I'll admit I first picked up this book because I want to watch the Showtime series, and I'm a book-before-movie kinda gal. (Everyone at work is watching the show, and I want to be one of the Cool Kids.) Therefore, Michael C. Hall's face and voice were very much in my head the whole time. Doesn't matter. Dexter is, well. Dexter. Deeply distinctive Dexter. Detached drama queen Dexter. Devilishly droll Dexter. One of the best first person narrations I've read in a long time, and I think the author does a v. good job of being internally consistent with Dexter. In many ways, mysteries rely on deeply human motivations, passions, emotions, etc., which the author has deliberately removed from Dexter. What delights me about this book is how the author still manages to fit Dexter into that paradigm without giving Dexter a sudden fit of human compassion. The rules are the rules from the beginning to the end, and there's no wavering. SPOILERS BELOW Ultimately, you can't have Dexter kill Deborah and a) have most readers not throw the book across the room and 2) not kill all his funny with real, legitimate creepy. I quite like the perfect little deadly diorama (couldn't think of a third D word) at the end, with the dichotomy (ha!) between Dexter's siblings, between nature and nurture if you will, between Dexter's creepy and Dexter's funny. It's a very fine balance between the two, setting up Dexter's serial killeritude and keeping him relatable enough to a) be a sympathetic character and 2) fit within the shape of a mystery novel and not just have Dexter go, \"Wheeee!\" and kill everyone. I do wish that there was a bit more plausibility to the idea that Dexter himself could be committing the murders, but I'm not sure how you do that and still tell the story. The whole following-the-van bit pretty much negated the possibility that Dexter was doing it for me, so that element of mystery felt a bit overplayed to me. I like that Brian came out of nowhere, that it was not unsurprising that Dexter's Mysterious Past was involved in some way, but the way in which Dexter really was the focus of it all was unexpected. The gun was on the mantle, but it was only tangentially referenced, and you don't know it's a shotgun until you're staring down its barrels. I'm not sure I buy the series' general premise, even fictionally - horrifying childhood trauma = soulsucking serial killeritude - but, again, I like that it's consistent. I like that the way Dexter expresses the closest thing he feels to affection is through rigid adherence to Harry's code, in its delicious logic to him. Some of the narration is a little overblown - here, have another moon metaphor! and Dark Passenger - but it fits in a lot of ways. The root of pretentious is pretense, so it makes perfect sense that Dexter is a blooming little font of pretentiosity. His self-awareness of that is what takes him from irritating to backwardly charming. Now I just need to fix my computer's sound card so I can watch season one on demand through netflix.... ...more I simply love Showtime's Dexter.

I loved the constant use of alliteration and the talky sort of stream of consciousness that book-Dexter has going on. The first season of the show follows Darkly Dreaming Dexter very closely, with some exceptions. Most of the characters get fleshed out quite a bit, since the book's supporting characters are pretty 2D. I'm thrilled with how much they expended Batista's role on the show, because he's one of my favorite characters - it was quite a shock to see how little he was in the book. The additions and changes the show makes to the plot are only positive. The book's reveal of the Ice Truck Killer and the use of Dexter's dark dreams to find him toe the believability line. The epilogue of Darkly Dreaming Dexter is sufficiently different enough from the show that I'm pretty hyped up to find out where book 2 takes things. When my library reserve arrives, I think it will likely jump above all the other books in my currently-reading pile. ...more Version: Unabridged Publisher: Recorded Books Narrated by: Author Jeff Lindsay Darkly Dreaming Dexter introduces Dexter Morgan serial killer of serial killers.

He was adopted as a young boy by a polic Version: Unabridged Publisher: Recorded Books Narrated by: Author Jeff Lindsay Darkly Dreaming Dexter introduces Dexter Morgan serial killer of serial killers. To the outside world he is a charming, attractive normal guy with a respectable job with the forensic department. But Dexter (for anyone who hasn\u2019t watched the tv show) is constantly battling his \u201cdark passenger\u201d who dreams of death and can only be assuaged by brutal murder and clinical dismemberment. He was adopted as a young boy by a policeman named Harry who saw Dexter\u2019s darkness early on and was able to instill in him a strict code of rules to control his impulses and keep him safe. Now that Harry is dead, Dexter still hears Harry\u2019s voice in his head and it almost always keeps him on track. Without boring you with an overlong plot rehash I\u2019ll keep it neat and tidy. There\u2019s a serial killer on the loose who is chopping up women and leaving their bloodless body parts for Dexter and company to find. Dexter is intrigued by the killer\u2019s mastery and finesse and makes it his business to track down the guy. But wait! This killer seems to know Dexter\u2019s deepest, darkest secret and begins taunting him. The plot relies heavily on Dexter\u2019s ability to sense the other killer and Dexter\u2019s \u201cdreams\u201d of the murders. Whether you buy it or not will depend entirely on just how far you are willing to suspend your disbelief. I went with it. I\u2019m easy sometimes and I really like Dexter. I borrowed this audiobook from Overdrive and it was narrated by the author. While he does a decent job voicing Dexter\u2019s calm, cool charm and wry sense of humor, he stumbles in a big way with Debra, Dexter\u2019s put-upon stepsister who is desperately trying to get promoted and get off undercover \u201chooker duty\u201d so she can do some actual police work. This Debra unpleasantly barks out every line with ear shattering impatience. As much as I enjoy her character because she is cranky and impatient, I cringed whenever she had something to say here. It wouldn\u2019t have surprised me if she bit Dexter what with the way she was so overly snarly (she didn't). However, it\u2019s not a guy reading a girl thing that I have a problem with here (for once) because Lindsay does LaGuerta\u2019s voice in a smarmy, man-hungry and perfectly fitting way for the power hungry nitwit. Though a story filled with murder and mayhem it surprisingly doesn't dwell on the gory details. Instead it gets into Dexter\u2019s head, explaining how he feels when he gives in to his dark passenger (really freaking good). This is something the show is just unable to do and it helps one understand how his mind works. I enjoyed this story and this intimate look into Dexter\u2019s head and will continue the series. My only nitpick was Dexter\u2019s bad habit of repeating himself. Yeah, yeah so he\u2019s unemotional, not human, follows a strict code and is always in control. I get it. I don\u2019t need to be continually banged over the noggin with those facts. It got tiresome and I felt like the only one he was trying to convince was himself because he was so often NOT in control for most of this book. But other than that complaint, the characters are great and the story zips along at a pace that never loses or bores the crap out of me. ...more I sill enjoyed reading Darkly Dreaming Dexter even though I knew what was gong to happen. Because I have watched most of the first season of Dexter on dvd. The good thing is I haven't watch any of the other seasons of Dexter on dvd. So the rest of the books in the series will be new to me. Will read one a month until I finish the series. Only seven more to go, looking forward to it. I gave Darkly Dreaming Dexter 4 stars. http://palarisme.ro/chef/carti/72-car...

I actually rooted for the not so bad guy! I really wanted to love this book because the TV show is one of my favourite series but it turns out the show is much better. Usually I go on and on about books being unnecessarily long but this book was too short. It just needed more. Jeff Lindsay definitely deserves credit for coming up with the character, Dexter but the book could have been so much better. Michael C. Hall's portrayal of Dexter on the tv show was brilliant and so I was worried that I wouldn't like book Dexter but I was wrong.

Hall's portrayal of Dexter on the tv show was brilliant and so I was worried that I wouldn't like book Dexter but I was wrong. Book Dexter was very entertaining. He was creepy, sarcastic, cynical and dark and I loved him. I thought some of his Dark Passenger passages and dream passages were a bit weird. They just seemed a little ridiculous and I can't ever remember thinking that about those passages in the show. Maybe reading the passages rather than listening to them made them sound silly. The book definitely focused on Dexter a bit too much. I would have loved some more from the other characters. I really hope the other books explore the other characters more. In the TV show the other characters were complex characters but in this book they just felt like different versions of incompetent cop stereotypes. The connection Dexter had to the serial killer was ridiculous. I would have preferred if Dexter used his brilliant mind to track the killer down but instead he just had dreams. While it was kind of cool that his subconscious mind was bringing him back to the past, I just wasn't totally feeling it. I'm not sure I would have liked that at all if I hadn't watched the TV show. The pacing of this book was all wrong. The start was fast and interesting but then it got slow and sort of boring right up until the very end. The book ended way too fast and then the author wrapped it up with a short epilogue but the author didn't really explain how anything played out... How very convenient for you, Mr. Author. So I did like the book but it could have been so much better. The idea was very cool but the execution was definitely lacking. Dexter was a great character but I wanted more from him and the other characters. More than anything, this book made me want to watch the series again but I will be reading the other books in the future. I would recommend this book but not to everyone. The TV show is definitely much better. ...more This is a strange book with a strange premise (a serial killer/cop who kills bad guys as a way to feed his grotesque desires). On that particular front, I had high expectations. After all, getting into the head of a serial killer has so many possibilities. I didn't even mind the humorous undercurrents, though at times the narrative bordered on silly. And, I guess it's hard to make cold-blooded murder funny. But what I couldn't get over was the lack of imagination here.

But what I couldn't get over was the lack of imagination here. Beyond the initial premise, there was nothing. It's as if Lindsay was too lazy to actually explore the depths of the dark hole he dug by introducing this character. Maybe I've just read too many true crime books to feel as if Lindsay does a serial killer or a sociopath justice. In fact, the whole scenario (view spoiler) [I'm a sociopath who kills people for fun because I witnessed unthinkable violence as a child (hide spoiler) ] is so simplistic and so clich\u00e9 as to be annoying to anyone who's even remotely interested in why people do bad things. There were also other aspects of the story so absurd, I literally cringed reading them. I mean, I'm willing to go wherever you take me as long as you keep it interesting and put in the time and effort to make it work...but too many of the story's details seemed to lack any thought or consideration on the author's part. Oh, and the ending is just plain stupid. This series was actually dramatized by Showtime in a very popular TV series by the same name. I watched the first episode last night and while the show shares some of the same shortcomings as the book, I actually felt it was better, though only marginally so. The dark humor seems to work better on screen. I'm tempted to read the next one, if only because this and the TV series were/are so popular. I've got a feeling this one could grow on me. But for now, majorly disappointed. ...more Like Dianne Ladd said in \" Wild at Heart \", this book is a \"peice of S-H-I-toot\". Dexter is a serial killer but only takes out people who deserve it. This is a great book for the housewife reader's circles who want something slightly edgy but lets them sleep at night, too. Dexter's personality is an mix of snobbishness and pseudo-intelligence, neither of which are believable or developed. And the bad news is, the book flap says Dexter will be the main character in more books to come. When I finish Like Dianne Ladd said in \" Wild at Heart \", this book is a \"peice of S-H-I-toot\".

It is creepy in how well the author captured Dexter's personality and reasoning. It was disturbing. My only complaints are with some of the narration. I found it irritating how he would get these feelings he couldn't explain that he was missing something and I would have to sit there until 10 pages later when it came to him, and the cycle would repeat. Not sure if I'll continue with the series. I'm a l I've never watched the TV show so I can't really compare the two, but I found this book creepy.

I'm not sure I even cracked a smile, but it was enjoyable. Just not as good as I'd hoped. This was an entertaining thrill and I thought the Dexter of the book was more humorous than the Dexter of the TV series. Although I confess I liked the TV version better than the book. Apenas llegar a terminar de leer el primer cap\u00edtulo, me hizo pensar que \u00e9ste es un libro de lectura obligatoria para quienes (como yo) aman este g\u00e9nero.

Y es que en esta primera entrega de la saga \"Dexter\" del autor norteamericano Jeff Lindsay, nos sumergimos en una historia peculiarmente encantadora (y digo encantadora en el verdadero y m\u00e1s crudo sentido literal de la palabra) que con su trama que, al ser considerada como thriller por la velocidad del plot, nos va desgajando una historia perturbadora con chispas de humor psic\u00f3pata. Pues s\u00ed, \"humor psic\u00f3pata\". Encantador, \u00bfno? Ja! Bien, la historia se narra en primera persona, en donde nuestro protagonista, Dexter Morgan, es sin lugar la estrella absoluta del libro (aunque sigo considerando que su personalidad, por su fuerza y solidez eclips\u00f3 varias escenas, donde \u00e9l no era el foco, pero por su presencia, termin\u00f3 ocupando el podio). Dexter es un hombre soltero, enigm\u00e1tico y extremadamente atractivo que trabaja para el Departamento de Polic\u00eda de Miami como forense especializado en sangre (Ok, admit\u00e1moslo: son varios puntos a favor). Pero como todo, tambi\u00e9n \u00e9l tiene su lado dif\u00edcil, ya que Dexter tiene una voz interior que le anima a matar, dici\u00e9ndole claramente el cu\u00e1ndo y el c\u00f3mo, esta voz a la que \u00e9l dio el nombre de \"El Pasajero Oscuro\" queda silenciada y satisfecha s\u00f3lo si se cumple de manera correcta lo que dice, manteni\u00e9ndose en silencio hasta que el impulso de matar regresa nuevamente. Pero Dexter, quien trabaja en el Departamento de la Polic\u00eda de Miami, se ve desafiado al encontrarse con un caso que lo deja fascinado por la originalidad de la mano experta del asesino en cuesti\u00f3n, por lo que \u00e9l, m\u00e1s que aprehenderlo, busca aprender t\u00e9cnicas de \u00e9l. La historia da un giro al m\u00e1s puro estilo Cliff-hanger, cuando al final del libro el asesino buscado y admirado por nuestro protagonista estrella resulta ser la persona menos esperada por el lector, dej\u00e1ndonos (me incluyo) con el coraz\u00f3n en la boca. \u00bfRecomendado? -Recomendad\u00edsimo ...more I think it's hard to read a series after having watched it performed so perfectly on television.

Okay, I love the show...it's far and above better than book one. No matter, I still enjoyed this novel. Mr. Lindsay has a smooth flowing style. Its easy, fun and comfortable. This first story is just about on par with season one from Showtime. So, I kinda knew where things where headed. And, things didn't vary that much. (Deb with big boobs and pinup calendar persona is so so so different than Jennifer Carpenters tomboyish look...of course, the trashy foul mouth is the same). I have the remaining novels in this series on my bookshelf so I will read them in order, hoping and praying the remaining are different the other seasons on tv. ...more", "Title": "Darkly Dreaming Dexter"},
