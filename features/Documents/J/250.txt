(i say that, but i've already read the second one and bought the third, and there's only five so far, so i will likely break this vow) in any event, i'm hooked. marko and alana 4eva! ...more Woah.

It\u2019s fast-paced, it\u2019s imaginative, creative, amazingly drawn and there\u2019s one hell of a love story inside it! But it\u2019s not only that. It\u2019s not only a love story or one about war and its consequences. I see something big coming, something important. I can feel it, and you\u2019ll feel it too.

I\u2019m a huge fan of Vaughan\u2019s Y: The Last Man and Ex Machina so no surprise that I loved this. What is surprising is just how bat shit crazy he made this story. Yes, Y:TLM was about the sudden deaths of almost every male on earth, and Ex Machina used the idea of a super hero as the mayor of New York right after 9/11, but both of those started with the real world as the baseline and then explored what happened if you introduced a fantastic element to it. Saga has no similar foundation in a recognizable reality, yet once again Vaughan creates familiar and likeable characters that you can\u2019t help but root for. Alana and <---C>Marko</---C>\u2019s quest to find a safe place to raise their baby is something that anyone can relate to. When they bicker, it reads like real people squabbling. So even though he has horns like a ram and she looks like Rosario Dawson with wings, they could be any young couple trying to protect themselves and their child in desperate circumstances. That the circumstances are like a dream that Neil Gaiman would have while running a high fever and taking too much cold medicine is just the window dressing that make the story so much fun. It\u2019s like a sci-fi fairy tale with a layer of gritty realism to it. It\u2019s also one of the best comics I\u2019ve read recently, and I can\u2019t wait to see how this story plays out. ...more Oh my goodness. I need the next one immediately.

This first volume is a bizarre, imaginative and very funny beginning to what I'm hoping will be a fantastic series. I've read bits here and there of Vaughan's work in the past but this is the first one to make me need to see what else he has in store for us. I honestly have no idea how he comes up with this stuff: soldiers turned star-crossed lovers from opposing armies are on the run from both sides with their newborn child. Not so crazy... until you add a bunch of ghosts, a huge cat that can tell when someone is lying, a royal family of robots... and somehow, amazingly, it all works. The main characters - Alana and Marko - make an hilarious and lovable duo that also offer a realistic portrayal of a relationship between two young lovers with a baby they hadn't planned for. They love each other and their baby daughter. They bicker. They support each other. As different as they may first seem from us regular humans, they are also easy to relate to and I was surprised at how quickly I found myself invested in their story. Alana is tough, loves a good dose of sarcasm and snark, and she isn't afraid to say what she thinks or kick some ass if the occasion calls for it. Gentle, well-meaning pacifist Marko is the complete opposite and they balance each other out so well. It's strange how easily Vaughan managed to juggle several subplots in just 160 pages. The story jumps from scene to scene, introducing new characters at every turn but somehow dealing each one out with enough impact to ensure you don't forget who they are when you're redirected to the next exciting subplot. I, for one, am very excited to see what volume two will bring and I may have to check out some of Vaughan's other series in the meantime or I risk going crazy waiting for more. p.s. Isn't this one of the most disturbing things ever? 'Cause I think so. ...more How to describe Saga ? It's like someone took Firefly , coated it liberally in WTF, and sprinkled a little Quentin Tarantino on top. Yeah, it's some wonderfully messed up stuff. The planet Landfall is at war with one of its moons, known as Wreath.

It's like someone took Firefly , coated it liberally in WTF, and sprinkled a little Quentin Tarantino on top. Yeah, it's some wonderfully messed up stuff. The planet Landfall is at war with one of its moons, known as Wreath. The indigenous people of Landfall seem reliant on technology and sport some nifty little insect-like wings, while the people of Wreath have horns (they may be my favorites as each character in the later issues has horns varying from rhino, to antelope, to ox--you get the idea) and are skilled in the use of magic. The war between these cultures has become an accepted part of life, the hatred of the enemy deeply ingrained in both species. Now enter Marko and Alana, from Wreath and Landfall, respectively, who are ex-soldiers in this war. Defying their cultures, they have fallen in love and the birth of their newborn child, Hazel, has marked them for termination by basically everyone in the universe. Both have known violence and are adept at using it to protect each other and Hazel. On the run from the numerous assassins tracking them, they banter away like a married couple and slowly reveal the history that brought them to this juncture. And now a convenient list of the absurdities that await the Saga reader, so you can gauge whether or not the \"WTF\" element is for you: --a planet known as Sextillion that specializes in, you guessed it, sex --prostitutes that consist of giant heads teetering on top of Rockette style legs --a forest that actually grows rocketships --a race of robots that have television screens for heads --graphic sex scene featuring the aforementioned robots --a topless assassin who is all woman (sans arms) from the waist up and all arachnid from the waist down --the ghost of a teenage girl who must have suffered a gruesome death as she's nothing but hanging intestines from the waist down; naturally, she tags along as Hazel's \"babysitter\" --and LYING CAT, my new favorite comic book character is a giant feline sidekick to The Will, one of the assassins contacted about offing Marko and Alana; Lying Cat can detect whether or not others are engaging in a bit of creative truth telling While the base storyline is one we've read before, the execution is unlike anything I've ever read. Vaughan gleefully injects new and intriguing absurdities into the premise and it's really difficult to get a fix on where this sucker is going--but that's part of the great thing. The ride is so much fun that I really don't care. The artwork by Fiona Staples has a raw and edgy quality that suits the storyline perfectly. I've been getting the monthly issues, which have the added benefit of a letters section in which Vaughan responds to reader letters. The results are often hilarious and I find myself looking forward to this section with the same anticipation I look forward to the storyline.

It is ALL the things. The very first page of the very first chapter sets the tone for the whole series (thus far): You're slapped in the face with the wonder and the ICK of childbirth. Some of you might think the bodily fluids, the wordless, guttural shouts that accompany the pushing, and the million other aspects of child labor are part of the miracle, and you're allowed . . . In an abstract way, I'm not sure I disagree. But from an impartial bystander perspective . . . all of that is the opposite side of the bringing-a-new-life-that-you-helped-create-into-the-world coin. It's gross, man. And if that's a juxtaposition you don't think you can appreciate, then I'm going to go ahead and say goodbye until next time. There is nothing for you here. B/c that's what SAGA is : finding the beauty in the ugliness of life. It's overcoming a lifetime of ingrained prejudice only to discover your victory was merely the first hurdle in the journey. It's growing apart b/c life is life, then coming back together in the face of shared tragedy. It's the determination to remain bitter about past slights opening the door to a new path. It is pain and loss and healing and forgiveness, and it's continuing to put one foot in front of the other, b/c more than anything else, you have to keep moving. It's life. With all the accompanying brilliance and horror, and it is masterfully done. I flew through all six collected volumes in an afternoon, and I seriously doubt I'll have the willpower to wait for the next collection before reading the individually released chapters. That's a first in the graphic novel arena, by the way. But I see serial releases in my future, and I'm not even going to try to fight it. Marko and Alana are two soldiers on opposite sides of a war, who, against all odds, fall in love. SAGA is their story, and it's the story of the ripples their love makes in the pond of their universe. There were times I thought my heart would burst with happiness, and there were times that I felt physically ill. Two sides. One coin. Your turn.

And do you know what else? WOW!!! While it\u2019s truly an original product, if I would describe using comparisons (to make you understand what kind of story is), I\u2019d say that Saga is How I met your Mother meets Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy meets Farscape meets Fullmetal Alchemist .

The war has been for so many time that nowadays they aren\u2019t battling in their own native areas but moving their battlegrounds to other star systems and worlds.

Alana, Marko and now Hazek are stuck in the planet Cleave, and in their daring quest for means to leave the foreign world, they will meet many wonderful, astonishing and lethal characters (merging more than one adjective in different type of combinations resulting in diverse results) in a unpredictable narrative where you never know what will happen next!!! ...more No words.

However, unlike my fear of giant soul sucking spiders, this fear turned out to be foolish and unrealistic. I LOVED THIS SO MUCH! Would you like to do this to someone who pimps out children? Me too! OMG! We have soooo much in common! And don't even get me started on Alana. She's possible the most wonderfully realistic woman ever put down on paper. Ever! I could honestly spend the entire review just gushing about how funny this chick was. When it opens, Alana is giving birth to Hazel. BEST birthing scene EVER! \"Am I shitting? It feels like I'm shitting!\" I was like, OMG! That's me ! I said the same thing! (view spoiler) [My husband won't speak of it, but I'm pretty sure I was right. Also, for those of you who haven't given birth, but are planning to in the future? Don't worry. Even crapping on a table won't stop you man from thinking you're sexy. They tend to forget the horror and gore of childbirth within...oh, I'd say about six weeks. Or whenever your doctor clears you for sex. (hide spoiler) ] And Marko cutting the umbilical cord? Well, I'm using the word cutting loosely. The plot centers around these two and their infant daughter, as they go on the run from the government that wants them dead. Marko, for escaping a work camp/prison. Alana, for deserting the army. It's a love story! Only...with really insane looking alien species. So, the lovebirds are on the run from bounty hunters and an prince with a tv head. I swear! He has a tv for a head! Anyway, there are a couple of these bounty hunters on their trail, including The Will. He's a slice of awesomeness, but his partner steals the show. Lying Cat. I want one! Who agrees with me? We all need a Lying Cat! This story is just fantastic. If you have kids, it might even be more fantastic for you. It's funny, interesting, action packed, and there were a couple of times I turned the page and went GASP! Good stuff, good stuff. If you're like me and tend to skirt around the weird stuff, don't let that stop you this time. It's just about the most honest, least weird, being married with children story I've ever read.

So this ghost named Izabel decides to help the family get to the ship and off the planet if she can go with them so off they go! They go through some more shite but finally end up on their way :-) Let me leave you with this other freaky image from the book. LOL. The hookers down the road on the left if you want to get your uh FREAK on! Fin..... ...more This was seriously so enjoyable. The art was beautiful and the story was so compelling. I don't read a ton of graphic novels but this is the one that has kept me hooked the most BY FAR. The world building was interesting, though not totally explained, but I feel like more of that is coming in later volumes. I can't wait to see where it goes from here! Marko and Alana, soldiers from opposite sides of an interplanetary war, have a child together and go on the run. Hilarity and awesomeness ensue. Yeah, I'm really late to the party on this but Saga is pretty fucking great. It's part space opera, part relationship drama, with lots of laughs and inventive aliens thrown into the mix. Tired of the same old aliens? How about aliens with TVs for heads, aliens with horns, aliens with wings, and humanoid alien spiders?

Tired of the same old aliens? How about aliens with TVs for heads, aliens with horns, aliens with wings, and humanoid alien spiders? There's also magic and spacecraft made out of wood. The characters are quite relateable despite their alien origins. Who doesn't get stressed out taking care of a newborn? Even the foes are three dimensional and somewhat likeable. The Stalk and The Will weren't just asshole bounty hunters and were quite well rounded. If the later volumes are as good as the first, Saga is going to go down as one of my favorite comic series of all time. 4.5 out of five stars. ...more Breast-feeding on the cover of a graphic novel!

The planet of Landfall is at war with the moon of Wreath, and the conflict has managed to engulf the entire galaxy, with combatants from multiple worlds choosing sides to fight on. In a time filled with hatred and violence, two soldiers from opposite sides manage to find love and solace in each other. After the birth of their infant daughter, Private First Class Alana of Landfall and Wreath foot soldier Marko seek to escape the war that has consumed their lives so that their daughter can grow up in peace. Branded as traitors by both sides of the conflict, now the two warring factions have found one thing they can both agree on... Alana and Marko must die!!! Sounds like a really cool concept, right? But as anyone who has read the sublime \"Y The Last Man\" series already knows, for Brian K Vaughan, a great concept is only the beginning! Right from the opening sequence where the birth of an idea is used as a metaphor for childbirth, I knew I was reading something far more sophisticated than simply \"Romeo & Juliet in space\"! Vaughan manages to weave in so many other elements so seamlessly, the end result is a beautifully rich and complex mythology. One of my favorite parts of the story is Izabel, a sweet (although occasionally bratty) ghostly teenage girl who tries to help Alana and Marko in their quest for peace. Izabel's perkiness and humor manages to make her one of the most endearing characters in the book...despite her being only a disembodied torso! Of, course, in order for a concept like this to work, the reader has to truly care about the protagonists. Fortunately, Vaughan executes that perfectly, by giving us two compelling characters who we not only want to learn more about, we NEED to know more about them! In some ways, tough Alana is a perfect foil for pacifist Marko. However, both characters exhibit such strength and benevolence that their quest for happiness is important not only to them, but to the audience as well. Through their personalities, compassion, and wit, Alana and Marko truly touch the hearts of anyone lucky enough to be reading about their exploits! But, as this is vintage Vaughan work, not only the protagonists are compelling...even their pursuers are fascinating! The government of Landfall enlists regal Robot IV to track down the fugitives, and in typical Vaughan fashion, the robot often exhibits more humanity than the people he's working for. Another memorable antagonist is the bounty hunter known only as \"The Stalk\". Enhanced by Fiona Staples' immaculate artwork, The Stalk is one of the creepiest villains I've seen in a long time. But by far my favorite of the pursuers is the freelancer known as \"The Will\". Although he purports to only possess the ethics his clients pay him to have, The Will soon finds himself suffering a personal crisis where his own nobility shines through. Indeed, there are times that I actually found myself rooting FOR the villain, even though I'm well aware The Will's ultimate goal is the destruction of our heroes! Honestly, I could gush on and on for hours about all the parts of the book I loved, but to reveal too much would be a disservice to anyone who hasn't read it yet. Many of the plot twists are better experienced firsthand. So, instead, I'll just leave you with the assurance that I can honestly say I enjoyed every single page of this graphic novel! A vast, sweeping epic tale, \"Saga\" is very aptly named! ...more YO YO YO YO. Buying the rest of the series PRONTO.

Now that that is out of my system, here\u2019s my \u201creview.\u201d \u201cIt was a time of war. Isn\u2019t it always?\u201d Saga takes us to the future where the current war is between the \u201chorns\u201d and the \u201cwings.\u201d The story starts with a bang straight from the jump where we find our leading lady Alana experiencing the . . . uhhhhhh \u201cmiracle of life\u201d . . . It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out the parents are of the star-crossed lover variety since she\u2019s sporting some wings and he\u2019s rocking horns. New daddy Marko barely has time to gnaw through the umbilical cord before Coalition Forces are banging down the door demanding the duo either surrender or die. Lucky for them, one of Shelby\u2019s buddies comes along to save the day . . . and offers them a map to the \u201cRocketship Forest\u201d . . . (Alright, alright, so it\u2019s not a map that looks someone pooping, but when am I ever gonna get a chance to use that image again? Amiright or amiright?) Alana and Marko better hurry, though, \u2018cause there are some serious bad mamma jammas on their tail. During the trek to the hopefully-not-completely-made-up Rocketship Forest, we discover that Alana is totally kickass and Marko is sometimes a bit pathetic \u2013 much like one of my other favorite couples . . . and that they eventually might come across something called the \u201cHORRORS\u201d . . . Terrifying right? Alana learns a bit more about Marko\u2019s past and they finally decide on the baby\u2019s name . . . (Ha! Just kidding) We also get to experience a lil sumthin sumthin on the planet Sextillion . . . And just when Alana and Marko think they might be in the clear, the most terrifying foe a young couple ever has to battle arrives making for the BEST. ENDING.

I'm usually not a big fan of sci-fi at all but I kept hearing great things about this series so I decided to pick it up and I don't regret it one bit. Forgive me if I don't take relationship advice from a dead teenager missing her vagina. It has some of the most hilarious lines ever. I laughed out loud several times while reading it which doesn't happen very often for me. The plot: The story at its core isn't that bizarre when you think about it. Two star crossed lovers from opposing armies are on the run from both sides with their new born child. But when you add a huge lying cat, a bunch of kid ghosts and people with TV heads ... that's when it gets crazy. The characters: I liked all of them! I'm not even sure if I'm rooting for the the couple or for the thug who's been hired to kill them. Overall, this was a true masterpiece of both art and literature. It cracked me up and it kept me on the edge of my seat. What more could you ask for in a book? Thanks for reading. Share your thoughts. ...more GIVE ME MARKO AND NOBODY WILL GET HURT!!!!

The bizarrity! This really has it all, and then some, when it comes to weird shit going on.

YES, ghost children. 3.) The Romeo & Juliet arc! I love me some star-crossed lovers, guys. Alana and Marko are as different as night and day (and PLEASE give me Marko, gah) and it was so sweet and fun to watch those battling backgrounds play against each other throughout this volume. Yet they are together, and it is sweet, funny and real feeling. 4.) The art! Self explanatory! Just look for yourself: 5.) The badass parents!

But the choice is presented with this goofy vibe that keeps it lighthearted and silly and fun, like everything in the world of Saga.
