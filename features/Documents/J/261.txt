I did not expect anything when I bought this book. All I knew was that it was a collection of five novellas that transpired before the events of Throne of Glass , and I'm reading it to make the wait for Heir of Fire more bearable. I especially did not expect to resemble a certain sponge after reading: The fact that Sarah J. Maas was able to break my heart with five novellas scares me, a lot . Throne of Glass is a six-book series and as of now (<---B>June 2014</---B>) there are only 2 books published, she has 4 more books which is a lot of time in the author world coming out and with the potential she's shown so far, I think I need to start packing up on tissues.<---F> Speaking of which, Ms</---F>. Maas, I have a gift for you: If you want to prepare for this book then read the Survival Guide to Assassin's Blade ! Between these novellas and Throne of Glass, I'd say these give Celaena more justice. My favourite between the five would be Assasin and the Empire because of Sam Cortland and of course,<---M> the plot</---M>, the writing etc., but mostly Sam Cortland . Oh Sam *dreamy eyes* He blew my mind away and stole my heart in the process. Sam, I am rooting for you even if *cough* you know *cough* I'm still rooting for you ! TO CELAENA AND SAM: THAT ENDING: WHY? WHY?! Why Sarah J. Maas? Sarah J. Maas, that was cruel. Absolutely cruel . ...more This review will be a little different from my others for several reasons. This is a series we are way too deep into for me to go over each character or plot.

This is a series we are way too deep into for me to go over each character or plot. I won\u2019t me writing a super detailed review for each one, just a small summary, my favorite quote, and the rating. <+++>The Assassin's Blade</+++> is a bind up of five novellas for the Throne of Glass Series . I\u2019m just going to say this right way... I wish I would have read this right after Throne of Glass . I wish I wouldn't have waited till I was four books in to pick this up. This book would have changed the way I viewed this series, and I mean that in the best way. These stories\u00a0changed the way I see Celaena ,answered both little and big questions I had, and ultimately decided whose \"team\" I'm on... but I'll get to that part in a few. These stories cover everything from young Celaena up until the point she ends up\u00a0at Endovier (a salt mine prison). The Assassin and the Pirate Lord - 10/10 Celaena is sent with Sam to meet up with a Pirate Lord ( obviously ) to set up a deal for her boss. This is the first time we really get too see her and Sam actually interact. If you\u2019ve read any of the other books, even just the first, then you know how sassy Celaena is and we get a look into why she is this way. Especially towards Sam. We get to see how she got her start, and how their relationship actually started. I know we\u2019ve heard bits a pieces in the other books, but these start filling in all the cracks. After a twist in the plan is presented the two they have to deceive what path they want to take, and pick whose side they are going to be on. Favorite Quote: \u201cYou want my advice?\u201d he asked her. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d watch my back around Sam. You might be the best, Sardothien, but there\u2019s always someone waiting for you to slip.\u201d Sam, the traitorous bastard, didn\u2019t hide his smirk. The other pirate captains chuckled. Celaena stared hard at Rolfe\u2026 \u201cYou want my advice?\u201d He waved a hand, beckoning her to go on. \u201cMind your own business.\u201d The Assassin and the Healer - 9/10 After returning home from her mission with the Pirate Lord she is sent to the Red Deseret. This is where she will spend her summer as punishment. Before arriving to the Red Desert she is stuck in a small town waiting for her boat to arrive the next day. She finds herself helping a barmaid and teaching her how to defend herself. This was my least favorite story in the book. I also believe it is the shortest one. I didn\u2019t hate it; it just didn\u2019t have the same effect on me the other ones did. I didn\u2019t feel like it gave me as much. I did like that it had a lot of the bitter angry Celaena that I love so much. Favorite Quote: \u201cLet me give you a bit of advice, from one working girl to another: Life isn\u2019t easy, no matter where you are. You\u2019ll make choices you think are right, and then suffer for them.\u201d The Assassin and the Desert - 10/10 Celaena finally arrives at the Red Desert to spend the summer training with the Mute Master as punishment. While she is there she has to go through a Kill Bill style training to redeem a letter from the master before she can return back to the Guild. While there we learn how she got to be as good as she is, how she is starting to feel for Sam, and we get to hear about the \u201cfirst real\u201d friend she\u2019s ever made. This is the story that I feel lays down the foundation for why Celaena became the softer version of herself that we have all grown to love so much. Think this is where she goes from villain to something more. Some might disagree or think it happened at some other point, and some might think it hasn\u2019t happened at all. Favorite Quote: \u201cGo to Hell\u201d Ansel chuckled \u201cI\u2019ve been to Hell.\u201d The Assassin and the Underworld- 10/10 Celaena is back from the desert and ready distract herself from owning up to her feeling. Not just the feelings she has for Sam but towards everything. She decides throwing herself fully into a mission is the best way to do this. The Underworld was the biggest surprise read to me. Out of all five this one was my favorite. Everything finally clicks, things really starts happening, and everything we\u2019ve been waiting for is slammed into us. This story will always have a special place in my heart, and in this series. The best part is we get so much Sam and Celaena time. I thought that the last story was going to be the one that choked me up, but this is the novella that got me. I was sneak reading at work and had to cry on the inside like a winner. So many feels. Favorite Quote: \u201cand from today onward, I want to never be separated from you. Where you go, I go. Even if that means going to Hell itself, where you are, that\u2019s where I want to be. Forever.\u201d The Assassin and the Empire - 10/10 If you\u2019ve read even just the first few chapters of Throne of Glass, then you already know what is going to happen in this story\u2026 I would like to say that you\u2019ll be ready for it\u2026 but I won\u2019t lie. You won\u2019t be. This story has everything in it. The emotions, the fighting, the betrayal, the answers about what really happened to Sam that terrible evening, and how Celaena ultimately got caught. This story will break you. Second favorite in this bind up. Favorite Quotes: \u201cDeep down, she said, \u201cI\u2019m a coward.\u201d His brows rose. \u201cI\u2019m a coward,\u201d she repeats \u201cAnd I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared all the time. Always.\u201d \u201cI am <---C>Celaena Sardothien</---C>\u2026 and I will not be afraid.\u201d This book had me laughing, crying, swearing, praying, and completed me. I thought it would help with the pain of waiting for book five, but all it did was make me crave it even more. I love Celaena, she is my favorite literary female. She falls in this area of being a villain and being a hero. She is everything I want from my leading lady. She is fire and smoke. She is hard and soft. Loving, strong, and weak. She is changing the game... I thank Sarah J every day for this series. I finally want to end this long review with these two statements: (this isn\u2019t a spoiler it\u2019s just my theory) I in no way shape or form believe Sam is dead. I might be in denial but I just don\u2019t. I think the biggest twist in this series will be that he is still alive. Also for the question I left hanging at the beginning of this; whose team am I on\u2026 Thought it was Rowan, but then again something always felt like it was missing. That\u2019s because Sam is what was missing. I am officially and 100% on Team Sam. If he really really isn\u2019t around, then I want Celaena to stand on her own. This series is phenomenal.

Some stories I liked more than others, but it was nice to see what happened to Celaena leading up to Throne of Glass. I would have liked to have seen more of her when she was younger and training, though.

Reviewed by: Rabid Reads 4.5 stars ***Please be aware that while refraining from spoiling the specific novella I'm reviewing at the time, there may be spoilers from any prior novellas.*** I view these stories as five separate but related tales--like a series--b/c that's how I originally read them. I'll include links at the bottom of the post to the individual reviews on Goodreads, for those of you who are afraid of being inadvertently spoiled. In the summer of '12, I was desperately seeking new reading material, and stumbled across the preview chapters of THRONE OF GLASS by Sarah J. Maas. I downloaded them, devoured them, and gashed my teeth in impatience when I discovered the full book wasn't due to be released for several more weeks. BUT. There were four prequel novellas that were available. So I one-clicked all of them and read them immediately. They only increased my hunger for THRONE OF GLASS. ~The Assassin and the Pirate Lord~ First, I think it's important to recognize that one of--if not the --main purposes of these novellas is to grow Celaena from an intolerably insolent and arrogant adolescent into a world-wiser (but still cocky) young adult. The #1 complaint about this series is that readers don't like Celaena. Personally, I love her, but I understand why others might not. She's a superlative character who some people can't handle her extremes, and that's only one of a dozen legitimate issues. BUT. There are several loudly voiced complaints that, as far as I'm concerned, don't hold water. I've already addressed my feelings in regards to the claim that she is too girly to make a believable assassin in my Throne of Glass review. The other assertion I cannot abide is that Celaena \"never does anything,\" or \"never kills anyone.\" That she's basically all talk. Maybe I'm confused, but I've never supposed that assassins are meant to go around killing EVERYONE indiscriminately. And she's not just an assassin. She's the King of Assassins' heir. Adarlan's Assassin . At least half of her identity is reputation, and it wouldn't behoove that reputation (or be good for business) to run around like a maniac slitting throats and eviserating passersby. In this novella, she's a sixteen-year-old girl who single-handedly disarms and disables the entire crew of a pirate ship. She easily defeats the Pirate Lord in combat, using his own weapons to do it. How is that nothing? How is that all talk? *mind is boggled* Beyond establishing herself as a seriously kick-ass heroine, the foundation for something that will shred your heart into teeny, tiny pieces is also laid. <------*WAILS* And, you know . . . there are pirates. Everything is better with pirates. SO. Not my favorite of the bunch, but a close(ish) second. ~The Assassin and the Healer~ This novella wasn't part of the original four. I chased down pieces of it on various blogs, over the course of several days before CROWN OF MIDNIGHT was released. Anyway, I liked this one a lot, too. So should anyone who thinks Celaena doesn't kill often enough. How about six or eight mercs in a dark alley after they try to rob and attack a barmaid? All I'm saying is that's an awful lot of bodies piling up for an assassin who allegedly doesn't assassin. Moving on. We also learn some Celaena background: that her country was destroyed by war, and she feels a kinship with others who have suffered similar fates. That as a child she had dreams that are in complete contradiction to her current status. Aaaannddd we (once again) get to observe the softer side of Celaena. The side that compels her to intervene on behalf of others when she can--one of the many reasons I'm able to overlook her more abrasive qualities. Bottom line: a worthy addition to the canon. ~The Assassin and the Desert~ Oh, my FEELS. They hurrrrrrt *sobs* So what does is say about me that this is my favorite of the group? Hmm . . . In the inevitable aftermath of her actions in Pirateville, Celaena is sent into the blistering, unforgiving heat of the desert to train with the Mute Master, Arobynn's (infinitely more benevolent) Southern counterpart. She has one month to train with the Silent Assasssins. One month to earn the Mute Master's respect in the form of a letter to Hamel on Celaena's behalf, commending her efforts and abilities. One. Month. This is the novella that makes me determinedly profess that readers' NEED to read the prequels. There are people and places and events that have already begun to play a greater role in the main books, with half a dozen foreshadowings of things to come. You. NEED. To. Read. It. And it won't make sense, if you haven't read the first one, and after that . . . Well, why not just read them all? Besides . . . Don't you want to see Celaena fumble her way through her first friendship? And not just her first friendship, but her first friendship with a GIRL? Of course you do. And who could blame you? ~The Assassin and the Underworld~ This novella should have been called THE ASSASSIN AND THE TANGLED WEB OF AROBYNN HAMEL, but I guess it doesn't rollllll off the tongue the same way. I really wish I could give you an accounting of the events that take place here unhindered by the knowledge of what's to come. But I can't. I read it too many times and it broke my heart too completely. THE ASSASSIN AND THE UNDERWORLD is about what happens when Celaena returns to the Assassin's Keep after Arobynn beat her into unconsciousness and sent her to the desert. Celaena arrives full of confidence and more than a little bit of self-satisfaction. She succeeded in accomplishing her nearly-impossible-to-complete task. More than succeeded. Was sent home from the Red Desert with a fortune great enough to purchase her freedom. When she struts into Arobynn's office, she has every intention of telling him, and leaving him. Unfortunately . . . It doesn't work out that way. Instead, she allows herself to fall back under his spell. Not fully, she's been made too wary for that, but enough that she becomes an unwilling accomplice in his nefarious plans one last time. This is where we first see the depth of Arobynn's treachery. My thoughts on Celaena's lack of immediate response to said treachery upon her return to Rifthold in ToG: (view spoiler) [Many think Celaena is being willfully obtuse about the role her mentor played in the events that led to Sam's horrific death and her imprisonment at Endovier, but this is something I understand: \"Father, brother, lover\u2014he\u2019d never really declared himself any of them. Certainly not the lover part, though if Celaena had been another sort of girl, and if Arobynn had raised her differently, perhaps it might have come to that. He loved her like family, yet he put her in the most dangerous positions. He nurtured and educated her, yet he\u2019d obliterated her innocence the first time he\u2019d made her end a life. He\u2019d given her everything, but he\u2019d also taken everything away. She could no sooner sort out her feelings toward the King of the Assassins than she could count the stars in the sky.\" And there's nothing she can DO about it in the course of the first few books. She knows they'll see each other again, but as much as she desires vengeance and is determined to get it: \"In the silence of her bedroom, she swore an oath to the moonlight that if Sam were hurt, no force in the world would hold her back from slaughtering everyone responsible.\" She also dreads it. Celaena is a work in progress. She's headstrong and stubborn. Arrogant with poor impulse control. BUT. She is growing. Steadily. Consistently. Eventually she'll reach the point where she can take an unobscured look at Arobynn and acknowledge not only how he betrayed her to the king, but how he was none of things to her she'd struggled with reconciling: father, brother, lover. He was a plague . (hide spoiler) ] ~The Assassin and the Realm~ THE ASSASSIN AND THE REALM starts at the end. Celaena is suddenly a prisoner of we-don't-know-whom/we-don't-know-why. All we know is that she's shattered. She does not care that she's caged like an animal. She does not care that she's in chains. Cold, hunger, thirst, all things beyond her concern. And then . . . in the dark . . . she remembers. Maas is an expert at cultivating DREAD. It may not be as stealthy here, what with us already knowing that Celaena---in some context---has failed, but that doesn't negate the fear, the roil in your belly, as you push yourself to keep reading, to find out what happened, what went wrong, so that at least then . . . it will be over. As I said earlier, I read these before reading THRONE OF GLASS, so I can't state from experience that if you're having issues with Celaena, reading THE ASSASSIN'S BLADE will fix them. BUT. I can say that I've never had any issues with her character development, and the majority of readers who have taken my advice have found themselves understanding her better than they had previously. Beyond that, you need the background from Celaena's time in the Red Desert to fully appreciate what's happening in the main series (my favorite YA series, incidentally). <------FYI. SO. Read it. I'm so far passed \"recommending\" it that I'm brandishing it wildly. \u201cMy name is Celaena Sardothien,\u201d she whispered, \u201c and I will not be afraid.\u201d My other reviews for this series: Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1) Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass #2) Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3) Queen of Shadows (Throne of Glass #4) Untitled (Throne of Glass, #5) [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more I actually enjoyed this more than the first book!

GENRE; High Fantasy/YA/Romance (with adventure) The Assassin's Blade is a combine of all the novellas from the Throne of Glass series, which include The Assassin and the Pirate Lord , The Assassin and the Healer , The Assassin and the Desert , The Assassin and the Underworld , and The Assassin and the Empire MEET THE COLDHEARTED, SARCASTIC AND BITCHY ASSASSIN. (P.S - i have no f****** idea why Celaena has WHITE hair on the covers and why everyone thinks that is true. CELANEA HAS BLONDE HAIR, ok? Get it right, darlings). The book follows Celeana Sardothien, who is obviously our protagonist. She has become Adarlan's greatest assassin at just the age of 16. Consequently, she has a huge debt to pay to Arobynn Hamel - the king of Assassins - for her reputation, taking her in and teaching her the skills she needed to survive. But his enemies stretch far and wide across the continent, and its part of Celaena's job to hunt them down. For one of those assignements she is partened up with her rival, Sam. These journeys will be the key to a chain of events that will seal her fate, cut her heart in two forever, and teach her that even the smallest of things come with a price. First of all, i was astonished that The Assassin's Blade was actually a bit better from the 1st book in the series Throne of Glass . Say what?! That's sayong something because i utterly loved the 2 books currently out. And i agree with other readers that this should have been the first book. But what can you do about it now? There is just so much more adventure, angst and action ! Compared to this one, it seems now like the other books are slightly dull. What i thought of Celaena?; \u201cWhen we die,\" she said, \"I don't think the gods will even know what to do with us.\" Frankly, dear Celaena, i don't know what to do with you either. Another surprise or discovery whilsts i was reading this book was that i actually started to dislike Celaena , and see a side of her that i was blind to previously. She was almost constantly whining about something (i am too lazy to search for examples from the book, but trust me, there was a lot of them). If you think Celaena was kickass then, wait till you read the novellas, baby! That's the real badass assassin! It feels like she was holding back on us in Throne of Glass, and Crown of Midnight, but she sure as heck don't hold back in this book - from destroying buildings and cities, to overthrowing and freeing people. I feel like she was a bigger vain, bitch than she was before, but i can't really tell for sure as i read the other books last year. When she was mean to Sam, i was like... What i thought of Sam?: Everybody is fighting between team Chaol and team Dorian. I must admit i was team Chaol, but now i'm like BITCHES, PLEASE! THIS LASS IS TEAM SAM! Previously, we know of him from Celaena's thoughts and memories, but here we finally get to meet him! He is one of my top fave characters of all time as of now. Sam is an assassin too, 2nd best, but he is the biggest sweatheart and nicest person ever. I fell in love with him from chapter one, rooted and supported him to the very end. The writing style and story-telling is as usual EXCELLENT . Overall , The Assassin's Blade - a heartbreaking, action-packed YA fantasy that will take you on a wild adventure and turning the pages. Had me swooning, laughing and tearing up the next minute. An unforgettable tale of trust, friendship, betrayal, love and most of all kickarsery! 5 stars.

I have heard mixed reviews about The Throne of Glass series, ranging from people loving it to hating it which has resulted in me constantly pushing it back on my TBR. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised. I personally really enjoy Sarah J. Mass' writing. It is well done and engaging. Unfortunately, I did see a spoiler which meant that the ending of the last prequel wasn't a shock. Now, a lot of people will say that \"oh well, it's in the first book\" and I can understand that, but I haven't read the first book. So, it did matter to me. This bind-up features five novellas about Celaena and the events which lead to her being in the salt mines in Throne of Glass . I'm going to go more into detail about the novella's now since I don't think it's quite fair to just clump them all together. The Assassin and The Pirate Lord Rating: 4 Stars. \u201cHer beauty was a weapon\u2014one she kept honed\u2014but it could also be a vulnerability.\u201d The Assassin and The Pirate Lord was a great novella to start the bind-up. It is what leads to all the events that follow. It is ultimately the catalyst. We follow Sam and Celaena as they make plans behind their Master, The Assassin King's, back. The plans that are made are what result in everything to follow and shows the true colours of The Assassin King (who's name I can't remember how to spell). I thoroughly enjoyed this novella, it was full of badassery. The fight scenes were well described and painted a picture on what was happening while also setting up two of the main characters in the bind-up - Sam and Celaena. The Assassin and The Healer Rating: 3 Stars. \u201cThere was such irony, she realised, in them working together\u2014the assassin and the healer. Two opposite sides of the coin.\u201d The Assassin and The Healer was the smallest novella in the bind-up. It was also probably the least interesting despite the insight into the fact that Celaena isn't the bad person she is made out to be. The story is told from the perspective of a healer Yrene and Celaena. I enjoyed Yrene's descriptions of Celaena, they painted the picture of her even more. For example, the following quote: \u201cThis girl wasn\u2019t like wildfire\u2014she was wildfire. Deadly and uncontrollable. And slightly out of her wits.\" However, despite enjoying the characters, the bind-up was the most forgettable. It was a filler novella, overall, not adding much to the story and not being mentioned later. The Assassin and The Desert Rating: 3.5 Stars. \u201cOf course she was worthy. She was Celaena Sardothien, gods be damned.\u201d In The Assassin and The Desert we follow Celaena through the desert to reach the Silent Assassins, somewhere she is going on an order from the King of Assassin's after he beat her unconscious for going against his orders. This novella, in particular, was interesting despite my lower rating - purely because I stopped a lot while reading it. I enjoyed watching the friendship form between Celaena and Ansel, Celaena learning that she can trust people. However, the trust is followed by the betrayal of (view spoiler) [Ansel (hide spoiler) ] . I enjoyed the Mute Assassin and the whole kindness that he showed, (view spoiler) [like when he gives her the money to pay off her debt to the King of Assassin's. (hide spoiler) ] I also loved the fact that to realise she had feelings for Sam, Celaena had to be taken out of the immediate situation. That is what made the next novella so good for me. The Assassin and The Underworld Rating: 4 Stars. \u201cYou want to know what price I asked for forgiving Arobynn, Celaena?\u201d She slowly turned. With the ongoing rain, the hall was full of shadows and light. Sam stood so still that he might have been a statue. \u201cMy price was his oath that he\u2019d never lay a hand on you again. I told him I\u2019d forgive him in exchange for that.\u201d The Assassin and The Underworld followed the growing relationship between Celaena and Sam. I enjoyed it thoroughly as the pair continued to bicker and argue, despite the obviousness of their feelings. I found the story in this particular a bit harder to follow, the names ultimately confused me and I again had to keep putting it down to do other things. I'm not sure what else to say about this particular novella, apart from the fact it included freedom and yet another betrayal from someone trusted. Though, this betrayal I was expected. The Assassin and The Empire Rating: 4 Stars. \u201cThe only secret I\u2019ve borne my entire life is that I love you.\u201d He gave her a slight smile. \u201cIt was the one thing I believed I\u2019d go to the grave without voicing.\u201d His eyes were so full of light that it almost stopped her heart.\u201d The Assassin and The Empire was a bittersweet novella. Like I mentioned in the beginning of this review (view spoiler) [I knew Sam died (hide spoiler) ] and the whole time I was just waiting for it to happen. It happened faster than I thought it would as well. The final novella is the story of how Sam and Celaena are trying to make a life for themselves now that they are free. They want to get away from the control of The Assassin's Guild (?) they are a part of, to start anew. Well, Sam does. Celaena is more reluctant to do so, and due to that reaction - ends with everything going south. I did enjoy this novella despite knowing where the ending was going to lead me. I expected the betrayal, yet again. It was hard not to see it coming, (view spoiler) [especially when The Assassin King kept popping up. (hide spoiler) ] Overall , I'm glad I read this bind up before the first book. I read a review of someone about Throne of Glass and it was talking about how spoilt Celaena was. Now, that makes sense to me seeing as where she came from and luxury she was used to . I am excited to start the first book in The Throne of Glass series. It should be interesting at the very least. ...more No, I'm not ok. Rather than tell you how I feel, let me show you how I feel. Spoilers. Sam. I cannot. I just cannot. Was this a necessary read for the series? Yes. Does it make it any easier? No. For those of you have a REALLY hard time with death in a book.. let me prepare you. The ONLY way I was able to cope with this book was: 1. Chocolate 2. Tissues 3. Bookmarked moments from book 3 and 4 of TOG in order to go back and read happy moments of sweet, sweet justice. That is all.

I was expecting a lot worse, honestly. I initially checked it out to see Sam since you hear so much about him in later books, but there really wasn't as much about him as I thought there would be. Or maybe I just braced for the worst. It's more about Celaena's twisted relationship with Arobynn than anything else. And THAT was enough to permanently mess anyone u \"My name is Celaena Sardothien and I will not be afraid.\" Well, that quote just got a whole lot more meaning to it. I SURVIVED THIS BOOK!

Her reactions and dependency on him were so sad, but really show how strong she becomes later. This book brought SO much insight to Celaena's character overall and I loved all of the stories (despite the sad). The second and third novellas were a bit slower, but I'm really hoping we see more of those random characters in Empire of Storms! This was my second time reading it and I'm not sure I got too much more out of it this time, but I do totally recommend reading it at least once! Maybe even before Throne of Glass or Crown of Midnight if you're just starting the series because it really does add a TON of depth to everything. ...more \u201cShe was fire, she was darkness, she was dust and blood and shadow.\u201d ( X ) I'm not a big fan of the Throne of Glass series, to be honest. The world-building, the narrative and the stories are undeniably terrific except the characters. I couldn't even connect to Celaena Sardothien since the first book, which I read two years ago. Choal and Dorian still couldn't move me, though I was into Chaol while I was reading Crown of Midnight.

You'll make choices you think are right, and then suffer for them.\u201d Finally I figured out the only problem I'd had with this series. It is Celaena Sardothien herself that always pulls me back whenever I want to enjoy the books, her character is indeed bad-ass, yet she's inaccessible and quite annoying for me. So this is why the ToG series had been three stars reading until Empire of Storm (You can find my five-star review here ) Suffice to say, my feeling towards this book is still like what I have for the first four books of this series. Celaena's POV bored me, and her character being pampered and holding a grudge against everyone around her made it worse. Still I liked the spectacular viewing of this world, which undoubtedly pushed me to the last page of this collection of the novellas.

I loved Sam, (view spoiler) [but his death is incredibly fast and unprepared (hide spoiler) ] , and I was not ready even though I'd already known. However, The Assassin's Blade is a perfect prelude for who wants to learn more about the Throne of Glass world and what happened to Calaena before she becomes a champion in book one. \u201cRain continued beating against the hall windows, a distant reminder that there was still a world around them.\u201d I sure liked the ending. It's a forshadowing of what's coming. https://goo.gl/vt7q2h [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more I absolutely loved these prequels to the 'Throne of Glass' series. Taking place during Celaena's years as an elite assassin working for her master, Arobynn, this grouping of prequels sheds a lot of light on the events that molded Celaena into the woman we met in 'Throne of Glass'. It is no wonder that she avoids relationships and entanglements. Her story was heartbreaking!

It is no wonder that she avoids relationships and entanglements. Her story was heartbreaking! Celaena spends her time trying to run from a past that haunts her, while simultaneously trying to gain the love and approval she lost when her parents were brutally murdered. Yet, despite her desperate need to feel loved, she is uncompromising in her values and sense of morality. This is probably my favorite thing about Celaena. She stands up for what she believes is right. Perhaps it is fitting, then, that it is her steely resolve that brings about her downfall. When she goes against her master, refusing to participate in his slave trade dealings, she sets off a chain of events that will bring her to her knees. Her brave actions may have solidified her unlikely alliance with Sam, a fellow assassin, but those same actions sealed her fate. By the time this chapter of her story unfolds, she will have lost the man she loved and her freedom. While I knew how this chapter of her story would end up, it was worth experiencing. Background information was shared that she'd new light on some of the events in the 'Throne of Glass' books. I read the first two books in the series before going back and reading these prequels. I'm glad that I did before I started the third book. I think this information will continue to be helpful to understand this complex, rapidly evolving series. I loved every minute of 'The Assassin's Blade'. I highly recommend this set of prequels if you're a fan of the 'Throne of Glass' series. I can't get enough of this badass female assassin! ...more \u275dShe was fire, she was darkness, she was dust and blood and shadow.\u275e Of all five novellas I only liked two of them. Overall, I was just kinda bored with the stories. I think I might've just set my expectations a little too high considering how it's Sarah J. Maas and the Throne of Glass series. But to be honest, I'm a bit disappointed. This book is finally when we meet the late Sam Cortland. SJM constantly brings up Sam in every book in the series, but until now I never knew who Sam really was. \u275dShe was fire, she was darkness, she was dust and blood and shadow.\u275e Of all five novellas I only liked two of them.

SJM constantly brings up Sam in every book in the series, but until now I never knew who Sam really was. I did figure that this character must be one hell of a guy if SJM never rests mentioning a deceased character that we don't even officially meet in the series. At least in that aspect, The Assassin's Blade didn't disappoint. Sam Cortland was a great character. It was heartbreaking to know what his fate would be in the end, and you're left feeling a bit helpless knowing you can't change how Sam's story plays out. :( I've never really been a fan of Celaena. She does have her noble moments and moments where you just feel for her but there's just something that I don't find appealing about her no matter how many times she does something great. However, I do feel as if I prefer Celaena over Aelin? I'm not really sure. They're not that different from one another but I do feel as if Celaena is more... likable. In the Throne of Glass series, SJM just sort of sets Sam and Celaena's relationship on a pedestal. Although I do like them together, I'm probably going to get hate for saying this, but their relationship wasn't as great as SJM and everyone else was making it seem? Maybe it was just the hype. Maybe it's me being heartless but if I didn't actually like them so much, I would probably even say that their relationship happened pretty fast. I know that these are just novellas so things have to happen more fast paced but ehhh. I liked the idea of them as a couple but I feel like we weren't given the time to fully develop a LOVE for them. And in truth, I really hate when authors pull the \"I've loved you since the very beginning\" card or the \"I acted like I hated you but I actually loved you\". I feel like that's a cop out on trying to buy you time on how long a relationship has been developing because even if you mention that there's been feelings from the very beginning before the book takes place, it doesn't actually count as development, at least not for me, because I don't actually see that happening. Of course my heart still broke for Celaena and Sam but not as much as I thought it would. As for the novellas as a whole, most of them were pretty slow in the beginning and pick up towards the end. I didn't really pick up anything new from these novellas. I already knew Arobynn was garbage so it was unfortunate to have to put up with Satan again for the time being. I think I probably would've had a better reading experience with The Assassin's Blade if I actually read it when I was supposed to which was... before Heir of Fire if I'm not mistaken? Well, either way I definitely should've read it before Queen of Shadows lol. The vibes of this book are VERY different from the later books in ToG. It's almost like they're two completely different series so reading TAB when I did felt disjointed to the rest of the series. I only decided to pick up this book because I was told that characters in TAB would show up later on in Empire of Storms. So hopefully reading these novellas will actually make my reading experience with EoS better now that I'll be familiar with some of the names that will come up later on! 1.

I do like how in both of the stories we've seen a little bit of the compassionate side to Celaena. I want to see her do some more badass stuff though! And where's Sam?! The Assassin and the Desert- 5/5 stars This story was interesting, definitely my favorite so far. It could've been a book by itself. I loved all the references to things we know from the books, and honestly, I'm hoping some of these characters will appear in the books :) The Assassin and the Underworld- 4/5 stars A little bit boring, but the ending made up for it. Celaena needs revenge ASAP but we all know how the next story is going to end :( The Assassin and the Empire- 4/5 stars We all knew that this was coming :( Also, I love how all these stories and characters become relevant in Empire of Storms. One of my biggest problems with short stories is that they just feel kind of pointless... I can't feel that drawn to the story in such few pages even if I already know the characters, so I'm glad SJM incorporated these stories into the main storyline! ...more Although the writing was beautiful (as is expected by the magical Sarah J. Maas), it took me more than two months to get through. Because it was a bind-up of novellas, every novella had to have a fulfilling ending which made the pace of the entire book feel slow and awkward and I couldn't fly through it the way I flew through the first two books. That is the only problem I had with the book, though, and although I knew how the story would end, it left me in tears! I love this series so much it kills me. Celaena+Sam=ugly crying The Assassin and the Pirate Lord. 4 stars! Sam smiled, his brown eyes turning golden in the dawn. It was such a Sam look, the twinkle of mischief, the hint of exasperation, the kindness that would always, always make him a better person than she was. I never usually read novellas, mostly because I'm perfectly happy with the information a book provides. I don't usually feel the need to read more, but the Throne of Glass series is different. More than once, Celaena mentioned missions she underwen The Assassin and the Pirate Lord. 4 stars! Sam smiled, his brown eyes turning golden in the dawn.

I never usually read novellas, mostly because I'm perfectly happy with the information a book provides. I don't usually feel the need to read more, but the Throne of Glass series is different. More than once, Celaena mentioned missions she underwent with her partner in crime (more often than not) Sam and although we already know what his fate is, I really wanted to know what Sam was like in the time Celaena received the title \"Adarlan's Assassin.\" The Assassin and the Pirate Lord did not disappoint! We get an insight in Celaena's legendary missions alongside Sam, and their love/hate relationship is beautiful. In such a short span of time (less than 100 pages) Maas managed to make me fall in love with Sam's snark and witty comebacks, and the pleasure he takes in annoying the shit out of Celaena. And I already know I'm going to be HEARTBROKEN. Now onto The Assassin and the Healer ! The Assassin and the Healer. 3 stars! The girl wore her scars the way some women wore their finest jewelry. YES, CELAENA, YES. That girl is so awesome. As she waits at the White Pig Inn for a ship to take her across the ocean, Celaena is spoiling for a fight. Yet, there are no takers: men and women stare at her weapons, her elaborate brooch, the shining coins she places on the table, but no one starts a fight. That is until Yrene, the barmaid, is closing down for the night. Three mercenaries pop out of the fog and grab her. Before long, though, two are dead and one is running for his life, and Celaena saves the day. Celaena then decides to teach Yrene a few self-defence movements in case she is ever cornered again. I really enjoyed this story, although it felt much shorter than The Assassin and the Pirate Lord . Everyone who has read the Throne of Glass series knows that Celaena isn't a girl's girl. As in, she finds it difficult to become friends with girls and finds it much easier to befriend boys. So the short story where Celaena temporarily befriends Yrene was really nice to read, and even the ending was a little bittersweet as they both went their separate ways. The Assassin and the Desert. 4.5 stars! \"If you can learn to endure pain, you can survive anything. Some people learn to embrace it\u2014to love it. Some endure it through drowning it in sorrow, or by making themselves forget. Others turn it into anger.\" The Assassin and the Desert has to be my favourite story so far. There's action and adventure, blushing-Celaena, Silent Assassins and definitely a lot of intrigue. It's a great story and I can see why it's many people's favourite -- we see exactly where Adarlan's Assassin became great, and how she honed the skills she learned in the desert alongside the Master of the Silent Assassins. Although, le sigh, still not Sam. Only one story with him and I miss him already T.T The Assassin and the Underworld. Five stars! \"I love you,\" he breathed against her mouth. \"And from today onward, I want to never be separated from you. Wherever you go, I go. Even if that means going to Hell itself, wherever you are, that's where I want to be. Forever.\" Whenever I hear the word \"underworld\", I think \"dark\", \"gritty\", \"violent\". The name itself makes me think that whatever I'm about to read or watch is going to be dark. In the case of this story, I was dead right. The Assassin and the Underworld is, technically, Celaena's breaking point. Everything she thought was true is suddenly revealed to be a lie and she finds herself questioning everything, including Arobynn himself. When Celaena is sent to retrieve some highly important documents, she's told it's because Arobynn has had a change of heart regarding slave trade, and Celaena couldn't be happier. Moreover, Arobynn has apologised to her for the way he treated her before sending her to the Red Desert and has invested precious gold in a wonderful new suit for both her and Sam. Things couldn't be better, right? Wrong. Because Sam is suspicious, and Celaena should be, too. When truths come to light, Celaena fights back against the man who saved her life, and believes her and Sam are finally free. Or are they? I'm pretty sure the last story is going to kill me so I expect a lot of chocolate, tissues and hugs upon my return. The Assassin and the Empire. FIVE HEARTBROKEN STARS. \"My name is Celaena Sardothien,\" she whispered, \"and I will not be afraid.\" *cries hysterically* DON'T TOUCH ME. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? DON'T BREATHE NEAR ME. JUST LEAVE ME ALONEEEEEE. ...more \"My name is Celeana Sardothien\" she whispered. \"And I will not be afraid.\" This book shattered me...I've never gone into a book with so much love mixed with absolute dread definitely a different reading experience. I purposely took my time reading this just because I wanted to spend more time with Sam and hold off on the heartbreaking ending we knew was coming... SAM. SAM. SAM. I loved him immediately and his relationship with Celeana was the cutest! They grew up together and really didn't \"My name is Celeana Sardothien\" she whispered. \"And I will not be afraid.\" This book shattered me...I've never gone into a book with so much love mixed with absolute dread definitely a different reading experience. I purposely took my time reading this just because I wanted to spend more time with Sam and hold off on the heartbreaking ending we knew was coming... SAM. SAM. SAM. I loved him immediately and his relationship with Celeana was the cutest! They grew up together and really didn't like each other until about halfway through the first novella then it just kept growing and it was so much fun to read..and they're banter was so sweet. \"Sam's hand brushed her shoulder and she almost jumped out of her skin as he brought his mouth close to her hear and murmured \"You look beautiful. Though I bet you already know that.\" She most certainly did. \" OF COURSE I FELL IN LOVE WITH SAM. OF COURSE I SHIPPED THEM AND OF COURSE IM DEVASTATED \"She would tuck Sam into her heart, a bright light for her to take out whenever things were darkest.\" STOP WHYYYY!! My heart broke for Celeana. She had so much hope and it all just came crashing around her. It was the saddest thing to read about... \"The girl who'd taken on a Pirate Lord and his entire island, the girl who'd stolen Asterion horses and raced along the beach in the Red Desert, the girl who'd sat on her own rooftop, watching the sun rise over Avery, the girl who'd felt alive with possibility..that girl was gone.\" But besides the dread and panic that I felt reading this book, I still had so much fun as got swept away with each story. It was so fascinating going back and seeing where Celeana came from and what she was like before Throne of Glass. I loved how all the novellas flowed together and it was really like one huge prequel book which was great because I just can't get enough of Celeana and this world! The other characters were really interesting as well and I really hope we hear from Ansel and even the Mute Master somewhere down the road and Celeana needs to KILL Arobynn! That ass needs to go down! Ugh I wish Sam would come back and I know it's crazy but apart of me is still hoping he's alive!! a girl can dream right? Chaol better fix my heart up in Heir of Fire because I really need him too but I know it's gonna be tough road for him after Crown of Midnight..but ahhh I'm excited! I missed him and Dorian but I loved the little cameo they made and the mention of the crown prince or captain had me freaking out because omg Dorian an Chaol hahaha Anyway this is a MUST READ if you love the Throne of Glass series or would like to get into it!

Years ago, when she was just an orphan living in the streets, she was recruited and trained by Arobynn Hamel, King of the Assassins. Throughout her teenage years, she rose in the ranks of the Assassin\u2019s Guild to become Arobynn\u2019s chosen successor, and turned into what she is now: the most feared assassin in Adarlan\u2019s empire. The Assassin\u2019s Blade is a collection of short stories set before the Throne of Glass main series, and their purpose is to introduce the protagonist Celaena and the world in which her story takes place. Each of the short stories has its own characters, locations and plot twists, but viewed as a whole they tell one single tale of Celaena Sardothien and her life prior to the events described in Throne of Glass . In The Assassin and the Pirate Lord , Celaena and her rival Sam are sent to cut a deal with an infamous pirate lord with whom Arobynn has made an agreement. But the deal reveals itself to be far more complicated than either of them had expected. I did not like this story much, especially because Celaena is first introduced as a spoiled brat whose arrogance and stupidity threaten both her life and Sam\u2019s. Rating: 2 stars In The Assassin and the Healer , Celaena is sent south to spend a month training with the Silent Assassins, as punishment for events that occurred in the first story, and en route to their desert fortress winds up in a tavern in a small village called Innish. There she meets a downtrodden young barmaid who has lost everything, and most of the story is filled with conversations between the two, and Celaena teaching the other girl how to defend herself. Despite being really short, this was actually a pretty good story. While there was little real action, the story added something to the setting and the atmosphere of the world in which the series takes place. Rating: 3 stars In The Assassin and the Desert , Celaena finally reaches the fortress of the Silent Assassins and begins her training under the steady gaze of the Mute Master. This story was particularly good because it included a lot of character development for our protagonist. Celaena learns a lot through the events of this story, and the characters and storyline introduced in the desert were a lot more interesting than the ones in the two first stories. Rating: 3 stars In The Assassin and the Underworld , Celaena returns to Rifthold, capital city of Adarlan\u2019s empire, and continues her service to Arobynn Hamel. As a trade delegation from the far side of the empire arrives in the city, a sinister plot unfolds, and the assassins are hired by a foreign noblewoman to deal with it. This was in my opinion the best story by far. Rifthold is the most interesting of the places we have been introduced to in this book, and the characterisation and storyline both were really good in this one. Rating: 4 stars In The Assassin and the Empire , Celaena and Sam are trying to move out of Rifthold to start a new life somewhere else. For that, they need lots of money, and a mysterious contract arrives with the promise of making them both rich. The only thing they need to do is to kill the most powerful crime lord in the city along with his right-hand man. This was almost as good as the previous story, except for the fact that the beginning was terribly dull. Still, it was an interesting tale with a great plot twist and an even better ending. Rating: 3.5 stars As a whole, this book was a positive surprise, and I must say I enjoyed it more than I thought I would have. It was also surprisingly light to read, even though I had expected it would be, and I didn\u2019t have any trouble with reading a hundred pages of this in one hour. While essentially a fantasy book, it has a lot of elements from the young adult genre, something that would normally put me off reading it. Still, I somehow enjoyed reading this one quite a lot. One of the reasons behind that is the fact that is that unlike a lot of other assassin protagonists in fantasy and YA, Celaena Sardothien is actually an assassin. She kills people for money. It does sound a bit strange to be praising a book for having an assassin who actually performs assassinations, but compared to a lot of other assassin novels, this one is actually quite good. ...more *struggles to breathe* maybe I'm being overly emotional but I'm kind of ugly crying because I knew what was gonna happen but it still fucking HURTS.

It gives so much background info I wish I knew before hand. Plus my fav, Lysandra is in this one for a little!! But anyway, now I'm sad I have to wait until /next year/ for another book by the amazing Sarah J. Mass and I'm not really feeling that but super excited anyway :) ...more Maybe a 4.7 im not sure yet. When i started this the only things that i knew was that it was a copilation of short stories and that there is an end with tears (well depends of the person you know but i sobbed). I remember how a lot of people that read Throne of Glass were saying that they couldn\u2019t see much of the old life of the protagoist so it was hard to tell or understand her feeling and her attitude or if she was just being dramatic about having an awful past.

The Assassin and the Pirate Lord: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (4/5) I was a relly nice way to get an introduction for all the character we didn\u2019t knew and it was awesome to see team Sam and Celaena working together all that badassery but still i felt i needed a bit more. The Assassin and the Healer: \u2605\u2605\u2605(3/5) Honestly this story was only to fill up the book an even if it was cool to see Celaena in action as always, i didn\u2019t like this story so much (what it did happen was that i learned some self-defence stuff i don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll work irl but hey i can try ) The Assasin and the Desert: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (5/5) This was just awesome i really loved every part of it. So many feelings with Ansel (view spoiler) [i was not able to attach so much to her character and even if at some point i liked her i never trusted completly in her. I did feel bad for Celaena when she realized that Ansel \u201cbetrayed\u201d her tho (hide spoiler) ] and i would have really liked to see Celaena in something with Ilias, not cheesy romance and stuff but just because of having fun. Just because. I do love Sam tho \u201cShe was fire, she was darkness, she was dust and blood and shadow.\u201d The Assasin and the Underworld: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (5/5) Again, this was amazing. And ugggghh i was so sure that Arobynn wasn\u2019t being that nice to Celaena just because he wanted \u201cforgiveness.\u201d Now for the other siDE SAM AND CELAENA, I JUST WANTED TO \u201cRain continued beating against the hall windows, a distant reminder that there was still a world around them.\u201d The Assasin and the Empire: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (5/5) I CRIED SO MUCH SINCE THE MIDDLE OF THIS UNTIL THE END. (view spoiler) [ It was weird because when Celaena finds out that Sam is dead and Arobynn shows her the body i didn\u2019t felt anything i was so sure that he was lying and Sam was going to come back. It was not until a few pages later that i started sobbing because i realized that he was actually dead (hide spoiler) ] Im really confused with this Arobynn thing like we know that he acted like a parental figure for Celaena and i never get to understand if at the end of this he was just seducing her or he actually had feeling for her because at some point in the end he says \u201cI don\u2019t like sharing my belongings.\u201d I mean what i am supposed to think of that? Now one thing i know for sure from Arobynn Hamel is: \u201cThe girl who'd taken on a Pirate Lord and his entire island, the girl who'd stolen Asterion horses and raced along the beach in the Red Desert, the girl who'd sat on her own rooftop, watching the sun rise over Avery, the girl who'd felt alive with possibility...that girl was gone.\u201d If you haven\u2019t started the Throne of Glass series yet i will recommend start from this because even if it was some scenes that were surprising i alredy knew some of the most important and instense parts of this book (since they give you little clues in Throne of Glass #1) so yeah start from this so you can have the hole package of emotions. Ps. I really don\u2019t care how narcissistic everyone think my miss Sardothien is like i would fucking die for have just a bit of that tbh. \u201cLife isn't easy, no matter where you are. You'll make choices you think are right, and then suffer for them.\u201d ----- Ahora me pueden dejar morir aqu\u00ed porfavor.

Instead of five completely different and random stories, you get five different stories that build up together for one event that ends up being the start of Throne of Glass . Overall, I really did enjoy this bind-up, but I enjoyed some stories much, much more than others. Some of the stories felt perfectly synced with this world, and others seemed a little pointless and forced. I will break down each short story, with links to their individual reviews on Goodreads. #0.1) The Assassin and the Pirate Lord \u2605\u2605\u2605 This first novella had so much potential. I would have given the premise of this story a solid five stars. I mean, Sam and Celaena working with pirates to discover what happened to three of their fellow assassins? What more could I ask for? Sadly, the pirate lord, Rolfe, and their mission fell a little short for me. I did love being reintroduced to Celaena, and just remembering how far she has came from this scared and arrogant sixteen year old. Sam was wonderful; I loved him from first glance and his back-story still breaks my heart. It was weird being actually introduced to Sam, because his memory has played such a big part in the series, it has just felt like I've always known him. Oh, and seeing Arobynn again made me feel a vast array of emotions, too. #0.2) The Assassin and the Healer \u2605\u2605 This was the novella that felt a little pointless to me. Because of Celaena's actions in The Assassin and the Pirate Lord , she is sent away on a punishment mission. While waiting for a boat to take her to her punishment, she is staying at the White Pig Inn, where she meets a very unique and kindhearted girl named Yrene. I really liked Yrene, and the little bit of her back-story that we received, but this novella just completely felt like filler for me. Maybe we will see Yrene in this series eventually, and then this story will be a lot more meaningful, but as it stands, this story felt the weakest in this bind-up. #0.3) The Assassin and the Desert \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 This novella follows Celaena on her punishment mission with the Silent Assassins. I really liked this story, and it actually is pretty thought provoking on the subject of abuse. Even though we are watching Celaena try to get a letter of recommendation for the Mute Master, we also get to see her inner struggle dealing with her own abusive master. Celaena is now seventeen and realizing all the abusive things that have happened in her life are not normal or okay. Celaena also befriends a young girl named Ansel, and I absolutely devoured her story-arc. Ansel is another character that I pray we get to see in this series eventually. Because of Ansel's story-line we get to see an Ironteeth witch and spider silk, both of which play a huge role in the newer installments of this series! #0.4) The Assassin and the Underworld \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Be still, my heart. This novella was everything I wanted from this bind-up and more! Celaena is finally back in Rifthold after her three month journey away. Celaena and Sam discover how much they missed each other, and after a few high sexual tension scenes, they realize how much they like each other. Celaena is able to buy both of their freedom, and they want nothing more than to spend the rest of their life together. Rowan who, again? And freakin' Lysandra is in this story! Her and Celaena are just starting to hate each other, but, oh my gosh , it was so amazing to see these girls at seventeen, knowing how their paths will eventually twists together into something beautiful. Also, Arobynn is such a gross man! #0.5) The Assassin and the Empire \u2605\u2605\u2605 I love all the scenes in Celaena and Sam's apartment. Oh, how I wish things in this story could have gone differently. We get to see all the filth that goes on in the Vaults, and, unfortunately, Sam is making money fighting there. Sam wants to leave Rifthold very badly, and even though Celaena is unsure, she agrees. They pay Arobynn a huge sum of money to leave his assassin's guild, but Sam wants to finish one last mission on Rifthold before they leave the whole continent. We've all read Throne of Glass , so we all know how this turns out. That doesn't make the events that take place any less heartbreaking. That white stag though. I gave this novella bind-up 3 stars overall, because out of a possible 25 stars (5 stars possible for each of the 5 stories) this bind-up accumulated 17 stars (68%) .

Also, sometimes novellas need to be read in a certain order, in conjunction with the regular books, or you might end up getting an unwanted spoiler. This collection doesn't function that way. You could read it like I did, after reading the other books, to get a better understanding of Celaena. Or you could read it before , as an introduction to the character and her world. I'm not going to get all spoilery, so I'll just say that this tells the story of what happened to Celaena in the months leading up to her stint in the salt mines. Her relationship with the mysterious character, Sam, who has been often mentioned in the previous books, is finally revealed. Pull out the hankies, ladies! You're about to have your heart broken. Celaena's twisted mentor, Arobynn, features prominently in these stories, as well. At long last, the exact role he played in her fate is brought to light in The Assassin and the Empire . And, believe me, if you are a fan of these books, you're gonna wanna know what he did. The weakest story was The Assassin and the Healer , because it was the only one that actually seemed like a filler novella. The others each uncovered a new layer of Celaena's backstory, and helped move the overall plot forward. It really made me want to go back and do a re-read of the other books, so I can prep for Heir of Fire!
