It is even rarer when the said sequel might just be better than its predecessor. Tripathi once again delves into Indian mythology and spins a fascinating tale around many of the names heard in tales told at our grandmothers' knees, portraying them as mere mortals. Last left, Shiva was about to launch an attack on the dreaded Nagas to avenge Brahaspathi's death. The book's blurb gives you enough indication, and then some, that Shiva's plan might not be that easy to execute. His desire, and ours, for answers takes him all across India in this book, with the city in focus being Kashi. I'll give the book this, the author has good command over the story and doesn't let it meander, with something or the other always afoot. Filled with secrets, shocks and betrayal, this book is a page-turner from start to finish. The reveal of the Naga's identity was shocking, to say the least. I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING, PEOPLE! The \"secret\" of the Nagas, however, was something I had long suspected so I wasn't blown away by the \"cliff-hanger\". As for that Master Pupeteer, I think it's (<---B>view spoiler</---B>) [Bhrigu (hide spoiler) ] . There's a suspicious character if there ever was one! But, the book is not perfect either. Many issues are brought up and then never addressed again, or explained properly. For example, the awfully gross \"ritual\" the Branga people perform in Kashi - what is THAT about? Or this mysterious plague that seems to affect them, nothing is mentioned as to what it is or why it is happening or how it started and it is never brought up again after that chapter. Sati annoyed me a bit in this book. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't be OK with leaving my 6-month old son and going off to fight lions or planning a break-in because I'm wondering what the King of Kashi is up to when he disappears mysteriously into his palace every now and then (BOUNDARIES, woman!). Anandamayi, however, was a delight to read about. I couldn't help but grin every time that feisty, saucy girl sauntered onto the page! The author often uses the story to put forth his opinion on many issues - like Karma, ethics, consequentialism, existentialism and the balance of Good and Evil. Though it is clearly intended to make you think, sometimes it does get a bit too much. What I also found jarring was the use of certain words/phrases that didn't quite match with the era the book is set in. I get that the author has tried to give the story as modern a take as possible, but I can't quite digest the fact that these people know of \"radio waves\" and \"accumulator machines\" OR that they say things like \"You're a 180-year old virgin??\" (Was anybody else reminded of Twilight here? No? Just me? OK.<---F>) and \"I never understand their mumbo-jumbo\"</---F>. But maybe that's just me. Recommended. Go read. Now. ...more I feel like I just finished reading one of the Star Wars installments. With Shiva as Anakin, Sati as Padme, unexplored regions with strange inhabitants with secrets and continuous travels... The book was just too formulaic. That is not to say that it is not a good read - it is just that I was expecting the second book to be better than the first in some ways at least, and quite frankly, it is not. How Amish managed to construct a whole sequel on such a flimsy basic premise is beyond me. (view spo I feel like I just finished reading one of the Star Wars installments.

How Amish managed to construct a whole sequel on such a flimsy basic premise is beyond me. (view spoiler) [And the liberties he took with the plot and the myths are not easy to forgive either... The entire series essentially boils down to single mythological point - the Shiva-Ganesh showdown - the entire story is an elaborate construct to lead towards that, which was disappointing, especially since that too never happens after all that buildup. And the secret? It is just that Brihaspati is alive and working for the Nagas, which only means that the Nagas are on Shiva's side. Now that was obvious from the first book and was no \"secret\". And the author gives the impression that all the gods of India who are symbolically given strange forms were actually mutants/deformed Nagas and were deified later. That is too much to swallow even if we play along and accept his version of the Shiva myth (hide spoiler) ] Overall, the story is good, the new take is innovative and refreshing at times, but the narrative style, especially during the abundant action sequences is amateurish and repetitive. Glibly written, without much attention to the nuances of the mythology or to known historic facts, the book still manages to be a good, smooth story. Easy to read and enjoy, it truly is an amar chitra katha in novel form as the cover proudly(?)boasts... While the book makes for a fun fast read, I cannot in good conscience recommend it without telling that anyone who picks up the book looking for literary enjoyment is going to be terribly disappointed, but if all that is needed is a way to pass a few hours, then it might be worth it. Surely it will make a good movie someday, with the disappointing and predictable plot twists that is characteristic of most Bollywood movies.

Taking an Indian God like Shiva with multiple facets to his persona and coming up with such an elaborate tale takes a different kind of imagination. Having grown up hearing stories about Gods like Shiva, Vishnu, Rama, Krishna etc curiosity was the one thing that drew me towards the first book in the series. But the curious thing about this book is that even though you want to be surprised and confronted with out of the world conspiracy theories I still maintain that this book is a great concept.

Having grown up hearing stories about Gods like Shiva, Vishnu, Rama, Krishna etc curiosity was the one thing that drew me towards the first book in the series. But the curious thing about this book is that even though you want to be surprised and confronted with out of the world conspiracy theories with each turn of the page it is the very same predictability that keeps you hooked. Be that in the case of Shiva's marriage, his friendship with Nandi, Bhagirath and Veerabhadra or any other stories associated with his myth, the fun part of the book is seeing how each story fit into place. For me this was the fun part but now that brings us to the next question. What about a person who has not yet heard of Shiva or his story? Will this person find the book enjoyable? This is not a book for such a person. In such a case the person tends to evaluate the book on the basis of the writing and that leaves much to be desired. <---A>Amish Tripathi</---A> is more of a conversationalist than a writer. His creative energy seems to be high when his characters are engaged in conversations but that doesn't also prevent his dialogues from being a little childish. All the philosophies about life, good and evil etc are engaging but it has a distinct Yoda to Skywalker kind of conversation aura that you learn nothing new from the venture. One thing I did find odd though was the ease with which people fall at the feet of Shiva. He is supposed to be an ordinary man in this book. But that promise is not delivered, it seems Shiva became a legend because he was already a legend which doesn't make the slightest sense. Also even the strongest opposition is won over by Shiva's humility, without even a second thought. The constant reference to India is also nerve racking as there was no India at that time and that undermines much of the credibility in this story. The story however is more or less the same. We have Shiva who is prophesied as the destroyer of evil but having trouble understanding the true evil. Since the Chandravanshi threat has been taken care of the only thing that can now be considered evil is the feared Nagas. But are the Nagas truly evil or are they just misunderstood?. As Shiva searches for answers he comes across shocking revelations that may change everything. Even though \"<+++>The Secret of the Nagas</+++>\" try to bring as many twist and turns as possible to the story you can smell all the big twists from a mile away so these twists are not the highlight of this book. So don't expect to be surprised, what you can expect however is an enjoyable read which keeps your attention despite the flaws. ...more The second novel in Amish's Shiva Trilogy series and it steals the show by revealing the most shocking yet pleasant tight-lipped remains of The Immortals Of Meluha. _/\\_ As I already mentioned, this book is strictly not for those who believe in Lord Ram's ways of ruling, saivism or Shiva Puran and that intrigued me to proceed with the sequel.

And it did not disappoint me, not even a bit of it. Shiva seeks justice for the death of his friend Brihaspathi, and as fate unfolds, he travels to Panchavati, the land of Nagas through the dense Sundarbans & Dhandakaranya led by the Nagas queen and the Lord Of People. As the secrets are revealed, friends becomes foes and foes are categorized as alliances. Karthik and Ganesh are added into the story-line adding spices along with the usual ingredients, Sati, Veerbadhra, Krittika, Bagirath, Parvateswar, Suryavanshis, Chandravanshis and the Nagas. And not to forget the mighty Brahmin Parasuram creeps in to help the Mahadev while lovely Anandamayi makes Parvateshwar, the 180 year virgin, to break his vow ;) The jaw-dropping connection between the Nagas & Sati took me to the state of excitement, anger, shock, disappointment, sympathy, grieve, raging and all emotions at once for the abandoned Nagas. When the ultimate secret was revealed, i sat dumb-struck. All my guesses went in vain. What really captivated me was that the secret itself was speaking about illusions or Maya. What intrigues me now to read \"The Oath Of Vayuputras\" is the secret that Krittika shares with Ayurvati and the secrets that the secret itself should reveal to Shiva. Undoubtedly, this book has paved way for some grand magnificent ending to the story of the masculine tribal man, who elevated him self to be the MahaDev. And The reverbration of \"Har Har Mahadev\" won't stop until I finish of oath Of the Vayuputras. Amish Tripathi, am certain that you are an sensation. I'm too excited to grab the final part, and before that let me breath IN and OUT first. ...more YUCKS....!!!!!!!! really....?? did I read it?? I mean... seriously ????

But my ratings are always based on how intensely a book affects me, and as frustrating as it is to admit, this book did not affect me in any way. I tried; I really, truly tried. Considering how disappointing the first book was, I kept my expectations low this time around. I pretty much ignored the clumsy writing and the clich\u00e9d characterisation, keeping my focus only on the story. I hoped that would make me like this book better than its predecessor. But it just didn\u2019t work. Battles were being fought, and I didn\u2019t care. People died, and I didn\u2019t care. Surprises were being revealed, and I didn\u2019t care \u2013 probably because I figured them out way early. (view spoiler) [(I deduced by page 50 that the Naga man was probably Sati\u2019s first-born son. And I always suspected Brahaspati was alive, since his body was never found. I mean, isn\u2019t that the golden rule of Bollywood??) (hide spoiler) ] Even the humour felt painfully contrived. Also, I could never really picture this in my head. The characters never felt like real people, and since I couldn\u2019t visualise them, I couldn\u2019t empathise with them. There was an instant when I just couldn\u2019t make myself read any further, because doing so seemed increasingly like a chore. And the eye-roll moments definitely didn\u2019t help. (view spoiler) [(Like how every new character just has to fall down on his knees before Shiva and cry copious amounts of tears . And when Kartik is born and Shiva picks up Ayurvati in his arms and swings her in a circle ... Cringe-worthy.) (hide spoiler) ] I would still say this: The imagination gone into crafting this story is spectacular. So please don\u2019t let my review change your mind about giving this one a go. So the book didn\u2019t work for me. Sad. Doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t work for you. Besides, The Shiva Trilogy is multitudes above the insipid, tacky love-stories that so many Indian authors regularly churn out. And for that alone, it at least deserves to be read.

I found some things predictable, but am not complaining about those in any way. Very well written. Again, I couldn't put the book down till I was finished reading it. In some ways, the predictability is because of the fact that, once you're about a third into the book, it hits you that Amish has found this really cool way of retelling tales from Indian mythology; through an engaging, witty and insightful set of stories.

In some ways, the predictability is because of the fact that, once you're about a third into the book, it hits you that Amish has found this really cool way of retelling tales from Indian mythology; through an engaging, witty and insightful set of stories. You realise that you already knew all these characters. Parshuram, the man who beheaded his mother. Kali, the goddess known for her legendary temper. Each of the characters is one of the several familiar, if not beloved gods of childhood-stories-heard-on-grandmother's-knee :) You make this realisation at any point in the book. For me, it hit me when Kartik was born. Sati's second born. Amish conveniently named him Kartik. So my mind automatically told me there *must* have been a Ganesh too. And then all the pieces clicked into place. Sati's previous child, whom she was told was a still-born. The Nagas not being of standard human appearance. Daksha and Veerini's previous reactions. Most things that were left unexplained in some previous passages. But realising this does not take away much from the pleasure of reading the book. The way each character is developed by Amish and the way the story itself unfolds makes the book a very enjoyable read. What I particularly liked was the fact that Amish does a Kurosawa-esque justification of the actions of every character he portrays. You get to see the same story from each protagonist\u2019s point of view, adding depth to each character. Also, this has to be said: there certainly is a feel-good aspect to these books. One that you\u2019re willing to live with because (apart from the actual fact that it does make you feel good while reading the story) you\u2019ve been transported back to some place in your childhood. And here, the security of knowing that good will (eventually) triumph over evil makes the reading more enjoyable. [Aside: I\u2019m not quite sure this would apply to people who\u2019ve not grown up hearing these stories (in whatever modified form). But then again, most of us grow up with one set of mythological stories or another. :)] What I also am *extremely* thankful for, is that, nowhere in the book does the tone get preachy (that would irk me no end) or patronising. This is one of the few major reasons I\u2019d disagree with anyone comparing Amish to Paulo Coelho. The extent of my liking for this book can be gauged by this: I\u2019ve even managed to tolerate the constant chants of \u201cJai Shri Ram\u201d throughout the book. The significance of this fact is that my personal opinion of Ram, is er.. Hmm. Well, this forum is not appropriate for me to start on that rant, let alone the kind of adjectives that might ensue. Suffice to say that my dislike for that character is quite marked. So having said all that, I am now awaiting the release of the third book in this trilogy. I do hope it lives up to the previous two books and ties up all those loose ends along the way as beautifully as has been done up until now. :) ...more The one reason, I read through the series, though incomplete, is the very serious romanticized take on a mythological figure.

It\u2019s a series of very predictable disclosures that unfold through a chain of events. The only surprise for me as a reader was the very last part of the text, where in typical television serial style; the dead come back to life. We wait for the third book in the series to see how this humdrum narrative comes to an end. My only favored element in the book, Shiva.

The first book ended abruptly in midst of a battle which was a clever strategy deployed by the author. But this sequel was worth a shot. The Shiva Trilogy 2: The Secret of The Nagas came with a expanded map of India showing us the territory of the \"evil\" Nagas. Rarely one comes across a sequel better than its predecessor. And this book can be surely counted as one of them. Every line of the book catapaults into opening Well Bose and I couldn't resist getting the sequel to The Immortals of Meluha.

And this book can be surely counted as one of them. Every line of the book catapaults into opening a new secret. Generally a book opens up with the author thanking his family and friends. This one opened up in a similar manner The lines were so few, but they sunk deep inside my heart .. Unlucky are those who search the seven seas for paradise Fortunate are those who experience the only heaven that truly exists, the heaven that lives in the company of our loved ones I am truly fortunate Apart from the main story-line of Shiva finding and destroying the Nagas. This book also had some small parallel stories which were equally interesting. Notable one was that of Princess Anandmayi trying hard to win over General Parvateshwar who had taken a vow of brahmacharya , an open-ended word of honour that can never be broken. The description of the gates of kingdom Branga [conjugate of Brahmaputra and Ganga] was nothing less than a fine example of an engineering marvel. The arrival of Ganesh and Kali left me speechless. Their character portrayal was simply way ahead for an Indian author. But what moved me the most was the very small story in 'The Curse of Honour'. The story was that of Parshuram which definitely reminded me of the honour killings rooted in our society. Hats off to Amish for this one ! Some of the awesome lines in this book were .. \"I know this is not entirely right. But sometimes, the only way to prevent a grave wrong is to commit a small wrong.\" - Parvateshwar [A Small Wrong?] \"It's true that Gods don't give all abilities to one person. You truly are your own worst enemy.\" - Naga Queen [What is Your Karma] \"Gold means nothing. We have tonnes of it back home. It still cannot buy us out of our suffering. Nothing is more important than life. Nothing. You realise the simplicity of that point only when you confront death everyday.\" - Divodas [Even a mountain can fall] \"Lord Rudra said judge a person by his karma, not his appearance.\" - Athithigva [The Mystery of the Eastern Palaces] Few excerpts from the book are ... \"How does it work? How is it that I can hear your thoughts?\" \"Its a simple science really. The science of radio waves. Just like light, which helps you to see, there are radio waves to help you hear. While all humans can easily use the properties of light to see, most don't know how to use radio waves to hear. We are dependent on sound waves to hear. Sound waves travel much slower through air and for much shorter distances. Radio waves travel far and fast, just like light\" - Birth Pangs [Pg110] Truth doesn't ask for belief. It just exists. Let me hear what you think. There is god in every single one of us. What is the obvious corollary? There is evil in every single one of us. Exactly, there is god in every single one of us. And there is evil in every single one of us. The true battle between good and evil is fought within. - Birth Pangs [Pg112] The hump caused by the injury restricted Uttanka's right arm's movements. \"You will not be able to battle a taller man.\" \"I will die before retreating, My Lord,\" said Uttanka. \"I have no use for soldiers who die. I need soldiers who will kill and live.\" - The Mating Dance [Pg127] You were my world, my God, my creator, And yet, you abandoned me. I didn't seek you, you called me, And yet, you abandoned me. I honoured you, lived by your rules, coloured myself in your colours, And yet, you abandoned me.

It was interesting to see how Tripathi brought in Nandi, Veerbadra and other mythological characters to life. Hence I pre ordered this book. It was a disappointment. Shiva, from being a man confused of his destiny in the first book, becomes an all powerful superhero, almost like Captain Vijayakanth.

Shiva, from being a man confused of his destiny in the first book, becomes an all powerful superhero, almost like Captain Vijayakanth. He never gets hurt, none of his followers get hurt or killed (except for one janakaraj like character), nobody is wrong but every one has different view points - it started resembling a tamil masala movie. From the first book, Tripathi builds up the image of the Naga as some one besotted with Sati / Parvati. So I assumed that he will turn out to be one of the asuras whom Sati kills, may be Makishasura. So it came as a jolt when it turned out to be Ganesha, who in all our myths has been a jolly good fellow, not the intense character that Tripathi makes him out to be. Personally it offended my Tamil senses that Murukan / Karthikeyan is shown to be a north indian prince. Most probably in the next book, Murukan will settle down to rule the Nagas (who I assume are Dravidians) as Shiva goes back to his abode in Kailash. I have always thought that Murukan was a Tamil king who was worshipped by Tamilians and the Saivite religion later accommodated him into their pantheon. I understand that my assumption is a myth too. No one can be sure of whether it happened like Tripathi wrote or as I assume, still it grates to have my assumptions questioned without the other side giving a logical reason. All in all the trilogy is an interesting idea that could have been a Umberto Eco kind of novel, but ends up being Thiruvilayadal movie. (Apologies for the Tamil movie references) ...more Loved it!

And one more thing, this part totally turns the user impressions of the good vs evil, u will suddenly find good turning to evil and evil turning out to be good! We will end up almost as confused as Shiva himself ;) One rouse is that i thought this book diverged from known 'facts' of Hindu mythology by a significant amount. Am not an expert on the Hindu mythology, so maybe it's just my impression! A must read to those who liked the first part! ...more Part 2 of the Shiva Trilogy. Shiva continues his journey from Meluha into Swadeep, after managing to broker a peaceful arrangement between the Suryavanshis and Chandravanshis. He then shifts his focus to what he considers a common threat, and a fount of evil - the Nagas. His search for the Nagas takes him into the Chandravanshi kingdoms and brings him in touch with various populaces who have ties with the Nagas. As the book progresses, events force Shiva to reconsider his belief in the Vasudevs Part 2 of the Shiva Trilogy. Shiva continues his journey from Meluha into Swadeep, after managing to broker a peaceful arrangement between the Suryavanshis and Chandravanshis. He then shifts his focus to what he considers a common threat, and a fount of evil - the Nagas. His search for the Nagas takes him into the Chandravanshi kingdoms and brings him in touch with various populaces who have ties with the Nagas. As the book progresses, events force Shiva to reconsider his belief in the Vasudevs as well as his stance on the Nagas, and towards the end, he begins his journey into the land south of the Narmada \u2013 the abode of the Nagas. The book sees the birth of Karthik, Shiva\u2019s son, as well as other popular Hindu mythology characters \u2013 Ganesh, Kali, Parashuram etc. The author, as with the first book, tries to find a logical explanation to the mythological portrayals, though he does take a lot of creative liberties. Book 2 also ends with revelations and a set of questions which most likely will be answered in The Oath of the Vayuputras. I felt that the prose and the style had definitely improved from the first volume, though I still found the rampant use of modern day phrases and expressions by mythological characters a put off. Once again, the narrative is paced well, and there is no dearth of imagination. I\u2019ll definitely be waiting for the third volume and the \u2018master puppeteer\u2019. ...more the book is dissapointing to say the least,,, the author is in too hurry to declare his character as great,, there plans as marvellous and there actions as something of legendary,, what he lacks is writing,, either he believes that reader to too busy to read the character buildup, or he believes reader would be idiot enough to accept any structure to be divine just because author say it so... means what is point of writing it if u not bother to describe it to the full details,,, one of the main s the book is dissapointing to say the least,,, the author is in too hurry to declare his character as great,, there plans as marvellous and there actions as something of legendary,, what he lacks is writing,, either he believes that reader to too busy to read the character buildup, or he believes reader would be idiot enough to accept any structure to be divine just because author say it so... means what is point of writing it if u not bother to describe it to the full details,,, one of the main strong point of fantasy + Fiction + Myth is the amount of details that r provided (while still leaving a lot to imagination),,, author simply lacks that,,, he seems to be in a hurry to finish the book... people who r used to LOTR or other big fantasy fiction series (specially those who want there character to be developed in front of them and r not afraid of going through so called voluminous will be highly dissapointed by this book). the book is good for the people who wants to boast that they have read a triology/fantasy/fiction saga. in my honest opinion this whole TRIOLOGY could have been summed in one book easily, given the kind of haste author shows in finishing a scene/sequence,,, and the amount that hes writing I m sure he will come up with next part ASAP as he might wanna cash on the sort of buzz that the book has created... ...more Last night, at 10-30, just before my weary head hit the pillow, I felt the need to read, or at least start reading a book. It's nothing unusual, and I'm sure that bibliophiles would be thoroughly acquainted with the feeling, and it's consequences.

Although the first book in the Shiva trilogy had ended in quite a cliffhanger, I had refrained from diving into the second book until then. But for some reason, last night I picked up that one. It was 02-30 in the morning when the book was finished. I switched off the light, but sleep remained elusive for a long time. As a thundershower raged outside, I remained wrapped up in the multi-coloured and multi-textured quilt woven by Amish. Amish's works have been compared with those of several authors. To me, his work seems to be a perfect conjugation of an Arthurian quest and everything Bollywood. But I also think that he is, till date, the only author who has given us something similar to the legendary works of R.E. Howard, using Indian mythology to create a world that's purely fictional, and yet strangely familiar because of it's juxtapositioning of known geography onto mythical notions. Add to that a very simple language, and a proper thriller unfolding over multiple books, and you have something that's unputdownable. Highly Recommended. ...more Finally I picked up this much-awaited sequel to the book \u2018The Immortals of Meluha\u2019 and, boy, I wasn\u2019t disappointed.

The sequel arrived after I had almost forgotten the plot of its predecessor, but the thrill and adventure, as well as the unique plotline made it all rush back into my brain\u2019s core. The book begins where the previous installment ends \u2013 Shiva and Sati chasing their assailant. The adventure that starts at the first page, ends only in the last page, with adrenaline oozing out of every page, with some high-packed action. What if Lord Shiva was once just a normal, mortal human being but was later exalted to the status of a God due to his deeds and destiny? The trilogy attempts to weave an interesting story based on this idea and the author has done a fairly good job, considering that this is his maiden attempt in writing a book of this magnitude. The story takes Shiva, his family and friends across the country in search of the evil \u2013 or are they \u2013 Nagas and their kingdom. With so many unexpected twists in the plot, if I say anything more, I might spoil the fun of reading the book. A book like this deserves to be completed in one sitting. The book is a must-read if you are looking for razzmatazz plotline with a lot of action and adventure to pass your time. But don\u2019t expect anything beyond that. Of course, the author gives us a glimpse of his philosophical quests in some pages and they are worth delving into. In fact, I picked up a wise thought \u2013 no one is completely evil. It is all about perspective. The book has some sloppy sides though. The anachronism over the presence of a liger \u2013 I am not certain that any ligers were around in the period 4000 BC, the people using some of the modern day swearwords and such minor issues. Also, many a while, he breaks the suspense well in advance. He ends up giving more than enough hint so that when he reveals the identity of a character, you don\u2019t find any suspense or thrill at all. Also, Anandamayi\u2019s advances to Parvateshwar aren\u2019t lovely but lewd. The purity of the love that binds Shiva and Sati is entirely missing in their \u2018love\u2019 affair and this woman ends up acting like the modern day heroines who think that the only way to make a hero love them is to shed their clothes. Unsavory! But compared to the fun of the author\u2019s idea of bringing some contemporary persona in the book \u2013 like Bappi Raj, who reminds you of Bappi Lahari, with his heavily built physique and obscenely adorning jewelry \u2013 and his commendable play around words and legends, you won\u2019t find these glitches in anyway impeding. Overall, a good book to spend time with. I am now awaiting the final installment in this trilogy! ...more ** Books 311 - 2016 ** 3,4 of 5 stars! Wow Finally i know who is the secret behind the naga being revealed in this books! Finally i've met Ganesh, Sati's another Son :D Actually i'm curious with the last books The Oath of the Vayuputras but i think i should read another books first since i'm kinda bored to read marathon this books trilogy :') The author had tons of source material in the form of the Hindu Mythological texts, yet spends little time writing an elaborate modern day explanation for it all. Since he did set out trying to give a plausible and valid interpretation to the legend of Lord Shiva, he should not deviate from that path by grossly altering the holy texts.

Some creative liberties are allowed but this is not Harry Potter where the entire world was born out of JK Rowling's imagination. Amish should really have tried to keep the story relevant and maintain the impact. The first book ended very abruptly and nowhere gave the satisfaction of a complete read. For a tribal warlord's story, the author does surprisingly little to explain elaborate war scenes ar fight sequences. More time, instead, is spent upon giving farce scientific explanations for unnecessary minute details. This book is more of a quick decision by the author to make some money by extending the story rather than a genuine effort at a plot. If you have already started with the trilogy, might as well read on but it won't leave you reminiscing an awesome story. ...more To quote from another review - \" good concept but bad execution \". The 1st part of the trilogy had a novelty when Amish tried to reinterpret the stories and myths, but it does'nt remain so this time around.

Amish also has a very annoying way of ending the books in \"cliffhanger\" moments. He wants to have a twist or so in the last paragraph or the last sentance of the book. Hopefully he corrects it in future novels. ...more this was a good book to read during free time Though some chapters seemed out of the flow but nearing the end,it all starts to connect. If one thinks that this book is the end and there is nothing twisty ahead....its time to think again.the oath of vayuputras is gar beyond what you expect.even though its fatter than others and has way too many chapters but I hope its worth a read... Frankly,the immortals of Meluhas was more captivating than the secret of the nagas for me. :) While I confess that I read the book in almost one go, and I did enjoy it while reading it, in hindsight I am left slightly disappointed. While the story flows nicely, there are a number of let downs - the descriptions and settings start to get monotonous, the awe factor is gone because things are overused, and at times it feels like enough research/thought has not been given to some things. Still worth reading though, it's not too long and the story is interesting. Stuffed with thrill, adventure and action, the sequel takes you deeper in the Shiva trilogy that gets better and better. The Secrets of the Nagas are really intriguing and give you more than what you\u2019re seeking. As good as or rather even better than the first part.. recommended for all hindus.. Discover the actual facts(actually fantasy) in Hindu mythology the twists and turns were really unexpected. .loved it though The whole trilogy goes straight downhill from here. Terrible terrible stuff. Keep away. Save your money. \"The Secret of the Nagas\" is a worthy sequel to the spellbinding \"The Immortals of Meluha\", which I've completed recently & reviewed here. http://t.co/AU5OGp8C While Lord Shiva's character is already established to the level of him being worshiped as a Mahadev (God of Gods) in the first part of the Shiva Trilogy itself, young author Amish still manages to keep the sequel as a page-turner with vivid vistas of the great nation of Sapt Sindhu (the land of 7 rivers or India, as we know it), its de \"The Secret of the Nagas\" is a worthy sequel to the spellbinding \"The Immortals of Meluha\", which I've completed recently & reviewed here. http://t.co/AU5OGp8C While Lord Shiva's character is already established to the level of him being worshiped as a Mahadev (God of Gods) in the first part of the Shiva Trilogy itself, young author Amish still manages to keep the sequel as a page-turner with vivid vistas of the great nation of Sapt Sindhu (the land of 7 rivers or India, as we know it), its deeply rooted culture, boundless wealth, engineering prowess and amazing people. If 'Har Har Mahadev' was the memorable war cry that left us craving for more in the first part, it is the even more mesmerizing 'Om Namah Shivay' in this part! The vistas of our great nation arise magnificently in front of our eyes are the great city of Kashi (with a clever explanation for its reputation of being the place where Hindus believe their souls will rest in peace), the magnificent Gates of Branga (an engineering marvel that's unimaginable even for today's engineers), the mysterious Sundarbhan and Dandak forests (nicely linking mother Goddess Kali to the eclectic city of Kolkata) that leads to Panchavati (where Ravan is said to have abducted Devi Sita leading to the decimation of him and his kingdom by Lord Ram) where the Nagas and their secret await Lord Shiva and the dense forest along river Madhumati where Lord Shiva confronts Parshuram! The stunning revelations continue from Part 1, with the best being the unveiling (literally) of Lord Shiva's elder son, the celebrated Lord Ganesh (also known as Lord Vinayaka, Ganapathy, Vigneshwara) and mother Goddess Kali! While Lord Shiva travels far and wide on his quest to find true evil, Lady Sati and Lord Ganesh get their own magnificent pieces of action! There's also a hint of what a fearsome warrior Lord Karthik would eventually become! Lord Shiva's third eye (known as Netrikkan in Tamil) also gets referred twice. My deep spiritual experience happened again when I saw Lord Ganesh and mother Goddess Kali for the first time (their depiction by Amish is that vivid), Lady Sati and Lord Shiva's unconditional acceptance of both of them and a glimpse of Lord Shiva's Rowthiram (fearsome anger). Those who're intrigued by Daksha's portrayal that's contrary to Shivapuran also get their much needed clarification! Other memorable characters that roam the pages of the sequel include the bewitching Anandmayi (who leaves the great General Parvatheswar toungue-tied), petrifying Parshuram (who truly lives up to his fearsome reputation), the Vasudevs (who continue to intrigue by toying with Lord Shiva's intellect), father-son duo of Drapaku (who lays down his life for his Lord) and Purvaka, Divodas and Bhagirath. Lord Brighu, considered a great sage, leaves us intrigued with his actions! Karthik (the young ravishingly handsome son of Lord Shiva, also known as Muruga, Skanda, Karthikeya, Subrahmanya, Kadirvela, Dhandapani, who also is my family God) grows up so fast that his mythical title of 'Thagappansamy' (one who taught his father) doesn't sound mythical! I'm very keen on seeing him grow up to his larger-than-life role of 'Devasenapathy' (General of the Devas) and perform the Soorasamharam (demolition of evil) and also travel to Lanka to romance Valli (which is my own theory based on my recent visit to SriLanka, one that Amish is free to use). It would also be of great interest to learn about his close link with South India, where he's a celebrated God even today! His future wife Devyani also finds a mention in this sequel. Several references to the revered and fearsome Lord Rudra (the Mahadev before Lord Shiva) who annihilated the Asuras and Lady Mohini (considered to be an avatar of Lord Vishnu) who helped him in that quest are also made in this sequel - including Lord Shiva's darshan of Lord Rudra in the Kashi Viswanath temple - indicating a possible large scale portrayal of the great Lord Rudra in the final part of the Shiva trilogy as it is titled \"The Oath of the Vayuputras\", which happens to be Lord Rudra's tribe (just as Gunas are Lord Shiva's). Another thing of keen interest will be how the sacred Rudraksha beed got associated with the Lord Shiva, his famed dance duel with mother Goddess Kali and his many Thiruvilayadal (literally God's games) in and around Madurai (my home town)! When Lord Shiva finally finds 'The Secret of the Nagas', it leaves us aching for the final part of the Trilogy! Now I've joined the legion of Lord Shiva's (and Amish's, of course) fans eagerly counting the days for publication of what could possibly be the most awaited conclusion of a Trilogy in recent times! ...more", "Title": "The Secret of the Nagas"},
