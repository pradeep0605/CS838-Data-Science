Some of these stories - \"Sunbird\", \"October in the Chair\", and \"How to Talk to Girls at Parties\" - appear in his excellent short story collection Fragile Things, and apparently others also appear elsewhere, mostly Smoke and Mirrors . Add to that, \"The Witch's Headstone\" is the precursor to The Graveyard Book . So, M is for Magic is really just a repackaging of old material. That's been a running theme in my Gaiman reading experience. He relies on source material too much. His stories are magical, even fantastical, but his ideas are old and used. Fairytales and mythology make up the subject matter of a good deal of the Gaiman canon. Much of it is straight up taken from preexisting sources with a modern day sensibility and scant, if any, new invention slapped on it in order to call it his own. It's genius! Fantasy is the IT genre these days and the people like their entertainment to come with some familiarity, thus the man has hit upon a winning formula. Few writers can claim the kind of unbridled popular success Neil Gaiman has achieved, so it could be argued that few if any could do better work within the realms of writing he inhabits. But I digress. Back to M is for Magic ! Whereas Fragile Things had decidedly adult content, this one gets no more racy than the suggestion of teens having \"a time good\" at a house party in \"How to Talk to Girls at Parties\". The rest is mostly stuff such as a crime noir version of nursery rhymes, a troll-under-the-bridge story, foodies in search of the ultimate meal, and a take on the quest for the Holy Grail in which an ordinary housewife finds the Grail at a thrift store and won't give it up to Sir Galahad because it looks nice on her mantel. (I could totally see one of the Pythons in drag playing the woman.) I'm not sure exactly what the appropriate reading age would be for these stories - I'm a childless middle-aged man, what the hell do I know? - they're not for tiny tots, but they could probably be read by nearly all other age levels, even old farts, and enjoyed in some way, shape or form. ...more I am not a fan of short stories. Once I get my teeth into a good book I want it to go on and on which is why I read a lot of series. However if I am going to read short stories then ones written by one of my favourite authors is the only way to go. This book contains some absolute treasures. A few of the stories use nursery rhymes as their source, a couple are almost science fiction and of course there is a lot of Gaiman's trade mark fantasy. Pure entertainment:) The problem with assigning a star rating to this book is that, like any book of short stories, it is a mixed bag. Especially considering that this particular book of stories is by Neil Gaiman who can pen novles that are original enough that the only resemblance they bear to one another is the name on the front cover. What I gather from this book (intended for a YA audience) is that Gaiman allows himself to get more experimental with stories than perhaps with his novel. As always, the writing is s The problem with assigning a star rating to this book is that, like any book of short stories, it is a mixed bag. Especially considering that this particular book of stories is by Neil Gaiman who can pen novles that are original enough that the only resemblance they bear to one another is the name on the front cover. What I gather from this book (intended for a YA audience) is that Gaiman allows himself to get more experimental with stories than perhaps with his novel. As always, the writing is superb. Sometimes, the stories edge on the likably bizarre. The only fair and scientific way to assignm this book a rating is to assign each story a seperate review and then average the outcome. 1) \"The Case of the Four and Twenty Blackbirds\"- This is the stupidest piece of Gaiman writing I have read yet. It is clever, but didn't grab me. The whole film noir meets nursery rhymes bit seemed rather silly. Don't let this story stop you from continuing to read. Thank heavens, it does get better. * * 2) \"Troll Bridge\"- This is a good adolescent short in that the symbolism is well done, but overt enough to be on the right level. It is not such a good adolescent story in it's discussion of sexuality and specific references to genitals. As an adult, I can appreciate this story; as a teen, I would have been distured by it. (I am a goodie two-shoes.) * * * 3) \"Don't Ask Jack\"- This is a great short short read. I would have loved and tried to emulate this short story a hundred times over in my own writing as an adolescent. As an adult, I know this isn't as transcendently amazing as Gaiman at his best. * * * 4) \"How to Sell the Ponti Bridge\"- The sci-fi setting is what makes this story borderline bizarre. There are some interesting details, still not my favorite. * * * 5) \"October in the Chair\"- This is Gaiman's tribute to Bradbury. (I would love to see Bradbury's response.) This is an interesting, thought provoking read. It seems like a warm-up exercise for The Graveyard Book . * * * * 6) \"Chivalry\"- Gaiman at his best. The strength of this story lies in both plot and characterization. I am completely enamored of it in every way and even more so because I listened to Gaiman's reading of it (available for free on-line- google it!) If you read only one story from this book, choose this one. It makes me wish I were teaching HS English all over again, because this story is worth sharing. * * * * * 7)\"The Price\"- I am, likewise, very fond of this story. I like the \"in medias res\" type ending. It reminds me a bit of Poe's \"The Black Cat.\" * * * * * 8)\"How to Talk to Girls at Parties\"- Once again, Neiman goes a bit sci-fi with this one. For anyone who has ever known or has ever been an awkward adolescent male, this story is a hilarious read. * * * * * 9) \"Sunbird\"- This story is very unusual and unpredictable. I seriously had no idea where it was headed until it had arrived. * * * * * for ingenuity. 10)\"The Witch's Headstone\"- This is actually one of the vignettes included in The Graveyard Book . As such, * * * * * 11) \"Instructions\"- This is not a short story, but a poem. Poetry is not exactly Gaiman's strong suite. This is a good piece or writing, but not amazing as poetry. * * * * (It is available as a youtube clip of Gaiman reading it. It is always well worth it to hear Gaiman read his own work.) ...more \u201e\u041a \u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e \u041a\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u201c \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e,

Seriously, I thought these stories were good enough, many of them, the first THREE times they were published. Five times, in at least one case, and possibly two. But there is not a single new story in this collection, folks. I almost titled this review \"R is for Ripoff.\" So, no original work. Maybe that would be okay if there were a good theme tying these together. The problem is the anthology's premise: somebody got to Neil Gaiman and said \"hey, you should publish an anthology o R is for Recycled.

Maybe that would be okay if there were a good theme tying these together. The problem is the anthology's premise: somebody got to Neil Gaiman and said \"hey, you should publish an anthology of your short stories for children.\" The problem: Gaiman has *never written a single short story for kids.* Not one of the stories in here is appropriate for any child under the age of 14, and I'd hesitate to offer most of them to anyone under the age of 17. That there isn't explicit sex in the story doesn't make it thematically or structurally appropriate for children, Publishing People. Not that this fact would have influenced you since fully half of the stories in this collection *DO* contain explicit references to sex. Gaiman has written some material arguably child appropriate ('The Graveyard Book' is on the edge, but 'Coraline' is quite good). Too often though, even when he tries, he can't help diving into themes entirely too dark (Stardust) or surreal (Wolves in the Walls) for actual kids. Kid-lit-friendly adults are his real target audience, and there's nothing wrong with that, if only he - and his publishers, would acknowledge it. H is for Honesty. ...more I am kind of annoyed. I had hoped for a nice collection of short stories to sink my teeth into. But instead I ended up skipping over a lot of stories I had previously read in this one. So I ended up only taking a few short hours on this one (I think it took me around 2) to finish up. For the really new to me stories I thought some were just okay, and others didn't make a lick of sense and did not appeal to me. The only really one I enjoyed was \"The Price\" and that featured a black cat. For those I am kind of annoyed. I had hoped for a nice collection of short stories to sink my teeth into.

The only really one I enjoyed was \"The Price\" and that featured a black cat. For those who are still looking to complete your Halloween book bingo, there are some stories in here for you that you may want to take a look at. \"The Case of the Four and Twenty Blackbirds\" (1 star). This was painful to read. I was tempted to have this story count towards the \"It was a dark and stormy night\" but decided to let that go. Told like a pulp detective novel featuring characters from children's nursery rhymes. Reading the word \"dame\" from Jack Horner (now a detective) made me roll my eyes. A lot. \"Troll Bridge\" (3.5 stars). I thought this one counted towards disturbing and sad in the end. A young boy comes across a troll that wants to eat his life. He manages to get away with a promise to come back. And he does come back. I thought one of his trips ended up sealing his fate so to speak (the young boy) because something that was innocent definitely curdled. \"Don't Ask Jack\" (3.5 stars). I thought this was a bittersweet story involving a jack in the box. The whole story made me feel lonely and sad. There is a reference to a moonlit night. \"How to Sell the Ponti Bridge\" (2 stars). Sorry. Could not get into this one at all. Reading about a special club of men I guess who end up being taken in by someone. I liked the illustration that came with this one. That's all I got. \"October in the Chair\" (skipped over, read previously). \"Chivalry\" (3 stars). A woman finds the Holy Grail and is visited by Sir Galahad. I think that there is a hint that the woman wants Galahad and that he kind of sucks for running off with someone else, but after reading about Merlin the other week, this book was a downer for me. \"The Price\" (5 stars). Featuring a black cat. I loved this one about the owner who starts to realize that a black cat that is now staying with him and his family may be more than what it appears to be. I have to say though I think I read this entire premise about a black cat in a Stephen King collection. Or from someone else. It has bugged me for a day now and maybe I will recall it down the road. \"How to Talk to Girls at Parties\" (skipped over, read previously). \"Sunbird\" (skipped over, read previously). \"The Witch's Headstone\" (skipped over, read this in The Graveyard Book). \"Instructions\" (4 stars). I liked this one a lot even though I haven't cared for Gaiman's poems in the past. The stories ultimately don't seem to have much of a connection between them.

Unfortunately I didn't enjoy the material quite as much. While I've never been a fan of twisted nursery rhymes (translation: I hate them; if you can't come up with original material you shouldn't be writing) Gaiman did a reasonably good job of making the Humpty Dumpty parody palatable (but just). When I got to the completely pointless second story about a troll I was impressed with Neil Gaiman for doing a great job narrating his own stories.

When I got to the completely pointless second story about a troll, I was more than a little disturbed that an author (any author) would feel the need to describe a magical creature's penis. I overlooked it, willing to give Neil the benefit of the doubt. Maybe all his great stories are at the end, I kept telling myself. Unfortunately the very next \"young adult\" story was about a thirteen year old boy that wanted to touch his best friend's breasts and \"maybe even put [his] hand between her legs.\" Am I the only one that thinks this is unnecessary? If you want to write dirty stories for adults, fine. But don't market your book to kids. Maybe I'm just old fashioned. Or maybe Neil is just a perv. ...more \u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0648\u062a\u0627\u0647\u060c \u0627\u0632

Enjoyable and exciting. \"Troll Bridge\" : it is not a story for children and leaves the reader with a sense of melancholy and desolation. \"Don't Ask Jack\" : a mini story about a mysterious spirit locked in a box, which I haven\u2019t found so disturbing. Maybe I should read it as a boy. \"How to Sell the Ponti Bridge\" : It's perhaps the most difficult to appreciate, because detaches itself from the gothic and sometimes melancholy atmospheres in which are immersed the other stories. However, it still bright and extravagant. \"October in the Chair\" : the twelve months of the year periodically gather in a circle to tell stories and each time one of them becomes the 'president' of the evening, which is responsible for making decisions and tell the final story. It\u2019s the time of October that tells a disturbing whose protagonist is a child and leave us a thousand questions about his fate. \"Chivalry\" : this is a story that makes you smile and where attention to detail reaches a high level, turning a lopsided smile to humans, with their quirks and weaknesses. \"The Price\" : it is perhaps the most obscure of all, and takes the concept of the clash between good and evil. \"How to Talk to Girls at Parties\" : Two boys invited to a party, but you can tell from the beginning that there is something deeply wrong with the characters. \"Sunbird\" : it uses an original idea, but if in your reading you stop and think for a minute, the end is predictable. \"The Case of the four and Twenty Blackbirds\" : in this novel Gaiman transforms the famous nursery rhyme of Humpty Dumpty in a mistery with hues noir. I liked the idea and the story is well developed. \"Instructions\" : an imaginative guide to enter the world of the fantastic. Not all stories will be appreciated, but with so many different genres I think we can meet most of the fans of Neil Gaiman. ...more I'm trying out audio (again), this time during my commute to work. My commute isn't bad, about 30 minutes, so a collection of short stories, written and read by Neil Gaiman no less, seemed like a good place to start. I was right! I'll say first of all that I love Gaiman's voice. I could listen to the man all day. I don't really have any other narrators to compare him to, but just the fact that I actually finished this audio book should be a testament to his greatness!

I'll say first of all that I love Gaiman's voice. I could listen to the man all day. I don't really have any other narrators to compare him to, but just the fact that I actually finished this audio book should be a testament to his greatness! I've read a lot of these stories in print, but I have to say that hearing Gaiman read them himself added a little something to the story. For example, I would never have \"heard\" the troll speaking in such a gray, tired voice if I had read it on my own. Hearing Gaiman's take on that really paved the way for the ending of that one. There were more examples, but that's the most striking. \"Four and Twenty Blackbirds\" reminded me a lot of Jasper Fforde 's Nursery Crime series. It's a very tangled, nursery rhyme noir PI story, which sounds like a big mess but was actually a lot of fun. \"Troll Bridge\" was a little eerie. I did not see the ending coming, but it made sense. It reminded me a little of another story of Gaiman's that I read in Fragile Things . I like this take on the theme better. \"Don't Ask Jack\" was probably my least favorite, just because there wasn't much story . It's a goose-bump-inducing little vignette though. \"How to Sell the Ponti Bridge\" was another I wasn't that crazy about. It was sort of a fantasy version of a ballsy scam. Not exactly my thing. \"October in the Chair\" is a story that I really liked in Fragile Things . I just like the imagery of the months of the year gathered around a campfire telling stories. The story October tells is somehow more sad for me than anything. \"Chivalry\" was one of my favorites. I loved the character of Mrs. Whittaker (sp? a reason I do like print books better). I can just see this lonely, crusty old lady who makes poor Galahad work for the Holy Grail. \"The Price\" is perfect for Halloween. I saw this whole story very clearly in my mind, and I felt so worried for the cat and the family. It always amazes me when well-written short stories can make me care about characters so quickly. \"How to Talk to Girls at Parties\" is just an odd story. I didn't care for it in Fragile Things , and I didn't care too much for it here. \"Sunbird\" is another one I've read elsewhere. I somehow lost the end of this on my ipod, so I can't say too much about it, but I do remember that it was not a favorite when I read it in print. \"The Witch's Headstone\"--the story that started The Graveyard Book . I love it in any format. I just love Bod and the witch, and I loved the book this grew into. \"Instructions\"--I don't think I liked this a whole lot when I first read it, but it has grown on me and I now love it. I love my illustrated edition, but I also love hearing Gaiman read it. This book is supposed to be a collection of stories for teens, and I do think it would work as an introduction to Gaiman for that age group. But I also just highly recommend it in general. ...more I don't think I'm meant to read short stories. I don't appreciate them, I suppose.

I enjoyed this book immensely. My personal favorite would be The Case of the Four and Twenty Blackbirds , a retelling of children's nursery rhymes, but which mainly told of the mystery of who murdered Humpty Dumpty.

[Okay, I'll give you just a few seconds here to recite the nursery rhyme to yourself... ;) ] Indeed, the nursery rhyme merely said Humpty Dumpty \"had a great fall\", but the truth was, as the story goes, he was actually killed... and his sister, Jill Dumpty, was paying a private investigator to look into it. Some stories were chuckle-inducing funny, like Chivalry , while some were a little darker and on the creepy side like Don't Ask Jack , a story about a jack-in-the-box that knows little children's secrets, How To Talk To Girls At Parties , the ending of which was left hanging and thus, open to interpretation, and Troll Bridge . The Price was a little sad, but still had that scary element nonetheless. The story of Bod (short for Nobody ) Owens, the boy who was raised by ghosts in a graveyard, and the spirit of the witch Liza, whose burial place had no gravestone, was lifted from The Graveyard Book . I enjoyed that story before, I enjoyed it no less this time around. It's nice to read short stories sometimes because, like what Neil Gaiman said, they allow you to read something that can be finished within the time that's available to you: short breaks from work, time spent on the road commuting, etc. It's even better when the stories are written by Neil Gaiman, whose rich imagination is, in my opinion, simply like no other writer's. I will definitely read more Gaiman. ...more Clive Barker tells us \"Gaiman is a star,\" but he sure is not shining in this book. Granted, some of the stories are entertaining.

The majority of these stories though are mediocre, and several are less than that. Furthermore, I wouldn't feel comfortable reading some of the passages aloud with my 7th grade students. (I.e. \"... and his penis hung from the bush of gonk hair between his legs...\" from The Troll Bridge or \"'Hiya, Cock.' '...Don't call me Cock...' 'Cock Robin is good enough for me, Cock...'\"\" from The Case of the Four and Twenty Blackbirds .) Really, overall the language wasn't too bad, but it was enough - and during the beginning stories that it turned me away from getting a set for my students. As I said, I did like some of the stories - I even liked The Troll Bridge . I just didn't have to know about his gonk-haired-penis. And a lot of the stories could have used some work ( How to Talk to Girls at a Party ) or left out altogether ( The Case of the Four and Twenty Blackbirds ). ...more I am usually a little wary around short stories and anthologies etc. But this one, I must say, was one of my favorites!

And then there was Don't Ask Jack, which was a story revolving around a jack-in-the-box, which gives you chills. Finally, there was The Witch's Headstone, which was a glimpse at Neil Gaiman's other book The Graveyard Book, which I had already read. But it was still nice to go reread an excerpt of it almost and know that at the end of it, there is much more to the story.

I liked none of the stories, all of them bored me to no end and I just don't have it in me to read on in hope of finding one I like. I did like the introduction of M is for Magic , though, especially because it offers this higly quotable quote: Stories you read when you're the right age never quite leave you. You may forget who wrote them or what the story was called. Sometimes you'll forget precisely what happened, but if a story touches you it will stay with you, haunting the places in your mind that you rarely ever visit.

These stories will please young folks as well as older ones and they make for a wondrous, quick read, so I definitely recommend the book. ...more On the whole these were nice enough stories - some stranger than others. None of them were incredibly memorable, but none of them were incredibly horrible, either. My favorite short story in this collection was Chivalry, followed by How to Sell the Ponti Bridge.
