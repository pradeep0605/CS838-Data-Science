Th During this book I was either Or Yes, it was a perfect mix of funny and sexy. Which, in my opinion, is something that doesn't come around often while reading erotica. So that's already one of the main reasons why enjoyed reading this story so much. \u2666 If you're going to read this book, I would suggest that you not read it in a train full of people, or any other public place for that matter. \u2666 Unless, of course, you don't mind people casting funny looks at you when you suddenly burst out laughing. Then I' suggest that you do read it in public. Going in this story, I had no idea what to expect, but it turned out to be a fun, refreshing and highly entertaining ride! It was the perfect kind of feel good-story that we all sometimes need between reading some of those darker, more depressing reads. ;) \u2666 Lex Easton is a New York fashion designer and a true Manhattanite. For years she's been buying the fabrics for her couture fashion line Easton Essentials from the Italian Giradoli Garment Company. Now, for some reason, the Girasoli Company has decided to cancel their business arrangement. But since they deliver the best materials and since New York Fashion Week is approaching, Lex is desperate to do whatever it takes in order to get her next shipment of fabrics. \u2666 Prince Massimo Tittoni is a notorious playboy whose numerous adventures appear almost daily in the world wide press. He's filthy rich, a little arrogant and sexy as hell. He's also the CEO of Girasoli Garment Company and therefore the person Lex needs to convince in order to maintain their business arrangement. So, in order to convince the Prince, Lex has decided to go over to Italy so she can meet the CEO in person... But will they she able to keep her business trip strictly professional? \u2666 I loved the easy banter between Lex and Masi. They loved provocing each other and pushing each other's limits and it was fun witnessing which one of the two would snap first. Since the story is written in alternating point of views, we find out that both characters were obviously attracted to each other but that they each have their own reasons for keeping their distance at first. That's why their was a lot of back and forth going on between the two of them before they finally gave in to the attraction. The sex scenes were hot, albeit them being a little over the top in a give-it-to-me-baby kind of way.<---F> Not that that ever bothered me</---F>. But there was one particular scene that had me going (<---B>view spoiler</---B>) [Balls. (hide spoiler) ] That's the only thing I'm going to say about it, and if you've read the book, you'll know what I mean, LOL. Other than that, I can honestly say that I really enjoyed this entertaining read. Based on the introductions of Lex's friends and fellow Manhanttanites, I'm already looking forward to reading their stories in the rest of the series! There was no cliffhanger . In fact there was even a very sweet, perhaps maybe a little too cheesy (for my liking), happy ending . As Lex would say, \"I came, I saw, I came again. I have things to do.\" And now I'm off to read the next part of The Manhattanites! xoxo. \u2666 CASTING: \u2666 3.5-4 STARS. **Copy courtesy of the author via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review** [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more Getting ready to re-read this almost exactly two years later!

This is an erotica , so of course there was some sex scenes (which were quite hot! ). But it wasn't overloaded with sex, just a lot of talk about sex and crude language. But it was also very funny , well to me anyways. To start with the story, Lex Easton is a fashion designer from New York. She is the owner of Easton's Essentials and has been buying her fabric from the Italian textile complany, Girasoli . Fashion week is fast approaching but she has yet to recieve her fabric order to create her samples for the line. When she calls to ask about her order, Prince Massimo Tuttoni, (whom she has had a crush on and named her B.O.B after.) responds the order will not be delivered... ever . Their business contract has been terminated. Outraged, Lex goes to Italy to confront him in person and to demand she get her fabric. Lex was quite a fiesty character. She definitely wasn't shy when it came to getting what she wants. But when it came to cameras and the spotlight , she would rather run and hide. She had a difficult upbringing with both parents being famous . She felt as though she was put under a microscope . So she stays away from the media. I liked her, she wasn't a whiney woman who couldn't make up her mind. She knows what she wants and goes out to get it. But sometimes she could be a bit stubborn when things didn't go her way, which I didn't really like. Then there is the one and only... the Italian hunk with the package the size of an \"evian water bottle\" , Prince Massimo Tittoni . He is the CEO of Girasoli Garment Company. He is arrogant and intense, known to be a playboy and eternal bachelor . Massi is what he was raised to be. He doesn't want to fall in love again after he was left devastated in the past. He wants to start his own fashion line using their textiles, so he is no longer selling it. But soon, he learns he may need Lex's expertise to pull it off. So he decides to propose a business agreement to her. I am so happy we got to see both of the characters pov . Because at first, I did not like him. But once you see the reasons why they were both fighting the attraction, it was really funny to see them push each other's boundaries. He was still a bit of a jerk at times, but also could be quite endearing in others. So eventually I did end up liking him. They just made a great duo. Okay, now moving on the sex .... what can I say. There were some scenes that were plenty hot ! But it was really over-the-top . I liked the threesome scene thrown in this book, but the only thing I didn't like was that the girl involved kept yelling \"darlings\" to her lovers. It kinda killed it for me and I couldn't help but giggle . There wasn't a buttload of sex in this book but the scenes that there were, were just too porno-ish to me. I mean honestly, they needed a freaking mop with all the squirting that was happening. I started to wonder if Lex didn't have some sort of water hose in there. And then there was a scene involving Massi's balls , all I could think was... is that possible?? I don't know if I was the only one thinking this, but I got so damn curious I had to google it to find out *don't judge me*... and it was !! I was like \"Lordy!!!\" And to those who have read it and know what I mean, I hope you don't think I'm stupid lol! So yeah, some pretty hot scenes. The whole story was a bit on the fast side, as in, Lex and Massi both fall in love quickly . I think because of the pace of the book, I had trouble really connecting with both characters. But it was still entertaining seeing both characters interact . The ending was bit too cheesy than what I would have liked. We'll see how the next book in this series turns out. If you are looking for a fun, light, sexy read, this is it.

I'm sure I would have had more background information about Lex's friends and family, but I don't feel like reading this book out of sequence took anything away from my enjoyment of this book. The heroine, Lex, has worked incredibly hard to reinvent herself after her famous rockstar father died, leaving Lex and her mother bankrupt, with only an inheritance of bad debt. After sinking what remains of her personal savings into rehabilitation centers to sober her mother up, she sets out to make something of herself. Through her sweat and tears, along with some financial help from a close friend, Lex is able to build her clothing line from the ground up. After a few years, Lex's company, Easton Essentials, is a mainstay in her corner of the fashion market. When her fabric supplier fails to deliver her order before thie season's big debut show, she knows that all of her hard work would be destroyed if she doesn't get that order filled. With the timeline growing ever nearer, she decides to fly to Italy to confront the arrogant business owner herself. Massimo is immediately taken aback by this brazen American beauty who's interrupted his vacation to demand that he fulfill her fabric order. He'd cancelled the order after Ms. Easton's company failed to pay for the order. While he feels sorry for this stunning woman, he cannot let his attraction to her cloud his judgment. He had plans to discontinue their business relationship in the near future anyway, as he had made the decision to take his business in a new direction. If everything went according to plans, he'd be marketing his own clothing line to compete with Easton Essentials. As I'm sure you can imagine, Lex and Massimo got off to a rocky start. From the beginning, their relationship was full of sexual tension and witty banter. These two loved to hate each other. There was never a dull moment as they verbally warred with each other and constantly tried to gain the upper hand. When they finally succumb to their passions, it was long over-due and scorching hot. However, the blissful new beginning doesn't last for long. Immediately the couple is thrown into a scandal of epic proportions. Lex is forced to leave Massimo while she attempts to do damage control and salvage her hard-earned reputation. For the most part, this story was a humorous, entertaining and sexy read. It was well-written and flowed well from one part to the next. I liked the characters and the storyline, but I never fell in love with them. It was a nice, sweet story, and a good choice for those days when you need to recover from a book hangover. It was straightforward and easy to read. Overall it was \"good\". ...more 4 Red Carpet Stars Lex is the only daughter of an old music legend who killed himself a few years ago and left her and her mother without anything.

But she is persistence and will fight for her dream\u2026 even if she has to go to Italy and try to convince the CEO herself. The CEO is no one less than Prince Massimo, the ultimate billionaire hot playboy that even belongs to the Italian royalty. And Massimo didn\u2019t expect the CEO of Easton to be so stubborn\u2026 in fact, he didn\u2019t even expected it would be a woman, and a hot one!! Both of them are slightly troubled by past and unable to commit\u2026 but when feelings starts to get messed up, things start to heat and well\u2026 you can say that their professional relationship will never be the same. This was way better than I was expecting it to be. (My expectations weren\u2019t very high, I confess.) There were basically two drastic speeds in this book: Extremely Hot and Extremely Funny. It was a very entertaining reading with good steam in the middle. I particularly liked the little explanation of the characters and the surroundings in the beginning of the book; it was a good change of pace.

And sometimes it went way outa my comfort zone, but still I enjoyed reading it because of the sassy witty way Masi and Lex had with each other.

Lex was intended to keep this trip strictly professional when she secretly desired for Masi and have every kind of ____ dream imaginable on planet earth! *you got the picture i guess* Soon the professional trip turned into something that both Lex and Masi wren't prepared for. Masi wanted her but he was afraid of what had happened in his past and wasn't ready for another heartbreak on the other hand Lex was ready to offer him Friends with Benefits proposition.

With all these components and ingredients, I enjoyed unwrapping to see what was inside. The author created a world built around fashion, with a sexy prince and a fashion designer who is the daughter of a rock star, and when both clash, their chemistry was sexy and enjoyable. Prince Massimo Tittoni of Milian, has everything a girl could dream of, including having a fabric empire he is building. Once he decides to stop supplying Lex Easton, of fabrics, she takes matters into her own hands and flies to Milian to convince Prince Massimo to redistribute the fabrics for her collection. I like everything about this couple. The way they met, their sexual attraction, their sexual sex-capades, the way Prince Massimo has everything but still has a guard up emotionally to protect himself and the way Lex was, as she didn't seem like the product of a rock star. The author definitely conveyed these two characters to me. One of my favorite scenes, the office negotiation of business percentages as Lex has a hand full of Prince Massimo's privates while dealing. There were so many more fun and exciting scenes that will arose the reader, depending on personal taste. Also, to let the reader be aware, there was a minute of f/m/m scene, which included other characters. I found the supporting characters to be interesting and definitely, and I do mean definitely....exciting with the added spice they brought to the story in a particular scene. Some parts of the story draws you in while other parts were just ok. There were a lot of Italian mix with English, which got sexy a few times, as well as a lot of name dropping of products. It got a bit annoying as I thought it was over done personally, but each reader is different. Also most of the story took place in Milian, so I am looking forward to see the next location of book 2. Overall, an interesting read mix with romance, fashion and sex. RNJ http://www.romancenoveljunkies.com/So... Pinterest http://pinterest.com/ladyravenrave/ro... ...more NOW THAT WAS A SCORCHER!!!!

The characters were all VERY well done and my favorite was Lex Easton the heroine. She was a go-getter, and tough and smart when she needed to be. The hero Massimo Tittoni was every woman's fantasy come to life. He is a prince, yep you read that right, a real prince and he was very charming to boot. Massimo is also handsome, very rich, owned palaces, expensive sports cars, airplanes, you name it, and he had it. He was also very well built, wasn\u2019t lacking in the male appendage department\u2026he was huge\u2026and he knew how to use it. *sigh* The heat level was OVER THE TOP HOT!! There was m/w/m scene that Lex watched from a hiding place that just about over heated my Kindle. WOW! The love scenes with Lex and Massimo were really hot and so well done that even my panties got wet\u2026did I just say that? I love my erotica, and the author did not disappoint. Towards the end of the book, Lex and Massimo parted ways. I found myself shedding a tear or two, it really got to me. I was not certain what was going to happen between these two lovers, and then to my surprise the romance kicked in high gear and I was left with an ear to ear smile on my face. The ending was conclusive, nicely done and it left me feeling good, but I still wished that there would have been an epilogue, I just love reading about how happy the couples are and what is going on with them a few years down the road. Oh well, maybe next time. Looks as if I found myself another FANTASTIC must read author! Avery Aster did a splendid job on this book and I can hardly believe that this is her debut novel.

The sexual tension is palpable and the passion is clear, but the cultural miscommunications lead to a debacle, the couple may not be able to fix. What I loved about Undressed: -Massimo sleeps with three Cane Corsos (big ass dogs) in his bed. -Lex built her fashion label from nothing, helping her mother along the way. -Lex is determined to be successful at any cost, which leads her to fly to Milan to deal with Massimo face to face. -The author knows her shit about the fashion world, from fabrics to designers. -Jemma. Massimo's employee and friend who helps Lex with all things Milanese. She's a great character. -There's some very hot sex that includes a main character as a voyeur. I get to add the shelf \"female ejaculation\". Woohoo! -I enjoyed the plot and the characters were very colorful. -The author made some unpredictable choices that surprised me in a good way. What I didn't like about Undressed: -I would have liked to see Massimo's temper a bit more. He was always very calm. -Where was all of Lex's fire when she should have been mad at Massimo? -There was something strange during one of the sex scenes that I just can't fathom. It took me out of the book. (view spoiler) [When the couple is having sex, he inserts his \"gigantic dick\" AND BALLS into her \"tight pussy\". I don't have balls, but that sounds like it would hurt. And I've read a lot of erotica, a lot . And I've never read balls inserted for penetration. As a nurse, I'm perplexed. (hide spoiler) ] -Some of the dirty talk, I found strange. Both the Italian and the New Yorker said, \"Come on\" and \"Let's Go\" quite often. That's ball game chatter, not dirty talk. I look forward to book 2. ...more Loved, loved, loved!!

The banter between the main characters, Lex, a fashion designer and Masi, a prince and CEO of a large Italian textile company, are fun to read and their romance was actually very sweet. Both are well developed and I was happy that the author did provide us with a believable back story of Lex and Masi. The ending was a bit cheesy for my taste but I think it worked out well. I will say that this book is not for everybody. If you're looking for something dark and has a lot of angst, this book isn't for you. This book is escapism in its purest form. So if you're looking to slip into another world where it's full glitz and full of fashionable and beautiful people, then you would really enjoy this book.

Let\u2019s start with Lex. She\u2019s by far my favorite character and I loved her and her snarky group of friends. She\u2019s made a name for herself in the fashion world, in spite of a difficult upbringing in the public eye, via her talent and straight up working her ass off. No hand outs for this girl. When something gets in the way of her professional dreams she confronts it head on, which is exactly how she meets Italian playboy and BOB namesake Massimo Tittoni. In addition to being a hot and wealthy tabloid fixture, Massimo also owns the textile company and the fabric Lex needs to make her designs a success. When, deadline looming, Lex\u2019s fabric is MIA she heads to Massimo\u2019s private island off the coast of Italy to rectify the situation. Some people have it so rough! Lex is hot, Massimo\u2019s hot and it\u2019s an Ellora\u2019s Cave novel. It\u2019s not difficult to see where the story\u2019s headed. In spite of that, sexy times between these two took a bit longer to get to than I\u2019d expected, in a good way. Lex and Massimo run through every conceivable emotion as far as the other\u2019s concerned, from anger to distrust to lust to hurt to love. And back again. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say this is a fast paced book. Lex and Massimo fall IN LOVE over the course of one week. During that week we\u2019re also gifted with a threesome witnessed by Lex, Milan nightlife, two devious skanks looking to make a quick buck, a tabloid scandal involving a previously under the radar Lex and family drama. Oh, lots of fashion action takes place as well. There\u2019s a lot packed into this story and that\u2019s probably my biggest complaint. As entertaining as it was, I felt the connection between Lex and Massimo suffered because of it and I didn\u2019t entirely buy the big finale HEA. In spite of some story issues I highly enjoyed Undressed . I\u2019m already looking forward to reading about Lex\u2019s friends (maybe?) as the series progresses.

There's a happy ending, there's lots of sexual content, but this story just didn't work for me. I did like the movement between New York, Milan, and so forth as well as a little look in to the fashion world. I like the way Aster attempted to paint the characters in three dimensions rather than one. I also just liked the fact that Massimo continuously weaved Italian into his talking language because I do love Italian.

There were so many pages that I loved in this book, but the sex unfortunately pulled me out of my enjoyment. I hope I can do my best to explain my point of view. Italian Prince Massimo Tittoni was hot. SUPER HAWT. He spoke with the most delicious accent and I loved how his dialogue was sprinkled with sexy Italian words. And Lex? She was funny as hell. Not just a little bit funny, but HUGELY funny. The emotion between them is palpable, clearly written and believable. I swooned in anticipation for their happily ever after. But I found that things didn\u2019t always add up and the sexual relationship between them wasn\u2019t strong enough in the end. Now this book is naughty. It isn\u2019t written with flowery words. It is all about tits and d*ck. And the sexual scenes are explicit. Yet the acts between Massimo and Lex are very few and far between. At times it felt like there was more sex between the side characters.I wanted more! For such an explicit book there wasn't enough sex between the protagonists. Massimo is also explained as being hung like an Evian bottle. And Lex hasn\u2019t had sex in a while. So add those together and I anticipated a slow, sensual \u2013 yet explicit scene for their first time. I was wrong...and left with the impression that Lex\u2019s vagina resemble a chasm of doom with everything she fit in there. I\u2019ve never read a scene where a guy shoves his monster truck sized penis into a woman AS WELL as the berries. That was an eye opener. And although the scene was described as \"making love\" it just felt like sex to me. There were other bits and pieces I didn\u2019t enjoy sexually speaking but I\u2019m not going to go into detail because they are my own sexual preferences. And no, I\u2019m not talking about the guy on guy scene \u2013 I loved that. BUT \u2013 apart from my aversion to the sex I did enjoy this book. I think Avery is a master of sarcastic humor. I loved her one-liners, Massimo, Lex, the writing style, the pace. The majority of the story was really great in my opinion and I am looking forward to the next in this series. Hotness Rating: This is actually a hard one to rate. Its explicit nature deserves a 5, but there just wasn't enough actual sex to rate it that high.

Set against the backdrop of the fashion industry. this witty, humorous and erotic romance is brilliantly written, with sparkling dialogue, it's a must read. The characters are well drawn and very believable. The sex scenes are really hot and passionate. I loved Lex and her no nonsense and bossy attitude, which acted as a perfect foil to Massimo's more traditional outlook. There were many laugh out loud moments as well. Plus there are a whole cast of supporting characters. The writing is flowing and descriptive, and unless I knew this was the authors first book, I would have assumed she was a seasoned professional. The content and language are explicit, just to warn those of you who are concerned.

She is desperate to complete her samples for her up and coming fashion collection, showcasing in a few weeks. Following a misunderstanding during the initial phone conversation, Lex decided to travel to Massimo\u2019s Isola di Girasoli, where he was on vacation. The dialogue was hysterical, including the constant internal musings. Lex had previously adoringly named her BOB \u201cMasi\u2019s salami\u201d, which was confirmed on sight when she sneakily admired his \u201cEvian bottle\u201d on entering the garden pool at his \u201cpalace\u201d! We are taken through their dancing interactions, with Italian subtext, fashionista name dropping and, above all, great humour. Needless to say the chemistry was off the scale..just how I like it! Be aware that our gorgeous Masi favours the \u201csee you next Tuesday\u201d word, and being British, I have to say consider yourself warned! I thoroughly enjoyed Avery\u2019s writing style, and the fashion background just increased my interest. Her old & new friends were intriguing characters, and I look forward to seeing how they may develop/feature in the upcoming series. ...more<---C>Avery Aster</---C>", "Title": "Undressed"},
