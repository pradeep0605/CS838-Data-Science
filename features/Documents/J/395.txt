My review is not worth reading. ----------------------------------- I'm such a drama queen. This is all planned out: I imagined a ceremonious return to goodreads, where I shock the masses with a derisive and scathing critique of one of my favorite authors, and the goodreads community would all be astir. \" What happened to him?\" \"Didn't he just love David Mitchell?\" \"He wouldn't shut up about him!\" And then the marauding hordes would rise out of the woodworks,<---M> tear me from my home</---M>, and tie me to the stake, set those sticks ablaze, crying, \"Traitor! Traitor! What hath the apostate said about the lord our Mitchell? Blasphemy!\" And I'd look fierce and proud, dying a martyr for the cause. What vanity! Who was it, David Foster Wallace, that said people don't think about you nearly as much as you think other people think about you? The interesting thing is that David Mitchell, in many ways, has already reviewed his own book. Turn your hymnals to page 291: \"In my salad days at Cambridge, I got into a fistfight defending the honor of Hershey's early masterpiece Desiccated Embryos and to this day I wear the scar on my ear as a badge of honor . . . To dub Echo Must Die 'Infantile, flatulent, ghastly drivel; would be an insult to infants, to flatulence, and to ghosts alike. . . So why is Echo Must Die such a decomposing hog? One: Hershey is so bent on avoiding clich\u00e9 that each sentence is as tortured as an American whistleblower. Two: The fantasy subplot clashes so violently with the book's State of the World pretensions, I cannot bear to look. Three: What Surer sign is there that the creative aquifers are dry that a writer creating a writer-character?\" I wouldn't go as far as that , but Mitchell's fictionalized critic has a point. Self-referential self-deprecation is so pass\u00e9, so 2004. What is this Cloud Atlas ? It's true, the fantasy plot in Bone Clocks is crammed into the other stories, and it is such a jarring shift in tone that it derails the novel; it threw me out of reality that Mitchell tries so hard to create. And it's mostly due to the fact that fantasy novels insist upon its own language, invented words, self-serious monologuing, and exposition-dumping, all of which is difficult enough to stomach in a strict fantasy novel, let alone a novel that wants to be every genre. (And that's not a bad thing in my book. It's what has made Mitchell the writer he is, but it's seems too difficult to throw fantasy into the genre juggling circle.) Furthermore, the fantasy \"sub-plot\" is actually the main plot in Bone Clocks . However, this plot is dropped for almost 50 pages at a time. The writing, while certainly lovely, feels aimless through most of the novel. We meander through large passages of beautiful prose that detail the lives of sad, sexually-frustrated males, only to find our way back to a strange and ham-fisted fantasy plot. And several times, Mitchell touches on the plot through some serendipitous event that demands explanation, which the characters (ignorant of the grander scheme behind it all) can not make sense of. It's all awash in semi-mystical, new age metaphysics, Murakami at his worst. When the plot lands and Mitchell does explain the mechanism behind the mysteries, we're a good 450 pages into the novel. There were such large stretches of text that persisted without explanation that I failed to find it interesting, important, or significant. Don't get me wrong, this is still D. Mitch, and the dude can turn a phrase like it's no one's business, but the structure does more to inhibit the novel's enjoyment that it does to enhance the writing. The book's far too uneven or consistent to have taken off, and maybe this is what is was like to not enjoy Cloud Atlas and that seems fair to me now. I'll just go reread Number9Dream and wax nostalgic about the good ole' days when I could worship unquestionably at the feet of my idols. Maybe then those damn kids will get off my lawn. ...more Dear James Wood, We read and love writers for very different reasons. I read Albert Camus and I read Jorge Luis Borges.

You cannot posit that one is superior to the other without falling into the trap of a certain form of elitism that we can surely do without today. \"<+++>The Bone Clocks</+++>\" is not only superb and entrancing storytelling but it does have plenty to say about the human condition. Suspension of disbelief does not annihilate meaning. I found this novel to be quite profound in parts, a love letter to family, an ode to imagination, a dire warning to humanity about the next fifty years. I was transported, engrossed and moved.

Six interconnected stories told in the first person, combined to create a novel, radiating like raindrop rings on water - or maybe the walls of a concentric maze leading to the elusive center - from a central overarching theme. You've seen it from David Mitchell not that long ago, in the hit-smash-success Cloud Atlas . You'll see it again in <+++>The Bone Clocks</+++> - but less gimmicky, more streamlined, a bit more cohesive, and a bit more playful. The overarching theme this time appears to be mortality (the titular 'bone clocks' are just us, people, mercilessly showing signs of passage of time on our faces and bodies) and power and the lengths we'll go to for this elusive goal. But the cornerstone holding the novel together is not as much this theme, really, but the life of one character whose viewpoint starts and ends the book. All the other elements aside, The Bone Clocks is really the story of <---C>Holly Sykes</---C> , glimpsed through the eyes of different characters over 60 or so years. Holly is the glue holding the six interconnected novellas and the expansive meandering narrative together, conducting six novellas into a quite chronological story of one person, albeit seen from a few different viewpoints and angles. Holly at 15, hurt by the first love; in her 20s in Switzerland, grazing a life of someone else like a bright meteor; in her 30s, with a child and a partner who seems to be married to his job; in her 40s, touching the life of a less-than-admirable pathetic creature of a writer; in her 50s in the middle of supposedly the most epic battle of all; and in her 70s, living in the post-technology post-apocalyptic Ireland. \u201cBeing born's a hell of a lottery.\u201d Running through Holly's life is a mystical thread of strange events, precognition and brushing from time to time with the Horologists and Anchorites - the two kinds of immortals engaged in their own perpetual tug of war. It seems to me that this unexpected genre blending with fantasy - or as our lit'rary colleagues will call it, 'speculative fiction' (yes, Margaret Atwood, I'm side-eying you) to avoid the label of the genre with which they remain uncomfortable - is what both puzzled and frazzled a few critics out there . Yours truly, however, being a proud old hand at all this genre/fantasy/sci-fi stuff, will scoff snobbishly and say - 'Puh-lease.' And yet, as much as it hurts this fantasy fan to admit it, the overt inclusion of fantastical elements is what weakened the story . In comparison with the other parts where just a slight teasing suggestion of 'magical realism' was perfect for infusing the atmosphere of the novel with just a right amount of uneasy suspenseful beauty, the overt trip to the realm of supernatural was not Mitchell's forte, leading to an almost young-adult level of sudden grating simplicity of rather non-ambiguous good-vs-evil psychic battle leading to an anvil-like foreshadowed magical maze. How fervently did I wish during the entire Marinus section that the merciless editorial scissors had chopped that chapter right out\u00b9, leaving us with a subtle undercurrent of mysterious 'other' instead. \u00b9 While we're on the editorial chopping block theme, I wish the merciless scissors or metaphorical red pen went through the overindulgent Crispin Hershey section a bit as well. One can only take so much 'meta' screaming, 'Look how clever I am! Lookie here! I'm a writer character so meta-ish-ly preempting all your reactions and all your reviews and how fracking wittily smart is it of me, huh?' Puh-lease. I get it. Enough. Cut it out. Move on. As far as Mitchell's strengths go, the powerful punch-in-the-gut impact is in the bits of Iraq war rather than in the supposedly decisive and overwrought Good-vs-Evil fantasy-overdone battle. What saves this novel from a nosedive, however, is Mitchell's good sense in stepping away from the supposed fantasy climax you've been expecting the book to end with, making the phantasmagorical brouhaha the less memorable, less important part. Because then, after the fireworks should all be over and the quiet wrap-down should have begun, Mitchell moves on instead to the sixth and final section of the book, the one that puts quite a bit of things we've seen so far into perspective and - of course - reminds us that the worst threat to us comes not from the warring Immortals but from our usual regular selves doing our regular usual things without stopping to think that once our short mortal lives are over someone else will be left to live the mess we made of it all. A random aside: I see much has been written about the interconnectedness of this work with other Mitchell's books as a number of characters have had cameos in his other novels. Clever, but hey - those of us Constant Readers who have followed Stephen King (the non-lit'rary genre guy, yeah?) are no strangers to the concept of the fictional universe interconnected by numerous characters traipsing in and out of seemingly separate novels. The language of the novel - well yes, I did enjoy it quite a bit. I like Mitchell's style, with his easy organic humor, unexpected apt metaphors, and quotable passages. It flows, 'nuff said. \u201cWe live on, as long as there are people to live on in.\u201d And so, The Bone Clocks . What do I actually think of this book, after all these words and thoughts that \"meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox\"? It's still hard to say. I loved the first three parts (Holly, Hugo, Ed), slogged through the overwrought meta-pathetic Crispin story, stumbled through Marinus' bit in exasperation at the nosedive the quality of the novel was taking, and despite all the dystopian clich\u00e9s was grateful at the direction the story took in the final Holly chapter. The inevitable highs and lows - cannot escape them. After all, despite my most fervent wishes, writers do not create all of their stories to appeal specifically to me. But the highs outweigh the lows, as I realize while finishing this review, and so 4 stars it will be. Even more - I'll finally crack open my copies of other Mitchell books, even if just to see what he does with the stories that don't come in six interconnected bits (there are some, right?) ...more For many, David Mitchell seems to be an untouchable.

I may have missed a few parts, due to skimming, but in the end, nothing offered closure of any kind.

It also includes a selection of favourite quotes and links to interviews. The difference in star rating is deliberate: I couldn't decide. LINKS AND THEMES This book, perhaps more than any of his others, cannot be viewed in isolation. In particular, it is closely tied to The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet ( https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... I\u2019ve read all Mitchell\u2019s previous books (four of them twice): connectedness is the most overarching theme, within and between books. All (except Black Swan Green?) muse on (im)mortality, specifically souls moving from one body to another, but not in a spooky paranormal way; it\u2019s more matter-of-fact than that. The sometimes uneasy host/guest/invader relationship is mirrored in wider themes about power, exploitation and survival of the fittest. Music often features, as do islands, rescue vessels (literal and metaphorical), and survival despite societal collapse. Here, there is no sudden, total apocalypse and it happens without a glittering high-tech future in between. Most famously, characters from one book make fleeting appearances in another. This is fun, pretentious , sometimes gratuitous, distracting, but enriching. I like the idea that just as his novels (including this) are often built up of connected stories in different styles, those novels have a similar relationship to each other: stories within stories within stories, creating a whole world of connections: immortality by transferring from one vessel to another. \u201c Each of my novels are expanders or chapters in a kind of uber-book, a piece of a universe that all my novels are making \u201d. That makes it less surprising that his next five novels are \u201cplanned to some degree\u201d. One will be the final volume of the Marinus trilogy. The Thousand Autumns had seemed to be a fairly conventional historical novel with fewer connections than Ghostwritten and Cloud Atlas; The Bone Clocks changes that, exposing overlaps and hidden fantasy: \u2022\tSlade House (reviewed here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... ) is entirely in this world. \u2022\tMarinus, a significant character in The Thousand Autumns, is a major character in this. \u2022\tMarinus mentions Arie Grote from his life in Dejima in Thousand Autumns. \u2022\tThe immortality-seeking baby-eating cult in Thousand Autumns is presumably an early grouping of Anchorites. \u2022\tWe glimpse Prescience, precursors of the Prescients from Cloud Atlas. \u2022\tHugo Lamb\u2019s cousin is Jason Taylor, the main character in Black Swan Green (who was in turn, heavily based on Mitchell). \u2022\tEd Brubeck writes for Spyglass magazine, as did Luisa Rey in Cloud Atlas. \u2022\tElijah D\u2019Arnoq is a reincarnation or descendant of a D\u2019Arnoq that Adam Ewing encounters in The Chatham Islands in Cloud Atlas. \u2022\tDwight Silverwind from Ghostwritten makes a small but significant appearance. \u2022\tMo Muntervary has small important roles here and in Ghostwritten. \u2022\tThere is a mention of a battle in a sunken garden, the title of the opera Mitchell recently wrote the libretto for. \u2022\tHolly\u2019s family get takeaways from The Thousand Autumns Restaurant (though it\u2019s Chinese, not Japanese). \u2022\tSoleil Moore: she\u2019s an Asian-American poet who is really important, then drops out of the narrative completely. I\u2019m guessing she\u2019ll feature prominently in a future book. There are also characters apparently based on real characters: Lord Roger Brittan is a minor character, rather like Lord (Alan) Sugar; more obviously, Crispin Hershey is remarkably like Martin Amis (see below). The book even references itself: Hershey bases one of his characters on Holly\u2019s husband, and Soleil Moore accuses him of having written about Anchorites. CAST There is an enormous cast, and some characters live in multiple bodies and so go by different names. Those peripheral in one section are often significant in later one. I don\u2019t need to like the protagonists of a book, which is just as well. Holly isn\u2019t un likeable, but I found her voice annoying and trying too hard to sound teenage, yet not always believable. (In particular, endless abbreviations: \u201cEd Brubeck\u2019ll be\u201d, \u201cMam will\u2019ve told Dad\u2026 \u2018bout why\u201d, and the apostrophe-esses that weren\u2019t possessive were easy to stumble over). Other characters are highly unpleasant, yet somehow lacking the glamour of a really good baddie. Many have accents in their names, which was a little distracting: Zoe, Anais, Eilish, Oshima, Immaculee \u2013 but not Aoife. Hershey, Amis, Mitchell? Critics have seen close parallels between Martin Amis and former \u201cWild Child of British Letters\u201d, Crispin Hershey: in terms of life events, writing style, personality, and book titles (Hershey\u2019s successful Desiccated Embryos and another called Red Monkey compared with Amis\u2019 Dead Babies and Yellow Dog). Martin's father, Kingsley, is even quoted, saying a bad review might spoil breakfast, but he wouldn\u2019t let it spoil lunch. Mitchell has repeatedly denied any conscious link. Instead, he claims Hershey is \u201cnot just my worst aspect, he\u2019s my fears. He\u2019s what I might turn into if I\u2019m not careful\u201d and he \"is all the worst parts of me, amplified and smooshed together\" and in this section \"I got to have a lot of fun spoofing people like me\". Hershey\u2019s most successful novel has a symmetrical structure, like Cloud Atlas. Most literary critics are sceptical. The Guardian wondered whether \u201cburied deep within this scrupulously polite and unassuming writer, a revenge fantasist [is] just waiting to punish the reviewers who dismiss him\u201d or if he\u2019d \u201cbelatedly woken up to the fact that taking a pop at his literary elders is not necessarily the smartest career move\u201d. I\u2019ve only read one Amis novel, and nothing else by him; I wonder if he has Crispin\u2019s quirk of alternating between first and third person for himself \u2013 even in a single sentence! META \u2013 MUSINGS ON WRITING Mitchell sees each collection of related novellas as part of a greater work: echoes and foreshadowing abound, Hershey\u2019s failed book has \u201cEcho\u201d in the title, and elsewhere, we\u2019re told the mysterious \u201cScript\u201d \u201cloves to foreshadow\u201d. In this, he explicitly muses on fiction, writing, and lit crit, and pre-empts some potential criticisms of this book. The bad review that kill Hershey's sales, includes, \u201cHershey is so bent on avoiding clich\u00e9 that each sentence is as tortured as an American whistleblower\u2026 The fantasy sub-plot clashes so violently with the book\u2019s State of the World pretentions, I cannot bear to look\u2026 What surer sign is there that the creative aquifers are dry than a writer creating a writer-character?\u201d Later, \u201cA book can\u2019t be a half fantasy any more than a woman can be half pregnant.\u201d After the second deus ex machina moment, Mitchell has one of the characters declare it as such, just so you know he knows. In some ways, Hershey is very unlike Mitchell, observing that \u201cin publishing, it\u2019s easier to change your body than it is to switch genre\u201d \u2013 something Mitchell makes a speciality of. He also makes prescriptive judgements on writing that I doubt Mitchell subscribes to in blanket terms: \u201cDouble-negatives are truth smugglers\u201d and \u201cAdverbs are cholesterol in the veins of prose\u201d. \u201cA writer flirts with schizophrenia, nurtures synaesthesia and embraces obsessive-compulsive disorder. Your art feeds on you, your soul and, yes, to a degree, your sanity. Writing novels worth reading will bugger up your mind, jeopardise your relationships and distend your life.\u201d At one point, Hugo observes, \u201csuch narrative arcs make great movies, but shitty lives\u201d; he neglects to say what sort of books they make. PLOT This is deceptively straightforward for Mitchell: a chronological story of one woman\u2019s life, told in six, first-person parts: 1984 \u201cA Hot Spell\u201d Illustrated with a disintegrating clock, narrated by Holly, a fifteen-year old who heard voices as a child, and now runs away after bust ups with parents and boyfriend. It is not Orwellian. (view spoiler) [From aged 7, Holly occasionally heard voices she called \u201cThe Radio People\u201d \u2013 \u201cnot a ghost\u2026 but a visitor to your mind\u201d. One night, one of them (Miss Constantin) appeared in her room, and afterwards, a bully Holly mentioned is hit by a van! Shortly after that, a psychiatrist (Dr Marinus) gets rid of the voices. Now, aged 15, after a row with her parents, she runs away to be with her boyfriend. Just before she goes, her brilliant but weird younger brother, Jacko, gives her a labyrinth he\u2019s drawn and stresses the importance of her memorising it. She finds boyfriend Vinny in bed with best friend Stella, so heads off on her own. She meets a strange old woman who knows her name and says she may ask for asylum. She thinks she glimpses Jacko in an underpass, but it can\u2019t possibly be him and then it turns into a more muddled multi-sensory hallucination. Later, she\u2019s staying with a couple who are suddenly dead, apparently by the power (or maybe just poison) of a strange and sinister visitor who rambles about all sorts of stuff neither she nor the reader understand. There is a bizarre, rather filmic fight, but she escapes and has her memory of it wiped. How is she narrating what was wiped? And a few pages later, she muses, \u201cWhen you know your memory\u2019s been monkeyed around with once, how can you ever be sure of any memory again?\u201d. She heads for a fruit farm and dreams she is pregnant (we later discover she was, and had an abortion). Ed Brubeck turns up and tells her Jacko is missing.

(view spoiler) [Hugo loves music (shades of Alex in Clockwork Orange, for more reasons than that: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... ), and in a crucial scene, he\u2019s approached by beautiful Immacule Constantin, who asks him about power.

Her reply includes \u201c Power is lost or won, never created or destroyed\u2026 Power is crack cocaine for your ego and battery acid for your soul\u2026 Power\u2019s comings and goings from host to host\u2026 are the plot of history\u2026 Power itself is amoral\u2026 Power is watching you. \u201d She offers him \u201cperpetual deferral of death\u201d, but doesn\u2019t explain, and next thing he knows, it\u2019s an hour later and she\u2019s gone.

(view spoiler) [See notes about Amis, and Meta, above. Hershey was the \u201cWild Child of British Letters\u201d, having had a very successful book (Desiccated Embryos) but a later one (Echo Must Die ) savagely reviewed by a uni friend of Hugo\u2019s called Richard Cheeseman. Hershey blames Cheeseman for ruining his career. He takes revenge. The repercussions are far worse than expected, but he\u2019s not overburdened with guilt, seeing Cheeseman as a thief, he \u201ccommitted the action. I am the reaction.\u201d Meanwhile, widowed Holly has written a bestselling memoir called \u201cThe Radio People\u201d, and they keep running into each other at book festivals around the world. He hates all the psychobabble, but, they form a friendship. Although Holly no longer hears The Radio People, she does get occasional premonitions, \u201cI\u2019d be mugged by a bunch of facts that hadn\u2019t happened yet\u201d and she has a specific recurring vision related to him, of \u201ca spider, a spiral and a one-eyed man\u201d. All three feature, loosely, in his sudden death at the hands of Soleil Moore, who thinks that killing him is the only way to make the world read her poems (that he had not) and so learn about the Anchorites. (hide spoiler) ] 2025 \u201cAn Horologist\u2019s Labyrinth\u201d Illustrated with an apple, narrated by Marinus. It becomes full-on YA fantasy here. It reminded me of Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials. If I\u2019d read any Dan Brown, I might spot parallels there. Plotwise, it could have ended at the end of this, but my rating would have been lower, as I found this section increasingly silly. (view spoiler) [This is where the bulk of the strange vocab occurs (see below). There is much backstory of Marinus (in his 36th body), and especially the long-standing war between Horologists (good) and Anchorites (bad). Repeated lives, coupled with premonitions is almost like time travel (people sending messages to their future selves via complex routes, for instance), people swap body/sex//country/name, and there\u2019s plenty of crossing and double-crossing. Anchorites are predators: they kill engifted children at regular intervals to maintain immortality and after that, they don\u2019t age and can... teleport! \u201cThey are addicts and their drug is artificial longevity.\u201d Horologists are \u201cborn\u201d as such, and when one body dies, they pass harmlessly to another random body, sometimes sharing a body with another soul. The Horologists have a complicated plan to destroy the Anchorites (a previous one failed): multiple body swaps, life and death, fighting, transporting, borderline magic\u2026 exciting, or just silly? It was the latter for me: the incantations sounded like Harry Potter spells, someone is bludgeoned with a rolling pin, and the writing goes crazy, \u201chidden by a Deep Stream cloak\u2026 got to you with a quantum totem\u201d and \u201ca crack in the fabric of the Chapel of the Dusk\u201d \u2013 bring me Lyra\u2019s Subtle Knife and be done! Anchorites see things rather differently: \u201cHorology is a club for immortals who prevent others from attaining their own privileges\u201d, which conveniently overlooks all the killing. The end of this chapter was a foregone conclusion for me, albeit not in the details, with a deus ex machina . (hide spoiler) ] 2048 \u201cSheep\u2019s Head\u201d Illustrated with a running fox silhouetted against an ominously large moon, told by Holly, who is old, and struggling to raise two children, as a slow-burn apocalypse approaches. There is irony the fact this increasingly desperate situation is utterly plausible and grounded in current and possible events. The fantasy battles of the previous chapter seems irrelevant \u2013 especially as connectedness is the most fundamental thing to collapse (\u201cthe commodity we\u2019re most in need of is news\u201d). (view spoiler) [Holly has survived cancer, but is old, living in rural Ireland, raising Aoife\u2019s daughter and a young boy refugee. It is The Endarkment: global power shortages, barely any internet, rising sea levels, food (and everything else) is rationed, a nuclear power station is leaking, gangs roam, and the Chinese dominate the economy (mail order brides now go from Europe to the East) and have concession in Ireland. The prognosis is decline, \u201cFor most of my life, the world shrank and technology progressed\u201d but she now realises that \u201c\u2019the natural order of things\u2019 is entirely man-made.\u201d She lives in an area protected by government forces, but is all too aware that as life gets harder, that may not be sustainable: \u201cCivilization\u2019s like the economy\u2026 if people stop believing it\u2019s real, it dies\u201d. Painfully real, basic survival is in sharp contrast to the preceding section. There\u2019s another deus ex - and this time the characters themselves recognise it as such (another pre-emptive strike by Mitchell). In its defence, it does tie up with Cloud Atlas. (hide spoiler) ] VOCAB The vocab list for anyone interested in horology became somewhat ludicrous. Here\u2019s a sample: Scansion, Incorporeals, Atemporals, Sojourners (go straight from one body to another, usually of the same sex), Returnee (\u201ceach resurrection is a lottery of longitudes, latitudes and demography\u201d, usually alternating gender, with a 49 day gap), subtalk, the Script, Aperture, Shaded Way, psychovoltaic, \u201chiatus freezes [someone], suasion forces [them]\u201d, oubliette, psychosoterica, carnivorous psycho-decanter, animacides, soul thieves, chakra-latent, dreamseed, metalife, transversing. CLOSING THOUGHTS \u201c For one voyage to begin, another voyage must come to an end, sort of .\u201d I think that sums up Mitchell\u2019s approach to his novels. Mitchell quotes mostly from http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/p... ), and http://www.theguardian.com/books/book... . Also interviews on BBC Radio 2\u2019s Book Club, and Radio 4\u2019s Front Row (that I can\u2019t find online any more). All my Mitchell reviews are on this uber shelf: https://www.goodreads.com/review/list... ...more The Confused and the Bewitched [Apologies to Dean Wareham] The bone clocks Sit clutching Champagne and Barbecue, Divided Betwixt the Confused and The bewitched. \"Being For The Benefit Of Holly Sykes!\" [Apologies to the Beatles] For the benefit Of Holly Sykes, There will be A show tonight With clowns On bikes And acrobats On trampolines.

If you don\u2019t like The daring scenes, Call for The author To be sacked. You\u2019ll get your Money back. It\u2019s just a circus act! \"Jacob's Ladder\" by William Blake Dwelling on a Reservation David Mitchell seems to have become a literary target, because he walks a fine line between Post-Modernism and commercial success. For the Post-Modernists, he's too popular to be holy. For the populists, he dabbles with genres without wholly embracing them. The dual attack makes you feel as if you must approach him with some reservation, with your guard up, that if you enjoy his fiction, if you derive pleasure from it, then you must do so uncritically or you might have missed some glaring stylistic flaws. Still, when I started reading \"The Bone Clocks\", I got swept away again. For the duration, I..yes...I suspended disbelief. So, teacher, does Mitchell deserve disbelief? Or suspension? The Book He Wrote Over the time I've been reading Mitchell, I've had some (mis-)apprehensions that I've had to work my way through each book. Recently, his style has been described as bad or atrocious. Is it really that bad? Is this exaggeration? Does he really deserve the forensic dissection and dismissal he gets at the hands of some critics? No writer is beyond critical judgement. However, not every author sets out to write \"War and Peace\". Mitchell is living proof that we tend to read the book we want to, not necessarily the book the author wrote. What is the point of criticising what a novel is not, or doesn't purport to be? Surely, most half-way competent authors wrote the novel they wanted to write? Maybe we should cut them some slack? Should we just ask, how successful were they in writing the novel they set out to write? This doesn't mean that we can't criticise what they did or didn't try to do. However, this can really only occur within the realm of overt subjectivity on the part of both author and reader. OK, maybe I didn't like what the author wrote. On the other hand, I have to appreciate that the author didn't write it so that I in particular might like it. They wrote it mainly so that they, the author, would like it. Genre Wreak I don't think Mitchell set out to write a self-consciously literary novel on this occasion. He just wrote the kind of novel he felt his subject matter demanded. In order to do so, he embraced genre. Again, I don't think he set out to become the next genre master, a Stephen King or Neil Gaiman. Mitchell plays around both with and within the boundaries of genre, not always by way of parody. But equally he doesn't take on strict accountability to the rules of genre (such as John Banville when he writes in the guise of Benjamin Black). He co-opts genre for his own purposes, for the purposes of his play and our entertainment. Genre is no more than a coathanger or skeleton upon which he drapes the threads or body of his narrative. My Wild Irish Prose Style Is Mitchell's prose particularly pretentious or purple? Not really. Like the character Crispin Hershey, he says he isn\u2019t \"a fan of flowery prose.\" It\u2019s neither overwrought nor underwrought. If anything, it's deliciously wrought-ironical. It\u2019s relaxed, casual, conversational, fluid, breezy, exuberant, charming, almost flirtatious. The sort of prose you'd hope to meet at a party, in fact, the very reason we used to go to parties. The Importance of Not Being Earnest I fear more that Mitchell might become too humorless, too serious, too self-consciously Post-Modernist, too precious, too everything I write is IMPORTANT, in other words, too Bill Vollmann, of all people. I fear that one day a Mitchell book will be just too, too nice, too complacent, too middle class, too metrosexual, or if it were a little more earnest, maybe too Jonathan Franzen. Luckily, this book isn't the one I fear. I hope he never writes it, or I never get to read it. Improvisational Techniquity I had another apprehension about style. Like Murakami, Mitchell goes where his characters' stories take him. He embraces improvisation. I kept looking for evidence that the result was sloppy or undisciplined. If his writing was ever rough-edged during the early drafts, then he or someone else has smoothed it over by the time I got to read it. Juxtaposition I'm Taking for Granted Well, maybe one last apprehension: that Mitchell's juxtaposition of disparate elements would be too arbitrary, too artificial, too unbelievable. Unlike \"Cloud Atlas\" , the writing style is consistent throughout the entire novel. The style doesn't change with the subject matter or the period. This allows the reader to focus on the characters and the narrative without obstruction. \"The Bone Clocks\" follows the life of Holly Sykes over sixty years, often through the eyes of her peers. Here, the six chapters are more obviously interrelated than those in \"Cloud Atlas\". They\u2019re very tightly intertwined, like strands of rope. The chapters segue far more smoothly. It's worth re-reading just to see how quickly and efficiently he achieves each segue. Suddenly you're on the other side of the looking glass. They\u2019re like snakes and ladders, or slippery slides. The transition is as easy as falling down a rabbit hole (Lewis Carroll) or an echoey stairwell (Murakami). Is This Just Fantasy? The main concern of many other readers seems to be the juxtaposition of fantasy elements (common to at least three of Mitchell's previous novels) with the apparent realism of some of his writing (in particular the first chapter in which we meet Holly Sykes). Some readers can\u2019t get their head around the \"fantasy-pedalling.\" Mitchell anticipates the objection, when a character pitches his next novel: \"A jetlagged businessman has the mother of all breakdowns in a labyrinthine hotel in Shanghai, encounters a minister, a CEO, a cleaner, a psychic woman who hears voices...think Solaris meets Noam Chomsky via Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Add a dash of Twin Peaks...\" \"Are you trying to tell me that you're writing a fantasy novel?\" \"Me? Never! Or it's only one-third fantasy. Half, at most.\" \"A book can't be half-fantasy any more than a woman can be half pregnant.\" Still, what is wrong with fantasy that Mitchell is criticised for embracing it? What's wrong with fantasy-pedalling or genre-hopping? China Mi\u00e9ville often cops the same criticism. Does the criticism say more about the reader than the author? Deliberately or not, Mitchell's works seem to divide readers between the confused and the bewitched. Caught in a Landslide, No Escape from Reality While Mitchell has demonstrated that he can write in the style of realism if he chooses to (particularly in some chapters of \"Cloud Atlas\" and \"Black Swan Green\" ), I don't think it's his preferred or most natural style. This doesn't mean that fantasy is either. His concerns are always too metaphysical or metafictional (i.e., Post-Modernist). He writes in whatever style he feels he needs. His style is as fluid as his requirements. The first-time reader shouldn't be surprised if the trappings of another genre suddenly appear in the narrative. They are almost inevitable. Here, though, it is strategically plotted, planned and foreshadowed (\"the Script loves foreshadow\"). Whatever your reaction on first reading, in retrospect it makes much more sense. Sometimes this only becomes apparent on a second reading. It won't be apparent if you grow impatient after the first 50 or 100 pages and skim the rest, oblivious to the detail or pleasures of the text. STOP MAKING SENSE! OK, that\u2019s enough serious talking head stuff. This book is loads of FUN! It\u2019s an adventure story. Lots of goofy, crazy, trippy, weird shit goes down. \"It\u2019s mad! Infeckinsane!\" It's \"totes amazeball.\" Mitchell must have been doolally when he wrote it. One of the characters wears a T-shirt with the slogan, \"Reality is an illusion caused by a lack of alcohol.\" (So is realism.) It's that kind of book. Don\u2019t, whatever you do, take it too seriously. Take it seriously, but only as much as you would a playful entertainment like the film \"Pirates of the Caribbean.\" It\u2019s like Indiana Jones meets \"Alice in Wonderland\" meets Umberto Eco (\"Foucault\u2019s Pendulum\") meets \"1Q84\" meets \"The Da Vinci Code\" meets Gabriel Garcia Marquez meets the Three Stooges meets \"The Wizard of Oz\" meets Voldemort meets Darth Vader meets Merlin meets Jules Verne meets \"Jack in the Beanstalk\" meets Biggles meets \"Little Red Riding Hood\" meets Enid Blyton meets \"The Matrix\" meets the Wachowski Siblings (just in time for the filmisation). It's like looking into Mitchell's mind and seeing everything he's ever watched or read, and enjoyed. It's like inspecting the last century through a kaleidoscope. This is the full David Mitchell Experience! The uncut Regurgitator! The complete acme David Mitchell Ruse Explosion! It's like...yes...Doctor Who! \"A Satirical, Postmodern, Science Fiction-influenced Adventure Story\" It\u2019s also like \"The Illminatus! Trilogy\", which wiki describes as \"a satirical, postmodern, science fiction-influenced adventure story.\" (Yes, it\u2019s been done before! Although this time it's more fantasy than science fiction.) I first encountered the term \"Post-Modern\" when friends who were architects introduced me to Charles Jencks\u2019 book, The language of post-modern architecture . I didn\u2019t see Post-Modernism as a threat to Modernism, so much as an embrace of playful eclecticism. There are ample architectural comments throughout the novel. One of my favourites goes like this: \"The BritFone Pavilion was designed by an eminent architect I've never heard of and 'quotes' Hadrian's Wall, the Tower of London, a Tudor manor, post-war public housing, Wembley Stadium and a Docklands skyscraper. What a sicked-up fry-up it is.\" Yes, that\u2019ll do, this novel is a sicked-up fry-up. It\u2019s a potpourri, a strange brew, an Irish stew, cooked up in le croc pot. One of my favourite characters would have wanted it named after him, \"Marinus Stew\", in honour of Gilbert Sorrentino\u2019s \"Mulligan Stew\", described in one of my favourite GR reviews as \"wonderful, and entertaining, and it might be the funniest book I\u2019ve ever read, and it is totally weird, and a masterpiece.\" Yes! The novel is also chock-full of allusions to other writers: Martin Amis, Kingsley Amis, Christopher Hitchens, Gilbert Adair, Lucretius, Ovid, W. H. Auden, Halld\u00f3r Laxness (who dat, I ask?), Michael Moorcock, Philip Roth, Tanizaki, E.M. Forster, Ursula Le Guin, Murakami, Samuel Beckett, Angela Carter, H. G. Wells, Dante, Wordsworth. There's a lot about writers and writing. Some good, some bad. How can you tell the difference between a master stylist and a wild child? Who cares! Post-Modernism can be FUN! It\u2019s a divine comedy. Have faith! Abandon doubt all ye who enter here! Believe it! The Great Illuminati Brawl What can you say about the plot? Somebody else can pr\u00e9cis it. Or you could read the book! OK, here's a bit of a snapshot. Good fights it out with Evil. This is one unholy sick crew. Or two. It\u2019s a battle between supernatural action heroes called the Horologists and the Anchorites. What? A trope? How dare Mitchell! It\u2019s the 21st century. Can\u2019t he come up with something new? What are they fighting about? I don\u2019t know. What do supernatural heroes normally fight about? Eternal life? Jacob\u2019s Ladder? A stairway to Heaven? The right to get to Heaven first? The exclusive right to get to Heaven? Whatever, they\u2019re pretty evenly matched, mirror images of each other, reversals, looking at each other through the looking glass. This is Your Last Chance (to be by, of and in the Script) Of course, the brawl is tightly scripted. In fact, it\u2019s all in the Script. And just to introduce some narrative tension, there\u2019s a Counterscript. And a metafictional or metafictitious guidebook that attempts to throw more (sun-) light on the Script (written by [Cirque du] Soleil Moore, aka the allusive Esmiss Esmoore). (view spoiler) [Off course;; Esmoore == Steven Moore, the greatest author of wicked excellent perfect awesome literary guidebooks evah!!! Word, bro!!! (hide spoiler) ] You could be forgiven for thinking that David Mitchell had written all three works of metafiction. Some conjuring trick! No need to split the royalties. It\u2019s a black comedy, perhaps even a black magic comedy. It\u2019s a prank, a funfair, a carnival, a circus. There\u2019s even a maze and a labyrinth. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s playful. It's Rabelaisian. As has been said on GR before: \"A work of art needs no other justification to exist than the sheer joy of the human imagination at play.\" There's a Feeling I Get When I Look to the West There\u2019s some serious stuff, of course. It involves the Eastern perspective on the West. Some of it is spiritual (mainly Buddhist), some economic, some political, some cultural. Traditionally, Mitchell has been very pro-East. However, as the world globalises, he seems to have become more equivocal (at least in relation to economic and political power). It doesn\u2019t matter what complexion power has: \"Shanghai's aura is the colour of money and power. Its emails can shut down factories in Detroit, denude Australia of its iron ore, strip Zimbabwe of its rhino horn, pump the Dow Jones full of either steroids or financial sewage.\" In a Tree by the Brook, There's a Songbird Who Sings And there\u2019s some stuff about love. There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold...Holly Sykes. Like us, she's a mortal human temporal, a bone clock. She falls in love several times. She has a daughter and a grand-daughter. But for a moment, she is a Woman in the Dunes, looking out to the Dusk as it approaches. Mitchell\u2019s story surrounds and cocoons her. It transports her through life and this adventure and this tale. At the end, she can\u2019t quite bring herself to say goodbye, nor can the author, nor can I: \"I'm feeling erased myself, fading away into an invisible woman. For one voyage to begin, another voyage must come to an end, sort of.\" After all the high jinks, there is an acceptance of mortality, not with resignation, but with grace. Life is what we do on Earth. If it exists, Heaven can wait. Memories can't wait, nor can fiction. Still, whether or not this voyage has ended, I\u2019m certain another one will soon begin. Sort of.

Like Cloud Atlas , his newest effort harnesses various genres of fiction into a larger mosaic work that highlights the interconnectivity of humanity and the versatility of fiction writing. Bone Clocks both builds upon and simultaneously suffers from its attempt at harnessing the popular fiction of the day, yet misses the mark in terms of both parody and creating a work of lasting value. The book is a enjoyable, wild ride, and it is no surprise it has a popular following and managed to poke about on bestseller lists for a brief period. However, in the cannon of David Mitchell, this book falls far short of its potential. Mitchell seems to be making a grab for a wider, younger reader base here with Bone Clocks , yet also appears to be self-conscious of this grab and satirizes the genres he parodies in order to wash his hands of the whole affair. Despite the length and sprawling settings, the book finishes feeling overly simplified and overly explained, nothing left for the reader to venture in their own minds, and, most unfortunately, feels as if the novel was cheated by being tied together by the tawdry fantasy elements. However, Mitchell does succeed in highlighting the elements of popular fiction and adapting his own prose to fit these elements. While Bone Clocks has a lot of positives going for it, it succumbs to the overpowering negatives amalgamated from lackluster\u2014and totally unnessesary\u2014fantasy sub-plots, weak dialogue, and an insistence at saturating the text with witty one-liners. A fascinating and engaging aspect of Cloud Atlas , to which this novel is sure to be frequently compared, was Mitchell\u2019s ability to sashay between genres and voice, creating a wide-ranging assortment of characters reincarnated through time as a brilliant metaphor for the reoccurrence of motifs in various literary traditions as well as an exploration of the how language evolves through time. Whereas Cloud Atlas parodied a wide range of notable styles across a lengthy timeline, using voices reminiscent of Herman Melville, Aldous Huxley, and even dipped into mass market action adventure crime dramas, Bone Clocks keeps the voices very contemporary. While this is in keeping with the shorter timeline of the novel, the variations are less noticeable and though it would seem impressive from a different author, it leads the reader to wonder why he would pull the same trick but to a lesser extent and the diminishing returns take the headspace that would otherwise be occupied by awe (this same aspect thwarts his character Crispin Hershey, though more on that later). Another dilemma is that the voices aren\u2019t all that varied in cadence and each voice is oversaturated with jokey one-liners and insults that are all built on the same blueprints. Mitchell compensates for this as most of his narrators are writers themselves, but the technique quickly becomes threadbare. There is no attempt to step into a voice outside the actual author\u2014Mitchell\u2014and each new narrator brings further diminishing returns of enjoyment and awe. Also, the collection of parodies seems more an ugly hodgepodge than a fine-tuned machine of separate gears working together. \u2018 think Solaris meets Noam Chomsky via The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo . Add a dash of Twin Peaks ... \u2019 Hershey\u2019s own future book sounds just as clumsy as the one at hand. The contemporary voice of the work seem pivotal to Mitchell\u2019s intent for the novel. Literature is an ever-changing, fluid beast that reacts both to the society and times from which it is created, but also to itself. Literature spawns from a tradition that is forever reshaped, reexamined and refurbished, drawing on both past and present to create something new and, hopefully, something noteworthy, but it cannot do so without recognizing where it has come from in order to step in a bold new direction. \u2018 Even if a poet sets out to invent a new poetics, \u2019 lectures character-author Crispin Hershey, \u2018 he or she can oly react against what\u2019s already there. There\u2019s no Johnny Rotten without the Bee Gees. \u2019 We live in an age of hyper-information, an age where anyone can voice an opinion and have it read across the globe, an age of \u2018entertainment and technology and every four year old with a computer, everybody his own artist\u2019 (William Gaddis, Agap\u0113 Agape ). In this age, literature has fallen prey to a capitalist agenda, where the books that are easily accessible\u2014in regards to both accesiblitliy to a consumer and accessibility of understanding\u2014are the ones that will be pushed and promoted on the market. These books are much like what social theorists spoke of about popular television a few decades ago, being something with the highest possible pleasure and leaving the recipient feeling as if they have not wasted their time though they have actually just been a passive viewer to what has transpired. With Bone Clocks Mitchell seems to to highlighting the characteristics of what is now considered popular fiction. Cloud Atlas had the merits of being a sort of \u2018literary pulp\u2019, being both pulpy stories but with a literary intent that would lead readers excited by the adventures towards the literary pillars Mitchell had parodied. Bone Clocks is similar, except he leads readers towards popular fiction, for better of for worse. Mitchell often mentions the authors and genres he satirizes by name, such as the name-drop of Lee Child in the action story narrated by Marinus. This story is particularly pockmarked with atrocious dialogue. Characters are overly jokey in high-stress situations\u2014a common occurrence in bad action films or books to point out how \u2018hardened\u2019 they are, and, in one unforgivable moment, the villain (yes, this book falls victim to the juvenile usage of a pure-evil villain character) of the book shouts \u2018 crush them like ants \u2019 during a battle sequence. People do not talk like this. Why would she need to inform her pure-evil team in the middle of a fight to the death that they should be trying to kill their opponents? Why reiterate that for the reader, unless it is assumed we\u2019ve missed the point that they should be killing each other. Once again, this is the characteristics of pulpy action stories. While other chapters seem based on writings of a bit more merit, such as the Martin Amis inspired Crispin Hershey or the war correspondent section, the characteristics of popular teen fiction seem to flicker in much of the novel. There are the tidy endings often found in that genre (in John Green\u2019s The Fault in Our Stars , a current corner-stone of popular fiction, the focal characters reject novels that do not have tidy, redemptive endings), and the cliche villain characters like Hugo that are charismatic, selfish and essentially sociopathic (a bit of a Voldemort character). An aspect that registered most distasteful are the \u2018allusions\u2019 that are more a mere name-dropping than actual references. Instead of cloaking an allusion to be unearthed by those who either know the material or do their research, Mitchell simply states things to rile up the fans. Daleks and the Tardis are simply called out, a technique found in popular fiction to excite fans but more borders on pandering than anything, and even the more literary references like the Auden and Laxness discussions are laid bare instead of assessed intertextually. I must admit to feeling the \u2018fan-boy\u2019 glee at name-drops such as Bonnie Prince Billy , but the frequent name dropping feels careless and desperate for attention rather than used for any higher purpose beyond elevating the readers pulse. The troublesome narration, flat dialogue, and pulpy, fantasy plots would be easily disposed as simply bad writing in any other author, but those familiar with Mitchell are sure to notice that the writing is uncharacteristically poor for an author who is known to take careful, self-conscious consideration and typically writes at a higher caliber than much of what is found within Bone Clocks . Perhaps the negative reception to the film version of Cloud Atlas , which is sure to have hurt sales (I personally used to recommend the book to customers at my bookstore, and was often met with a wrinkling of the face and comments on how they had heard or thought the movie was terrible). Perhaps Mitchell is attempting to expand his reader base and is dipping into popular fiction as bait. Many times while reading Bone Clocks I was upset knowing Mitchell is better than how he was carrying on. There is much evidence in the text to support he was aware of his attempt to parody popular fiction and his usually charming self-conscious anxiety assesses this frequently throughout the Crispin Hershey segment. Hershey\u2019s in-novel literary history reflects Mitchell\u2019s own in many ways. The five year gap between Bone Clocks and Thousand Autumns is represented in the five years before Hershey\u2019s Echo Must Die saw publication in the novel, and Hershey is always short-listed for, but never the recipient of, the most presigious European literary prize, mirroring the Man Booker Prize for which Mitchell is always notable but never victor. The most charming aspects of a David Mitchell novel is always when he exposes the clockwork, and Crispin Hershey\u2019s segment is that moment in this novel. Mitchell pokes fun at himself, such as the review of Hershey\u2019s Echo Must Die by character Richard Cheeseman (fans of Cloud Atlas are sure to enjoy that Cheesman\u2014Mitchell never missing an opportunity to ridicule reviewers by naming his reviewer Dick Cheese\u2014was first employed by a certain Felix Finch) stating: Why is Echo Must Die such a decomposing hog? One: Hersey is so bent on avoiding cliche that each sentence is as tortured as an American whistleblower. Two: The fantasy sub-plot clashes so violently with the book\u2019s State of the World pretensions, I cannot bear to look. Three: What surer sign is there that the creative aquifers are dry than a writer creating a writer-character? Each of these points are clearly addressing Bone Clocks itself, or is it that Echo Must Die is in fact a in-novel version of Bone Clocks? There are plenty of strong points in this novel, particularly Mitchell\u2019s recurring theme of those in power holding an obdurate seat of authority over those without by any means possible most, notably emphasized in Brubeck\u2019s chapter \u2018Wedding Bash\u2019, yet every time the novel is flowing nicely along through societal or interpersonal commentary, the fantasy elements crop up, derail anything beneficial, and speed the plot along towards some unsatisfying and unnecessary fantastic climax (a climax achieved in an orgasm of action-packed psychic battle bloodshed). To humor the idea, what then are the \u2018echos\u2019 that must die? Through each section, right when things get dicey and plot-excitement take hold, there are the repeated questions: \u2018what do you know about Horology?\u2019 or \u2018Who is Esther Little?\u2019. These questions echo on, conjuring up the jarring and, unfortunately for the book, juvenile and cheesy fantasy elements that plague the novel. Mitchell is pointing out how these fantasy stories, the action plots of authors like Lee Child and Dan Brown (both of which are frequently mentioned) are bastardizing the literary tradition. This then leads the reader to question every element of the novel, noticing the glaring cliches and other popular fiction elements flagged by flagrantly poor writing. Which is not to say, exactly, that Mitchell is a poor writer, and I find it troublesome to actually label the writing in this book as 'poor'. Considering the idea that this is an intentional investigation into popular fiction, Mitchell brilliantly succeeds in parodying and highlighting the elements of the novelists and genres he has chosen to examine. Lee Child comes up a few times, an author working within the action-packed political spy genre. The Marinus segments work wonderfully within this genre, and while it seemed to me a bit overblown and pulpy, that is exactly what it is supposed to be. The dialogue of Sadaqat, the housekeeper of the Horologists home-base, does not feel realistic, being overtly passive and chummy and full of home-team pride, but it is exactly this disingenuous dialogue that leads the reader to realize that he is a traitor. When he betrays them, which doesn't come as much of a surprise, it is evident that the flat dialogue was the foreshadowing; Mitchell uses linguistic cues and intentionally 'bad' writing as a method of character development, which is honestly quite fascinating and is in keeping with the style of dialogue such a character would employ in, say, a Lee Child novel. Similarly with the nods to Dan Brown in the Crispin Hershey segment, utilizing the semiotic investigations of a Brown 'connect-the-dots to solve the mystery' plot such as the one-eyed man being used to bait the reader to a false climax (the first is not his killer, and the second is a surprise interpretation). Mitchell is making a play for a wider audience by baiting them with popular fiction, yet simultaneously prodding at the book for employing this technique. However, would a self-respecting author really intentionally stoop to poor writing to make a point? I fully concede to be wrong on all accounts here, because would Mitchell jeopardize his novel and writing-caliber to make a point? I believe he may have taken this risk, as I have faith that Mitchell is wiser and more adept than much of what he presents here, yet even seeing through to the possible mechanics and impetus of the novel do not save it, though they do retain respect for Mitchell as a writer. Even alongside this theory of both utilizing bad fiction while chastising it for a higher purpose of literary conversation, Bone Clocks still fail. The supposed intent does not compensate for the inferior writing, meretricious fantasy elements, and aggravating characters\u2014such as young Holly\u2014that plague the novel and detract from the emotive and intellectual themes of power, corruption and literary prowess that could have shone on their own had their not been a need to tie them together with the Anchorite vs Horologist sub-plot. Each time this plot reared its ugly head it was met with an eye-roll. All the negatives aside, this is a fun book. Mitchell enacts a fascinating and well-rounded theology with the Horologists, creating a within-the-novel jargon and fleshed-out history (impressive at least to me, a reader not well-versed, and even adverse, to the science-fiction realms Mitchell takes the reader throughout this book). The characters are engaging, especially Ed Brubeck, who leaves the reader wishing Mitchell had just written a full-length novel on him alone (though at least we are blessed by war correspondent stories such as \u2018Listening to the Shells\u2019 in William T. Vollmann\u2019s Last Stories and Other Stories \u2014possibly the finest book published in Summer 2014\u2014to satisfy where Mitchell cut short). Mitchell works well with three-dimensional characters like Brubeck who is not without his flaws, and especially Hugo, the books most likeable character who also happens to be a morally bankrupt utter bastard. This is interesting seeing as most popular fiction tends towards relatable, likeable characters that are either irreprochable or flaws that are more charming than anything else. This book is also worth reading for any Mitchell fan simply to see how it fits into his universe. There are frequent allusions to his other works, particularly Black Swan Green in the earlier portions (Alan Ward and Hugo were exciting to revisit) and The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet which may possibly feature an early example of the Anchorites alongside the first mention of Marinus (if this was preordained by Mitchell or just a happy opportunity for expansion is up for debate and could only be resolved by Mitchell himself). Despite my earlier comments on the bland dialogue and, to me, middling prose that comprises the Marinus section, that chapter blazed like wildfire with excitement and glee. While I did not enjoy Bone Clocks , it is admittedly a fun and engaging novel, especially for those who are coming to this from the styles which he parodies. Mitchell returns with fascinating themes on power and the human condition that permeate his other novels. I respect his views on good and evil, and that the world is ruined by those who abuse power to shoehorn their own profit-gaining power over those below them. The section on the Iraq war is of particular interest, as Mitchell manages to summarize the conflict better in a more succinct and beneficial manner than months of news broadcasts explained it to me in my youth. I particularly enjoyed his jabs at American arrogance and his brief mention of war-profiteers such as Erik Prince\u2019s Blackwater group (who are local heros here in hometown Holland, Michigan, much to my disdain). Mitchell has an agenda for the betterment of humanity that is honorable and uplifting, and these themes of his are what always keep me coming back for more. Mitchell does well by gathering a wider readership and creating a fascinating fantasy world that is fun to read, yet the novel feels like he is constantly juggling more than he can carry and is thwarted by a striking mediocrity in variety of voices and satire, though intentional. What is most troubling is that Mitchell seems to be writing for the sake of an audience, a wide audience at that, and not for the sake of the story. Cheapen a book for an audience, and the story suffers. Keep true to a story, and an audience will find their way. That said, I will still read any following Mitchell novels and still hold faith in him as a writer. He is a necessary and wonderful benefactor for those hoping to move from pulpier fiction to a fiction of a more literary bent reminding readers how much fun reading can be. Bone Clocks is a fun adventure, but one soon forgotten upon completion. 2.5/5 ...more \"True metamorphosis doesn't come with flowcharts.\" Another genre-bending novel by David Mitchell also channels Stephen King and Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n.

He not only advances the plot, he advances the reader. \"Power is crack cocaine for the ego and battery acid for the soul.\" Although Cloud Atlas remains my personal favorite of Mitchell's novels, I was no less astonished by the author's ability to chime all his previous books in THE BONE CLOCKS. Some authors, such as Coetzee, will name their protagonists after themselves in the later novels of their oeuvres. This is more and more common as novelists become established and preeminent. However, that has the effect, unfortunately, of removing me from the novel-at-hand. Every time I see the author's name in print on the pages of the latest of his or her fiction, I am jettisoned out the story and into the basking novelist's quasi-biography. Mitchell, rather than transmitting a duplicate self, creates an arterial pathway and an organic conduit from Bone Clocks to all his other novels--Black Swan Green, Number 9 Dream, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, Ghostwritten, and Cloud Atlas at different times in various ways. He bolsters the theme of connection literarily and in temporal and perpetual ways so that time is unleashed, not as a Western mindset, but rather in something like a boundless circle, mounted from an ancient ziggurat, and understood through the all-seeing eye. If that doesn't make a lot of sense, it will when you read it. It would be egregious to spell out this plot, which is its own exciting discovery. But, fans of Mitchell will be familiar with how he can change course and slip into a linguistic detour. Less so in this novel, and BONE CLOCKS coheres more obviously so than CA. Holly Sykes is the clear protagonist, even when she isn't always steering the POV. The book doesn't read so much like separate novellas that run a course together, even though there are six delineated parts; it reads like an epic novel with several turnoffs that lead you back to a central story with fair transparency, but persuades you to visualize a maze of narrative junctures and coronas. If you don't like the paranormal genre, there's a possibility that you might abandon the book at this turn of narrative style, which comprises about 400 pages. There's also a chunk of the dystopian. If you can stick with it, there is much reward that transcends the genre. \"We live on, as long as there are people to live on in.\" ...more Fans of David Mitchell who can remember simple things like characters\u2019 names will enjoy the callbacks to his earlier novels.

And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m saying that just to make myself feel better about having spent the past week reading this book and waiting online to get a signed ARC of the book for about two hours (even though physically it is probably the nicest looking ARC given away at this years BEA). The book roughly follows the life of Holly Sykes who, is first seen in 1984 as a fifteen year old getting into a fight with her mom after mom discovers Holly hadn\u2019t spent the previous night at a friends house but was off shagging her twenty something year old cool guy boyfriend. Mum slaps Holly. Holly packs her bags, gives her parents two fingers in the air and because fifteen year olds always make the best decision, she heads off to live with \u2018the love of her life\u2019. The first section of the book covers fifteen year old (I\u2019ll be sixteen in just a couple of months) Holly\u2019s adventure. The next five sections are each told from a different characters perspective and move linearly through time. In varying degrees each section features Holly and the reader learns more about her and is caught up with what has been happening to her, but in most of these sections it is the other characters who are the real focus of the stories. The way that Mitchell tells the stories in the first four sections is quite good. I wanted to say fun but that might not be the best word to use (although the \u2018Martin Amis\u2019 section is quite fun (it is supposed to be him, right?)), these sections are sort of their own self-contained worlds like the sections of Cloud Atlas , which stand well on their own. He doesn't do the whole genre switching thing here though, or not as blatantly (I\u2019ve been on the fence about this question for the past few minutes\u2014all the time that I spent thinking about what I should write before sitting down to write). Through the end of the fourth section I was fairly sure that I\u2019d give this five stars. It was just so good up until then. If the book ended on page 400 it would have gotten five stars. It\u2019s possible if the book ended with the penultimate section it would have gotten five stars, too. But instead it went on a bit too long for me and I ended up knocking off a star (later decided to be only a half star deduction) because the work as a whole I felt suffered from the last section.

The final section felt \u2018weird\u2019. The second to last section (using that fancy word to say that is just pretentious if you use it more than once in a review) is obviously the climax of the book. It\u2019s told from the point of view of Marinus and the reader gets to discover many of the links that had been hinted at earlier in the book. Then there is the big battle scene, which is a little confusing to me but most big action scenes are and the section ends with Marinus and Hugo making a possible alliance to try to zap themselves out of the Blind Cather\u2019s chapel. That\u2019s fine, I liked it, I felt the battle was a little too D&D for me, and it bordered on what I\u2019ve called Dungeon Master Bullshit at times, but that\u2019s just the my reaction to magic type things and not a real criticism. The comes the final section, which I was looking forward to because it was going to bring Holly back as the narrator, and I like when books come full circle, but it felt weird and preachy. It would be like in Star Wars the Death Star was blown up and then there was another twenty minutes of the characters preaching to you about some issues and then wrapping a loose end that you didn\u2019t even really care all that much about. It felt extra weird since this future world is mentioned by Esther, so at least one of them saw this quite possible future in store for humanity. If only there were people in existence who could do things like completely rewire people\u2019s brains to have them make better decisions about what to do with resources and who had millennia of experience to call upon to maybe try to help the world\u2019s problems? Hmmmmm. There are, but instead of really working towards improving the world they are obsessed with this war with their \u2018evil\u2019 counterparts. Killing children is evil. We will all agree to that. Except maybe for people who like killing children and think they are righteous in their actions, but most people would agree that killing children in order to drink their souls and cheat mortality is probably evil. The good horologists are at war with their evil counterparts because the evil ones kill four people (usually children) a year. The oldest member of this sect is maybe 600 years old, so in the lifetime of the sect say 2,400 people have been killed by these monsters. Now in the future, say just on the day that Aoife dies, her\u2019s and 200 other airplanes are cracked in half by a gigastorm. On the conservative side the average commercial airplane seats 200 (between two and five hundred according to the internets), that means that at least 40,000 people were killed that day from the effects of global warming, which it\u2019s conceivable that since they can re-wire a schizophrenics brain then it would also be conceivable they could tweak the brains of key people who could have caused some lasting change. Their war ends up sounding kind of stupid when you compare say the 80 more kids that would have died between the last two sections and the 40,000 that died in the plane crashes on one day, never mind the people dying of all the diseases and end of civilization shit that is going on. Those 80 kids are nice to save and all, but it is at the cost of a handful of the most powerful people to ever live. It would be like Superman and his buddies got themselves killed in order to save one classroom full of eight year olds (with no alternate universes to bring them back) while a meteor the size of the moon came bearing down Earth. But those twenty kids lived! Eh, right? 2. This section is very accusatory of our gluttonous behaviors and maybe we need to be told to stop taking for granted all the wonderful things we have and see that there is a price we are going to have to pay eventually. It just felt kind of awkward being tacked on to the end here. As I said, it felt very preachy and it didn\u2019t feel like it added much to the story. When the second to last section ended I knew that Holly lived and I figured she would probably eventually die as all people do. And Aoife and her husband would one day die, too. I didn\u2019t need to know when. I guess since it\u2019s in a way Holly\u2019s story seeing how her life ultimately ends would have been nice, but not necessary since it\u2019s not like we saw her before she was a know-it-all fifteen year old punk. And we don\u2019t see how she dies. Or what happened to Hugo Lamb. Or what exactly the script that Crispin Hershey should have been a part of but because he never read the poetry books he squandered, and maybe what side his killer had been on in the \u2018war\u2019. After the big climax I just wasn\u2019t ready to get emotionally invested in some new characters and while it\u2019s nice that Holly\u2019s granddaughter gets whisked off to the paradise of Iceland I didn\u2019t need to know that. The last section was too much for me. Too much new plot but not enough space for there to be enough development for me to really get involved in it. Does that make sense? It was too much world building just to basically tell me that the world was in the shitter and Marinus is still looking out for people close to Holly. And is Iceland really a haven? How long until the Chinese or Russians come and take over the small island and put it in the crapper with the rest of the world? (hide spoiler) ] Phew, I rambled a bunch there. I might have been a little harsh but it\u2019s only because I loved the first parts of the book so much. What I didn\u2019t like so much didn\u2019t ruin it for me, but maybe made it a 4.5 instead of a 5 star book. ...more I once wrote a novel like this. My agent wisely advised me to split it up into two novellas. I did. I wish Mitchell's agent had given the same advice. He or she didn't. Too bad.

It's a tempting trap, this splicing together of novellas. I know, I've been caught in it myself. It makes the writer's job much easier. And it's clever, to boot. In the case of The Bone Clocks , however, this strategy backfired, creating a novel divided against itself. I'll spare you the plot overview for three reasons: 1) others have already given fantastic overviews (see, particularly, reviews by AmberBug , Jenny (Reading Envy) , and Greg ). 2) Any plot outline is bound to contain inadvertent spoilers. 3) I'm feeling rather tired from other, writerly projects. So let's focus on structure and characterization. The internal schism in the book isn't about plot, anyway. It's about pacing, emphasis, and characterization, more than anything else. The first 2/3rds of the book were, frankly, overwrought. And by that, I don't mean that the language was overly purple or the syntactical structure too complex. In fact, I found quite the opposite. Mitchell was careful to portray salt-of-the-earth characters and jaded characters as if they were almost Jungian archetypes of naive teenagers and hedonistic twenty-somethings, respectively. Mitchell tried really, really hard to get these characterizations across. Too hard. You could tell that he was trying. Time and again, I felt that Mitchell was trying so hard to make his characters - \"trendy\" or \"hip\" are the words that come to mind - that they ended up being pastiches of the very ideal for which the author was aiming. They became, in a word, distracting, like that guy who so wants to be the center of attention at a party that he wears a rainbow afro wig. Everyone sees him there, making everyone laugh. But guess who's not going home with the girl? Now, I've read (and written) my share of annoying and despicable characters. But these characters, by and large, threw me out of the story. Later, when said characters returned (in later sections), I found it extremely difficult to accept them. My brain wanted to reject them, and I found myself becoming angry at the author for having screwed these characters up in an attempt to be \"literary\". And there is the biggest structural problem with the book. In the first 2/3rds, Mitchell seems to be making a conscious effort to appear \"literary\". I'm not sure why - it's obvious from his previous work that he has writing \"chops\". I don't know what he was trying to prove, but he tried so hard that he failed. He over-thought the first part of the book. Only in section 3, \"The Wedding Bash\" does Mitchell's auctorial *voice* sound genuine and natural. This third section is exceptional, and would have made a brilliant novella by itself. As it stands in relation to the rest of the plot, however, it feels as if it has been awkwardly welded-on to the rest of the novel, weakening the overall product. Really, this section is some of the best writing I've read in a while. Mitchell's got chops . . . in doses. The next section, \"Crispin Hershey's Lonely Planet\" is indulgent, and not in a good way. Perhaps I'm missing some hidden humor about Mitchell's experience as a well-known writer. If so, the inside jokes are, well, a little *too* inside. And, like the third section, this bit seems tacked on, hardly relevant, except in a few small points which could have been distilled down to a few pages. In fact, I believe that the first 350 pages of this novel could have been brought down to about 100, and Mitchell would have not only a heck of a novella (in \"The Wedding Bash,\" which I like to call the \"Baghdad section\"), but a great novel, as well. Because, you see, it gets better. Much, much better. Had Mitchell not stretched out the first half of the book to three-times the length it should have been(to be fair, the blame might lay with the editor), you'd be reading a five star review. No kidding: The last half-ish of the book is THAT good. It's in the tale of the Horologists, and beyond, that the author really hits his stride. Here things get weird and exciting, two things which I like very much in a novel. Gone is the pretense of trying to please The New Yorker crowd. The catering to angry teenagers has thankfully died away. And Mitchell reveals that he is a heck of a writer when he lets his hair down, takes off his tie, and gets down to really letting himself fly as a writer. But, wait. \"What\", you ask, \"is a Horologist\"? I'm not telling. I'll leave it as a surprise. But suffice it to say that once we understand a little bit about them, all hell breaks loose. Really, everything goes crazy. Not just for the characters directly in the path of the immediate action, the ones in a psychic conflict between superhuman beings, but for the whole planet. Now, before you go blaming the Horologists (after all, their organization sounds so . . . prostitutional - which isn't even a word, but you get my point), know that while they are powerful, they are far from all-powerful. They are at the mercy of mankind's collective bad decisions, just like the rest of the world. And while reading the last section of the book might make the reader feel that he is taking a beating from a pedantic stick wielded by Greenpeace, it does set things up for what I must admit is a very emotional ending. I found myself staying up late because I had to finish the book. Mitchell compelled me, by making me viscerally-involved and emotionally-invested in the characters at the end of the book. Finally, finally, I could forget the forced too-cool-to-be-true feeling of the first part of the book and enjoy myself, really let myself get steeped in the characters' thoughts and emotions, and feel their fear, love, and longing in my bones. Yeah, I had to reach for the tissue. There were tears. Still, there was a time when I wanted to stop reading the book. And I am not one to stop reading books, no matter how bad. But I was tempted to close this one up and take it to the used book store. Oh, I was sorely tempted. Thankfully, I pushed through and it was just a tiny bit after I peeked over that wall (and it was a big wall), that it got better. Ultimately, it was a victory. But a Pyrrhic victory. I may be recovering from this novel, both the good and the bad parts, for some time to come. ...more By the middle of the first sentence, I knew I was in for it.

Narrative Structure and Plot It's a relatively straightforward narrative for Michell: a chronological story of one life. However, like Cloud Atlas and Ghostwritten, it is also a collection of related stories, in different styles and genres (like CA, it's in six parts). In this case, the first and last sections are narrated by the central character (Holly), and the other four, by those playing a key role during that episode of her life. In Mitchell\u2019s own words (jotted down almost verbatim) in an interview on BBC Radio 2\u2019s Book Club: A murderous feud between two circles of pseudo immortals: one benign and one decidedly predatory. It erupts every ten years or so. Holly moves from pawn to decisive weapon, as she develops from being primarily a daughter, through lover, to mother, improbable and reluctant bestselling writer, (he missed out the fifth one, but I\u2019d say confused combatant), and finally, battle-scarred grandmother. It\u2019s about mortality, and several characters are offered a Faustian pact: keep your youth in return for having your conscience amputated. (Mind you, there\u2019s at least one character who rather lacking in the conscience department, even without such a pact.) But although it's ostensibly about a woman, it's always in relation to the men she encounters, and most of them are pretty unpleasant. So really, it's about men. There's no reason why it shouldn't be, but I think it's only fair to point out a potential wrong expectation. It could easily and satisfactorily have ended after the fifth section, but didn\u2019t, which I\u2019m glad about, despite the sharp contrast. I\u2019ve described the key features of each section in my detailed review. Common Threads As with all Mitchell's books, this one features characters from and references to his other works. Most have a peripheral role here (there's no need to be familiar with their other appearances), but one major character was significant in The Thousand Autumns ( https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... ), making that book seem much less of a straightforward historical novel than it appeared at the time. In Mitchell\u2019s own words, \u201c Each of my novels are expanders or chapters in a kind of uber-book, a piece of a universe that all my novels are making \u201d. It started out as fun, but \"I\u2019m building a coherent, megalomaniac's, large-scale world of an uber-novel\". Very recently, he said: \u201cI think I have recently discovered I am basically not a novelist, I am a novella writer. If you put novella A next to novella B then they \u2013 interact isn\u2019t right \u2013 smack off each other, they glint at each other . They possibly echo or reflect each other, and make a third thing.\u201d (From http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-ent... .) Mitchell's favoured themes of power, predacity, exploitation, contrasted with sacrifice, mortality, islands, lifeboats (in a loose sense) and refuge are strong. Migrating souls are central, and there are other touchpoints, such as music, and life approaching or after societal collapse. There's a comprehensive list my other review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... Mixed Genres and Age Groups The early sections have a few incidents that might be paranormal or just psychological, but it's all broadly realistic. Only later does it turn overtly fantastical (at which point you begin to realise some of the foreshadowing in earlier sections) and it's more like something by Philip Pullman (or perhaps Dan Brown, who I haven't read). Swapping genres is a trick Mitchell has pulled off well before, but this feels like switching age groups, which may be why it feels more jarring. The contrast between the very realistic (I assume) sections set in the Iraq war and the more YA fantastical war in the later parts is a powerful disconnect. Is that a strength or a weakness? I'm not sure. What Price Immortality? This question is never explicitly asked, but it screams from the pages. Would I want to live forever, even if such an ability was benignly acquired? Probably not (what about friends and family?), and yet, there\u2019s always one more enticing experience. Mitchell himself says he chose the motivation for the evil protagonists based on what would tempt him: not money or sex, but \"never having to stop... never having to end... not having to say \"goodbye\" to this world\". Even one who has lived through many lives fears \u201cWill I die without ever reading Ulysses to the end?\u201d. I haven\u2019t even started that! Then again, as one mortal says, \u201cWe sort of live on, as long as there are people to live on in\u201d, meaning grandchildren, whether biological or just a younger generation one has influenced. Memory Cleansing Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to erase bad memories, as could be done by some in this book? If you\u2019ve seen \u201cEternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind\u201d, you may be less sure. But without the bad, the good would seem less good, and our lives would lack colour and contrast. Also, what if you knew something had been erased? \u201cWhen you know your memory\u2019s been monkeyed around with once, how can you ever be sure of any memory again?\u201d And \u201cIf you can\u2019t trust your mind any more, you\u2019re mentally homeless.\u201d I think for most of us, we\u2019re probably better off keeping most of our memories. Weaknesses Quite a few, I\u2019m afraid: Some of the narrators were annoying: teenage Holly didn\u2019t ring true (and used odd abbreviations) and Crispin Hershey alternates between first and third person for himself. One of the irritations is how knowing this book is: Mitchell pre-empts some of the more obvious criticisms by applying them to a book that (like this) jumps oddly into fantasy, and having a character acknowledging a deus ex machina by that label. There\u2019s a lot more about these aspects in my lengthier review. Conversely, lack of knowing is an issue: on at least two occasions a narrator has a memory wiped \u2013 and yet they\u2019re able to describe before, during and after. Spotting cross-overs with his other books can be fun, and it creates a broader canvas for an uber-book or universe, but occasionally it feels like gratuitous showing-off. However, one can never be certain there isn't a good reason, yet to be revealed, so I end up forgiving him. The sections describing reporting from a war zone are very well done, but there was just too much of it for my taste \u2013and most of it wasn\u2019t very relevant for this book (but who knows about future ones?). A trivial but (for me) distracting feature was the excessive use of names with all manner of accents, even for English characters. Just because computer typesetting makes it easy, doesn't make it desirable. He even throws in the most famous line from Game of Thrones (it must be famous, as I've neither read nor watched it) - or maybe that was just co-incidence. Strength \u2013 So Much And yet... and yet... even though I didn't care enough about any of the characters until the very end (which is not the same as liking them, which is not something I need to enjoy a book) I was keen to keep reading at every opportunity, and am glad I did. And now that I've finished, I find I have SO much to mull over, I realise what a powerful book it is. Closing Thoughts \u201cFor one voyage to begin, another voyage must come to an end, sort of.\u201d I think that sums up Mitchell\u2019s approach to his novels. QUOTES \u2022\tA bone clock \u201cwhose face betrays how very, very little time they have left.\u201d \u2022\t\u201cThere\u2019s the thirsty sky and the wide river full of ships and boats and stuff.\u201d \u2022\t\u201cWhat if heaven is real, but only in moments?

He is spiritual, but also seems to leave room for a bit of humanist doubt. I can't think of another writer who captures the energy or direction of the slick, urban, cosmopolitan, educated, 21st century global zeitgeist. David Mitchell is brilliant at ventriloquism and style-jumping. His books are filled with multiple narrative and style incarnations (the stacking-doll Cloud Atlas , or narrative leaping number9dream , or his most recent The Bone Clocks ), but sometime I feel like he is starting to eat his own tail here. I want to see Mitchell do a Peter Carey and jump out of his slick, crowd-pleasing novels into something a bit different. Do I know what I want? No. I just see this author who I've liked enough to read everything he's ever published, and fear that we might just get two or three more of these books. I like them. Don't get me wrong. I liked the Bone Clocks enough to give it four stars and review and read it. I just don't want to see Mitchell begin to get so comfortable in his archipelago of interconnected narratives that he doesn't push his talent into dark, rough, and uncomfortable places. Anyway, Mitchell hasn't written a novel YET that I'm very disappointed with and Bone Clocks is no exception. There might be a couple slower chapters and the ending might have been a bit predictable, but I had a hard time putting the novel down while reading and was sad to put it down when I finished.

The book sounds incredible, Richard.\" How can a novel so replete with cynicism and sadness, where beloved characters are vanished and the world spins heedlessly toward doom, be so much dang fun? David Mitchell, that\u2019s why (by the way, this novel is not about Richard Cheeseman). If you\u2019ve not read David Mitchell before, I wouldn\u2019t recommend you start here, because I don\u2019t think The Bone Clocks is his best, but it does overflow with all the features that make his writing such a joy to read: the nested Russian Doll plotting; the marvel of authorial ventriloquism\u2014where he can inhabit any character and produce any voice with astonishing believability; the soaring heights of detail and imagination; the sheer precipices of suspense and drama. The Bone Clocks is a delight of storytelling, even if some of its parts weaken the strength of the whole. The novel is series of interlocking narratives, with the character of Holly Sykes at its core. I adore Holly, from her na\u00efve teenage defiance in Thatcher and Talking Heads England of 1984 to her world-weary rebellion as an old woman in dystopian 2043, scrapping away on a remote peninsula in southwest Ireland. Young Holly stumbles into paranormal mishaps after running away from home in the book's opening section, but she\u2019s being used as a vessel and her memory is wiped clean. The reader remains fully aware, however, and we next encounter Holly in Switzerland in 1991. She is incidental to the story here, which is narrated by the pretentious Oxbridge brat, Hugo Lamb. The drug and trust fund-induced capers of his posh friends find Hugo sliding down a pitched roof and into Holly\u2019s thin, pale arms. Yet, this is a tale of star-crossed lovers, for Hugo is borne away by a supernatural force and the story speeds off on a new track, right into 2004, where Ed Brubeck is waiting. Ed\u2019s been waiting a long time, really, for he helped his schoolmate Holly out of a jam in 1984. Twenty years later, he is Holly\u2019s partner and the father of their beloved Aoife. Now Ed himself is in quite a jam. He\u2019s a war correspondent who has led his family to believe he\u2019s leaving the front lines in Iraq (\u201cBad Dad,\u201d little Aoife calls Baghdad), but he\u2019s just accepted a six-month extension and doesn\u2019t know how to tell Holly he\u2019s addicted to war. At this point, we\u2019re halfway through the novel and I\u2019m eating it up. I love the occasional teases that something Huge Is About To Happen, the intersecting storylines, the reluctant heroine of Holly Sykes, the hurtling of the past and present toward a murky future. Then we enter \"Crispin Hershey\u2019s Lonely Planet,\" the fourth installment of The Bone Clocks and the last set in the known world. It is narrated by the largely despicable and wholly caustic writer, Crispin Hershey, whose authorial star is plummeting to earth. Crispin\u2019s tale is a meta-fiction romp through the world of literati, circa Now. It\u2019s ripe black comedy, for Crispin is such a pathetic sot, and although it takes a good long while for the character\u2019s place in the story maze to define itself, we see Holly shimmering at the edges. She has recently published a blockbuster memoir, The Radio People , and her success embitters the already vinegared Hershey, yet they become friends. I'm still entertained but the bizarre and pathetic Hershey, but beginning to drift during this overlong section, longing to return to Holly\u2019s inner circle. Should be careful what I wish for. Section Five. Ah yes, much has been written about Section Five, its graphic novel cinematic scope the cause of debate amongst serious critics, so I won\u2019t belabor the point. You may love this part, you may wrestle your way through it (likely a bit of both). But you must pay attention, for here all is revealed\u2014the paranormal mystery explained, the battle between good and evil carried out in a stone chapel\u2014and it\u2019s very easy to get discombobulated. The characters move between bodies and minds and I myself got a little lost, finding the explanations and the action rather tedious at times. But I was helpless to resist. And the reward is . . . Sheep\u2019s Head Peninsula, West Cork, Ireland, the year 2043. Maybe I love this finale so much because I\u2019ve hiked those craggy hills and been stung by the cold sea spray and it was there I fell so helplessly in love with Ireland, but really, I could spend a whole novel inside this beautiful and desperate end. I won\u2019t tell you any more. I wish . . . I\u2019m not sure what I wish. That the central themes had been more profound? That the metaphysical element had been less the stuff of comic-book heroes and more carefully threaded through the narrative? That David Mitchell had spent less time with the boorish Crispin Hershey and given us more of Holly Syke\u2019s delicately fierce intellect? Yes, I wish all that. Yet, it took me a few days to regain my reading balance after finishing The Bone Clocks . The world, and all the other words in it, seemed pale and diminished after being absorbed by Mitchell\u2019s. ...more Meanwhile...at the Frankfurt Book Fair 8 to 12 October, 2014 David Mitchell caught trying to sneak into the Frankfurt Book Fair for free.

Like Thomas Pynchon and Haruki Murakami \u2014 to whom he\u2019s often compared \u2014 Mitchell excites his culty fan base into fits of rapture. One bookseller told me that a customer offered money to be allowed to sit in the store and read an advance copy of \u201cThe Bone Clocks.\u201d Named a finalist for the Booker Prize more than a month before publication, the novel has finally descended incarnate from the mind of this divinely inventive author. Like \u201cCloud Atlas,\u201d one of Mitchell\u2019s earlier novels shortlisted for the Booker, \u201cThe Bone Clocks\u201d presents a curio cabinet of apparently disparate stories, but readers should be onto his tricks by now. The presumption of an interconnected puzzle hangs over these narrators as though Mitchell\u2019s oeuvre were some massive literary sudoku. Devout Mitchellians are already cross-referencing the names and locales of \u201cThe Bone Clocks\u201d in the ever-accreting concordance to his works. (Why, there\u2019s Jason Taylor\u2019s cousin from \u201cBlack Swan Green.\u201d And my, my \u2014 it seems like a thousand autumns since we last saw Dr. Marinus.) But don\u2019t let the high walls of his fan club intimidate you. This new novel offers up a rich selection of domestic realism, gothic fantasy and apocalyptic speculation, stretching around the world from the Margaret Thatcher era of the 1980s to the Endarkenment of 2043. (Alas, it turns out that the climate-change deniers were wrong. You might want to put up some root vegetables before winter.) At the center of this cunning arrangement of nested tales is a strong-willed 15-year-old named Holly Sykes. We meet her in the summer of 1984 when she runs away from home to move in with Vin, a 24-year-old car salesman who wears a leather jacket embroidered with the words \u201cLed Zep\u201d in silver studs. He can play the intro to \u201cStairway to Heaven.\u201d Quite the catch! \u201cVin and me could start a band,\u201d Holly thinks. In a twist that will surprise young teens everywhere, that love match doesn\u2019t pan out, but Holly continues running for a few days just to give her mum a good scare. This jaunty, first-person picaresque is filled with the young woman\u2019s pop culture and school-hall concerns \u2014 and so many discombobulating clues to future mysteries that it sometimes feels as if the ink from another novel were bleeding through the pages. Having grown up over her parents\u2019 pub in Kent, Holly displays a tragicomic mix of confidence and naivete, which Mitchell balances endearingly to keep her from seeming like an object of mockery. As she confidentially chats away, we catch glimpses of what she calls her mind\u2019s \u201cnutso part,\u201d the \u201cWeird S---\u201d \u2014 including muffled chatter from the Radio People in her head and visits from a golden-haired fairy godmother who once, conveniently, pushed a schoolyard tyrant in front of a van. But that\u2019s just crazy talk \u2014 right? \u2014 easy to brush over as Holly wrestles with the real-life challenges of finding food and shelter on the lam. Subsequent sections \u2014 in different places, at different times, with different characters \u2014 continue this pattern: intensely compelling confessions that seem wholly realistic, except for those incongruous moments of fantasy that poke through like carpet tacks. Some of these narrators are moving and sympathetic; others radiate the metastasizing creepiness of a Patricia Highsmith villain. Their stories evolve in subtly distinctive tones and forms that reflect their outlooks. An ambitious journalist, for instance, is bored at a family wedding, his mind ricocheting from marital festivities to Iraq bombings, until a crisis close to home scares him more than anything in Fallujah. How entirely different that tightly focused family drama feels from the glib sociopath who glides from one ingenious swindle to the next, assuring us that anyone \u201cspared love is spared grief.\u201d The most irresistible section is narrated by a bitter novelist named Crispin Hershey, whom a TV interviewer describes as \u201ca master stylist and a laser-sharp chronicler of our times.\u201d In this tour de force satire of literary culture and its roiling jealousies, Mitchell has created \u201cthe Wild Child of British Letters,\u201d a writer \u201cso bent on avoiding cliche that each sentence is as tortured as an American whistleblower.\u201d It\u2019s a fantastically witty section, like tumbling into a Martin Amis novel (an early, good one). Crispin scorns his bestselling competitors, including an author working on a novel that sounds something like \u201cThe Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet.\u201d He lusts after others\u2019 fame as he\u2019s driven deeper into debt and the circuit of inane writing conferences. (In one particularly humiliating moment, he\u2019s mistaken for Jeffrey Archer.) His public battle with a feminist scholar \u2014 a \u201cbigoted blob of trans fat\u201d \u2014 recalls the good old slugfests of Mailer and Vidal before authors grew so darn polite with each other. When Crispin\u2019s new book is harpooned by a sharp review, the aggrieved novelist has no choice but to react to the \u201cpube-bearded\u201d critic with equal and opposite force: \u201cEthics are Newtonian,\u201d he warns us. But in fact, the ethics of this novel are anything but Newtonian; they\u2019re all spooky action. As these characters spin into the 21st century, their morality is reshaped and redirected by quirks and quarks they couldn\u2019t possibly anticipate. Some will steal or kill for money or fame. And what wouldn\u2019t one do for mind control, telekinetics, even immortality? That\u2019s the weird strain running throughout these stories: As time is etched on the bodies of the mortals \u2014 mere \u201cbone clocks\u201d \u2014 they\u2019re periodically enlisted by \u201cAtemporals,\u201d participants in a metaphysical battle waged over the centuries beneath the shade of the material world. That fantastical mystery smolders away under hundreds of pages, but when it finally bursts into flames in the novel\u2019s fifth and longest section, it throws off surprisingly little heat. While Mitchell explains the characters\u2019 obscure connections to each other, he suspends the novel\u2019s serious philosophical and moral tenor in favor of an adolescent moral code and some vague theological iconography. In fulfillment of the Script \u2014 something like fate or prophecy \u2014 two ancient camps, the vampiric Anchorites and the body-snatching Horologists, try to psycho-demolish each other in a blind Cathar\u2019s castle. It is, as one character needlessly explains, \u201ca fight to the death,\u201d but the whole enterprise feels as worn as the stone walls of Hogwarts. Too earnest to be a parody of old fantasies, it\u2019s laced with tinfoil \u2019n\u2019 Scotch-tape lines such as \u201cI revoke my cloak and invoke a body-shield.\u201d The evil overlord is an elegant and sardonic fiend somewhere on the scary scale between Ernst Stavro Blofeld and the Penguin. His evil villainess actually shrieks, \u201cCrush them like ants!\u201d We climb this steep mountain expecting that we will be rewarded with the wizardry of \u201cThe Night Circus,\u201d \u201cThe Magicians\u201d or \u201cJonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\u201d \u2014 but somehow, as \u201cThe Bone Clocks\u201d winds up for its long-anticipated climax, Mitchell abandons his exploration of character, sexuality, class and politics for an old warlock\u2019s sack of cliches. In the words of one of the book\u2019s courageous, jargon-laden soldiers, the \u201cpsychovoltage is low.\u201d Fortunately, the author doesn\u2019t leave us in this knock-off version of \u201cHarry Potter.\u201d Instead, for its finale, the novel jumps ahead to a surprising time and place, and we\u2019re back to the real world of rapacious men and women and the good souls who must confront them. It\u2019s another story entirely, another example of Mitchell\u2019s boundless dexterity. By this point, some of these characters are familiar and beloved, which makes their increasingly lawless era all the more terrifying. And Mitchell makes a strong case that it\u2019s coming our way. Atemporals should be fine; the rest of us bone clocks might want to get busy and see if the Script can be changed after all. This review was first published in The Washington Post : http://www.washingtonpost.com/enterta... ...more I adore David Mitchell. To pieces. No novel has simultaneously so moved and impressed and entertained me as has Cloud Atlas , and I will always be an enthusiastic Mitchell devotee / groupie / fan-girl. But did I adore The Bone Clocks ? With great disappointment, I must confess that I did not (notwithstanding the fact that I devoured the novel over the course of just three of four days). The Bone Clocks is fantastical dreck camouflaged as literature. Don't get me wrong: I have nothing against fantasy I adore David Mitchell. To pieces. No novel has simultaneously so moved and impressed and entertained me as has Cloud Atlas , and I will always be an enthusiastic Mitchell devotee / groupie / fan-girl. But did I adore The Bone Clocks ? With great disappointment, I must confess that I did not (notwithstanding the fact that I devoured the novel over the course of just three of four days). The Bone Clocks is fantastical dreck camouflaged as literature. Don't get me wrong: I have nothing against fantasy novels per se . (See, e.g., The Magicians , one of my all-time favorite novels, which pulls a far weightier punch than its jacket blurb could possibly convey.) And Mitchell's previous works have not infrequently delved into the fantastical, often with considerable success (e.g., the strange but riveting middle section of The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet ). But here, the fantastical is grotesquely overdone (see also: contrived, artificial, unconvincing, inane, over-determinative) \u2013 particularly after Mitchell gives it center stage in the novel's fifth section \u2013 and it overwhelms and cheapens everything that comes beforehand and afterward. This shortcoming of The Bone Clocks is compounded by the fact that the novel's fantastical backbone does not serve any more substantive thematic purpose \u2013 i.e., does not undergird a meditation on metaphysics, or ethics, or the meaning of life, or love, or fate \u2013 but is instead seemingly presented as pure storytelling, as pure plot. (Cf. The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August , which is, as far as speculative fiction goes, the far superior book.) There were intimations of an outstanding novel here: the character of Holly Sykes, her family's coping with the mysterious disappearance of Holly's younger brother, and the two loves of Holly's life, particularly the caddish sociopath Hugo Lamb, first introduced in Mitchell's Black Swan Green , who is perhaps the most compelling yet sadly under-utilized anti-hero I have ever encountered in literature. But all of that is overshadowed by \"psychosoterics,\" and chakras, and a centuries-long battle between the supernatural forces of good and evil, none of which is convincingly developed. To be clear, The Bone Clocks is not a largely compelling yet imperfect work of literary or even speculative fiction; it is instead a fundamentally flawed patchwork that collectively crumbles under its own overwrought weight. If it had been written by any other author, I would likely award it three reluctant stars. But I will not condescend to David Mitchell with artificially inflated ratings that his novels do not deserve. See also Stephen M's review here . ...more Some of these books of David Mitchell are odd and some of them feel almost epic, while still others are just shocking by how much strong voice coming through the page, and some have it all. This is one of those books, the closest novel to Cloud Atlas out of all the books of his that I've read. It shares the same basic concept of loosely-tied novellas with strange immortal creatures either living their lives among the humans or actively engaging in a far-ranging and explosive war with others a bit Some of these books of David Mitchell are odd and some of them feel almost epic, while still others are just shocking by how much strong voice coming through the page, and some have it all. This is one of those books, the closest novel to Cloud Atlas out of all the books of his that I've read. It shares the same basic concept of loosely-tied novellas with strange immortal creatures either living their lives among the humans or actively engaging in a far-ranging and explosive war with others a bit like them, but one thing is certain, they're firmly ensconced in broad stretches of time, even if they're able to hop through history. I love the SF features of these books perhaps more than most who read Mitchell's books, because it's my primary fascination. However, taken in context with everything else that's going on for the majority of the novel, it can appear rather strange. For one, we're constantly and deeply immersed in the lives of the main characters, and whether or not we're a young girl who hears things or a famous author having a wild time amongst his peers, breaking conventions and fourth-walls, we're often so deep in the setting and these minds that when the SF stuff comes around, it's rather a shock. Well, to me, it's rather fun, but these are the things that tie all these wildly different novellas together even more than common themes such as counting time. We all live in bone clocks, after all, experiencing birth and growing old, and it's kind of a fun feeling to experience it outside the loop both as a reader and as another character, too. I am undeniably impressed by the writing chops and the overall sense of structure, the crystal clear voices, and the huge array of techniques, but to be honest, it often feels either too-understated with the ideas it's trying to push across the page or they're lost in the wide world of admittedly interesting scenes and events. For example, before the slow but interesting fall of civilization in our near future, we had a what might have been a pretty cool and exciting end to the whole novel, but while the structure is undoubtably done for some purpose that eludes me at the moment, I'm left with the feeling that I'd have liked the novel better with just a slight rearrangement. You know, a bang at the end instead of a long decline after the bang. I'm often reading this novel while scratching my head, marvelling at the mastery and wondering if I'm missing something. Sure, I can bring my brain to the table and construct something appropriately deconstructionist to match the craziness in the earlier novella, but is that even appropriate outside of that novella? There's a lot of different writing styles in play, and I assume the author is attempting to lead us through dimensional doors with different cultures and outlooks, so why would he force us to a DFW dance while we're blowing up our enemies with psi-bombs? No Comprende. On the other hand, if I'm just meant to go along for the ride and piece together whatever I want out of it, then I guess the novel is doing it's job admirably, but Mitchell writing somewhat schizophrenically and I kinda wonder if he ought to choose between the amorphous readings or the strict ones. There's such a tight voice in each, I kept looking carefully for the strict, from connection to connection, but it was really frustrating unless I just let my eyes un-focus. You know what I mean? Everything is there and clear if I just let go, but in the meantime, all that effort was kinda wasted. So I got a little frustrated. No big deal. I enjoyed the novel as entertainment, and enjoyed it even more as it gave me more and more huge glimpses and even a grand outline of the entire connected worlds between the rest of his novels. That part was very satisfying, indeed. It's just the satisfaction of this novel by itself that suffered a bit, as if it needed either a grand and merciless editor or the freedom to be two or three times as long as it actually is. (And it's a pretty hefty book already.) :) Very decent and well worth it to Mitchell fans. Not my favorite, but it is kind of necessary for global enjoyment. :) ...more I tried, I really did.

I should have just left it at that \u2013 end of review. But instead I probed deep into the internet\u2019s entrails to find a piece that captures and exceeds the idiosyncrasies of my own view. Snippets from a review by Rich Kaserman in The Grumpus : Has the \u201cMild Child of British Letters\u201d grown claws and fangs? With Mitch Davies\u2019 latest, Temporal Flesh , the bonhomie we saw in many previous characters gives way to an air of testiness instead, and his world view goes from bad yet hopeful to bad and likely to get worse. Some may say, \u201cGood damn deal \u2013 it\u2019s about time that he saw the dark,\u201d but they were never part of his chirpy fan base to begin with. \u2026 We first meet Haley Sipes in 1984 as a somewhat disaffected 15-year-old. She narrates the first section and appears in every section thereafter. In contrast to Jared Tyler, an insightful and creative contemporary of hers in Davies\u2019 earlier Green Swan Commons , she is in most ways unremarkable. Perhaps that\u2019s the point. Things happen to ordinary people, too. \u2026 Hugh Woolworth is as self-interested as they come, and he feels no compunction whatsoever trampling toes in pursuit of his wants. He believes it\u2019s better still when his marks fail to see through his oleaginous charms. Hugh also has the best, most acerbic wit; a devious and droll fellow. Within his advantaged tribe, he\u2019s known as the scholarship boy \u2013 clever, but not born to money. His insights into class distinctions are worth repeating: [...] while the wealthy are no more likely to be born stupid than the poor, a wealthy upbringing compounds stupidity while a hardscrabble childhood dilutes it, if only for Darwinian reasons. This is why the elite need a prophylactic barrier of shitty state schools, to prevent clever kids from working-class post codes ousting them from the Enclave of Privilege. Haley held her own when she met Hugh, which certainly interested him. She\u2019d had years to perfect her standoffishness. As far as edgy amusement is concerned, Davies reached his peak at this stage. Too bad he couldn\u2019t sustain it for the remaining two-thirds of the book. \u2026 Cris Reese was meant to have an enticing negativity as well. But the truth is, he\u2019s unoriginal. He might just as well have been named Martin Amis for as thin as the veil turned out to be. Consider the evidence: Reese had a reputation for a drunken and libidinous lifestyle, had a famous father who wrote books that were hard to live up to, and early writing successes like Desiccated Embryos (as compared to Amis\u2019s Dead Babies ) lost luster with each new attempt to regain glory. Davies, in an interview, said this not an Amis send-up but rather a cautionary tale to himself. How many of us buy that? When you decide to break bad, you\u2019ve got to own your contempt, Mitch. \u2026 It\u2019s hard to decide which is worse \u2013 the backpedalling (above) or the attempt to front-run criticism (below) with a preemptive joke on himself. This was from a critic\u2019s review of Reese\u2019s latest effort: So why is Echo Must Die such a decomposing hog? One: Reese is so bent on avoiding clich\u00e9 that each sentence is as tortured as an American whistleblower. Two: The fantasy subplot clashes so violently with the book's State of the World pretensions, I cannot bear to look. Three: What surer sign is there that the creative aquifers are dry than a writer creating a writer-character?\" Speaking of violently clashing fantasy subplots, we get a stylized Armageddon when the Chronologues (in white hats) vie against the Ballastards (in black), all to minimal effect. What could Davies do, though, when his latest spin of the genre roulette wheel landed smack dab on fantasy? With this choice, we may wonder: Did the supernatural help get us to a greater truth? (Not really.) Were the atemporals important for making his point? (Probably not, though to be fair, do we know what the point was?) Did it fit as a piece within the Davies omni-world? (Yeah, I guess that was it.) One of the Chronologues said, \u201cSome magic is merely normality that you're not yet used to.\u201d And other magic, I\u2019m here to point out, is just some writer\u2019s random effluveum. Beyond its gratuitous feel, this section simply failed as a showcase for Davies\u2019 talent. If the chameleon he\u2019s become was trying to spoof bad fantasy that\u2019s one thing, but it\u2019s not clear this was the case. And even if it was, to what benefit? My annoyance compounded with each passage like this: \"The Act of Anesthesia is done. As per the plan, then: Marinus and Unalaq, you hiatus the icon to ensure he won't wake while Arkady, Oshima, and I psychoflame with every volt we've got.\" It made me want to self-administer an Act of Amnesia and pseudosomatically hurl with every erg in my being. While I\u2019m piling on, I might as well mention this habit the Chronologues had of conversing with one another through unspoken mental means they called \u201csubspeaking.\u201d We get dissonant constructions like \u201csubaddress\u201d, \u201csubreply\u201d and \u201csubpoint out.\u201d An editor should have subsuggested dropping the contrived subspeech. \u2026 Recognizing yet again the genre rotation, the repeated characters from previous books, and the linked novella structure, it\u2019s fair to ask if the Davies bag of tricks is looking a bit threadbare from overuse. As something of a counterpoint, I also found this book report that high school sophomore Stephie Botopp wrote. Though lacking sophistication, it spoke to me (which is not to say that it subspoke). Temporal Flesh by Mitch Davies has many interesting characters, settings and themes. The six stories connect through Haley Sipes and the Radio People who sometimes show up like spirits to talk to her. In the first section of the book Haley is 15 and she talks about her bossy mom, her sketchy older boyfriend, and her insane times when she ran away from her home in England. In the second section Haley is in her twenties and she works at a Swiss ski resort restaurant. There\u2019s this hilarious guy, Hugh, who\u2019s sketchy in a different way, but he\u2019s smart, and he kind of falls for Haley. But one of those spirits (atemporals, they were called) asked him to join up with them and never age and go to battle against some other bunch of atemporals who were the good ones. The guy was skeezy enough to do it and he stood Haley up. Then the third section was when Haley was in her thirties and she was married and had a kid, Aiouf, which bothered me a little because how do you pronounce that? Her husband was OK, but he was a war correspondent who would go after the hot story even when his family needed him. The section after that was told from Cris Reese\u2019s point of view. He was called the Wild Child of British Letters when he was young but by the time of this section he was old and just plain nasty. His books were getting worse and he would get into word fights all the time. A critic, who was one of the students that Hugh hung around with in the second section, ripped Reese\u2019s latest book to shreds. The critic got into huge trouble, though, even though he was innocent. It was like an eye for an eye wasn\u2019t enough. Reese took an eye, a tooth, part of an ear, and some fingers. In this section Haley is now old, like in her forties. She got to know Reese because she wrote a book everybody liked about the Radio People and they kept meeting at these random book fests doing promotions. Reese liked her, but it didn\u2019t really go anywhere. Even after he got nicer, he was still kind of a dud. The section after that was all about the atemporals. The good ones were immortal and had super powers, but the bad ones had powers, too, so they had epic battles. The good ones, called Chronologues, were vegetarians. The other ones, the Ballastards, were meat eaters. This was one of the themes: Good vs. Evil and whether you eat animals (and people). Anyway, these atemporals have long histories and it took a lot of pages to talk about it all and I hate to say it, but it got to be boring. If Davies was trying to be like J. K. Rowling, it didn\u2019t work. The last section was set further in the future in a rural part of Ireland where Haley lived with two grandchildren. It\u2019s a terrible time because there was global warming, they ran out of oil, and the internet was down most of the time. This was another theme: we shouldn\u2019t ruin our planet by being greedy and negligent because young people don\u2019t deserve an apocalypse. At the end, do the good atemporals use some of their super powers to save the day? In the last section, that\u2019s what we wonder. If I wasn\u2019t already at the end of the page, I would have compared this messed up future world with Lord of the Flies . In summary, Davies uses many characters with some of them being supernatural to talk about important themes like good vs. evil and why we shouldn\u2019t rape the planet that young people will inherit. Actually, I had a few additional impressions that weren\u2019t covered by these two selections. \u00bb As a big fan of his past books, I\u2019m inclined to cut Davies some slack. He\u2019s such an exuberant storyteller that even the poor execution of the fantasy parts didn\u2019t spoil it for me entirely. Besides, if these body-dwelling entities were meant figuratively as the strong influences that live within us and help drive our attitudes, actions and morality, I can buy into that. \u00bb When Davies was a child, he spent hours constructing detailed maps and imaginative stories that no doubt comprised a grand vision. Fantasy was presumably a part of this. I guess I don\u2019t want to see that creative boyhood world threatened. \u00bb In interviews, Davies is said to view his collection of novels as one big \u00dcberbook. In fact, novels he has planned for the future also fit within this framework. I personally hope that his emphasis will be on the flesh and blood parts of this world. \u00bb What are we to make of the point Kaserman made about Davies and his writer-character, Reese? Do we view this whole meta- thing as fun self-awareness or as a now tiresome post-modern ploy to remind us again that all of fiction is just made up? For that matter, what would we say about a review that meta-riffs on the same conceit? 3.5/5 unfairly rounded down to 3 because Davies\u2019 bar is so high. ...more 4.5/5 stars I REALLY REALLY liked this book.

Some early paranormal experiences lead her to grasp beyond an ordinary life to find answers, and the answers she gets forces her by the end of the book to take sides in a war between immortals. That scope you need to know, as the late breakthrough into full-scale fantasy does not appeal to many readers. I take what the chef serves. And if it seemed a stretch to get invested with adequate suspense of disbelief, it was still a pleasure to play along. Hey, I lived fine with E.B. White\u2019s talking pig and Murakami\u2019s Colonel Sanders, so people whose souls can persist by passing from one body to another didn\u2019t spoil my pleasure. I think that, like in Gaiman\u2019s \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d, the absurdity of immortals in the mix of life on earth highlights by contrast the significance and meanings of being mortal. When first encountered in 1984, Holly is a typical rebellious teenager of 15 in a working class neighborhood in Kent, U.K., in 1984. She runs away from home to be with an older man and accidentally precipitates a family tragedy. Since childhood she has strange experiences which get labelled as hallucinations. Without knowing it, she has encounters over time with key people who prove to be enemies of each other. This antagonism reaches the level of a life-or-death conflict later in the book, where we return to Holly\u2019s perspective sixty years later. In between we get four more sections focusing on other characters at progressive intervals, with Holly more in the background but big in a reader\u2019s attention. I especially love the section titled \u201cCrispin Hershey's Lonely Planet 2015\u201d, which features famous lecherous novelist whose life is a mess. Maybe it\u2019s a bit self-indulgent for authors to write about writers, but to me the satirical outlook on the publishing enterprise and verve of this guy as he makes the rounds pushing his books from Columbia to Shanghai was lots of fun. As in \u201cCloud Atlas\u201d, the different sections of the book take on different writing styles, an experience I find exhilarating. Mitchell admits in interviews that his true avocation is to in creating novellas. If so, I don\u2019t perceive a cobbling from their integration into one novel-length story with these two books. I find it kind of cool that he considers all of his books in some sense as one gigantic work (an \u201cuber-novel\u201d). Fans work hard to map out all the characters which span different sets of his books. Mitchell claims to have planned much of the trajectory of his books. Readers of \u201cThe Thousand Autumns of Jacob Zoet\u201d may be surprised to learn that the Doctor Marinus in that late 18th century tale is the same immortal that turns up as a central character in \u201cThe Bone Clocks\u201d and that a final third Marinus-linked novel in planned. The book hit the spot for me as a delightful flight of fancy about semi-mythical missions with some take-home lessons for ordinary schmucks lucky enough to return from Oz to Kansas. I come away with the sense that our self-centered focus on the quotidian present can be transformed by a frame in which the past and future are meaningfully connected. Maybe there is a bigger story we can play a part in; if not, it goes beyond free will vs. fate if you can use your imagination to treat the whole deal of life as a mystery or a puzzle. If you hope an author will figure out the meaning of life, and he comes back with an absurdity like here, it really whets the humble consumer to reach with ambitions for some scheme closer to the truth. For more serious delvings into the wonders, themes, and disappointments of this book I can't recommend more highly the reviews of Ian and Cecily . ...more What a glorious mess, oh God. ------------------------- There are certain Indian sweets which will hook you on the first bite itself.

Before you know, you start gorging; soon, you feel nauseated as all the sugar goes to your head - yet you keep on eating as by that time you have become addicted. When you finish, you are left with a bloated tummy and a nagging headache - and a wish you had left well enough alone: yet the next time when the same dish is placed in front of you, you once again start gorging. I could say the same for David Mitchell's prose. ------------------------- Can an author become a prisoner of his own style? The so-called \"superstars\" in Indian movies climb to the top through their histrionic skills (mostly). Once they reach the pinnacle, however, they realise that the audience is coming to see them and not the film. They develop certain mannerisms and stylised ways of acting which they will employ, whatever be the character they are portraying: soon, they will get scriptwriters and directors to create characters which will magnify their on-screen persona. After a while, the on- and off- screen persona merge together, and the actor ends up imitating himself in front of the camera as well as elsewhere. This is the beginning of the fall. David Mitchell, who vowed readers with themes of the basic connectivity of human beings through two brilliant novels - Ghostwritten and Cloud Atlas - seems to have started imitating himself. Disconnected narratives through the POVs of different characters, written in different styles, spread out over time and space, yet having a central thread - in fact, all the \"trademarks\" of a Mitchell novel - are present here in the book under review. However, it will disappoint any serious reader approaching the novel, other than those who are here to see David Mitchell being himself. ------------------------- The text below contains what some may consider spoilers. \"The Bone Clocks\" is an out-and-out fantasy novel. Mitchell has dabbled with fantasy in both \"Ghostwritten\" and \"Cloud Atlas\"; here it is the mainstay. And according to me that is the major weakness of this story: the fantasy is too weak, most of the time seeming like a pale imitation of something that Stephen King or China Mi\u00e9ville would have done in much more depth. Holly Sykes, who starts off in the first part as a troubled and rebellious teenager on the run from a domineering (according to her, that is) mother and a failed romance, in 1984, rounds off the story in the sixth part as a seventy-year-old woman living in a bleak dystopia in 2043. In-between, we have narratives from other characters who enter her life in various guises. As the story progresses, the parallel fantasy universe which affects Holly and through her, the world, is revealed in more and more detail until the epic battle between the forces of good and evil (in true fantasy tradition) takes place in part five. On the positive side, the writing is excellent and the prose rich, in true David Mitchell tradition. The stories of the individuals as they move through time and space, intertwined with the vision of a world slowly unravelling (starting with Margaret Thatcher's neoliberalism, on through the Gulf War and the progressively deteriorating global situation) is extremely compelling. Negatives: the lukewarm fantasy with a rather predictable outcome, and the utter pointlessness of the whole narrative (IMHO, that is). Two stars - did not make it to three. ------------------------- (PS: I think I would be missing an important aspect of Mitchell's writing if I did not mention its meta-aspects. Like Stephen King, David's characters seem to be growing larger than the books they are contained in, and have seem to have acquired a sort of meta-life in his fictional universe (this is different from authors who create fictional worlds which feature in a number of unconnected books - like Isaac Asimov or P.G. Wodehouse , to take two disparate examples - or authors who create a series of books around the same theme or people). They stride across apparently unconnected plots. In Steve's case, it has become such an obsession that he himself has entered into that universe - will the same happen to Mitchell? One has to wait and see.) ...more Let's get the most important thing out of the way first: Jessica and Cynthia got a copy of this book for me at BEA, and David Mitchell signed it!!!

But look at how nice this looks all by its ARC self: (hide spoiler) ] I really liked The Bone Clocks , and it's so obviously the natural evolution of David Mitchell's style and work that it's a pleasure to read. In past books, Mitchell created a narrative where the characters were connected by space ( Ghostwritten ) and a narrative where they were connected by time ( Cloud Atlas ). The Bone Clocks takes all of these concepts -- time, space, the nature of reality -- and mixes them all together. And that includes the characters from Mitchell's previous works, too: Jason's sadistic older cousin from Black Swan Green is a narrator in The Bone Clocks , and Marinus from Jacob de Zoet appears with physicist Mo from Ghostwritten . Personally, I don't feel like The Bone Clocks is the place to start with Mitchell, because it's so rewarding to see these familiar faces show up in different guises. And I can't think too long about the appearance of Luisa Rey in the middle of the 2003 Iraq war, because isn't Luisa Rey ... well, never mind. If you've read Cloud Atlas , this is one of the parts of The Bone Clocks that will stick with you. From the very first page, Holly Sykes captivated me. David Mitchell writing about teens in the 80s is The Best: pitch-perfect, spot-on, etcetera. I could have read about Holly wandering the British coastline forever. She's the main character of the story, and the other narrative threads wind around hers. Each new narrator is well-written and interesting, another case of David Mitchell showing off exactly how great a writer he is; being in Hugo's brain might be unpleasant, but it's so well done that it doesn't matter. It would be a crime to explain the plot for anyone who hasn't read the book yet, but suffice it to say that this is a literary paranormal novel, one that reveals itself slowly and subtly. So, if I can't emote about David Mitchell enough, why four stars? For me, the book dragged in a few places, mostly when there was a switch to a new narrator. Some of the later elements aren't exactly explained or are too simplistic; perhaps I'll like them more on another read. But I think the real \"problem\" is that I'm one of the Mitchell fans whose favorite book is Black Swan Green . It's fun to see what Mitchell can do with time and space and the point of human existence, but ultimately I'm interested in Jason, Holly, and their life stories. I can appreciate and enjoy something like The Bone Clocks , but I love the heart and the self-contained narrative of Black Swan Green . I don't know if Mitchell has fully achieved what he tries to do with Ghostwritten , Cloud Atlas , and The Bone Clocks -- but I hope he keeps on going, because they get better each time.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more I once read, in a friend's review of Cloud Atlas , that David Mitchell is a writer who loves to show off.

Yet the novel is structured in a way that is completely anti-fantasy; like Mitchell deliberately wants to impede your understanding of his book. So when you frantically turn the pages to look for a glossary that is not there, you can almost hear him laugh at your desperation. The Bone Clocks is divided into six sections, narrated through the POVs of five characters. Holly Sykes, whose voice begins and ends the book, is the thread that binds together the other narratives. Almost 60 percent of the book focuses on fleshing out these characters by giving them detailed backstories, which are beautifully written and fairly enjoyable. There are subtle hints throughout about mysterious events, all involving Holly, that seem to be building up to a big supernatural reveal. But the reveal, when it does happen, is too late and too much. It's like you are unceremoniously tossed off a cliff and expected to keep yourself afloat. Mitchell throws a bunch of ludicrous, made-up, fantasy-speak at you, without providing enough context or taking enough time to make those terms comprehensible. So you have characters spouting dialogues like \"She is chakra-latent, so she may react badly to scansion and redact her own memories\" and \"I need to revoke my Act of Immunity, so we can merge our psychovoltage\" , and you just can't decide if this is unintentionally funny or deliberately silly. Although ingeniously plotted, The Bone Clocks ultimately disappoints because Mitchell seems more at ease at giving hints than fleshing out the facts. True, there is evidence here of Mitchell's genius, but not in the parts that are crucial to the plot. It seems to me that Mitchell's books are best read in the order they were published, since many characters reappear in his stories, so I might have erred by opting to read this book first. 2.5 ...more Here's the second DNF for this week (I checked these books out from the library so my motivation to finish them is maybe not the highest, with several other books waiting on the shelf).

I should point out that Mr. Wood doesn't listen to me, or ever answer, but I'm used to that, I'm married after all. In his review , James Wood makes much the same criticism as he made of The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet : entertaining, yes, great storytelling, yes, but he bemoans the lack of weight, the inner necessity, the profound examination of the human state. Mr. Wood, self-castigating Protestant, wants that which is good for his soul to be stodgy, painful and dull, sees writing as a zero-sum calculation, any novel that provides THAT much fun can't possibly be worthy and profound as well. Once again, I beg to differ. The weighty themes are there, but they are gossamer light on their feet. David Mitchell has called this his 'mid-life crisis novel' . Time is hurrying at his back, at all our backs: mid-life is when we realize we are not immortal, so if you want to see the world from the seat of a Moto Guzzi while earning a degree from the Open University, you'd better get on with it. Fear of ageing: \"You'd think old age was a criminal offence, not a destination we're all heading to\". Stop smoking, join a gym, have botox: to ward off the ravages of the ageing process, how far would you go? Would you cannibalise the younger generation, like those Anchorites? Of course not, but on another level, that is precisely what we are all doing, burning up this planet as if there were no tomorrow. Life is precious precisely because we only get one shot at it. This is no great deep insight, no, but wait, there's more, there's more. That weird stuff, the great Harry Potter style battle between Good and Evil, those Horologists - who are they? Well, it gets flagged up quite nicely, they talk of the Script, Horologists can move inside anyone's head, move around in space and see what is going in another scene, they love foreshadowing, they can use suasion to make those characters do what they want to serve the plot, oops sorry, the Script; they are writers , surely. Authors. Using their authority. Mr Wood makes the perfectly relevant point in his critique that their battle seems to have very little to do with the real world, it is an empty firework fantasy showcase, but a fight between these privileged beings that has almost zero effect on the rest of humanity. Well, yes. That's the point isn't it? Here are our prophets, our Cassandras, our scholars who carry the wisdom of generations within them, and who is listening to them? Should we listen to their petty infighting squabbles? Do men and women of letters still matter? Everyone is just staring at screens and tapping on devices. Where will they be when electricity runs out? At least I will still have my low-tech paper versions, read only in daylight, admittedly, but at least that will still work.

What I will share are what I felt to be the highlights and downfalls that brought me to my rating. First off, I think Mitchell is a genius...what an incredible mind to have created such an imaginative world with the most memorable characters. My two favorites that will stay with me are Marimus and Holly. I truly cared about what happened to these two and felt the author shined in character development. Secondly, I loved the whole concept of the story! It basically is the author's version of good versus evil, but on his terms. Where the book let me down was in its length...I'm not sure why the book was as long as it was! I found myself thinking 'okay, let's get to it' as there were many scenes that had too much backstory, or took on side stories that ultimately had little bearing on moving the story forward. Mitchell is the type of writer who provides upfront information that becomes more important once the story unfolds. This is why all the extra side stories drove me crazy as I wasn't sure what I should be focusing on. All said and done though, I'm really glad I read it...I found myself thinking about the book when regular life prevented me from being able to read. I think that's one of the nicest compliments you can give an author! ...more", "Title": "The Bone Clocks"},
