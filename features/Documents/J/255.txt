Then one day a poem was put in front of me that in one sentence changed my perception. \u00a0I was amazed. I was enthralled and I had a choice to make... Do I change my feeling regarding poetry. I hit university with a bang and English lit. Enter the ode of the Grecian Urn. That was that. I hated poetry. So short stories had a wee bit more merit. Not much. Then I read how much Stephen King loved it and now I am developing a taste for it. So is this book a book of poetry? \u00a0Yes and no. Is it a book of shorts no and yes. Hat is it. \u00a0It is like all such works a book for the voyeur. It gives insight into the demons that stands beside your bed when you need to go to sleep. Yes it is a voyeur 's dream. But what you will find is your own face in the mirror. It is this that I am now falling in love with. Not the image - the fact that somebody else can put into \u00a0words emotions I hardly even acknowledge let alone explore. Thus this book has a piece called\u00a0Self evaluation which is the one part of this book I could most closely identify with. I had a good chuckle at Letter To The Cute Blonde With The Ponytail, In The \u00a0Tie-Dyed Shirt. The Wreck Of It All is a deeply disturbing piece. Kitchen Table is a very true reflection of reality. So after it all, here is the amazing part. This book has no clear niche. It has no clear genre classification. It is an exploration and I implore you to take the journey. Guaranteed you'll find you!

'Letter to the cute blonde...' is one of the pieces that really hit a note with me, the imagination playing a part in what we think to believe about a stranger and how we read their behaviour. As fellow writer I identify with 'I Write' (because of the demons they exorcise and the sanity they allow) and my favourite line in the book comes from 'Imagine' (that someone knew you the way that only you do). Sharpe is letting us in a little into his world with these poems, or at least so it feels. Some of them rhyme - at least in parts, others don't. They don't tend to follow a metric rhythm but they have a distinct voice and one that engages and captivates you. They topics range from an early childhood experience to that of a twelve years old onto parenthood. What I found in these pieces is a thoughtful and deeply sensitive voice or soul,<---M> sometimes unsure of himself</---M>, romantic and clever, someone who refreshed my memory of feelings and sensations stuck and buried under my daily routines and numbness, a break that I thoroughly enjoyed. ...more<---C>Dennis Sharpe</---C>", "Title": "Fresh"},
