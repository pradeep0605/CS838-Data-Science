Read them and explore! Happy reading! :) ...more Simply awesome ! Why settle for only one when you can have all three. Having proof read and reviewed all three of Renee Paule\u2019s insightful and thought provoking books, the author has come up with the inventive idea of linking all three into one combined edition. This format will enable the reader to conveniently follow through Renee Paule\u2019s train of thought, whilst also providing a fiscal incentive to delve deeper into the narrative of these literary publications. A highly recommended book for people who wish to see what's really behind their veil. People who wish to change their lives for the better. I'm glad I've read all three of the books now assembled as a single book. These books have changed my perspective of life. All I can say is that I refer to the words of this book for every single thing that I do feel or think about.<---F> I loved reading them</---F>. Enjoyed reading every single page. I hope you do so too. Read all three of these books ... excellent! I have written what I wanted to say in the blurb of this book, as I am the editor. I feel it deserves a rating and is well worth reading. <---A>Ren\u00e9e Paule</---A> has worked her three previous books, which I had already read separately - On the Other Hand, Just Around the Bend and Louder Than a Whisper (<---B>also available separately</---B>) - into one volume and,<---M> as usual</---M>, has come up with the perfect title, '<+++>A Three Course Meal for the Mind</+++>.'

Ren\u00e9e's books come under the title of Self-Help, but rather than being in the usual run-of-the-mill vein of 'do this and you will feel better', her work leads you into truly examining yourself and your interaction with the 'outside' world by giving you questions to ponder. No answers are doled out within these pages, you have to find those for yourself. In what appears to be a time of chaos around the planet on more than one level, many people are 'waking up' to the realisation that any change for the better has to begin with each individual. Any, or all, of these books will take you on a voyage that can be uncomfortable but that will ultimately help you to discover and live as your true self. ...more Ren\u00e9e Paule's compilation of her first three books is an ideal way of getting to grips with the thought provoking content, plus also is a far more cost effective way of purchasing all three books. This is a must read and a bargain to boot.<---C>Ren\u00e9e Paule</---C>", "Title": "A Three Course Meal for the Mind"},
