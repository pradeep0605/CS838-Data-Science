My intention was to start small and end big, with the mysteries deepening and the stakes escalating with each book. Rather than front loading, I purposefully spread the world building and character development across the whole series so there is always something new to learn or discover until the final revelation which concludes the series in a very satisfying fashion. When picked up by Orbit (the fantasy imprint of big-five Hachette) they released the series as three, two-book omnibus editions which makes for an exceptional value since you get two books for the same price as most single books. I hope you'll enjoy these first two books in the series, and I'd love to hear what you think about them so please drop me a line at michael (dot) sullivan (dot) dc (at) gmail (dot) com.<---F> All feedback is welcomed</---F>. ...more Two words.

My review for each book within <+++>Theft of Swords</+++> will be combined since I don\u2019t want to make this review too long than it already is but before I start my review, I would like to say something that\u2019s been bothering me ever since before I start reading the book and that is the horrible cover to this omnibus. This omnibus has got to be kidding me with its cover, it\u2019s in my opinion that out of all the books I have, this is the number 1 worst book cover I have in my possession. The characters in the cover clearly don\u2019t match the description mentioned in the book and I\u2019m pretty sure it also doesn\u2019t match what\u2019s in the author\u2019s head. Hadrian is supposed to be BLOND, instead we get a black-hair shaved Christian Bale look-alike in the cover who can\u2019t stop staring at the reader. Royce looked like a drug cartel that was given a sword and suddenly transported to a middle of a war. Both of them stare at the reader as if it\u2019s our fault they\u2019re in the cover, look at it and see if I\u2019m wrong. God, make them stop, I can feel their stare even when I\u2019m typing this. I\u2019ll take the anime fan-art version of Royce & Hadrian compared to the one in this cover any day. In my opinion, Marc Simonetti should\u2019ve been the one who do the cover the art to Riyria Revelations, his artworks is perfect for high fantasy series and I\u2019m really glad he\u2019s the one doing Age of Myth and its sequel. I\u2019ll begin my review after showing these gorgeous arts of the two book inside this omnibus done by him. Crown Conspiracy Avempartha The plots within the first two books are mostly very simple and short. I find the plot of the 1st book a huge struggle to go through as it\u2019s super underwhelming. It\u2019s too simple, short and it doesn\u2019t even come close to the true definition of epic fantasy. I like to think that the first book served as a 300+ pages prologue rather than a complete installment. The 2nd book clearly improved in its plot line delivery and pacing, it's more like a true beginning to the main story itself that deals with The Heir of Novron. Think of the plot structure like a TV series, within each season there\u2019s always one main plot line but to reach there, there\u2019s a lot of stories and episodes to go through first. To make it even simpler, think of this series as one huge book divided into six entry. Even though this kind of structure doesn\u2019t work for me as an individual installments in books, it could still work as a series and I really can\u2019t wait to see how this all plays out in the end. Michael J Sullivan\u2019s writing is very simple and really easy to read. This make the story and world-building aspect of this book really easy to imagine, plus the fact that it borrowed a lot of tropes from classical fantasy make it so much easier to access for everyone. This could be seen as something positive or negative depending on what you\u2019re looking for, I\u2019m more in between on this aspect. The positive is I find Elan, the world which is reminiscent of LOTR very easy to imagine and dive into but at the same time, there isn\u2019t anything original here, not even the characters. One of the biggest problem I have with this book also lies within the writings. The narrative is done in a way that felt almost omniscient which means we never get to be inside the head of the POV characters. This made me feel very detached from all the characters, even Royce & Hadrian cause we never get to know their inner feelings and thoughts behind their actions, we only get to see them from an observant perspective. I always love when I could connect with the characters, know what's going on inside their heads, their feelings, truly understand them but sadly the narrative in this book drove me away from that enjoyment and this will take some time getting used to. Currently, I seriously still have no idea why everyone\u2019s raving about Royce & Hadrian being the best duo ever written, not only I\u2019ve seen these two character more than a hundred times already in the video games I played, them being the main characters certainly doesn\u2019t get enough spotlight in the first book. Sure they\u2019re almost in every scene but all their background are purposely withhold and all we get is the typical Royce, the reluctant \"supposedly badass\" hero who always ended up helping his partner Hadrian, a strong fighter with his goody two shoes personality. This make their characteristic really flat and cliche. I find the supposedly fun and funny banter between Royce & Hadrian to be so scarce and when it\u2019s there, it\u2019s not even interesting. Most of them always end up with Royce complaining about Hadrian\u2019s goody two-shoes personality. That's it. One of the most amusing dialogues for me happened literally in the first chapter of the first book, and that\u2019s between Hadrian and a bandit. \u201cHadrian shook his head and sighed. \u201cWhy do you have to make everything so difficult? They\u2019re probably not bad people\u2014just poor. You know, taking what they need to buy a loaf of bread to feed their family. Can you begrudge them that? Winter is coming and times are hard.\u201d He nodded his head in the direction of the thieves. \u201cRight?\u201d \u201cI ain\u2019t got no family,\u201d flat-nose replied. \u201cI spend most of my coin on drink.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not helping,\u201d Hadrian said.\u201d For all the talk about them being some kind of legend, we only get to know about their deeds in the past, we never truly see it in actions in the current story except for Hadrian. This case holds true especially for Royce, all he did in the first two books is literally all talk and open doors, he didn\u2019t even get to use his knife to fight his enemy, probably once or twice but again, we didn\u2019t get to really see it. This make it seems like I should read the prequels first before starting this series. The withholding of information on their background doesn\u2019t help either, I predicted Royce\u2019s background ever since the beginning of the first book where it\u2019s shown he can see in the dark and the first encounter with a (view spoiler) [elf slave (hide spoiler) ] , only to be proven right at the end of book two. This makes the withhold of information completely useless to me since it doesn\u2019t even hold a surprising or mysterious factor. I have no idea why the first book focused on Alric so much, at one moment I thought he was the main character but then he appeared in literally only one chapter in Avempartha. What\u2019s up with that\u2026?? I have huge praises for two of the side characters in this series, Myron & Esrahaddon, without these two I probably would have struggled so much more in finishing these books. There are a lot of character development potential for Myron and I really can\u2019t wait to see more of him in the future, it\u2019s a shame though he didn\u2019t have any role in book 2. As for Esrahaddon, the manipulative version of Gandalf, there\u2019s an abundant amount of interesting mystery to this character and this is the only part where the withholding of information worked in these books for me. Even with all these negatives and points that don\u2019t work for me, most of them lie within the first book. The second book improved on almost every aspect, especially in its world-building and overarching main plot line. Royce & Hadrian have a lot of spotlight, the side characters are interesting and there are more actions this time, the politics and foreshadowing for the greater plotline are also all there which make come to the conclusion, Riyria Revelations is a series that improve with each installment. Again I must state, all my reviews above are my personal experience and observation of this installments , not the series as a whole. I\u2019m not discontinuing this series or Michael J Sullivan\u2019s works, as a matter of fact, I\u2019m more intrigued to continue now. The way I see it, Michael created each installment clearly with the conclusion of the whole series in mind. As I mentioned in the beginning of my review, think of this series as 1 huge book divided into 6 part, this means that it will only get better from here as you can see from my ratings for each book. With the next installment, more withhold information and backgrounds are unraveled, right now, it seems like everything will lead towards and be resolved in the final books which I personally don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s a risky thing to do and in my opinion it doesn\u2019t work as an individual installments but it\u2019s something that would definitely work as a series. If I have to choose, I prefer a series that begin with a rough beginning but end it with a bang rather than the other way and I hope Riyria Revelations will not disappoint me on its conclusion.

Said bandits are a little confused at the relaxed manner of the Riyria men. But . . . once they find out who Hadrian and Royce are, they are beside themselves trying to get things cleared out for them to pass on their way with no trouble. Oh, to have written that whole part of the book in my review of this first book. \u263a So this jerk sets up Hadrian and Royce into stealing a sword from the king. They said it was all easy since said jerk had already moved the sword to a hidden place. I mean come on, who would fall for that AND they didn't want to do something short notice. They like to plan for a bit, but they did it anyway and all hell breaks loose! Anyhoo, so they scale the castle, get in and look for the sword and lo and behold, the king has been stabbed and the men are trapped and then of course framed. Note: There is a little b\u2022stard of a dwarf that needs to get his! Moving on, so Royce and Hadrian are in the dungeons to be tortured and killed. fjsdgadoghadoigaoihgaiodfdioshgaiga <--- that was me cussing! But the sweet princess, Arista saves them, sets them free and tells them they have to kidnap her brother, Alric, who put them in the dungeons to be killed to begin with. It's all cray but I love it. So they drag Alric off and finally tell him all that is going on. Of course Alric is very angry thinking someone killed his father and wants to kill him and is worried for his sister. But Alric's sister wanted him to go to a secret prison and see a wizard there named Esrahaddon. But lets backtrack for a minute. Along the way they stop at an abbey but they find out it has been burned to the ground and the monk, Myron is there all alone trying to rebuild the library by re-writing all of the books. I fell right in love with Myron. He is sweet and funny and omg he has never left the abbey since he was four-years-old. He had never pet or ridden a horse, never seen a woman, never seen anything. Period. They talked Myron into going with them and the new king, Alric said he would give him a job. Poor Myron didn't want to go, he was scared but they finally talked him into it. And he was amazed at the world outside. It was so sweet. Now back to the prison. Royce finally figures out how to get into the hidden prison, they meet Esrahaddon who is 900 ish years old. Against their better judgement they set him free. And now I wonder what he is going to end up doing to the world when we get back around to him. After all of this, the gang head over to see Count Pickering and tell him what all happened. The count says he will side with the new king, Alric and starts gathering his forces. But they get word that Alric's sister is going to be put to death for treason and is being called a witch. I mean she did learn some stuff from Esrahaddon but so far she's a good person and it's the evil uncle that wants them all dead so he can rule. Jerk! Count Pickering's peeps aren't all going to get there in time so Alric sends Royce and Hadrian ahead to save Arista (which they do) ha, it's so awesome and funny. Let's just say some peeps are beheaded and things are set right (for now) Oh and they leave a little message on the wall of a jerk that was going to side with the evil uncle. Book 2 - Avempartha Holy sh\u2022t balls! I loved this freaking book! Okay, so it's like a couple of years later . . . if I read that right. Hadrian and Royce are out to seek revenge on the man that almost got them killed, but circumstances changed that and they end up following a girl (Thrace) back to her home in Dahlgren. She's afraid for her father because a creature - that turns out to be a Gilarabrywn - is killing everyone in their little town. Some of Thrace's other family members have been killed and she can't get her father to leave. In this book we only have Alric in the beginning of the book when he makes Arista the Ambassador of Melengar. She has to go and deal with some jerks. And the old Bishop Saldur who is a snake and was for their uncle in the first story, is still in the second book being a jerk. Oh, I hope someday he gets his! And, Magnus the dwarf that I thought very badly of in the first book, he made up for it in this second book. I fell in love with him. And I love the banter between him and Royce! We find out some revelations about Royce! YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS! I knew it too! I'm not saying a word, just yeah, I'm looking forward to some cool things going on in the next books. And we find out a few more things about Hadrian. OMG, I love them both! I can't help it. The wizard, Esrahaddon, who now goes by, Esra Haddon, is in the same little town. I actually like him a lot, unless he does something bad in the next books. I never did mention that he had his hands cut off a billion hundred years ago! He's still got some mojo though. And don't you love the play on his name :-D At one point, Arista ends up at this little town too. They are all up in a castle above it and are having some games on who can defeat the Gilarabrywn. And of course there is some dumb set up with the evil peeps. Oh and some of the Pickering boys are back and I just love them. Mauvin is my favorite. I keep hoping something will happen with him and Arista but she just sees him as a brother. Royce, Esra, Hadrian and even ole Magnus are trying to get into the tower to get this sword because it's the only way to kill the Gilarabrywn. Well, all kinds of things go right and wrong there. Some people die that I wish didn't die. I cried during some parts, for sadness and for the awesomeness. And me thinks there be elves in those woods . . . I love this book, Theft of Swords! I love the characters, even the evil ones are written perfectly. I love the world, I love every little thing!!!!! Accept I want Millie to come back, for those of you that know who Millie is. . . I look forward to continuing on in this world. \u2665 . . .

So first thing I noticed after purchasing theft of swords, was the hideous cover.. Yuck! I hate it. Seriously the description in the book of what Royce & Hadrian look like is nothing like the cover, for one Hadrian is a gorgeous blondie, why for the love of God does he look like a bald cretin on the cover? Seriously the cover did leave a sour taste in my mouth. Apart from the ugly cover i also hated the name of the book, \"Theft of Swords\" its just so un creative and blah. So basically in this one book you get two different stories \"The Crown Conspiracy\" & \"Avempartha\" which ironically are both much better names then the actual title that was chosen. Anyway I didn't hate reading this book it was well written and had a good plot, it just had so many issues, like for one the strange POV that it is told in. My friend Petrik said it is omniscient third person POV. Okay don't get me wrong i did end up getting used to the POV it just struck me as strange and annoying. It was seriously like reading a script for a movie, there was 0 emotion. But what I hated most about this POV is it prevented me from having insta-love for the characters, I didn't no what they were thinking or feeling, so it felt cold to me and I can't possibly love characters if I can't dissect their mind. In my personal opinion the main characters were kinda lame in the beginning I just didn't understand the bromance, they spoke a lot about things that happened in the past to give them a badass reputation, like hello am I missing something? Seriously where even was the bromance or badassery? Also don't do what I did and start your Riyeria journey with Theft of Sword, I suggest reading the prequel first, so you actually understand the bromance. In the plot there was 0 action, I'm blood thirsty and there's no blood. Like I literally didn't see any badassery from either of the two Main Characters in The Crown Conspiracy or any good proper fights in either book *snorts* boring , I feel book two did pick up the pace and was more interesting but it was still just cliche and abit boring. I was patiently waiting through a whole book to be wowed and I wasn't once. Yep not once.. Differently not a favorite. And to be honest I couldn't give a shit about the 'bromance', I didn't really get their 'inside' jokes either. It is nowhere near as good as Wax and Wayne (Mistborn era 2) bromance for me. But it was a good book, I did smile while reading it and loved two of the background characters. The idea of two unlikely heroes saving the day, a thief and a trained killer, was one of my favorite aspects of the story. The Crown Conspiracy didn't interest me until the last few chapters and I got a taste of some action (finally), also it was pretty much focused on Alric and I did not like Alric. The plot was about Hadrian and Royce being framed for the Kings murder then escaping and kidnapping Alric the heir to the throne and they go on an adventure. Sounds awesome but my personal opinion is it was pretty boring. So to my surprise I liked Avempartha, I literally had so much fun reading it, the banter improved in the story aswell as plot pacing. It had a very typical fantasy plot with a monster and a extremely cliche ending, but it was hilarious. The handless wizard made me laugh, 'If this hast been done to language, I fear to know the fate of all else.' Royce really grew on me, I loved finding out about his past! He is so cool and smart. I love how he is always grumpy one of my favorite parts \u201cI hate dwarves.\u201d Arista was a favorite from the start, I love strong females. I also did start to like Hadrian he is just abit soft for my liking, honestly for a big badass mercenary with a killer past, he was pretty boring. I just wanted him to bash someone and prove how good he was with weapons like his reputation says, sad to say it folks, there was no badassery from this guy. The only part I really enjoyed was when he was teaching weapons to a certain someone. I did however find Hadrian to be quite funny at times and I can relate to being pretty dopey and accident prone, one of my favorite parts, \"You might want to clear it some. A single stone can ruin a night\u2019s sleep. I ought to know; it seems whenever I sleep outside, I always end up with a stone under the small of my back.\u201d This is me also and this is why I hate camping. Time to talk about my favorites, Myron, seriously I LOVE HIM. He was so funny, i swear I only continued reading book one because of him and the things he would say. So basically Myron is a forgotten child who was sent to a monastery. He hasn't ever really been outside, cries over burnt books (totally relatable If there was a house fire here I would grab my son and my books.) he has also never seen a horse or a woman before. So as you can imagine he was an interesting travel partner. One of my favorite parts, \"This is a beautiful place,\u201d Myron declared, his eyes darting about the room. \u201cThere is so much going on, so many conversations. Speaking at meals wasn\u2019t allowed at the abbey, so it was always deathly silent. Of course, we got around that rule by using sign language. It used to drive the abbot crazy because we were supposed to be focusing on Maribor, but there are times when you but there are times when you simply have to ask someone to pass the salt.\u201d He is talking about a pub lol. I will continue reading this series as I'm interested in seeing how it will progresses. I have been told the books improve with each one so I'm excited to find out. I recommend this to people who are not looking for a blood bath and instead would prefer a nice fantasy read with a HEA ending. Also there is no swearing and basically no violence, this could be a great introduction into Fantasy for younger readers (15+). If these were two separate books I would have rated as follows; The Crown Conspiracy - 3/5 Avempartha - 4/5 ...more Theft of Swords is a compilation of two books, The Crown Conspiracy and Avempartha . In both of the novels the heroes, Hadrian and Royce, were hired to steal a sword, which causes a downward effect of dangerous adventures. *Slow clap* These two novels ended my year on such a high, that I am grateful for Mr. Sullivan's work.

I am so glad I didn't find the books I was in search for at Barnes and Nobles, and instead bought this one. The novels were fast paced, adventurous stories, that hooked me in from the first chapter in The Crown Conspiracy . At times I stopped breathing during the most intense moments. I liked how Mr. Sullivan kept the sword fight to a minimum, because it really made the fighting scenes amazing. They were also at the level of perfect detail to imagine the whole scene without really thinking too hard. Scenes just seemed to wonderfully flow. YES, some of the names are so hard to pronounce that I made simpler names, or called people by their occupation. Good thing there is a glossary. The characters were awesome. Not simply, because they have cool skills, like Hadrian with his swords, or Royce with his stealth, but of comedic interactions with one another. Hadrian and Royce couldn't be more opposite in personality. Royce with I hate everyone demeanor and Hadrian wanting to save everyone, but they have a great relationship that keeps them alive. They could be so sarcastic to one another that I couldn't help but laugh. I laughed a lot between the two novels because of the sassy remarks of Royce, and Esrahaddon (the wizard), or even Alric (the king) who was full of himself. My favorite character, even though the main ones were outstanding, was Myron. He was so innocent. I wanted to coddle him and keep him safe in my pocket. He said some adorable things, which just made me chuckle and made him ten times cuter. He was so afraid for the horses. I was a little upset that Myron wasn't in Avempartha . I really hope to see him in the next novel. He is the best. EVERYONE MUST LOVE HIM! The last thing I want to mention that there is a clouded mystery. Sullivan did an impeccable job keeping that mystery just out of reach of your finger tips, and leaves you guessing.

It's also somewhat the story of an independently published author turned major publishing success as is nicely explained here by Iceberg Ink. I have to first confess that this is exactly the type of story I love, so pardon my overlooking of any of the faults.

It deals with good Theft of Swords is an omnibus of the first two books in the Riyria Reveleations, The Crown Conspiracy and Avempartha. It's also somewhat the story of an independently published author turned major publishing success as is nicely explained here by Iceberg Ink. I have to first confess that this is exactly the type of story I love, so pardon my overlooking of any of the faults. The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Theft of Swords is that it's \"traditional\" fantasy. It deals with good guys versus bad guys, questing, and there are even elves, dwarves, and a wise wizard. But when I really think about it, \"traditional\" doesn't quite explain it, or really even get close. Traditional, at least recently (I realize the irony), has come to mean Farmer boy becomes king or even a bloated and long-winded series that will never end. In that sense, Theft of Swords is anything but \"traditional.\" Even the elves aren't your typical elves, they're considered to be the lowest of the low, slaves even in some parts of this world called Elan. And then again, is it really good versus evil? We're dealing with a couple of thieves as the protagonists, each of whom has killed their fair share. Then, there's the fact that this is fantasy without all the bloat. Sullivan fills you in as we go without getting bogged down in describing every last thing. The story moves forward and you can't help but get sucked into the narrative. And I haven't even begun to talk about the characters. Royce and Hadrian. They're a mysterious duo who are much more than they seem and who make up the inexplicable group known as Riyria. The Crown Conspiracy begins with the duo steeling an incriminating letter back from the person they were paid to steel it for in the first place. Of course, they're not always scoundrels and end up doing the right thing at least most of the time. Add to that their amusing banter and even mockery, they're really hard not to love. Now that I've sung it's praises a bit, I'll break this omnibus down into the two stories that it contains, starting with a portion of my review (from almost 2 years ago) of The Crown Conspiracy: The Crown Conspiracy There is much to be said about a novel that reads well. I've mentioned this before on my own blog, but a book that keeps you reading ranks high for me. Not only is it entertaining, but you look forward to getting back into the book each and every time you pick it up, if you have the self-control to ever put it down. Atypical of many current series, The Crown Conspiracy does not contain much in the way of grittiness, yet it remains inventive. With twists and turns, you won't know who to believe. The plot moved quickly and even though some traditional fantasy archetypes show up, it is not in the usual way; including a wizard who provides little in the way of guidance as well as elves that are despised. This is not your typical epic as has already been mentioned especially when looking at the size of the novels and yet Sullivan is able to make the characters come alive. The relationship between Royce, the thief, and Hadrian, the brawn, is great fun and still provides great mystery. Who are these people and how do they have such talents? In terms of world-building, there is not an enormous amount, but I thought it fit the story very well. The reader is filled in by characters mostly through dialogue while the plot continues to move forward. Avempartha While I heartily enjoyed The Crown Conspiracy, Avempartha was even harder to put down. Here, we have an ancient monster, we find out more about our \"heroes,\" and get a better grasp on the history of the elves and the world of Elan. The narrative starts to expand and we're let in on some BIG things that are yet to come. The story is continued about a year after The Crown Conspiracy and Royce and Hadrian are called in to help a village that has been ravaged by a monster that has taken residence in the area. At this same time, the church of Nyphron has been setting its own plan in motion, calling for a secret competition, of which no one even knows the location. With all the mystery and suspense, there was not a point of view I wasn't dying to read, I'm not joking when I say I couldn't put it down. I did wish, however, that there was more told about the competition, as if we had an inside man competing, but it was understandable with where the author was taking us in the end. Why Read Theft of Swords? Theft of Swords is exactly what it purports to be. It's light-hearted fun and it will have you reading your eyes out. The characters, especially Hadrian and Royce, will have you coming back for more. 4 out of 5 Stars ...more This is a brilliant piece of storytelling that any fantasy or action/adventure lover should go and read this.

However before I divulge more information in that manner I would like to raise a few points. My first point being about fantasy in general while my second point will be about clich\u00e9 and storytelling. Fantasy as a genre in many ways was formed with The Lord of the Rings and then shortly afterwards, as much as people dismiss it, The Sword of Shannara . Subsequent books appeared such as The Wheel of time series by Robert Jordan which added to the sense of epic adventure and mythology fantasy was associated with. However in recent times, it seems as an attempt to escape the overworking of ideas and becoming too stereotypical as works such as Eragon most certainly are that fantasy has decided to go in dark directions. We therefore have the rise of gritty realism such as in A Game of Thrones or the weird fantasy as in Kraken . Some authors do manage to pull off these new gritty and bizarre forms of fantasy for me. For instance I find Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere a fine combination of the gritty and weird but then Gaiman's work is more urban fairytale than epic fantasy. It appears to me that the movement towards gritty fantasy is due mainly to do with the sense that there are few good original stories in fantasy any-more. The sense that in writing the heroic traditional sword and sorcery epics the writer drifts into clich\u00e9 and as such could not possibly write anything worth reading. Yet then why is it that writers such as Brandon Sanderson can continue tradition with Mistborn: The Final Empire and The Way of Kings ? Why can Patrick Rothfuss break into the market to great critical acclaim with a work in the traditional sense? And the same question could be asked of Blake Charlton and his work. I believe that we as readers need stories where the heroes are heroic, despite possibly facing struggles within themselves, and that we need villains who with all their melodrama are indescribably evil. As such Theft of Swords delivers precisely what I believe fantasy readers need. Theft of Swords is essentially two books containing two separate stories. I believe the author described his vision as akin to a reading version of tv show episodes. And that is certainly witnessed here. Michael J. Sullivan creates two separate yet overlapping stories that leave the reader wanting more after they are done. I certainly feel led to drop what I'm currently reading and move straight onto the second and third books. For those who would like a brief synopsis Theft of Swords (I love the resonance of that title) follows two thieves as they attempt (within two stories) to steal two separate swords. Of course our thieves are more than black hearted scoundrels. They are real heroic types who appear to be misunderstood by their medieval society. The reader discovers that their world is one suffering from the collapse of an old empire thousands of years ago and one in which the major religion worships the emperor Novron. There are plenty of twists (which while detectable are still entertaining), lots of fun banter between the protagonists, several other interesting side characters and several mysteries all of which is tied together with fast paced quality writing. If you're looking for entertainment then this is definitely a place to begin. There is over 600 pages in this volume but if you have the time to just sit and read time will fly as you become intrigued by who the two thieves are within a world of elves, dwarves and men that parallels other fantasy and yet is its own creation. The closest work it reminded me of in tone is another I rather love written for Young Adults and yet equally accessible for adults in The Ranger's Apprentice series which begins with The Ruins of Gorlan . This is a work of fiction no one should miss reading if they are looking for a fun entertaining read. Particularly on a wet winter's day (or on a sunny summer's day under the shade of a tree with a snack or two). If you're looking for a work lacking in clich\u00e9 then I must say that you might have a bone to pick with this. But I believe the author's job is not to be completely original (for is there such a thing as true originality?) here but rather to tell a powerful story. For I believe that the true future for the fantasy genre lies not in becoming darker but rather by taking old heroic tales and telling them better. What good is a dark and gritty adventure when in the end it lacks substance to its story? Good storytelling must always come first and that is what Theft of Swords is: powerful and natural storytelling. ...more Great book!

This book was originally two smaller volumes that was combined into one, and I'm not quite sure that combining them was really the proper way to go about it. Do they really fit together all that well? Sure, in terms of characters, but not really in terms of flowing story. Years pass between the books and the individual adventures are pretty much complete unto themselves. Still, it may not matter that much. Both are an enjoyable romp, even if it's pretty traditional Sword and Sorcery. So what are the real differences, as opposed to the many, many similarities to the rest of the Traditional Fantasy Adventure? Mostly it's in the elves, superior to humans and also the great losers in a long lost war. Our main surprises revolve around them, too, whether in long-plot or characters, so hold your horses. Or not. There really are too few horses in this Fantasy, and that's a feature, not a bug. :) This is not gritty and definitely not grimdark, which I happen to think is a good thing. The focus is on the story and the characters and in securing life, limb, and kingdom. :) The writing is clear and easy. I'm more than willing to continue on with this series to see where it heads. ...more *********** Full review finally posted! *************** Buddy read with Sarah and Petrik Riyria is without a doubt one of my favorite series!

So unsurprisingly, when two of my besties decided to give it a try, I couldn't resist and I jumped at the chance to re-read it! My rating hasn't changed since my first read and it's still somewhere between 3.5 and 4 stars (rounded up because I absolutely love the series as a whole and might be a tiny bit biased) I think I can safely say that Riyria is definitely the kind of series that gets better with each book!! I thought that the first time I read it and I completely agree with my younger self on that!! Sooo, Theft of Swords is divided into 2 books: The Crown Conspiracy and Avempartha. The Crown Conspiracy may be seen as a long prologue that lays the foundation to the main story. The landscape is defined and the main political and religious powers are introduced. Nevertheless, the story is quite simple and unlike most high Fantasy series I read, there is no big villain to overthrow, no impending doom that threatens the realms (yet ?). Even if that's kinda refreshing, my biggest complaint about this first part is that it totally lacked the complexity and epic tropes I usually seek in Fantasy! Yes, there is magic and a fabled wizard, yes there is talk about gods and an epic fallen empire, about elves and dwarves... But it's just that : talk and myths and History . The first time I read this, I just closed the book and was like \"Okay... Hum... shall I continue?\" And man ! I'm so glad I did! Because, though lacking \"epicness\" (well I know it's not a real word, but it should be!!), this book (and the series as a whole) introduced me to an awesome palette of great and lovable characters ! Hadrian and Royce form an improbable duo. They are fundamentally different, both carry mysterious pasts and they can't stop bantering ! I loved them since the beginning (even when we didn't know much) because I sensed there was much more to them than what Michael hinted at this point. And then there is dear, dear Myron, one of the most adorable and endearing characters ever written in Fantasy! He was so cute, marveling at everything and raving alone with no one to comment at his observations! XD \u201cThere,\u201d Hadrian told Royce, \u201cwe\u2019ve got Maribor on our side. Now you can relax.\u201d \u201cActually,\u201d Myron said sheepishly, \u201cI was praying for the horses. But I will pray for you as well,\u201d he added hastily. Source: http://minwind.deviantart.com/art/Riy... Something I also loved about this read too was Michael's prose and humor . The writing was really fluid and I enjoyed the easy read and laughed so hard at some of the dialogues and situations. The second book, Avempartha improved a lot in terms of plot and characterization imo! In this part, myths are taking more shape and the scope of the story is broadened , as more is at stake and interesting Fantasy elements are introduced ! We get to know more about Hadrian and Royce as they encounter new faces (Thrace is such a great female addition!!) and meet again with some of the first book's characters. I understand Petrik and Sarah 's complaints though as the story and actions are quite soft at this point and we hear a lot about the lead duo's badassery (in the past) but don't see much of it, for now ! ;-) Anyway, this second book was more engaging and hinted at a grander and more complex story and I was really happy to see more facets of Royce in this one! While Hadrian is genuinely kindhearted and caring and looking for a noble purpose in life (imagine him like a giant teddy bear ! Well a teddy bear carrying 3 swords, that is!), Royce is sinister, somber, grumpy, clever and sarcastic and I absolutely love the contrast between the two partners ! Source: http://federicomusetti.deviantart.com... Conclusion Theft of swords can be seen as a big introduction to the series. The plot is very simple and the characters are well outlined but lack depth, background and introspection at this point. I know this first book can be disappointing (I wasn't completely thrilled at first, even if I overall enjoyed the read) but if I may give an advice: please carry on with the whole series ! Because only at the last page of the last book will you see the whole big picture and all the elements of the puzzle will fall into place! And believe me, it will be worth the journey ! :D ...more Full review now posted!

When I first read The Name of the Wind a few years ago, I just knew that Patrick Rothfuss would be my favorite fantasy author for the rest of my life. I\u2019m a loyalist; once I hitch my little fan wagon onto a fandom train, I\u2019m there until the end of the line. Even if the quality goes down, even if plot twists in a way that I hate, even if I have to wait years and years between installments, my mama didn\u2019t raise no quitter. And I\u2019m definitely not quitting the Kingkiller Chronicles. But I have to confess that Rothfuss has been usurped as king of my fantasy-loving heart by Brandon Sanderson, whose creativity and work ethic knows no bounds. Once the throne was taken from him, I felt sure that Rothfuss would at least remain the prince regent, but alas. Now that I\u2019ve found Michael J. Sullivan, my former favorite may have been relegated to the wings. Did Sullivan use words as paint on the canvas of his pages to craft sentences so lovely they made me want to weep? No, he is not Rothfuss. Did he build a world and a magic system so real I suspect I could step inside the book, followed by plot twists that stop my heart and make me scream in shock? No, he is not Sanderson. But that\u2019s what is so refreshing about Sullivan; he\u2019s not trying to be anyone but himself. He\u2019s not trying to reinvent the wheel. If anything, he tries to pack as many fantasy tropes as he can into his novels. He\u2019s not trying to do anything new for the genre. What he is trying to do, and what he is succeeding at, is put out something fun and lighthearted in the midst of an overabundance of grim-dark entries into the genre, and he manages to do so without coming across as cheesy in any way. Theft of Swords was so much fun! Hadrian and Royce had great chemistry. The partners were thieves for hire, with Hadrian serving as the muscle and Royce as the sticky fingers. Usually when partners are the main characters of a story, I have a favorite. But I couldn\u2019t choose between Hadrian and Royce. They\u2019re both snarky and sassy and good men against their better judgment. There are host of fun side characters as well, my favorites of whom are Ersahaddon, Magnus, and especially Myron; none of whom I want to say much about because I don\u2019t want to give anything away. Besides the wonderful characters and sassy dialogue, Sullivan also managed to add a lot of mystery into a fun romp of a fantasy, which I thought was pretty different. He managed to write a really engrossing fantasy in easy to read, everyday English. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy, and especially to those who sometimes have a hard time focusing on a book. Lack of focus won\u2019t be a problem here, for sure. I can\u2019t wait to read the rest of the series, and everything else Sullivan puts out! ...more I saw some fangirling/fanboying reviews on GR for this series and I always wondered what was the fuss about.

I went into this book expecting to be blown away or wowed at least. IDK I wasn't, at least not at first and not completely. Yes, it is engaging in plot, yes, it has fab action scenes, yes it has interesting magic. I think it\u2019s a funny and enjoyable read. I laughed out loud for more than a couple of times. But there were some parts where I felt unhooked. Mainly because of the characters and some dejavu. I\u2019ve read a couple of books about elven, dwarves, two thieves BFFs, magical enchanted objects, things. Maybe that\u2019s the problem, I unintentionally started comparing this book to The Lies of Locke Lamora , The Lord of the Rings and even The Last Wish . So it ended up like smth I\u2019ve read earlier, but not really the same. \"Theft of Swords\" contains two books in one. The first book (\"The Crown Conspiracy\") had some issues that disappointed me, but this must be the type of series that gets better as you read further. I finished the first book (the ending was great!) and to tell the truth, I considered to dive into some other read more because, while I totally loved the story and the two main characters were likable (Hadrian and Royce. They're witty, they're extremely skilled in their field, and they're very good at getting into problems, also solving them.), I found that some felt a bit underdeveloped, not entirely believable (I mean the princess and the Bambi-eyed monk). But as I said earlier it was for the first little bit. The princess got considerably better as a character, gained some flesh to her personality and I ended up quite enjoying her after finishing the second book. That can\u2019t be said about the Bambi-eyed monk. He was cute, his funny dialogues made me smile, but it wasn\u2019t enough for me. But you know me, I'm a character fan, so I needed more. The second book (\"Avempartha\") was faster, also funny, had more yummy fighting, and even a monster (*sends love to Fluffster, I\u2019ll miss you :(*). Lol, I planned to grunt and banter that not many people died (yup, Mr. Erikson has spoiled me for long! ) but the second book solved that well. Also I must give credit for the unexpected endings. Thank you Mr. Sullivan for that. It's a funny and light read, but it was not quite a book which makes me squeal with joy. Despite that, I think that Mr. Sullivan is a really skilled writer with great potential. I\u2019ll continue with the series as everything got not worse, but better while reading further and I want to know what Royce and Hadrian will make out of it. :) ...more TODAY ONLY (10/14/16) -- Theft of Swords (Riyria Revelations #1 & #2) is $2.99 as part of Amazon's Daily Deal.

However, as I sat there debating Originally reviewed at Bookwraiths Reviews Theft of Swords was a novel I was tentative about beginning. Not because I did not want to sample this series, which I had read and heard so much about from its numerous followers on Goodreads, but for the simple reason that I have grown to like Mr. Sullivan a great deal since joining Goodreads: I\u2019ve been his \u201cfriend\u201d in the GR sense for many months, followed his reviews/blogs, and enjoyed his comments in numerous groups. However, as I sat there debating the wisdom of opening the novel on my e-reader, it was this admiration which made me hesitate and fear that I might not appreciate his book. But like many things which I have worried with unnecessarily, my hesitance was an absolute waste, because Theft of Swords was an excellent fantasy novel. Now, I want to go ahead and make clear that this book is a straightforward fantasy romp. It isn\u2019t a dark and brooding piece of realistic fantasy like so many other novels these days. It isn\u2019t a social commentary on our time, cleverly hidden in a fantasy setting of elves and dwarves. Nor is it a work of literary experimentation where the prose leaves one contemplating the brilliance of the one who penned it. No, Mr. Sullivan has written a novel which is all about storytelling at its finest; the grandeur of the book lying in the very fact that the writing style, the language, and the Tolkienesque setting all disappear in the sheer enjoyment of the two main characters. As most know, this dynamic duo of fantasy consists of Hadrian Blackwater and Royce Melborn: the former an elite but na\u00efve swordsman, the later a deadly but cynical assassin. These guys making up \"Riyria,\" which is the finest, most sought after group of thieves in the kingdom. If you need a job done, then all you need do is make contact with their \"agent\" Viscount Albert; gold will exchange hands, and the deed shall be done. While that simplistic thief-type story might turn many sophisticated fantasy readers off, I'd suggest you reappraise your snap judgment, mainly because Hadrian and Royce have one of the wittiest, most realistic partner relationships in the genre. They clash frequently. They argue almost incessantly. Their philosophical points of view on the human condition could not be more adverse to one another. Yet somehow, they are also the best of friends; each willing to brave utmost danger or death to save the others ass when necessary. And this great camaraderie drives this tale. But, also, this is a narrative which begins very simply as a thief style tale, then gradually grows in complexity into a true epic fantasy. There are numerous twists and turns along the way, and even when \u201cthe way\u201d seems familiar, you can't become complacent, because things are never exactly what you think they are. Mr. Sullivan constantly hiding \"easter eggs\" in the narrative, leading you forward toward a destination that always stays just hidden out of sight. Yes, Theft of Swords was an entertaining tale that I wish I'd read sooner. It delivers on so many levels, but the most important one to me personally was that it was fun. Not blood and gore fun or deeply philosophical fun, though I do appreciate those types of stories as well, but fun as in \" God, that was a really fun book to read. I can't wait to read the next one. \" So, if you\u2019ve been thinking of trying Theft of Swords , go ahead and just do it.

Esrahaddon is by far the most mysterious of all of them. He lived for 900 years in a prison out of time, if you pass my saying so. So much mystery around him, his abilities, his history. He is also a great character.

Michael J Sullivan has the possibility of becoming one of my favorite fantasy authors. This book had some of the things I really love in a story BROMANCE I totally enjoy a good pairing of friends that play of one another and are so different but work so well together like Tyrian and Brom (Game of Thrones), Waxillium and Wayne (Mistborn 4-7) and Sean and Gus (Psych) . Now added to that list is Hadrian and Royce Thievery and Shenanigans I love that they aren\u2019t really the good guys\u2026.their allegiances are to the highest bidder and forget words like duty and honor\u2026.those will just get you killed. \u201dI don\u2019t have any political leanings. They get in the way of my job. Noble or commoner, people all lie, cheat, and pay me to do their dirty work. Regardless of who rules, the sun still shines, the seasons still change, and people still conspire. If you must place labels on attitudes, I prefer to think of myself as an individualist.\u201d Interesting Characters Not only are Hadrian and Royce interesting but they meet a slew of others along the way that are completely interesting too. Like a princess that could either be trying to save or kill her brother, a magician who has been locked in a tower for almost a thousand years, a curious monk and some sword fighting brothers. And that is just in the first story. Humor One of the great things that I found in MJS\u2019s writing was the humor both in dialogue and situation. Royce and Hadrian seem to find trouble everywhere they go and it apparently they took one job that was just too good to be true and ended up in a heap of trouble. But it was extremely fun watching them get out of it. \u201cSo,\u201d Royce said, \u201cyou want us to escape from this prison, kidnap the king, cross the countryside with him in tow while dodging soldiers who I assume might not accept our side of the story, and go to another secret prison so that he can visit an inmate?\u201d Arista did not appear amused. \u201cEither that, or you can be tortured to death in four hours.\u201d \u201cSounds like a really good plan to me,\u201d Hadrian declared.\u201cRoyce?\u201d \u201cI like any plan where I don\u2019t die a horrible death.\u201d \u265aBook I: The Crown Conspiracy : 3.75 Stars\u265a This is more of an introductory get to know the characters and set everything up book. Still a lot happened and I enjoyed my time getting a few glimpses into our dynamic duo and the world they live in. There were conspiracies afoot everywhere and I didn\u2019t know who to trust. Add in a good sword fight, an evil plot by a church and the rescue of a damsel in distress and color me happy. \u265aBook II: Avempartha : 4.25 Stars\u265a Now that we understand our characters a little better it is time for them to play the reluctant heroes. This ties in a little with the characters of the first book bringing back a few we saw before. There is also a monster to be slain, a damsel in distress ( man those chicks are everywhere ), an Elvish Tower, and dare I say some set up for an overall arc that will eventually lead to some elves and possibly a lot of magic *crosses fingers* I liked this story just a little better but that had a lot to do with the widening of the world building and the set up for a larger series arc I know is coming. Plus there is a dangerous wizard running around and he seems to be keeping tabs on Hadrian and Royce and who knows what team he is really playing for. \u2656 Overall 4 Stars \u2656 I\u2019m looking forward to reading how this world opens up and I definitely enjoyed this first Omnibus. The Omnibus really makes the stories the perfect size to pack a lot in without being overly wordy and too lost in description. PLUS if you like Audiobooks at all it is narrated by Tim Gerard Reynolds and he is fantastic. ...more Torn between 2 and 3 stars, opted with two. I wanted to love this book. I liked it well enough, but after all the hype, I was ultimately disappointed with it. This should have been right up my happy little alley. I should be drooling over the series.

I'll start with the pros: The overarching plot of the Heir of Novron and the strife between the church, the kingdoms and the popular movement was very enjoyable. When these things were discussed, the book really held my attention and made me excited to find out more. The treatment of the elves, and the history between humans and elves was pretty interesting. I liked the elven magic in play at the tower and I'd like to know more about how the elves exist in human lands. Royce's secret at the end really gives a nice set up for what could happen later on. Hadrian's potential inheritance is exciting, too...depending on if it gets proper treatment later. Myron was very fun to read. It would have been interesting to spend more time with him and watch his character develop. The introduction of Esrahaddon and the prison he was in was inventive and definitely creepy. Thrace (view spoiler) [ killing the lizard thing! (hide spoiler) ] The cover art definitely earns the title \"Epic.\" I mean, look at it. It's epic. Unfortunately, the cons: Lengthy and multiple \"Well, Bob...\" sections. A \"Well, Bob\" is where a character asks a dumb question - something they should know - in order to give another character the chance to answer. The worst offense of this was when Royce and Hadrian were confronted by members of Royce's old gang. I think one of the gang members even asked the guy talking why he was going on and on. I asked the same question! The cultural \"feel\" of the world was inconsistent. This might be something that would only bother someone like me, but in what world would people named Archibald, Vince, Theron, Hadrian, Royce and Ethelred all exist at the same time? This is similar to the problem I had with Dhampir, which had characters named Beth-rae, Brendan, Leesil and Magiere. It would have been helpful if each kingdom had an individual cultural flavor, even if simply for the sake of keeping everyone straight. Esrahaddon kept spitting out the solutions to every problem and mystery, over and over again. It was maddening, to say the least. We didn't get much of a chance to see these allegedly awesome people, Hadrian and Royce, at work, because everything was handed to them. This was one of my biggest problems with the book. In general, everything came to Hadrian and Royce far too easily for my taste. No one really made any mistakes, no main characters were in mortal peril, and no puzzle was too impossible. The thieves weren't very thief-y. They're awfully altruistic for being on the wrong side of the moral compass. True, they threatened that guy in the alley for (view spoiler) [setting them up to take the fall (hide spoiler) ] , but then they're like \"awww he has kids,\" and that's that. The plot moved along a bit quickly. The time the prince spends with Royce and Hadrian really could have shown some character development in him, maybe in a way reminiscent of Eddings' Belgariad. Argh. The bottom line is, I was mostly frustrated by the number of opportunities the author missed. ...more 3.5 So I've given this book 3.5 stars as the 1st half (Theft of swords) is 3 star quality and the 2nd half (Avempartha) is 4 star (This book is the compilation of 2 previously published books).

It chronicles the adventures of the legendary thief partnership Riyria, which is Elvish for 'two' (all the years I spent studying Elvish are finally paying off). Theft of Swords- 3 Stars For the most part Theft of swords was an enjoyable, lighthearted fantasy adventure. However at times the impersonal narrative voice made it difficult to get involved in the story. This technique is used to ensure that mysterious mystery duo Riyria remain. yep you guessed it, mysterious. However the lack of understanding of the motivations of the 2 lead characters meant that it was hard to really care about them. Other than a few hints at hidden backstories their characters never extend beyond fearless master-thieves bantering their way through adventures. While they're still likeable characters they don't drive the plot forward. Because of this other characters come to the fore. Arista is a princess who likes to hang out in a tower. Despite this she is a really cool character. Her solitary personality and involvement in illegal magic allow her to avoid falling into the bottomless pit of identical 'strong willed princesses' in virtually every work of contemporary fantasy. Her brother Alric is another well-written character. He spends the book in between the fantasy tropes of the spoiled prince, the evil prince and the good prince without ever falling decisively into 1. His obligatory (and tropey) journey of self-discovery and ultimate decision to take the throne for the good of his people despite his personal doubts felt rushed and shoe-horned into the plot. I also thought his path to the throne and experience of the real world could have taken up more of the screen time assigned to Riyria. (view spoiler) [ A personal highlight of the book for me was the revolt in the city. In a rare occurrence in the book the traditional fantasy trope of the commoners rising up in support of their rightful king against the evil tyrant was subverted. Instead we see a mob killing and looting indiscriminately led by Mason, a drunken gambler who blames his failings on the government rather than himself and kills without a conscience. This section was one of the few sections where the book wasn't a lighthearted adventure and for me that's what made it so gripping. (hide spoiler) ] Avempartha The second part of this book starts off slow but as it progresses a broader view of world politics is revealed and we start to understand what is really going on. The climax of Avempartha is powerful and engaging with characters we've come to love and hate meeting brutal and sudden ends while the plot develops in unexpected ways. While I really enjoyed her character in 'Theft' in 'Avempartha' Arista was turned into an almost unbelievably stupid and gullible pawn. On that note here is my Arista gullibility count 1) When Saldur, a representative of a powerful, ambitious foreign power with plans to control her kingdom assigns a domineering, nosy woman with a suspicious background as her minder she doesn't even consider that she might be a spy. 2) Saldur previously gave damning testimony accusing her of witchcraft and of murdering her own father and supported her immediate execution. When she is released she forgives him immediately and allows him to keep his position of power in the kingdom 3) When Saldur admits to betraying and conspiring to murder her father before pinning it on her she shows no apparent reaction. She then seriously considers helping him in his schemes and later is bummed when he isn't around to have some pleasant conversation with. Ugh. Summary: Gullible Arista is gullible Saldur himself is a character with some really interesting motivation. Halfway through he reveals his plan to end the feudal, independent monarchies that control the world in favour of a centralised bureaucratic system similar to Imperial China. I found this really interesting as feudalism (the most popular setting in fantasy) and systems like it have come into practice at various times and places throughout history. Invariably they appear when society is boned (see 'Dark ages' Europe) and are generally low points for civilisation. The desire to create a strong empire to improve the lives of its people is a noble goal. A corrupt, scheming church with a figurehead emperor probably isn't the way to do that however. I hope the rest of the series examines the benefits of independent kingdoms against a unified empire instead of just presenting it as good kingdoms vs. evil empire. All in all this is an enjoyable book that I would recommend as lighhearted adventure. However it's highlights were when it took the story in a more ambitious, challenging direction and I hope the rest of the series takes the chance to expand on this. ...more 3ish stars The first in a high fantasy series epic in length, if not necessarily in content. Or at least not by the time this first installment ends. In a lot of ways this is a really refreshing book because, though it more or less follows the basic formula for an epic fantasy story (minus a few noticeable deviations), it does so with the lightheartedness, humor and joy that's missing from most books in the genre.

For the same reason I wasn't affected by it quite as much as I hoped to be. I wasn't pulled in with the same gripping tension. Most of the characters are quite enjoyable. The partners who make up the duo of Riyria, Royce and Hadrian, are awesome and lovable despite how we're led to believe they're unprincipled, cutthroat thieves. They're honestly two of the most altruistic characters in literature I can currently think of. As far as I can tell, they're all talk, but wouldn't actually hurt a fly. Still. Love those guys. And I love that there's little bit of mystery surrounding them. The political conflicts are actually pretty interesting, but the antagonists behind the conflicts are practically indistinguishable from one another in their sneering, evil evilness. Many of the other supporting characters are on the border between two-and-three-dimensional, but showed evidence of growth throughout the book leaving me hopeful for the future. The plot of the first part, The Crown Conspiracy, was adequate, nothing to write home about. The second part, Avempartha, was a marked improvement and kept me interested after I questioned whether I should continue. I'm glad I did. I have to say, I wasn't into this nearly as much as I was into Age of Myth, the first in a new series chronicling the history of this same world in the far distant past. Maybe Sullivan's writing has just improved? Maybe this book is just a little too traditional for my tastes? Either way, having read Age of Myth first, it was awesome to catch the references between the two books and connect the dots between the various story elements. I look forward to more of that as I continue with each series. Audiobook narrator Tim Gerard Reynolds is fantastic. Audiobook is definitely recommended. ...more Riyria books are like matryoshka dolls, books within books.

After 50 pages, I was already emotionally invested in the heroes and wanted to know all about them. Whereas Royce is taciturn and cantankerous, Hadrian is optimistic and charming. I loved their easy banter and the way they'd huff and puff about being an evil villain, afraid of being seen as do-gooders. As for the other characters: Myron was cute as button; Arista was like a movie extra; we meet briefly with Yoda, sorry I mean Esrahaddon the wizard in the first book and then, he comes back as the pheasant king of the last wizards; and I wanted to dress Alric as Joffrey and throw him at Game of Thrones fans. To be fair, he gets better as the story progresses and he never reaches to Joffrey's levels of being killable, but his basic nature of being a conceited arse doesn't change. The political aspect of the story was so simple, I had no problem understanding it and guessing the reasoning behind the events. Me calling something political easy is the equivalent of calling it dummies version , it can be considered an insult as well. I am even fuzzy on what constitutes as politics! The religious part was feeble and shopworn. God sending his son to help humanity, seriously? Spicing it up with rape doesn't make it original. More like desperate. Just saying... Despite of the negative points, I enjoyed the book immensely. To be honest, I didn't even think of criticising anything except Alric, while reading. All of the bitching above comes from a later time. I can't wait to read rest of the series! Btw I think I've got who's the heir of Nevron. (view spoiler) [ it's Royce isn't it? and Hadrian is the guard?

I absolutely love the characters, their interaction, and the story. Given the different media in which I chose for this reread and the superb narration of Tim Gerard Reynolds, I can only say that it had been wonderfully and thoroughly enjoyable. There's only one thing left for me to do - upgrade this to 5-stars and add it into my favourites shelf! :) --------------------------------------- May 2015 (ebook): After plowing through a few grimdark novels of significant size this year, I was thirsting for something less mentally exhausting and more fun to read. Enter Riyria! And what a breath of fresh air this has been. This volume is made up of the first 2 books of the Riyria Revelations, ie The Crown Conspiracy and Avempartha The Crown Conspiracy (3.5 stars) This book is probably the shortest in the series making it a really quick read. It is good introduction to the Riyria duo, Hadrian and Royce, who seemed to be more than what they appear to be on the surface and were complete opposites. Barely 3 chapters in and I was already having a mini crush on Hadrian, the classic warrior hero who is tall, handsome and has a cheerful demeanour - and he carries 3 swords!! I think that was the clincher for me (one does not carry 3 swords unless he really knows how to use them). Royce\u2019s character was a bit harder to warm up to \u2013 the thief who probably grew up in harsh conditions and honed to be terribly effective in what he does (he does a dry sense of humour though). But together, the pair just seemed to work and their banter was funny and entertaining. The plot was simple (the blurb summarises it quite succinctly), the pacing decent with adequate action and elements of danger and mystery. The book just flew by very quickly for me. I have mentioned before that I\u2019m not particular about prose in general, and I appreciate the simple manner of storytelling that was employed by the author. Avempartha (4.0 stars) Having done with the introductions in The Crown Conspiracy, Avempartha takes the story to the next level fairly quickly. The political intrigue that was revealed at the end of the first book took on greater proportions in this instalment. We finally have more female representation in the cast via Princess Arista, and Thrace Wood (a daughter of a farmer). The mysteriousness of the Riyria duo by now fades into fascination as we are clued on to more of their back story. How Hadrian became such an amazing swordsman is a revelation that made me sit up and go \u201cNooo waaaaay!! That is so cool!\u201d The reveal was also quite well orchestrated as it did not come by way of heavy exposition and even by the end of the book, it remained \u201cunspoken\u201d. Royce\u2019s heritage and notoriety in his previous life made his character more compelling and interesting. By now, I was very keen to read The Crown Tower (the first book of the Riyria Chronicles) but was advised to finish with the Revelations series first. Avempartha definitely had a \u2018darker\u2019 tone compared to the first in the series with greater stakes at hand, and an unexpected ending to the climax. All in all, the series is showing great promise to get better and deeper as it progresses. Riyria Revelations is leaning more towards what I will refer to as classic fantasy although it's not exactly as traditional as, say, the Belgariad. It's fairly lighthearted and fun, with just the right dose of action, magic, danger, antagonists to despise and a main character that I can swoon over. What can I say, well-written fantasy tropes can be just plain fun sometimes! ...more I wish I could have liked the book in order to give the book a higher rating, especially when Michael J. Sullivan is probably the author that I know that interacts the most on Goodreads, but the book had too many tropes. I read the book because Michael really wanted everyone to read the book, and told him I would check it out. Before I read the book, I thought the book was on the level like all others writing in fantasy, without any tropes, trying to be different.

Before I read the book, I thought the book was on the level like all others writing in fantasy, without any tropes, trying to be different. Then I read the extra that the publisher, Orbits has in all their books first, and found out he actually enjoyed all tropes a lot more than all the ones that were trying to different, especially with the films coming out in the 70s because Star Wars had an great impact on him, and it will filled with tropes. I've read too many fantasies to enjoy the tropes anymore. I don't even know when was the last time I read in a fantasy that had elves and dwarves anymore with a lighter quest. I don't think in the past 15 years there has been many epic fantasies written with elves and dwarves. I did enjoy the book, but I don't think I will continue on with the anymore of his works. P.S. I enjoyed the first story a lot more than the second. ...more The Crown Conspiracy The Crown Conspiracy was even better than I had expected. Royce and Hadrian are really great characters, they make a very interesting (and hilarious) team. While Hadrian is a righteous ex-soldier, Royce is a cynical thief with a devious mind, and these two guys make a great team, and Ocean 11 instantly pops to my mind when I think about this team. Both are extremely capable, each in his own way. The supporting characters are quite good, and they evolve though the book, which The Crown Conspiracy The Crown Conspiracy was even better than I had expected.

Both are extremely capable, each in his own way. The supporting characters are quite good, and they evolve though the book, which was nice because in some books the supporting characters are somewhat weak. As for the plot - it gets better as you keep reading. Until 70% mark it was quite good, though it gets better while there's lots of intrigue and schemes are unravel which makes things more interesting. It also seems like the series can expand and become really epic. Plus, the pace is great, it's a very action-oriented book. Now I'm proceeding with Theft of Swords. All in all, it's a really fun read, and although there're some fantasy tropes they don't manifest in a traditional way. 4.5/5 Avempartha It's a quite good book, but not as fun as The Crown Conspiracy. Until the 2/3 mark the it felt much slower and not too much happened, though the writing was great and Royce and Hadrian are a great team. The last third had a much better pace and the plot moved forward until the great climax at the end. While The Crown Conspiracy was a great \"Ocean 11\"-style book, this one felt like a warm-up to the upcoming books in the series. As the story unfolds we get more insights into the past, learn about the elves, and get more interesting hints about Royce and Hadrian's past (could have easily figured out since book 1). The Church of Nyphron are full of worldwide-scale schemes, and Saldur reveals his motivation to end all the monarchies and unite them under one empire like the old times. The first 2/3 worth about 4, while the last third about 4.25-4.5. 4-4.25 Total Score: 4.25/5 ...more The first thing you should know about Theft of Swords is that it\u2019s not a fine dining experience. This book is not the literary equivalent of going to a fancy restaurant and getting one of those huge plates that are mostly empty except for a tiny stalk of asparagus artfully drizzled with a delicate sauce.

Instead, it\u2019s more like sitting down hungry and getting a big, tasty burger you can just grab and sink your teeth into. (Vegetarians, please substitute for the vegetarian equivalent of a big, tasty burger. I\u2019ve been trying to think of one, and I can\u2019t. A veggie burger just doesn\u2019t feel the same.) In other words, this book is straightforward. It\u2019s huge. It\u2019s low on subtlety but high on enjoyment. It is (and I fully realize this is not proper Literary Theory terminology) juicy. At this point I think I\u2019ve stretched the food metaphor about as far as it\u2019s going to go. The next thing to know about this book is that it\u2019s, well, actually two books. (Like a two patty burger! Sorry. I\u2019m really done now.) Theft of Swords is an omnibus containing The Crown Conspiracy and Avempartha, the first two books in Michael J. Sullivan\u2019s RIYRIA REVELATIONS. If you follow fantasy blogs at all, you\u2019re probably familiar with how this omnibus came to be. (And if you happen to write a fantasy blog you\u2019re definitely aware, thanks to the vigorous \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d guerrilla marketing campaign that\u2019s partly responsible for making this series such a big success.) In a nutshell: these books were originally self-published. They became such a big indie success that Orbit has now picked up the series. Orbit is re-releasing the original six books in a set of three omnibus editions: Theft of Swords, Rise of Empire, and Heir of Novron. The two novels contained in Theft of Swords have been reviewed so many times that it\u2019s probably not necessary to go into a huge amount of detail. Their main characters are the thief Royce Melborn and the warrior Hadrian Blackwater, best friends who are both immensely skilled at what they do. They make a living taking on various assignments for nobles (often playing one noble against the other for double the profit) until one job gets them unwillingly involved in a far-reaching plot that affects the royal family of a kingdom and, eventually, the future of the entire world of Elan. As the plot evolves and thickens, you learn more about the structure and history of Elan, including multiple races (humans, elves, goblins, dwarves), deities, and political affiliations. The two fantasy novels in Theft of Swords are extremely entertaining. There\u2019s lots of action, flashes of humor, and some surprisingly (for a fluffy action fantasy novel) emotional moments. The characters are (at this point at least) paper-thin, but they\u2019re mostly likable and the heroes are easy to root for. There\u2019s simply not a dull moment to be found here. The fantasy world occasionally feels like a composite of familiar elements, but there are also hints that some more original pieces are waiting in the wings. Michael J. Sullivan is great at breaking down the world and its history into manageable chunks so they don\u2019t overshadow the adventure, but if you take a step back and put all those pieces together, you can see that there\u2019s more complexity here than you\u2019d initially expect. The books don\u2019t exactly brim with originality, but they\u2019re so much sheer fun that it\u2019s easy to get swept along. One noticeable difference between the two novels in this omnibus, at least for a first time reader like myself, is that The Crown Conspiracy seems much more of a standalone story than Avempartha. It introduces the characters and the world, but its plot feels self-contained, whereas Avempartha seems to be the start of a longer story arc. The Crown Conspiracy also feels much more lighthearted. Which reminds me of a somewhat related topic: I suggest taking a break between the two books. The first book has a lot of forward momentum, and everything slams to a halt at the start of book two because it\u2019s, well, a whole new novel. You can avoid the feeling that the plot suddenly moves at a creep rather than a gallop by picking up something else to cleanse your palate (which is officially my final food-related metaphor for this review.) For people who have read the original books, there are a few differences between those and the ones found in this omnibus, including a new opening section for the first book, a glossary in the back, and a list of countries, deities, and political parties in the front. However, unless you\u2019re a collector, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to get the omnibus if you have the original editions. I\u2019m giving this one 3.5 stars, which for me means \u201cbetween good and excellent.\u201d This rating isn\u2019t based on gorgeous prose, or deep characterization, or striking originality. It\u2019s simply based on sheer, plain fun. This book reminded me of how much fun I had when I first discovered fantasy, *mumble* years ago. It reminded me of reading the original DRAGONLANCE trilogies, or even David Eddings\u2019 BELGARIAD and MALLOREON series: I just kept turning pages until there weren\u2019t any pages left to turn, without worrying about (or even being aware of) things like originality and depth. Much like those titles, Theft of Swords seems to straddle the line between YA and regular fiction, which might also make it a good series to get younger readers into fantasy. I had a blast with this book, even if I occasionally had to force myself to put away my mental red pencil so I could just enjoy the ride. If you\u2019re in the mood for some straightforward, old-fashioned adventure fantasy, and you haven\u2019t had the chance to check out the RIYRIA REVELATIONS yet, pick up a copy of Theft of Swords. (This review also appeared at www.fantasyliterature.com on 1/5/2012.) ...more This Riyria Revelations omnibus included the first two books in the series, The Crown Conspiracy and Avempartha. The Crown Conspiracy This was a fun sword and sorcery style fantasy. The plot revolves around two thieves who take on the job of stealing a nobleman's sword only to find themselves caught up in a plot to assassinate the king. It was a fun read.

The story was packed with humor, action, adventure, intrigue, and magic. The lead characters Hadrian and Royce were very likable. I loved the witty and amusing banter between the pair. They were backed by a great cast of well drawn secondary characters. Avempartha This was just as good as the first book and mostly for the same reasons. Hadrian and Royce are back and again contracted to steal a sword, this time from an impenetrable tower, as it is needed to help save a village from magical beast with a thirst for blood. The Church of Nyphron continued their Imperialist intrigue which gave the plot a greater scope and lead to this installment feeling like a strange mix of sword and sorcery and epic fantasy. I liked the combination. Overall I really enjoyed this omnibus. Both books were fast paced and fun reads. I'm eager to read more of the adventures of Hadrian and Royce. Rating: 4.5 stars. Audio Note: This was narrated by Tim Gerard Reynolds. Reynolds is a good narrator for the most part. He has a good understanding of the nuances of voice needed to convey the right emotions in multiple different situations. If he has a weakness it is his unfortunate choice of accents for some characters. ...more Okay...this is one of those books where I think an initial reaction would be, \"score\". I really enjoyed it.

After a long dry spell where I hadn't found a really \"good\" read I stumbled on this/these. As a friend on mine here might say...wooohooo. Only on occasion do you find a book you can wholeheartedly recommend but in this case I can. I realize that others won't like these as well as I do (this book is actually the first 2 in the Riyria Revelations) but for me I can as I said, recommend it/them. We have here the story of \"Riyria\"...apparently 2 guys. They are \"well known\" (apparently that's why we have a \"trade name\" here) thieves and possibly assassins. You need something stolen that can't be stolen? You need a job done that...can't be done? These might be your people. There's a rumor in the kingdom that a couple of guys stole the crown jewels one night and put them back the next....wonder why anyone would do that? Of course these two will, or might work for the highest bidder. They might consider stealing something for...one party, and then for enough money stealing it back. They might be very, very sharp....but then they also might, sometimes get involved in something, just because it's, the right thing to do. I have already bought the rest of this series and look forward to getting into them (actually I already started the next but have 2 library books to read first). So, action adventure, fantasy, wizardry, well done characters well plotted stories, it's all here. I can recommend these and do. Enjoy. ...more The Crown Conspiracy Royce Melborn and Hadrian Blackwater are a resourceful duo in a questionable profession, they work as thieves and they are impressive.

When a last second easy yet highly profitable opportunity comes their way to steal a legendary sword, Hadrian jumps at it. Royce grudgingly agrees to steal the sword for the King's castle. When they arrive there is no sword at all, only a dead King. Now Hadrian and Royce have been framed for murdering a King and it looks like there is nothing they can do. So this is a retry for me. I attempted The Crown Conspiracy before and while I enjoyed the characters, I didn't get into the story. Well, this attempt was quite different. I found myself deeply connecting with what was happening led by the memorable Royce and Hadrian. While I have a predisposition to disliking thieves these two fall somewhere between cold blooded thieves and Robin Hood. Truly Royce is the colder of the two while Hadrian has a conscious and wants to do the right thing. That desire puts the duo in a bad spot. The Crown Conspiracy is for readers who enjoy a traditional yet exciting tale of deception and heroism. 3.5 out of 5 stars Avempartha A young woman named Thrace is searching for Royce Melborn and Hadrian Blackwater in a distant city. She seeks to hire them on the advice of a Mr. Haddon who told her where to find them. Intrigued Royce agrees if only to find out what Esrahaddon is doing. He wants Royce to break into the tower, Avempartha, near a waterfall that seems impossible to reach. The duo seek to steal the only sword that can kill a magical beast that's destroying a town and murdering it's inhabitants. Avempartha is a good sequel to The Crown Conspiracy. Royce and Hadrian are as interesting as ever and the world has become more dangerous thanks to a magical beast and the church's plans. The story somewhat departs from the break neck speed of its predecessor because the characters aren't consistently fleeing for their lives, but nighttime is deadly and the villagers are helpless against it's might. Hadrian Blackwater is an incredibly easy character to like. He has quite the conscious despite his line of work and it occasionally forces him into helping when the wisest course of action would be fleeing. Avempartha is a good albeit a somewhat familiar story. 3.5 out of 5 stars ...more I was lucky, I guess. I came back to reading fantasy after a long hiatus, and this was the first book I picked up.

The dialog is good, as well. The story looks fresh after endless \"a reluctant/unsuspecting nobody is destined to save the world\" fantasy cliches. It is by no means Lord of the Rings, but it does not pretend to be one. In conclusion, I highly recommend this book as entertaining and fun read. ...more", "Title": "Theft of Swords"},
