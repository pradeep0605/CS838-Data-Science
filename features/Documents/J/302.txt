Probably that last one. Everything good about Terry Pratchet you've probably been told or read (or said and written, if you're a fan) is true. His fans love him to peices. Me too. (It is a very good thing for me that I came to The Beatles and The Smiths on my own with no awareness of fanbases...) (I'm not trendy. Proof of my inbred untrendiness: Welsh roots instead of Irish.) What decided me? A Buffy the Vampire Slayer comparison on the book jacket of the first <---C>Tiffany Aching</---C> book. (With 38 and counting Disc World books out there, the four book series is a good place to start. It's not intimidating to have a little slice cut out. That said, you can read any Disc World book first.) (One thing I love about the Disc World books, one person's \"It's funny and quite good\" can be another person's \"My personal favorite!\" Don't always go by those four or five star ratings on gr. You could still hit your own \"Oh hell yes\" Disc World stride. This isn't prolificness for the sake of being prolific. Pratchett has something to say. Tiffany Aching,<---M> for instance</---M>, came to him as such that he dropped everything else he was doing to write her.) Lots of things are wrongly compared to 'Buffy', of course (probably by people who didn't realize why 'Buffy' was really great). Maybe it was my twin's rec coupled with the Buffy. Whatever it was, Buffy decided me. No, Tiffany Aching isn't Buffy herself, but one thing 'Buffy' the show and 'Tiffany' the series have in common (besides names with unfair reputations. Thank goodness Mariel hasn't yet become a \"bimbo\" name. I'm flying below the radar he he he) is that everything good you've heard is true. You can open up any line in a Terry Pratchett book and find a line to knock your socks off. I'll do it right now, for example. (Trust that I'm doing this randomly. No fixed fights.) (John Turturro in Quiz Show is theatrically patting the sweat off his brow.) \"The world is full of omens, and you picked the ones you liked.\" (page 145 of <+++>I Shall Wear Midnight</+++>, hardback edition). (Turturro: \"They made me take a dive!\" You could've chosen a better line than that. But I like that one!) I'm going to try (I said try!) to express why I loved the final Tiffany Aching book (hell, that whole series) so much in a way that doesn't veer into hyperbole that will not make an outsider feel lonely. The magic is personal magic, from the heart, earth, soul. The witches are the people who fix things that nobody else knows needs fixing. People who fall through the cracks, are left to die alone, the witches warm their cold feet, bury them when they need to. That's magic. The darkness of the world is fear of the unknown, losing yourself to hatred, being too clever and stupid at the same time, stupid people being clever, losing because the world is often unfair. Are you yourself, the girl, or the hat (the witch)? I think anyone can relate to that feeling of being just your job, how sometimes the lines blur because of how you are seen by others. I don't think this is just a ya series. Sometimes I feel embarrassed by coming-of-age stories about younger characters who become much more emotionally evolved than I am (turning 31 the day after writing this review). Not so with Tiffany. I don't think the expectations are unreasonable, or ignore other complicated human feeling possibilties. If anything, it is encouraged to think about things (the magical powers of first thoughts. And second thoughts, thinking about what you were thinking in first thoughts). It's not denying your own personal hurts, but also acknowledging that the world isn't about only you. Adjusting to expectations, retaining the dreams and keeping the right to have them without bitterness... I loved that. Yeah, I'm not 9-15 (her ages in the series), but Tiffany is my role model. Terry Pratchett is funny, he's witty, tongue in cheek, he's got style and grace. He does it that it looks easy and you don't even notice he's doing it. It would be easy to take him for granted because he's always at least very, very good. Pratchett could probably be one of those witches that are taken for granted because they are always there doing their thing sometimes on the fringes and sometimes in big saving the day blasts. (He won't always be there. Sad face.) This isn't technical fantasy about fictional distant lands and politics name-dropping and weaponry names. It's very real feeling. That's what would appeal to me the most, anyway. Emotions in the thinking way. I loved The Wee Free Men. Hopefully the Nac Mac Feegles won't \"find\" all of my personal belongings for saying this, the fairy folk in Martin Millar's The Good Fairies of New York are more my style: rock 'n' roll and punk as opposed to... pub drunken fun. I love the little blue men, just they aren't my favorite part of the series. Give me Johnny Thunders over Floggin' Molly any time. (Or I could've said they aren't my bag...pipe. I'm not Terry Pratchett, clearly. And I've used that ahem joke before.) I loved so very much the flashbacks of Tiffany's dead grandmama. Definitely one of the most heartfelt tales of bereavement and memory I've read. The stories of the old lady terrorized to her grave that made Tiffany want to become a witch were moving and terrifying. That it had a profound effect on young Tiffany and suitable motivation for becoming a witch was something I could believe wholeheartedly. I dug the story of the travelling teachers, the chalk (based on Pratchett's own upbringing), cheese and sheep and sheepdogs, fighting the fairy queen. Every day fantastical fantasticness and seeing the mundane in the terrifying. Awesome book. Book two A Hat Full of Sky is my fuck yes that was amazing favorite Tiffany Aching book. I loved the story of the hiver who takes up camp in Tiffany's mind, how the knowledge of others changes how Tiffany thinks. It's all about thinking and feeling those first and second and third thoughts. I do that all of the time, constantly try to put myself into how someone else feels and trying to remember that I'm not the only person. This is magic to me. Wintersmith is the third book. Tiffany gets moved into the morris dance to bring in the change of the seasons and takes the place that did not belong to her, that of Summer, setting the Winter after her to take her place as his queen. Being who you aren't meant to be, making up for mistakes, learning the way of it through daily grind, that's the way of things. Some things are everything falls into place falling from the sky realizations, most of the time it is ingrained in the mind through constant wax on and wax off practice. <+++>I Shall Wear Midnight</+++> is the earned culimination of the three books that came before it. Almost like little hindsight short stories in Tiffany's daily life of hard work and precious little sleep, 'Midnight' is the just growing up story. Making the every day into magic is the most magical thing there is. Doing that is HARD. Now I'll indulge myself: Crivens! Terry Pratchett is awesome. ...more Things are hostile toward witches on The Chalk and Tiffany Aching aims to find out why. But how can she with the future mother-in-law of the new baron gunning for her? Can the Nac Mac Feegle help her clear her name and the name of witches everywhere?

He's written something like 50 Discworld books and has been stricken with early onset Altzheimers. I'm proud to say there was no phoning in, or even texting in, in this one. Like all of the Discworld books, this book is about something. It's about prejudice and mass hysteria, how seemingly rational people can be driven to do some pretty irrational things. It's funny how a lot of people dismiss the Discworld books as fantasy parody when they're so much more. The Nac Mac Feegle, demented Scottish smurfs that they are, provide comic relief as always. Preston, the guard who's too smart to be a guard, provided a believable future love interest for Tiffany. Tiffany herself has come a long way since the Wee Free Men. Her grace The Duchess was such a foul villainess I couldn't wait to see her taken down a peg. The Cunning Man was pretty horrible as far as Pratchett villains go. And the cameos by Vimes, Nanny Ogg, and Granny Weatherwax were worth the price of admission. Something that not many people mention, Terry Pratchett does a lot to advance the concept of the fantasy witch as more than juts a cackling hag. He portrays them more like shaman or jacks of all trades, doing whatever is necessary for the people in their steading. So why a four? Why not five? I'll tell you, Arnold. For one thing, the ending was a little too easy. For another, too many plot threads were swept under the rug. Amber, the girl who's dad beat the hell out of her, was forgotten for most of the book after spending time with the kelda of the Nac Mac Feegle. The Duchess, likewise, was defused at the wedding near the end and it seemed out of character. The thread of Letitia being a witch came out of left field and also didn't go very far. It could be that old Pratch is planning another Tiffany Aching novel but I was under the impression that this one is the last. All in all, this was a worthy addition to the Tiffany Aching saga and the Discworld series. Lots of laughs and also some thought provoking stuff. ...more This is more of the same for this subseries \u2013 which is a good thing! More adolescent witch adventures, more growing up too fast, more dry humor with teeth underneath. Critics go on about how magic in fantasy novels is a metaphor for political power or social power or insert power here.

Which is a good metaphor for social power, often, but it\u2019s not very interesting \u2013 you are powerful because you are, and you are because you are. Okay then. I read this months ago, but I still remember what I liked about it. Tiffany is a really powerful witch, but not in the usual fantasy novel way. Her power is in direct proportion to how smart she is, and how careful. She doesn\u2019t have some inexplicable inner spring of magic, and this book is very clear: Tiffany wasn\u2019t born chosen. She made herself a witch because there was a terrible need; because someone died in a small, common, horrible way; because someone had to do something , and she was there. That is a magic whose metaphors I can get behind. IN fact, the metaphors pretty much collapse. These aren\u2019t books with stupid extended training montages where young people learn magic by chanting a lot. Tiffany learns by living. That\u2019s not a metaphor at all, that\u2019s good literature. I love that. And I love that Tiffany doesn\u2019t always wear power well, that she struggles for compassion, that she feels isolated. I love how almost everyone in this book is faking it inside whatever role they\u2019re living. I don\u2019t love some slightly odd ways this book talks about post-violence trauma, but that\u2019s a whole other conversation. ...more I would read the phone book if Terry Pratchett wrote it.

(This happens often.) It seemed appropriate, given that the US release of The Shepherd's Crown is Tuesday, and turned out to be exactly what I needed on a Sunday evening. There were things I remembered: Tiffany's changed relationship with Roland, the Nac Mac Feegle in Ankh-Morpork, Letitia the very damp Duchess's daughter with unsuspected depth. What I'd forgotten is the strong theme of responsibility that ties the whole thing together. Tiffany Aching, as the new witch of the Chalk, bears responsibility for hundreds of people, most of whom fear her, or possibly fear what she represents. One of Tiffany's gifts is balancing between good and evil, pain and peace, and at the beginning of the book she's become so obsessed with playing that role that she's forgotten, just a little, why it is she's doing it. She's justifiably proud of her skills--she's the girl who kissed the winter, after all--but it's made her somewhat distant from the people she has to serve. So when a formless evil sets its sights on her, she's put in a position where all her skills are, if not useless, at least ineffective to fight her opponent. Woven into the plot is Tiffany's need to grow and understand the world in ways outside her experience. By the end, she knows why witches face tragedy and suffering and the hard choices the way they do, and for all her skills, it's that moment when Tiffany is a true witch. I remember being a little put off by the dissolution of Tiffany and Roland's romance (this is not a spoiler, it's revealed in the first few pages) because that relationship had been telegraphed fairly well in previous books. But the explanation even Tiffany has to accept is that the two of them really were just thrown together, and mistook their both being alone and different for being compatible. Their relationship as future Baron and witch makes a lot more sense, and I like Roland's fianc\u00e9e Letitia very much, even before we find out her secret. (view spoiler) [Letitia as accidental witch amuses me. It fits with young Amber, who seems despite her race to be a born kelda; both girls have abilities no one suspected and both embrace those skills with a sort of careless \"well, of course I can do this, what do you mean it's unusual?\" that sets up a different type of witch from the ones we've seen to date. Giving a terrifying skeleton a teddy bear to calm him down is brilliant. (hide spoiler) ] But the heart of any Tiffany Aching story is the Feegles, who were mostly played for laughs in Carpe Jugulum but have steadily become--like pretty much everything about the Discworld--a serious, solid presence in the story. Not that they aren't still hilarious; I love Daft Wullie, who is guaranteed to say the wrong thing every time. But the image of Rob Anybody ready to start a war to defend his wife and family--that's deadly serious. And there are so many serious moments between the funny ones that it's a little strange to look back over the Discworld series and realize those early books were written by the same man. I have no idea what to expect from the final Discworld book. Terry Pratchett's later works, after his illness was serious, aren't quite to the same quality as the earlier ones. What I'm looking for, I think, is a sense of closure. Raising Steam , for all its faults, brought to an end several plot threads that had been unreeling for several books, and I found that satisfying. I look forward to seeing how the final chapter in Tiffany's story plays out. ...more Terry Pratchett is a genius! This book is the fourth in the Tiffany Aching Adventures, and my favorite so far, I think. Tiffany is a sixteen-year-old witch, self-assured and very wise beyond her years, yet still down to earth (or, in her case, chalk) and still sixteen.

She is once again joined by her small, blue, kilted, ale-drinking, fist-fighting, hygienically challenged, oft-invisible clan of Nac Mac Feegles who provide the story's comic relief. Her nemesis this time is the Cunning Man--the pure, stinking essence of evil left eons ago when a witch-burning fanatic was drawn into the flames himself by one of his young victims. Tiffany realizes that a bit of him exists in all of us as the seed of doubt, fear and xenophobia that can grow into hatred, prejudice and mob violence all too easily. She finds herself facing off against him at a time of change and transition; the old Baron has died peacefully, just a few days before his son, Roland, is to be married. Several of Tiffany's witch sisters arrive for the occasion including Mistress Weatherwax, her severe but ultimately caring mentor, and the bawdy Nanny Ogg (who most willingly fills the bride-to-be in on some wedding night secrets and advice, wink-wink nudge-nudge). As usual, Pratchett had me in alternating tears of hilarity and tenderness and empathy. And, as always, the book ends with the reader feeling a cathartic cleansing, and the sense that Tiffany Aching is in her place, doing her job the best she knows how, and all is right with the world. ...more It is with some sadness that I finished this knowing that Sir Terry will not write any more Discworld books. He writes in the voice of a 16 year old witch so brilliantly. Although Tiffany Aching is trying very hard to be grown up, she has to keep telling herself she is the witch of the Chalk and the people rely on her to be their witch.

Tiffany is scared but knows the evil will eventually catch up with her and she will have to stand and face it alone. In the meantime she has the Wee Free Men, the Nac Mac Feegle to watch over her (when they're not getting into trouble themselves). An excellent book in this Discworld sub series. Several of our favourite personalities make an appearance,including Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg and the Ankh Morpork Watch. I'm also very glad there is still one more volume to read even if Sir Terry never got to do a final draft and it may still be a little rough in places. It will be sad to say goodbye to all our favourite characters. ...more I still feel weird putting these under the heading of \"children\u2019s books.\" They aren't, really, and never have been. Even when the main character was just a ten year old girl. So. This is the last of the Tiffany Aching books and the last time we will ever hear of Granny Weatherwax or Nanny Ogg ever again, thanks to Mr. Pratchett's disease.

I am given to understand that most of this book was, by necessity, dictated. And it's not a bad book. Quite good, given the circumstances. But a lot of characters from the Discworld seemed to just show up out of no where. It was like they were saying goodbye. Parts of it felt, when I read them, the way that last scene from the movie Labyrinth felt when I watched it. You know, when Hoggle and Ludo and everyone are telling Sarah goodbye. \"If you should need us ...\" Man. I'm sort of tearing up. Hold on a sec. AND we finally get to find out what the hell happened to Esk. I've been wondering about her for years. No lie. It was nice. It felt tidy and correct. Parts of this book were really rather rough. It was much darker in places than many of his other books. I mean, any book that starts out with the near-death of a thirteen year old pregnant girl because her father tried to beat her into the ground is going down a rather particular path, if you know what I mean. Other parts felt a little rushed. Like the love-interest. I'm not spoiling anything to say there is one in this book. Nor am I spoiling anything to say that it felt very sudden. However, over all, this is an excellent end to the Aching series and a rather good book from my favorite author of Modern fantasy. Highly recommended. ...more I don't find many books that I'd gladly give to my girl and say \"this, this is what being human is\". In the Tiffany Aching series, Pratchett nailed it and in this, the final book (which can be read alone), Pratchett nails the story too. The others have featured metaphors-come-to-life as antagonists, but they were very active antagonists. In this book, the antagonist is more in the background: he exists, there's pursuit, but it's all playing second fiddle to Tiffany's battle with her feelings and I don't find many books that I'd gladly give to my girl and say \"this, this is what being human is\".

There aren't enough stars for this character and this book. You might not like Pratchett's style or his sense of humour but his sense of humanity, and what it means to be human, is unparalleled. He makes us find sympathy for people even as he unveils their ugly side, and writes as though he loves us, warts and all. Loved it to the point of being all teary at the end because of just how fucking perfect it was. ...more Porque necesito a Terry m\u00e1s que nunca\u2026.

I read I Shall Wear Midnight a couple of months ago, and put-off writing my review until I could untangle my mixed reaction. (- ** NOTE: I Shall Wear Midnight is not actually a Locus Y-A Award winner - but the first three books in this sequence were, so I included this in my award reading list because I'm a completionist. -) I first came to the Tiffany Aching sequence sceptically. To my mind, there was no need (apart from marketing considerations) to deliberately create a new Discworld character targeting the Young-Adult niche. I started reading the Discworld books when I was twelve, and still love them now, just shy of thirty. Pratchett has always straddled the line between fantasy and satire with incredible ease, and that blend offers something for readers of all ages. So I was cynical of this YA series; it sounded more like a publisher's idea, not Terry's. But give the man scraps and he will cook you something sublime (at least, most the time). Pratchett's little heroine won me over big-time. She's awesome - really, an excellent job. I could gush for some time, but let me stay on point. I came to the sequence sceptical, and the first three books made a covert of me, which is why, by the time I reached I Shall Wear Midnight (book four following Tiffany) I was comfortably expecting something special - I'd pulled a U'ey. Thus; dissapointment. I thought it fell a bit flat. Well, a lot flat. Tiff has grown-up a great deal by this point and all the relationship dynamics are skewed. A big element of the story involves Tiff haring (no pun intended) off to Ankh-Morpork and I thought \"aw yeah, this is going to be great!\" - but you know what, it's not. The city... does not sing. There are a few cameo appearances for the Watch, and there's a new city-witch introduced (who didn't do much for me) - but by and large the city itself was very generic... it just didn't really feel all that Ankh-Morporkey to me. Big opportunity lost to crash a great character into a great setting. Anticlimatic. Throughout the book there are little 'omen' moments, forsehadowing Tiffany's eureka-moment when she saves the day (that shouldn't count as a spoiler to anyone, right?) but as familiar as I am with Sir Terry's plot-weaving skills, these felt surprisingly unsubtle, ham-fisted and poorly integrated. The nemesis Tiffany faces in I Shall Wear Midnight played too many cards similar to the Hiver monster she defeated in a previous book, and despite all efforts to play the big-bad-ominous card, Tiffany has grown into an exceptionally capable young woman and never, ever, seemed seriously at risk. I can scan a shelf of Discworld books and tell you my favourite scene from each and every one - except for Jingo , Pyramids , Lords & Ladies ... and I Shall Wear Midnight . Sorry, Terry - for me, this one was a dud. But I still gave it three stars because despite all these flaws I still 'liked' it - I never thought, \"ye, gawds, must I go back to that tome of trash again?!\". I was always happy to snatch it up for my lunch break - (and let's be honest, I would happily read An In-Depth Guide to Precision Grouting if it was written by Pratchett) - but my attention drifted frequently and by the end I was keen to move onto the next book on my list (which was better). After this I read: Leviathan ...more Bah. Made me cry. Curse you Terry Pratchett! Hat Made of Sky is still my favourite of the Tiffany Aching books, but I might even put this one second. The plot wasn't as tight as he (historically) has been capable of, and the menace of the villain didn't live up to its potential, quite. But there was so much other stuff here to love, and be moved by, and remind me of other things, that I didn't really care. For the first half, seriously, I could only read about forty pages at a time because then I Bah. Made me cry. Curse you Terry Pratchett!

For the first half, seriously, I could only read about forty pages at a time because then I would get sad and have to go off by myself and think about things. I know people complain that the Tiffany Aching books are a bit didactic, or a bit obvious, but I think it's more complicated than that. It's like a beloved grandparent sitting you down and telling you his hard-earned wisdom about what it means to be human, and what's good in life. And, depending where you are in your own life, it may all seem rather trivial and obvious (because you're young and you already know everything, duh), or it may seem the old man is telling you the only knowledge worth knowing (because you've been through those fires, you have fought and lost, and earned this selfsame wisdom for your pains). There's an urgency to these latter books, as if he has looked his own mortality in the eye and said, \"Hold on, Death, there's a few last things I want to get off my chest.\" Maybe it's not as elegantly done as when he was younger, but he still just makes my jaw drop with the things he understands, and the depth to which he understands them. He is a thinker after my own heart. I sometimes feel my reading superpower consists in being able to read between the lines, to see the writer behind the writing. I saw Terry Pratchett behind all the witticisms before he started tipping his hand more deliberately. In this particular book, he is transparent in every sentence; he's not even trying to fade into the background. It's sad, and it's lovely, and it felt like one long goodbye. I cried at the end -- and he actually did manage to surprise me, the old fox, which made me cry the more. ...more I Shall Wear Midnight is supposedly that last novel about the young witch from the Chalk, Tiffany. In some ways that knowledge colors the book. Tiffany has done with her education and is back home serving as the Chalk's witch. Sadly, strange things seem to be happening, more than just what happens with an senient cheese named Horace, a lawyer who is frog (but who can be paid in beetles) and the Feegles around. In some ways, the novel feels like a good-bye, if not to the Disc than to Tiffany. This I Shall Wear Midnight is supposedly that last novel about the young witch from the Chalk, Tiffany. In some ways that knowledge colors the book. Tiffany has done with her education and is back home serving as the Chalk's witch. Sadly, strange things seem to be happening, more than just what happens with an senient cheese named Horace, a lawyer who is frog (but who can be paid in beetles) and the Feegles around. In some ways, the novel feels like a good-bye, if not to the Disc than to Tiffany. This makes the novel a little bittersweet in tone. It also isn't quite as tight as Nation or Unseen Academicals . It also feels like Pratchett is showing writers like J.K. Rowling and others that fantasy can be more than just magic. The story takes left turns out points that can be shocking or, to be more extact, might make parents uncomfortable. Yet, considering Pratchett's sheer knowledge about folklore and folktales, it could be said that he is returning fairy tales and fairy stories to thier original purpose. And there does seem to be something deeper in the book than the simple plot. If Nation was about belief and community, then this book too is about community, but also about acceptance. Tiffany's battle in the book isn't just acceptance of others as her as the witch, but also her need to accept what others are. For the long time Disc fan, several loved characters make appearances, including various witches and members of the Watch. The book is a fitting conclusion to the Tiffany sub-series. It has been a pleasure watching her grow up. ...more Sometimes I feel like there's not enough joy left in the world. Then Sir Pratchett publishes another gem like this, and it makes me feel better. Tiffany Aching is 16. In a world that looks a lot like our 19th century, that's taking the 'young' out of Young Adult. This is a book with genuine terror, truly adult situations, and more joy and laughter than you'll find almost anywhere.

Then Sir Pratchett publishes another gem like this, and it makes me feel better. Tiffany Aching is 16. In a world that looks a lot like our 19th century, that's taking the 'young' out of Young Adult. This is a book with genuine terror, truly adult situations, and more joy and laughter than you'll find almost anywhere. Tiffany is now the true witch of her Chalk; she's bandaging wounds, helping the old and sick shuffle off their mortal coil, and dealing with viciously abusive parents (not her own). And now, she's woken something truly evil, something that wants to see every witch stoned or burned at the stake. And because she's the kind of person who takes responsibility seriously, she knows she has to deal with it herself. Fortunately for her the Nac Mac Feegle take few things seriously, and that includes their promises not to help. We get to see a number of fan favorites; the City Watch makes an appearance, the first female wizard sticks her head up again, and Wee Mad Arthur discovers his roots. The book started a bit slow--or if not slow, like some of the language wasn't quite doing the story justice. But then it rockets along, and the true masterpiece it is starts to shine through. If you've got an 8 or 10 yr old who loves the Tiffany Aching stories, I'd wait a couple years before introducing them to this one; teen pregnancy, attempted suicides, murderers, and a truly terrifying villain without redeeming qualities might be too much for them to handle. But you owe it to yourself to read this book, and see how Tiffany's story comes to an end. It's almost perfect. ...more Me ha encantado y se me ha hecho cort\u00edsimo. Al leer el ep\u00edlogo casi se me han saltado unas lagrimillas y es que me ha dado la impresi\u00f3n como que Pratchett se estaba despidiendo ya del personaje de Tiffany, como si supiese que ese iba a ser el \u00faltimo libro que iba a escribir sobre ella y me ha dado mucha mucha pena :(( Por otro lado el t\u00edtulo me parece precioso y m\u00e1s cuando conoces su verdadero significado al decir Tiffany que \"cuando sea vieja se vestir\u00e1 de medianoche\". 4 1/2 stars. My objection to teenage marriage, even in a pseudo-18th century fantasyland, prevents me from finding this book perfect. But it's close. I stalled a bit in getting to this one because it's the last of the Tiffany Aching books, and I hate to see a good thing end (even though I can re-read the books at my leisure).

Tiffany, as I've said in previous reviews, is a wonderful character. She's a far better person than I am, but somehow I relate to her--in part because she continually ends up with the fuzzy end of the lollipop. But she always rises to the challenge. She's book-smart and clever, she's resourceful, she's generally kind even when she doesn't feel it inside. She's fantastically human and wonderfully witchy. She takes on all the less glamourous aspects of being a witch (being doctor, nurse, midwife, counselor, and mortician, among other things) in stride; and sometimes she gets to do a fancy bit of magic. Anyone who's read and loved the Harry Potter books needs to read the Tiffany Aching books. She can stand toe-to-toe with Hermione Granger and never blink...and she'd be her friend, too. Pratchett has a true gift for portraying three-dimensional female characters. He doesn't stoop to easy stereotypes and catty female rivalry. In this book in particular, I liked how Tiffany and Letitia come to understand each other and how Tiffany and Mrs. Proust deal with the Duchess. I enjoyed the appearances by other witches from previous books, as well. The Roland situation made me sad at first, but I was made to see that things do work out for the best. Preston is delightful, with his sometimes cleverly concealed cleverness, his curious and word-loving mind, and his loyalty. The Nac Mac Feegle are hilarious as ever, Tiffany's brave and devious allies. The Cunning Man and his mind-poisoning are Tiffany's toughest challenge yet, also calling to mind real-life history. As with Wintersmith , I found myself shedding a few tears when I reached the end of the story, not because it's sad, but because it's beautiful and has such a ring of truth and a life-affirming quality to it--sort of like crying at a graduation or wedding. Although I also wish there could be more Tiffany stories. If you haven't read this series, please try it (starting with The Wee Free Men ). Disregard the \"YA\" label; these books should be on the shelf next to the so-called adult Pratchett books. If you have read them, I hope you agree with me that Terry Pratchett is a literary treasure and a humanist of the first order. ...more I Shall Wear Midnight is Terry Pratchett's final book in the Tiffany Aching series. While clever, thoughtful, and well-constructed, it suffers from the same problem Pratchett has had in his other recent books: he has fallen too much in love with his characters to truly hurt them. Compared to the latent menace that suffused, for example, The Wee Free Men, we never feel here that Tiffany is at any risk that she can't overcome through prodigious application of witch-bourne moxie.

This is a drawback. A number of the other Discworld characters appear, briefly in the book; even antihero-turned-completely-boring Sam Vimes (am I the only person who is tired of him yet?) makes an appearance. I don't mean to sound ungrateful. I realize this is a book for young adults, and so it isn't appropriate to expect the literary equivalent of Werner Herzog. But compared to 2008's superb Nation, also a book for young adults, which was infused with a sense of legitimate dread and danger from the first page, this novel feels more like a cop-out. Where Nation was a gallop on a wild horse, I Shall Wear Midnight was more like a well-constructed carousel: attractive, even pleasant, but not thrilling. I enjoyed I Shall Wear Midnight. I would even recommend it. But that missing fifth star is for what might have been, and isn't. ...more Despite this book supposedly being aimed at younger readers I am sure that there are plenty of us old'uns who have also enjoyed this.

It's barely 11:30!' :D :D Brilliant, funny and highly recommended! :D ...more In much the same way as I grew up with Harry Potter, I have grown up with Tiffany Aching. Though our ages have never exactly matched, neither have mine and Harry's; the true parallel is the level of maturation of the characters, and of the reader, and in both cases those have matched almost exactly.

Though our ages have never exactly matched, neither have mine and Harry's; the true parallel is the level of maturation of the characters, and of the reader, and in both cases those have matched almost exactly. This said, the two are vastly different. If read as commentaries on growing up and becoming an adult, Harry Potter approaches it as an epic quest, full of destiny and the necessity of accepting the inevitable. Tiffany Aching, instead, treats it as something you must work for, something about accepting responsibility- and yes, something a bit stupid and silly at times. Both are true, in my experience; growing up is not something avoidable, and yet is not the be-all and end-all of life. The ability to poke fun at it is essential to not breaking under the pressure it causes. Terry Pratchett, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful man that he is, knows this. His Tiffany is one of my favorite protagonists, I think it's safe to say, and really one of the best-written. She is clever, but she makes mistakes; she is responsible, but strains under tremendous pressure. She, like most young people, thinks she is ready to take on responsibilities normally allocated to adults; and when she realizes that it's not going to be as easy as she had anticipated, she buckles down and works for what she wants. Personally, if I were more like Tiffany, my high school life would be going a lot more smoothly. This book, in particular, is an excellent and satisfactory finale to such a funny, wise quartet. At times a little anvilicious with its message of tolerance, it nevertheless makes it clear that intolerance affects everyone- even the heroine. She must fight for her place on the Chalk, and the battle is not easy, requiring all of her courage, intuition, and cleverness. And, of course, some aid from the Nac Mac Feegles. (CRIVENS!) While I as a reader am sad to see the end of Tiffany's adventures, I feel that I can wave goodbye contentedly, assured that there's more excitement- and twice as much ordinary day-to-day witch's work- in her future. Maybe she will show up in another Discworld novel. Maybe she already has. Having finished this series, I'm now ready to approach Discworld as a whole.

What this book does is to bring out the \"other side\" of the lore surrounding witchcraft. Many of the women historically who were called \"witches\" were actually just women who knew how to use herbs and other things to affect healing and did not mind cleaning up after the dead, getting rid of pests (or putting them to good use-- it all depends). Tiffany is one such woman. Now, I'll grant you, Pratchett's writing meanders quite a bit! I couldn't really follow the plot very well until the 2nd time through. And I am now on my 3rd time through appreciating the plot greatly. You begin to realize that none of Pratchett's words are really wasted, but tie into English folklore, making it humorous, but at the same time really saying something about our culture and heritage. Pratchett's meandering sentences amount to many small Proverbs of folklore which give you cause to chuckle. I was walking around chuckling all day listening to this to the point where people wondered why I was smiling and chuckling so much. Then there's the wonderful new category of people (you know, you had elves and dwarves and then hobbits came along): Feegles! From all I can tell, they are little people with a Scottish heritage, dressed in kilts, but there really only about 3 to 7 inches tall. These little feller's reflect humorously upon many aspects of Scottish clan folklore. All I can say is thank you Mr. Pratchett! I laughed! I cried!

You see, I had not read any of the previous Aching stories, and expected to have that \"walking into the middle of a movie\" feeling. I did not. Pratchett wove the story such that the reader knew there had been previous tales, but wi Terry Pratchett will always be an undisputed master of play on words, wry humor, endearing characters, and non-sequitur hi-jinks, but he also gave me one more pleasant surprise with this book, the fourth of the \"Tiffany Aching\" stories set in his Discworld collection. You see, I had not read any of the previous Aching stories, and expected to have that \"walking into the middle of a movie\" feeling. I did not. Pratchett wove the story such that the reader knew there had been previous tales, but without infodumping or confusing the reader with elements of the previous stories. \"Things happened before; this is where we are now.\" was the feeling I got, and it was wonderful. The plot is a typical runaway chase for finding out \"what's wrong\" and how to fix it. Pratchett is one of the few writers who has ever been able to pull this off without a hitch. His non-sequitur encounters string together like a pearl necklace, bringing in characters from other Discworld stories without feeling contrived or ad-hoc. In short, I highly recommend this and all of the Tiffany Aching stories...and I'll have to go back and start from the beginning now... a pleasant chore. Crivens to all! ...more Tiffany has grown up in this fourth book in the series. She is no longer learning to be a witch, but is the witch of the Chalk. Her home is now her steading and its people her charge. She is the one to take away their pain and heal their hurts, she births them and buries them, she sees wrongs and rights them. Does this come with a lot of rewards and accolades? Nope, sure doesn't.

She is no longer learning to be a witch, but is the witch of the Chalk. Her home is now her steading and its people her charge. She is the one to take away their pain and heal their hurts, she births them and buries them, she sees wrongs and rights them. Does this come with a lot of rewards and accolades? Nope, sure doesn't. The people sort of respect her because she was born there and she is there, but they also kind of look at her sideways. Tiffany is just happy to get used boots and old sheets for bandages. This book centers around two of Tiffany's charges. The first is Amber who was beaten so badly by her father Mr. Petty that she almost dies and her unborn child does die. Now the people of the Chalk can turn a blind eye to a little smack, but when it gets excessive the rough music starts to play and the guilty find themselves gone or reformed or dead. The rough music starts for Mr. Petty and even though Tiffany knows he is bad she still doesn't want the good people of the Chalk to kill him. She whisks Amber away to heal and scares Mr. Petty off. Tiffany has also been taking care of the Baron as he dies. She takes away his pain so that his passing will be peaceful. She has to contend with his small minded, evil nurse however, who doesn't believe in witches and thinks Tiffany is nothing but a thief and liar. When the Baron dies the nurse makes all kinds of accusations, but Tiffany is more concerned about making sure Roland knows his father is gone. Of course this has nothing to do with the fact that Roland is marrying Leticia, a beautiful blond who would never be a witch (until it turns out she is one). It is off to Ankh Morpork, which goes nothing like planned. Tiffany ends up meeting the owner of Boffo's who just happens to be a witch, the Nac Mac Feegles end up destroying a pub, and everyone ends up in jail. During all of this Tiffany is followed by whispers and the whiff of a foul-smelling evil. It turns out the Cunning Man has caught her scent. The Cunning Man was once a witch hunter who was burned alive by a witch. He died, but his spirit remains and infects those around it with doubts and anger and evil. He will suffer no witch to live and is the reason good people go on witch hunts. He is coming after Tiffany now. The people around her start whispering and looking at her in fear and doubt, even Roland who has been her friend starts to doubt her intentions. They start wondering if they really do need a witch and what kinds of evil things witches get up to. It is up to Tiffany to defeat the Cunning Man and she has to do it on her own. Sure she has the senior witches around her, but they are more there to kill her if things go bad than to help her. They would help of course, but they would always look down on her after if she didn't take care of her own problems. This is a much darker book than the previous Tiffany Aching stories. Sure there is the signature Pratchett humor, but it is not as front and center as it has been in other books. Even the Nac Mac Feegles have some serious scenes here. It is really a book with a message. A message about whether you are the job or the job is you. A message about mob mentalities and what it takes to turn decent people evil. A message about friendship and intelligence. A message about not judging people by their looks or their jobs or their families. It was a really interesting book and one I found I had to put down occasionally to think about. I think that is one of the things I am going to miss most about Terry Pratchett. His books are disguised as pure fantasy fun, but they are really commentaries on human nature and the world around us. They make you think even when you don't realize that is what you are doing. ...more", "Title": "I Shall Wear Midnight"},
