Maybe I have been bewitched, compelled, but, when I think of this novel, the word \u2018\u2018masterpiece\u2019\u2019 is the first one that comes to my mind. Historical and fantasy make delightful m\u00e9langes when the two of them are present in a novel. The story may not have been of the same rare quality as Clockwork Angel , for example, but there is something fascinating about those two genres combined nonetheless. Sometimes, there are authors that make us \u2018think\u2019 and try to \u2018convince\u2019 us that their heroine is special when, in fact, she is nothing more than another lucky chick. In this case though, <---C>Ismae</---C> really was one of a kind and the generalisation above does not include <---A>Robin LaFevers</---A> . And, when I say that she appeared different and powerful, I do mean it. For instance, Ismae's body possessed immunition againt poison. No poison on earth was to kill her. Also, she could talk to souls. Needless to say, no body risked outmatching her. Which was not only exciting but also refreshing. I was so tired of whiny heroine that always need their knight in shining armour to rescue them. I saw countless reviewers complaining about the pacing. I am not going to dare say that it was nothing but fast \u2013 since that would be a lie, but, to me, there was no \u2018slowness\u2019 really. And that because 1) I was strongly hooked, 2) enjoyed the writing so much \u2013 very well adapted to the context and century by the way and 3) in every chapter, there was something new, a different scene which made sure that I was never tired of seeing the same characters over and over again or perhaps fear boredom. But, if the story does not appeal to you from the beginning, I am sure you will find this long and endless. She leans forward then, as if eager to tempt me with what Mortain offers. \u2018\u2018If you choose to stay, you will be trained in His arts. You will learn more ways to kill a man than you imagined possible. We will train you in stealth and cunning and all manner of skills that will ensure no man is ever again to threat you.\u2019\u2019 The characters, primary and secondary ones, were not always \u2018unique\u2019 but they had personality! Of course I had read about many duchesses and men plotting marriage for power and wealth, but those personages being included in this plot, along with everything aside \u2013 magic, secrecy and an ounce of mystery \u2013 brought the banal situation of scheming to a new level. And a most unsettling one, may I add, for I had no idea what would happen in the end and who will have to die for the situation to be resolved. One thing I do not seem to read often about is assassins. Not because they are not at the top of my fantasy professions list; it\u2019s just that I do not choose reads in purpose for the story to contain some. If there are, then fantastic! But if none are included, then I will not interrupt my read or skip the book because of it. I admit though that the last assassin book I had read did not appeal to me. It was Midnight Thief and, that one specifically, I stopped reading when I started being annoyed of the romance taking to0 much importance and the heroine risking to go on the path I feared she would take. None of that in this, however! Only fierce, talented and conscious of their missions assassins that might very likely surprise you were featured. And, let\u2019s not forget, they were girls. A lovely plus *wink* *wink*. Why this book was not one hundred percent perfect was due to Gavriel, the love-interest. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the romance had everything I hoped for \u2013 slow-burn, love/hate \u2013 but Gavriel was a little too controlling for my taste. He ordered Ismae around a little too often. I assumed he did not realise he was doing it throughout the story, but it does not change the fact that he could have been looser with her. \u2018\u2018What if I say no?\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Then you will be taken far from here and given to a kind, gentle man in need of a wife.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018If you think I am fit to serve, Reverend Mother, I will do so gladly.\u2019\u2019 If you are a lover of historical + fantasy + romance stories with a religious vibe, then this is the series for you! ...more hooked me with a great premise: medieval nun assassins who serve Saint Mortain, the god of death.

The novel is driven by mystery, romance and subtle skulduggery. It isn't exactly an adventure novel, so don't expect a fight on every page, but if you stick with it, it's well worth reading! I'd recommend it to YA fans, especially those with an interest in history. The closest parallel I can think of is Cashore's Graceling -- another fantastic romance about a deadly heroine. ...more 4.5 stars Absolutely spectacular , and everything you'd expect a historical YA novel about assassin nuns to be.

Perhaps I would have been far less bored if I cared more for fantasy/historical fiction that focuses most of its energy on the romance story. Perhaps I would have been less bored if the romance had been the kind to creep up on you, so that you're inwardly pleading that the characters will get together long before they even acknowledge their attraction for one another. Perhaps. However, the romance was the main player in this book and it was the kind that sprang up immediately and left our heroine instantly breathless every time she saw Mr Duval after their first meeting. I prefer a book that is about more than a bit of romancing, but I'm not immune to a well-told love story either and I can easily be persuaded to award a book at least three stars if I'd been sold on it. Unfortunately, I wasn't. It all happened too soon, too predictably, too obviously. The heroine - Ismae - is a trained assassin that has some serious man issues (with understandable reason), so why can she do nothing but ogle Duval's sexy body in armour when they are in life-threatening situations? The beginning, in my opinion, was the best part of the whole book. A young woman has been scarred since her mother attempted to abort her pregnancy but she survived, and the marque she bears is that of Death's servants. She is rescued away from the beginning of an abusive marriage to be taken to a convent... but these are no ordinary nuns. She is trained as an assassin, taught how to fight, how to create complicated poisons to kill instantly or drag out a death for days. She is the ultimate weapon and she uses her abilities to serve the convent and Death. I cannot deny that this is a wonderful, kickass idea. The problem was that this part at the beginning is the most action-packed of the entire novel. After this, Ismae doesn't use her abilities that much beyond flashing her \"womanly charms\" at the men of court in order to find out information about who Brittany can really trust in these dangerous times when France is out for everything she can get. This book needed a serious injection of badassery. The politics surrounding the issues of Brittany and France in the 1400s could have been much more interesting than it was, except for the fact that it was used as a platform for Ismae and Duval's budding romance. There was too much talking and eaves-dropping on conversations that didn't matter, too much family drama with characters I couldn't give a damn about, too much of all the wrong stuff. Not enough conspiracies, plotting, assassinations (she is an assassin, for pity's sake, was it too much to expect a little more of it?). As much as I like this idea and part of me would like to know how this series progresses, I cannot imagine wanting to put myself through another 500 pages of boredom to find out. And one last thing, I'm sure some of the phrases used in this book weren't around one hundred years ago, never mind six hundred years ago... can't say for sure, I'm no language expert, but it sounded very 20th/21st century for me. ...more 3 1/2 stars I may have a few mixed feelings about this book, but I know exactly who to recommend this to.

Do you love historical mysteries? Court intrigue? Romance? Very light fantasy? Do you love Juliet Marillier? Sherwood Smith? Do you wish that The Queen\u2019s Thief series read a lot more like a romance novel? Then this book is absolutely for you. Ismae is a young teenager when she\u2019s sold in marriage to a much older man. Her father is happy to be rid of her, but her new husband doesn\u2019t know that she bears a large red scar on her back - a scar that marks her as one of Death\u2019s daughters. He is less than pleased (read: murderous with rage) when he discovers the mark, but Ismae is rescued by a hedge priest and bundled off to the convent of St. Mortain, the god of death. Soon she is in training to be a handmaiden of death, skilled in espionage and murder. This book reads a lot like a romance novel, but I really enjoyed that about it. The romance between Ismae and Duval is slow-building, believable, and pretty smoldering. I was a bit surprised when the book finally seemed to be getting to \u201cthe good stuff\u201d and then it pulled one of these: \u201c Sometime later\u2026 Boo. Apparently this is a young adult novel! Which is unfortunate because it reads so much like an adult romance, and I think that it would be better if it embraced that a bit more. My only huge disappointment is that Ismae suffers from what I am now going to refer to as \u201cDriven Snow Syndrome\u201d (because I see this so frequently that it deserves a label): she\u2019s the kind of character who says, \u201cI\u2019m not a normal human being with a sexuality; I\u2019m a woman. \u201d That is, until one special man comes along and then suddenly it\u2019s, \u201cWhat are these FEELINGS that I keep having? Why is my heart pounding? Why are my loins quivering? \u201d She startles like a little bird every time he touches her, and she\u2019s conveniently skipped out on the \u201cwomanly wiles\u201d classes at the convent so she has absolutely no knowledge of what sex is even about. Ladies, isn\u2019t it enough that men have spent centuries pretending that our sexuality doesn\u2019t exist and over-valuing our \u201cpurity?\u201d Do we have to do it too? Come on. It\u2019s also a bit unbelievable that Ismae would be a competent spy/assassin/seductress, and yet have no knowledge of court etiquette, social nuance, or male-female interaction. Not to mention\u2026she has a giant SCAR. How is she supposed to insinuate herself at court as someone\u2019s mistress if she can\u2019t undress in front of anyone? Still, Ismae completely charmed me. I love her snap decision making and wild leaps of tangled logic. I love her awakening and growth as a person. I love that she\u2019ll dangle out of a window to eavesdrop on someone. I also really love the mythology: the god of death and all his forms\u2026the convent of assassins , for god\u2019s sake! I love that I had some serious doubts about Ismae\u2019s \u201ccalling\u201d and she addressed every single one. I\u2019ll definitely be reading the companion novels as they come out!

A badass premise like that is just begging to be read and loved. So what in heaven's name went wrong for me? Why am I only giving this book 2.5 stars? Well, I'll start with what I actually liked first. I did like all the characters, especially Ismae. It's a big deal for me to like the heroine since I usually hate them due to their inability to use their brains. But not Ismae, she's a smart cookie. This isn't shocking since I'd wager it does require a certain amount of neurons to assassinate someone. And while she does carry prejudices against men due to her harsh childhood, there is a good amount of character growth for her. So, gold star for her. Duval, the love interest, while initially not appealing to my co-blogger, won me over fairly easily. And for all those wondering, the \"His\" in \"His Fair Assassin\" is not referring to Duval. It refers to Ismae's god, Mortain. At least, I'm pretty sure. Lol. I also really liked the plot and the historic features. I can tell LaFevers did lot of research and it truly does show. Many of the characters in the novel are real people and the events occurring, real events. I felt it was a nice change in pace to the usual YA books I've read. But the good points just weren't enough for me to love this book. Unfortunately, the negatives outweigh the positives. *sigh* Another book falls short of badassery. First of all, I probably would never have picked up this book on my own if Kennedy hadn't suggested a read-a-long. I choose to avoid historic fiction for a myriad of reasons, the most important being: It's just not my cup of tea. When I have to sit down and think about the setting, time period, a huge cast of characters I have to keep up with, political talk, yada, yada, yada... it just turns me right off. It's too much. And I don't like having to concentrate while reading for enjoyment. In this case, I liked it, but then, I didn't like it. For the first portion of the novel, I was unsure of *when* in history this book took place. Personally, I cannot sit back and enjoy a novel if it feels like I'm missing a crucial part of the story. And the time period was important for me. European history is just not my forte, so I took to Wikipedia looking for answers. Unfortunately for me, I now knew how the story would eventually end unless Levers decided to deviate from history. But at least I knew the time period is the late 1480s. Yay for me. Boo that I had to work so hard to find the answer. Anyway, that was the first strike. The second? Boredom. Right around 40% the high from the strong beginning began to fade and along with it, my eyelids closed more often then I'd like them too. Ismae is a trained killer, but there wasn't much killing going on. In fact, there was mostly too much talking about the political plans being made to ward of the French from invasion. Honestly, I couldn't care less about any of that. I WANTED BLOOD. Then it got boring. Ismae spent more time talking about all her cool weapons, than using them. She'd go on and on about her poisons and how she could kill someone with this weapon or that poison. I wanted her to take a page from Nike. No excuses, Ismae! *FRUSTRATION* What good is an assassin nun that just wanders the castle?! Do something! Anything. Do the Macarena. Sing a Ke$ha song! But, I was still interested enough to continue on and I'm glad I did, because it started getting interesting. However, that leads me to my forth point... This book was entirely too predictable. Could the bad guy be anymore obvious? LaFevers pretty much dangled him in front of us the entire novel like a carrot, so by the time the main characters goes, \"It was you!\" you're thinking, \"It's about time.\" And that really made me sad because I thought, \"There was no way it can be who I think it is. It's just too easy. There has to be one last plot twist.\" Sadly, there wasn't one and because of that, I think the ending suffered greatly. Speaking of the ending, it felt incredibly rushed to me. All conflicts came to a more or less, hurried happy ending. As soon as the baddie is caught the book has nothing more to do then fall back on its underdeveloped romance between Ismae and Duval. That's not to say I disliked Duval and Ismae. I actually liked both characters a great deal, but together? Not so much. Grave Mercy spent entirely too much time revolving around the mystery and not much time developing the relationship. I think the book needed to make its mind up: Romance or plot. It couldn't have both believably, in this case. *mild spoilers* But the part I really disliked about the book was the scene where Ismae had to purge poison from Duval's body by having sex with him. I was relatively enjoying the book up until that point. When I read that scene I rolled my eyes so hard. I mean, really?! REALLY?! She is a nun assassin and the biggest gift Mortain gives her involves her sexuality? She becomes a human bezoar! Would ya look at that? A woman's body really can be objectified in almost any profession! Awesome. \\(-_-)/ The next book appears to be about Sybella, who I thought would have had a bigger role in this installment. The mystery surrounding the girl was thrown at the reader several times and we are given no information about her assignment. Same goes for Annith's story. I found that incredibly frustrating. I realize this is supposed to be a series and perhaps their stories will be told in the sequels, but leaving those gaps made Grave Mercy seem incomplete. I can't help to think the book would have been stronger as a stand alone novel instead of stretching their stories out over three books. So, will I continue on with this series? At this time, probably not. But I would still recommend it to others looking for a change-up in their usual YA readings, especially those who enjoy historic fiction with romance and a pleasant splash of paranormal.

Do men really have a thing about elbows? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m on board with this new craze. Heroine. OK, I loved Ismae. She was such a fantastic and original character and a fabulous narrator. She is definitely the kind of girl you would ring up if you were in the depths of boy despair and needed someone to shake you out of it because she has these dry observations that were absolutely hilarious. Example: \u201cAre men truly such idiots that they cannot resist two orbs of flesh?\u201d Oh, and did I mention she has bracelets that contain thin wire so she can GAROTTE men who dare to venture into her web of brilliance?! And a headband full of poisonous pearls? AND a knife that fits into her corset?! Yeah, Wonder Woman would be jealous of Ismae\u2019s gadgets. The only thing that annoyed me about Ismae was the way she suddenly forgot that she was amazing whenever Gavriel loped onto the page. Issy (can I call you Issy? No?

Love Interest. Sigh. OK, I\u2019ll be fair. There was so much eye-rolling in the first few chapters that it wasn\u2019t even funny. BUT it did get better\u2026and there were a few scenes that made my Northern heart thaw a little. I think when an author wants a dramatic Jane/Rochy kind of relationship it has to be full-on romantic peril. There has to be moments where the reader is chomping on their nails to find out whether they will get together or not. There were no moments like this and my nails were left intact, which is good because I\u2019ve just painted them a lovely colour. It was so very obvious that these two would get together and it seemed everyone in Brittany (and probably France) could see this, except the two of them. And they are both supposed to intelligent and fiery\u2026 but they sometimes came across as quite dim. But like I said, it got there eventually. I know a lot of people will love the relationship and how it develops\u2026 but I\u2019m cynical and crotchety and I like to whinge. So even though the beginning was ridiculous, it did win me over eventually and it was very sweet in an \u2018Oh, my lord, I just fell into your lap. Whatever shall we do now?\u2019 way. I just could have done with more\u2026 y\u2019know\u2026 *looks over shoulder and lowers voice* sex . It did amuse me, though, to think of the scene in the sequel when Gavriel meets Ismae\u2019s dad. \u201cSo\u2026you\u2019re dating my daughter.\u201d \u201cUm.. yes. I mean no.

You come up with a song that is relevant to a story set in the courts of Brittany in the 13th century. That chorus though, it\u2019s pretty apt. Think about it. Think about it. Boy Angst Scale. 10/10. I think I\u2019ve pretty much covered this in the above sections. There is a lot of simpering moments that seem completely out of character (for both of them). I mean\u2026 it didn\u2019t make me mad\u2026as such. Just a little bit disappointed. But I guess that just shows how much I love Ismae when she was brilliant. Sadness Scale. 8/10.

Does this resemble any of the following? I thought so. I look at the Grave Mercy cover and I see Young Adult. I read the Grave Mercy ebook and I see bullshit. The silence feels thick and awkward to me, but any attempt to make small talk seems equally so. Wondering if he feels it too, I sneak a glance in his direction and am appalled to find him watching me. We both wrench our eyes away, and even though I am no longer looking at him, every part of me is aware of his proximity, of the faint heat coming off his body in the damp autumn air, of the scent- This woman is killing me. How can she be so lifeless?? She\u2019s skipping the best parts. Does it have action? Throw it to the pigs. Is it boring? Put it in the damn book. Make it more difficult for Anzu to finish the damn thing. But of course Anzu is an idiot and will try her best to read it. Ugh! When I look a title like His Fair Assassin I think of - hold on to your seats folks, I\u2019m sure you weren\u2019t expecting this - assassins. A huge surprise there, is it not? So as I was saying, before I rudely interrupted myself, assassins. An assassin is a wicked cool person with amazing murder, stealth and weapon skills who uses them in order to remove certain obstacles that get in the way of their happiness. A book about assassins is supposed to be murder/action/stealth/blood/brains filled. At least in my opinion. It was logical that I would expect this from title. Why it was filled with boring details and lacked action? I have no clue. Which reminds me. Did you guys play the Assassin\u2019s Creed games? Read the books? Am I the only one who smells the theft of many elements from the game? First the Reverend Mother who is a female version of Al Mualim, the covenant is the creed, Ismae is Alta\u00efr. In Assassin\u2019s Creed they get their next target\u2019s name through carrier pigeons, in Grave mercy they use a blind lady who reads it in chicken bones and feathers. The Tears of Mortain have done their job well, for I am certain there is no spark of life burning behind that door. Eagle vision much? What the hell?? At least if it was cool I wouldn\u2019t mind it, but they are running the story. You don\u2019t ruin the Assassin\u2019s Creed story and get to live. Ugh I so much wish the cover had a shirtless dude on it!! Then I wouldn\u2019t have been tempted to read it. ...more Grave Mercy is the improbable tale of an assassin-y murder-nun, Ismae, on a mission to rescue the Duchess of Brittany from a fate worse than death \u2013 a really disgusting old, pervert man.

But this is actually a YA novel, which makes it awkward because it actually reads far more like it should have this cover: Look, you can\u2019t just clean up an historical romance, put it through the wash, cut out all the descriptive sex and relabel it YA. It doesn\u2019t work like that. The result is an Historical Romance without any sex - and you\u2019ve just removed the one reason why I WOULD read a Historical Romance. They tried to do that with that Pirates porn movie. The director loved it so much he cut out the sex and rereleased it as a feature movie. But YOU STILL HAVE A PORN MOVIE! There\u2019s just no three way pirate sex scenes to off-put the fake books, stilted dialogue, ridiculous non-sensical story-lines\u2026 actually, it sounds like I AM describing Pirates of the Carribean \u2013 so let\u2019s just move on. The premise was very interesting and I think the idea was most noteworthy. There\u2019s nothing much to complain about with LaFever\u2019s writing and stylistic choices in that regard. But it\u2019s the plot and the pacing that is its biggest let down. Quite early in this novel we see the plot mostly dry up and the fantasy of a badass killer-nun seems to be unattainable as we\u2019re left with a soggy romance that never feels quite convincing. Certainly, both characters are likable and work well together as a team. But the actual romance is never particularly breathtaking or impassioned. Which would be fine if the movie had more throat-cutting and less awkward moments where the two main characters almost kiss. The mystery is laughably easy to deduce which, for me, just added to a rather average reading fare. I recommend this book to those that like the idea of assassin-nuns without dealing with the mess and teenagers who want a gateway book to the historical romance genre.

Grave Mercy won me over in chapter one and I was unable to put down Ferguson, my Kindle, until I finished it. I always have troubles getting through the middle part of a book, but that was not the case here at all. I stayed up very late to finish it and I didn\u2019t regret it for a second. After being abused for her entire life by her vicious father and then married off at fourteen to an equally vicious husband, Ismae is saved by a hedge priest on her wedding night What a pleasant surprise this was! Grave Mercy won me over in chapter one and I was unable to put down Ferguson, my Kindle, until I finished it. I always have troubles getting through the middle part of a book, but that was not the case here at all. I stayed up very late to finish it and I didn\u2019t regret it for a second. After being abused for her entire life by her vicious father and then married off at fourteen to an equally vicious husband, Ismae is saved by a hedge priest on her wedding night and taken to a convent where she is told that she is a daughter of Mortain, the god of death. She is to be trained to carry out Mortain\u2019s will and kill those he has placed his mark upon. Ismae is reborn in the convent, determined to make the absolute best of the second chance life has given her. She is a good and dedicated student. But when the abbess orders her to go to duchess\u2019 court and do her best to protect her, Ismae is not very comfortable with her orders. At 17, she is highly trained in every skill she might need and she has no trouble killing any traitor the convent tells her to, but the only way to get access to everyone important is by posing as Duval\u2019s mistress, and that is very unsettling. Duval seems to be loyal to the duchess, he is her half-brother after all, but Ismae is under orders to investigate him. It doesn\u2019t matter that she finds him attractive, slightly infuriating, but most of all trustworthy. Mortain\u2019s will always come first. What can be more fun than nuns who turned You shall not murder into You shall murder only those we order you to and You shall not commit adultery into You shall seduce for information, but not for love ? Everyone, including myself, was thrilled by the idea of killer nuns, but that part proved to be just a little bit disappointing because these nuns had very little in common with actual nuns. I expected more conflict between their religion and their actions, but LaFevers chose another direction altogether. I really admired Ismae. Getting to know her was my favorite part of this book. I liked her spirit and her intelligence, and I felt that her actions were pretty consistent, a sure sign of a well-built character. It didn\u2019t take long for her to abandon the victim mentality and accept that she\u2019s the one with the power, and that she earned that power by working hard for three whole years. While I had a lot of fun reading it, Grave Mercy was by no means perfect. People with little patience for political intrigue will probably find themselves bored from time to time, especially around the middle. There is also the small issue of predictability: I knew who the traitor was about ten seconds after he showed up and it left me disappointed because I loved everything else so much. Aside from that, I really wish Duval\u2019s poisoning was handled differently. (I have to be extremely vague here lest I spoil things for some poor, unsuspecting reader, but those of you who have read the book will know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.) I don\u2019t mind what happened at all, I wish there was more of it, but the way it happened, under those circumstances, felt a little like a cop out to me. It\u2019s like the action needed to be justified by a life or death situation, which I thought didn\u2019t fit well with the overall tone of the book. Grave Mercy was much more fun than I expected it to be. I can\u2019t wait to get my hands on the sequel. ...more Five Solid Stars!

My foul and sarcastic mouth will gain me no points in life. ~pbtfff~ If you\u2019re wondering, the answer is an emphatic yes on both points. (1) Yes , each of those lessons were directed at me at some time or another. (2) Yes , I still read romantic bodice rippers while tucked under my covers at night. Come on! What did you expect? :P Now Ismae, the main character of Grave Mercy , on the other hand seemed to have gotten a more well rounded and useful life training in my opinion. She learned from the Saint Mortmain nuns: Stealth and cunning knife combat to bring down a man with a marque of Death. Feminine artistry to lure her victims into a false sense of security. The chemistry of poison making that could kill a man a hundred different ways. Defense moves to escape a chokehold or garrote. If those were the lessons being taught by the nuns I grew up with, I'd like to believe I would not have been such a disappointment. I have to say that prior to starting Grave Mercy I was skeptical about whether I would be able to keep my beliefs and deep seeded convictions about religion and faith enough at bay to enjoy this story. Surprisingly (or maybe not) it wasn\u2019t an issue for me at all. I enjoyed the political backdrop, the killer nuns, the historical time period, the constant intrigue and yes you heard me right... killer nuns. For me, it all blended perfectly to make Grave Mercy a fantastical story. In this book, Ismae escapes the cruelty to her father and the man she is wedded to, and is taken away one night after a brutal beating to Saint Mortmain\u2019s convent. There, she learns the skills to keep her safe from ever being hurt by a man again. After several years of combat training, she has been molded into a perfect assassin and is thrust into the political battle between three countries that fight for power and land, where she must carry out the orders of her convent. However, when the desires of her convent collide with the path of her heart, Ismae is forced to make a choice between executing a command from her convent and doing what she believes in her heart is right. Ismae and Duval were a perfect pair of protags, and their story was filled with enough struggle and romantic tension to keep me glued to the eInk on my reader. I loved how their relationship developed at a slow and deliberate pace. It made their love for one another believable and perfect. Like I said\u2026 FANTASTICAL . It\u2019s books such as Grave Mercy that prove to me time and again that fantasy, when done right, is at the top of my favorite genre list. I\u2019m eagerly anticipating the sequel in this story line as I can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s in store for Sybella.

She has strong opinions and is more than capable of taking care of herself. Well duh, she's assassin!

I do not know how to defend against that.\u201d I was little bit sad that the actual assassin training wasn't quite shown. Ismae's life with the nuns was shortly described and I was hoping to see more of the actual poison and combat training. Nevertheless, the beginning was quite fast-paced. After training, Ismae gets her first assignment which she manages with ease and no questions. But her third task is much harder then even the abbess anticipated. Ismae gets herself in the mids of intrigues and political machinations right at the court of Brittany. She starts to question everyone around her and soon finds out that maybe, the only person whom she can truly trust, is the one convent sent her to spy on - Duval. \u201cI have no better plan, my lord. In truth, I am sorely disappointed in my god\u2019s justice so far.\u201d Duval stares at me a long moment, his eyes bright as if with fever. \u201cPerhaps that is because you mistake death for justice, and they are not the same thing at all.\u201d The middle of this book was a little bit stretched, with lot of intrigue, that you can't be sure whom to trust. The prose is also worth mentioning, as it was absolutely beautiful and well suited the story. AND I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. Grave Mercy has the right amount of romance - Ismae's relationship with Duval is intriguing and amusing from the beginning - blended with political intrigue, court life, poisons and killing. There are also some very interesting secondary characters. -> \u201cGood intentions are only lies the weak tell themselves.

Original Review: This is an interesting YA novel as it is set in the 1400s so it is somewhat historical but at the same time fantasy. There is royal intrigue, plots, strange customs and dangerous women. Ismae has been marked since birth. She is a daughter of death better known as Saint Mortain. Daughters of death it seems are beautiful and have some other worldly qualities to them. Ismae\u2019s special talent is with poison she is immune to it in all forms. She is saved from an arranged marriage and sent to a convent for daughters of Mortain. There she is educated and trained to be a deadly assassin for Mortain\u2019s bidding. After years in the convent the time had finally come be sent on her first assignment. She killed a man that might have repented his past transgressions and was trying to clear his name for Brittany (the country not the girl). To figure out who is plotting against Brittany she must set off to court with Gavriel Duval where she can use her gifts to assess who is plotting against Brittany and the Duchess Anne. I liked that there were complex characters in this novel. No one was all good or all bad. Even our heroine is sorely misunderstood. She can tell when someone is about to die or sense them after they have died. Even she doesn\u2019t understand the scope of her gifts. But she is feared as death is feared. Gavriel too is complex dutiful to the core but sometimes he goes against the norm for what he thinks is right even if it brands him a traitor to his sworn saint. The romance that eventually grows between them is sweet and takes its time to blossom. He sees Ismae for who and what she truly is and never tries to change her. I felt so bad for Anne, she has to marry to make an alliance to keep her kingdom that is on the brink of war but some of her suitors are treacherous and if wed she will surely die soon after so they can control her kingdom. The story was so interesting and watching Ismae grow into a bold woman was fascinating. I loved how she came to better understand Mortain and the two sides of him better throughout the book to realize possibly that being an assassin was not all he wanted for his daughters. There were some great nail biting moments and honestly after the first 100 pages I just couldn\u2019t put it down.

Duval was interesting as well, but I never really felt as if the reader really got to know him. The relationship between him and Ismae could technically be filed under slow-build, but it felt forced to me. I wish more time had been spent building their relationship because it very much felt like it went from \"I can't trust you\" to \"We will do our best to be together in the future\" in a matter of 50 pages or so.

The book also promoted important aspects such as to think for yourself, second chances, and first impressions are not always correct. All very important themes for a ya novel. I am very excited to read Sybella's book next, I feel like she would be an incredibly interesting character.

To be bored to death. And yet, strangely, the biggest - only one? - compliment I can offer it is the fact it was so compulsively readable. Weird right? \u25ba First of all, how can we not be interested in the original concept on which Grave Mercy relies? Undeniably, what could be more fascinating than the discovery of the daughters of Death, more known as St Mortain's nouns, whose purpose is to learn an incredible amount of ways to be a deadly assassin? Tell me? Therefore I wasn't bored, but interested, hooked, even - political calculations always draw me in, and I must confess that the settings immensely pleased me. As a great fan of Dumas, I always had a soft spot for intrigues taking place at Court, especially when the Kings aren't the most famous (please stop talking about Louis XIV and Henri IV, not to mention Louis XVI). Indeed there're so many periods which have not yet been explored by the literature! However, I'm sorry, but what was this obvious twist? For real, I was waiting and waiting and waiting for the characters to get to the same conclusion as me and Oh. My . They took their time for sure. As a result, I can't say that the mystery was compelling . Indeed while the writing, the details of the political complots enthralled me, I didn't care much about the big revelation of the villains' identity, for it was pretty obvious since the beginning. Moreover, I couldn't help but notice the lack of accuracy in the historical facts - I don't know if that's supposed to be accurate, but in case you're wondering, that's not. Oh, yes, the big events are \"true\", but except from them, every character is pictured in a wrong way. Take Alain d'Albret, for example. Yes he was betrothed to Anne de Bretagne, but he never had 6 wifes (only one, actually). As for Fedrik de Nemours... he didn't exist. And so on . To be fair, even Dumas was known for romanticizing grandly his characters, so I'm not sure that it can be considered as a flaw. I thought I'd point it, anyway, because I'm an History nerd (sorry about that). Finally, why in the world are they travelling via Quimper when they intend to go to Gu\u00e9rande? Seriously, lost enough, aren't you? Okay, I'm annoying. I stop here. Sigh . \u2710 Generally speaking, I quite liked the writing , which was pleasant and flowed smoothly. But then, I must point that I have not the sufficient knowledge to judge if the way the characters speak can be considered as accurate for 1400s (I have to admit that I have many doubts, because it appeared rather modern to me). Now, what I can judge are the mistakes when French language is used. Of course it was rare - Thanks Mortain! - but come on, don't you think that it would be greatly appreciated if, I don't know, some French speaker checked before publishing? There are grammar mistakes ( \"entr\u00e9\" instead of \"entrez\" ) and a weird use of interjections ( \"mais bon\" , in that sentence, doesn't make any sense. At all.) One might argue that I make grammar mistakes in English as well, and it's true (sorry about that). But the fact is, I'm not publishing a book, but writing a review. But let's talk about the characters , shall we? \u25a7 Ismae , who has a special talent for poison, is sent on an assignment in the Gu\u00e9rande court. Her mission? To protect the Duchess, Anne de Bretagne, while unraveling the layers of treason the young ruler faces. In a word : Ismae must use her talent to figure out who is plotting against the duchess, including her closest support, Gavriel Duval. Well, I haven't much to reproach her, to be fair. Indeed I could understand her decisions, and contrary to some (many?) readers I didn't feel like she gave up her mind for the sake of her love for Duval. On the contrary, she thinks before acting, and if she IS long to realize some facts (DUH), I can't say that she's blinded by love, as she wonders why and who and how is right all the freaking time. She didn't trust Gavriel on sight for Mortain's sake! Yet... I didn't care so much about her either. In my opinion her monologues lacked of sincerity and believability, as I often found myself wondering... Who thinks like that ? Every thought is too neat, and I never really felt her struggle , question - I was told so, but never get the feeling, you know? \u25a7 Gavriel , now. He is nice, kind, but has the bad habit to order Ismae around. Yet he is nice. And, you know, he is ... he IS ... Well, okay, mostly dull . \u2665 That's why even if the romance didn't bother me, it never made me swoon either, as I never really saw any chemistry between Ismae and Duval . As the rest of the story, everything felt too mild to me, and no, my heart never missed a beat. Lack of strong feelings indeed. \u25a7 The so-called villains . Yes, so-called , because we are told that they are the villains in this story, but never really shown, or not enough, in my opinion. Take d'Albret, for example. Oh, yes, he seems really disgusting, but what does he really do ? Nothing. To me, the only real villains are Ismae's father and her previous husband. \u25a7 What bothered me the most was the lack of involvement of the secondary characters . Indeed even if they exist , except for the beginning, the other characters fall into the background pretty fast, unfortunately. Personally, I'm eager to learn more about Beast (how awesome is that name, by the way?) and Sybella - Annith I don't care about. \u25ba See, when I weigh the pros and cons.... ... It's pretty obvious that the cons overtake the pros by far. Now, as I did enjoy my reading still, I decided for a three that I can't help but find quite generous.

I\u2019m not a historical fiction fan. Probably because I haven\u2019t read a great book that\u2019s kept me awake and entertained, until I read Grave Mercy . Nun assassins trained in combat, and poisons, and seduction?? Now that\u2019s a book that caught my interest!! This was a well written book. I enjoyed Ismae\u2019s journey into the world of espionage, all set in the country of Brittany. There\u2019s romance in this book, that\u2019s enough to keep all romantics happy. At first it\u2019s obvious they\u2019re falling in love, but the readers know it, and the character doesn\u2019t. Ismae is not your average female protagonist. She\u2019s strong, stubborn and beautiful. And the way she hones her powers to take down a life, amazed me. I enjoyed reading Grave Mercy ! Assassin nuns and girls who are trained by Death itself??

The story. Young girl escapes from unwanted marriage just so she would become professional assassin trained by nuns. Seriously, how can you resist reading something with premise like this? It screams \"girl power\". But there is something that, in my opinion, skyrockets Grave Mercy into \"epic-ness\". Although, it is labeled as young adult, you have a feeling as if this book is \"ageless\". I didn't have usual issues when it comes to young adult fantasy. World building was believable which is a big deal considering that this is a historical fiction. Author herself points out that she had done extensive research and that many of characters are historical figures (including thirteen years old Anne). Fourteenth century is so different from our own time and being a child was a privilege not a basic human right and - as I used to remind my students in many occasions - back then, being teenager meant that you are adult with all responsibilities that come with that. Characters. Ismae, Sybella, Annith, Anne and even those who are supposedly negative characters, are the most amazing women I fantasy I have read about. Strong and opinionated, with enough strength to fight for their believes and, at the same time, like any other human being flawed and tempered. Duval reminded me of Barrons from Fever series by Karen Marie Moning. Man who knows what he needs to do protect those he love, reluctant to let anyone in and, when he finally does, loyal and honest. Saint Mortain. The most intriguing part of the story. I have so many things to say about this, but I won't because that would spoil Grave Mercy for you. I will just say that I was impressed how author put together ancient believes and character development giving us convent full of nuns and young girls who serve Death.

Each is then sent from the convent into the politics of late 1400s Brittany where they find self confidence through love, purpose, and place in society. The writing: rich period color, first person perspective, strong voice, some graphic violence, modest sex scenes, excellent heroic counterparts, complex politics. Close accepting friendship between girls and women, betrayal by adult role models. Grave Mercy is about Ismae, an abused peasant girl, for whom a convent is salvation and her devotion to her god, Death, a redemption and a means to self actualization. Her journey is one of faith ~ learning to define faith for herself, to find faith in others, and to have faith in her own abilities and in love. Ismae is sent into the high politics of the time to unearth betrayal, learning along the way what she must question and who she must become. She is learning about herself as she learns about her world, and what kind of place and path is open to her. \u201cIs that what my life has been? A series of trials to be passed?\u201d \u201cYou come to us well tempered, my child, and it is not in my nature to be sorry for it. It is the well-tempered blade that is the strongest.\u201d Ismae is a gentle almost sweet character, a fish out of water in the best sense, despite her deadly abilities. The romance that develops between her and the man she is supposed to watch is part of her own journey learning to trust not just men but herself: in her heart, in her abilities, and in her judgement. I adored this book. So much so that I entirely forgave it some initial world building and historical exposition. This was front loaded, once through the beginning chapters (to Ismae's first kill and the introduction of the hero) the pace picks up considerably. I wanted more of the assassin training, because I like the school aspect of most books (well, duh, I wrote a whole series about this) but I can understand why it wasn't there (or was cut out). I enjoyed the journey and the characters (even though I didn't personally relate to them) but I liked them both much more as they are set into motion, on the road and into the city and politics. I thought some of the romance was a little much ~ salvation through sex has never been a trope I latch on to myself. However, I wonder if, LaFevers is playing parody with that trope in her connubial culmination, as Ismae literally saves Duval with her body. ...more A history of (paraphrased) reader responses to Grave Mercy .

In fact, I'm almost wary of a popular book if there isn't an ample amount of criticism to temper a mass amount of glowing reviews. So of course, I get to be one of those people who can't come out of the gate with a strong opinion in either direction. I didn't love or hate this book. There were parts that I loved and parts I didn't. I agree with every person who thinks Grave Mercy could have been so much more. This chick was going around and offing people as an agent of Death. I was expecting something a little more epic. \"How does one serve Death?\" I'm also pretty sure that most everyone who's read this picked the selection for the assassin nun thing. Am I right? In all fairness to the story, I don't think an entire book of assassinations would have gone over well. Could the body count have gone up at least a notch or two? Perhaps. But I can't say that Ismae wasn't assassinating anyone either. I weigh the choice that is no choice at all. To be removed from the world of men and trained to kill them, or to be handed to one like a sheep. \"If you think I am fit to serve, Reverend Mother, I will do so gladly.\" The parts that I struggled with (as usual for me) involved the politics and planning. Not unlike how I felt while reading Lies of Locke Lamora , I found myself wanting to skim ahead to the action. It's not that anything was wrong, but I have a mind which tends to wander. If I'm having to wait around for people to come to decisions on things, I drift off into thinking about what I need to cook for dinner. Which I did. We had spaghetti tonight. It was nothing fancy, but I also baked a cake because I had some free time on my hands. See? Mind wandering. The amount of romance was actually perfect for me. I didn't think it was too much or too little. Duval is what made the second half of the book entertaining. Men of mystery and intrigue are always appreciated. The first 25 and last 25% were excellent. It was that pesky middle section which had me struggling to pick the book back up. I'm not sure what could have been done differently but the pacing felt skewed somehow. I hear Sybella's installment (book 2) is quite a bit better, so I will be looking forward to it. Even with some complaints, I still enjoyed watching an assassin nun at work for death, so I'll be heading back to this world at some point. Many of you know that I can't seem to avoid noticing random things in books which make me laugh.

Game of Thrones is one of all-time favorite series. Grave Mercy lacks that spark that holds a reader's interest while secondary characters mill about and talk and scheme. (A few jokes now and then wouldn't hurt.) Ismae wanders around, looking for the marque that signifies divine order to kill, and slowly falls in love with Duval. It's less interesting when that one sentence stretches into 300+ pages. (view spoiler) [It also takes a long time for Ismae to stop trusting the convent. Way too long. I figured it out pages ago and it looks her look dumb when readers have to wait for her to catch up. (hide spoiler) ] But it could just be me.

I mean, yes I know that is not a good description, but basically the main character ran away from her forceced and brutal marriage. As she runs away, she encounters a place called St. Mortain where she meets her Sisters, who serve the God Death himself. He gives them power, strength, wisdom, and makes others fear them. Ismae decides to bow and join, promising Death she will do as she is told and accomplish anything. But when Death was vengeance for Gavriel Duval, Isame can't help but think of a different way to get rid of Duval because apparently, he has stolen her heart. I got nothing though. I met this guy, his name is Gavriel Duval. Gavriel with a V instead of a B. Then I ended up marking it as DNF because it was still boring. The heroine isn't strong and when she arrived to the place where she would be trained, apparently it took her 3 years to be trained and after those 3 years, she was finally given her first assignment and it took her a while to complete it. I think I'm gonna go back to it but maybe some other time because I honestly want to see how this ends and what other assignments Ismae (MC) is given. But other than that, I expect her to at least be a little stronger and be able to kill people with a sword crossbow (thanks Michelle) like she is shown in the cover. For now, this has been nothing but plain boring and nothing has really happened. She was trained, completed her first assignment, and is back to given more training. ...more Grave Mercy is a fantasy novel that feels like historical fiction.

Our heroine is a young woman in 15th Century Brittany who has always been cast in the role of victim, until she is delivered to the Convent of St. Mortain, the God of Death who masquerades as a saint to appease the newer Christian church. Now she is the wolf instead of the prey. Ismae is believed to be the daughter of this god, since she even survived being poisoned in her mother's womb, although she is forever physically scarred by that poison. She seems to be resistant to poisons and heals faster. While Ismae never felt special so much as rejected, when the choice is a life away from an abusive husband, and some agency in her life, she chooses to become a novice in the convent, learning all the many skills of bringing death to those marked by her god. Not long after her first mission, Ismae is sent to masquerade as the mistress of Gavriel Duval, the bastard brother of the young Duchess of Brittany. Her Mother Superior has tasked her with spying on Duval to see if he is faithful to the Duchy. If Mortain marks him for death, she is free to kill him. Instead of growing sure that Duval needs to die, she falls in love with him, one of the few men she has met who is decent and caring to women, when her own father hated and abused her. But love won't be easy when Ismae is surrounded by intrigue and treachery in the young Duchess's court. Will her father guide her aim true in these tortuous waters? I enjoyed this book a lot. While the author doesn't describe every detail of the setting and appearance of the characters, I obtained a very clear picture of what was going on. Better yet, the story simmers with atmosphere, quite Gothic. While this book establishes itself as a historical fiction novel, the paranormal/supernatural vibe teases at the senses. The manner in which Ismae knows that her god has selected a target is quite eerie but doesn't stick out like a sore thumb, because the story fits so naturally in both categories, paranormal and historical fiction. As far as Ismae's character, she is quite admirable. She's incredibly lethal, and I think a large part of her lethality is her quick mind and her observant nature. She makes a very good spy but also a bodyguard because of those skills. I liked seeing the mystery unfold through her eyes. You see that she isn't always unbiased, especially when it comes to men, considering her past painful experiences with men. I did like that her view changes as she comes to realize that not all men are bad and women aren't the superior sex, because they are just as flawed. She also comes to realize that people can use religion of any kind as a tool for power and control, but that doesn't invalidate one's personal faith in their god. While Ismae is very skilled at killing, she's not a killing machine. She has a respect for life and no desire to torture or cause suffering in others. This was necessary for the story to feel right. This reader is fascinated with assassins in literature, but she hates cruel, sadistic acts, and a good assassin should always show self control (or so this fictional assassin connoisseur believes). Grave Mercy is a successful book, in my opinion. While this is slated as a young adult novel, it doesn't feel as though it's trying to talk down or dumb down the story. If anything, it aims for a clean feel, meaning no graphic sexuality or depictions of violence. But this book doesn't need that. The storytelling gives the reader what they would want for a story of this type. The author writes about themes that affect women, especially women in the past. How their lives and choices are restricted due to their sex, and how that impacts nearly every decision they make, even if they are allowed to have that much control over their lives. Ismae is a heroine that a reader can cheer for. A lethal assassin with a supernatural ability who realizes the world is a lot bigger, less cut and dried place than she first assumed. And that love is definitely a possibility for the daughter of death, but her life and her choices are ultimately her own. ...more Update: This is on sale for $0.99 US Amazon 22 OCT 2016 - If you have not read this trilogy and like historical fantasy romance, I HIGHLY recommend this!

With this great main character and exciting plot, I obviously enjoyed it, my problems lay with the historical/political stand-points where I found myself getting confused and disinterested. I have enjoyed historicals in the past, but not being a historical nut, Grave Mercy really had me overwhelmed. I had difficulty keeping up with the characters and their roles in this immense political scandal set in a time I am unfamiliar with. I mean, I am not unintelligent, I could keep up with the main plot points but it affected my ability to truly understand these characters and, thus, develop a connection with them. I kept forgetting their roles in this conspiracy, which in turn, also affected my reactions to the twists; the unraveling of the betrayers was not as affecting as I feel it should have been. It also didn't help that I couldn't easily go back to check the character index with my e-reader. I may have been able to follow more easily if it had been a print copy. With that out of the way, I thoroughly enjoyed everything else. Ismae, the setting, the writing - it's all excellent and I can see why so many are absolutely in love with this title. Ismae is the type of girl everyone loves, and should also fear (if only they knew). She can kill a man in a second, she does as she pleases, and she's highly intelligent. Plus, her being constantly underestimated makes her even more dangerous. I had a blast going into this story with her. She also has a great sense of humor that had me chuckling quite a bit. I found the writing especially wonderful. This is often a big part of why I sometimes can't get into historicals, but LaFevers gives it all a great flow with an easy to follow prose, vivid descriptions, and enchanting dialogue. I especially loved how she wrote the relationship between Ismae and Duval. It starts off as a mutual distrust, and slowly builds into sometimes heart-meltingly sweet. Intrigue, conspiracies, scandals, betrayals - you can find it all inside these 549 pages. It does have an immense amount of historical intrigue so for those who are able to follow this will become positively entranced in this powerful, action packed novel. -- For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads ...more", "Title": "Grave Mercy"},
