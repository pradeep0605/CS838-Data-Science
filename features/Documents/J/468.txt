This thing has gotten completely out of control. I knew it\u2019d be huge when I planned it, but this story has sprawled everywhere. What the hell was I thinking?

I\u2019m not going to have a fan left if I don\u2019t wrap this up well.<---F> Deep breath</---F>. OK, where are we at and what do I need to do to finish this damn thing? * The main story has finally reached 1714 so at least I don\u2019t have to keep flash forwarding to an older Daniel Waterhouse going back to England after leaving Massachusetts. * Daniel is returning to England to try and settle the dispute between <---C>Isaac Newton</---C> and Leibniz over who invented the calculus, but I want him to get wrapped up in political intrigue about who would succeed Queen Anne. * I also want Daniel to lay some of the groundwork for the upcoming Industrial Revolution by getting involved with the invention of an early mining pump. (Side note: The Engine for Raising Water by Fire sounds cool!) * Time to ramp up all this business about the legendary gold of King Solomon. I also need to tie that back to the ageless Enoch Root. That\u2019s my sci-fi element that\u2019ll keep the geeks turning pages in a European historical fiction. * When I left off, Jack Shaftoe was being blackmailed by the king of France to go to England and destroy confidence in the currency being overseen by the new master of the mint, Isaac Newton. But Jack doesn\u2019t know that Isaac is obsessed with King Solomon\u2019s gold and only took the job so that he can get gold from around the world brought to him to find it. And Isaac doesn\u2019t know that his counterfeiting nemesis Jack already has the Solonomic gold. * Eliza is going to have less to do in this one, but I\u2019ll have her increasing her anti-slavery efforts. * I\u2019m going to let Daniel and Isaac Newton play detective when trying to track down Jack by giving some fun history of how people used to have to do their own prosecutions and hire \u2018thief-takers\u2019 to track down criminals. * It\u2019ll be a cool twist late in the book when Daniel goes from hunting criminals to plotting some major criminal projects. * Shit. I\u2019ve also got to work in the stuff about Leibniz and Daniel trying to build a \u2018logic mill\u2019 for Peter the Great in Russia. Can I work the gold into that? Make it so that everyone is trying to get their hands on it? * Some random things I want to include also include a duel between two men fought with cannons instead of pistols,<---M> clockwork phosphorus bombs</---M>, an assault on the Tower of London and a coach chase through the streets. * I also got to give the readers some idea of the fate of the approximately 1137 supporting characters I\u2019ve introduced in this. Damn, I\u2019ve got my work cut out for me. Fortunately, I\u2019m a genius so it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. But I\u2019ll give my fans a break after this. No big giant books with multiple plot lines. Something short and simple. Although I do have this idea for a new language\u2026\u2026 ...more Whew.

Big stuff, deep brain stuff, delayed enlightenment kind stuff. You sit with the book for a while, its ideas wind up fermenting in the bottom of your brain, and much later, while you're in the shower or on the train to work, it hits you: aha! One thing I love about Stephenson's approach to this particular storytelling: his commoner perspective. We never got chapters on the royalty simply because they existed in this storyline \u2014 he skipped the coronation entirely. No, we just got how things looked on the street, in the dungeons, in the libraries, in the salons. It's the Howard Zinn approach to narrative \u2014 a people's fiction. ;-) ...more Sve \u0161to je zapo\u010deto dvije (ili pet) knjiga unazad, ovdje je zaokru\u017eeno i privedeno kraju. malo je vi\u0161e filozofije i metafizike, malo je ograni\u010denija geografija, pa zato dajem \u010detvorku.

The Baroque cycle is a massive, epic, depressingly wide reaching body of creative work which, I believe, has made several well respected fantasy/sci-fi novelists give up and go home.

And while there are a lot of authors who have written large things ( the Lord of the Rings , the Wheel of Time, a Song of Fire and Ice, etc., etc., etc.) most of them at some point get a little bogged down, lose their way, can't keep track of what everyone's doing, or just get so damn large in scope that they write a thousand pages and nothing happens. The Baroque cycle never runs into any of those things. Really it reads kind of like a single 4,000 page novel. And it's so damn clever! Definitely don't read it before reading Cryptonomicon, despite the fact that the story comes first chronologically. There is a damn good reason Stephenson wrote the books in the order he did. For more on this, see the Narnia books. It will take you a long time to read, there will be moments when you just can't believe you read parts of it right, but if you stick with it you will not be disappointed. Personally gauranteed. ...more Well, I'm now officially depressed. I finished reading the Baroque Cycle. To say that I enjoyed reading the series would be to stretch the word \"enjoyed\" to the breaking point. It would be rolling the word \"enjoyed\" off to the juicing room. It would be hanging the word \"enjoyed\" until half dead, and then drawing and quartering the word \"enjoyed\" by four sturdy teams of horses, in the hopes that somewhere in the process \"enjoyed\" would choose to reveal the location of its ringleader, a much more Well, I'm now officially depressed. I finished reading the Baroque Cycle. To say that I enjoyed reading the series would be to stretch the word \"enjoyed\" to the breaking point.

It would be hanging the word \"enjoyed\" until half dead, and then drawing and quartering the word \"enjoyed\" by four sturdy teams of horses, in the hopes that somewhere in the process \"enjoyed\" would choose to reveal the location of its ringleader, a much more powerful verb, more thoroughly capable of conveying the intricacies of the action. One might imagine a brutal member of the Spanish inquisition leaning over the word \"enjoyed\", asking it \"Who taught you these heresies? Was it 'relished'? 'Savored'? Perhaps it was 'adored'?\" Here the inquisitor looks down at his documents, \"My friend Thesaurus suggests that you work for 'cherished'! Is it 'cherished'?!\" Lest I belabor the point a bit too long, I'll suffice to say that the series kept me absolutely enthralled, this last book somehow doing this with greater fervor than its predecessors, and move to the reasons that this was so: 1. What I like to affectionately label \"Holy Shit Moments\". The definition of such a moment is simple: When the moment comes, the audience (in this case, the reader), is likely to exclaim \"Holy shit!\" or some similar outburst. System of the World is full of them, and they are a diverse lot. 2. This book has something for everyone. While perhaps less so than in The Confusion , there were buckles to be swashed. There was much political intrigue. This is true in the pure sense of some truly epic politicking between the Tories and the Whigs, but also in more colloquial Survivor-secret-alliance senses as well. The general trend of scientific and philosophical endeavors continued in this book as well. There's romance, action, mystery, very much in abundance. 3. Rewarding payoffs. You look for these towards the end of a series. Lots of loose ends to be tied up nicely, lots of characters who need their minor (inconsequential?) arcs tied up. Jerks that need to get killed (you hope). This book ties up the series pretty darn flawlessly, with positive resolutions and negative resolutions distributed amongst the various plotlines in generally pleasing ways, albeit at times in predictable ones, if you are familiar with the historical period. 4. Neal Stephenson is very observant, and has a way of utilizing these observations to great effect. A common praise giving to stand up comedians is that \"he's saying what we're all thinking\", due to their ability to point out the oddities of society so well. Stephenson's ability to do so (not always for humorous purposes) is phenomenal. I've already got one person to add the Baroque cycle to their to-read list, and I've got a non good reads user started as well (with two more in the wings). I think this series is right up there with The Game of Thrones and Bridge of Birds now as my go to recommendation. It's that good. Read it. Read it now. (starting with these quotes): \"Mr. Threader was a meat tabula rasa, like the exposed cliff of a roast beef left by the carver's knife\" (p. 18). If you can think of a better way to describe someone as nondescript, I'd like to hear it. \"How many sheep in England? And not just in January 1714, but in all the millennia before? Why had the island not sunk into the sea under the weight of sheep-bones and sheep-teeth? Possibly because their wool was exported--mostly to Holland-- which was in fact sinking into the sea! Q.E.D.\" (p. 20-1). \"All salvaged, not because they had innate value, but because they'd been given to the Royal Society by important people. They'd been kept here just as a young couple keeps the ugly wedding present from the rich aunt\" (p. 64). \"'Its badness is proof of my sincerity,' Roger said modestly. 'If I wrote her an excellent love-poem, it might be said of me, that I had done it only to flaunt my wit'\" (p. 71-2). \"Then he got a look on his face as if he were thinking. Daniel had learned, in his almost seventy years, not to expect much of people who got such looks, because thinking really was something one ought to do all the time\" (p. 168). \"Which only went to show that Englishmen could live anywhere. Condemn an Englishman to hell, and he'd plant a bed of petunias and roll out a nice bowling-green on the brimstone\" (p. 200). \"If Daniel and Pie were close together both in position and velocity, then pie-eating became a practical, and tempting, possibility. If Pie were far asunder from Daniel or moving at a large relative velocity--e.g. being hurled at his face--then its pie-ness was somehow impaired, at least from the Daniel frame of reference\" (p. 457). \"Myself, I am comfortable with the notion that we are Machines made of Meat, and there's no more free will in us than there is in a cuckoo-clock, and that the spirit, soul, or whatever you want to call it, is a faery-tale\" (p. 679). \"But that was one of those errands that, if not achieved in the first twelve hours, would remain undone centuries later. And, as all of this was shewing, the fetching-out of these three items had long since ossified into a ceremony\" (p. 830). \"The Old Testament [reading:] is a length of black grosgrain ribbon that takes him into the type of passage whose sole purpose, in a Christian service, is to demonstrate just how much trouble we would all be in, if we were still Jews\" (p. 833). \"To be hanged bu the neck until dead is one thing; but to be forced to listen to a reading from the Old Testament twice , why, that is not only Unusual but Cruel\" (p. 834). ...more finished the reread of System of the World and I won't add too much beyond what i wrote in 2008 when i first read the series; less flamboyant and mostly following a 67-68 year old Daniel back in England for the momentous year 1714, but with lots of twists and turns and great appearances from Jack and Eliza (review on first read 2008) Superb ending - in all senses of the word - to the Baroque trilogy and a must for people who love historical fiction a la Dumas or D.

The light sf-nal elements of the trilogy disappointed purists, but so what - the modern world which Mr. Stephenson accurately in my opinion claims that started with Newton and Leibniz is as sf-nal and improbable as any sf novel, so this extraordinary description in 3000 pages of that beginning is a masterpiece. And of course we get to say farewell to Jack, Eliza, and all the characters in a true historical romance fashion... ...more I don't even know how to begin to review this trilogy.

Perhaps the first two insta The final book in Neal Stephenson's The Baroque Cycle , The System of the World , did exactly what the conclusion of a long complex tale, inhabited by a lively cast of characters across five continents, should do: it dazzled its reader with a seemingly unending parade of dramatic climaxes, facilitated by the carefully interwoven tales of seemingly disparate individuals. My usual complaint about Stephenson's detail-driven writing does not apply to The System of the World . Perhaps the first two installments were the careful climb to a colossal peak--a climb punctuated by a few enjoyable bumps and turns--so that the final installment could be a thrilling ride through unpredictable twists and the sorts of jolts that make the reader catch his/her breath. Because The System of the World, in spite of its very boring-sounding (but thematically appropriate) title, is really an action-packed thrill ride. (Pardon my abrupt metaphor shift. Wait for it...) The book got very exciting. I do not exaggerate when I tell you that there were moments when I nearly jumped out of my seat like a fan at a Superbowl party, ready to exchange high fives or expletives with the person beside me. It was very disappointing when, at those moments, the only one beside me was my husband, who wasn't watching the game. And it's pointless for me to relate what we all know: just as watching the instant replay of the game-winning touchdown can't produce the excitement of sitting there tensely through every tedious offensive drive before it and THEN watching the receiver just barely keep his toes in the zone, so were my choppy and incomplete explanations of x killing y or b discovering c insufficient to earn me a fellow celebrant. My only recourse was to send excited IMs to my brother, who had read the book, and rush back into reading. I have yet to decide if I'm entirely content with the amount of closure The System of the World provides. It does a somewhat elementary series of the \"Where are they now?\" chapters to supply the reader with sufficient information about the welfare (or unwelfare) of its sprawling cast, but I would have appreciated a bit more emotion. Although perhaps that wasn't Stephenson's intent. Because by the end of the cycle, I felt a bit like Daniel, the Puritan turned natural philosopher turned courtier turned eccentrically wise and baffling elder: exhausted by the journey and unsure about the world it's produced: a world made smaller by far-reaching ships, far-sighted lenses, and far more powerful engines, in which polarizing issues like abolition, international relations, the growth of public media, and fiat currency only seem to be growing larger. \"All human stories are in some sense repetitious, if you boil them down so far. Yet people fall in love... With a particular man or woman, and no one else. Or a woman will have a baby, and love that baby forever... no matter how similar its tale might seem to those of other babies.\" \"There is no sameness . If you looked down upon the world from above, like an albatross, you might phant'sy there was some sameness among the people crowding the land below you. But we are not albatrosses, we see the world from ground level, from within our own bodies, through our own eyes, each with our own frame of reference, which changes as we move about and as others move about us.\" \"There is nothing quite so civilized as to be recognized in public places as the author of books no one has read.\" \"If a want of hope made men desperate, a surfeit of it made them stupid in a wholly other way.\" \"They are all individual souls. This Mobb is a fabrication of minds to lazy to treat them as such.\" ...more My favourite way of describing Neal Stephenson as an author is that his ambition vastly outstrips his talent; and the Baroque Cycle is a good point in case, I think. It is fairly obvious what he wanted to do here (mainly because Pynchon already did it before him) and it is even more blatantly obvious that this is not the chef-d\u2019oeuvre describing the emergence of an age and short-circuiting that age with our present time that Stephenson wants it to be. The first novel, Quicksilver had three protag My favourite way of describing Neal Stephenson as an author is that his ambition vastly outstrips his talent; and the Baroque Cycle is a good point in case, I think. It is fairly obvious what he wanted to do here (mainly because Pynchon already did it before him) and it is even more blatantly obvious that this is not the chef-d\u2019oeuvre describing the emergence of an age and short-circuiting that age with our present time that Stephenson wants it to be. The first novel, Quicksilver had three protagonists, the second, The Confusion , had two of those, Jack and Eliza, with Daniel being mostly relegated to the background; so it is probably no great surprise that in The System of the World we see Daniel take center stage again, with Jack and Eliza moved to the wings. Also, this third novel takes almost exclusively part in England (and most of that in London \u2013 as world-roaming as The Confusion was, so confined is The System of the World ), and generally this is by far the most focused novel of the Baroque Cycle , one could almost call it tightly constructed. But only almost, as this probably would just not be Stephenson if he would not go on long tangents at every occasion that offers itself, culminating towards the end of the novel in a moment-by-moment description of the \u201cTrial of the Pyx\u201d (basically, a test of the validity of British coinage) that rambles on and on and on over hundreds of pages (felt pages \u2013 actually it\u2019s more like several dozen, but still absurdly long). There also is some mumbling about the threatening chaos of quicksilver being contained into a solid system of the world \u2013 a weak and totally unconvincing bit of legerdemain to make readers believe there is some kind of Deeper Meaning at work in the Baroque Cycle rather than a random agglomeration of pointless facts by which of course nobody is taken in. The thing is that you just might get away with piling up heaps of facts and pieces of information in a non-fiction work, but if you want your text to work as a novel, you need to somehow connect that facts in a way that infuses them with significance \u2013 take a look at Moby Dick if you want to see how it\u2019s done properly, or Gravity\u2019s Rainbow (or really anything by Thomas Pynchon who is the supreme master of turning facts into metaphor). Neal Stephenson, on the other hand, just keeps shovelling facts, facts and even more facts into his novels in the hope that they\u2019ll magically cohere into something meaningful \u2013 which of course they don\u2019t. At best, the facts are curious in interesting in themselves, at worst they\u2019re just a heap of boring pedantry that \u2013 except for the, in this case really minor, difference of their being historical rather than made up \u2013 could have comfortably fitted in any of Robert Jordan\u2019s Wheel of Time novels and that only distracts from what remains at heart a rip-roaring adventure story. Thankfully, that heart beats strong enough in The System of the World to make itself felt through all the intellectual waste Stephenson piles on it, and its rhythm is compelling enough to keep the reader turning the pages even when they are filled with tedious descriptions of irrelevant detail. This third novel of the Baroque Cycle is to my taste at least the most entertaining, with two major struggles driving the plot forward \u2013 the rupture between Isaac Newton and Gottfried von Leibniz about the authorship of the calculus which Daniel tries to mediate on one hand, and the struggle between Master of the Mint Newton and master forger Jack Shaftoe in wich Daniel also is involved. It is mainly the second one (no surprise, as Jack plays a central part) which keeps things going and the reader interested as Daniel first hunts down the forger with a group of unlikely investigators (most of which turn out to have \u2013 at least! \u2013 a double agenda) and then once again becomes a mediator trying to unite the opposing factions in a common purpose. We get a big heist (targeting the tower), a duel (with cannons), a wild chase (with coaches) and quite a few colourful and exciting things more. Summing up (or well, repeating my sermon for the umpteenth time), The Baroque Cycle could have been such a wonderful book if it wasn\u2019t for Neal Stephenson\u2019s delusions of grandeur. Someone really should rescue the fun adventure novel hidden in the trilogy by pulling an S. Morgenstern on Stephenson and make an abridgement with just the good parts. ...more http://nhw.livejournal.com/737376.html Any Man, when he shall have completed a Ta\u017fk, be it one which he has a\u017fsigned to Him\u017felf, or an Impo\u017fition from \u017fome external Party, may experience a certain Euphoria.

The Chief Strand of the Narrative concerns the Integrity of the Currency of England, as admini\u017ftered by the Ma\u017fter of the Royal Mint, Sir ISAAC NEWTON; we see much of him, and of other Per\u017fonalities, including Baron VON LEIBNITZ, with whom NEWTON engages in lengthy and unexciting Philo\u017fophick Debate, and (more briefly) the Musician Mr HANDEL, who a\u017fsists in the Slaughter of a Rogue, by U\u017fe of a Violon-Cello as Fatal In\u017ftrument , in a Thrilling Pa\u017fsage.

Daniel Waterhouse has completed his epic trip back a This is the third book in Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle - well, the last three books, since Stephenson actually wrote eight books that made up the cycle which were then published to form a trilogy. Here the majority of the action takes place in London, where virtually all of the protagonists we have been following end up bringing the story to a mighty conclusion. The basic plot is that of a murder mystery, but comprises many other components. Daniel Waterhouse has completed his epic trip back across the Atlantic at the urging of Princess Caroline. She wished him to bring about the reconciliation of those two mighty Philosophers Leibniz and Newton. In the process of which he ends up stumbling across Jack's scheme to debase English currency (which he is being blackmailed into by the King of France and the dastardly Edouard de Gex). Trying to summarise the plot - the many strands and the different events - is difficult without having to repeat what happened in earlier books or flick through many pages trying to remind myself of exactly who Saturn was and why the Tsar of Russia made an appearance. The cast of characters is enormous and it can be difficult to keep them separate at times, although our main characters have become extremely three dimensional. Daniel, Eliza (although she makes a small appearance in this volume), Jack, Isaac Newton, Dappa, Bob Shaftoe, Ravenscar, Princess Caroline, Leibniz - all these characters become beloved and it is of interest to see what happens to all of them. The three volumes as a whole - the Baroque Cycle - are a truly amazing achievement. It is nigh on 3000 pages dense with facts, with ideas, with characters, with exciting escapes and political machinations. We are shown the beginnings of the world system that we know today - with law enforcement, political parties (Whigs and Tories), real estate and, of course, currency. Either this was written as a fact or Stephenson came up with an extremely clever idea in that currency is called such because of the current of money flowing into London, in this case. There are many such moments during all three books, where you marvel at the level of research and detail that has gone into every element of the story. It is interesting that these books are almost always shelved in the fantasy/sci fi section but, barring the presence of Enoch Root and his little procedure (I shall not say more, for fear of spoiling certain things!) they are more historical in nature. One of my disappointments in this and the previous books is the pacing - we can go from thrilling page-turning events into a deep philosophical discourse and this can make the reader grind to a halt. Despite the exciting nature of the plot in general, there were times when I felt as though it was a struggle to read any further, and this is a sad fact when considering that this should be a series read by everyone. It is a classic in the making - or would be, barring the slow and turgid prose at times. Having said that, it didn't do Tolkien any harm and some people may, in fact, find this one of the charming aspects of Stephenson's writing. I am extremely glad that I read this series, but I shall not be embarking on a re-read for many, many years - if at all. However, I do have the notion that the characters and events will niggle and stay with me - the mark of a book that has had a big effect on me. This should have been a five star experience, but I keep it to four stars purely because of the difficulty of the reading. Recommended (with reservations!) ...more The Baroque Cycle as a whole takes a great deal of time to read, and I think I've come to somehow identify with the series as a result. Now I find myself torn between an urge to share this series with everyone and to keep it to myself so that it's not cheapened by becoming a 30 second talk piece on The View (apologies to The View ). I would also be pleased if these books were never turned into a film or television series, though I would of course have to see it if they were. Although I am normall The Baroque Cycle as a whole takes a great deal of time to read, and I think I've come to somehow identify with the series as a result. Now I find myself torn between an urge to share this series with everyone and to keep it to myself so that it's not cheapened by becoming a 30 second talk piece on The View (apologies to The View ). I would also be pleased if these books were never turned into a film or television series, though I would of course have to see it if they were. Although I am normally unconcerned with whether a novel will be remembered in the future, I would be satisfied if The Baroque Cycle is remembered as one of the greatest series to be published at the start of the 21st century. And perhaps it will be. For any historical fiction fan, this trilogy will surely be a rare treat, and Stephenson does a fine job of tying together events that happened in the 1660s in Quicksilver (particularly the Scientific Revolution) with the plot of The System of the World . In The Confusion (my favorite installment), Jack took us around the world while Eliza roamed about France and Germany. Now, we have returned to London and its characters, including Newton, Liebniz, and Daniel Waterhouse. Even Robert Hooke returns, if only in a series of notes. Perhaps this return to beginnings explains why so many readers report that they intend to reread the series after they have finished The System of the World . The voice that Stephenson adopts for this sprawling series may throw some readers off. In a series of novels of about 900 pages each, we might expect Stephenson to get to the point -- that he should write in a way that is clear and concise. He never does. Whenever a similitude can be employed in great detail, it is. However, this is exactly what makes this book a joy to read. The System of the World is the final installment in Neal Stephenon's Baroque Cycle . It is also a way of understanding the Western World that began to emerge during the Enlightenment. I never realized it before, but a lot of authors set their historical fiction in the Victorian Era. I would like to see more fiction published about this time period, which, frankly, is just more fun. Then again, perhaps I'd prefer that it remains with just me and this excellent collection of books, The Baroque Cycle . ...more Baroque Summer 2011 finally ends! In February 2012! It's probably best not to think of these books as three huge tomes, but instead like a longer series of eight normal-sized novels (which the three are divided up into, with the complication that nos. 4 and 5 are told in parallel) or like eight seasons of some well-produced TV show. I wish it had been eight volumes, actually. I never would have been stupid enough to try reading an octology straight through.

I wish it had been eight volumes, actually. I never would have been stupid enough to try reading an octology straight through. Like anything that long, there were great stretches and slogs. I remember some portions vividly. There are some classic Stephensonian digressions that left me in awe of his genius and affirmed his status as my favorite author. Other times I simply had to put these books down just out of weariness. Seemed more appealing to read something else for a bit rather than get pounded with dozens of pages of fictional third-hand political intrigue, especially knowing I had hundreds of pages to go before there would be any resolution. If I'm rating Stephenson's accomplishment in generating 2700 pages of consistently outstanding prose and wit, I give it 10 stars out of 5. The reality is I'm rating the experience of reading these books, and I'm going to settle on 3 out of 5 for the third volume. I just finished this book and couldn't tell you what happened in the last 900 pages. It must have been a lot, right? Why do I remember the other two volumes more vividly? Should I have put this one off for a few years or taken more breaks during reading? Maybe, but that's the problem right there. I think ultimately, the experience here pales in comparison to his other work. ...more In Quicksilver, the first book of the Baroque cycle, it isn't obvious where Stephenson is going. That book is an enjoyable read, to be sure, but I never would have guessed Stephenson's ambition with these novels is to explain how the world we live today came about, where the scientific method rules rather than alchemy, and where money is completely interchangeable, and where finance...well, perhaps that hasn't changed so much, but anyway, where the world we live in came from. More than a simple In Quicksilver, the first book of the Baroque cycle, it isn't obvious where Stephenson is going. That book is an enjoyable read, to be sure, but I never would have guessed Stephenson's ambition with these novels is to explain how the world we live today came about, where the scientific method rules rather than alchemy, and where money is completely interchangeable, and where finance...well, perhaps that hasn't changed so much, but anyway, where the world we live in came from. More than a simple historical fiction, this trilogy is a fun and thought-provoking portrayal of a changing world. Technologically, the past century or so has been a period of great change, but there's a case to be made that the philosophical changes portrayed in the Baroque Cycle are as significant, and perhaps harder won (as changing minds is much, much harder than introducing new technology). There are some slow parts of the books, typically revolving around world-building. Stephenson's descriptions frequently include quite prominently excrement and disease, though that's probably a relatively accurate description of life in a city of that era. The climax of The System of the World is a confrontation between Leibnitz and Newton, in which the two of them discuss, for several pages, the impact of science on the world and, in particular, on belief in God. I found the argument fascinating (probably because I'm a scientist and religious and think about these things myself), not only for the philosophy, but also because Stephenson does such a great job portraying the way these two scientists thought. ...more After nearly three long years of reading these books by Neal Stephenson I have finally completed the final volume.

All told there are nearly 3000 pages of historical fiction, historical fact, irreverent humor, and a bit of science fiction thrown in. I don't have too much to say about the story itself as there is just so much here. Lots of main characters and hundreds of lesser characters, combined with a verbose hi-brow style of writing make these books a viable read only for those who really want to tackle a challenge. Neal Stephenson is one incredibly intelligent human being and he allows his intellect to permeate his prose to such an extent that large parts of these books are almost unreadable. I plowed through them as a \"project.\" That is, I work on them in between other reading with the ultimate goal of just getting through them. I am also a completist and so refused to give up on these books even though I see by reviews that many others did indeed give up on them. I didn't start out planning these as a project but after I got through about 100 pages of the first one, I decided I just couldn't read them in the normal fashion. I would have dumped them. I must say I'm happy that I made it through them but, at the same time, I won't be taking them with me to that proverbial deserted island. ...more well, I like Neal, but like most of his stuff, all three books in this cycle could have used a better editor.

That level of detail is endearing when he is talking code-breaking or operating systems, but the discussion of periwigs lacks glamor. His characters on many levels are extremely profound and complex, except when it comes to their personal relationships. Relationships tend to occur based solely on physical proximity and the authors need to move the story along. This is most evident in the scene in which the protagonist, Daniel is summoned to his best-friend and benefactors house only to find him dead. He died in a sex-bender with his much younger wife. Daniel upon physically moving the corpse is suddenly and inexplicably seduced by the now-widowed younger wife who, overcome with grief at having killed her former husband resumes with Daniel in the same bed. I liked this series and continue to like this author, but this is definitely not on the re-read list. ...more The temptation to two-star this work out of spite was immense, but let's accept it for what it is.

A well-written book by a brilliant writer which proves, nonetheless, disappointing. Stephenson as an excellent but disappointing writer has been the theme of my reviews since - oh, so long ago, my darlings - I began reading him first with the Cryptonomicon and then, in its immediate wake, (or 'aftermath' may here be a better word), headed down the difficult road of reading all three volumes of his Baroque Cycle of which this, thankfully, is the last. In common with its predecessors it is a massive tome, effectively three novels: 'Solomon's Gold'; 'Currency'; and 'The System of the World'. The period is that of 18th-century England, (for the most part), the early Enlightenment period, and with characters touching upon science, philosophy, and politics, it is historically accurate, albeit with some considerable license taken along the way. Given its themes, many of the characters are known to history - Isaac Newton most notably, of whom more later - and the central character through whose eyes we see most of the events is, as in the preceding two novels, one Daniel Waterhouse who qualifies both as a philosopher and as a politician. Before I launch into my criticism, which is going to require at least one more cup of coffee and several cigarettes, it's worth noting that I was led to read 'Cryptonomicon' followed by the Baroque Cycle by another reviewer. Should you be inclined to read them all, I would suggest reversing that. The characters in the Baroque Cycle are the ancestors of those in the 'Cryptonomicon' and, though Stephenson himself in one of his manifestations of the pointlessly annoying doesn't tend to stick with the chronology, I wish I had taken advantage of that fact by at least tackling them in the appropriate order. Right, coffee... cigarette... and perhaps some preparatory shouting at the cat... ... ... and we're off. Want to know the plot? Well, largely, forget it. To my certain memory I started reading this volume when dinosaurs roamed the earth, began the entire Baroque Cycle when the sun was nothing more than a ball of gas still coalescing and yet to ignite, and the Cryptonomicon was tackled in that timeless zone of non-existence just before the Big Bang. It is not that I've failed to tackle long works before. Heavens, my dears, I've read Proust and, unlike most people, I didn't stop with the petite madeleine and then wander around talking about it at great length in an effort to kid everyone I'd read the whole thing. Well okay, Proust is a poor example, that was turgid, but I managed Ayn Rand's 'Atlas Shrugged' and, except for the horrendous political diatribe section, it kept my attention as did Vikram Seth's 'A Suitable Boy', one of the best novels I've ever read, so I can do it my dears, I can do it. The problem with Stephenson is you get the idea he doesn't really want you to, or at least couldn't care less if you do or you don't. If there were an Excellent Writers Who Make Strange And Bloody Annoying Choices Award, I would nominate Stephenson. If I could write like him I wouldn't be talking about piffly things like coffee and cigarettes, I'd be stunning you with my erudition, my intellect and, at times, with a sly, wry humour that would leave you if not stunned, then at least considering the possibility of falling to your knees before me in order to pay homage. Beyond that, he can write intelligent adventure scenes in such a way that you can get into the whole 'Boys Own' mindset without ever feeling you've sacrificed your higher faculties in order to do so. The man is an excellent writer, no doubt about it. However, the work is disordered chronologically across the three volumes, flopping you around the years between the two-to-three novel-length works that are put together to make up each volume, and even within them, (though Stephenson appeared to have grasped the conception of chronology by this, the final volume). Chronology is not Stephenson's only poor choice. To read Stephenson is to submerge oneself into a boundless ocean all-but devoid of islands. If this sounds like a compliment, try swimming the Pacific. I'll give you some parentheses. ... Back? Done it? No fun, was it? Well, that's the Baroque Cycle for you - wave after featureless wave after featureless wave of it all coming at you and forgotten in the passing as you try to struggle your way through the next one. I didn't know where I was half the time. I lost the plot, lost interest in the characters, didn't even know who or what I should be interested in given it may return later and prove significant rather than being some pointless transgression and so, when events and characters did prove to be important, I was lost all over again. I say all-but devoid of islands. Fortunately, there are sections, chapters, developments which provide not only relief in all this interminable swimming, but also underline what this work could have been had Stephenson not made all his strange choices. Doubtless its these Stephenson's fans remember because truly, they are worth remembering, they are more than mere respite from the endless waves. In these scenes - some conversational, some adventurous, some revolving around some intrigue - I was left with the feeling of 'set pieces' entire unto themselves, divorced from the waves around them. The sea may be their broader setting, but these islands are packed with coconuts and monkeys worthy of exploration while the sea itself most assuredly isn't. Unfortunately, these islands aren't worth all the swimming between them. Stephenson's a good writer, but he's not [em]that[/em] good. I doubt anyone could be. Even here, however, Stephenson once again proves himself the master of the poor choice. Consider - classic Stephenson - two poor choices right at the end of the volume which is, remember, the final volume of three, all exceptionally long. Stephenson, quite rightly, allows two of our loose ends amongst many to be tied up with sufficient drama. Indeed, he interweaves them towards the close of the book, and I found myself hastening through each chapter in my desire to see what was happening in the other scene. So it is that we approach the long-awaited climaxes... and in both instances, one with the second-hand reporting of an observer in a few paragraphs, the other with barely a word, the climax itself comes as a wet lettuce. Splat. That's it. That's your lot. Expected drums and cannons? Forget it. I mean, for heaven's sake, why? It's as if Shakespeare had ended 'Romeo and Juliet' not with its closing scenes, but substituting them with 'PS. It didn't work out in the end and they both died anyway.' Such lost opportunities abound in the cycle. Again and again we encounter a familiar character in an unexpected situation and, after a few pages, Stephenson tells us something really great and exciting happened to put them there, but he couldn't be bothered to write it all down. Well, he doesn't actually say that, but that's what I read. Entire adventures are lost in that fashion. For heaven's sake, why? Weren't those the perfect opportunity for a few less waves and a few more islands? The poor choices make for poor characterisation. After a while you just get bored with these people for the most part. I have listened to a passably-dry thirty-minute lecture on Sir Isaac Newton that had me more captivated by the man than I was at any point in the Baroque Cycle and I'm sorry, but that is quite literally true. Which brings us, finally, to Enoch Root. At this point in the review, were I a Stephenson aficionado, I would go glassy-eyed and assume a look of transcendence. Enoch Root is Stephenson's Gandalf. He is either extraordinarily long-lived - his turning up in the 'Cryptonomicon' set some three-hundred years later rather underlines the point - or is actually immortal, though Stephenson never tells us which. And that's symptomatic of the problem. Stephenson tells us pretty much nothing about Root at all. I get the feeling that, somehow, the spirit of Enoch Root is supposed to hang over the Baroque Cycle and 'Cryptonomicon' both, but in reality he's like one of those characters in a play who is listed as 'Second messenger' or 'Cleaning lady'. On the very rare occasion he makes an actual appearance he doesn't seem to do much of anything at all - certainly nothing that couldn't be done my 'Second messenger' or 'Cleaning lady'. That he is occasionally referenced by one of the central characters in awed tones doesn't rescue him from his deserved obscurity, and the one time he's given the story - right at the very beginning of the cycle - he doesn't come across as anything much at all. Later we find out that we've been viewing the world through the eyes of an immortal, but I'm blowed if I could see the kind of perspective I would expect to see flowing out of the mind of such a being. He may as well have been anyone. It's as if Stephenson felt he had to have this bloke just hanging around, even though he didn't belong in a largely realistic and historical novel, out of some strange obligation. Yes, alchemy is one of the themes of the work, but until near the very end it may be readily dismissed as nothing more than a preoccupation of some of the characters given their timezone. Only at the very end does Stephenson say 'Actually, it works', and then so briefly he may as well not have said it at all. It may be that, at some time in the future, some editor may come along and prevail upon Stephenson to permit the cycle to be edited down into its highlight moments, a not inconsiderable volume of islands connected by bridges as interlinked short stories. Such an editor may even prevail upon Stephenson to write some of the unwritten adventures, or to finish those written properly. Were that to happen it would be a volume I'd highly recommend, but as it stands... no, sorry. As it stands, it's one of those 'If you must' reads. A fuss has been caused, you really ought to find out what the fuss is about. If you do, unless you find something I've managed to miss, prepare yourself for the likelihood of disappointment. ...more With this enormous volume, the Baroque Cycle comes to a close. While there is the same kind of speeding up, adding new plot threads and jumping from one set-piece action scene to another that is typical of Stephenson's endings, I thought he actually succeeded at tying everything up in this one. I guess he can do that when he's got an entire epic-length novel in which to end things, as opposed to the fifty pages or so he tends to devote to endings in his stand-alone novels. In this volume, unlike With this enormous volume, the Baroque Cycle comes to a close. While there is the same kind of speeding up, adding new plot threads and jumping from one set-piece action scene to another that is typical of Stephenson's endings, I thought he actually succeeded at tying everything up in this one. I guess he can do that when he's got an entire epic-length novel in which to end things, as opposed to the fifty pages or so he tends to devote to endings in his stand-alone novels. In this volume, unlike its predecessor, the three books blend seamlessly into one another, and the mega-novel reads just like it had all been written at once. (Maybe it was --- it was published first as a three-in-one volume, and only later were the individual books released.) Daniel Waterhouse, the first of the three protagonists to be introduced in Quicksilver , is also the first to show up here. Having been drawn out of his long retirement in Massachusetts by Enoch Root, to try and mediate Newton and Leibniz's decades-long feud over (nominally) the credit for inventing calculus and (ultimately) differences of opinion on cosmology, he has arrived in England, where he is standing in a field that will be the site of an \"Engine for Raising Water by Fire\" (i.e., a steam engine). From there, he goes on to London in the company of a mysterious person named Threader, whose innumerable discreet business transactions with various wealthy townsmen make the trip take far longer than it should. Daniel figures out that Threader deals in the newfangled paper money that Daniel finds so baffling. At the end of this long, meandering trip, something explodes near their coach. Daniel recognizes the flame as that produced by phosphorus, which tells him 1) the explosion was not an accident and 2) whoever made the bomb is an Alchemist. This one simple task that Daniel is given --- get Newton and Leibniz to talk to each other and start working together instead of at cross purposes --- mutates into an imposing snarl of \"side quests\" in RPG parlance: Newton is Master of the Mint, and plagued by a mysterious counterfeiter named Jack the Coiner, whom Daniel ends up helping him hunt down; Leibniz has found a royal patron for his Logic Mill project, and he wants Daniel's help in getting the thing built, as well as giving it raw information to encode. There is also a succession crisis --- Queen Anne is childless, old and sickly, and both her brother James and her cousin George have claimed the throne --- and a criminal investigation for Daniel to embroil himself in. Both of the other protagonists, Jack and Eliza, have entered the story by now: Jack is, of course, Jack the Coiner, working covertly for Louis XIV to undermine Britain's economic power, and Eliza has attached herself to the Hanover court, as she is a close friend of Princess Caroline, whose mother wed George August, who is now one of the claimants to the English throne. Eliza and Daniel are playing for the same team --- Daniel is a Whig, mostly for cultural reasons (he's a Puritan, and there is strong overlap between the Puritans and the Whigs), he's helping Leibniz, whom Eliza also tries to help, and he's helping Newton, whom the Tories are trying to discredit as Master of the Mint. But Jack is working against both of them, which must cause him some internal conflict because he still loves Eliza, though he tries to make himself forget this. Other characters figuring in this volume are Jack's brother Bob Shaftoe, who is still a sergeant in the Queen's (later King's) Own Black Torrent Guards, and who, with his regiment, helps Daniel and Newton raid a castle belonging to a Tory lord where they suspect Jack the Coiner may be hiding, and later takes part in some skirmishes with Tory militiamen. His regiment is also charged with guarding the Pyx, where samples of coins taken from circulation at regular intervals are kept under lock and key, stored until such time as someone high-placed takes it upon himself to have their purity assayed in a Trial of the Pyx. There is also Eliza's handsome and resourceful German-born son, Johann; a Puritan shipbuilder named Nathan Orney, who has some wonderfully arch exchanges with Daniel (they call each other \"Brother Nathan\" and \"Brother Daniel,\" though their feelings for one another are pretty far from brotherly); the huge, one-armed Russian agent provocateur named Yevgeny; the wily Jesuit priest Edouard de Gex, who is in England supervising Jack's sabotage of the English currency; Dappa, who has left Jack's employ for Eliza's, and who has taken up the pen to write articles condemning slavery; and Charles White, an odious person who serves the Viscount Bolingbroke, leader of the Tory faction, and who decides that Dappa, being a black man in England, must be someone's property, so he might as well be his, Charles White's, property. He has Dappa thrown into jail, from whence he directs all his pamphleteering at White personally. Their feud culminates in what may be the most absurd dueling scene this side of Twain's \"The Great French Duel.\" The ending of the book is truly epic: two climaxes build at once, cutting from one to the other. They have been long in coming: they are the Trial of the Pyx and the execution of Jack the Coiner. Stephenson draws them out, longer I think than any other scene in any of the books. But the drawing-out doesn't feel slow at all; it gives those scenes a sense of grandeur and finality. Another thing I loved about the ending of this book --- which, after the two climaxes play out, consists of a series of epilogues showing where each major character ends up --- was its thematic coherence. Toward the middle of the book the title is explained: Princess Caroline is presiding over the reconciliation of Newton and Leibniz, and she tells them she wants them to work together because she senses that a new System of the World, a more rational one guided by science, technology and commerce, was being born, but that it was a fragile one that would require both of their combined efforts to keep on track. She specifically worried that the flowering of science would lead to a withering of Christianity, and she called on both philosophers to try to forestall that. At the end of the book, Daniel is standing in the middle of a mine that has been pumped dry by one of the new steam engines, and he reflects that the new System has succeeded in displacing the old. Throughout the saga, Daniel and Eliza have been instrumental in bringing it forth: Daniel has furthered the cause of Natural Philosophy, and Eliza has championed commerce. Eliza's anti-slavery labors also fall under the rubric of this new System: as Daniel sees it, the machines the new System enables man to build will do the work that slaves used to do, and will render slavery obsolete as well as morally wrong. (I do not think that this is true; I know that slavery has survived the machine age.) Newton seems to have one foot in the old System and one foot in the new; he's the world's pre-eminent Natural Philosopher, and as Master of the Mint he oversees the rationalization of England's economic system, but his great passion is Alchemy. Indeed, he tells Daniel he only took the Mint position to try and get his hands on the fabled Solomonic gold, the gold suffused with the Philosophic Quintessence that makes it heavier than all other gold and that, distilled, hardens into the Philosopher's Stone that grants eternal life. And Jack seems to be entirely a man of the old System, thriving on chaos and unpredictability. Everything he does --- undermining Newton's coinage, trying to have Daniel, Newton or both of them killed, throwing his lot in with the absolutist King Louis XIV, as opposed to the ever-more-republican English government, stealing the Solomonic gold and unleashing it upon the world --- seems opposed to the forces of Reason and Modernity, except that he also exemplifies some very modern values, like individualism and egalitarianism. As King of the Vagabonds, his command of the Mobb, and his appreciation for the Mobb's power and knowledge of its nature, prefigure the modern era when most countries are democracies. And in that way, Jack comes off as the most forward-looking of the characters, seeing the potential of mere peasants to be political actors when Daniel and Eliza are fixated on Kings, Barons, Dukes, Princes and Princesses. Long story short, Neal Stephenson is a genius. I do not doubt I will revisit this series many times. ...more Of the many reasons I do not play chess, the main one is that I\u2019m lousy at strategy.

The Sy Of the many reasons I do not play chess, the main one is that I\u2019m lousy at strategy. I struggle to think more than one or two moves ahead, can\u2019t easily reposition pieces in my mind\u2019s eye, and am hapless when it comes to sniffing out and thwarting my opponent\u2019s battle plan. I\u2019ve had similar troubles trying to follow and parse the machinations of Neal Stephenson\u2019s Baroque Cycle, the first two volumes of which I found to be dense, sprawling, and restrained in their capacity for illumination. The System of the World , however, is a worthy conclusion to this raucous verbal repast. Drawing from the best elements of the previous two books, Stephenson manages to bring seemingly disparate concepts and characters together in a fashion that feels almost magical\u2013\u2013or alchemical. The System of the World \u2019s success is predicated on Stephenson\u2019s decision to put Daniel Waterhouse front and center. Daniel is the heart and mind of this tale, the Logic Mill, the Engine for Raising Water by Fire, the vegetative spirit that animates the beast. Now an old man, Daniel returns to London to complete the task assigned to him way back in the first scenes of Quicksilver \u2013\u2013the reconciliation of long-estranged geniuses Sir Isaac Newton and Wilhelm Gottfried Leibniz. As we expect from Stephenson, Daniel spends most of his time on ancillary pursuits and only touches briefly on this central quest. Fortunately, his other activities prove intriguing and ultimately tie into the larger story, a quality greatly lacking early in the series. The complex shenanigans in which Daniel becomes embroiled are far less interesting than the kind of man he has become. Though I have criticized this series for what I perceive to be its many flaws, I can now say with certainty that Daniel Waterhouse is one of my favorite literary characters, and certainly my favorite from any of Stephenson\u2019s works. He is a midwife of progress, a lesser savant who walks in the shadows of titans even as he dabs the spittle from their chins and gives them that friendly push out the door so they can keep revolutionizing human thought. He is a champion of materialism far ahead of his time, a non-violent anti-authoritarian, and a gentleman scholar. But most of all, he is a man who wants to end his life feeling he has acted in accordance with his principles and done right by those he loved. To follow Daniel through the completion of this journey is more than enough to make up for The System of the World \u2019s shortcomings, which aren\u2019t any more or less egregious than those of the first two volumes. This book\u2019s other main strength is how it throws historical perspective on notions of progress, particularly in terms of money and democracy. Though I happily make use of money and am glad to live in a democracy, I often bemoan my culture\u2019s obsession with monetary gains and my country\u2019s political gridlock, which is the result of a system that values the checking of power over the ability to institute political change by fiat. The System of the World reminded me that, as much as money can be a drag, the history of money is a mixed bag. Yes, it is a tool that the powerful can wield against the poor, but standardized currency also helped dethrone Europe\u2019s aristocracy by creating an ostensibly objective form of value that could be possessed by anyone , not just bluebloods. And when it comes to politics, even a government as obdurate as our current Congress is preferable to the petty disputes and whims of monarchy. Stephenson himself acknowledges that new Systems of thought and governance will be far from perfect, but offers excellent support for the idea that we are headed in the right direction. The conclusion of Jack and Eliza\u2019s story is fitting, but failed to move me the way I thought it might. Jack remains a mysterious and charismatic thorn in the side of powers that be, and Eliza continues to pursue her dream of abolishing slavery. Both characters fade into the background of Daniel\u2019s story, which is fine by me. Given that this is the conclusion of Stephenson\u2019s most ambitious work to date, it seems appropriate to comment on the author\u2019s tendency to fizzle out where more prosaic writers seek climax. Endings are not Stephenson\u2019s strong point, and the final pages of The System of the World , while containing glimpses of poignancy, are rather disappointing. Jack\u2019s storming of the Mint in London, which occurs in the first third of the novel, is more of a traditional climax than the slow unwinding of plots and relationships that follows. The exception is the final confrontation between Newton and Leibniz, which is inconclusive but also comfortingly open-ended. The only point on which the quarrelsome prodigies can agree is that their metaphysical debate will indubitably rage long after they are both dead. I take this non-resolution as Stephenson\u2019s nod to the spirit of ongoing scientific inquiry, a strangely satisfactory end-point for two great fuses on an Infernal Device whose explosive power would resonate for centuries. This book did not please in all the ways I hoped it would, but it did surprise and delight me in ways I couldn't anticipate. Stephenson has made neat work of a very messy buildup. He is a kind of wizard\u2013\u2013or chess master\u2013\u2013and The System of the World spells checkmate.

When Daniel arrives in England he immediately becomes involved in the Whig/Tory politics of Parliament, Various Technologikal Business schemes, plots to hasten the abolition of slavery, and the ongoing war between Newton the Master of the Mint, and Jack the Coiner a french agent trying to destabilize the British currency. This book, along with the others, is written excellently. Complicated concepts are explained magnificently and entertainingly. Furthermore, the narrative form of the dialogue (used to such great effect in the ancient Greek philosophical tradition) is resurrected and reinvigorated in these books. The philosophies of Newton and Leibniz are expressed in discussions such as these, and to excellent effect. Also, the origins of modern finance, currency, and economy are all discussed thoroughly in this book. It was very interesting to read during the recent economic crisis. Neil Stephenson has been criticized for not ending his novels completely enough, and leaving too many loose threads. These books do not leave many (if any) loose threads. Probably because the 3 volumes consist of 8 books in total, he had enough time to start wrapping things up. I definitely thought at various points through out this volume that the last two books spent much time tying up loose ends. I read this book because I started the series. And it was so good, I had to keep going until I was done. ...more I finally finished the Baroque Cycle (after what felt like several decades). Throughout my struggle to finish the 2000+ page trilogy I found myself continually wondering why I was still plowing through. Yes, there were great characters, and yes, Stephenson has an amazing way with dialogue (IMHO one of the best), and he has really captured a time period -- when natural philosophers and pirates were kings. But his long-winded passages often made me begin to skim (not something I am proud of). The I finally finished the Baroque Cycle (after what felt like several decades).

Yes, there were great characters, and yes, Stephenson has an amazing way with dialogue (IMHO one of the best), and he has really captured a time period -- when natural philosophers and pirates were kings. But his long-winded passages often made me begin to skim (not something I am proud of). The vast list of characters (barons, kings, etc.) were impossible to follow. The only way I could possibly recommend this vast tome is if the reader is comfortable reading through parts that make no sense, assuming that they will eventually. While most of the time things did come together in my mind, often balls were left in the air with no final understanding. In fact, several characters vanished altogether from the story, once they had served their purpose. I did get a bit teary at one character's demise, which is a good sign. But in the ending lies no payoff. In fact, there are so many characters that the climax takes 400 pages to wind down just to attempt to tie everyone up. And it is too damn neat. A love story intertwined throughout the book never comes to its proper conclusion (whether positive or negative), but just sort of arrives at a certain point (as if you were watching two ships at impossible ends of the Earth in one moment, and the next they are running in parallel). (sigh) Hundreds of hours of my life have been invested and I am unsure if it was worth it. But it is done and I am glad I have put it behind me and it can sit on my shelf, as it were, until someone is bold enough to borrow... ...more I'm writing one quick review for the whole baroque cycle and pasting it on all three books. My five star reviews reflect the fact that I had a blast reading this stuff and was very sorry that it eventually ended. I'm going to mention a couple of flaws, but what I have to tell you is that these are great books and you should drop everything and read them. Anyway, NS did a cubic shit-ton of research to pull this off, and as you know he is a capable and thorough researcher.

Anyway, NS did a cubic shit-ton of research to pull this off, and as you know he is a capable and thorough researcher. I'm sorry to say that he over-reports the fruits of his research, and there are many little factoids that pop up without serving the narrative. These annoyed me. Also, the high-energy action scenes are cartoony and took me right up the limit of my ability to suspend disbelief. These contrast violently with the sober nature of the other 95% of the story. Didn't bother me, but ymmv and you should know if you're considering jumping in for the long haul. There are many tedious (to me) descriptions of how a certain city is laid out or how certain troops are arrayed strategically that bogged me down before I just started skipping them. In hindsight, I wish that I had known a little more about the royal dynasties involved, the Bourbons, the Oranges, the Stuarts, etc, before reading, because it was hard to catch up while reading. No problems catching up on Catholic/Protestant conflicts, Liebniz, Royal Society stuff, or anything else. Bottom line- great stuff, lots of heady fun, no dinosaurs but it never occured to me to miss them so no stars off. ...more Po prawie 3000 stron przyszed\u0142 niestety czas na rozstanie si\u0119 z bohaterami Cyklu Barokowego, co jak po ka\u017cdej dobrej ksi\u0105\u017cce nie przychodzi lekko, szczeg\u00f3lnie gdy bohaterowie s\u0105 tak genialni jak u Stephensona.

I have always enjoyed Stephenson novels and this series is no exception. For me, in investing time in one of his novels involves concentration and savoring of every word and sentence that this great writer assembles. In the end, it is always rewarding. This series as a whole is fantastic, but a word of advice, continue on when there seems to not be much going on because in the next page or chapter, Stephenson throws a little twist that have\u2019s you wanting more. ...more I was tricked into reading this , but I'm glad because why else would I have started in on this 2700 page trilogy?
