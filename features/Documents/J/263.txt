It makes me feel bad saying this about a book which was clearly inspired by the author's father's own experiences on the Burma death railway. How can you criticise a work that sets out to tell such an horrific story of war and violence? But this book is drowning itself in its own pretentious language. A woman's ear is an invitation to adventure? Give me a break. If the story had been less dressed-up with fancy trimmings, in my opinion it would have been better, had no Man Booker Prize, and sold far fewer copies.<---F> Which is sad, really</---F>. But I guess when you strip it down, <+++>The Narrow Road to the Deep North</+++> is yet another war story with plenty of gore and sadness; it achieves differentiation by waxing poetic about life, love and ears. And: \"He found her nipples wondrous.\" Oh, come on. They. Are. Nipples. They might be a lot of things, but... \"wondrous\"? Forgive me if I'm somewhat skeptical. Or perhaps I'm just jealous and wish I had wondrous nipples; I didn't realise it was something I was missing out on until now. Then there's Dorrigo Evans who, despite the flowery language and metaphors floating around, feels like a Gary Stu worthy of some YA books I've read. I just don't buy into his self-deprecation. He's like one of those people who is humble just so he can wait around to be applauded for being humble. Like he fancies himself as a modern Socrates: \"I know nothing. Therefore I'm more intelligent than you because I know that I know nothing.\" Let's all step out of the way and make room for Dorrigo's lack of ego. The Man Booker Prize is such a huge award that I'm always intrigued by its winners, but I find myself liking them less and less. Whatever they're being judged on is clearly not something I'm looking to read. Oh well, there are thousands of positive reviews of this book if you want to go see why you should love it.

Nothing since Cormac McCarthy\u2019s \u201cThe Road\u201d has shaken me like this \u2014 all the more so because it\u2019s based on recorded history, rather than apocalyptic speculation. A finalist for this year\u2019s Man Booker Prize, \u201cThe Narrow Road to the Deeper North\u201d portrays a singular episode of manic brutality: imperial Japan\u2019s construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in the early 1940s. The British had long investigated this route, but they deemed the jungle impenetrable. Once the Japanese captured Burma, though, its army needed a more efficient resupply route, and so the impossible became possible in just over a year by using some 300,000 people as disposable labor. Flanagan\u2019s late father was a survivor of that atrocity, which took the lives of more than 12,000 Allied prisoners. \u201cI had known for a long time that this was the book I had to write if I was to keep on writing,\u201d Flanagan said recently. \u201cOther novels came and went as I continued to fail to write this one.\u201d Those \u201cother novels\u201d that he refers to so modestly include his 2001 masterpiece, \u201cGould\u2019s Book of Fish,\u201d which also dealt with the unfathomable abuse of prisoners. But the horrors of that story about a 19th-century convict kept in a partially submerged cage in Tasmania were leavened by ribald humor and a style so lush that the sentences seemed to send tendrils off the pages, which were printed in several different colors. \u201cThe Narrow Road to the Deep North\u201d sports none of that dazzling showmanship. Its magic is darker and more subtle, its impact more devastating. Here, Flanagan is writing about events that outstrip surrealism. His quiet, unrelenting style is often unbearably powerful. Not just an enlivened historical documentary or a corrective to Pierre Boulle\u2019s \u201cThe Bridge over the River Kwai,\u201d this is a classic work of war fiction from a world-class writer. The story casts its roving eye on 77-year-old Dr. Dorrigo Evans, a celebrated war hero whose life has been an unsatisfying string of sterile affairs and public honors. He loved a woman once, but tragedy intervened, and since then each new award and commendation only makes Dorrigo feel undeserving and fraudulent. \u201cThe more he was accused of virtue as he grew older, the more he hated it,\u201d Flanagan writes. \u201cVirtue was vanity dressed up and waiting for applause.\u201d Asked to write the introduction to a collection of once-contraband sketches by one of the servicemen imprisoned with him in Siam, he begins to recall the experiences of that hellacious period. Flanagan has always bent time to his art in the most captivating ways. His first novel, \u201cDeath of a River Guide,\u201d played out the history of Tasmania in the few minutes it takes a man to drown. \u201cThe Narrow Road to the Deep North\u201d has a more complex, impressionistic structure as it moves fluidly forward and backward, changing perspectives and locales, keeping us mesmerized but never confused. For many pages, the novel shimmers over the decades of Dorrigo\u2019s life, only flashing on the horrors of war and the ghosts who haunt him. But soon enough, that unspeakable period comes into focus in a series of blistering episodes you will never get out of your mind. As more senior captured officers succumb to disease, Dorrigo finds himself placed in command of 700 sickly prisoners who he \u201cheld, nursed, cajoled, begged, hoodwinked and organised into surviving, whose needs he always put before his own.\u201d (This character bears some resemblance to the Australian war hero Col. Edward \u201cWeary\u201d Dunlop.) The hospital tent, equipped only with rags and saws, is a theater of magical thinking and unfathomable gore. During one operation scene, I confess that I forced my eyes down the page in a blur. What stretches the story beyond the visceral pain it brings to life is the attention paid to these men as individuals, their pettiness and their courage, their acts of betrayal and affection, and their efforts to cling to trappings of civilization no matter how slight or futile. The greatest burden and the one most affectingly portrayed is Dorrigo\u2019s moral conundrum: Every morning he begins bargaining with his Japanese captors, who insist that dying for the emperor is an honor sufficient to raise his men from the \u201cshame\u201d of being captured. Dorrigo must select the healthiest prisoners for that day\u2019s crushing labor. But his men \u2014 \u201clike a muddy bundle of broken sticks\u201d \u2014 are starving, suffering from cholera, and, in the never-ending rain, their ulcer-covered bodies are rotting away. The ceaseless torture described here is strikingly uncreative: no water boarding, no electrodes, nothing from the Dick Cheney Handbook for Liberators. Instead, the prisoners are simply kicked to death or beaten with bamboo poles to bloody mush. Dorrigo must strive to save each one, knowing that, ultimately, he can\u2019t rescue any of them and that their deaths here in the jungle in service to an insane ambition mean nothing and will quickly be forgotten. Among the novel\u2019s most daring strategies is its periodic shift to the Japanese and Korean guards\u2019 points of view \u2014 both during and long after the war. Flanagan pulls us right into the minds of these men raised on emperor worship, trained in a system of ritualized brutality and wholly invested in the necessity of their cause. It\u2019s a harrowing portrayal of the force of culture and the way twisted political logic inflated by religious zeal can render obscene atrocities routine, even necessary. The novel doesn\u2019t exonerate these war criminals, but it forces us to admit that history conspired to place them in a situation where cruelty would thrive, where the natural responses of human kindness and sympathy were short-circuited. And in its final move, the story makes us confront the conundrum of evil men who later become kind and gentle under the cleansing shower of their own denial. How infinite are our ways of absolving ourselves, of rendering our crimes irrelevant, of mitigating the magnitude of others\u2019 pain. Ultimately, though, the tale belongs to Dorrigo, whose heroism is never sufficient to satisfy his own ideals. His ordeal as \u201cpart of a Pharaonic slave system that had at its apex a divine sun king\u201d seems the kind of psychic injury that never heals, but Flanagan insists that the real source of the doctor\u2019s chronic despair is the loss of his one true love. That\u2019s a mystery spun here in prose as haunting and evocative as the haiku by 17th-century Japanese poet Basho that gives this novel its title. No other author draws us into \u201cthe strange, terrible neverendingness of human beings\u201d the way Flanagan does.

The very best books don\u2019t just entertain, uplift or educate us. They enfold us in their world and make us step outside of ourselves and become transformed. And sometimes, if we\u2019re really lucky, they ennoble and affirm us. The Narrow Road to the Deep North is such a book. Once I got past the first 60 or 70 pages, there was no turning back.

They enfold us in their world and make us step outside of ourselves and become transformed. And sometimes, if we\u2019re really lucky, they ennoble and affirm us. The Narrow Road to the Deep North is such a book. Once I got past the first 60 or 70 pages, there was no turning back. I turned the last page marveling at Mr. Flanagan\u2019s skill and agreeing with historian Barbara Tuchman that, \u201cWithout books, history is silent, literature dumb, science cripples, thought and speculation at a standstill.\u201d The Narrow Road is based on an actual event: the building of the Thai-Burma death railway in 1943 by POWs commanded to the Japanese. The title comes from famed haiku poet Matsuo Basho\u2019s most famous work and sets up a truism of the human condition: even those who can admire the concise and exquisite portrayal of life can become the agents of death. The key character, Australian surgeon Dorrigo Evans, is also a study in contradictions: a man called \u201cBig Fella\u201d who protects those under his command from starvation, heinous deceases and senseless dehumanizing while struggling with his own demons. The passages are haunting and heartbreaking: the skeletal bodies covered in their own excretement, the bulging ulcers, the breaking of mind and spirit. Yet Mr. Flanagan does not depict these scenes to shock the reader. Rather, he reveals the senselessness of it all: \u201cNothing endures. Don\u2019t you see? That\u2019s what Kipling meant. Not empires, not memories. We remember nothing. Maybe for a year or two. Maybe most of a life, if we live. Maybe. But then we will die, and who will ever understand any of this?\u201d And later: \u201cFor an instant, he thought he grasped the truth of a terrifying world in which one could not escape horror, in which violence was eternal, the great and only verity, greater than the civilizations it created, greater than any god man worshipped.\u201d Richard Flanagan implies again and again that only books and poems survive. One of the book\u2019s strengths is that it never resorts to \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem.\u201d After depositing us in the midst of hell, he delivers us back to a post-war world where Japanese and POWs alike struggle to justify and endure. The only weakness is an overwrought love affair at the beginning of the book but to Richard Flanagan\u2019s credit, he doesn\u2019t take the easy way out in crafting its culmination. The dedication \u2013 to prisoner san byaku san ju go (335) was so enticing I Googled it, only to find that the prisoner alluded to was actually Richard Flanagan\u2019s father. As he states early on when describing the unofficial national war memorial commemorating the railroad, \u201cThere are no names of the hundreds of thousands who died building the railway\u2026Their names are already forgotten. There is no book for their lost souls. Let them have this fragment.\u201d Richard Flanagan does honor to these unsung heroes. ...more This narrative was magnificent on so many levels.

The novel is about .... what? Life, death, despair, loneliness, love, connection, redemption, poetry. It\u2019s a grim work, centred on the experiences of the Australian prisoners of war who were used as slave labour in the construction of the Thailand-Burma railway during World War II. In writing the novel, Flanagan drew on the experiences of his father, a survivor of that horrific ordeal, and the public life of his central protagonist is clearly inspired by that of the legendary Weary Dunlop . The narrative moves back and forward in time and is mostly from the point of view of Dorrigo Evans, an Australian surgeon whose life is shaped by a love of literature, by an early, passionate affair with his uncle\u2019s wife and by his wartime experiences. There are other perspectives as well: those of fellow prisoners, of Japanese guards, of Evans\u2019 wife and of his lover. The prose is poetic but unflinching in its description of the unspeakable horrors faced by prisoners of war who worked on \u201cthe Line\u201d. This is a grim tale, with few light moments. It\u2019s not an enjoyable book to read, but it is a powerful one. For me, though, the emotional effect of the work came not from developing a connection with the characters, from whom I felt a certain distance, but from the situation they found themselves in. That said, this is a novel which will haunt me for some time. I\u2019ve given it five stars for that reason alone.

So I am clearly the odd one here, left proverbially scratching my head to figure out why my reaction is so divergent from those I usually agree with, and with similar taste for weighty historical fiction. The author is talented, and there are some very powerful lines in the midst of detailed, gritty, historical realism. But there is something missing for me, and as is typically the case when I don't fully connect with a book, it comes down to the characters. While I pitied the characters in this work (it would be hard not to, as they face torture and horror of every description constantly) few of the \"men of the line\" stood out to me distinctly (and even less were likable), and I had a hard time keeping them separate in my mind. Also, I never grew attached to the main characters, and found myself mostly disliking both Dorrigo and Amy. This is a book filled to bursting with ugliness- all the terrible traits of humanity, and all the ways we destroy and degrade and torment each other. It gets incredibly gratuitous at times, and while I don't mind darkness and violence in historical fiction that warrants it, I did feel like the author was trying to use shock value and repulsive, minute detail as a too-easy way to lend power and gravity to the book. There was also something about the style of the writing that struck me as too contrived, like I could feel the author's desperation to be weighty and artsy, like a painting with all the strategic, careful brush stokes but missing something bigger. Some of my favorite books wade just as deep into the horror of human experience ( A Fine Balance comes immediately to mind) but with a complex beauty, too, which (in my humble, and clearly unpopular opinion) renders those works more authentic power and depth. ...more I have mixed feelings about Richard Flanagan\u2019s The Narrow Road To The Deep North , the winner of the 2014 Man Booker Prize. - The book is obviously well-researched - It was inspired by the author\u2019s father\u2019s gruelling experiences as a POW working on the notorious \u201cDeath Railway\u201d during WW2, in which starving and dying prisoners were forced by the Japanese to hack through the Burmese jungle and build a railway from Bangkok to Rangoon - The novel took 12 years to finish.

Touching, right? - It has all the hallmarks of a classy, literary, important work about love, war, good, evil, the endurance of the human spirit, etc. etc.: \u2022 handsome, tasteful cover \u2022 enigmatic quotations (including that hard to remember title!) from poets like Basho, Tennyson and Issa (I had to look that last writer up) that are meant to be deep and meaningful \u2022 multiple shifts (in time and place): our protagonist is a boy remembering light! now he\u2019s an old respected war hero and surgeon who sleeps with anything that breathes; now he\u2019s a young doctor in love, although the woman he\u2019s shtupping is his uncle\u2019s (much younger) wife! now he\u2019s a soldier in Siam/Thailand! now he\u2019s performing gruesome surgery on his fellow soldiers with crude instruments and no sanitation! now, like Schindler (from another Booker Award-winning novel by an Australian), he\u2019s having to choose what prisoners get to live and die; now he\u2019s living with the AFTERMATH OF ALL OF THE ABOVE \u2022 multiple shifts (in perspective): okay, there\u2019s our main protagonist/lover/war hero/conflicted family man, Dorrigo Evans; there\u2019s also his band of soldiers, who sport hearty names like Darky Gardiner, Sheephead Morton and Tiny Middleton and each have one characteristic that makes them stand out; oh yeah, plus we get to see through the beady eyes of the villainous, sadistic Japanese captors and a Korean guard, who of course all turn out to have their own fears and prejudices. How democratic , and, ya know, fair of Flanagan, right? So there\u2019s all of that. And yet... It\u2019s also highly repetitive. The shifts in time at the beginning are more confusing than effective. The characters, even our flawed hero Dorrigo, remain utterly opaque. There doesn\u2019t seem to be anything connecting him and his experiences with anything that happens later. While there are passages of intensity, vigour and simple, almost Hemingwayesque beauty (a late scene in a fish restaurant brought me to tears with its understated power), there are also sections of clunky, overwritten, melodramatic and obvious prose. And some of the descriptions of women are howlingly bad. There\u2019s also something contrived and self-conscious about the novel, as if it were written with a big, prestigious, important movie adaptation in mind: The Australian Patient ? I know I\u2019m in the minority here, and some of the book\u2019s more harrowing scenes will, of course, stay with me. I do recommend the book. And perhaps I\u2019ll revisit it when that inevitable big budget film comes out. ...more When I turned the final page, I was relieved and sad at the same instant; relieved to have finally let the fates of POWs take wings to better skies and sad to not be living an alternate life, altogether.

This exquisite work of Flanagan is so \u201cterrifyingly beautiful\u201d that it redefined both the words for me. I was surprised to find my mind working at two levels. One level drew shudders - the ulcerated limbs, the beri-beri attacks, the cholera ridden bodies, the virulent lashes, the shitty camps, the fatal frostbites; their strangling hold was so difficult to visualize that I found myself keeping the book away several times to just get my hands and mind steady. Knowing somewhere at the back of my mind that this story is weaved with the solid knots of the author\u2019s father\u2019s first-hand experience of war days, didn\u2019t help either. Above all the visualization, there hovered over them, like a nasty black cloud, the victims\u2019 helplessness. Their best efforts, drawn from the deepest wells of reserve, were never enough to buy a single day of comfort. And the cloud was no passing cloud. However the other level drew comfort. \u2018The path to survival was to never give up on the small things.\u2019 The cloud can darken the day but it cannot darken the spirit that throbs inside every heart; that spirit which is connected to a love somewhere. Inspite of the inhuman conditions, the prisoners held the flame of emotions aglow; keeping relationships, dancing madly, forging friendships, sharing heartbreaks, fighting trivial, crying together, helping gladly, nurturing hope and living a parallel life, elsewhere, far away, in their minds. When life comes full circle and the war days are behind, each survivor remembers those days, with a certain tint of fondness since love, courage and friendship can sparkle even in a muck of inhumanity and death. When life is killed everyday yet one wishes to live and when hope is crushed every hour yet one continues to hope, we see the greatest example of human courage. That courage, Flanagan, tenderly places amidst the sheets of this book. ---- For those who are interested, here is an article where Flanagan talks about the story behind this marvelous book. http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/b... I got the link from the review of fellow GR user, Kim whose wonderful review can be found here - https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... ...more From the slurry that are my earliest memories there is a night of pluvial rain out into which my father went. On the road below our house a taxi had come to some form of grief. I remember looking out a window and seeing static car lights. My father came back and reported it was his friend, an old army mate, now cabbie - Ray. In response to my mother's query, he reported that his pal would be okay - given a little time. I knew Ray had been 'on the Railway' during the war, without knowing exactly From the slurry that are my earliest memories there is a night of pluvial rain out into which my father went. On the road below our house a taxi had come to some form of grief. I remember looking out a window and seeing static car lights. My father came back and reported it was his friend, an old army mate, now cabbie - Ray. In response to my mother's query, he reported that his pal would be okay - given a little time. I knew Ray had been 'on the Railway' during the war, without knowing exactly what that meant \u2013 only that he and Dad discussed it over beers. It seems to me that in today's parlance he would have had some form of 'melt down' and parked by our house; he was coming to someone who 'understood' \u2013 my father. It wasn't till later in life that I came to know what being 'on the Railway' meant. To me the railway, in those earlier years, was the one running by the foreshore of our Tasmanian town and back then, in the days of steam, one actually bearing trains carrying passengers hither and thither. Later I knew 'the Railway' was another line far away in the jungles of Asia, the horrors of the building of which were linked to the game-changing conflict that figured so hugely in the life of both my old man and Ray. Nothing of' 'the Railway' ever featured in my father's stories, told to me perched on his knee \u2013 that wasn't part of his war- as were the battles in Palestine and the Western Desert. His yarns were highly sanitised for juvenile consumption. There is, however, nothing sanitised in 'The Narrow Road to the True North'. As I progressed through my pre to mid-teens I became fixated on those 'great adventures' \u2013 World Wars 1 and 11. There was 'Combat' on the tele, with our dominant allies, the GIs, always coming out ahead of those foul, deviant 'Krauts'. Through another source, the public library, I discovered how foul those Germans were \u2013 though not particularly those on the front line. I saw pictures in books of concentrations camps, pictures that gave me the horrors. These did not feature in any of my Dad's stories either. It was then I started to discover the true nature of war. It had little of the American good guys coming to the world's rescue with some micro-assistance from Aussie diggers. It was a hell \u2013 one only had to read of Stalingrad or Iwo Jima to know that. In recent days I have attended the launch by Tim Winton of his new tome 'Eyrie'. The great man will no doubt be a contender for the Miles Franklin with it, but during his talk he genuflected to Richard Flanagan, who, with 'The Narrow Road...', will no doubt be his major competitor. He used the M word to describe it \u2013 Masterpiece. That word came to the lips of Jennifer Byrne on the 'First Tuesday Book Club' as well. Her panelist, the divine Marieke Hardy, informed us that, at another launch, when she went to congratulate Flanagan on the book, all she could do was cry in his presence so deeply was she moved by what she had read. The first act she did on completing the novel was to ring her own father. Could White in his pomp; Kenneally, Alex Miller or even Winton himself produce the burnished word-smithery this author uses in this book? The Tasmanian has honed the words on his pages to a sheen so as to have his desired effect on the reader. They are mesmerising; they are simply unputdownable. His mastery of the vernacular entraps from the get-go and never lets up until the last page is done with. One takes a deep breath as Flanagan beautifully, if not quite happily, ties up the loose ends, then one simply wants to start from the beginning again. There is a symmetry to the whole opus as Flanagan pulls us away from the fecund, oozing passages of horror on 'the Railway', then immerses the reader in it yet again. I knew from his previous offerings, such as 'The Sound of One Hand Clapping' and the exquisite 'Wanting', that this writer has the promise of literary greatness about him, but 'The Road to the Deep North' raises him to another level. It seems all before for him has been moving to this \u2013 this being reportedly twelve years in the making. It will become a seminal Australian epic. Two aspects of the book did surprise. I knew from the pre-publicity that Flanagan was not going to shirk from the utter vileness of the under-resourced, impossible task that befell the slave labourers on the Burma Railway. Its descriptions of the squalid conditions and Japanese cruelty were a test for me \u2013 a good friend couldn't cope and had to skip those pages. I made it through \u2013 but it wasn't pretty. Even in these, though, there is a beauty in the 'mateship' between the men \u2013 a notion that has been somewhat disrespected in recent times. Surely not now after this book. Of course, I was moved to tears by his portrayal of the privations in the middle sections of the book \u2013 it was no surprise to me that I would be. I was forewarned that Flanagan presents the other side as well \u2013 in some cases, if not entirely sympathetically, at least there is an understanding there. There is a Japanese \u2013 and a touch of Korean \u2013 perspective. In doing so \u2013 does he makes it easier to forgive? What I didn't expect was the sheer readability of the thing. It draws the reader in deep \u2013 normal pre-occupations are put aside whilst one devours it. The mind never wanders, causing a reread of paragraphs, one is so immersed. Even though it is not a linear narrative, Flanagan has somehow made it all so seamless. There is real power in the story, not just of the abominations of the jungle camps, but in the parallel magnetism of the affair that is also at the heart of this great Australian novel. As the main protagonist struggles to abide, let alone like, himself, women are drawn to him in the same way as his men were on 'the Railway' A novel of this magnitude would usually take me a couple of weeks to complete what with all the other enjoyable attractions of retirement \u2013 this, though, took precedence and I flew through it in a couple of sittings. I went to see a film very early in the year called 'Armour' \u2013 a story of a hard singular death. That movie has retained a hold on me, not an entirely pleasant one either. I thought there could be no more pitiful going than that old woman's on that movie screen that night. Of course, there are multiple deaths in 'The Narrow Road...' The double one, though, of Darky Gardiner would seemingly be so heart/gut wrenchingly that it would be beyond adjectives \u2013 yet Flanagan seems to find them to do justice to the brutality of it. Jack Rainbow's demise under the surgeon's knife is almost as potent, if that's the right word? Then there's the Japanese fixation on beheading \u2013 how the author describes the tantric of it in the mind of one of his Asian characters in particular makes the skin crawl. It is something seemingly beyond human understanding \u2013 yet Flanagan somehow makes it comprehensible. The character whose war provides the fulcrum for the tale survives and presumably is an amalgam of Arch, the author's own remarkable father, a former 'slave'; as well as the legendary Weary Dunlop. That he had to make it through another test, albeit a briefer one, was also a surprise to me. It was yet another black periods of time in my island's dark history \u2013 the '67 bushfires. These are indelibly etched into the minds of all Tasmanians of my vintage when the hills around where I am sitting now scribing this piece were in the grip of dry-heated, gale driven hellfires. Over sixty lives were lost. It was another Hades altogether that the by now the living legend had to summon the strength to come to terms with. It's the names - the names of his characters that truly, truly grabbed as well \u2013 the range of wonderful appellations were Dickensian in their aptness \u2013 Sheephead Morton; Jimmy Bigelow; Rooster MacNiece; Bonox Baker; the priceless Gallipoli von Kessler. Does a woman's name role off the tongue more sweetly than Amy Mulvaney. No wonder she dominated the great man's mind with a nomenclature like that! She was his uncle's wife; his unquenchable passion, despite a more than suitable, if long suffering, wife in Ella. And finally, is Dorrigo Evans the greatest Australian literary creation this century? ...more \"For an instant he thought he grasped the truth of a terrifying world in which one could not escape horror, in which violence was eternal, the great and only verity, greater than the civilizations it created, greater than any god man worshipped, for it was the only true god.

It was as if man existed only to transmit violence to ensure its domain is eternal. For the world did not change, this violence had always existed and would never be eradicated, men would die under the boot and fists and horror of other men until the end of time, and all human history was a history of violence.\" While reading this powerful novel about the Australian POWs during World War II, I couldn't help but fall victim to the same dark sentiment expressed above. I may switch the television on to the news or read a headline in the newspaper and it does seem to fit. The senseless violence in our own communities or in the world at large \u2013 it seems to be a never-ending cycle. Flanagan rather bluntly depicts the brutality of beatings, starvation, horrific disease and gruesome deaths of the prisoners at the hands of their captors, the Japanese brandishing a wartime mentality and a pride for country in the service of their emperor. Central to this story is Dorrigo Evans, an officer and a surgeon, one who could repeatedly betray his vows of marriage but could never forsake his men. Dorrigo, as a human being, is an obviously flawed character. He doesn't even believe in his own calling to lead men. But, his men put their lives in his hands and never question his rank or his ability. Forced under grueling and unbelievable conditions to build a railway for the Japanese through the rugged landscape of the Asian jungle, the POWs honor Dorrigo with their unwavering respect. He never quite seems to grasp why they do so. \"As if rather than him leading them by example they were leading him through adulation.\" But, this is one key to survival \u2013 finding something or someone in which to believe. Without it, one would undoubtedly give up. But what motivates Dorrigo to survive and carry on with his duties? Well, of course, back home there exists his one true love \u2013 a love that should be out of reach, but not for the ambitions of Dorrigo Evans. Amy will wait for him when he returns from the war\u2026 or won't she? I think perhaps what I found to be the most compelling point of this novel was not the shocking events that we were obligated to witness in the camp itself, but the aftermath of the experience on all those involved, from the Japanese officers to the Korean guards to the Australian prisoners. What did these men feel after the war \u2013 sorrow, joy, guilt, or self-contempt? Would they be able to resume life as usual? Would the captors atone for what they had done to the prisoners? Well, in real life, we would probably see a range of outcomes, and that is exactly what Flanagan so masterfully recounts in these portions of the book. Some would never quite understand the blame placed on them for their crimes against humanity, others would perhaps try to come to terms with their guilt and find peace in the end. The POWs may block the evil from their minds and never turn back; others may never find true happiness again, always searching for it in the wrong places. Some would seek salvation in their family life; others would emotionally neglect their families. I should note here that this novel is not written in a chronological timeframe, but rather with constant shifts in time and also between multiple characters. I have mixed feelings about this approach. In one way I found this to detract a bit from my understanding of the book. I often felt that perhaps I should go back and make sure I didn't miss something important at an earlier point in the book. Since I didn't have all the information up front, could I not have read enough into certain passages at the beginning to take away what Flanagan was trying to say? The prose was far from being cut and dry and maybe I missed some subtlety that initially did not seem to matter. However, the shift in time did help break up some of the more disturbing scenes within these pages. Just when I thought I could read no more of a certain grisly event, the narrative would switch to another time, another person. A little reprieve, if you will. The only other little quibble that I had bears pointing out. At times I felt it was overly dramatic, but in a visual sort of way. Not in a way that added to my understanding of individual motives or to aid with characterization, but in a manner that perhaps was used to increase the shock value a bit. I know others may not agree, as after all this is a book about a harrowing event in history and perhaps should be painted as such. Overall, this book was excellent and one that I would not hesitate to recommend to others, as long as the reader is okay with some of the more graphic passages. I learned a lot about another piece of World War II that I previously knew nothing about, and the author is clearly well-versed on the subject. There are great moments of superb writing and keen insight into the minds of men we would otherwise fail to penetrate. In the end, when pondering life and death and why bad things happen to good people, why people can endure and survive such atrocities, only to later die a meaningless and senseless death, I have to agree with the POW Darky Gardiner's reflection, \"Life wasn't about ideas. Life was a bit about luck. Mostly though, it was a stacked deck. Life was only about getting the next footstep right.\" ...more I cannot find the right word, or even collection of words, to describe Richard Flanagan's THE NARROW ROAD TO THE DEEP NORTH - it is more than \"moving,\" more than \"gut-wrenching,\" more than \"provocative,\" more than \"beautiful.\" All I can really say is that it is a more than worthy winner of the 2014 Man Booker Prize.

And if you are looking for a book that will wring every possible emotion out of you, a book that will not only make you feel but teach you anew the depths to which a story can induce you to feel, this is that book. In fact, I don't say this very often, but this is one of those rare and precious books that I believe everyone in the world should read, especially Australians. As Flanagan says, \"A good book ... leaves you wanting to reread the book. A great book compels you to reread your own soul.\" Focusing on a surgeon, officer, and reluctant war hero called Dorrigo Evans in order to describe the experiences of both Australian POWs and Japanese army servicemen in the construction of the Thai-Burma \"Death Railway\" in 1943, it may seem that it goes without saying that this book is not for the faint-hearted, but that is quite a considerable understatement. So much cruelty, so much pain, so much soul-destroying sadness. There is a particular surgical scene that left me shattered. The author must have had nerves of steel to write this book and a truly driving passion to tell this story. Yet I keep coming back to the thought: As hard as it must have been to write, and as hard as it is to read, how much harder must it have been to live? This story is devastating. Devastating. Yet it is also beautiful - terrible and beautiful - thanks to Flanagan's mastery of his craft. There is a certain \"call-a-spade-a-spade\" pragmatism and forthrightness that is part of the Australian psyche, and this is a constant presence in Flanagan's writing, yet at the same time, the style, language, word usage, and even cadence of his prose is so pure and exquisite that it rivals that of any nationality and even any era. He is a maestro whose art would be among the greats of any time or place. THE NARROW ROAD TO THE DEEP NORTH has a loose structure that is ostensibly based on an elderly Dorrigo reminiscing about his time in the POW camp and the people he knew there, although the book goes off on a few other tangents as well. This device of looking back over a life makes the story feel very fragmented but beautifully so - it is comprised of fragments of great beauty, great pain, and great ordinariness. Thus, in a chronological sense, the story jumps and skitters from one place to another, and Dorrigo constantly belabors the point that he is the most unreliable of narrators. All this is true. This is not a book about the Death Railway, it is a book about people's experiences and memories of the Death Railway and how they live with it. As Dorrigo says, \"A happy man has no past, while an unhappy man has nothing else.\" Occasionally we are told about a prisoner's long future life, but rather than feeling cheated of seeing their story through to the end, I felt the opposite: that this book was not about what happened to the characters in the end, it was about a single thing, the one thing that affected them all. Australian or Japanese, male POW or female lover left behind to fret, they all experienced the Death Railway; and the point is not whether they survived it or not, the point is that they were all there. In this book, there are melancholy accounts of what came after, because they show the futility and sheer bloody wastefulness of what came before. And always in the background is the whispered refrain: \"Lest we forget.\" Its characterization is one of the book's greatest strengths. Dorrigo hates being viewed as a war hero and says that: \"One man's feeling is not always equal to all life is. Sometimes it's not equal to anything much at all.\" And so, there is a sense that Dorrigo's warring emotions of vanity and self-loathing make him turn outward to study other people in a way that provides poignant and fundamental insights into their souls. Or perhaps he has just always been enthralled by people and their uniqueness. Either way, this book is nothing so much as a cavalcade of individual lives and personalities, and the infinite shades of gray they personify. However, despite his attempts to focus on others, or perhaps because of them, Dorrigo himself is the most deeply realized character in the book. He is also an exquisite study in survivor's guilt: \"He understood that he shared certain features, habits and history with the war hero. But he was not him. He'd just had more success at living than at dying ...\" During his time in the camp, as his company's officer as well as surgeon, Dorrigo both found himself and came to hate himself, as so many perfectionists do. \"Dorrigo Evans understood himself as a weak man who was entitled to nothing, a weak man whom the thousand were forming into the shape of their expectations of him as a strong man. It defied sense. They were captives of the Japanese and he was the prisoner of their hope.\" Despite the pressure and duty placed on him by his men, he would \"... come to love them, and every day he understands that he is failing in his love, for every day more and more of them die.\" Yet, \"He refused to stop trying to help them live. He was not a good surgeon, he was not a good doctor; he was not, he believed in his heart, a good man. But he refused to stop trying.\" Dorrigo is forever searching for what makes a person fully human, and he is very much afraid that the perfect mixture of suffering, brutality, and madness found on the Death Railway represents the only time in which man realized his full humanity. This story contains one character in particular, Colonel Kota, who is straight out of the most evil of nightmares. A coolly sadistic, matter-of-fact psychopath, he is a character I will not easily forget, if I ever do: \"Colonel Kota knew he was in the power of something demented, inhuman, that had left a trail of endings through Asia. And the more he killed, so casually, so joyfully, the more he realised his own ending would be the one death beyond his own control. To control the deaths of others - when, where, the craft of ensuring it was a cleanly sliced ending - that was possible. And in some strange way, such killing felt like controlling whatever remained of his own life.\" The sort of character development and depth that takes most authors an entire book to achieve, if they're lucky, Flanagan pulls off in the smallest vignettes, sometimes in just a handful of pages. And it says something about the author's greatness that in this book that is brimming with the vilest hate and prejudice, there is absolutely no bias in the terrible beauty he wrings out of each character, from Dorrigo Evans to Colonel Kota, from Amy Mulvaney to Rooster MacNeice, from \"the Goanna\" to Darky Gardiner. It is abundantly clear that each in turn has received the author's heart and soul, and most likely blood, sweat, and tears, too. Probably the greatest mistake a reader of THE NARROW ROAD TO THE DEEP NORTH can make is to think they know what to expect from it. This very serious-minded book has occasional pieces of sly, wry, ironic humor that are mildly startling for their cropping up in the midst of much graver musings. In the middle of his own self-deprecation, for example, Dorrigo suddenly points out that: \"He had avoided what he regarded as some obvious errors of life, such as politics and golf.\" The laconic Australian humor of the \"diggers\" (Australian soldiers) crackles and sparkles in exquisite one-liners. For some reason, a simple sentence like this really tickled my funny bone: \"It's a good plan, Wat, said Chum Fagan. Only it isn't.\" And who would not smile at a description like this: \"He had the presence of a precarious telegraph pole.\" Something else I never expected to find in the pages of this book was a love affair that was so organic, conflicted, full of confusion and passion and doubt that it was all too devastatingly authentic. The word that most often springs to my mind in relation to THE NARROW ROAD TO THE DEEP NORTH is \"real,\" and Amy Mulvaney and Dorrigo's mad, irresistible, forbidden love is as real as love ever gets. It is also pleasing to find that there is room given in this all-inclusive tale to the women who loved the men we meet in the POW camp, and to the ways in which their hearts broke every bit as painfully and completely as the men's did. And it occurs to me that the path of this story is littered with hearts that have broken not for themselves but for others. There is a strong theme in this book that we can bear whatever happens to us, but what breaks us is seeing it happen to others and being powerless to prevent it. And so, there is, of course, no escaping the fact that the heart of this story is the horror, suffering, and death that stalked the POW camp that supplied the slave labor expended so heedlessly on the construction of the impossible Thai-Burma Railway in the Second World War. These pages are littered with so much death that each incident is included as just one more sentence in the narrative - after all, if every death was given the lamentation it deserved, the book would never end. We have only to encounter and pass over it in a book; the truly sobering thought, of course, is that men just like the ones in this book lived through the reality of it. \"Horror can be contained within a book, given form and meaning. But in life horror has no more form than it does meaning. Horror just is. And while it reigns, it is as if there is nothing in the universe that it is not.\" The story is very effective at portraying the gradual but inexorable breaking down of the POWs' spirit, moving them from defiant larrikinism to every individual conserving their own food and their own strength, yet still looking out for their comrades in suffering. \"Starvation stalked the Australians. It hid in each man's every act and every thought. Against it they could proffer only their Australian wisdom which was really no more than opinions emptier than their bellies. They tried to hold together with their Australian dryness and their Australian curses, their Australian memories and their Australian mateship. But suddenly Australia meant little against lice and hunger and beri-beri, against thieving and beatings and yet ever more slave labour.\" In the end, \"... they together staggered through those days that built like a scream that never ended, a wet, green shriek ...\" Yet they still knew that their only hope of salvation was in unity: \"... courage, survival, love - all these things didn't live in one man. They lived in them all or they died and every man with them; they had come to believe that to abandon one man was to abandon themselves.\" THE NARROW ROAD TO THE DEEP NORTH is realistic fiction based very much on actual events, and as I read of the events of 1946 and later, I was struck forcibly with how closely this work of realistic, historical fiction resembles the best the literary world has to offer in dystopian and post-apocalyptic fiction. At no point in this book does the reader have their hand held or their feelings spared, and the stories of what happened to the survivors of the Death Railway is no exception. When someone returns home from Hell, there can be no happily ever after. This book surprised me at every turn, perhaps none more so than in its narration of the war crimes trials of the Japanese after the war. This material raises some very uncomfortable questions: If the Japanese culture was so different from Western culture that they were literally incapable of seeing their actions toward the POWs as wrong, much less criminal, how culpable were they? If the Japanese army brutalized its own people as a right and proper part of their training, how could these men see brutality meted out to prisoners as wrong? \"The punishment wasn't about guilt but honour. There was no choice in any of this: one existed for the Emperor and for the railway - which was, after all, the embodiment of the Emperor's will - or one had no reason to live or even die.\" Did the fact that the Japanese saw suicide as the only honorable response to being captured, and those who did not respond in this way as without honor and therefore sub-human, mitigate their crimes at all? Major Nakamura gives this perspective with disconcerting frankness: \"What was a prisoner of war anyway? Less than a man, just material to be used to make the railways, like the teak sleepers and steel rails and dog spikes. If he, a Japanese officer, allowed himself to be captured, he would be executed on his ultimate return to the home islands anyway.\" Is it true that the greatest monsters, like Colonel Kota, were set free because they were Japanese nobility, while lowly Koreans and Formosans who served in the Japanese army were scapegoated? \"If they and all their actions were simply expressions of the Emperor's will, why then was the Emperor still free? Why did the Americans support the Emperor but hang them, who had only ever been the Emperor's tools?\" Flanagan worries at the truth of such questions with the same relentless tenacity he applies to every other aspect of this extraordinarily brave, bold book. It wasn't until I had almost finished reading THE NARROW ROAD TO THE DEEP NORTH that I was able to admit to myself that with a few notable exceptions, the parts of the story that had moved me most and would likely stay with me most clearly afterward were those told from the Japanese point of view. As an Australian myself, it was an intensely uncomfortable feeling to realize that the characters and stories I was most drawn to were Japanese. However, when I say that they moved me and drew me in, for the most part, I do not mean that they elicited positive feelings in me. Colonel Kota usually provoked intense hatred in me, as did \"the Goanna,\" and Tenji Nakamura usually left me profoundly uncomfortable and confused. Yet for my whole life, I've heard of the unspeakable atrocities perpetrated by the Japanese against the Australians on the Death Railway, and I have never been able to even begin to understand how the Japanese could justify their actions to themselves. This is the first story I have ever read that was able to begin to explain this to me, and that may be one of the most special things about this extraordinary book. Even though it makes me feel unclean to say so, in a small handful of places in this narrative, I felt the tiniest glimmer of pity for the Japanese characters as victims of an insane culture of hero worship and everyday brutality that very deliberately stifled such feelings as empathy and compassion, and molded men into monsters. \"Too much was made of killing, thought Nakamura. Maybe one should feel remorse, guilt, and at first in Manchukuo he had. But the dead soon ceased to be faces. He struggled to remember any of them. The dead are dead, he thought, and that's it.\" Choi Sang-min, whom the Australians called \"the Goanna,\" gives the perspective of a Korean forced into the lowly position of a guard in the POW camp: \"... when he was a guard, he lived like an animal, he behaved as an animal, he understood as an animal, he thought as an animal. And he understood that such an animal was the only human thing he had ever been allowed to be.\" Major Nakamura perfectly illustrates what the Japanese mindset was, a mindset so completely incomprehensible to Australians then or now: \"Nakamura had shed the blood of others and would willingly have shed his own. He told himself that, through his service of this cosmic goodness, he had discovered he was not one man but many, that he could do the most terrible things he might otherwise have thought were evil if he had not known that they were in the service of the ultimate goodness. For he loved poetry above all, and the Emperor was a poem of one word - perhaps, he thought, the greatest poem - a poem that encompassed the universe and transcended all morality and all suffering. And like all great art, it was beyond good and evil.\" The ending of the book is as perfectly real as everything that comes before it. It is as multi-layered as life, and I am grateful to have found a book and an author that understand such authenticity, especially at the end, where we find that: \"People kept on longing for meaning and hope, but the annals of the past are a muddy story of chaos only.\" A few of the layers are happy or at least peaceful; many are quietly tragic; some are unresolved; many are full of regret. Because life is like that. And so is death.

Flanagan\u2019s challenge here is to give literary form to the horrors of war, without resorting to despair or simple us-versus-them dichotomies. He maintains a careful balance of sympathy by shifting between the perspectives of the POWs and their Japanese captors, and by setting up a tripartite structure: a before, during and after that shows how war affects the whole of life. An absence of speech marks can at times foster detachment from the characters, but the writing is unfailingly beautiful. Japanese death poems and Tennyson\u2019s \u201cUlysses\u201d weave through as refrains, and the language is lyrical even when describing atrocities: corpses are \u201cdrying dark-red meat and fly-blown viscera.\u201d As the poem by Issa used as an epigraph reads, \u201cIn this world / we walk on the roof of hell / gazing at flowers\u201d \u2013 finding whatever shards of beauty and love we can, even in nightmarish circumstances.

It struck me most, telling me a truth that truth cannot tell, in one extended scene that shook me to the core. For those who haven't read this book, I will not spoil it with specifics. Imagine tomorrow, as you run into the market to buy a few things on your way home from work. You notice, 30 meters or yards in the distance, a former lover from 20 years ago, alone with a child. This is the one with whom you shared dreams of growing old together, your most intimate thoughts and your body. This flame, now a distant ember, long ago lit you ablaze with insatiable desire and passion. What would you do, think? Would you walk past, looking into your wallet/purse to avoid speaking? Would you stop and chat? If you stop, what would you say, what would there be to say, would it lead to an awkwardness you could never have foreseen all those years ago? What does your reaction say about you and about your life now and where it's gone since then? Would you view this moment and/or your reaction as a sadness, a reminder of how you were blessed to escape the relationship, a hint of despair and regret for what might have been, a spark for changes to the way things are now? You aren't the same person you were then, instead you're now a composite of many selves. That is to say, while your fundamental nature is the same, you've passed through other love(s), births, deaths, happiness, sadness, good health and bad and you've gained wisdom over time. \"In trying to escape the fatality of memory, he discovered with an immense sadness that pursuing the past inevitably only leads to greater loss.\" To me, these questions and thoughts are excellent illustrations of why no form of art is better able to touch us than fiction: provoking contemplation and memories, and reviving the feelings and the sensations from one's past. Without reading fiction, we may never be called on to face certain parts of our past and to focus on the mistakes we made, the feelings we had, the true intrinsic value of our personal histories. It seems to me this type of focus helps us to better love, to become better lovers, to take a chance at a moment to grasp love that will the next have forever slipped away, to appreciate the now, the kiss, the touch, the gaze, the knowing smile, the instruments we use to express our love. In these few pages of a novel set at a time and place totally foreign to me, I see what good novelists understand, what all artists see, what brilliant readers behold: \u201cThat's what fiction is for. It's for getting at the truth when the truth isn't sufficient for the truth .\" Tim O'Brien ...more \"A good book, he had concluded, leaves you wanting to reread the book.

He happily slept without women. He never slept without a book .\" Interspersed throughout the book there are Japanese haiku poems and references to Dorrigo's favorite poem \"Ulysses\" by Tennyson . These were beautiful additions and a much needed respite from the overwhelming gruesomeness of war that is portrayed here . The power of this story for me rests in Flanagan's clear and perfect writing both in the explicit details of the horrors of a WWII prison camp and the just beautiful language telling us of Dorrigo's passionate love affair with his uncle's wife . The brutal and oppressive conditions of hunger , malnutrition, disease , beatings and beheadings that these men endured as POWs working as slave laborers on the Thai-Burma Railway make this a difficult read . There is a blending of past and present rather than a chronological unfolding of events even though most of the book is focused on the war and his time at the Japanese prison camp . It's interesting that it isn't just focused on the prisoners but we see the point of view of the enemy officers who are in charge as well . The love story - well what can I say about it ? I felt consumed by it as Dorrigo and Amy were. There was passion and the feeling that it was so right that he and Amy belonged together even though she was married . \"How to name this ache he felt in his stomach for her , this tightness in his chest, this overwhelming vertigo? And how to say -in any words other than the obvious- that he now was possessed of only one thought which felt more an instinct : that he had to be near her , with her and only her . Dorrigo is flawed and one can hardly like him at times , but yet there are times when he truly is heroic and a good man. This is an enormously important book shedding light on horrific real events but it is also a story about love , about a man's mistakes , about the just so right things that he does - a book about what it means to be human . ...more I was writing a comment that I realized would probably end up being long enough to qualify as at least a half-assed review-like sumthin-r-nuther, so why not slap those words up here instead of down there?

Do you care? Probably not, but I don't intend to edit this, so here we are, twirling our thumbs at the tail-end of my useless introductory paragraph. Hi. This is one of those titles that almost certainly wouldn't have flown under my radar if my radar and I were left to our own devices. Like radars. Radars that don't pick up this book. It was the month of March's book club title, and I was feeling a little unsure about it at first, daunted by the length (I thought it was over 600 pages, long story) and all the roooooomance promised in the description. So, yeah, this has romance for about a third of it, but mostly it's a horrifyingly detailed depiction of life mostly among the Australian POW's working on the Burma Death Railway. Working? No, sorry, literally slaving the days away while shitting all over themselves from dysentery and cholera, covered in sores and nectrotic limb-stubs and pests, all while being starved so badly that even the biggest, baddy-assest bushmen more resembled praying mantises than human beings. And then they made them work nights, too. So yeah, though there is definitely a sizable romantic element anchored to the front of the book, it is mostly about the horrors of war, the triumphs and failings of the human spirit, and how gross, gross, GROSS bodies are. If this were the sum of it, you could probably pass the novel off as War porn or Allied Forces Porn or Macho Man Porn or whatever. Fortunately, in the increasingly common fashion of shifting narrative perspective, we are given not just a third person omniscient perspective of the POW's, but also those of the Japanese officers in Holy Charge of seeing the railroad's construction to its completion for the Emperor, and of the lower ranks of the Korean guards made to watch over (and often brutalize) the prisoners. (Oh, and the love object's perspective, which, meh.) The characters are consistently nuanced and even sympathetic, because shit's just not real simple, now is it? Impressively even-handed. I will say a couple more things: 1) It's overwritten in parts, namely the romance parts. I mean, her body was an unmemorizable poem? Well, then her body had better be the complete works of Nora Roberts, or you're just being lazy. (Not to say that's poetry, I'm just talking overall word-count here). The lame-o fluffy and often nonsensical love stuff aside, the writing worked for me in all the other scenes, because 10-dollar words and historical events where tens of thousands of people died for a dumb cause just kinda go together. But still, you've been warned. 2) There are two things at the end that should've been edited out. Those who have read it know what I mean when I say a) the fire and b) the coincidence. The a) part made me feel like I was suddenly and unwillingly watching Die Hard, and the b) thing was just sloppy and unnecessary. Why, coincidence, why? Is Tasmania really the size of a shopping mall? Poor choice. I promise it's good, or even great. It has been my favorite book club selection so far. Hopefully, though, I'll like the book better this month because it's being culled from my selections.

What is provocative is that the eponymous title is taken from the enduring 17th century Japanese poet, Bash\u014d; the title is a haibun (combining haiku and prose), which commemorates the Japanese spirit. The Australian POWs were forced into slave labor to build the Burma Railway Line, or the \"Death Railway.\" In other words, the Japanese \"spirit\" here was to crown the Emperor with this rail line, no matter if they had to beat, starve, and impose the most horrifying living conditions on the POWs. However, Flanagan nuanced his historical novel, a true masterpiece, with a number of contradictions within the book, often philosophical contradictions, and the title seems to be in the timbre of Flanagan's purposeful incongruities. The sum of its parts equal an astonishing, extraordinary whole. \"...all life is only allegory and the real story is not here...it was like the long autumn of a dying world.\" And: \"...all his life had been a journeying to this point when he had for a moment flown into the sun and would now be journeying away from it forever after. Nothing would ever be as real to him. Life never had such meaning again.\" These quotes come in the first few pages, when the protagonist, Dorrigo Evans, is an old man (the first quote) and a young lad. The first lines of the book harken to the bible--\"Why at the beginnings of things is there always light?\" and Dorrigo cradling a football in the light of the sun, which, several times throughout the novel is referred to as a moment that he had when he stole from the sun. A bulk of the novel takes place in the POW camp, where Dorrigo is a surgeon working in an operating theatre with very few tools, and coarse, crude instruments made of kitchen ware or things found in scraps or nature. Dorrigo and the soldiers he was traveled seven miles/day under the most profound physical atrocities in order to build this railway line. The men had names like Rabbit Hendricks, Chum Fahey, Tiny Middleton, Darky Gardiner--Pynchonian names that stuck with me as I read. The novel itself begins in an almost disjointed manner, more so for me because I was unfamiliar with this Australian history. I paused a few times in the first 50 or so pages to bone up on Wikipedia and other sources. But, by page 60, it began to collate. Time moves in a surreal fashion, back and forth but yet seamlessly, as if the different times didn't really matter, because it moved in the realm of a philosophy of life, part existential, part mystical, an intersection or a paradox of nihilism and open-hearted beauty. The life led by Dorrigo and his mates was very physical, graphic and harrowing. And it was juxtaposed beautifully with a love affair that Dorrigo had with a woman named Amy Mulvaney, who was married to his uncle. Dorrigo himself had a wife, Ella, but his thoughts always turned to Amy. \"His army life...When he looked at patients they were just windows through which he saw her and only her.\" And Amy: \"...love was the universe touching, exploding within one human being, and that person exploding into the universe. It was annihilation, the exploder of worlds.\" In the camp, the narrative refers to the Line as more than a railroad. Not just the horrifying conditions, but the fact that men walked in columns, a linear line, so to speak. Yet, the novel itself pays tribute to Japanese poetry, such as Shisui's death poem, a circle, something eternal. On his death bed, the 18th century haiku poet painted a circle (the drawing reproduced in the novel). \"Shisui's poem rolled through Dorrigo Evans' subconscious, a contained void, an endless mystery, lengthless breadth, the great wheel, eternal return: the circle--antithesis of the line.\" And that is what underscored everything for me as I read this novel. The forward progression under duress, with death as the finite point, and the philosophizing of the circular, endless, eternal. Dorrigo, his mates, his women--all searching for meaning, and often arriving at contradictions, narrated with astounding prose by Flanagan. It's the search for the meaning of existence, and periodically the rejection of it. Woven in the story are sections wherein the Japanese officers and guards are focused on, both during the war and afterwards. One of the cameo characters, a Japanese doctor named Sato, who did vicious acts during the war, says to a former Japanese Colonel, who is listed as a war criminal, \"There is a pattern and structure to all things. Only we can't see it. Our job is to discover that pattern and structure and work within it, as part of it.\" I see that as an underlying theme, an aspect of man's search for meaning. There's the beautiful, elegant, mystical essence, a feeling that beauty is within and without. On the other hand, a starving, broken and hollowed out POW will see things from a different vantage point: \"...Australia meant little against lice and hunger and beri-beri, against thieving and beatings and yet ever more slave labour. Australia was shrinking and shriveling, a grain of rice was so much bigger now than a continent.\" The essence of one's outlook can be fluid and optimistic, but when one's eyes are empty, or dead, they are just \"black-shadowed sockets waiting for worms.\" I have so many yellow stickies in this book--passages that touched my core emotions. If you are a literature lover, like Dorrigo Evans is, this book will unnerve you, amaze you. It all may boil down to a line that is a running motif in Flanagan's story, \"The world is. It just is.\" Is it? What is? There is so much to ponder here, from knowing that the world will continue on and on and on, even after we are dead; to profound solitude when we are alive; to memory, dreams, reality, existence, war, love, betrayal, poetry, godlessness, freedom, and the perceptions through this kaleidoscope of a novel. As Dorrigo, after the war, becomes a venerated surgeon, a war hero, he takes the world less seriously, as if this were all comic and contemptible. \"There was a growing industry of memory all around him, yet he recalled less and less.\" Dorrigo had stolen light from the sun and fallen to earth. For the few days it took me to read Flanagan's novel, I felt that. I was captivated in that experience in this monumental, stupendous novel of what it is to be human. ...more I struggled with this one.

Flanagan presents an unforgettable portrait of life in one of the infamous Japanese prison camps in Thailand tasked with the impossible job of creating railway lines through jungles and mountains. We read of a particular group of Australian soldier POWs led by Dorrigo Evans, a doctor and surgeon. And we read of some of the captors who consider these prisoners as failures who are worthless in allowing themselves to be captured alive. Their fates, therefore, belong to the emperor and are of no account. The framing story, moving back and forth in time in the twentieth century, shows some of Tasmanian history and, more specifically the early and later life of Evans: his impoverished childhood, his searching for love, eventual marriage, wandering eye and lack of focus in life. Elements of the love story were the part I had the most difficulty with, but not enough to subtract from my overall admiration for this work. The aspect of the framing story that I found stronger relates to those who actually returned from the camp, both Australian and Japanese: how they tried to live with their experiences and memories, their families, their futures. Flanagan's father did, in fact serve in WWII and was a prisoner in a railway camp. I imagine this book may be both a tribute to him and the many others involved while also being a strong testimony to the horrors of war, the weakness as well as strength of heroes, the need to understand our enemies, the overall complexity of human beings. This is a difficult book but it is also an important book, I believe, for these reasons.

Or myth to put it more politely. This book troubles the still surface of an Australian WWII hero's memory, reputation, and attitude toward his own status. I am relieved to love it. Mostly. I say relieved because it can be a kind of curse to have the author of one of your fave books ever inconveniently still alive, working and available to disappoint. It should be unsurprising that a grand achievement such as Gould's Book of Fish: A Novel in Twelve Fish might be hard to live up to with the one, two, now three books since, but it is also unsurprising that such an expectation is not quelled easily. Flanagan's first book The Sound of One Hand Clapping is a bleak and severe drama about a ruined daughter/father relationship made miniscule in the shadow of a giant hydroelectric dam in Tasmania that the hard-drinking father had worked on, living in the work-camp through his daughter's childhood. His second, Death of a River Guide is a lushly sensuous nature-drenched portrait of a life lived close to a land more and more changed by men, remembered by one man as he drowns. Gould's is a PoMo picaresque masterpiece. The Unknown Terrorist is an ironic noir veneer barely disguising a furious rant about terror hysteria. Wanting is a curiously hard-to-label subtle braid of tales involving imperialism and Dickens. This book returns to the grim terrain of The Sound of One Hand Clapping , both in its concrete portrait of brutal realities, as well as the primary place of a Grand Project that grinds mere humans to sludge in the course of its completion. This time the Grand Project is not a hydroelectric dam but a Japanese railway built by the slave labor of WWII prisoners of war (one of whom was the author's father who survived while 12,000 others did not). The novel slides back and forth through three main slots of time: Tennyson fan Dorrigo Evans' old age, from where he considers his past and the mythology of his own life; his time as an Australian Army surgeon, reluctantly hoisted to leader of a thousand of the men slaving to connect Thailand to Burma by rail; and his pre-capture life, including his deployment in the war during an obscure series of battles in the Middle East (who knew that the Aussies fought the Vichy French in Syria?). Also preceding his capture is a phase which cuts him more deeply than his horrific wartime experience: a brief affair he carried on with his uncle's wife Amy. Many chapters from this period are from Amy's point of view as the two take turns torturing themselves with guilt, lust, memory, and aching imaginings about what might have been . Some readers may find these tender and highly interior passages a welcome relief from the grisly reality of the war chapters, while others may find them a bit much and wonder when we'll get back to the violence ( \"He felt he might fly apart into a million fragments were it not for her arms and body holding him\" . etc.). Born, raised, and residing in out-of-the-way Tasmania, Flanagan has a nose for the obscure and much of his work gives color, shape, and most importantly light to overlooked subjects, events, and people. That is as good a reason as any to read him, but for me it's the luscious charge of his language: \"Rabbit Hendricks--a compact man with an ill-fitting set of dentures--was finishing a sketch on the back of a postcard of Damascus that was to serve as a replacement for a disintegrating photograph of Lizard Brancussi's wife, Maisie. A spiderweb of fine cracks had spread across her face, and what was left of the emulsion had curled into so many tiny autumnal leaves that she was now a woman to be guessed at.\" What I liked most about that passage was that it reminded me of something I might have forgotten forever: the strange way old-fashioned photographs decay, heightening their effect of presenting to us images of things lost to the past. The past is important to this book, but its import is ambiguous: it doesn't sound a clear message or meaning to the future, nor does it stamp characters with any tics, tendencies, or traits. It is just the past. Because of documentaries, articles, and books, everyone in the Australia of this novel knows of Dorrigo Evans' past. He is a man stumped by the fact his face is planted on memorial coins and postage stamps, pressing his name, his image, his place in society to a personal past and a sense of self, but those things somehow refuse to adhere. He is as averse to the heroic version as he is to the humility such an aversion presumes. Heroic and humble share that curious property of resisting self-application. \"The Narrow Road to the Deep North\" is a 1694 Samurai travel diary-poem by Matsuo Munefusa. It first comes up in a discussion between the labor-camp's leader Major Nakamura and his visiting supervisor Captain Kota as they discuss the subtle beauty of Japanese poetry: Even in Kyoto When I hear the cuckoo I long for Kyoto This is not a moment demonstrating art's power to lift the spirit even in the bleakest circumstance, nor is it about the mysterious property of fine poetry that tames a savage breast, or any such humane magic. This discussion immediately follows Colonel Kota's disquisition on the proper way to behead a man with a sword. He's proud of his own experience with that craft--executed under orders as well as just for practice using handy prisoners--and how it has changed him such that the first thing he notices about people are their necks. There is a quick hint of some latent homo impulses in this monster too, as Flanagan skirts dangerously close to that old trope of the gay super-evil effete villain who sees himself above all morals and whose wickedness is married to some perverse aesthetic. Fortunately Colonel Kota was not petting a cat while describing how evil indeed he can be. He is really into himself, so does not notice that there is something wrong with Major Nakamura: he's a tweaker. It's stating the obvious that being a slave laborer in a POW camp working on a jungle railroad would not be a lot of fun, even if your slave-driver is a meth-addicted maniac tormented by a bad case of speed bugs. Ok, especially if . [Note: \"speed bugs\" are the tactile hallucinations caused by stimulants, in which the addicts imagine that insects are digging around under the skin. Telling them No, I don't see anything on your skin may cause irritation.] Flanagan himself seems to occasionally get the speed bugs as he keeps his chapters clipped, flashes of moments separated by minutes or decades, which gives the whole book a fidgety feel. This is exacerbated by the chapters' high-contrast contents when we go from Big Experience vignettes during wartime, to warm-glow slow-mo romantic interludes that could snuggle in quite cozily between acts two and three of a Merchant Ivory film. It also moves from brutally action-packed to hazily contemplative in a blink. He is much better at action and the sensual aspects of setting than the contemplation which usually either dead-ends or stops at a fork in the road and chooses both: love and hate, truth and illusion, heroism and humility. It is hard to say whether this is ambition or indecision. I'll just say it's both, like he does. This book is full of assertions wed to their negations: knowing and unknowing, seeing and unseeing. This novel is not for the squeamish. Those readers who prefer an oblique impressionistic rendering of men at their worst would do well to skip the chapters where Dorrigo struggles mightily and bloodily with an ad-hoc prison work-camp amputation of a withered soldier's stinking gangrenous leg, only to be interrupted so he can attempt to halt the general meeting where all the prisoners are gathered to watch a kind man, one of their own, dragged from the infirmary and beaten to blue muddy meat for something he didn't do. The gross details are stark and legion, surely breaking some kind of record in the number of ways one may describe shit, filth, rot, and the many unseemly features of ruined bodies lingering at death's doorway, shredded and shriveled by starvation, fatigue, disease, and of course regular beatings. I wouldn't say the book wallows in this matter, but others might. Even if put off by this, one has to admire the way Flanagan manages to telescope so smoothly from the broad circumstance of war trapping captor and captive alike, down to details as intimate as one man's mouth, which is \"...a mess, the palate having shed its skin in rags\" as the bugler Jimmy Bigelow prepares to play \"Last Post\" over the funeral pyre of yet another gang of comrades: \"As with everything else in that dark, dreary jungle world, Jimmy Bigelow had to improvise, tricking his tongue by sliding breaths around its whale-like form, deceiving his screaming nerve ends by concentrating on just hitting those notes, holding it together one more time for all of them who would stay in that jungle and never find their way back home. And at the end, embarrassed by tears that came not from any emotion--for he felt no more at that moment than at the five funerals he had played at yesterday or the day before that--but from the physical pain of playing, he quickly turned away, so that no one would know what an ordeal playing a simple tune had become or think he had grown oddly soft.\" Just about anything written about soldiers deals with the strange irreconcilable difference between life during wartime and \"ordinary\" civilian life. This experiential chasm is often glossed over with terms like \"readjustment\" or a dialog-stopping assertion that those who have never been there can never know. Flanagan puts points on the details of the differences and, more than anyone I've read, movingly illuminates what such readjustment asks. \"To have been part of a Pharaonic slave system that had at its apex a divine sun king led him to understand unreality as the greatest force in life. And his life was now, he felt, one monumental unreality, in which everything that did not matter--professional ambitions, the private pursuit of status, the colour of wallpaper, the size of an office or the matter of a dedicated car parking space--was vested with the greatest significance, and everything that did matter--pleasure, joy, friendship, love--was deemed somehow peripheral. It made for dullness mostly and weirdness generally.\" In this book it is dullness rarely and weirdness generally and specifically as we see what post-war life offers not only Dorrigo but many of his mates and a few of his captors, the only guiding rule seeming to be a lack of justice as those with the most responsibility for the horror face the most minor consequences and those hurt the deepest still ache on in new and less obvious (and forgivable) ways, which notions of heroism or humility do little to explain. ...more This novel has as its heart and soul a male character called Dorrigo Evans who becomes the surgeon and commanding officer at a Japanese POW camp of Australian soldiers. Dorrigo is not a particularly likeable chap. He reminded me of the protagonist of Salter\u2019s All That Is.

Dorrigo is not a particularly likeable chap. He reminded me of the protagonist of Salter\u2019s All That Is. A male from the old school, egotistically incapable of love who self-servingly dramatises feeling rather than succumbs to it. Feeling for him is a kind of armour he employs to protect himself from his burrowed sense of his own shortcomings \u2013 most notably his inability to love his wife and children. He is haunted (though not sustained) by his love for his uncle\u2019s young wife, Amy. To my mind the relentlessly overwritten character of Dorrigo was what let this novel down. Apparently this was Flanagan telling his own father\u2019s story so maybe put all the overwriting down to the admirable attempt of a son to do his father justice \u2013 though, ironically, for me it had the opposite effect. Okay. It started off really well and I was sure I was going to love this novel until Flanagan started writing about sexual passion. All of a sudden, he began to read like a frustrated older man working up into a firework frenzy the lost passions of his youth - his rather self-consciously epic tone suddenly striking a galore of false notes. And from then on I was continually tripped by the constant wheezing and straining for high epic grandeur which repeatedly threw Flanagan\u2019s voice out of tune. The Narrow Road does not have the effortless control of say previous Booker winner Hilary Mantel\u2019s two Cromwell novels. He\u2019s trying way too hard to write an epic (the awful film Australia sprang to mind for which Flanagan wrote the script). But I think this also comes down to Flanagan\u2019s shortcomings as a dramatist. More often than not highly charged language replaces characterisation and as a result empathy with characters is surrendered. Take this for example - \u201cTo hold a gesture, a smell, a smile was to cast it as one fixed thing, a plaster death mask, which as soon as it was touched crumbled in his fingers back into dust.\u201d What the hell does that mean? Flanagan won the worst sex award; I\u2019d nominate him here for the most overblown and absurd account of the act of memory. His insistence on the epic sweep of his novel is also evident in the relentless cataloguing of horrors. The problem is the horrors take precedence over the individuals they\u2019re happening to. The beating of one man, already on his last legs, lasts four pages and becomes boring before it becomes preposterous. Later we\u2019re told how Japanese surgeons performed autopsies on living American prisoners though this is an historical detail that feels shovelled gratuitously into the narrative for more shock horror. Just as he strains in his love scenes so too does Flanagan strain when trying to evoke the horror. As I said, Flanagan isn\u2019t a great dramatist. He\u2019s much better at analysis. The author\u2019s dispassionate insights are often the most memorable passages of the book, the philosophical insights of preceding drama. Like this - \u201cHe grasped the truth of a terrifying world in which one could not escape horror\u2026 the world did not change, this violence had always existed and would never be eradicated, men would die under the boot and fists and horror of other men until the end of time, and all human history was a history of violence. Violence was eternal, the great and only verity, greater than the civilisations it created.\" And the best characters, oddly, were the Japanese officers and guards. Flanagan shows us how the \u201cJapanese spirit\u201d, the Emperor\u2019s will takes hold of the psyche of these men and replaces the circuitry of personal morality. A brilliant scene is when Colonel Koto learns how to cut off heads with his sword. The alienation from his humanity brilliantly evoked. Another memorable passage is the last night of the Korean guard before his execution for class B war crimes when he does a brilliant job of taking us inside the heart and soul of a condemned simple man who was doing nothing but obeying orders. This is a novel about ordinary men given experience they have no way of understanding or coming to terms with. Flanagan is cleverer at showing the gifts to be had from war than the horror. Captures brilliantly the sense that the war experience remains pivotal to the life of these men and in many ways the most redeeming feature of their lives. The horror of war has been done many times; the redemptive humanising gifts of war less so and this, for me, is where Flanagan excels. The women in this novel are insipid. Outside of the war, the novel\u2019s most important character is Amy. \u201cAs a meteorite strike long ago explains the large lake now, so Amy\u2019s absence shaped everything, even when \u2013 and sometimes most particularly when \u2013 he wasn\u2019t thinking of her.\u201d But here we have another problem. This isn\u2019t about Amy; it\u2019s a man seeking to convince himself his feeling is grandiose. Amy is unbelievable as a living breathing woman. She\u2019s a man\u2019s wet dream, even \u2013 especially - when Flanagan takes us inside her feeling. Flanagan even replicates some of Dorrigo\u2019s feelings in her. So when Dorrigo can\u2019t stand the physical proximity of Amy, Amy later can\u2019t stand the physical proximity of Dorrigo. Amy is male wish fulfilment. Made clear when we later find out she has supposedly spent her life pining away for Dorrigo \u2013 a stance completely at odds with her pragmatic character (initially she married a much older man she didn\u2019t love for the physical comforts he could provide so how idealistic is Amy really?). I never believed in Amy as anything but a male projection. This isn\u2019t by any means a bad novel but I find it hard to believe there weren\u2019t half a dozen more deserving novels for the Booker prize. I\u2019m soon to read The Bone Clocks, All the Light We Cannot See and Zone of Interest and I\u2019ll be amazed if all three aren\u2019t more worthy winners. ...more Why do readers like this book?

Based on the 8% I read, Flanagan has inherited all of McCarthy's bad qualities, and none of his good ones. The tone went beyond precious and self-important into the realm of self-parody. I could picture Flanagan writing some of the corkers in this book while leaning back in his bare pine chair, smiling grimly, and then throwing back a shot of scotch. The tone ruined the characters for me. Despite Flanagan's best efforts, Dorrigo comes across as a guy who claims to feel unworthy but in fact thinks he is worth far more than anyone else around him. Let me cull a few samples from this book, almost at random. If you think these passages exemplify good writing, then you will probably love this book. However, if you find yourself chortling, then I wouldn't be shocked if you abandoned this book like I did, or wish bitterly that you had. \"Shisui's poem rolled through Dorrigo Evans' subconscious, a contained void, an endless mystery, lengthless breadth, the great wheel, eternal return: the circle--anithesis of the line.\" [I've practiced Buddhism for 25 years now, and I don't find this sentence profound, just pretentious.] \"He happily slept without women. He never slept without a book.\" [Gag.] \"He feared that only in them was the terrible perfection of suffering and knowledge that made one fully human.\" [Yes, I can imagine him walking to Starbuck's, shaking with fear about the terrible perfection of suffering. Paging Mr. McCarthy.] \"I shall be a carrion monster, he whispered into the coral shell of her ear, an organ of women he found unspeakably moving in its soft, whorling vortex, and which always seemed to him to be an invitation to adventure.\" [O ye, carrion monster, thou doth enter into the ear of Woman!] \"He found her nipples wondrous.\" [O wondrous nipple, how circular thy form! How vast thy mystery!] \"I wrote. Something. Yes. And you were truthful. No. You weren't truthful? I was accurate.\" [I. Wanted. To. Yes. Reach for. Some ... thing. True? Yes. No. May I use your bathroom?] \"He was looking past Amy's naked body, over the crescent line between her chest and hip, haloed with tiny hairs, to where, beyond the weather French doors with their flaking white paint, the moonlight formed a narrow road on the sea that ran away from his gaze INTO SPREADEAGLED CLOUDS.\" [Emphasis mine.] I just couldn't take it. There are lines like this on every page. I'm disappointed because I love WW2 novels, and Flanagan is telling a fascinating story that I very much want to hear. I know it's a Very Important Book. But frankly, and I realize 95% of readers will disagree with me, the writing is just plain bad. ...more This book had a soul-searing affect on me.

The events and emotions in Narrow Road delve deeper, into what it all means, and why, and how, and what if. Real life that doesn't make much sense, and none at all during war, especially in a Japanese POW camp. Richard Flanagan not only made me feel the suffering and the humanity of the Australian men laboring as slaves to build an impossible railway line in the middle of the jungle, while starving, diseased, beaten, tortured, and dying in great numbers; he went so far as to try to explain the beliefs of the Japanese officers who condoned the treatment for the glory of the Emperor. Two quotes from the book, out of many that I highlighted: \"Life wasn't about ideas. Life was a bit about luck. Mostly though, it was a stacked deck. Life was only about getting the next footstep right.\" \"In this world we walk on the roof of hell gazing at flowers.\" I read this book as a download on my Kindle, but I'm going to buy a copy to put on my shelf.

Military surgeon Dorrigo Evans is our Virgil, leading us through the underworld of cruelty along that The Narrow Road to the Deep North . This novel was recently awarded the Man Booker Prize, and once again, I am whole in with the award. Like the two previous winners ( The Luminaries , by Eleanor Catton; Bring Up the Bodies , by Hilary Mantel), the committee favored a work of historical fiction with a complicated structure (though nothing can compare to the kaleidoscopic corkscrews of The Luminaries ) and a strong narrative voice, or in the case of The Narrow Road to the Deep North and The Luminaries , a multiplicity of voices. The framework of this novel is built around Dorrigo Evans, whom we meet as a child in Tasmania. His intellect lifts him from the wild and desolate island into university and an officer\u2019s station during the war, but no privilege can spare Dorrigo the depravations of the Japanese army. The narrative moves nimbly between past and present. Dorrigo Evans looks back on his life from the perch of old age, reflecting, \u201cA happy man has no past, while an unhappy man has nothing else.\u201d And it cannot be said that Dorrigo is a happy man. Ironically, he is a legend, a national hero, for having survived the forced labor camps in the Thai-Burma jungle that killed over 90,000 Asian civilian laborers and 13,000 Allied POWs (I have read so many conflicting figures that I hesitate to assign real numbers to the casualties, but these are the most consistent. The scale of horror exceeds the imagination). But even before his military service, Dorrigo holds the world arm\u2019s length. He exudes a cynic\u2019s distrust and reserve. Perhaps it is this essence of distance that allows him to survive the labor camps with his mind intact, but he returns to the world with an almost sociopathic regard for personal relationships. He is a serial philanderer, cheating even on his mistresses. And there is shadowy mention of questionable medical ethics. Flanagan does this amazing thing of taking a cipher and baring his soul, to show us that our heroes are deeply flawed human beings, potentially ruined by the very events that made us venerate them. Through the decades following the war he felt his spirit sleeping, and though he tried hard to rouse it with the shocks and dangers of consecutive and sometimes concurrent adulteries, outbursts, and acts of pointless compassion and reckless surgery, it did no good. As the novel enters the war and thrusts us into that fetid jungle, we enter the lives of many in Evans\u2019 troop, these \u201ccobbers\u201d who cling to one another for survival. Rooster MacNeice, Darky Gardiner, Sheephead Morton, Bonox Baker\u2014names and identities so quintessentially Aussie\u2014laconic but good-natured men accustomed to hard labor and few luxuries. What awaits them, and the reader, in the Japanese POW camps is beyond all comprehension. But we do try to comprehend, don\u2019t we? That is why we read\u2014to understand what it is we cannot imagine on our own. As I read the unspeakable, my inner voice cried, Why? How? How can any man do to another what these Japanese soldiers did to the railway laborers? Dorrigo Evans seeks to understand, too. At that moment he admired the terrible will of Nakamura\u2014admired it more even than he despaired of the beating of Darky Gardiner\u2014the grim strength, the righteous obedience to codes of honour that allowed no doubt. But is this explanation enough? This sense of duty, a warrior\u2019s code of honor? There is no reason in war, as Flanagan shows us, there is only what is, and what must be endured. he grasped the truth of a terrifying world in which one could not escape horror\u2026 the world did not change, this violence had always existed and would never be eradicated, men would die under the boot and fists and horror of other men until the end of time, and all human history was a history of violence. In a twist of narrative I wasn\u2019t expecting and was reluctant to give myself over to, Flanagan takes us into the world of Major Nakamura, the camp commander who was responsible for so much of the torture inflicted upon Evans\u2019 men. We are led into the post-war Inferno of Tokyo after surrender, a city in ruins, where Nakamura is hunted as a war criminal. Rather than seeking to elicit sympathy for Nakamura, Flanagan shows what doing evil does to a human being born, as we all are, without a blemish. I\u2019m just not capable of presenting all the moral voyages a reader will experience along The Narrow Road to the Deep North or articulating the subtle power of this book\u2019s construction and its prose. These are beyond this lay reader's ability. I\u2019m also not capable of rereading the novel, though I wish I could, simply to learn from Richard Flanagan\u2019s incredible skill.
