About 100 pages in. Jack Reacher worked it out about 400 pages later. Turns out it wasn't such a Hard Way. The book's complete nonsense, and Reacher's laughable. But despite it all, he read it fast. And he can't say he'd refuse another Reacher book from the mother-in-law.

If you feel a certain affinity for the lone hero, a man of principle, of unwavering knowledge and assent as to his own actions, than Jack Reacher's your kinda guy. Lee Child has created an unforgettable and unique character in his creation of Jack Reacher. Jack seems to implicitly understand that he is a unique animal/human running around on this planet and that in spite of social conventions, cultural trappings, and whatever conventions and abstractions we allow into our mind in order to alleviate this core fact of our singularity (and aloneness)...the truth of it is not something Mr. Reacher denies. He embraces it. Understands his philosophy implicitly, revels in his physical being,his conventions and values. He defends those he loves, those he does allow into his world, with a loyalty bar none while never letting go of the notion that he is alone and being perfectly comfortable with that.

This gripping novel captures your attention immediately with a well paced and easy plot; containing a fair share of suspense, action, surprises and romance. The prose is clear and concise all through, no place for ambiguity. The leading character is well drawn; Jack Reacher is a maverick, kind of 21st century cowboy, good hearted globe trotter having another absorbing adventure involving many equally interesting secondary characters. I started at this point in the series and I feel the story stood on its own and not based on any previous characters and episodes as in some other series. This thriller gives you a definite adrenaline rush, captivating till the end. ...more The hard way (Jack Reacher #10), Lee Child \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0631\u0627\u0647 \u0633\u062e\u062a - \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 10 - \u0627\u0632 \u0633\u0631\u06cc \u062c\u06a9 \u0631\u06cc\u0686\u0631\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u0644\u06cc \u0686\u0627\u06cc\u0644\u062f\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0622\u0628\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u062a\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u0633\u060c 1395\u061b \u062f\u0631 539 \u0635\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9786001821974\u061b Weak 3 stars.

Lane runs a group of military mercenaries for hire. REVIEWER\u2019S OPINION: It\u2019s mostly police style investigating. Not enough smart things were being done, either by the bad guys or the good guys. The husband was wealthy and could have put tracking devices on the car, or had video/pictures taken near the car. There is almost no action until the end of the book. The best Reacher stories have been thrillers, with a bad guy plotting and trying to harm Reacher. This is not a thriller. It\u2019s mostly just solving the mystery with some action at the end. But because I like the character Reacher so much, I was ok with this. I didn\u2019t feel a need for it to be over. I noticed some reviewers complain that the phrase \u201cReacher said nothing\u201d is overused in these books. I disagree. He\u2019s the \u201csilent type.\u201d Studies have shown that most women use twice as many (or more) words per day than most men. In that sense, it fits. Reacher is not as talkative as others. I was disappointed that the author did not show one scene. A female does something stupid which allows the bad guys to capture her and others. We don\u2019t see how it happened. It was told, not shown. In one scene the good guys are safe in their house. In the next scene they are tied up in another location and being hurt by the bad guys. I had one other problem. I almost wish I had not read the book because one back story was too horrible for me. Two soldiers were captured and kept in an African prison for five years, with body amputations and repulsive living conditions. I\u2019ve read a lot of fiction with bad guys doing horrible things, but other books did not bother me the way this did. I\u2019m not sure why, but it kept me awake at night. THE SERIES: This is book 10. I suggest reading the books in order, but not required. I gave 4 or more stars to all of the preceding books except four: Running Blind, Without Fail, The Enemy, and this one. Save these for last if you\u2019re NOT a die hard Reacher fan.

He already has a tendency to observe, calculate, and catalog and his years in the military police have provided him with a wealth of psychological field study of the worst of human nature. It's only sharpened his edge. Reacher is so incredibly observant---well, yeah, it helps that this is fiction and anyone can look brilliant when it merely takes a keystroke, let me enjoy my fantasies, will 'ya!? It always amazes me how the protagonist in a story can take a tiny bit of information and blow it up into an answer. Yeah, it takes time and a lotta effort. But s/he teases out that one little bit and keeps following the trail. Whoa, Reacher? Tense? Just reading the way Reacher thinks makes me consider how I observe life around me. Make me more aware of my surroundings. I'll never be a Reacher, but it does make life richer. Ooh, Reacher is wrong! Omigod. One for the record books. A lesson can be learned from how he reacts to it however. Instead of moaning and groaning and proffering up excuses, he ties a knot and moves on. Both Reacher and Kate want to use Lane's money to help the men and their families who were damaged or destroyed by Lane's actions, so, why did they leave the money behind?? What a bunch of scum...I love what Reacher does to the bad guys at the end. And he ain't alone in it. The Story Edward Lane's wife has been kidnapped. And he's in a panic. This has happened before. His first wife. Anne. He brought in the police. He paid the ransom. She was still murdered. He won't make that mistake again. Instead, he makes a worse one. He hires Reacher. He won't be needing that mirror on a stick... The Characters Jack Reacher is a drifter, a loner, and he likes it that way. Rarely staying in the same place two days in a row, he carries no luggage except a toothbrush in his shirt pocket. It's been seven years since he left the military. What he learned as an M.P. is still, however, with him. Edward Lane was a colonel in the army who retired under a cloud. He set himself up as the head of a band of mercenaries working under the radar for Uncle Sam. John Gregory is British, former SAS, and Lane's second-in-command. Carter Groom , Addison , Perez , Kowalski , and Burke are the rest of the A-team besides Graham Taylor , former SAS, who was her driver that day. They're sure he was murdered once they got the wife and kid off the streets. Knight and Clay Hobart are former A-team members. Until they got caught in a suspicious ambush in Africa. Dee Marie Graziano is Hobart's crusading, compassionate sister. Susan Jackson is Graham's sister. She's married to Tony and they have a daughter Melody ; they work an organic farm up near Norwich in England. Kate is Lane's second wife and she has an eight-year-old daughter, Jade . Patricia Joseph was Anne's sister. She doesn't buy Lane's story. Detective Brewer is with the NYPD and is the recipient of her information and concerns. He in turn, passes her info on to Lauren Pauling , the FBI special agent who was in charge of Anne's kidnapping. She's now a private investigator. The Cover The cover is awash in reds with a blast of yellow and green illuminating the tilted landscape. I want to say it's an alley, but what alley has an overhead roof of planks? The title tells it like it is. Reacher and his new best friends are going to have to take this guy down The Hard Way . ...more Lessons learned: kidnappings are never as simple as they appear.

A woman and her daughter have been kidnapped and Reacher is hired by the distraught husband to help bring them home at any cost. While working with his temporary employer, he soon learns of the man's sordid and criminal past, which may play a role in the larger kidnapping rationale. The further he digs, the less Reacher thinks this is a simple swap of money for live bodies, but perhaps a payback for horrible decisions made overseas. Working with an ex-FBI agent, Reacher discovers that nothing is as it seems and sometime love has caveats and limits. Child brings some of his personal knowledge to the pages of this novel, adding a new layer of excitement and intrigue. As interesting as Child can make these Reacher novels, I am always surprised to see what can be done to one up the series to that point. Child keeps Reacher as a 'nothing holds me down' type character, returning to cities he has already visited (perhaps one downside to the series), with adventures wherever he goes. However, each book is fresh and highly gripping with nuances yet to be revealed and new angles about Reacher's life yet to be highlighted. I have made sure many people know about this wonderful series and its central character, in hopes that it can be a wonderful addition to the beach reading list or travel pile. Kudos, Mr. Child for making me more and more curious with each new novel. ...more I quite enjoyed this one (again, the rating is for quality within the series rather than an absolute rating). You know what you're getting, though there was less of the violence this time, more police procedural in nature. However... The twists?

I've not really paid much attention to how infuriatingly smug Reacher can be at times either but it was in your face here. Want to know the technical definition of a Grange? Ask Reacher. I also found a lot to laugh at in Child's writing style. Sure it's not fine art but at times he's just too much. The repetition is tolerable but the dumbing down isn't. My favorite incredibly patronising moment was the following: \"two roads in, radial, like spokes in a wheel. One was north of northeast and the other was east of northeast. We called then the One O'clock Road and the Two O'clock Road. Like the face of a wristwatch? If twelve o'clock was due north, there were roads at the one o'clock position and the two o'clock position\". How many different ways do you have to say it? I found it patronising but it's even worse that it's being spoken by a special forces guy to Reacher and an ex-FBI agent. There were a few examples of similar nature but that was the one that stuck with me. Despite all the ridiculous elements (maybe because of them) I still enjoyed it and of course I'm going to work my way through the others. They're addictive and sometimes that's enough. ...more Do you remember the old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon-- Rocky would prepare to announce the next segment and Bullwinkle says \"Hey Rock, watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat.\" Rocky answers in disbelief, \"Again, that trick never works!\" As I started the next novel in my never-ending pursuit of completing this series of Reacher novels I had one of those moments where I wanted to say \"Again?

I didn't-- rather I plowed right threw this one and was pleased that there were enough of the Reacher Plot twists I've come to know and love. Reacher continues to be tough, smart, and relentless, etc. which is pretty good for a guy who is always in the wrong place at the wrong time.. (usually drinking coffee.. ) This time, Reacher gets involved in helping a wealthy man find his kidnapped wife. But is the guy a victim or a criminal mastermind or both? This is not the best of the Reacher novels.. but in my opinion, the Reacher novels are worth reading because of the mixture of mystery, plot twists, action, and Reacher's blend of justice. ...more At first it seems simple: Jack Reacher sees the pick-up of a kidnap ransom.

The Jack Reacher novels are a series but can be read out of order; the do stand alone. In the later books , Jack Reacher is becoming a bit more of an anti-hero. He is not a 'nice' guy--but if you needed help against the bad guys, he'd be the one you need. Recommended for fans of mysteries, action, suspense and thrillers.

I would not recommend this series for anyone under 18). ...more **3.5 stars** Not the best Reacher book ever but it had a happy ending (sort of...at least for the series standard) which I liked.

It\u2019s common knowledge that Reacher doesn\u2019t own a cell phone but I suspect he maintains a willful ignorance when it comes to developments in cell phone technology because, goddammit, the man needs a real challenge! For Reacher, perhaps finding a worthy opponent -- finding \u201cthe hard way\u201d -- is his most impossible mission. This is a firm recommendation. ...more This is an enjoyable, conventional thriller. The pacing is excellent, with surprisingly little filler for a 500-page novel (though he does have a fascination with describing rooms). The plot is a bit predictable, but watching the investigation unfold is a pleasure and makes the book hard to put down. The part I liked least is Reacher himself.

Anyway, this was my first Reacher and I'll probably pick up another one next time I'm in an airport or something. ...more If you've read one you've read em all but this one was a particular highlight for me. I shan't give spoilers but enjoyed the setting, the pace and the finale Poor Jack Reacher. The man can't even sit in a cafe in Manhattan and enjoy his favorite drink- coffee- without a nasty crime needing his skill to solve and risking his life falling into his lap. For those who don't know him, Jack was born in a military family, looks NOTHING like pretty boy Tom Cruise (think Mickey Rourke in \"The Wrestler\" for what Jack looks like), and his whole family is now dead. He spent 13 years as a military policeman and investigator and has now been seeing the one country Poor Jack Reacher. The man can't even sit in a cafe in Manhattan and enjoy his favorite drink- coffee- without a nasty crime needing his skill to solve and risking his life falling into his lap. For those who don't know him, Jack was born in a military family, looks NOTHING like pretty boy Tom Cruise (think Mickey Rourke in \"The Wrestler\" for what Jack looks like), and his whole family is now dead. He spent 13 years as a military policeman and investigator and has now been seeing the one country he never saw as a kid- his own USA. He carries nothing with him but a toothbrush, buys used clothes to wear a few days and throw away but keeps his teeth and body clean. He's quite the enigma but while he will kill a bad guy with no guilt, he has a heart for the downtrodden, kids, and women. So, here is java loving Jack making the mistake of returning to a cafe where he got good coffee the day before to have more. The night before he saw something rather odd- a mercedes parked illegally at a fire hydrant and a shifty man getting in it. Now another man shows up asking the waiter if anyone there had been there the night before and of course he points out our Jack. Jack soon finds himself at the exclusive Dakota building where John Lennon lived before he was murdered and obsessed with seeing John's widow Yoko. There is a safe with at least 30 million or so in cash in it and Lane, the owner of the apartment and the money, is an ex-military man who is now a for-hire mercenary with a whole pack of bad guys who left the American and British military under less than savory conditions. Lane's ex-model wife Kate has been kidnapped along with her little 8 year old girl Jade from a previous marriage and Taylor, the thug driving them to shop. Soon Lane offers Jack a cool million to find them. Oh and 5 years earlier, his first wife, ex-model Anne was kidnapped and killed the same way. There are many questions that come to Jack especially after he meets Anne's sister Patti Joseph who has been living across from the Dakota and spying on Lane and his men (making notes, taking photos) because she wants to prove that her sister was murdered by Lane for asking for a divorce and alimony, a NYPD cop who Patti feeds info to (a lonely guy who thinks she is sexy), the ex-FBI agent Lauren Pauling who the cop gives Patti's info to (she was the agent in charge of Anne's case and feels guilty she died), and one of the two men Lane left behind in Africa when on a mercenary jaunt. Hobarth lives with his sister and just got freed from Africa where they cut off a hand and foot each year for 4 years. Has Kate really been kidnapped or did she ask for a divorce and get murdered like Anne? Or did she run away? Was that body in the river Taylor or is he off somewhere? What about the other man- the one who killed Anne and was left in Africa along with Hobarth? Is he back alive for revenge? Of course Jack begins sleeping with Lauren. Lee Child has seen too many James Bond movies and he has Jack sleep with some woman in every book for no reason and with no idea of romance. Who are those heavily armed people on a farm outside of London? Read this and find out. As always, I enjoy the Reacher books. ...more If you were in a tight spot and you could call anyone in the world, living or dead, real or unreal, anyone at all to help you out, who would you call?

Well for starters, he\u2019s a six foot something ex-military policeman who knows his guns, ammo and the most effective places to punch people, AND quite attractive and incredibly buff, but mainly because he\u2019s a GODDAMN GENIUS. Sherlock Holmes has got nothing on Reacher\u2019s powers of deduction, let me tell you. Jack Reacher is the ultimate blend of brains and brawn. OK, I confess, I\u2019ve read all the Jack Reacher novels, and this is the latest. So I\u2019m a fan. Reacher left the army many years ago and kind of drifts around the US, solving all the problems which invariably and incredibly coincidentally drop in his lap. (He\u2019s not unlike Miss Marple in that way). Also, he sleeps with a different woman in every book \u2013 strange how women seem to find Reacher completely irresistible. Were these books written by a man? Let me check\u2026 In this adventure he becomes involved with a group of ex-US-military mercenaries \u2013 the wife of the boss mercenary has been kidnapped, and Reacher just happened to witness a critical piece of evidence in the whole deal. It was a bit slow to get going, but by golly pretty soon I was hooked. Every so often when reading one of Reacher\u2019s adventures it crosses my mind that this is all a bit far-fetched (the start of this novel, for example), but usually I\u2019m enjoying the book too much to care. Maybe don\u2019t read several in a row though; the plot devices and even Reacher's own infallible geniusness start to wear a bit thin. Also I had a moment of unease near the end of the book where Lee Child writes that \u201c\u2026the remorse gene was missing from his DNA. Entirely. It just wasn\u2019t there.\u201d Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I believe this may make Jack Reacher a registered and card-carrying sociopath \u2013 let\u2019s just be glad he\u2019s on our side. ...more *maybe slightly spoilers in reflection* Summary: Reacher finds himself in the middle of quite the kidnapping mystery.

Most people are just going to read the book, but for the few of us who love audiobook versions, be aware that there's a very long, very tedious, pretty much maddening section around disc 6 or 7 where Reacher and his female flavor of the book are interviewing a guy who's clearly had a few rough years. The performance is decent from an acting point of view, but the decision to include a heavy, ponderous speech flaw into an audiobook is downright baffling. It leaves you wondering what the heck the powers that be were thinking. Back to the story analysis ... My main problem with Running Blind (a.k.a. The Visitor) was that I didn't like any of the characters because they were all pretty much mean-spirited bullies, including Reacher. In The Hard Way, there are still bad guys and many people flawed enough to seem realistic, but at least Reacher's brand of vigilante justice actually seems like justice this go-round. The reader's perceptions are meant to flip several times in the book between who's good and who's evil. While the plot is way out there, the conclusion's satisfying. I give plot in most thrillers a pretty generous credibility excuse card. As with any book, there are some tedious sections and some over emphasis on making the title fit, but overall, I enjoyed this Reacher story much more than the others I've experienced of late. Conclusion: Although the 10th book in the series, I'd recommend this book as one of the stronger examples of what you're in store for in the series. Reacher gets sucked into a complicated plot and throws himself into the cause of righting wrongs, sometimes by walking a little south of the \"law\" lines. ...more Read few years back may be in 2008.

But still was a good read and put in my Flipkart.com wishlist to purchase his other novels such as The Affair, The Killing Floor and Worth Dying For. The Jack Reacher character is kind of Sherlock Holmes character in deducting clues to be considered but with a killer attitude to fight for justice and ready to make kill for it if required. In this book also he takes the side estranged wife though he has taken the contract from the husband who asks him to find her. Upon finding wrong doings of the husband he stands for justice of estranged wife resulting in killing of some thugs and the husband himself. That's far I remember the concept of the story. Waiting for the upcoming film \"Jack Reacher\" to be released on December 2012 or February 2013. Should see how good Tom Cruise would justify the role of this character? Update: The movie was released as scheduled on December 2012. It is based on \"One Shot\" novel which was released just before this novel in the \"Jack Reacher\" series. I liked the movie very much but it was a very slow pace movie. Tom Cruise is no match for the character's profile but he has given his best. And by the way we can't expect the exactness in the movie adaptations but is an entertaining one. ...more Reacher - a man of no fixed abode - is in New York, a city whose streets and their names he can recall in detail from memory.

By chance, it seems that some nefarious activity Reacher had seen the previous night is of interest to the stranger. Reacher didn't know there was anything suspicious about what he had seen but he can recall everything in detail ... As others have remarked, it is an opening that takes some swallowing. Reacher fans who give the author the benefit of the doubt will press on; those who don't will miss being caught up in the pace and tension of Lee Child's spare, muscular prose. The choice is not easy to make. This is not the best Reacher book. After the iffy opening, it works well enough for threequarters of its length. Then the inevitable one-man-against-the odds successful resolution strains the credulity far more than the opening ever did, and the violence that is part of the Reacher persona becomes gratuitously gruesome. Addicts will cope; newcomers would be better directed to Killing Floor. In passing, it could be remarked that for a man with only one set of clothes, no apparent domicile and a tendency to disappear at the end of each encounter, Reacher has extraordinary success with women. ...more", "Title": "The Hard Way"},
