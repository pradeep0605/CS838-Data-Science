A brilliantly written, totally irreverent helping of broad literary humor for readers who enjoy a good, hearty laugh! ...<---F>more Laughs and Giggles</---F>.

Caution, you may find yourself breaking out in uncontrollable laughter! ...more Well, what can I say? I read the first half of this book thinking, \"\"Wow; this must be very therapeutic for the author! I do hope he's vented enough so that he now feels better!\" Then I read the chapter on the agony uncle comments from genuine questions off the internet. I actually cried with laughter (this takes a lot!). Properly funny!

I actually cried with laughter (this takes a lot!). Properly funny! I was laughing like a wild woman (sitting in my car in my lunch break), looking around in case my colleagues passed by and finally called the 'men in white coats' for me! :-0 From then on, there seemed to be more humour (or maybe something in me had let go of my own tension?). Love the bit on chavs and Argos jewellery! And erego, my husband doesn't have to pretend not to \"look at tits\"! In fact, just this weekend he pointed out a young lady in a service station as she had \"a really round arse!\". Indeed she did, and I too marvelled at how it was one large round orb (not two butt cheeks); just one!? ;-P Also, for the record, I am an adult romance novelist, so hopefully fit into your catgory, but I'm writing a yummy review so surely that counts? :-) This book rants and raves about so many of life's injustices, and dares to say what many would not. Most of us think it, but are too afraid to say it. Again, this is not me. I tend to have verbal diarrhea, and probably am too blunt. But call a spade a spade! (this, in spite of my middle class upbringing!). So; yes. By all means read this book. Share some angst and have a good laugh at it!! The world doesn't laugh enough and it jolly well should! Nice one Karl; you're clearly a diamond geezer! :-) ...more Best not to read this book on the train if you have a full bladder because by the end of your journey you will have a damp patch in an embarrassing place.

Some newspaper editor, somewhere, should pick up this book and offer the author a regular newspaper column, because this is the sort of ironic, no-holds-barred humour that will make your day a lot easier having read it first, or it will banish any end-of-the-world weariness at the close of working hours. Mr Wiggins has views on life that are expressed in a manner worthy of any stand-up comedian. If you want to worry your neighbour by emitting loud hoots of laughter at inappropriate moments I can thoroughly recommend this, genuinely and without hesitation. It's a damn good book. ...more this was not for me. a little too thickly British or something. lots of jokes about hooliganism and \"the Tube\". I don't really care for George Carlin either and I think maybe this guy is the British version.<---C>Karl Wiggins</---C><+++>Calico Jack in your Garden</+++>", "Title": "Calico Jack in your Garden"},
