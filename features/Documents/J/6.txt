That's a recommendation beyond anything I can give it. * * * About a week ago, I went on a car trip with Oot, and we listened to this book together. I see why he liked it. It's very tightly written. Good setting. Good mystery. Two POV characters, one boy and one girl. They each have their own plots, and their own character arcs. Their own problems they struggle to resolve. The boy gets angry sometimes, and his father talks to him about it, and the boy tries throughout the book to get a grip on his anger with varying success. What's more, they both make mistakes. And they're *obviously* mistakes. If only the boy would have told his father about X, things would have gone better. It's kinda the opposite of Harry Potter. It's nice to have that in a kid's book. Anyway. Yeah. Good book. Good Audio. Two thumbs up. One from me, and one from Oot. ...more <+++>The City of Ember</+++> is a young adult novel that is a fantastic allegory for spiritual awakening, though I have no idea if it was intended as such.

The story is of a girl who lives in an underground and completely self-contained city created by the \u201cBuilders.\u201d The population of the city knows of nothing outside the city, in fact, though they speak English many of the words in it like \u201csky\u201d are not understood in any terms but metaphorically. The problem is that the city is falling apart, the lights are going out, the vast stores of supplies of light bulbs, canned food, and vitamins are running out. The reader is in on a worse calamity, namely, that a secret message in a timed lock box that was left by the Builders, which was meant to be handed down from mayor to mayor and that would open just in time to explain to the city dwellers how to get out of the city, was lost many generations back. Well, being a young adult novel it\u2019s pretty predictable in that the box is in our hero\u2019s closet, but a nice turn of events it is found by our hero\u2019s baby sister who chews on it for a while before our hero gets her hands on it leaving the message is only partially legible. So the bulk of the story is the deciphering of the message, followed by the experience of trying to communicate its contents to the adults, who of course don\u2019t accept the message (<---B>where else is there but here?</---B>) which is the equivalent of all prophets experiences of rejection by the status-quo. And finally, there is the adventure of eventual escape. This book reworks the universal theme of Plato\u2019s cave, and of all mysticism. What we think of as the whole universe is but shadow, and further, that to enter that \u201ckingdom of heaven\u201d you must be like a child. The insight that this version of that universal story led me to is part of the answer to why childishness is a necessary component of the transformation. Children haven\u2019t yet become someone. Which means who they are is not yet at stake. For some reason our culture has this question \u201cwhat are you going to be when you grow up?\u201d Think about the hidden structures and assumptions in that question. Who are you? Have you figured it out yet? Is what you do, who you are? Is what you believe who you are? Is who you associate with who you are? I write these questions myself in shadow not in the condition of childishness, and with all of this, as Quaker\u2019s say, \u201ca notion,\u201d i.e. not something that I have experienced, but rather something I think. But this thing that is mostly a notion for me, that the distinction between notional and experiential living is key to awakening, I am begining in small ways to actually experience. ...more DuPrau makes a typical first-time novelist mistake throughout this book: she doesn\u2019t trust her reader to infer. In other words, she often over-explains, following up dialogue and action sequences with redundant descriptions of a character\u2019s take on what just happened.

Another disappointment is that the mystery of Ember unfolds in an entirely predictable manner. There are no great surprises. DuPrau's characterization of Doon is one dimensional. His spurts of rage create the only complexity in an otherwise flat character. Lina, on the other hand, rings true as a 12-year old throughout the book, with one exception: when her grandmother dies, Lina\u2019s grieving process is so brief it feels like the author has ignored something very important. The book\u2019s strongest element was the setting, Ember. Throughout reading the book, I could see the dark, amber lights and the anxious people throughout the city. I hope DuPrau will learn from some of her mistakes and produce a stronger sequel\u2014Ember is rich with possibilities for a greater story. ...more Okay, but excuse me...I THINK MY BOOK WAS MISSING THE FINALE?!?! *collapses screaming* Just so you know, this has a really INTENSE cliffhanger. I have so many questions!! I need book 2 asap!! I really liked this story, I did , but I didn't love it. I had a lot of quibbles? Because I'm a quibbler, okay? And that stops me from bumping it up to a higher rating but I still rather loved it . I also adore the movie and have a sever crush on Lina's shirt. YES. I do. No shame. I love her shirt. THIS SHIRT.

I also adore the movie and have a sever crush on Lina's shirt. YES. I do. No shame. I love her shirt. THIS SHIRT. GIVE IT TO ME, SOMEONE. Ahem. SO I adore that movie and my adoration leaks into my love and enjoyment of this story. It's written really simply...and is very firmly middle-grade. It reminded me a lot of The Giver 's style. Except that this was more wordy. The Giver was all for succulently crisp language, but I felt City of Ember dragged a bit? Like long paragraphs and not so much dialogue. Meh. I found myself skimming at times and had to settle down and read properly. A Brief List of Things I'm Not Fond Of: \u2022 The ending...I like a good cliffhanger. I DO. But it honestly felt like it ended mid-thought. \u2022 I really wish there'd been more between Lina and Doon. I'm not talking romance, HECK NO. I'm talking about more intensity and sparks for their friendship. They honestly felt like \"Eh, we could be friends\" and \"Eh, but maybe we won't be tomorrow...it doesn't even matter to us.\" AND THAT SADDENS ME. I really like strong friendships! \u2022 Poppy....hmm. I think it said she was 2? But she acts WAY younger than that. Her age just wasn't consistent. She was talking okay and then suddenly she could only \"toddle\"?? Then she was dribbling soup like she couldn't chew (??) but then she was scribbling confidently with a pencil, which a small baby wouldn't do. They'd just chew the pencil. SO I DON'T KNOW. I have many baby relatives, but who knows? Everyone is different. \u2022 I did get rather bored a lot. There really isn't a lot of adversary or action. But despite ALL THAT, pfft, whatever. I STILL LIKED IT. Because, for starters, the idea is epic . A dystopian where people are underground and they're relying on stockpiles of tinned food?!? IT IS SOOOO COOOOL. It's like an entire town of Hobbits! (Ahem.) And I love the whole old feel. The book really felt old. With the flickering lightbulbs and the second-hand-everything and the messes. I was just really in the book. And then I loved how Lina was SUCH a good big sister to Poppy. N'awww. Be still my beating heart. It's definitely more Lina's story than Darrow's. Although they do share the narration. I love the names and the jobs and GAH. Just the world is A+ A little more action would've been nice....something to break up the long paragraphs of just description and narration of what they were doing. It needed a bit of a BANG, maybe?? Either way: ME LIKEE DYSTOPIANS AND TINNED FOOD. There is pineapple in this book, of which I highly approve. And I love the premise and GAH I JUST NEED THE NEXT BOOK. Also I need Lina's shirt. So I'm just gonna slip over to Ember and steal that. Brb. (I need to rewatch the movie now...) ...more My 12 year old son just knew I would love this book. He's been hounding me to read it since... early last spring. Finally, I have read it and Jacob (my son) was right. Omigosh.

But then... there is just more and more and more. I especially loved the questioning, like Lina's friend Clary's \"Where does life come from? What is life?\" and Doon's father's words of wisdom that sound strangely familiar: \"What you get is what you get. What you do with what you get, thought... that's more the point...\" and \"Pay close attention to everything, notice what no oneelse notices. Then you'll know what no one else knows, and that's always useful.\" ...more (This is for my book report) \"The City of Ember\" is all about these two regular kids saving their city.

Lina orriginaly got chosen to work in the sewers as a pipework's laborer,but Doon knew being a messenger wouldn't do anything to help save the city, so he traded with Lina.

Doon wasn't the kind of boy who loved sports and computer games, he would rather be a quiet gentleman who paid attention to his bug collection all day long, spending more time at the library than on the couch, so it wasn't normal for Doon to scream to others,\"The city of Ember is not prospering,in fact everything is getting worse and worse by the minute! The lights go out all the time now and the shortages, the shortages are getting low on everything! If no one does anything about it, something terrible is going to happen!\" When Doon and Lina unite together to solve the mysteries of their city, they discover the truths of the past and the present. Some people aren't as trustworthy as they seem to be. When Doon and Lina figure out the last piece of the puzzle, they're stuck. How should the City of Ember know about the great discovery they had made? I would reccomend this book to anyone. ...more Before The Hunger Games (2008) there was The City of Ember (2003). Well, that\u2019s not exactly true because, to be completely honest about it, before HG there were the Japanese novel (1999) and then movie (2000) Battle Royale from which only the blind would say that HG isn\u2019t based upon or at least heavily inspired by. Which, don\u2019t get me wrong, is totally fine; inspiration comes in every shape and form, and if a great book/movie inspired HG author Suzanne Collins to write a great series, then more p Before The Hunger Games (2008) there was The City of Ember (2003). Well, that\u2019s not exactly true because, to be completely honest about it, before HG there were the Japanese novel (1999) and then movie (2000) Battle Royale from which only the blind would say that HG isn\u2019t based upon or at least heavily inspired by. Which, don\u2019t get me wrong, is totally fine; inspiration comes in every shape and form, and if a great book/movie inspired HG author Suzanne Collins to write a great series, then more power to her and more fun to us readers. So all is good;-) Back to CE, the reason why I compare it to HG is because when it came out it was to my knowledge the first post-apocalyptic YA to ever hit the market. In that, DuPrau can only be praised for her originality and avant-gardism. But there the comparison ends. Because if you\u2019re looking for poor kids fighting for survival in a beat-up world, look somewhere else. CE is not about that. At all. Rather, it is more about discovery (both self- and world-), about not taking the truth that\u2019s given to us unquestioningly and instead go and look for another one despite all the obstacles along the way. So again, if you're looking for point-blank survival, full-frontal fights and gruesome deaths, you're not going to get it in this book. In this sense it is a very clean and very-young-reader oriented story, which, however, doesn\u2019t fail to catch the fancy of older readers as well, and thus transcends all age groups. The two main characters, Lina and Doon, are very real, very relatable and very likable; the story is very satisfactory, if somewhat a little slow-paced at times; the writing is very easy-reading and will never make you scratch your head in confusion; finally, the ending is great and will make you want to pick up book 2 right away. Long story short, it\u2019s a winner to me!

So much so that he'd passed them along to his parents, who had read them and found them interesting as well. Add to it a movie coming out and I decided I would give the series a try. The City of Ember exists inside the darkness, where it's always night. Darkness is held at bay twelve hours a day by artifical light, though the electricity is becoming sporadic and the city is running out of replacement bulbs. Founded many years before, there was some instructions on how to leave the darkness left behind but lost by one of the city's mayors. The city is facing shortages of supplies and the residents live in a sense of paranoia that the lights will go out forver, plunging them into enternal darkness. It's a fascinating premise for a novel and one that begs a lot of questions, especially when you find certain things about Ember in the novel's final pages. The story follows two children, Doon and Lina, who have completed their schooling and have been given new jobs. Doon wants to fix the city and trades to have a job in the underside of the city, hoping to explore the mystery of Ember. Lina gets a job as a messenger and is able to run across the city, taking messages back and forth and discovering the full extend of the shortags to come. The two eventually begin to share their knowledge and piece together just what's going on in Ember. They also find a bit of the original instructions and try to fanthom what they mean (Lina's younger sibling eats part of them). Lina and Doon discover there's more going on that meets the eye. The Mayor is a corrupt individual, hoarding resources for himself and seeking to discredit or lock up anyone who discovers otherwise. Lina and Doon are soon on a path to being rebels and forced to flee into the darkness surrounding the City. A fascinating, compelling story that left me with a lot of questions and some good answers. The book is satisfying in that if offers resolution to some questions but leaves the door open for natural follow-ups. ...more I am sort of a late-comer with Young Adult novels. I blame it on my age. When I was a teenager in the 60s there was no real level between children and adult literature. Teen literature was a bit of a no man's land. I didn't realize there might actually be real literature in YA until I read the Harry Potter series. Since then, I've dabble a bit with the genre and discovered some gems: The Hunger Games series, Gaiman's The Graveyard Book , and Dan Wells' John Wayne Cleaver series. Of course there a I am sort of a late-comer with Young Adult novels. I blame it on my age. When I was a teenager in the 60s there was no real level between children and adult literature. Teen literature was a bit of a no man's land. I didn't realize there might actually be real literature in YA until I read the Harry Potter series. Since then, I've dabble a bit with the genre and discovered some gems: The Hunger Games series, Gaiman's The Graveyard Book , and Dan Wells' John Wayne Cleaver series. Of course there are plenty of duds too (Hello, Twilight !). Yet I am more willing to explore in this field than I was before. The City of Ember was our book club pick precisely because some members wanted to add a YA read to our repertoire. I was looking forward to it due to the great press it has receive. If I read this in my teens I would have been Ga-Ga Ape Shit over this book and possibly the entire series. <---A>Jeanne DuPrau</---A> is a very good writer and does a beautiful job in bringing this fantasy city to life. Yet, as an adult and reviewer, I need to relate this to other books in the same genre. While DuPrau kept my attention, the resolution of this story became fairly obvious and, frankly, a little lame if you are familiar with other sci-fi tales. I don't want to give it away but I expected more. I also had some serious logic problems on why the obviously intelligent Builders would devise such a flawed method for delivering a two hundred year old message. Or how the inhabitants of the city never received or never devised portable lights. Fortunately the characters of Lina and Doon were enough to keep me interested and this is where the story gets its success; from the realness and energy of these two adolescents. Nonetheless, compared to books of similar YA genres like The Hunger Games , this novel comes out a little tame. Still, it is a good story and I would have no problems recommending it to a young teen audience. ...more The City of Ember is an engaging children's fiction novel that introduces young readers to courageous characters who take steps to make change happen.

As soon as he finished reading his library copy, he took his allowance money to buy the book so he can own it (I'm SOOOOO proud!). I read this book along with him and I have to say it was pretty good! If you have a young person in your care that needs some reading recommendations, offer this title for them to consider! It is the first of four books so it should keep readers busy for a while. #1: The City of Ember #2: The People of Sparks #3: The Prophet of Yonwood #4: The Diamond of Darkhold The City of Ember: The Graphic Novel Interest Level Grades 6 - 8 Reading Level Grade level Equivalent: 5.1 Lexile\u00ae Measure: 680L DRA: 60 Guided Reading: W Type of Book Chapter Book Genre Mystery and Suspense Fantasy Theme/Subject Family Life Courage, Bravery, Heroism Leadership and Responsibility Friends and Friendship 03/10/2015 What do you do when your fifth grader tells you he's reading the greatest book ever and he wants you to try it?

Review to come...once I finish this strongly recommended book :) ...more Uh... I had to read this for school in grade 5. It was... Ok. The Mayor was despicable. I totally forgot that this book exist. It's been years since I've read this but I can still remember how I enjoyed this one so much. Might do a reread soon :) I didn't realize what the biggest problem with this book was until I had finished it - which, thankfully, only took about an hour from start to finish. The biggest problem is that the entire city, society, economy, and all, feels like it was only created to give the main characters something to do with their time. It seems impossible to me that a city could exist for 200+ years with no innovations, no improvements, no advancements, nothing.

The biggest problem is that the entire city, society, economy, and all, feels like it was only created to give the main characters something to do with their time. It seems impossible to me that a city could exist for 200+ years with no innovations, no improvements, no advancements, nothing. They're all dependent on a dwindling stock of canned goods and panicking about the periodic short-term blackouts (the longest mentioned in the book is 7 minutes) even though the blackouts have been part of life for everyone there as long as they can remember. Even beyond that, it explicitly states that no one in that 200+ years has managed to create *any kind* of portable light. Think about that. Not only are there no flashlights, there are no lanterns. There are no candles. There are no oil lamps. A couple of people manage to catch a stick on fire and wander into the darkness outside the city with it, only to go mad when the stick inevitably burns out - and NO ONE tries any experiments with any other type of flammable substance to see which might last longer, how it might be fueled, or even think about carrying, what, maybe a back-up stick? The thing about humans is that they're always trying to find out \"what happens IF.\" What happens if I combine vinegar and baking soda. What happens if I set my deodorant on fire (don't laugh; my brother actually did this). What happens if I push this big red button. Without any hint that the people of Ember were being controlled by radio waves, or drugs in their food, or hypno-dream-therapy, I find it completely unbelievable that every single one of them would have such a complete lack of curiosity or even just desperation at their existing circumstances that they don't even attempt to see, maybe, what kinds of fungus are edible, or experiment with any of the electrics while they were still in full supply to find out how they really worked. And that brings us to our heroes: the only two people in the history of Ember who seem to have both an understanding of the deterioration of their society AND the impetus to do something about it (besides marching ineffectually with placards in front of the mayor's house - another sign that the general population of Ember is pretty much standing around begging for someone else to save them). This is why I say that the city is basically a straw-man argument - the only reason for it existing the way it does, for the people acting the way they do, is if you have pre-determined that you want to have a couple of twelve-year-old heroes who are the only ones clever enough, brave enough, and determined enough to accomplish anything at all. The rest of the population is just a monotone backdrop to let the two of them stand out even further. ...more I wish I had read this book some time before. Lina and Doon are intelligent and curious, which makes the story interesting. The letter in the end of this book was thrilling to read. This year I rediscovered The City of Ember . Watching the movie with my siblings reminded me how much I loved the books, and I decided to start the series again. This time since I already knew the story I was free to slow down and enjoy every aspect of it. I could feel the impending doom of Ember with the rust and the mold and the damp and the blackouts. I could feel what it was like to hold your breath and count until the lights came back on with the absolute terror of not knowing where you were This year I rediscovered The City of Ember .

I could feel what it was like to hold your breath and count until the lights came back on with the absolute terror of not knowing where you were and what was going to happen next. I didn\u2019t just enjoy Lina and Doon\u2019s attempts to solve the riddle of the torn instructions, instead I was rooting for them to find the way out. Even though this was a fantasy book, the people and place names were never so odd that it detracted from the story but instead it gave the background development of people far removed from regular life but still holding onto aspects of it. Lina and Doon were written as real, live people with loves and hates, worries and hopes, and faults even too. A small metaphor that I had completely missed came out this time and left me smiling. Doon watching a worm build its cocoon and break free, Lina planting a seed and watching it sprout--metaphors of hope. (And a good explanation of the next book\u2019s cover.) The author\u2019s frank writing style still left room for poetry and I found myself experiencing the disorientation of (view spoiler) [using a boat and candles for the first time (hide spoiler) ] and the wonder of (view spoiler) [seeing a brand new day be born (hide spoiler) ] ! I honestly cried at that one. ;) Many readers have noticed the odd references in this book about religion. Side characters are heard wondering if there is a great Being watching over them and saying maybe or maybe not. Doon also wonders where life comes from and knows it\u2019s a power greater than the Builders. The Believers are a group of people that aren\u2019t in the book very much but do have the most \u201cbeliefs\u201d of anyone. They claim to have seen the Builders coming again to \u201cshow them the way\u201d in a dream. Now of course, (view spoiler) [in the story Lina and Doon save the day and the Builders are nowhere to be seen (hide spoiler) ] which is a great case for humanism, isn\u2019t it? Except...the Builders (view spoiler) [did save them. Who wrote the instructions? Left the boats? The candles? And later in the series a few more surprises? (hide spoiler) ] I think it\u2019s positing an interaction between their own efforts and what has been provided for them. It\u2019s really not a huge theme of the book, but I would recommend some parental guidance for younger readers who are not strong in what they believe. Best quote(s): \u201cThe trouble with anger is, it gets hold of you. And then you aren't the master of yourself anymore. Anger is. And when anger is the boss, you get unintended consequences.\u201d \u201cWouldn't it be strange, she thought, to have a blue sky? But she liked the way it looked. It would be beautiful - a blue sky.\u201d I very much enjoyed this book and can\u2019t wait to start re-reading the second one! Definitely a great series. ;) ...more Solo verso la fine si scopre che la protagonista ha 12 anni. Yeeeeeeh. In effetti, \u00e8 scritto un po' troppo semplicemente. This juvenile allegory reminded me greatly of The Giver. Just as at the start of The Giver, the young people of the community of Ember receive their future work assignments, a device which quickly pulls the young reader into the story. Now almost adults, Lina and Doon are able to view their community with fresh eyes, and discover that the generator, the source of electric power on which the town depends, is soon to be exhausted.

Now almost adults, Lina and Doon are able to view their community with fresh eyes, and discover that the generator, the source of electric power on which the town depends, is soon to be exhausted. This will plunge the city into complete darkness. The children discover a secret coded message, leading to a possible escape for the dying town. The heart of the allegory is in the different responses by various citizens to their town's problem: those who deny the problem, those who wait blindly for rescue, those who selfishly hoard as many goods for themselves as they can. It is easy to make application to various groups in our own society. Lina and Doon are among the few who actively search for a positive solution. Even within their own hearts they struggle with conflicts of fear and pride, which might have hindered the saving of the city. An excellent story which made me eager for the next book in the series! ...more I really really love the idea of a post-disaster society of people living underground. And I especially love the idea of reading about that society several generations in, where they no longer remember what daylight is, or why the city they live in is theren- or even where exactly their city is.

I like the idea of this society making up their own myths about 'the dark' and having new origin stories and singing songs amid candles lit against the ever-present night. However, all those enchanting pieces of The City of Ember are just tiny footnote details in what's really a fairly decent adventure story. The setting of an underground sort of steampunk like society surviving post-collapse without any connections to their past is merely the place where this book begins. I really enjoyed this story, and am excited to read more in the series, but I wish this book had been about twice as long and had about three times the depth. I really feel like the author here was on the verge of creating a whole new world, maybe not with the intricacy and pull of the Harry Potter universe, but something heading in that direction. Instead everything - setting and plot and characters et cetera - is at a pretty basic level and merely serves as the dressing around the main story, which is a somewhat didactical examination of the ills of society and scarcity mentality hidden inside an engaging adventure story of two plucky pre-teens trying to save their people. ...more A terrific book, simply and beautifully written.

Anyway, as soon as I started reading it I couldn't stop. It's one of those books that you cant put down. Infact I have been late for school a few days because I stay up so late reading it.

From what i've read so far it is about a girl who lives in a strange city called Ember, where there is no such thing as the sun. The whole city is lit by lights. Because 300 years ago, people called the builders decided to create the place. Ember is now in danger of dying away, because all the supplies are running out (the builders built giant storage places and filled them with supplies) And nobody knows how to make anything themselves. Another problem is the generator, recently their have been frequent power failures that last only minutes, but without the power their is no way to see, or do anything. Then one day the main girl finds a strange letter that seems to have been written by the builders. I wont say anymore, as to not spoil it. ...more This was my first book to read on the Kindle.

It has great character-building, interesting story, and also the concept of Ember itself is intriguing. Note; one star off for being slow at times that I find myself struggling to finish it. Would recommend to people who love a good YA dystopian novel without any insta-love thrown in. Been wanting to read this for a long time. I saved the movie in my DVR forever because I prefer to read the book first. Enjoyed it but it ends pretty open so I'll definitely need to continue with the series. 3.5 stars The city of Ember was built as a last refuge for the human race.

I suppose The City of Ember would be a good choice for children (9-13 years old) and if I was younger I would appreciate it much more. My main problem? I was almost always step ahead of Lina and Doon and I could see where the story was going. Sometimes I also couldn't suspend my disbelief. No, I don't mean the \"two children are going to save the world the city\" thing, because I'm quite used to this and I can overlook it, when the book is good. However, how long would you mourn when your beloved family member would die? How far can you throw something? The end was totally far-fetched - at first Lina's unbelievable stupidity (view spoiler) [when she forget to pass the letter and then the throw. (hide spoiler) ] However, I did like that I could rest from a romance for a while. It's tiresome and sticky to see it in almost every new YA book. I will sum up all my feelings: The concept is fabulous, yet it lacked unexpected turns and twists, the writing is smooth, but simple and it reads fast, still you are left with dissatisfied taste on your tongue. ...more I had never heard of these books or the film ;). I was told the movie even had a serious amount of commercial PR across the board; guess I was under a rock that year. Either way I enjoyed this book. It set a unique foundation for the books to come; it was really entertaining and enjoyable. Which isn\u2019t that the goal for books? The film felt jumbled though, as if they took all the chapters of the book and randomized them to the point that no chapter could touch each other on sequence.

At the end, having crap from chapter one for instance, then they throw in a bunch of random crap; I did like Bill Murray as the mayor though. I swear no matter the role, in newer movies at least, I also think of him in Zombieland, ha. I did feel it to be really childish, but after finished the 2nd one I don\u2019t see it as that so much anymore. Not so much the story just the writing. I can\u2019t complain though because it is after all YA. That aside I was really hard pressed to predict or figure any of this out ahead of it all happening, which is always fantastic for me. Another high-five for my goodreads friends though because without them I would have never of found these gems. If you are on the fence about reading it or all of them, do it, you\u2019ll be glad.

For instance, Lina\u2019s grandmother dies, and she hardly seems to notice. Some things about the writing annoyed me, but I cannot recall the specifics now. Otherwise, I enjoyed the story. It flowed well. It\u2019s an interesting concept. It\u2019s disconcerting reading about a civilization that expects the world to be pitch black. I was a bit nervous for them the whole time, as I am not really a fan of the dark, and I can imagine the fear and chaos bubbling under the surface when your whole existence is about to be snuffed out once the electricity and supplies run out. I really like that it encourages curiosity and praises stepping outside your comfort zone. I\u2019m also glad the author shows how difficult this can be and how much faith it can take to go into the unknown. It also comes with the customary Great Life Lessons for Young Readers, such as boo for anger, greed and unhealthy ambition. Worthy lessons all, and not too heavy handed I didn\u2019t think. ...more There are some books which, when you read them, hold you in a spell with their unique charm and voice. This was one of those children's books, read at a time in which I devoured everything considered suitable reading. I've never read the sequels however as the way in which this book ended was left open to my imagination and to continue in such a way would ruin the magic of this novel. Recommended out of that nostalgic time known as childhood. 28/12 - I had a whole plan of what I was going to read, and when, going into the new year, but this has thrown a wrench into those plans.

I had been looking forward to reading this for months, watching as it moved its way up through my suspended holds list, finally reaching the top yesterday. It wasn't until it became available to 'pick up' after being on hold for about nine months that I realised that the book I had put on hold all those months ago had turned into an eBook without me even being notified. I'm not much of an eBook fan and I was a little grumpy about the fact that I was being forced to read it in digital form rather than the expected paperback, especially as I only get a week to read it instead of three and it can't be renewed at all instead of up to two times. Plus, as I said, I had a plan and an eBook that needs to be read immediately before all other books will screw that plan up quite badly. The one thing this book has going for it at the moment is that it's quite short, so shouldn't take too long to read, fortunately, because my next library book is due back two days after this is, and then the next one after that is due two days after that . I'm going to be busy! To the book itself...I have seen the movie a couple of times and enjoyed it enough to give it a rating of 3.5 to 4 stars. As long as neither of the main characters have annoying internal monologues I believe that this will be a solid 3.5 to 4 star rating, my feelings likely matching my feelings on the movie. To be continued... 30/12 - Both Lina's grandmother and Doon's father sound like serious hoarders, and I should know I'm a big fan of Hoarding: Buried Alive. I watch the show for educational purposes and in an attempt to learn the signs that I'll need to watch out for as I get older and the one main obstacle stopping me from becoming a full-blown book hoarder, my mum, gets older herself. But, with the fact that Ember citizens rarely throw anything out I imagine the whole city are hoarders, and that's better than throwing something out only to find that it would be useful a few days down the track ( see , that's pure hoarder talk - I sympathise with the hoarder's plight, especially if they're hoarding books which will eventually be my downfall). Later - This is clearly not really meant for adults, or even young adults, unless young adults start at around the age of nine. YA tends to have hints (or complete whitewashes) of romance and more adult themes than the natural death of a grandparent or the corruption of government. The language is far simpler than I would expect from a book aimed at 15 - 20-year-olds and events or items (that are found in the City of Ember) are explained much more extensively than what a teenager should need. There are also a number of 'lessons' the characters, and through them the readers, are learning, and it's not like the lessons are in any way subtle - the book tells you quite clearly what the right way to behave is, and what isn't. Lina is learning that \"sometimes it was a good thing to go fast and sometimes not\", and Doon is learning that \"when anger is the boss you get unintended consequences\". Both direct (or close enough) quotes from the book. To be continued... Later - Huh! That ended abruptly. I thought it was the end of the penultimate chapter, not the end of the book. I guess it doesn't help when the movie doesn't end that way, not being made to be a trilogy, as the book was. But still, that didn't feel like the end of the first book in a trilogy, it felt like the end of a chapter 3/4 of the way through the first book in a trilogy. I guess a complete and utter cliff hanger (if ever I saw one) is a really good way to get your readers immediately desperate to pick up the next book in the series. No older child/young teenager could possibly hold out weeks or even months before reading the next book, their attention span isn't nearly long enough. Anyway, I enjoyed the book, but found it a little simplistic in the language and slightly preachy with its messages. As I said, it ends with a horrible cliff hanger so it won't be long before I get my hands on the next book in the trilogy. ...more Great book!
