It's great for book club discussions as it brings many messages and lessons in a delightful, hot, intriguing, captivating and bewitching plot. Yes! All those words, yet not enough. From the very beginning, from the first book, this trilogy pulled me in to a world of steamy sex, mystery, pain and suffering. Right from the start, I knew that the three characters were very troubled. I was spellbound and lost in Ethan's sad story and I felt deeply connected with Sophia and her inner turmoil and strongly attached to Alistair, the rugged, tortured Highlander, (<---B>view spoiler</---B>) [who lost a daughter but could not cry. (hide spoiler) ] I was intrigued by their many dark secrets and when I though I had solved one of the mysteries... BOOM! Another twist made me breathless. At every page turned, I wanted to get more inside their heads: to find out what's behind the woman who's so emotionally fragile that she couldn't see her own mistakes, and hid her dark secrets with lies and a false identity. Then, there's Ethan, who is equally traumatized by what has happened in his childhood and teenage years. I just really wanted to reach out and give that poor rich guy an embrace and tell him everything was going to be okay... When Alistair was brought into the picture, I almost gagged, thinking here we were go... the same old clich\u00e9: the super dreamy, panty-dropping, unbelievably gorgeous god who is every woman's fantasy come true. But he is so much more broken than Sophia and Ethan that there was no possibility of that happening. In fact, there are no cliches in this trilogy, but a new surprise at every page. Full of literary references, I traveled around the world, rocked by classic music and rock, drunk on superb wines, champagnes and whisky; the sadness and happiness so poignant that even though the characters are surrounded by luxury, it fades away in emotions, becoming only a background set, lavishly written, by the way. Have a sharpened pencil by your side to highlight these books, a box of tissues to dry your tears (and why not: a boyfriend to ensure you're kept as satisfied as Sophia). The secondary cast is spectacular! The cute, intelligent Gabriela; the arrogant and sweet Tavish Uilleam, the generic, sensual Barbara, the friendly Leonard, and so many more: Ethan's parents, Sophia's siblings, Alistair's family... The good guys, the bad guys... They were all so wonderfully crafted that they support the leading characters without robbing the scene (apart maybe from Tavish Uilleam in the last book.) There were quite a few suspenseful, heart-pounding moments, especially in the second and third books, and there were some where I felt like my heart was going to be ripped out of my chest. I laughed; I cried a lot, but mostly I was angry. Especially, I was angry at what happened to Alistair and Ethan. I was angry that no matter how good you are, how careful or even how wealthy, bad things will still find you. I hate that there are heartless and cruel people in the world as the ones you're going to meet in the last book. It's disgusting that the butterfly effect is real and that it can cause a domino effect and ruin the lives of others. But when I got to about four-fifths of the way through, I was starting to get scared that the ending would tear me to shreds. It did... but still it was epic. I felt the characters, the books and the author growing inside me but still I can't wrap my head around how it went from THAT beginning to THAT ending. What happened, for Christ's sake? It left me thinking about life for hours after I put it down. Savor this book... Read it slow, or fast, but let the messages sink in. And then read it again. Wow!! This is it. I have nothing more to say, risking more spoilers, then except: JUST READ IT ALREADY!!! At last, I have to thank the author for letting me review her book. It was an amazing surprise and it has become one of those books I treasure, that I would just reread over and over and never tire of the story. ...more A round of applause for <---A>Cristiane Serruya</---A>. The best adult erotic contemporary trilogy I have ever had. Just a small warning: This has more than sex. This trilogy has a story that should be read in full to be understood. There is pain, angst, sex, love triangle, thriller, mystery, and a lot of meaning in all the scenes (even on the sex scenes). They are not just there for escapism, they are there to be understood. Each and every one. (I read it again, yes!) It is one of those series that keeps you glued until the end and then once it gets over, you wonder where your life is finally headed to !

I sit thinking about the joy and sorrow of the very lives led by the characters of the book. Suddenly there was a void.

The demons from within each one of them were finally released, but at what cost? Love, as they say it, is all-sacrificing and all-consuming. Or is it? Love can be an obsession that can endanger one's life. Heat,passion and a million other expressions and feelings are no doubt described to the finest detail in this final installation of the <+++>Trust</+++> Trilogy but what I urge you reader, is to reach to the deeper layers of it. The best part about this series is the in-depth exploration of the human psyche by the author. She has played with the thought processes of the characters very intelligently and each character is a winner here- in one or the other way. I would always remain indebted to this author for bringing to the notice of the reader, the widely debated but little answered problem of women empowerment - be it at home or at the workplace. What I found amazing is the fact that she gives startling details and shocks the reader by pinpointing issues that grapple to be heard all across the world but are silently throttled in ways we might never even notice. This is more than a tale of love, sacrifices and devils of the mind. It's a rediscovery of one's own self in ways we would never know that our minds functioned in! P.S. For a new reader of Erotica, this would be a high dose. But be bold enough to venture deeper rather than passing scornful and shocked expressions.

Expect romance, hot sex scenes, thriller, and lots of drama (and a bit of tragedy, especially on the last book). Don't go to bed with this book, because you'll be awake for a whole night. I must tell you: This doesn't happen until chapter four of A New Beginning (book one), more or less, then BAM! pace picks up and doesn't let you down until your eyelids are closing on their own. You will be kept reading, guessing, and the twists and turns and cliff-hangings will make you sit ramrod straight on the your bed until you hear the birds singing! The style: Mrs. Serruya has a superb way of writing. It's different. It's elegant. It's classic and contemporary! It's hot. (I usually laugh or cringe at sex scenes, but the author made me feel like I was a... voyeur... *blushing* or even... as if I was participating on the scene. Masterful!) She has an amazing talent with descriptions and does a great job twisting her words. She writes flawlessly and makes the readers feel as if an engaging film is passing in front of their eyes. However, it's the masterful, smart writing that sets this trilogy apart. There are so many messages between the lines that I had to read it twice. And I'll probably read it a third. The story: This is the story of three billionaire human beings - very different from whatever billionaire character you have read so far. Sophia, Ethan & Alistair have crossed paths in a not only a billionaire, but also noble Europe, in the last months of 2009 and beginning of 2010. All three have dark secrets in their pasts. All three are in desperate need of love, but they don't know it (or they don't want to acknowledge it). Who will win the prize of love? Although I'm pretty sure some readers will disagree with me, I think the three of them have! (view spoiler) [I loved how the author chose the end of one of the characters, it's not what some may call a HEA but... it's a HEA... I just can't explain how. (hide spoiler) ] The books themselves: Book one is baroque, yes. Like a Harlequin Romance with steamy scenes & slow rides. The descriptions are so well done that I felt transported to their world. Details sing in all the right ways. I wouldn't and couldn't stop reading. Book two is less baroque and focus more on the present/past/present and on characters' psychologic side, deepening and peeling what has been laid for readers on book one, like rose petals rotting and falling down to show you the characters' bared souls, with steamy scenes and romance, and no slow rides. Pages fly like a autumn leaves in a whirlwind. I went into this book expecting much, yes, and - wow! I was wrong. Betrayed is even better than A New Beginning. And it is even hotter than the first one. So many revelations and so many angst and dark scenes. Through Sophia's, Alistair's and Ethan's past and dark secrets, much is revealed and explained. Book three is even more like a thrilling roller-coaster, as the readers' doubts and fears are being knotted and untied to end this trilogy in a beautiful way. If I could describe the three books put together: the book one begins the ascendence of a roller-coaster, books two & three will take you on a ride you will never forget! When it ends, you'll run to the queue again (or the first page) anticipating the thrills of the ride. The characters: Ethan was the character that surprised me the most. I honestly hated him in the first book. I pitied him in the second book, after all I was told about his past, but still he hasn\u2019t found the way to my heart. But from this third book on, he turned out to be a great guy and I, who didn\u2019t care for him, I fell in love with Ethan. He redeemed himself in a spectacular way and if I could, I would hold him in my arms and hug him. How Cristiane Serruya did it, I\u2019m still wondering. That is what I call supreme talent. Alistair Oh, Alistair Connor\u2026 Alistair Connor is also a complex character, but I never found it hard to connect with him as I did with Ethan. In spite of hating him in the end of the first book, he is the perfect, sexy, tortured Highlander. At all times he was honest with the reader, but he held a lot of things back inside himself, in a control-freak way, keeping me wanting and waiting for him to show it all, until his dam broke in a heartbreaking, magnificent scene. Sophia How can you describe a perfect character with so many flaws? Sophia is one that is too good to be true - so good, you may not like her at first - but as the mask comes off, she is just like one of us, just wanting to be loved. She is the friend every one needs; the professional every woman wants to be; the mother every girl wishes she had; the woman every man desires; the human being every one wishes to be... And yet, I shook my head at Sophia in many moments and was flabbergasted at her dark secret (view spoiler) [I didn't judge her on it; not for one second, although the secret is pretty dark (hide spoiler) ] and some unnecessary masks she wore. Gabriela and Tavish Uilleam. These two secondary characters are as important as the three leading ones in this book. They link the leading relationships in such amazing scenes, that without them the plot wouldn\u2019t be the same. I could go on and on, but I would spoil the twists and turns of the story for you, so: this whole trilogy is about relationship, redemption, trust, love, good, evil, actions, consequences and life, with the hot, steamy sex scenes linking the emotions all together and not compromising the story, as they are in their right place and perfect moments, written in an erotic way to showcase the feelings, not only the sex in itself. I cannot forget to mention the therapeutic sessions. OMG! I wish I had just one psychologist as insightful as Mina or Andrew in my whole life. They are just great! The engaging and impressive carefulness of how Cristiane wrote her plot, especially some specific scenes, even the heartbreaking ones, is astounding, because it seems as real as if Ethan, Sophia and Alistair were there with all their love and drama occupying my daily life and yet, like friends, they leave the right, necessary space to let me think about mine. This whole trilogy is pure truth within a loud silence. As Dr. Volk told Alistair (in Pandora's Box): Sometimes, silence speaks louder than words. Just because it is peaceful, it doesn\u2019t mean it is still and void, as a few may think. It is insightful, powerful and full of meaning. It is when one can\u2019t lie to oneself. You have to learn to listen to what she is not saying. Listen to her silence. And listen to yours, too. This book ruined me for all the others left to read. Easily my favorite of 2014 and all the three books of the trilogy made it to top five of all times, so I'm already mourning the loss of these characters and anxiously awaiting for more novels by Cristiane Serruya. I have to thank my friend, Alberto, for having introduced me to Goodreads and to A New Beginning (book one). Last, I have to thank the sweet author of this amazing trilogy, for letting me beta read for her Pandora's Box (book three). I feel that this trilogy have changed my life! I read the last book twice as a beta reader for the author, and another one just for myself. If not enough, I bought the whole trilogy when it came out to read it again as one of my favorite books. I\u2019m still mesmerized by its events. It's the best trilogy I have ever had the pleasure to read.
