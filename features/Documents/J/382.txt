I keep reading her books, hoping that something will change for the better. So far, nothing had. This book is about gargoyles and demons. But don't get the wrong impression. It's less this: And more this: This is standard Armentrout in that: 1. The main heroine is the star of the show , there is no doubt about it, the universe revolves around her and only her 2. There is slut-shaming . There is an ample shortage of meaningful female friendship , there is plenty of slutty girls around, including her best friend, all designed to make the heroine seem virginal, chaste, and pure in contrast 3. The heroine is special, different , one of a kind, due to only the fact that she was born to an extraordinary heritage; she does nothing to earn our respect 4. There is a love triangle , and further than that, almost every eligible person with a penis around her age range wants her milkshake 5. There is more flirting than plot 6. The heroine is supposed to be kick-ass, but she is rescued all the fucking time The good: 1. The writing is enjoyable, the book itself is a light, quick read 2. The setting is a predictable, light, traditional Urban Fantasy with characters we don't see too often---gargoyes (<---B>but the book still needs more garrgoyles and less hot-men-outside-of-stone-form</---B>) The Summary : Gargoyles exist. They are called Wardens. 10 years ago, they came out in public. The world knows that gargoyles exist now, and there's surprisingly little hullabaloo about it. Miley Cyrus twerkin' on Robin Thicke's crotch got a more shocked reaction than we were shown in this book. ...the Wardens went public ten years ago. The Alphas had ordered the Wardens to come out of the shadows. To humans, Wardens had come out of their stone shells. After all, the gargoyles adorning many churches and buildings had been carved to resemble a Warden in his true skin. Huh, gargoyles exist. Ok. <---C>Layla</---C> is 17 years old. She is beautiful, but doesn't really consider herself that pretty. I mean, Layla only looks like an elf-princess. What's so special about that? Zayne said I looked like the long-lost sister of the elf in Lord of the Rings. That was a huge confidence booster. Sigh. Sigh, indeed. Fuck, it must be so horrible to go through life all blonde and elfin, looking like Legolas' sister. Tough existence, man. To top it off, she's in love with a gorgeous Warden guy (Zayne) who only sees her as a sister. A really hot sister with whom he loves going on coffee dates. Layla is special. She is half-Demon, half-Warden. She looks like a human and she cannot shift into a monster-like stone gargoyle form because she is a half-blood. Therefore, Layla is half-blood, all beautiful. Special without the ugly side effects of being a gargoyle-like Guardian. Layla is an orphan (oh hello there, trope). She has amnesia (trope). She doesn't know anything about her birth or her parents (trope). Her Warden guardians keep everything a secret from her (trope). One day, while stupidly chasing down a minor demon into a dark alley, Layla nearly gets killed. She is rescued by a dark, handsome, sexy Upper Level Demon. His name is Roth. He has a snake named Bambi. I don't mean to say his penis is named Bambi, I mean he has a snake tattoo that comes to life whose name is Bambi. No\u2014not a mass, but a huge freaking snake at least ten feet long and as wide as I was. The thing spun toward me, rising halfway up. Its eyes burned an unholy red. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared of Bambi,\u201d the demon said. \u201cShe\u2019s only curious and maybe a little bit hungry.\u201d The thing was named Bambi? Sexy Demon Roth starts showing up everyfuckingwhere Layla goes. She goes to school. He's there. He shows up whenever she needs help, like a demonic guardian angel. Where I'm from, we call that a fucking stalker . Layla knows that. She trusts him anyway. \u201cYou don\u2019t? I was following you.\u201d \u201cOh, so you\u2019re a demon and a stalker?\u201d I swallowed hard. \u201cBecause that\u2019s not creepy or anything.\u201d Oh, he's not just a stalker, he's a pervert, too. He leaned in again, his lips brushing the curve of my cheek. \u201cLet me suggest more appropriate places. I have this piercing\u2014\u201d Oh, wait, there's a reason he's following her. Layla is special. She was born to a special destiny, and he was meant to protect her. Roth let out a low breath. \u201cYour mother was known by many names...And because of that, you\u2019re on Hell\u2019s Most Wanted List.\u201d Naturally, Layla is inclined to believe the stranger she just met over the people who have raised her for the past 10 years. Roth and Layla kiss, they flirt, they go out on dates. They spend nights together, staring longingly into each other's eyes. They go to bed together---but they just talk, because demons are such gentlemen that way. What is The Lesser Key of Solomon? More importantly, will the two hot, gorgeous men in her life ever stop fighting over Layla? Zayne\u2019s grip relaxed. \u201cShut up.\u201d Roth came to his feet fluidly. \u201cI don\u2019t think I like your tone.\u201d \u201cAnd I don\u2019t like your face,\u201d Zayne returned. The amount of testosterone the two were throwing off was ridiculous. The Girl-Hate : There's room for only one good girl in this book, and that girl is Layla. Layla is virginal, pure. Layla and her best friend Stacey tease each other by calling each other names. Stacey is, of course, presented as the slut, the hobag , while innocent Layla is the virgin . Stacey only blinked, looking like she was coming out of some kind of bizarre trance. I scribbled hobag across her notes. She laughed and wrote virgin ice princess across mine. Even an insult, a tease, is designed to make Layla look good against her slutty best friend Stacey. Stacey is sex on wheels. Stacey started to tug her shirt up as a shield, but must\u2019ve realized there wasn\u2019t enough material there. She dresses sexily, and the book presents it to us as a bad thing. Stacey was saying as she threw herself into her seat. \u201cI didn\u2019t sneak out of the house dressed like this for no good reason.\u201d \u201cNo doubt.\u201d I eyed her short skirt and then her cleavage. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want your boobs to go to waste.\u201d Stacey constantly makes sexual jokes and gestures. \u201cGreat!\u201d Stacey chirped, backing off and gesturing wildly behind Roth. She was doing something with her hand and mouth that I knew Roth would be oh so down for. She is presented as a good friend, but so completely hypersexualized compared to Layla. Her character is insiduously presented as not as good, due to her sexualization. The other female characters in the book are either stupid sluts (Eva, the glammed up hobag Mean Girl classmate) or a scared female Warden (never mind that she's also a badass warrior herself), or a nice, beautiful Warden girl who's meant to be hated because of her interest in Layla's first love, Zayne. Danika is nice, but everything she does is seem as mean, an attack on Layla when all she wants to do is be helpful. I dumped the stuff in the garbage can, shoulders stiff. \u201cI\u2019m not going to jump on you and suck out your soul, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about.\u201d Danika gasped. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant\u2014not at all. It\u2019s just that you look like you need something and I want to help.\u201d Everytime a female character outside of Layla does something remotely normal and nice, Layla snaps at her. There is no room in this book for a positive female figure besides Layla. The Setting : It's your traditional Urban Fantasy, with Angels, Demons, all that good stuff. This book breaks no molds in the setting. It is completely predictable in this sense, and that's just fine. We have Fiends, we have Posers (demons, heh), we have Zombies. Nothing out of the ordinary. What I do not like : The setting in this book is anticlimactic. There are gargoyles, humans know they exist...and there's an odd sense of \"so what?\" about it. People aren't exactly freaking out. There's a church rallying against Wardens... Every so often the Church of God\u2019s Children held a rally against the Wardens and then made headlines. They\u2019d been doing it ever since the public had found out about the Wardens\u2019 existence. And that's the last we hear about it. The book is so centered around Layla and Layla only, so much that the outside world becomes completely secondary and almost gathers no mention in the book. The setting itself has gaps. There are Wardens...gargoyles...but almost no instance of actual gargoyles in the book. We rarely see the Wardens in action. It's more internal politics and living with the Wardens in human form than anything else. There's also the unbelievable case of \"OH HUMANS KNOW ABOUT WARDENS BUT LET'S HIDE THE FACT THAT DEMONS EXIST!\" Wut? The world would descend into chaos if humans knew demons were ordering their morning coffee right alongside them. Ok, so you're telling me that the world is ok with the existence of gargoyles, that stone men can come to life, but they'd completely freak out if they knew about the existence of demons? Wut? Layla, you've got me on my knees : *lyric from Eric Clapton* Everyone with a dick loves Layla. From hot, protective brother-figure Zayne. Zayne, who always wants to reassure Layla that she is good, despite what Layla thinks of herself. Zayne\u2019s eyes flicked up. They seemed brighter than usual. \u201cYou\u2019re...perfect just the way you are.\u201d To schoolboy Gareth. \u201cWow, he is so checking you out.\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d I looked at Stacey. \u201cWho?\u201d She glanced over her shoulder as she pulled me closer. \u201cThe guy you almost plowed into\u2014Gareth Richmond. He\u2019s still checking you out.\" To evil pervert Petr who wants her body. The line of his jaw hardened. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong? I told you to stop and you wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d \u201cYou were being a tease.\u201d His voice dropped low. \u201cAnd since when do demons really get a say in anything?\u201d To Roth. Roth, who only has eyes for Layla. Oh, the love triangle ... \u201cI...\u201d I didn\u2019t know. I loved Zayne, but I didn\u2019t know what kind of love that was, and Roth... I thought I could be in love with him, if given time. Or maybe I already was, in a little way. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d It's enjoyable, but only as brain candy. If you're looking for more plot, more substance, I wouldn't recommend this. The character development and plausibility of the plot is absolutely lacking. ...more I. Could. Not. Finish. This. I tried.

It's boring. And you know what else perfection is? It's all tell and no fucking show. So this girl - Layla - is amazing, right? She's so SPESHUL. Gifted. Wonderful. Beautiful. We are told all of this and yet never shown examples of it. She's special because she was born into it, not because she does any damn thing to prove it. She's amazing, we are told, but I'm still uncertain what's really so special about her in action. Everyone wants this girl, we are told, but god only knows why. Oh, and she's totally badass... apparently. Maybe I would have noticed if she wasn't so busy being saved all the time. Then there's that love triangle *yawn*. I think the descriptions of men are often what separate the romance stories I actually enjoy from the ones that bore me to tears. To be honest, there's a part of me that thinks \"yeah, okay, whatever\" with this whole male perfection malarkey. These men/boys are beautiful in every way. They are fucking perfect. Their bodies are sculpted awesomeness of muscle and unblemished skin. Their hair falls perfectly in gorgeous thick waves. Their faces were built by angels and they always have a sexy phrase handy to raise the heat levels in any given scene. But I suppose it's hard to criticise this trend when you compare it to the airbrushed, photoshopped and hairless beauties shown in men's magazines. Why shouldn't women get their fantasy perfection? No reason I can see. Except... it's fucking boring . These men are too perfect for me to care about and fall in love with. I cannot believe in that level of perfection. They are male Barbie dolls, straight off the factory production line. Polished, flawless, perfection . I'd find it easier to love them if they were ugly. I'd also find it easier to love them if Layla took a break from describing their physical perfection for a second and gave them a personality that goes beyond trying to get in her pants (like every male in this book). So many times I felt like me and Layla were having this exchange... Me: Plot? Layla: Fuck the plot. Let's make out! There's also a whole bunch of slut-shaming, which I assume is only supposed to emphasise the heroine's purity and goodness. Even her best friend seems like a tool constantly being used to reinforce the MC's good girl persona - her characterisation consists almost solely of her overt sexuality and revealing outfit choices. If the female character is not Layla or a \"slut\", then she's the evil bitch who has a thing for one of the guys. Then I come to some of the ridiculous dialogue between the characters. Look, I know teenagers can be annoying. Insufferable, some might say. Sometimes I read the diaries I wrote from when I was 15 and, oh my god, the angst! It burns! They're hilarious and melodramatic, of course. But still, high school wasn't that long ago for me. And the dialogue between the teens in this book is like what middle-aged adults *think* teenagers might say. Stacey groaned. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Mr. Leto wouldn\u2019t let us do our classics report on Twilight. It is a classic.\u201d No one says that. No one. Plus, Twilight isn't even \"cool\" among high school teens. Twilight , if it is talked about, is the thing girls whisper and giggle about behind their hands. Kids do not announce loudly and openly that Twilight is a classic. And don't even get me started on all the male posturing going on, it was laughable. My favourite was this bit: Zayne\u2019s grip relaxed. \u201cShut up.\u201d Roth came to his feet fluidly. \u201cI don\u2019t think I like your tone.\u201d \u201cAnd I don\u2019t like your face,\u201d Zayne returned. The amount of testosterone the two were throwing off was ridiculous. The thing I find so funny is that this is considered some big, testosterone-fuelled alpha male battle. It sounds more like the fights me and my sister have over music in the car. Maybe you should read this book if you want a good laugh. I'm sorry, guys. I know a lot of people love Armentrout and this could be a light, entertaining read for you if you like all her usual elements. But I find it all too formulaic, recycled and... boring. I wish the hype for her books was easier to resist. ...more You know what I've figured out? <---A>Jennifer L. Armentrout</---A> is a panderer. Meaning, she always writes the same formulaic stuff and always has to have extremely hot, six-foot-something bad boys that are there to solely make the main character's--and the young teen female reader's--panties melt.

What do I have to say to that? Well, first of all, Secondly, here are a few examples of her not-even-a-little-bit-subtle pattern: Taken from the blurb of Wait for You : \"Cameron Hamilton is six feet and three inches of swoon-worthy hotness, complete with a pair of striking blue eyes and a remarkable ability to make her want things she believed were irrevocably stolen from her. She knows she needs to stay away from him, but Cam is freaking everywhere, with his charm, his witty banter, and that damn dimple that\u2019s just so\u2026 so lickable. Getting involved with him is dangerous , but when ignoring the simmering tension that sparks whenever they are around each other becomes impossible , he brings out a side of her she never knew existed.\" Taken from the blurb of her new book Wicked : \"Ren Owens is the last person Ivy expected to enter her rigidly controlled life. He\u2019s six feet and three inches of temptation and swoon-inducing charm. With forest-green eyes and a smile that\u2019s surely left a stream of broken hearts in its wake, he has an uncanny, almost unnatural ability to make her yearn for everything he has to offer. But letting him in is as dangerous as hunting the cold-blooded killers stalking the streets. Losing the boy she loved once before had nearly destroyed her, but the sparking tension that grows between them becomes impossible for Ivy to deny. Deep down, she wants\u2026 she needs more than what her duty demands of her, what her past has shaped for her.\" And I don't think I need to discuss the blurb of this one. There's fucking two hot--and I quote once more, \"swoon-worthy\" --guys. A love triangle, a.k.a. the YA trope that practically screams \"cash grab\". Okay, I get that all of this pays the bills and all, and that's fine. Everyone's gotta eat. Do whatcha gotta do and all that jazz. But I'm definitely no longer a fan of hers now that I've got a feel of what she's all about. I'd rather support authors who are willing to take risks and think outside of the box (e.g. Eliza Crewe and Leah Raeder , upon recent memory) rather than strictly follow a formula for the sole purpose of filling their pockets. I'm sure she's a lovely person, but as an author she brings nothing new to the table. In fact, she does the exact opposite of that. She pulls out all the old tricks and tries to fluff 'em up as best as possible. To me that's just not cute. It makes her seem like, as an author, she's all about the money money money. What makes me sad is that it's not just Jen here who does this. Not even close. This has been a trend in YA for years, and thanks to Emily May's NA Experiment , I pretty much stay away from new adult books in general due to the fact that nearly every NA book follows this formula. They're there to pander, and \"originality\" is not in their vocabulary. What crushes me is that this kinda shit sells . They sell like hot cakes, and because of this, it's rubbing off even more on YA as well--case in point, this book right here. Again, before you fans rip me apart, I have nothing against her as a person. She seems like a nice lady. I'm strictly viewing her as an author and the clear pattern that her work shows. I have to call a spade a spade. Sorry 'bout it. P.S. Shout out to all the authors out there who do your thing and don't conform. You have no idea how valuable you guys are.

I love JLA and all her previous paranormal stories. But this one did not live up to my expectations. So what was my biggest problem with this book? It wasn't the love triangle or the fact that heroine was perfect example of damsel in distress. No. It was the fact that most of the banters and dialogues between characters were super-cheesy and childlish. There were so many clich\u00e9s it wasn't even funny. And action was almost non-existent or really boring. It took 80% (and whole week of reading) until I was at least a bit hooked in the story. And that was just too late for me. When it comes to \"love triangle\" in this book, there was only one guy for me. And after reading this book, I am Team Roth all the way. Zayne who? Roth was definitely the best part of this book. A big contradiction. Cocky and arrogant, yet caring and self-sacrificing. I really enjoyed those parts of the book when he was present. However, question remains. Who will win Layla's heart at the end? I am definitely curious to see how will this series develop and what direction will JLA take it. Last couple of chapters proved, that she knows how to capture my attention with her writing. She will have her chance with book #2 to either win me over or lost me forever when it comes to The Dark Elements.

The existence of demons and Wardens (Gargoyles who protect mankind from demons) is a thing that very much catches attention. Not necessarily original, but somehow, it's spectacular. While reading this book I felt like I'm in a roller coaster ride. There were lots of actions. And I mean, live, real, intense actions! JLA also did not fail to introduce me to her super swoony characters. And speaking of swoony characters, I'm talking about Roth and no other. Zayne? Nah. Never mind. I kind of don't like him. I don't know why JLA tried to make him the third party of a love triangle but seriously, I don't like it. I just want Roth and Layla. End of the story. \"I lost myself the moment I found you. White Hot Kiss is cheesy and darkly romantic. Roth and Layla's interactions are epically sweet and fantastic. I love their first encounter! It's something I simply can't forget. :) Apart from the romantic side, this book also has funny moments and I found myself really laughing at some point. Talk about the JLA humor... :D Anyways, I love this book. I just wished it wasn't that slow-paced at first, 'coz I admit it didn't get me instantly. I had to patiently read until the final chapters of the book to get my full attention. Because honestly, the best parts were at the final chapters. But all in all, it was a great and fun read.

Yes HEA: (view spoiler) [ Not yet (hide spoiler) ] White Hot Kiss is another YA paranormal romance by Jennifer L Armentrout and as every previous book by this author, this novel doesn\u2019t let go even for a single minute. It\u2019s one of those keeping you on the edge till the last page stories that will make you laugh, feel sad and angry as well as introduce you to amazing set of surprises, unexpected twists and turns and yes it does have a pretty perfect boy\u2026 or even two boys to swoon over. Layla is half demon and half Warden a creature similar to gargoyle. From the time she was seven she was raised by Wardens that for most part hate her and her demon\u2019s side. Why? Because demons are their natural enemies. The only Warden who cares about her is Zayne, Layla\u2019s secret crush. What\u2019s more Layla is dangerous; she craves human and wardens\u2019 souls. One kiss or being close enough to kiss and she won\u2019t be able to stop herself from sucking of someone\u2019s soul. When she reaches seventeen years old something weird start to happen to her. The demons are after her and there is mysterious Upper Level Demon that just saved her life and goes to her school\u2026 It was definitely not what I expected or hoped for. Armentrout went into completely different direction which was as much surprising as exciting. I can\u2019t say I was bored or didn\u2019t like how easily yet thrilling the story seemed to flow. Even when I thought things started to calm down I was quickly thrown into another bumpy ride. The characters as always were witty, funny and adorable. I loved all of them. Layla was strong and feisty but in completely different way than Alex from Covenant Series of Kathy from Lux Series. She was less impulsive or reckless, yet still she was kickass heroine with impressive backbone and pure heart. Roth stared at me, looking sort of stunned. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had it in you.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d He tapped the tip of my nose. \u201cYou\u2019re feisty underneath all that fluff.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I should be offended or not,\u201d The way she was treated by Wardens and humans made me feel bad for her. She was very lonely and unwanted. The only person that seemed to like and care for her was Zayne. After she met Roth things seemed to pick up for her and I was so glad she finally could be truly herself. I was a afraid of how the love triangle will look here \u2013 usually I hate them and reading about them makes me nauseous. Here, I didn\u2019t mind it much. In my eyes, Layla already made her choice and I hope it\u2019ll stay the same. Zayne was a good friend. Loyal, sweet and caring. I liked him, but he was not the one that made me all hot and bothered. It was the sexy demon called Roth that made me go all gaga. He was a little bit cocky, arrogant and bad in the best possible way. His comments made me laugh or smile.

His hair was dark, the color of obsidian, and it reflected blue in the dim light. Lazy locks slipped over his forehead and curled just below his ears. Brows arched over golden eyes and his cheekbones were broad and high. He was attractive. Very attractive. Mind-bendingly beautiful, actually, but the sardonic twist to his full lips chilled his beauty. The black T-shirt stretched across his chest and flat stomach. A huge tattoo of a snake curled around his forearm, the tail disappearing under his sleeve and the diamond-shaped head rested on the top of his hand. He looked my age. Total crush material\u2014if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he had no soul.\u201d Roth and Layla are just so entertaining. Their scenes together are definitely my favorites. I've noticed that JLA likes to use the same weird exclamation remarks in all her books...those, I actually found rather annoying...but other than that, I heart Roth lots and lots and lots, he's definitely still top 5 book boyfriend material. Zayne didn't really bug me the first time I read this, but after having read the 2nd one and deciding I was definitely not 'Team Zayne'....I decided I didn't really like his parts in this book the 2nd time around. The cliffhanger here, even though it isn't so much of a cliffhanger because I already know what happens...it still killed me...I am pretty sure I felt my heart break a little bit. I love books that can bring out such emotions, even on, especially on a reread. I am really, really, really excited for the release of Every Last Breath!!!!

I definitely liked it and was pleasantly surprised. I had been reading many reviews on it and wasn't sure if I would want another love triangle. Plot Summary Layla I-don't-know-her-last-name has just turned seventeen. She's like your average teenage girl. She tags demons, works with a group of demon hunters, so of course has to like a demon. So, no, she's not normal but she really wants to be. She is half-gargoyle/Warden and half-demon. This means that she has more abilities, including killer kisses, then the Wardens and also is why she can't mate or marry any of them. This is really bad for her since she has to stay apart from Zayne, her best friend and the Warden that she has liked since she was young. He is very kind and gorgeous and this the problem that much harder to endure. Of course there is going to be another guy. His name is Roth. He is also gorgeous but unlike Zayne, he is a demon. And has tattoos and piercings, which totally work on him. He can be egotistical but he is kind to Layla. Layla is inexplicably drawn to the man who claims to know everything about her and everything that is going on or will happen. She doesn't need to hide her true self, her demon side, from Roth which also means that they can kiss without fear of losing his soul. Which is a good thing for both of them since they kiss a couple of times a lot. Together they work together to figure out the cause of the recent demon activity and uprising that could possibly lead to the end of the world. In the process, Layla is torn between choosing between Roth and Zayne who is with the only family that she ever really had. What I liked The characters were pretty good for the most part. I liked Layla and the fact that she was trying to do her best and help everyone. I thought that she could have been seen saving herself more though. Roth was hysterical and I was smiling or laughing at everything he said. From the little I learned about Zayne, I liked him but not as much as Roth. Stacey I didn't like so much because had been with every guy it seemed which is a lot different from Layla. Sam was pretty cool with his smartness. The love triangle wasn't that pronounced. In the recent series that I've been reading, The Tiger Saga , there is the love triangle throughout the whole thing and it can sometimes get annoying. This never happened with this book. Instead the fact that Layla likes to guys is only brought up and talked about. Well, except for the end which brings up my next point. The ending was a massive cliffhanger and was a little upsetting. *mouth gaping and eyes blinking* It took me a few seconds and a few times going back to realize what had happened. I still didn't like the result but it makes the book that much more enjoyable and the desire for the next one greater! What I didn't like or could have been better I already mentioned some of the characters but I'll go over it again. Layla was sometimes shown as weak and would have to be saved or saved instead of her fighting. She would try it to fight it but it usually didn't work out. Layla also repeatedly said that she wasn't pretty or not good enough. I know that sometimes teenagers think like that but it seemed to be accented too much. These two things are also similar to The Tiger Saga . Stacey was also a problem for me. The way that she also talked about sex or made sexual innuendos was annoying and I thought kind of unnecessary. She would make comments about some jock at the school checking out Layla and then her saying that Layla was still a virgin and making fun about it. Roth and Zayne seemed almost too perfect. I know that they both had problems because of what they were but the whole time Layla seemed to be admiring their \"hard stomachs\" or \"holding their rock hard forearms.\" I think that it would have been much more realistic if they had more physical flaws. Even Roth's tattoos and piercings made Layla seem to like him more. It was kind of bizarre that the fact that there are demons wouldn't be known to people. I mean, they knew about Wardens and why else would they be there? Overall The book was written well. The plot was good even though to me it seemed to occasionally get confusing. There was a lot of jumping between fighting/learning action and romantic action. The characters were developed well or seemingly too fake or set up. There was a lot of action which was good and it definitely showed both sides of Layla and what they represented. I can't wait to read the next one. ...more 4.5 Stars On vacation- review to come! White Hot Kiss is the first in its series and a book I've started numerous times and out down. I decided this time I would triumph though and finish it. To my utter surprise I did. I kind of wish I hadn't, it wasn't the greatest book out (but I'll finish the series) and it had a series of issues I found. Most around the characters, both side and main, the dialogue, the love triangle, and the under developed world. Characters Layla was our sweet and innocent character. Almost every action of every White Hot Kiss is the first in its series and a book I've started numerous times and out down. I decided this time I would triumph though and finish it. To my utter surprise I did. I kind of wish I hadn't, it wasn't the greatest book out (but I'll finish the series) and it had a series of issues I found. Most around the characters, both side and main, the dialogue, the love triangle, and the under developed world. Characters Layla was our sweet and innocent character. Almost every action of every character was done to prove just how innocent and virginal she was, including her best friend. She's constantly blushing, flushing, turning red, whatever. Eventually she got better, but the fact that there was a lot of focus on her virginity grew tiresome. The fact she was unable to kiss anyone as well, apart from Roth, got boring as well. She was a bit of a kickass character in the end, but still. Zayne was the \"nice guy\". But I hated him. I just didn't like his attitude and his superior attitude for what he was. He made promises, but then proceeded not to uphold them. Zayne was a character I wouldn't classify as nice, he is a character I would like to stab 28 times in the chest actually. He was all around crappy and I won't waste my type taking about the arrogant prick. Roth was the \"bad boy\". I wouldn't go that far though since he was the only decent character. The only definition that would place him under the definition of a bad boy was that he was demon that was also the Crown Prince of hell. Honestly, he was the only one who told Layla the truth and wasn't constantly lying. If she doesn't end up with him I'll be pissed and punch someone. Plot Was subpar, it wasn't anything I hadn't read before. It followed the classic storyline of a JLA book and did get a bit cliche in some parts. Apart from that, I did enjoy the book despite the fact I felt a tad bit of a Sweet Evil trilogy vibe. Writing It was classic JLA writing. I loved it and I hated it. The dialogue in some parts was cringe worthy and I couldn't see a 17 year old saying it. However, it flowed and I love just love JLA either way. Overall I would give this book a 3.5 overall. It was good. Kept me interested, but wasn't anything I hadn't seen before. ...more Can I have it now, pleeease?! More Books from Jennifer?? More Sexy Boys But then... ...we have to wait till 2014 White Hot Kiss is book one in The Dark Elements series by Jennifer L. Armentrout. First I want to say that I have not read very many gargoyle books so I didn\u2019t know what to expect going into this. But lets be realistic here. This book was written by Jennifer Armentrout. So I knew it was going to be epic. And I was NOT disappointed. In this world we have wardens that are gargoyles that look like humans except while they sleep or when they choose to shed their human skin as in during a fight. The w White Hot Kiss is book one in The Dark Elements series by Jennifer L. Armentrout. First I want to say that I have not read very many gargoyle books so I didn\u2019t know what to expect going into this. But lets be realistic here. This book was written by Jennifer Armentrout. So I knew it was going to be epic. And I was NOT disappointed. In this world we have wardens that are gargoyles that look like humans except while they sleep or when they choose to shed their human skin as in during a fight. The world knows about them, they have gone public. Then there are the demons. This is the reason for the wardens. But, the world does not know about the demons. They walk among us every day disguised as humans so we don\u2019t see them, but the wardens do. The wardens patrol the earth every night to rid the world of the demons, to protect the humans. Then we have our main character, Layla. She is seventeen years old and is half warden and half demon. She was adopted into a family of wardens about 10 years ago, raised as a warden. But cannot shift like a warden can. Demons have the ability to suck the soul out of a human or a warden and Layla has this ability. So as a result, she can never kiss a boy, she can never kiss the handsome Zayne who she was raised with. Who she has had a crush on since the day she was brought into the house. Zayne is 21 years old. His father, Abbott wants him to choose a female, have children, but Zayne says he\u2019s not ready. It obvious he feels more for Layla than he wants to. But even though its never spoken, its obvious he knows it can never be. Then, there is Roth. There has to be a sexy bad boy right?! Roth is a demon. He keeps turning up when Layla needs saving. And that seems to be happening more and more often. And the more we get to know him, the more we fall for him, as does Layla. And demons don\u2019t have souls, so the whole kissing problem, well, its not a problem with Roth. What I didn\u2019t expect, though, with this book, is to feel so emotionally involved. Layla is not accepted by most of the Warden world. She is half demon and Wardens hate demons. So where does she belong? I felt so bad for her struggling with this. And as she and Roth spend time together it was obvious that feelings were developing. So why is Roth protecting her? Why do these demons keep trying to kill her? Can she really trust Roth? I was hooked from the first page to the last page and was left with my heart pounding. Layla has so much ahead of her and I can\u2019t wait to find out what it is. I will leave you with my favorite line of the entire book. Who says it to whom? You will have to read it to find out. \u201cI lost myself the moment I found you.\u201d ...more 6 out of 10 \u0420\u0435\u0432\u044c\u044e \u0432 \u043c\u043e\u0435\u043c \u0431\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0435/This review on my blog Living A Thousand Lives (please use Chrome/Yandex browser or Android/IOS to see the page; otherwise, spoiler-tags I use to make my post compact may not work) Short-Soundtrack: AFI\u2013 Kiss and control Starset\u2013 My Demons Royksopp\u2013 Here She Comes Again Genre : urban-fantasy, YA Stuff : gargoyles, demons, hybrids Fail : typical Armentrout WOW : Astaroth POV : 1st-person, female Love-Geometry : medium Quote-Core : \u201cPeople with the purest souls are capable of the g 6 out of 10 \u0420\u0435\u0432\u044c\u044e \u0432 \u043c\u043e\u0435\u043c \u0431\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0435/This review on my blog Living A Thousand Lives (please use Chrome/Yandex browser or Android/IOS to see the page; otherwise, spoiler-tags I use to make my post compact may not work) Short-Soundtrack: AFI\u2013 Kiss and control Starset\u2013 My Demons Royksopp\u2013 Here She Comes Again Genre : urban-fantasy, YA Stuff : gargoyles, demons, hybrids Fail : typical Armentrout WOW : Astaroth POV : 1st-person, female Love-Geometry : medium Quote-Core : \u201cPeople with the purest souls are capable of the greatest evils.\u201d I\u2019m late for the party. Seems like all the people have already read this book while I was looking in the other direction and even forgot who\u2019s the author of gargoyle\u2019s (wtf) romance. But a couple of chapters and I\u2019ve got it \u2013 Jennifer Armentrout. Here we are, with Deamon renamed as Roth, Katy-hybrid with name Layla, school-blah, and a clan of creatures with a problem with breeding\u2026 The concept is not bad. Stone guards showed themselves to people, their goal is to secure the earth from evil and humans from the knowledge about demons. Excuse me? People aware of gargoyles living among them, know they protect them from something, but they have no idea from what exactly? What do they think the guards fight? Financial crisis? High taxes? Kid alcoholism? The plot is quite simple. A girl thinks she's that but it turns out that's she's this , and then everyone get that she's something more . The world is in danger, of course. But it\u2019s not the matter. The matter is, Layla has two boys, both are sexy and handsome, but one of them she can\u2019t kiss or else she\u2019ll take his soul, the other one is perfectly kissable, but he\u2019s a demon. What a choice! As to me, I see no problem at all. Why? I\u2019m going to explain\u2026. Zayne. A guard with long hair with color of sand (I don\u2019t know how long it is, but he can scrape it back into a ponytail, I didn't forgive such a thing even to Belikov, so I won't make exceptions for someone named Zayne). Huge and strong boy, who likes to call Layla a bug (how nice of him) and daydream (secretly) about her. They can\u2019t be together \u2013 Zayne wants to come to heaven after his death where live A\u2026 no, not angels \u2013 Alphas! But it\u2019s not the only reason \u2013 Layla is a half-demon-half-guard (I can\u2019t not to share with you my association: in Russian Stand Up Show a guy was performing with a keyboard and was talking about sounds, he pressed a button named \u201csluice\u201d and then a button named \u201chorse\u201d and then he made with them a very funny song named half-horse-half-sluice\u2026 you see the pattern, yes?), well, she can\u2019t be his mate, no guard can breed with a half-horse\u2026 I mean, half-demon-half-guard. And as you see, I\u2019m not a fan of Zayne. He countless times gave up to his father Layla\u2019s secrets, discussed her weaknesses with Layla\u2019s girl-enemy who is a very good mate for Zayne, so Zayne\u2019s father is trying to bring them closer, and overall he acted like an idiot. Roth. Tall brunet with an amazing body and a snarky sense of humor. Demon. Crown Prince of Hell. *pause for laughing* I adore him. He\u2019s awesome. He\u2019s the one sane person in this story. Staying himself till the end he was growing up and becoming a \u201creal boy\u201d (Hello, Pinocchio!). His skin is decorated with a few tattoos (they are alive!), his tongue has piercing, his eyes are gold, he\u2019s a good singer, drives Porsche and reads Po. Moreover, he\u2019s stalking MC, saving her ass, telling her the truth about her heritage and feeds her with cookies. Em\u2026 what\u2019s wrong with you, Layla? With Zayne you ate only sweet dough and drank orange juice. Roth is the best! Layla. Typical Katy with all the consequences those come with it. If you haven\u2019t met Katy yet, I\u2019ll tell you what to expect. MC is naive flower which has a few friends and thinks that she\u2019s not pretty while she\u2019s definitely hot as\u2026 as an albino with nice curves. A great potential is contained inside of her and she will show the world her true nature, but first you have to make her angry while beating her love interests, both of them (!) or else magic won\u2019t work. The defect : We gonna die! What can we do?! Kiss! Jennifer loves such twists. I don\u2019t mind them too. But maybe we should go somewhere safe and only then would taking our clothes off? Mythology is a grab bag. The process : tones of misunderstandings plus final action-reunion. The ending. Too fulfilled. You can mistake this book for a standalone if not to know better. A few unspoken things wouldn\u2019t hurt. Overall. The writing style is kinda aphrodisiac (Roth knows how to use his mouth (in Russian \u201cRoth\u201d means \u201cMouth\u201d, so you see what I\u2019m doing here) and not only mouth). MC isn\u2019t bad, not super smart but not annoying either. Love triangle isn\u2019t that obvious in view of the fact that one of the cathetuses aren\u2019t fit our hypotenuse (I heard this reason would somehow resolved in the sequel). It was a very fast and funny read (just think about a snake Bambi, a kitten Thor or a dragon Tumper, all of these cuties belong to Roth as well as my heart). I will continue this series.

Layla hates his guts, but she can't handle him. (I don't blame her since he's HOT!) That's not the only problem for Layla since being with Roth is like stabbing her family and Zayne in the back. \u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8 \u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8 \u201cYou need something,\" he said, and when I stared at him, he added, \"Your face.\" \"My face?\" \"It's in need of my kisses.\u201d \u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8 Characters: Layla: Layla is a half demon, half Warren. She has no idea who are her parents, and so she lives with the Warrens. Layla's life is 'perfect' because she goes to school, and lives her life almost regularly. However, when she meets Roth, he makes her realize that she was fooled all along. The love she had for Zayne decreases as Roth makes her experience so many new things she could have never done before. What made me like Layla is the fact that she didn't histate to hide some secrets from her 'family'. Even though she knew they were hiding so many facts from her, she just never felt sorry. She grows stronger throughout the book which is also great. Roth: Roth is just amazing. I like his personality. His comebacks. I like how he treats Layla, and how sweet he is. I also like Bambi, and the fact that it always help Layla. Roth is perfect in every way, and I have to admit I'm so team Roth! Give me a YA book that I didn't choose a team? \u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8 Positives: 1) Roth! This comes as no surprise since Roth became one of my book boyfriends from the start of the book. He's just great with amazing comebacks. I love the way he teases Layla, and I honestly feel like layla doesn't deserve him. I love how he's a demon and still kind and caring. 2) Layla: Okay, so I don't like many heroines, but Layla is kinda awesome. She's not weak, and has her own thinking. Although she made me pissed at some parts *cough* *cough* (Roth is wrapped around her finger!) *cough* 3) Plot: I really like the plot because so many plot twists happened. I love the fact that Roth and Layla started off as enemies, and ended up pretty close (Pretty cliche but who cares?) 4) The character development. When I started reading this book, Layla was protected by everyone around her. She wasn't cared much for, and is always on the side. By the end of the book, she's a strong character who knows how to protect herslef. She can see whose on her side, and whose not. \u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8 \u201cAt some point, Roth had gotten hold of my cell and replaced Zayne's name with Stony and listed his own number under Sexy Beast. What a tool\u201d -\u2764 \u201cThen I guess I'll just have to try biting again\" \"You wanna try?\" He leaned the curve of my cheek. \"Let me suggest more appropriate places. I have this piercing.\u201d \u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8 Negative: 1) Zayne: In this book, I don't think there are two teams. There is only TeamRoth because Zayne doesn't even have a chance! He was completely engrossed with his own stupid ideas when so many things were happening around him. He is so ignorant, and always pity himself, and I just Dislike him!!! 2) All the Warren community! Ugh!! I mean they act like they're perfect, and pure, while they suck, and needs to learn respect. I just think that Layla is a bit stupid because she stick with them. SMH!! \u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8 Favorite part: when Roth saves Layla for the hundredth time, and take her to his apartment!! God!! That was the best sleepover I read in a book. \u263b Ending: The ending was OMG!!! I wanted more from Roth, but it's fine. There are two more books in the series so I will forgive Jennifer for the ending this time. \u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8 \u201cIf i say thank you, will you go away?\" \"Yes\" \"Thank you\" I said eagerly. \"I lied\" \"What?\" I looked up at him, frowning. \"That's messed up\u201d \u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8\u25a8 I rated this five stars because it was a very good book. I would defintely complete reading the series, but I'm still waiting for the third book to come out. I seriously can't wait. So, this book is also added to many favroite books list. It was an entertaining, action packed book. Heroine: 4 stars. Hero: 5 stars (DUHHHH!!) Romance level: 5 stars. Ending: 4 stars. Plot: 5 stars. Writing style: 5 stars (I love Jennifer Almentrout's writing.) Recommendation: I recommend this to every Fantasy/Romance readers out there. This has a very unique storyline, and will definitely an interesting read. ...more Another Jennifer L. Armentrout book? Yes! I mean. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT! I almost fell out of my chair, seeing this. I love Jenn. She is my favorite author of all time and will always be my favorite author. The title though... seems awesome. ANd to express it's awesomeness, i'm going to put a lot of Gerard Butler GIFs because he equals the awesomeness of Jennifer and he is pretty awesome. Go Jennifer. Go Jennifer. Go Jennifer. Jennifer L. Armentrout nunca me decepciona. Puede que esta historia no haya sido mi favorita de la autora, pero lo mismo me pas\u00f3 con Obsidian y al final la saga Lux se ha convertido en mi segunda saga favorita. S\u00e9 que con el potencial de Jennifer, va a darnos una segunda parte incre\u00edble. Lo que me gusta de este tipo de historia es que nos mete una trama de romance que nos encanta (que por cierto, me ha gustado much\u00edsimo como lo ha llevado en esta novela), pero que no es en lo \u00fanico que se centra Jennifer L.

I cannot wait for this one :-D Why does every book have to have a love triangle!!! :-( the trust of a boy she\u2019s loved forever ^^^Team this guy! I COULD READ THIS A THOUSAND TIMES AND STILL LOVE IT! This was my first book by Jennifer L. Armentrout and I think it will forever be a favourite of mine. Don\u2019t get me wrong every book or series she releases I become obsessed with to the point were they get 5 stars because I haven\u2019t moved off my ass for hours because I can\u2019t bear to part from the book and compare every other book boyfriend on the planet to her gorgeous characters\u2026 This isn\u2019t sad at all! So when it came to reading White Hot Kiss ag I COULD READ THIS A THOUSAND TIMES AND STILL LOVE IT! This was my first book by Jennifer L. Armentrout and I think it will forever be a favourite of mine. Don\u2019t get me wrong every book or series she releases I become obsessed with to the point were they get 5 stars because I haven\u2019t moved off my ass for hours because I can\u2019t bear to part from the book and compare every other book boyfriend on the planet to her gorgeous characters\u2026 This isn\u2019t sad at all! So when it came to reading White Hot Kiss again, I was absolutely thrilled to find it was like reading the book a fresh with all the plot twists, drama, tension, angst and FEELS! JLA manages to make people made of stone sexy and demons with some interesting piercings and tattoo\u2019s the hottest people on the planet. When she decides to write a male love interest she does not hold back. Naturally we have two warring enemies The Wardens (gargoyles) and The Demons. Layla is a hybrid of the two; because of this she can see people\u2019s souls and leave a \u2018mark\u2019 on a Demon that only The Warden\u2019s can see and use to hunt them. Warden Zayne is Layla's best friend and childhood crush but he still treats her as an annoying friend/sister, nothing can ever happen between them; Layla can\u2019t kiss anyone with a soul and Zayne has the purest soul, to do so would kill him. Perfect! Enter Roth, the baddest thing in town; Roth, a demon who also happens to be the most alluring, sexy, arrogant person ever\u2026 and that whole nothing kissing people with a soul? Not a problem here, demons don\u2019t have souls. Layla is helpless to Roth\u2019s antic\u2019s, she knows he\u2019s bad news, if the Wardens found her even speaking to a demon she would be branded a traitor but what can she do when he turns up at her school, the park and even the bathroom? There's only so much resisting a girl can do! \u201cAt some point, Roth had gotten hold of my cell and replaced Zayne's name with Stony and listed his own number under Sexy Beast. What a tool. I grinned.\u201d I\u2019m sure it\u2019s obvious that this book will feature a love triangle but trust me you will not mind it but if you really do oppose them I would still give this book a try as it\u2019s much more focused on one side of the triangle and not a pissing contest at every turn. The romance is sizzling as JLA always pushes the boundaries on YA, which I love! It does get a little cheesy at times and maybe you want more action but it really doesn't take anything away from the story and truly these thoughts only enter your mind after you've read the book and reflect on it. \"I think you like me,\" Roth said suddenly. I stopped pacing and my heart did a funny little jump. \"What? No.\" He tilted his head to the side, his lips spreading into a teasing grin. \"The way you lie to yourself is sort of cute.\" \"I'm not lying.\" \"Hmm...\" He sat up, eyes glimmering with mirth. \"You wanted me to kiss you earlier.\u201d Heat flooded my cheeks. \"No. I did not.\" \"You're right. You wanted me to do much, much more.\" This was such a fun read, even the secondary characters were amazing, this book is filled with sexual tension, forbidden romance, childhood-crushes and a lot of humour that will have you laughing along the way. The cliffhanger for me was heartbreaking, it was no less traumatic reading it the second time around.. some series sacrifices are made! \u201cI lost myself the moment I found you.\u201d Literary-ly Obsessed ...more Buy this book on AMAZON or buy this book on BookDepository with FREE WORLDWIDE SHIPPING 4 of 5 stars (Please read my rating system further below).

I'm not sure what I expected from this novel with a blurb that screamed love-triangle, involving a paranormal creature I have not had the best of luck with in the past. Fortunately, I found myself enjoying this one quite a bit. As expected - knowing this author's style - romance has a large presence in this story, and it does not lack any chemistry. Again, Armentrout has created characters who make your heart beat faster just by being on the same page together. Yes, there is a love triangle, but surprisingly, I did not hate it. Likely due to the fact that a relationship with Zayne is physically impossible - considering Layla's unique but uncontrollably deadly soul-stealing ability. In turn, the focus of the romance is kept between Layla and Roth. Layla: \"Obviously an Upper Level demon like you?\" Roth: \"But definitely not as awesome as me.\" Oh, have you met Roth? The sometimes infuriating, usually hilarious, often cocky, hot tattooed demon who breaks all the molds Layla has mentally built around his kind. His\u2026 unique personality aside, I found his character very interesting in regards to his history and purpose. As the story progresses, we also get glimpses at the good in him, proving that not all demons are textbook evil. Plus the humor he brings in balances out the darkness that surrounds this plot. Even though the romance is hot and the chemistry, intense, what I enjoyed the most was the impending-apocalypse storyline. We've got demons on earth who are starting to appear with increasing frequency, their freaking abilities ranging from simply causing mayhem, to creating zombies and possessing humans. We've also got gargoyles who are burdened with holding these demons in check. And then there's Layla, a mix of both who doesn't truly fit in with either side. But she is learning who she really is, what was hidden from her, and we begin to see just how epic this plot is about to become. The balance of good and evil is, naturally, a significant part of this story. I have had bad luck with these kinds of good vs evil plots in the past but I was fascinated by much of this one - helped, I'm sure, by the absence of angels. White Hot Kiss begins with an awareness of the standing tension between Layla and the gargoyles, followed by the existence of an ominous secret, and our interest is kept by the ever increasing intensity that is, literally, impending doom. Filled with action, humor, blazing hot romance, and a tragic ending, Armentrout's latest will not let you down! \"I was raised in Hell. You could say I'm socially awkward\" -- An advance copy was provided by the publisher for review. For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads ...more What just happened?!

Oh for sake of the demons someone shake me!! Another amazing read from Armentrout that I could not put down, seriously I read it in one sitting unable to even eat my dinner properly because I couldn\u2019t put it down. Now I\u2019m sitting at 12:30 am writing a review after bawling my eyes out as I could not believe what I was reading. I knew I was going to love this because I adored Bitter Sweet Love, I actually love anything Jennifer Armentrout writes, to be honest. I love the way she makes these swoon-worthy characters (and I\u2019m not just talking about the males) that you build up in your mind as she goes into so much detail about them then how the story goes where you just don\u2019t think it will, she is amazing! The story follows a girl named Layla our little half demon/warden (gargoyle) who can steal a soul with a simple kiss. She lives with a bunch of gargoyles (including Zayne the hot 21-year-old that she has been attached to since she got to their home) who at night hunt down demons to keep the balance between good and evil. Layla can see people\u2019s auras showing her who is the good, bad and downright evil except demons\u2026 they don\u2019t have an aura. After school Layla \u201ctags\u201d demons by slightly touching them which lights them up like the Eiffel Tower so our gargoyle friends can take them out at night. Layla reminds me of Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones, with her platinum blonde hair and perfect features, she never feels like she really belongs because she is an abomination by both races. Yet she is so strong which I totally admire of both women! All she wants is to be a warden yet only Zayne really treats her like she belongs with them. Then she meets Roth, the beautiful upper-level demon that\u2019s thrown into the mix who wants her to see that everything isn\u2019t as black and white that the wardens make out\u2026 and who she can kiss! *squeals* Then her world is turned upside down as nothing makes sense anymore. Zayne frustrated me at times, do you want her? Or would you like Danika? You are flirty one minute and then acting like a brother the next, no wonder she was turning into a crazy cat, teenage hormones are wild!! Roth, on the other hand, was so cocky and confident he had me blushing and giggling all through the story. The end of the book is so emotional so be prepared! My heart was aching and in true Armentrout style, I didn\u2019t expect what was happening. The book is worth 5 stars as I have already started on Stone Cold Touch\u2026 AMAZING!
