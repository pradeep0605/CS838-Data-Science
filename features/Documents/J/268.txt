There was not one false note in this entire book. People acted in this book how they actually do in real life (at least in my experience). Their feelings of love and anger and self-hate were so acute, I often found myself relating to each character more than once. Maybe some of this comes from where I am emotionally right now\u2014somewhere teetering between hope and devastation. I am struggling with these two emotions every day,<---M> every minute</---M>, as are more than one of the characters in this book. Characters who have had their dreams dashed or have never let themselves think they're worthy of having dreams. [I related so much to their feelings, I think I wept during the last 60 pages or so, sentimental cuss that I am.:] Love, too, finds a prominent place here. The love between a sister and a brother and a father and a son, both relationships I am quite familiar with. The disappointments, the pride, the desire to help, the desire to flee and hide. The book is written from the viewpoint of Glory, a woman in her late 30s who has returned to her childhood home after a collapsed engagement to care for her elderly father.<---F> She is hardworking, caring, but bitter</---F>. She feels as though she cannot escape her lot in life, and envies her siblings who all went off and started their own families. Except for her brother Jack, who disappeared 20 years ago and has suddenly returned home. Jack is aloof, sad, self-deprecating, lost, and confused. He was always the black sheep of the family\u2014the preacher's son who became thief and miscreant. He is constantly haunted by his past actions and his sense of self-worthlessness. Every day is a struggle for him emotionally, and he is blind to see that others may truly love him, regardless of his behavior. It is this Jack who returns home suddenly to spend time with Glory and their father. Boughton, the father, is a former Presbyterian minister. He vacillates between the blind love of a father to his son and an undeniable fury of the disappointment his son has been. Jack has not only wrestled with moral behavior, but also has become an agnostic (maybe even atheist), wanting to believe in something, but unable to cross that line. This devastates Boughton perhaps more than anything else. And so, the book follows the weeks in which Jack has appeared and asked to stay with his father and sister, both of whom grow to have changing feelings about Jack's return, switching roles from resentment to familial love. There were so many themes here that I relished seeing play out between these characters [who are, incidentally, all supporting characters from Robinson's other fantastic book, Gilead :]: love, resentment, redemption, guilt, one's certainty or uncertainty of faith, depression, self-hatred, care, loss, loneliness, hope, and\u2014of course\u2014familial relationships. Robinson has a clean, clear sense of prose that allows characters to bloom into themselves, revealing deep connections with themselves, their feelings, and the world. Great book. ...more This book is simply beautiful and heartbreaking.

She thought and hoped he might not remember her at all.\" I wish I could encourage everyone to read this book; I wish I had the ability to write about how profound and wondrous and sad this book is. Most people won\u2019t read this book, because they just don\u2019t read. Some will dislike this story\u2019s religious overtones. They\u2019ll also notice it\u2019s a small domestic tale set in southwestern Iowa. And then they\u2019ll say there are no car crashes, eviscerations, pirates, alien monsters, superpowers, and murders; no raping, pillaging and plundering to keep them turning pages. <+++>Home</+++> is simply a story about family, about feeling a foreigner in your own house, about forgiveness and gentleness and grace. It\u2019s the third book by an author who won the Pulitzer a few years ago for the small book Gilead . Gilead \u2013 set in the mid 1950s - was about <---C>John Ames</---C>, a dying minister, an old groom writing letters as an inheritance to his unexpected, young son. In these letters, Reverend Ames tells his young son about three generations of Ames ministers. There was the violently abolitionist grandfather (who fought and lost and eye in the Kansas Wars), his pacifist father (who refused to serve in WWI), and then his own place in this progeny. Gilead is the name of their small fictional town. It was a book that required patience but rewarded with poetry, sensibility, and mercy. <+++>Home</+++> is the other side of that same story. Ames\u2019 best friend since they were eight was a Presbyterian minister Robert Boughton. Boughton had eight kids, one who he named after Ames. This son, Jack (as he asks to be called) is the black sheep of the Boughton clan, but he is also the most loved. He was a petty thief, a vandal, and a loner. When he was in college, he came home and got a sixteen-year-old pregnant and then abandoned her and his own family, running away not to be heard from for twenty years. When Jack does return - rough, bone-thin, and hung over \u2013 he finds his dad is dying. The old minister is being watched after by the youngest daughter, Glory, who is trying to hide that her eight-year engagement has ended in abandonment. (The book is told with special attention to Glory\u2019s perspective.) Together, Glory and Reverend Boughton try to make Jack feel at home in the home he always felt alien in. They try to practice Christian grace, and they try to help this prodigal son plagued by his own ghosts, his unmet hopes, criminal behavior, alcoholism, depression, and his self-loathing. That\u2019s about all I could tell you. The rest, if you have the patience (there are no chapters, just small divided sections, for all 314 pages), is filled with small-town events and heart-breaking revelations. I will admit, I am from southern Iowa, in the same area of Robinson\u2019s fictional town of Gilead. Like Jack, I am also from a large family, and I am the black sheep, the one who never felt at home in his parents\u2019 house. I understand Jack\u2019s want to belong, and yet an entire lifetime of family history has informed him that he is different from his many brothers and sisters; I understand when he states that he wished he could just walk through the door and be as comfortable as his siblings did, doing homework at the table, belonging. I also know the quiet and merciful religiosity of Home , the grace that tries to reach Jack and help him not knowing that its beauty and generosity only makes him feel less deserving and more foreign. I cried a lot while reading Home . I still am, trying to tell you about it. ...more I love this book. I had a good, long weep after finishing it. But that's not why I love it.

Her other books are also wonderful, but this one makes me sure that <---A>Marilynne Robinson</---A> is one of the greatest writers alive today. That it is original is an understatement. I could talk about how I think she's establishing a new literary genre, but the truth is, I love this book. I had a good, long weep after finishing it. But that's not why I love it.

Her other books are also wonderful, but this one makes me sure that Marilynne Robinson is one of the greatest writers alive today. That it is original is an understatement. I could talk about how I think she's establishing a new literary genre, but the truth is, I don't really know enough to talk like that \u2014 even if I heartily suspect that my great-grandchildren will be studying her in their literature classes. I only know the effect her work has on me. It's breathtaking, heartbreaking and alarming like nothing I've ever read before; and at the same time piercingly subtle, humble, gentle and wonderful. It horrifies me before I even know I'm being horrified, when I think I'm safe. Like watching dust motes float in the sunshine streaming in through a quiet window and suddenly understanding what it means to be human. I can see how some people would read this book (or her other two) and be bored, or just not get it. Her words command a sort of attention that's not common these days, and that takes some energy; and on the surface, the plot progresses slowly and seems quite benign. But the wonder of these stories! The gut-wrenching power of them. Each story is bigger than the sum of its parts. Her work is entirely and gloriously subversive, in the best sense. In Home , she takes what seems to be a bucolic tale of a small town, drenched in subtle family dynamics and old-time religion, and turns it into a tale of hopeless human depravity and extraordinary, confounding redemption. But it's not gothic. There are no apocalyptic visions, no supernatural interventions, no blood and violence. It's not epic or modernist, either \u2014 and despite all of the religious overtones (and undertones), it's not a morality tale, not at all. Her characters are unassuming. The settings are modest. There aren't any freaks, despots, heroes or villains. How does she pull it off? She doesn't rely on any of the tricks or shocking contrasts that other writers use to make the reader feel the horror and weight of the problem at hand. It looks like pottery, but feels like gold; heavy, spare, significant, rich. Home is not just a companion piece to Gilead ; it surpasses Gilead . Gilead was a preparation, a working-up-to-this-one. Interesting, now, to think about Gilead in light of Home \u2014 perhaps it is not as innocuous as I originally thought. I may have to re-read it. With each novel, Robinson's work progresses and opens further and deeper and sends out creeper vines into as-yet unexplored literary territory. Like the best sort of art. ...more I hate to say this as it sounds so trite and I\u2019m certainly not religious but this is indeed one of those novels that has been touched by the hand of grace.

Marilynne Robinson in her unique inimitable way has produced a sublime work that exquisitely captures the life of Reverend Boughton and his children Glory and Jack. This novel encapsulates the ideals of family life and solidarity regardless of what becomes of them and what is so touching is that Jack, the wayward son, who did everything out of sync, be it theft, drunkenness, etc. still retained the love of his father and even greater than Jack\u2019s other siblings. The book actually quite overwhelmed me in this sense of forgiveness and yet of love in Reverend Boughton\u2019s waiting and waiting for his wayward son, his doubts and misgivings and finally when Jack returns, well it was worth it. As Reverend Boughton\u2019s life draws to a close, his long suffering daughter Glory is close by his side, easing him through this troubled time but his lifeline is Jack, his mercurial child but still so loved. This is not a fast moving book but one to be deliciously savoured as a good Medoc. Hidden aspects are constantly uncovered and the lyrical writing of Robinson, especially her descriptions, adds such beauty that will not be seen again for a long time. There\u2019s such a spirit of place about this book. Glory, who had loved her brother as a child, now finds him difficult but slowly they develop a mutual love and it is rather splendid to see. I consider Jack comparable to the elusive kingfisher with its fleeting appearance above the river bank, the flash of electric blue that brings that magical aspect, be it somewhat ephemeral to a human somehow but it nevertheless manages to project the soul of Jack, despite his misdemeanors into a powerful personality not to be reckoned with. It\u2019s also interesting to see how Jack\u2019s relationship with Reverend Boughton\u2019s closest friend, the Reverend John Ames develops. Plus the latter\u2019s rather unique wife Laila, a former itinerant and now fully ensconced into the church and yet, despite her happy contented life, she remains unsettled. She views her much loved elderly husband and knows that she will see his burial and then, perhaps the bird of paradise will escape from her gilded cage that has so suited her for the moment. She doesn\u2019t know. It is delightful to see John Ames face as he observes his wife. It is as though he will never know what she will project and he continues to be entranced by her...Touching. A remarkable and sobering book. Much loved by me and to be reread many times. ...more 5+ stars. The hope that I will find a book like this one is the reason I read. Home.

Thomas Wolfe told us \u201cyou can never go home again\u201d, Marilynne Robinson seems to say you can never leave home at all. As complicated as the concept of Home is, forgiveness might be even more complicated. God dispenses grace and calls for man to forgive, but can man truly forgive? The two venerable pastors in this novel, Robert Boughton and John Ames, certainly talk about forgiveness as though it is something they understand and aspire to, but neither of them seems capable of true forgiveness. Robert can never look beyond the past to see the man Jack truly is, and, because Jack is his namesake, Ames counts every trespass as an affront to his good name. Neither of them is able to embrace the change in Jack. They look at the man, but they always and forever see the boy. Glory, who has always struggled to understand who her elusive brother Jack was , is the one person who is able to look at who he is without flinching. She offers hope in what feels like a pretty hopeless situation. If there is a home to come to for Jack, Glory embodies it. We wonder why the past cannot be purged, when the present and the future are so tenuous. Why is Jack back, after all these years, to endure this endless flogging? Like Robert Frost\u2019s hired man, Jack knows \u2018Home is the place where, when you have to go there, They have to take you in.\u2019 But, he is hoping the truth will lie in \u2018I should have called it Something you somehow haven\u2019t to deserve.\u2019 Robinson says, \"Weary or bitter or bewildered as we may be, God is faithful. He lets us wander so we will know what it means to come home.\" But that implies a sweetness in the homecoming that eludes these characters no matter how they try to have it otherwise. If you come from a perfect family in which the members have always understood and loved one another, you might not register the impact of this story. If you come from a family who have loved one another, but always found understanding one another difficult, it might be like looking in a mirror. If you have ever felt outside in places that you know should have been your comfort zone, Jack will resonate with you, and if you have ever had a sibling that you loved but felt estranged from, Jack will make you cry. I loved Robinson\u2019s Gilead. I built my own backstory for Jack Boughton and thought I had a fair idea of who Glory and Robert were. I was anxious to know more about those characters, but what I got in Home was so much more than I could ever have imagined. Seeing Ames side of the story, and then Jack\u2019s, was so revealing about the character of human beings, how often we view life only in the context of what it means to us, for us, when the motivation of the other person can be so different and not about \u201cus\u201d at all. I am on to Lila and the final leg of this journey. I highly recommend this series to everyone who wants to grapple for a little while with the larger questions in life. Not good vs. evil, but man\u2019s incapacity to sort good from evil, to understand the depths of the human heart, to touch another man\u2019s soul. Glory asks Jack what he thinks the soul is, perhaps that is the question for all of us and to know the answer to our own soul we must try to understand someone else\u2019s. As for home, I leave you with this thought from Marilynne Robinson: \"Home. What kinder place could there be on earth, and why did it seem to them all like exile? Oh, to be passing anonymously, through an impersonal landscape! Oh not to know every stump and stone, not to remember how the fields of Queen Anne\u2019s lace figured in the childish happiness they had offered to their father\u2019s hopes.\" Oh to carry no past, to have no hurts, no scars, no disappointments, no calamitous youth to haunt your present. Oh to be perfect and not need forgiveness, or perhaps to only be perfect enough to be able to forgive. ...more Maybe I'm missing something, or I'm too young, or maybe nothing can live up to the expectations I had for this after Housekeeping and Gilead, or maybe I read it too fast, but I seriously found this book incredibly boring.

But mostly reading this book felt like watching a play in which all the characters repress their stupid feelings all the time and never say what they mean and have really boring conversations for three acts and then go on being sad. And, yeah, Gilead's a boring book, too, but it's so beautiful and revelatory that it doesn't matter that basically nothing happens. But when you're writing in scene and dialogue, it's a lot harder to keep me interested in nothing happening, and Home sure didn't. Mostly it just made me feel like a big jerk for not liking it. ...more Home (Gilead, #2), Marilynne Robinson \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u00ab\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0647\u00bb

I always felt as though I was reading it in the morning, just at that exact moment when the majestic rays of the rising sun feel most wonderful. Not too hot, not too bright, just right. It was radiant, I felt like it gave a stir to my bones, an energy of some sort, a source of strength. It's funny really, because the book treads on a slow, probably careful albeit graceful pace. It would probably have been a five-star, had it not spent much time serving the appetizer before getting to the main course. Mind you, though, this appetizer is really most delectable. It's one of those stories that graph a flat line till the much awaited climax. What's interesting to note is that Madame Robinson writes with a rich and resonant tone that nullifies the evenness and stagnancy of the tale. I was conscious of the slow progress, yet I never once felt bored. This novel is a meditation on human capacity. It questions the limits of our ability to forgive. It delves into the cracks of our self-control. It wallows in the nature of empathy and the reasons behind it. It measures the distance that unrequited love will walk. It examines regret and why we do things that lead to it. And it presents us with the reality that self-destruction isn't limited to the destruction of one's self. That the shrapnel of destruction reaches those people that care for you, that love you, that you destroy them as well. Religion plays an important part in this story. The tale actually revolves around the estranged family of a reverend. So as can be expected, theology is used as medium when looking through the problems aforementioned. To my unbelieving comrades, no worries, an unbelieving son equalizes the playing field. He is often playfully sarcastic to the point of heresy. Doctrines are questioned and scriptures are misused, but he means well. It was one of the most important moments for me when the unbelieving son says he doesn't quite believe, but he understands. \u201cIt is possible to know the great truths without feeling the truth of them.\u201d We all have differences of opinion, it should not be our aim to convert others to our view but rather to make them understand. Coming from a very religious family, I am quite different in my views with them. I still believe in God, but I am not one with certain things they believe in, especially those that appear rather dogmatic, but I understand why they believe such things and I respect it. Enough about me. Now, there are especially interesting discussions about the soul, grace, perdition, predestination, standard controversial theology. But it provides these, this spirituality in a certain light that doesn't glare at those who read it. It suffuses this spirituality with humanity that feels natural, in a way. It feels almost personal. Yet at the heart of it all, this is about healing and hope in the very place of the ones we hold dear, family. All this set in the midst of a very normal, some would say boring, life. But that's reality, life isn't filled with surprises, plot twists, and sudden reveals. Life is often repetitive, a cycle on a day-to-day basis, minor in its alterations. The greatness of Marilynne Robinson lies with the fact that she writes such breath-taking novels based on this normalcy, this circularity that many of us hate. She opens our eyes on the potential beauty of real life. Her language is evanescent yet elegant, suffusing richness and familiarity that really feels, in a way, homely. The simplicity of it all, both prose and plot, is its strength, enriching and enlivening the reader. In this way, the novel is as real as it gets. It feels so genuine, thus having the rare power of producing tears in the most commonplace events. I remember being reduced to pieces by a joke, a simple joke. This master-work touched me countless of times, especially in the latter half of it. It is rarely acknowledged, but there are a great many books that are self-conscious of their produced melancholy, books that beg you to well-up and cry a river. We are often aware of these things, yet can't still help ourselves. Oh, the drama. But, I assure you this is not of those kinds. This will warm your heart, fill your body with joy, your thoughts with appreciation, with a certain grace, with that fleeting feeling of faith, maybe not in God, but in life. That it goes on. That there's always hope. That redemption is always at hand no matter what. \"There's so much to be grateful for...\" ...more I spent almost the entire book in a state of mild disappointment: the writing doesn't have the same rarefied beauty as that of Housekeeping or Gilead , and, for what felt like a long time, I found myself unastounded. As I read, I continued to hope that something would shift, that some word or paragraph would throw the entire piece into the sort of relief that would explain why the rest of the book was underwhelming. In general, if that hope surfaces, it's bound to remain unrealized. Not so, here.

In general, if that hope surfaces, it's bound to remain unrealized. Not so, here. Perhaps only a writer confident in the credibility she commanded through her previous work, and certainly only a writer of Robinson's exquisite patience, could have crafted a novel that waits, and waits, and waits until the bitter end to...what? Coalesce, unfurl, to emerge in its fullness in such a way that even the preceding dullness is shown to be necessary and, retroactively, remarkable in its own right. I don't mean to suggest that the epiphanic experience was prompted by a plot development: it wasn't something salient, was rather a gradual accumulation, a tipping point. For some people it might happen much earlier; for others, not at all. I don't know if I love Home the way I do her other two novels, but it is a striking feat. ...more After sleeping with the emotional state this book left me in, I have edited my review and changed it to a solid five stars. \"It is a book unsparing in its acknowledgment of sin and unstinting in its belief in the possibility of grace.

Thanks to the reviews of the members here, I have been much more successful at finding books that appeal to me and are worth my time. One of the books that I read this year as a result of GoodReads reviews was \u201cGilead\u201d by Marilynne Robinson. \u201cGilead\u201d was one of the most profoundly moving books I have ever read. It touched my heart in a way that few books ever do. It spoke of faith and forgiveness in such a reverent manner. I may have to review my top-10 list and find a way to make room for \u201cGilead\u201d on it. The thing about \u201cGilead\u201d is that it was a stand-alone novel. It had an ending that was natural and made sense. It left no room for a sequel. Robinson\u2019s latest novel set in the Iowa town of Gilead, \u201cHome\u201d, is not a sequel. Instead, it is a parallel novel. It takes place in the same time period as \u201cGilead\u201d, but is told from the point of view of the youngest Boughton child, Glory. Glory is a 38-year-old spinster who comes home to take care of her aging father. Some time after she arrives, her wayward brother, Jack, comes home after a twenty-year absence. \u201cHome\u201d examines the relationship that develops between Jack and Glory as they get to know each other and take care of their now-fragile father. Through Glory\u2019s loving and accepting eyes, we get to see a side of Jack that is quite different from the person John Ames sees in \u201cGilead\u201d. I had a few problems with \u201cHome\u201d. Most importantly, Robinson chose to use an third person narrator for this story instead of letting Glory tell it in first person as John Ames did in \u201cGilead\u201d. While the point of view is mostly Glory\u2019s, Robinson lets herself comment on other character\u2019s thoughts and feelings. It seems sloppy, especially when it happens mid-paragraph. It was also strange reading about Jack when I already knew a lot of his story from \u201cGilead\u201d. I knew who Della was and why he hadn\u2019t brought her with him. Knowing what I knew, it made his reactions to certain news stories make sense. However, he never once comes out and tells Glory the information he told John Ames in \u201cGilead\u201d about Della. Glory doesn\u2019t find out until the very end though a very implausible circumstance. It was very, very odd already knowing the story of Jack as \u201cHome\u201d is unfolding. That said, I really don\u2019t think \u201cHome\u201d stands on its own the way \u201cGilead\u201d did. I think if the reader hasn\u2019t read the first novel, there is no way he or she is going to understand what is going on in this one. On the other hand, \u201cGilead\u201d totally spoils \u201cHome\u201d. The whole thing is given away before the reader even picks it up. I also felt that I wanted to know more about Glory and the period between childhood and her return home. We get a bit of her story, but I would have liked it to have been more substantial. I am giving \u201cHome\u201d three stars because it is beautifully written. The imagery is subtle but amazingly well done. I could see the Boughton house, garden and barn so clearly in my mind. The setting really came to life and almost became a character of its own. I liked that we got to see a bit of Lila Ames as a real person instead of an idealized wife and mother. I\u2019m going to end this review with a question that kept coming to my mind. Why did the Boughtons choose Glory as the name for their youngest daughter? The other girls were named Faith, Hope and Grace. In my mind, I kept thinking that the fourth girl should be named Charity, not Glory. I thought Glory was an unusual choice. ...more \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0639 \u062d\u0642\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u062e\u0631\u062c \u0645\u0646

When one reads good literature, for instance, Cormac McCarthy, one is often struck by a turn of phrase or a passage. \"How aptly and poetically written,\" one thinks. This happens rarely with Robinson, because her prose lead us perfectly into the characters' lives. So it is only in hindsight that one identifies her prose as beautiful, and this only because one thinks of the story itself as true in the sense that truth causes one to feel lifted out of oneself. In \"Home\", Robinson combines the best of \"Housekeeping\" and \"Gilead\". On one hand, she describes with her characteristically oblique poignancy the life of the outcast. On the other she describes the long good life of faith with its struggles and its blessings. However, this book is not the same as \"Giliead\", in which faith was is painted much more darkly here than in \"Gilead\". Jack, the black sheep of Pastor Boughton's eight children, returns to visit his father in his old age. His father has a hard time seeing Jack again, whom he loves deeply, but who is still an occasional drunk, among other things. Jack's little sister is also home, tending to her father in her dottage. Jack is wary of them both, expecting their accusations. The father, Boughton, recieves his son with joy. However, as the book wears on, there is question about whether or not he has the strength to love his prodigal son. He summons Jack to his room to reprimand him for sins imagined and remembered, despite the great pain these talks give Jack. The character of Jack is memorable, he stands with a slouching elegance and has an irony and humor in all he says, like one long accustomed to failure and judgment. Boughton reminds me of what I know of a religious parent's strong drive to see their child go on the narrow path. The well meaning, and capacity for forgiveness do not lessen the force of displeasure, but rather give it weight. The judgement of a fool, or a bad man, or an enemy is unimportant. But the displeasure of a good, loving and even forgiving father is an almost unshakeable weight. Glory, the little sister, is however, taken with her brother. She remembers his humor, his wistful disposition, and the rarity of his presence from when she was growing up. He however suspects her of being ready with condemnation for his life, and it is only through her sustained effort at kindness that they become friends. She is ultimately the one that recieves a few confidences from Jack, and is able to give him some small comfort. One cannot call this story happy. If there is a common thematic thread in Marilynne Robinson's novels, it is the deep pain that people carry beneath their surfaces, and need for gentleness, forgiveness, and sustained compassion. This does not end the suffering that the world gives people, but it makes it, perhaps, bearable. This is the stuff to smoke. ...more I was disappointed with the muted passions of the characters in the novel and their unrealistic dwelling on spiritual and moral issues in isolation from the wellsprings of the usual ongoing connections and concerns in life. The prose has the same elegant and spare virtues as Robinson\u2019s previous books, \u201cHousekeeping\u201d and \u201cGilead\u201d, but the narrative often dragged to me due to excessive length relative to few substantive events and choices in action taken by the characters.

The prose has the same elegant and spare virtues as Robinson\u2019s previous books, \u201cHousekeeping\u201d and \u201cGilead\u201d, but the narrative often dragged to me due to excessive length relative to few substantive events and choices in action taken by the characters. In the late 50\u2019s, a dutiful middle-aged daughter, Glory, leaves her teaching job to returns to rural Gilead, Iowa, to take care of her frail elderly father, a saint-like pillar of the community he served as a Presbytarian minister. They are joined by an extended visit of the prodigal oldest son, Jack, who was a troublemaker in his youth and has been a source of worry while out of touch for nearly two decades. Outwardly, Christian kindness, forgiveness, and hope for redemption abounds in all their interactions, yet each of the three struggle with their largely hidden senses of guilt over past failures and inadequacies in their current roles in life. As the characters move toward a better understanding of each other, the reader is faced with a claustrophobia inducing sense of isolation. Aside from regular interactions of daily home life, there is little impingement of the outside world for most of the novel. When Jack and Glory refer to their past lives, no names or places are revealed. A TV is acquired, providing and small window of discussion about the ongoing conflicts of the Civil Rights movement. A rhythm of home life is marked by Jack regularly working on an old car and he and Glory tending daily to the garden. No one fights or displays strong emotions when they are together. No serious medical illnesses of the father calls for dramatic efforts in his care. There is beauty in this innovative model for exploring the meaning of \u201chome\u201d and exploration of whether adults can truly return to it. But the story almost leans toward the absurdist minimalism of \u201cWaiting for Godot\u201d or to the philosophical setting of Plato\u2019s Cave. But for me I need more realism or more content in the story to reap full pleasures of the resonance between the universal and particulars of life. ...more A wonderful read!

Home is about family, love, life and second chances. I really enjoyed Glory\u2019s account of what happens throughout the novel, although at one point I was tempted to question the reality of what she thinks or wonder about how other characters perceive the same incidents. Her narrative, however, is remarkable, cautious and meticulous when it comes to her brother and father, adding to the familial intensity (this is called a third person limited narrator if you are wondering and I guess Robinson intentionally wrote it this way to fit this book dialogically into the trilogy). I only read Housekeeping for Robinson by the way. The overarching theme in Home is God\u2019s Providence and how our conscious perception is always hindered by what we do not know or cannot understand. Our judgments and perception of others are often skewed because of our unconscious attachment to our subjective experiences and what we do not know. After all, we can only have our own experience to give, measure and judge other people and experiences upon. It would be interesting to read Lila and Gilead ; to complete the trilogy and the characters view on things \u2013 to completely understand the dialogicity of the three novels. Putting Housekeeping and Home side by side, the two are postmodern narratives, optimistic and vivacious. Housekeeping focuses on the initiation phase and getting the journey going, the journey of transience for Ruth and Sylvie. Home focuses on the return phase, the phase where all the doing is done, where the journey is about to end and the characters have been through all the battles and have the scars to show for it now (think why Jack\u2019s scar under his eye keeps popping up in the novel). It is interesting how Robinson shifts the traditional focus of most narratives, given that we view every novel in the journey motif frame. Home foregrounds what happens (or what does not happen) in the most inactive phase, the return phase. Jack\u2019s transformation has already happened after he returns back home, but all the tension ensues because of the characters\u2019 failure to understand this (even Jack himself) \u2026 All in all, Home is a wonderful read! Can\u2019t wait to get my hands on Gilead and Lila , especially Lila because of the narrator\u2019s transient background, which is reminiscent of a some kind of sequel for Housekeeping \u2019s Ruth and Sylvie.

Last week, I read Roxana Robinson's Cost and mentioned in my review that although it was a heavy melodrama, it would not make you cry. Since that and this book, Marilynne Robinson's Home are both included in the 1001 list and the two lady authors share the same surname (Robinson - although no relation), I read them with only a book in between. This is about relationships all anchored in a place we call HOME. Yes, the novel is aptly titled (unlike in Cost which up to now, I am not sure why it was titled that way). It's about enduring friendships between two men in cloth, i.e., Presbyterian priests. Mrs. Robinson has only written 3 novels in the span of 30 years and all those novels are award-winning. The second novel, Gilead , is about a preacher, Reverend Ames, who has a secondary role in this 3rd novel, Home . However, his friendship with this novel's main character, Reverend Robert Boughton is something that seems to be rare nowadays. It is a friendship that is true, loyal and is based on their deep faith in God. It is also about the relationship between siblings. Reverend Boughton and his wife (already deceased), had 8 all grownup children. In the story, all of them were mentioned and described but only 3 were active characters. These were Jack, the 45-y/o \"black sheep\" of the family, Glory, the 38-y/o youngest child who was ditched by her married lover and Teddy, the 43-y/o doctor who was the brightest in the family. The storytelling of Mrs. Robinson is so pure and lucid that you will hang on to each of her word and keep on turning each page as you are mesmerized with her beautiful prose. For me, what made her different from all the contemporary authors I've so far read is the way she builds her climax. If you are the reader who wants action in every page, this is not the book for you. There are no big dramatic dialogues, no earth-shaking events, no historical backdrop but you keep on turning the page because you always have that feeling that at any point, something big will come up. It's like there is a dagger that is lurking above the characters despite all of them being gentle, polite and kind to each other. Almost everything happened in their old family house located in a fictional town of Gilead in Iowa sometime in the 50's when life was a lot simpler and houses in heartland USA were still all surrounded by trees, garden and with a porch and a barn. The type that you see in the movies set in that era. Above all, this is about HOME. Ye, who are weary, come home says Glory to Jack at their farewell scene. That part that made me cry this morning. It was my fault. When reading a sentimental novel and I know I was nearing the climax, I play a mood music. You know what? All the characters in this book are cry babies. So, why not join the fun, I told myself. Just like in the movies the soundtrack can enhance the scene. This morning, I played the album \"Classical Heartbreakers\" and when I was on the last 20 pages, I was already one of the characters - tears swelling in my eyes. Read this. Reminisce the time that you were young and living with your parents and siblings. If you are not in this kind of family drama, just keep on reading and in the last 20 pages, I know you will cry. You will. ...more This book is one the quietest books I've ever read. Just give yourself time... In the beginning I didn\u2019t know what is going to happen, is it going to happen' at all.

They were hidden and undiscovered. Every inner monologue was complicatedly layered and deep while every verbal dialogue was poor and in the shadow. They were too scared to talk about what they were thinking, what actually was haunting them and initially that left me a bit anxious. But, nothing negatively anxious, because underneath - they just don\u2019t burst and explode. They are just not that kind of people. In the beginning I was the problem - I realise that now since in this hyped world I rarely find oasis. And this book, oh beauty, this book \u2013 elated me to a place where kindness, gracefulness and forgiveness live. Redemption is the main troubled theme. Imperfection of our kind and how we are silently touched by vows of unconditional love that tie and suffocate us, as much as they let us live. People in this book need quiet space and quiet time to lick their wounds, to heal and to prove themselves again. To find themselves worthy. And where else are you gonna come if not home when you need to hide yourself from the world. Where else will you stare at the white walls and find your heartbeat steadying. It's a meditation on values. Even if you can\u2019t mend your demons and even if you can\u2019t change things, even if you try all your life. I so immensely love Robinson's suffering style. It's difficult, it's so profound and in many ways heartbreakingly beautiful because grace, peace and wonder of this book will touch you and change you. This whole eloquent idea of their painful need for forgiveness and compassion is why I kept reading it. I enjoyed and I adore this book so much. It gives me such deep comfort knowing I can always return to it. ...more If I hadn't read Gilead, I wouldn't have expected to find a novel about the possibility of spiritual redemption in small-town early 60s Iowa, in which practically nothing happens, as compelling as any thriller.

There\u2019s not a lot of plot here, in fact some might find this absolutely dry and plodding. But I know these people, they are mine, and they are true. The \u201cgood\u201d daughter, Glory, youngest of eight, returns to take care of her aging father, the former reverend. He is still preternaturally bereft of his one lost sheep, his troubled son Jack, who suddenly appears. Glory and Jack thus find themselves in middle age, stuck in their childhood home together with their father in a final struggle to understand each other, and time is running out. The father\u2019s health is failing and Jack is returning after 20 years of total absence, not even showing for his mother\u2019s funeral. There\u2019s a lifetime of fresh tension to unpack here, and the history is revealed slowly and cleverly as the estranged try to make sense of \u201chome\u201d and family. Jack is a seeker, but he does not find, and his tragedy permeates the lives of the others, and the extended family, plus his father\u2019s best friend (the protagonist in the first story, Gilead). Robinson builds this slowly, almost in an old-fashioned way, but with deft writing and relentless honesty. It\u2019s a beautiful and tragic story, and how it turns out is totally unpredictable (my favorite type of novel). It takes on the biggest questions of predestination and the essential goodness of God. I could relate the mental contortions of Jack, who knows the bible far better than his father and his father\u2019s friend, and shyly takes them to task in a way that disturbs them deeply. His intelligence and wit is tragically lost on his sense of failure, keeping him on the edge of alcoholism and senseless petty crime. The first book, Gilead, introduces the fearful Jack as a sinister force \u2013 but Home shows the true character of this fated figure who can\u2019t find redemption and can\u2019t escape the judgment of those he loves. There is a kinship in the brother and sister, but both are nervous and awkward, despite only having each other to confide in. This book may make you cry, the desperate gaunt Jack who can\u2019t find love, his sister who laments her inability to help him, and the father who cannot pull his one failure back into the fold. I underlined so many great passages. This is the second in a series and it makes me want to go back to the first to see what I missed. If the third (Lila) is like the first two, the triad will be like one beautiful epic. It\u2019s the kind of story and writing that makes me love to read. There\u2019s goodness and heartache and all the things we experience, and told artfully and, most importantly, honestly. There aren\u2019t many books like this in the world. ...more The first use of the word Home in Marilynne Robinson's elegant, graceful slip back into the Pulitzer Winning Gilead , cannot fail to bring a gasp of recognition.

The tableau thats been painted, that has set its coming into fruition\u2014so vivid is the story and the language; it seems to fall as if wafting from her heart, effortless from her scribers pen. Home is...Timeless. Enduring. Brilliant as sunspray on water. It preys on the mind. Even if we never experienced this kind of home for ourselves, we know \"these\" kinds of homes from the hand just out of sight in all \"those\" stories or tales that we've loved, to a favorite quote penned by some wise sage that might adorn our favorite online page. (Giving a part of us away with, \"This is me. Who I am. I need these, they say as I mean to say.\") We all know in our knower, whether called from the depths or lived first hand, this kind of home is where the heart is . As you are drawn in through her prose, her every perspicacious use of the word home hits home in an evocative way; it's as timeless as the water rippling just past the bend, just out of sight...of all the rivers, the many creeks, every stream you've ever been blessed to lay your eyes upon. The Water Rippling Just Past The Bend: My Bedroom View The beauty of her landscape is spirit-stirring in it's simple brevity yet, still, all the more profound for it's indulgence; her breathtaking ability to transport us back to Gilead within this very landscape, is nothing short of exquisite. Transcendence through prose. Magnificent prose, which harkens back to that earlier time and place where decorum meant more than just the word, it was a value worth self-sacrifice, personal gain or even happiness, thus highly\u2014placed, along with others such as faith, family and home . The tragic figure of Jack, coming home after a twenty-year absence, could weigh heavily on the heart, if it had on the pen. Though Jack is a tormented soul, and has caused his family much anguish, the disquiet is just under the current that never comes to that full rush of foam; those turbulent sprays flying off a waterfall that have finally come home , from those calmer waters above, that ripple and flow, ever winding their way downstream. His sister, Glory, home again herself to care for their dying father, finds herself breathlessly awaiting the return of her cherished older brother after so many years of longing and a kind of fear for him but also having had a deep abiding faith that he was alive somewhere in the world, safe and being treated kindly. Glory, a good, godly, innately pious woman, we soon come to learn, has secrets of her own, and she herself has not always been treated with the kindness she bestows. One thing Glory has alongside her faith, is Hope. This brings to mind, dum spiro, spero \"While I breathe, I Hope.\" She gets this profound belief in hope from her ailing father, the patriarch of the family, Reverend Robert Boughton. He was always a loving, forgiving father, leant towards, as Presbyterians are wont to do, grace and understanding. He is also an intelligent man, an ecclesiastically fervent man, who derives great joy in arguing the mysteries of perdition , along with predestination and other scripture with his best friend, Gilead's Reverend John Ames. Although Jack has brought enough shame to the family name, Robert Boughton is a man who loves. With his whole heart. He lives by the Word. Not just words to him, they go to all he is\u2014as a man, a husband, a father. His prayers of a lifetime have been answered when Jack calls, out of the blue, and says he is coming home . She makes the word, Home , in this sense of the word\u2014 A Sacred one. A COMING HOME . [image error] \"That odd capacity for destitution, as if by nature we ought to have so much more than nature gives us. As if we are shockingly unclothed when we lack the complacencies of ordinary life. In destitution, even of feeling or purpose, a human being is more hauntingly human and vulnerable to kindnesses because there is the sense that things should be otherwise, and then the thought of what is wanting and what alleviation would be, and how the soul could be put at ease, restored. At home . But the soul finds its own home if it ever has a home at all.\" ~ Marilynne Robinson in Home ...more I thoroughly enjoyed Marilynne Robinson's Gilead and was looking forward to reading her follow-up, which contains many of the same beloved characters.

Her character studies are thorough, probing and provide clear analysis. Her knowledge of religion and the Bible is obviously seasoned and meditative. She capably imparted the atmosphere and the environment where those in her story lived. After acknowledging many of the positive qualities of this novel, I must state that this was not an entirely pleasant reading experience for me. I am not going to give a plot summary here, merely my points of view. It seemed to me that Robinson had taken far too long to develop her plot. Much of what was said, although her words were well stated, could have been pared down. This factor made it difficult to maintain interest and attention to what she was trying to relate. Another problem for me was that although I enjoy reading and learning about cultures and religions other than my own, the book continued page after page with Biblical tales, sermonizing and homilizing. Granted, the story involved a minister's family, but their lives seemed to have no other interests. As Glory, the main female character has started to think, \"...speaking the dialect of their slightly self-enamored and distinctly clerical family...\" Robinson has clearly spelled out what it means to come home, but this home seems to contain much discontent. Glory's role seems to be that of the Peacemaker and Housekeeper, as she attempts to ensure happiness for everyone else.We barely discovered her own interests and desires. Jack, the \"prodigal son\", has returned home after a mystifying absence of 20 years, with sketchy hints about the intervening time. We discover that he was always considered the bad boy of the eight children in this family, but it eventually becomes evident that he always lived in a state of unhappiness and unease with the routines and the ideals in the home. Robinson illustrates throughout his awkwardness and inability to express or earn his father's or siblings' love. Home is a sad and thought provoking novel. Although I grant that this author has written well and should earn at least 3 stars, I am giving this 2 stars for the content, which took too long to achieve my interest. ...more I'm having a tough time with this one.

And companionship, it turns out, is what all the lonely people in this book are seeking. Set in the same Iowa town, just a short distance from Rev. John Ames, the dying narrator of Gilead, the events in Home take place concurrently with those of that other novel. This time, however, we're in the house of Rev. Robert Boughton, Ames's longtime friend, who's equally close to putting on \"imperishability.\" The publisher claims these two novels can be read separately, but that's not fair to the profound relationship between them nor, I think, to the way Home depends on its predecessor for detail and resonance. Indeed, as meditative and spare as Gilead is, it now seems downright hyperactive next to this ruminative new volume. Rev. Ames, you will recall, spiced his reflections on life and God with wild tales of his one-eyed grandfather, who rode with the abolition terrorist John Brown. There are deadly adventures in Home, too, but they take place offstage, and they're never mentioned, only outlined by the pained silence of those who cannot forget. Almost all the physical movement of this story is exhausted in its opening pages with the return of Glory, the youngest of Boughton's eight children. Robinson writes in the third person, but we see the events that unfold over the following months in 1950 from Glory's point of view. Her father is overjoyed to see her, and neither of them mentions the collapsed engagement and abandoned career that have brought her back to live in her childhood house at the age of 38. \"Nothing about that house ever did change,\" she thinks, \"except to fade or scar or wear.\" Now, forced to abandon dreams of a husband and a child of her own, she's haunted by the question, \"What does it mean to come home?\" With so much nursing and housekeeping to be done, both of them can pretend that Glory has returned entirely for her father's sake. \"She did not permit herself to brood, strong as the urge was sometimes,\" Robinson writes. \"She could decide nothing about her life. She did not want to think about her life.\" Their quiet routine is soon interrupted by the return of another wayward Boughton child. The black sheep in this otherwise happy family, Jack was a petty thief and a brooding drunk who skipped town 20 years before, leaving behind his teenage girlfriend, a baby and a cloud of shame. During the intervening years, Jack continued to torture his parents by spurning every offer of assistance no matter how desperate his circumstances. When he finally returns -- thin, pale, unkempt -- Glory barely recognizes him. Though she once idolized him, now he seems to her \"the weight on the family's heart, the unnamed absence, like the hero in a melancholy tale.\" But their father -- a man of \"tireless tenderness\" -- is giddy, thrilled by the possibility that his boundless love may finally open the heart of his wary, rueful child. This is a version of the Prodigal Son that picks up where the Gospel parable stops, after the extravagant feast, when the excitement of reunion fades in the awkwardness of the next day, and then the next. Robinson has constructed a plot so still that it seems at times more a series of tableaux than a novel. The tension in Home is palpable but invisible. Rev. Boughton, Glory and Jack move through domestic chores and hesitant conversations, fraught with the danger of confession or rapprochement or affection. Glory and her father are determined to make their love known to Jack, but the possibility of his bolting again renders them all timid and formal. \"They had always been so careful of him,\" Robinson writes, \"almost afraid to touch him. There was an aloofness about him more thoroughgoing than modesty or reticence. It was feral, and fragile.\" Jack is a man in the throes of a spiritual crisis, which Robinson captures with the most exquisite precision. An alcoholic clutching at the edges of sobriety, he's tempted to think he can clean himself up, but he's desperately afraid of failing, knowing that one more slip could kill both him and his long suffering father. With a mixture of affection, embarrassment and annoyance, he realizes that his father is \"afraid to die because of me. To leave me behind, still unregenerate.\" Writing one novel about a minister's family is asking for trouble; writing a second seems downright unrepentant, the kind of misjudgment that could land a reputable literary author in a Christian bookstore or with a cozy series on the BBC. But Robinson, who teaches at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, is unlikely to suffer either fate; her books are toxic to sentimentality. Even more than their stylistic beauty, what's miraculous about Gilead and Home is their explicit focus on spiritual affliction, discussed in the hard terms of Protestant theology. Robinson uses the words \"grace,\" \"salvation\" and \"prayer\" frequently and without embarrassment and without drifting into the gassy lingo of ecumenical spirituality. Her characters cower in the shadow of perdition. Though as a teenager Jack seemed to have paid no attention to his father's sermons, now, amid the ruins of his adult life, he's hypnotized by a sense of his worthlessness even as he feels \"a certain spiritual hunger.\" Why, he wonders, could he never be a part of this wonderful family? What has drawn him again and again to hurt them and himself? \"I don't really know what to do with myself,\" he tells Glory. \"I'm a scoundrel.\" As a disquisition on the agonies of family love and serial disappointment, Home is sometimes too illuminating to bear. During a long, candid conversation that serves as the crisis of the novel, Jack's father confesses, \"So many times, over the years, I've tried not to love you so much. I never got anywhere with it, but I tried.\" And then he manages to ask, without rancor of any kind, \"What I'd like to know, is why you didn't love us. That is what has always mystified me.\" Although there's much sadness here, it's always cradled in Robinson's voice. \"This life on earth is a strange business,\" she writes, but somehow that business sounds like a more familiar home in these discerning pages.
