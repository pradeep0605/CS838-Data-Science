Did I want to read about a Professor with a memory span of 80 minutes and the Housekeeper who assists him? I'm so glad I decided to read it and I'm happy to have my own copy. This story of memory, math, building a pseudo-family where no relationship has existed before is full of love and compassion. The emotions are mostly expressed in mathematical theorems, cooking and random touch, but it is palpable throughout the book. I had to remind myself repeatedly that this is a novel, not a memoir. It feels like life, a life beautifully lived. The emotions are still high as I write this review. The blending of the math into the arc of life is amazing. I am a math-phobe and always have been. I could feel my resistance wearing down while reading and a subtle understanding of why others love the world of numbers beginning to grow. The Professor, and the housekeeper, would be pleased. Highly recommended for its sensitive treatment of relationships. Addendum 1/5/13: I realize that I truly love this book and it has only risen in my esteem over time. Therefore I am going to change its rating to the 5 stars it probably should have been initially. ...more \u201cThe Professor loved prime numbers more than anything in the world.<---F>\u201d \"To me, they were just numbers</---F>.\u201d says the new housekeeper. \u201c\u201dWhat\u2019s your shoe size?\u201d This was the Professor\u2019s first question, once I had announced myself as the new housekeeper.

And they're all here in <+++>The Housekeeper and the Professor</+++>, which Ms. Ogawa wrote in 2007. The Professor is of mathematics and has amnesia; the housekeeper is devoted and has a son. This melange constitutes the cast of a charming story of mathematics and love, subjects with a connection that is less than obvious. But there is a connection and it is fundamental and profound. For a mathematician, defined by intensity of temperament not level of education, numbers are not simply classified as 'kinds' or 'types'. They are living species with distinctive genetic characteristics, with real family resemblances and lasting relationships, indeed with personalities. Some are rare, some shy, some awkward, some maddeningly unpredictable, some may be hidden in infinity, some are waiting, desperate to be identified, and some may even be the last of their line, but we can't be sure. The ultimate mathematical accolade afforded to any number is to give it a family name, a formula by which all its relatives can be identified even those we haven't met yet. Thus the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 10 equals 55. But that is just this number's first name, as it were. It's family name is n(n-1)/2+n. All the numbers, 1 to n, in this family are related to each other and have this name. The numbers themselves have always known this, we as thinking human beings who aren't numbers, took some considerable time to recognise the fact. Numbers, as living things, of course interbreed. They may be members of different families simultaneously. Plotting out the sister and brothers and cousins and aunts and the in-laws of numerical familial relations is what keeps mathematicians up at night. There are so many interesting genetic modifications, so many hidden liaisons, so many queer numbers waiting, and proudly wanting, to be outed. And the discovery of new families increases the possible connections among all the families. There's no end to the fun. But why is such an appreciation of numbers of significance in a piece of fiction about amnesia? I think the answer to this question is best found through a comparison: The American novelist, Nicole Krauss, published her first book, Man Walks Into a Room, in 2002. Her novel has the same premise as Ogawa's, namely the condition of amnesia in a man who has suffered severe trauma. Both books then explore the relationship between memory and feelings in the victim - on the residual emotional bonds the victim maintains from his past, as well as their ability to create new relationships of intimacy. Ogawa's amnesiac is even more disabled than Krauss's because the Professor's condition is anterograde amnesia which inhibits the creation of any new memories. So his memory 'store' consists of his life up to his early 30's plus the last 80 minutes, which recycles like a CarCam with a 16GB memory card. The condition of Krauss's victim is merely retrograde, meaning historical memories only are affected. He has, as it were, started a new reel in the film of his life; the entirety of this reel is available to him. It is clear from the beginning that Krauss's story is going to end tragically. Samson Greene, her protagonist, whose trauma erased his memory back to his adolescence, is an emotional goner. His wife is not merely a stranger to him, she also evokes not the least emotional response in him; nor do any of the mementoes, photographs and other trinkets of their life together. It is possible in fact that Samson is permanently crippled emotionally. Loss of memory is the equivalent of a comprehensive loss of affection and affective ability. He, sadly for the reader, also has not the slightest inclination to re-kindle his marriage and considers himself none the worse for it. He is not cruel, merely ennuied; his strongest emotion is melancholy Ogawa tells a very different story. Although her mathematics Professor has a blank memory from his early 30's, his emotions are still stirred by the son of his housekeeper with whom he immediately feels an intense relationship of care. Despite the fact that the Professor must re-create this relationship every day from scratch, it in fact deepens on the basis of the mathematical tutorial that he has undertaken with the boy and his mother. His memory is blank, yet he has some level of residual emotional instinct and his capacity for relationship to his past life still exists. I think that it is only in comparison with each other that both these novels can be recognised as profound metaphysical statements, contradictory to each other, but self-verifying by the protagonists, perhaps even to their authors. If I am correct, the responses of readers will depend primarily on the fundamental presumptions they hold not just about life but about existence itself. Here's why: Krauss presents a decidedly Aristotelian vision of the world. Samson Greene is a physical scientist. He is a materialist in the sense that he lives in a world of strict cause and effect. Memory is a necessary causal condition for Samson\u2019s emotions. Everything must have a cause and all causes are material in character. So no memory, no emotion. The cause/effect chain in his brain has been interrupted. The result is not simply that he doesn\u2019t recognise his wife, he doesn\u2019t recognise himself. He has lost his identity. He cannot remember his own name. While he mildly regrets these facts, he feels nothing more about them. Ogawa's Professor is Platonist rather than Aristotelian. He lives in a world of Platonic forms - the apotheosis of which are numbers - that are independent not only him but of the world itself. Numbers are \"contained in the notebooks of God himself.\" In effect numbers are attributes of God: eternal, perfect, trustworthy, and, most significantly, uncreated. They are not part of any chain of cause and effect. Yet their reality mysteriously governs the world. They are unaffected by the Professor\u2019s injury and therefore provide what is a spiritual continuity in a materially interrupted life. While these number-forms cannot compensate for the Professor\u2019s material deficiency, they permit him to keep his identity, which for a Platonist is a spiritual not a material entity. Numbers also mediate his current, otherwise fleeting, relationships, which spiritual things as well. Consequently, Krauss\u2019s story is one of irretrievable tragedy. Irretrievable because the gap in causality can never be recovered. The gap is a hole into which Samson's existence has fallen. He continues to be in the world but as a fundamentally altered being. That same gap exists for the Professor, and is just as materially unrecoverable. But the number-forms maintain their influence and \u2018remind\u2019 his material body on a daily basis of their existence, and his. They evoke the Professor's emotions, particularly love, which are not materially but spiritually-grounded. The Professor is debilitated but his ontology, his mode of being, is what it has always been. Samson suffers mildly but has no real grief. He is now something other than human. He will probably function adequately and be perceived as normal, if somewhat aloof, by the world at large. The Professor on the other hand, may be pitiable to some, like his sister-in-law, and he does suffer, often intensely. But he is not pitiable to his housekeeper and her son. Through practical love and instinctive respect, they adapt to his condition and learn to live in his Platonic world, to their benefit as well as his. In a small but important way, he has improved the world. I have no idea if Ogawa has ever read Krauss, or if she has whether she intended to write a fictional riposte to Krauss\u2019s Aristotelian materialism. Regardless, the two books certainly help to demonstrate what I think is the essential point of the other: It makes a fundamental difference in our lives what implicit philosophy we assimilate or adopt, perhaps without any awareness of the event. Perhaps we are simply born into one tendency or another, without the possibility of choice. In either case, I am an inveterate Platonist and, like the Professor, find numbers unaccountably comforting. Who knows, they might even help me through my increasingly deficient aged memory. So for me Ogawa has written something far more than a merely charming piece of fiction. She has, either intentionally or inadvertently, addressed a fundamental issue of human existence. Thank you Ms. Ogawa. Postscript on why Number Theory is important <+++>The Housekeeper and the Professor</+++> contains a great deal about what is called Number Theory. Many people have reported in their reviews and comments that much of this theory seems incomprehensible. I think that part of the reason for this is that it appears to be entirely abstract. But in fact Number Theory is very important in everyday life. Among other things, it is the foundation of measurement and what measurement actually means. Without understanding this we can get vary confused about what gets reported in things like economics and social sciences generally. Numbers define what is called a metric; they never exist on their own but only with some other group of numbers. This group constitutes a metric - for example, let's simply define a scale from, say 1 t0 10. The choice of the units in which to express things on this scale - pounds, dollars, votes etc. - can be left aside for the moment because the importance of the units pales into insignificance compared with the choice of metric. When we measure something, we place whatever it is on a location on the metric, say at $5.50 as the dollar value of something. What we don't do is to assign the value on the metric to the thing being measured. In other words the thing being measured becomes a property of the metric. The metric does not become a property of the thing. The way to lie with numbers is to pretend that numbers are a 'property' of anything. They are not. When we measure we assign a property to a metric. This distinction is important because it prevents us from thinking that the thing being measured has some objective value that is inherent to itself. Measurement is always about the value of something: weight, height, temperature, price, importance, etc. Politicians and economists, and indeed con men of all sorts, like to make believe that value is somehow inherent in what they are proposing or opposing. It isn't. Value lies in the choice of metric. For example, in Britain the proposed High Speed Line from London to the Midlands looks like a winner on a government metric of travel time reduction; but it's a dead loss if the metric used is anything to do with destruction of countryside-beauty. And there no way to compare these two metrics without constructing another one ad infinitum. The political game is one of establishing your metric as definitive, not because it is the best one but because it gets what you want. A few billion pounds off one way or the other in estimates are are marginal significance. Number Theory may be understood as thinking about alternative metrics, that is alternative scales of value. A scale say running in equal increments from 1 to 10 has very different implications than one that proceeds from 1 cubed (=1) to 10 cubed (=1000). When something is placed at 5.50 on either of these scales, the resulting relative values are vastly different. Any error in the choice of a metric is orders of magnitude more important than an error made on a metric. This is why statistical analysis, which is the analysis of error on a metric, is so often either misleading or entirely irrelevant. There are two types of measurement typically discussed in textbooks: Cardinal measurement and Ordinal measurement. The latter is simply the placing of things in their correct order on a metric. Ordinal metrics are, despite this simplicity, infinitely precise. There is always room to put a measured object between any two existing objects. All measurement of value is ordinal measurement. Cardinal measurement is what many erroneously think of as 'scientific measurement.' However it is neither scientific, nor is it really measurement in any practical sense. Cardinal measurement is actually pure mathematics. It considers numbers and their relations solely to each other at any degree of precision desired. Cardinal measurement is concerned mainly not with the numbers themselves but with the intervals between them. When scientists , social or physical, then claim or imply that these intervals exist with similar significance in the world outside of mathematics, they are, as noted above, assigning numbers to things, a fundamental and duplicitous No No (Economics recognises this implicitly, grudgingly on the part of its Aristotelians, with its concept of declining marginal utility). In my review above of Ogawa's book I allude to these two types of measurement when I make the distinction between Aristotelian and Platonist thinking. Platonists, because they hold with the independent existence of numbers, and their metrics, they wouldn't think of degrading numbers by allowing them to be properties of anything. They are themselves, and themselves alone. They are after all God-like. As the Professor told his Housekeeper, \"The mathematical order is beautiful precisely because it has no effect on the real world.\" Aristotelians are a lot less fussy about how they treat numbers. They casually refer to numbers as properties of things without thinking carefully about what they're doing. They act as if numbers do have a material and causal effect on the world. They casually assign these magnificent entities to the most meaningless and banal events. Aristotelians fling cardinal measurements around with gay abandon, hoping to deflect attention from the metrics they are really peddling. This is why they are employed by charlatans and crooks to convince us of unhealthy things. Sociologically and psychologically, Aristotelian, cardinal, measurement separates and distinguishes us. It pretends to identify us by assigning numbers to us: height, weight, IQ, race (yes race is a number). It establishes what it claims is our independent existence. This is perhaps its most insidious ideological effect. Platonist, ordinal, measurement shows how we are related to one another, how we are ordered on an infinite number of metrical scales. Each of these metrics is part of reality but not one of them is definitive, even in combination. Platonist measurement thus respects both our individuality and our interdependence. My fourteen year-old grandson challenged me recently to demonstrate the paradoxes involved in Aristotelian cardinal measurement. I asked him to draw a straight line with a ruler on a sheet of paper, which he duly did. I then asked him to measure the length of the line. He did so and reported a length of 15 centimetres. I disagreed and said I read 15.1 centimetres. He then confirmed my re-reading of the ruler. I then challenged his confirmation and measured the line again with a compass and a more precise ruler. This technique yielded a length of 15.08 centimetres. At this point the penny dropped for him. No matter how precisely we measured the line segment, there was always a greater level of precision possible. Greater precision would always show the 'error' of less precise measurements. The problem only came about however because we implicitly presumed that the measurement we were making was a property of the line. Demonstrably therefore this cannot be the case. When we ordinally measure the line we assign it to the numerical scale, to say, exactly 15 centimetres. The line in a sense becomes an attribute of this scale which may have any number of other lines we are interested in assigned to it. No uncertainty then: the line is 15 centimetres, snuggled right in there between 15.1 and 14.9, in ordinal simplicity. In the novel, the Professor attaches notes to his jacket to remind himself, or actually to inform himself anew every 80 minutes, about ideas and things in his life, like the existence of his housekeeper. Sometimes these notes fall off or are changed by either the Professor or his housekeeper. Crucially, however, they do not constitute a part of the Professor, they are not a property of him or his identity. Rather they are icons, as it were, pointing elsewhere, recalling either his place in the order of the world or his place in the order of mathematics. They are reminders of Platonist metrics in other words. This is yet another indication of Ogawa's intention. In short, getting a basic grasp of Number Theory is not important only for mathematicians. It's an essential skill in modern life in which numbers are used to justify or condemn almost everything from taxes to immigration. It's unlikely that informed judgments are possible without that skill. The skill is an aesthetic one. It requires taste to distinguish a better metric. This is one reason to listen to music, especially classical music, very carefully. Music is metrical sound, numerical scales for the ear. The instruments in a Beethoven symphony become ordered in and through the score. The score itself, a combination of aural metrics, remains what it is, a way to order the instrumental parts. It does not become a property of the instruments. And there are better scores than others. These are metrics that include lesser metrics without erasing or denigrating their lesser brethren. Such are Beethoven's to Hayden's symphonies for example. In mathematics this is expressed in Set Theory wherein one set, a metric, is part of a larger set, a special case of the larger set, just like Newtonian Physics is a special case of Relativity Physics. To be fair though, Ogawa thinks that American baseball is equally effective in making the point about metrics and how they show up in daily life. The metrical dialectic between pitchers and batters is her most important numerical metaphor. Aesthetic judgments like this are different from other sorts of judgments. But they are not arbitrary. They involve a distinctive form of logic. The American philosopher C. S. Peirce called this logic 'abductive' to distinguish it from the more well published (Aristotelian) logics of inductive and deductive reasoning. Real genius in mathematics is always shown abductively. Induction and deduction is typically only used to show this genius for what it is. Toward the end of Ogawa's book she has the Professor write a formula as a insistent communication to his sister-in-law: This formula is known as Euler's Identity after the 18th century Swiss mathematician. It has been called the most beautiful formula in mathematics. Its beauty lies in its synthesis of at least four fundamentally different mathematical universes: Transcendental, Imaginary, Natural, and Irrational numbers. Each of these mathematical families has a genetic character as distinct as, say, the genetics of an earthworm and a human being. On the face of it, they should have no family connections whatsoever. But this is precisely what Euler's Identity shows they do have. It is an unparalleled 'abduction' that couldn't be arrived at by deduction or induction. The significance of Euler's Identity in the book is reasonably clear: It is the Professors way of expressing the synthesis of the worlds that he, his sister-in-law, his housekeeper, and her son are living in. Each is included without being denied, just as each mathematical family is included without being negated or changed in the Identity. A brilliant literary as well as mathematical insight therefore. ...more The Housekeeper and the Professor is a charming and enjoyable novella about eponymous Professor of mathematics who due to accident years earlier suffers from peculiar form of amnesia and while he remembers everything from the past his current memory lasts only eighty minutes, and as a reminder of this fact he has fitting note pinned to his suit.

In fact Professor has plenty notes on him that rustle when he walks. It is a story about his housekeeper, young single mother and her son named by Professor, in honor of root sign since his head is flat, Root. And finally the story revolves about numbers, whole range of numbers. Prime, natural, amicable, perfect, triangular and so on. Well, being myself mathematical dimwit I didn\u2019t think reading about equations, proofs and Fermat Last Theorem could be so engaging. For Professor numbers are comforting and solving some mathematical puzzle leaves him peaceful and at ease. And these passages devoted to the beauty of mathematics I found especially captivating. In mathematics is order and logic that I admire and mystery and beauty that regretfully I not always can comprehend. You could think that being limited to the world of numbers only the Professor is excluded from the outside world. Yes, in some way he is. He lives in unkempt cottage, his clothes remember better times and he barely leaves his refuge. But he almost immediately creates a bond with his housekeeper\u2019s ten years old son. And reading about their relationship, the way he cares about the boy is such heart-warming even if every time Professor has to start his day looking at his clothes to find a proper note reminding him who the boy and his mother are. <---A>Y\u014dko Ogawa</---A> wrote this story with elegance and understanding, fortunately avoiding saccharine undertone that can be found in some novels concerning disabilities issue. We can see Professor in his best and worst moments. We see old man in shabby clothes who pays no attention to his dowdiness and hygienic matters. We see him thinking and pointing at the sky to indicate the evening star that is about to show. We perfectly understand his fear of crowded places and can comprehend the fact when he reduces baseball game to numbers and statistics or writes a formula to end an arguing. Because numbers always would give him sense of order and harmony with himself and the world. 3.5/5 ...more A highly polished, smooth, shining surface of a novel that was exquisitely crafted from start to finish.

The voice was so understated and matter-of-fact that I would have had little trouble believing that this was an actual account of a real housekeeper remembering her experiences. There were very few authorial flourishes and all of them were appropriately put into the mouth of the strange, afflicted Professor, a math genius whose short-term memory only lasts 80 minutes. A premise like that can be in danger of becoming a gimmick, a crutch for the plot to rely on to provide tension, as reliable as a countdown clock in an apocalyptic film. However, that did not happen here. If anything, sometimes Ogawa blurred time together- she only used the premise when needed. The time-bomb ticking mattered less than Ogawa's use of it to demonstrate the selfless care and devotion of a housekeeper and her son to this debilitated, nervous old man. The other quirk of the Professor's memory is that he can remember everything that happened to him before 1975. This means it will always be that year in his mind. This was interesting as well because it allowed Ogawa to explore, with a very light touch, what \"time\" is made up of- her answer seems to be a combination of objects, people, and the sort of pop culture that connects you with a wider world, the famous figures that help you see time passing in your own life. The housekeeper's tale is self-effacing and modest, with only the barest of facts given to let the reader know why her relationship with the Professor is possible, and why it means so much to her. The rare moments where she breaks down and tells a story about her emotions mean that much more because of it. Her life is one of work, hardship, frequent disrespect and degradation, and she has no opportunity to really escape it. Thus her interactions with the Professor, who only remembers the last 80 minutes, and will therefore explain things again and again and still feel just as excited about doing so, allow her a share in beauty and kindness and higher understanding that has never been within the possibilities of her experience. The 80 minutes is about exploring and re-exploring, having the freedom to try again and be secure that there will be no judgement of your failures. What would that be like? What sort of gift would it be for a woman whose whole life has been judgment and avoiding judgment and getting by with her head down? Her joy is quiet and contained and hidden, subject to the permission of authority figures for its existence, not to be depended on, as likely to quickly disappear as not. But for some little time, this woman is able to look into \"God's notebook,\" with a patient teacher and precious privacy: \"In my imagination, I saw the creator of the universe sitting in some distant corner of the sky, weaving a pattern of delicate lace so fine that even the faintest light would shine through it. The lace stretches out infinitely in every direction, billowing gently in the cosmic breeze. You want desperately to touch it, hold it up to the light, rub it against your cheek. And all we ask is to be able to re-create the pattern, weave it again with numbers, somehow, in our own language; to make even the tiniest fragment on our own, to bring it back to earth.\" This ethereal daydream represents the height of the emotion that this book reaches. It is a whispering sort of book, a calm and nostalgic Sunday with nowhere to be sort of book. It is the sort of book I actually think would benefit from being read aloud by a woman with a wise old voice and a solid, but sometimes somewhat fragile demeanor. The major fault I found with this book was that... there were no faults. The author seemed perfectly separated from her subject, at her observational best, understanding, but uninvolved. I liked that, in a sense, after reading so many books where authors are clearly working out their own issues on the page. I liked that this seemed like a genuine attempt to understand something outside of the Self. I also liked that this never bowed to our modern, confessional needs to know everything- she always left the mystery, always respected the limits of what her tale would reasonably know or respectfully want to know, and left it to us to guess the rest or to be discreet enough to leave the characters' secrets alone. However, her skill was such that the story was told so smoothly. So smoothly, too smoothly for my taste. You could almost miss the bumps in the road- the language almost never changed, the tone didn't alter, nor, I think most importantly, did your sense of being well taken care of by the author. I felt so safe in Ogawa's hands that I never feared for the characters, nor was able to consequently work up a great passion about any of them in any way. I knew that each of them would be given a fitting, lovely conclusion that wrapped up the tale with dignity, ending it not with a bang, but a whisper. It made me respect Ogawa's skill so much. It made me pay attention, and I understood that certain scenes had more power because of this almost never changing tone, and her plain, even language, even in moments of stress or crisis for the characters. I confess that I was looking for ragged edges by the end- looking to find fault with her for not keeping to her 80 minutes, looking for some outbursts or ill-chosen words. She receded so much from me that I wanted some of the author back- and she refused to appear. I will say that it has been a long time since I've wished for that. I've not often had the need. Ultimately, I think that when I see this book on my shelves I will remember a sense of quiet, smile a little bit remembering the unique passion for mathematics, and I will think of the word \"polished\", but that will be all. It shone softly, not a hair out of place, and I can already feel it fading from my mind. That's why I can't rate it higher, even though, as I've stated, I can't find a single flaw with the writing. Oh well book. As a favorite character of mine almost said- perhaps it is your perfections that make us imperfect for one another. ...more A light but enjoyable read that scatters numbers, and facts about the brain, rather like The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time ( http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... ).

However, in other respects, it's very different, being set in Japan and being primarily about friendship. The eponymous housekeeper is a young single mother (herself the only child of a single mother) with a ten-year-old son. She becomes daily housekeeper to a former maths professor whose head injury in 1975 means he only remembers the most recent 80 minutes, plus things before 1975, nearly 20 years before the story is set (~1992). Numbers are now the professor's life; he works on problems for magazine competitions, and he comes alive when he spots numbers or patterns to explain to his increasingly interested housekeeper. When he discovers she has a son, he is adamant that he must come to the house after school and in the holidays: he adores children, and thinks their needs (or his exaggerated perception of them) trump everything else. Thus a relationship is built between the prof and the boy (nicknamed Root), based on numbers and baseball statistics. His short memory span makes him an incredibly patient teacher. The practicalities and humour of coping with the prof's condition are well portrayed, and the relationships are very touching. And yet, despite the efforts of the housekeeper and her son, the professor's capacity for joy is literally limited. Is there much point having any sort of friendship with or giving happiness to someone who will not remember it? The housekeeper and her son learn so much from the professor, but does he get anything meaningful in return? Despite all the notes, he has to start each day, each situation, anew. (The hire and fire nature of a housekeeping agency has parallels.) Some of the maths may be a little obscure for some readers, but not fully understanding it shouldn't impair enjoyment of the book. The prof's message is not about right answers, but listening to and feeling numbers, and there are times when the passion borders on religious, \"I needed this eternal truth...

It is a mark of the author's writing that the fourth character, the linchpin of the story remains in the shadows but no more on that, otherwise I'd have to mark this with a 'spoiler' flag. The book is a short read, mesmerising in its intensity and absolutely unique, I've never read another book even slightly like this one. Certainly I've never read anything about logarithms, mathematical conjectures and proofs that I ever even understood, let alone enjoyed. But now I know a bit more about maths, and wish I'd had a teacher who could have shown me the magic rather than the grind behind numbers. ...more This is a quietly wonderful book.

I just know that about 50 pages from the end of the story, I found myself digging in my heels, wanting to linger over every last word. The Housekeeper and the Professor is a gently written, beautiful musing on the nature of friendship and familial love. And it\u2019s a peek into a brilliant mind\u2014one that sees the entire visible world in terms of the mathematics that underpins it; one that effortlessly finds a connection between his new housekeeper\u2019s birth date and the three-digit number etched on the back of his wristwatch; one that is most alive in the world of formulas and theorems. (Several formulas appear in the narrative, but as someone who is definitely not a math person, let me assure you that you don\u2019t have to be into numbers to appreciate the story. And you can always let your eyes glaze over a bit on the math if you want\u2014you won\u2019t miss anything crucial.) With all of the little torn bits of paper I used to mark my favorite passages, before long my copy of the book started to look something like the Professor\u2019s suit. I\u2019ll leave you with a handful of them: \u201cI uncovered propositions that existed out there long before we were born. It\u2019s like copying truths from God\u2019s notebook, though we aren\u2019t always sure where to find this notebook or when it will be open.\u201d \u2026 The Professor picked up a branch and began to scratch something in the dirt. ... The withered stick gracefully carved [ his ] thoughts into the dry earth, and before long the lacy pattern of the formula was spread out at our feet. (Possibly I like this passage so much because it reminds me of another Man I love who once stooped to write mysteries in the dirt.) He treated [ my son ] exactly as he treated prime numbers. For him, primes were the base on which all other natural numbers relied; and children were the foundation of everything worthwhile in the adult world. In my imagination, I saw the creator of the universe sitting in some distant corner of the sky, weaving a pattern of delicate lace so fine that even the faintest light would shine through it. The lace stretches out infinitely in every direction, billowing gently in the cosmic breeze. You want desperately to touch it, hold it up to the light, rub it against your cheek. And all we ask is to be able to re-create the pattern, weave it again with numbers, somehow, in our own language; to make even the tiniest fragment our own, to bring it back to earth. And maybe the best description of a thunderstorm I\u2019ve ever read: The trees suddenly began to tremble and the sky grew dark. The line of hills on the horizon, faintly visible just a moment before, disappeared in the gloom. There was a rumbling in the distance. \u201cThunder!\u201d we said together, as the rain began to fall in enormous drops. The pounding on the roof echoed through the room. I stood up to close the windows, but the Professor stopped me. \u201cLeave them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels good to have them open.\u201d The curtains billowed in the breeze, letting the rain pour in on our bare feet. It was cool and refreshing, just as the Professor had said. The sun had vanished and the only light in the garden was the faint glow from the lamp above the kitchen sink. Small birds flitted among the drooping, tangled branches of the trees, and then the rain obscured everything. ...more 3.5 After our first full day visiting Japan in 2011, I saw a baseball game on TV (had to be a replay because it was December): the Yakult Swallows versus the Hanshin Tigers. I recognized Matt Murton of the Tigers who'd briefly played for the Chicago Cubs and the name of the 40-year-old Miyamoto. Two evenings later, in Nara, we got caught up in a small parade on the main street and as it ended, a young man straddling a bicycle caught up with us to ask if we were Americans and, next, if we knew Ame 3.5 After our first full day visiting Japan in 2011, I saw a baseball game on TV (had to be a replay because it was December): the Yakult Swallows versus the Hanshin Tigers. I recognized Matt Murton of the Tigers who'd briefly played for the Chicago Cubs and the name of the 40-year-old Miyamoto. Two evenings later, in Nara, we got caught up in a small parade on the main street and as it ended, a young man straddling a bicycle caught up with us to ask if we were Americans and, next, if we knew American baseball. When I asked if he knew American baseball, his response was \"of course\". (I soon understood his \"of course\" simply meant \"yes\".) His favorite Japanese team was the Hanshin Tigers, so I mentioned Murton, and he gave some other names of Americans playing in Japan. I mentioned Fukudome* (who was then playing for the Cubs) and he countered with Sammy Sosa! The young man walked with us to the hotel where we said good-bye, and he seemed reluctant to part. I bring this up not only because in this book the Hanshin Tigers are the favorite team of the professor and the son of the housekeeper; but because baseball (along with mathematics) is the way the housekeeper and her son communicate with the professor. I don't speak Japanese and the young man's English was limited, yet we communicated -- and quite satisfactorily -- through the names of baseball players. This book is very different from the other works of Ogawa that have been translated into English. Anyone reading this first and then the others might be in for a shock. And while I prefer her Revenge and The Diving Pool , her narratorial choice here (as usual) is intriguing. The housekeeper tells us nothing of how hard and lonely her own life must be, as if to point out how little she knows of the professor's feelings. She never questions the giving of friendship to a man who will have no memory of it eighty minutes later. The professor may live in a sort of bubble, but surely the housekeeper doesn't, though that is what she presents to us. Because of these choices, on the surface the story might seem mostly a sweet one (and it is, though it's never saccharine) but I can't help sense the sadness that lurks beneath. * I googled Fukudome to see where he is playing now, and had to smile ... the Hanshin Tigers. ...more How can I possibly put this book into my own words?

It is nothing ground shaking, nothing that makes you tumble and dive \u2013 but something that makes a certain small, but important part of you shift inside. It is on the surface a simple story about a friendship that grows in an unlikely place. I love these kinds of stories \u2013 in books or films, because though they are simple, they can mean a lot to you and touch you very deeply. It is told in first person and none of the characters are referred to by their names. Even the Housekeeper\u2019s son is given a name other then his own. The Professor is obsessed with maths \u2013 it is all he has left to him. The Housekeeper has to re-introduce herself to him every eighty minutes. They make a friendship through the connections between themselves and numbers. You do not have to know anything about maths to enjoy this book \u2013 although it did bring back some vague memories from maths lessons at school. I used to think maths as boring, and rather frustrating perhaps because I could never appreciate maths for itself. The Housekeeper herself is ignorant about maths, but when she met the Professor she expressed an interest and start to learn through the Professor. I loved this book \u2013 it touched me deeply and I\u2019m going to be hunting down more of Yoko Ogawa\u2019s books from now on. Hotel Iris is next on my list but unfortunately there is this thing called a book ban and I\u2019m on it until I can fit more books into my bookshelf. ...more This book is truly original, not your normal run of the mill.

It is about friendship and the beauty of numbers and baseball. And more..... Where should I start? I will start with the numbers. This is sort of the easiest to expalin. This book made me see and feel the beauty of math, of the laws that govern numbers. The world is so complicated. We understand nothing. Everything is always changing, but then you learn of a mathematical formula that is constant, that is always true, and suddenly there is an order to the messy world around us. The author goes even one step beyond this. Three people, of which two are completely normal like you and me, the housekeeper and her son, come to understand the magic of numbers through their contact with the Professor (of math). I wish I had had had a math teacher like te Professor! Did you know that zero is a concept thought up by an Indian mathematician. Before him the Greeks thought this concept didn't need a symbol. You get history, and then the author pulls the mathematical concept into the story so you understand the true consequence of the concept. What it means to you and me. Infinity, a line, zero, amicable numbers. Honestly, math is made beautiful. Occasionaly, I was too tired to follow the full development of a formula, but usually the author never pushed the theoretical underpinings too far. It is definitely worth reading the book just so that you will learn about math, but there is more! There is baseball. And there is true friendship. And there is a look at how people come to love each other simply by doing things together. Caring for each other. All the blurbs about this book tell you that the housekeeper is taking care of an elderly man who can only remember what has happened during the last 80 minutes. He can also remember everything before 1975, before a car accident. What does this lack if remembrance really mean? It means that every day when she and her son come to his door he doesn't know who they are. It means that when you spend a wonderful afternoon together, it is gone tomorrow. So are the frightful disagreements that can destroy a day. Gone - they never happened! What does this say to the reader? What's the lesson to be learned? You get a beautiful picture of a frail old man, who has three suits - one for winter, one for summer and one for the spring and fall. That is what he wears. He has little pieces of paper pinned all over his suit to remind himeslf of things he must remember. Soon he is not a man dressed in a suit, but a man dressed in fragments of paper. The image is beautiful and clear and wonderful. Why? Bcause you fall in love with the guy! What develops for realationship between these three people is extraordinary. Do you see why I say this book is original? It is NOT melodramatic, it is quiet and beautiful. Heartwarming - definitely. Read it. It's only 180 pages. Take time to read chapter 10, of the eleven chapters in the book, slowly. Savour it. It is so beautiful. 12 pages in and I already love the characters, the housekeeper and the professor! Why is that? Perhaps b/c they are each true to their own selves. They are not what society wants them to be but merely who they were born to be. I cannot help but compare this with the poor souls of Remarkable Creatures . Although both Elizabeth and Mary also followed their inclinations, they spent all their time judging themselves by the moral standards of their times. The housekeeper and the professor are too busy being themselves. ...more Audiobook performed by Cassandra Campbell. 5***** and a \u2764 A housekeeper is sent by her agency to the home of a problematic client.

A blue star is stamped on the client\u2019s card each time a housekeeper has to be replaced, and the Professor\u2019s card already has nine stars. But she prides herself on her professionalism. The Professor lives in a small cottage next to a larger mansion occupied by his brother\u2019s widow. A few years before he suffered a brain injury in an automobile accident and as a result his memory is limited to 80 minutes. His suit coat is covered in small notes to help him remember things he would otherwise forget. Each morning he asks the Housekeeper for her shoe size, her birth date and the age of her son, Root. Yet, despite having to introduce themselves anew each morning, they develop a unique friendship. I\u2019m not sure what I was expecting, but what I got was a beautifully elegant gem of a novel. The slow way in which the Housekeeper, Root and the Professor get to know one another is framed by his lessons on the poetry of mathematics. And it IS poetic the way he explains it. His love of the subject and the elegance of perfect equations is evident, as is his love of teaching. As limited as his memory is, the Professor\u2019s ability to find the beauty in numbers (and to share that sense of awe with his companions) seems without limit. I liked how Ogawa used the Professor\u2019s and Root\u2019s love of baseball to frame their growing friendship. And I liked the sensitivity Root showed when he refrained from correcting the Professor\u2019s assumption that the great Enatsu was still playing (rather than having actually retired more than a dozen years previously). Root taught the Professor to enjoy the game for the camaraderie and joy of watching the team and cheering them on, while the Professor taught Root the wonder of statistics and the beauty of the numbers involved. \u201dHis joy had little to do with the difficulty of the problem. Simple or hard, the pleasure was in sharing it with us.\u201d I could not help but remember my father and his great love for and natural ability with math. He taught me so many little tricks when I was a child and made solving problems fun. I\u2019m sure that is partly why I had such a positive emotional response to this book. Cassandra Campbell does a fine job narrating the audio book. She has a gentle quality that is perfectly suited to this book. There is a scene where the Professor praises the way in which the boy has read aloud a homework problem: \u201c You make a boring problem sound just like a poem.\u201d That is a perfect description for Campbell\u2019s performance; even when she is reading equations, she makes them sound like poetry.

But like all great literature, this novel caused something inside me to shift and change. The four characters in this tale are nameless, known only by their titles of Professor, Housekeeper, Sister-in-law, and Root, the housekeeper's 10 year old son, so nicknamed by the Professor because his flat head looks like the symbol for square root. These people form a family of sorts, bound by their love of the brain damaged professor, a math genius who lost his short term memory in an accident, but anything before 1975 is still intact, especially his love for and knowledge of numbers and their magic. One of the loveliest passages is when the professor wonders about the man who first discovered zero, and how it changed the concepts and properties of numbers. Root and the professor bond over their love of baseball, which the professor knew exactly how it was played because of his love of statistics, even though he had never even seen a game or heard one on the radio. There is so much to love about this book. I'll end by comparing it to \"Stoner\", a book that has formed a part of my psyche ever since I read it. These characters are in my head and heart, where they will remain for a good, long time. ...more This was such a charming and heart-warming read: there was so much beauty in the writing, on the surface simple yet at the same time filled with hidden meanings and complexities, just like the intricate lace the housekeeper imagines, with awe, that the mathematician professor is able to glimpse.

I liked how, in keeping with the professor having to be reintroduced to the housekeeper and her son throughout her special time with him, the reader too was kept in the dark about the names of the characters, so that the story felt more intimate, raw, fragile and secret. I can perfectly visualise the endearing figure of the professor in my mind. This book has given me a new appreciation for and fascination with mathematics, which, when I used to be forced to study it at school would make me cry with frustration and tear my hair out! Now, through the professor's own enchanting enthusiasm, I am able to get a sense of how calming and reassuring a definite formula can be, and how important in discovering the mesmerising secrets of our universe. ...more Some books stay with you.

It is simple, gentle and character-driven, and it is also moving because it has so much insight into the human condition. The Housekeeper is a single mother with a ten-year old son. She has a great deal of experience and she knows that she is good at her job, but when she is sent to work for The Professor, a virtuoso mathematician, she is worried. Why? Wel Some books stay with you. They make you pause, think and smile whenever they come into your mind. For me, this is definitely one of those books. It is simple, gentle and character-driven, and it is also moving because it has so much insight into the human condition. The Housekeeper is a single mother with a ten-year old son. She has a great deal of experience and she knows that she is good at her job, but when she is sent to work for The Professor, a virtuoso mathematician, she is worried. Why? Well the Professor has been through nine housekeepers before her. And after an accident seventeen years ago the Professor\u2019s short term memory lasts just eighty minutes. How do you live with something like that? Well, the Professor lives a quiet, solitary life. And he pins notes to his suit. To remind him of the limitations of his memory and the details of his life. Every morning the Professor meets The Housekeeper for the first time. Yet, a true friendship grows between them. The Professor infects both the Housekeeper and her son, who he nicknames Root, on account of his flat haircut\u2019s resemblance to a square root sign, with his deep love of the beauty of numbers and mathematics. And they bond over a shared love of baseball. I don\u2019t think it matters though is you don\u2019t love numbers or if you don\u2019t love baseball. I love the former but know absolutely nothing about the latter. What is important is the love that the Housekeeper, the Professor and Root have for them and the bond between them that that shared love helps to grow. But in time it is inevitable that change must come. The Housekeeper and the Professor is a quite lovely history of a friendship. Characters, themes and a gently developing plot are perfectly blended. The writing is clear and beautiful. What need to be said is said, but there is also space to realise and appreciate what is not said. The translator has clearly done a wonderful job. Much has been written about this book, and much more could and probably will be written. But I am moved less to write than to smile and remember happily as I think of The Housekeeper and The Professor. Definitely a book to cherish.

Nice short tale of a professor who was passionate of maths and has developed a memory problem in the later years of his life... The tale is effortlessly narrated by the housekeeper who observes the nuances of the everyday life with the professor. And Maths takes a whole new poetic form in this book...Well one take away from this book is that it has taught me what it means to truly live in the present...Nice read ! What a wonderful and touching story, loved the realness of the characters, and how they found a common ground in the love for a young boy. Baseball and mathematics play a large part but it also explores what friendship really means and the acceptance of people that are different. Wonderfully poignant story. \u0394\u03b5\u03bd \u03be\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 \u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03ad\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5 \u03b7 \u03c4\u03cd\u03c7\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9

moments: 1) your first impression of them (yes, it's that important), and 2) your most recent impression of them. All the times in-between may linger, but those two moments are the moments most responsible for your feelings. So what would it be like if each of those moments is created anew, every 80 minutes? How would you form an opinion of or attachment to someone? Woul I remember learning in my interpersonal communications class in college that your opinion of someone is mainly comprised of two moments: 1) your first impression of them (yes, it's that important), and 2) your most recent impression of them. All the times in-between may linger, but those two moments are the moments most responsible for your feelings. So what would it be like if each of those moments is created anew, every 80 minutes? How would you form an opinion of or attachment to someone? Would you ever? These questions and more are asked in Yoko Ogawa's The Housekeeper and the Professor . A housekeeper is hired to clean and cook for and generally watch after a brilliant mathematician whose short-term memory is on an 80-minute reset loop after being in a car accident. To the professor, it's still 1975, give or take 80 minutes. To counter this, he wears a suit pinned with assorted notes to jog his mind, the most important one of which says, \"My memory lasts 80 minutes.\" The housekeeper develops a fondness for the professor's brilliant mind for numbers, and for his affection for children - upon learning that the housekeeper has a son, the professor demands she bring him to the house after school, and nicknames him Root, for his flat head. Root gets math help from the professor, and soon they're bonding over their mutual love for baseball. The Housekeeper and the Professor isn't filled with huge drama, but with snippets of life - a baseball game, a doctor's visit, a birthday party, homework assignments, preparing dinner. We don't learn any of the character's names (Root is a nickname, and that's the only name we get), and it all mostly takes place within the professor's humble house, a guest cottage off of his sister-in-law's main home. It feels as though we as readers are peering in on their story through the windows, or through old photos or family films. Ogawa writes with a light grace, rendering a warmth and softness to the story that makes it feel like a memory itself. That tenderness is balanced with the exacting form of math and numbers - and yet, Ogawa and the professor bring mystery and intrigue to math in a way that I never thought possible. Math was always my worst subject in school - except in college, when I deliberately bombed some of the harder questions on the placement test so that I could take easy math - and I never had a teacher who I connected with, or who could make it interesting to my \"young writer\" self. Reading The Housekeeper and the Professor , I found myself actually wanting to know more about some of the terms and equations, which are all explained in layman's terms, almost as though the professor is teaching them to you directly instead of the housekeeper. I was even excited to hear that 28 is a perfect number (and to learn what that means) - since it's the date of my birthday. Ogawa doesn't spell everything out - some things are merely hinted at, but never fully answered, leaving us as readers to decipher them for ourselves, much like an equation. I like it better this way - like the Professor says about math, the best discoveries are made when you're blazing your own path. (view spoiler) [What's up with the picture of the Professor and the Sister-in-Law? Is she really his Sister-in-Law? Maybe she's actually his wife? Or maybe they had some kind of illicit, forbidden, romantic relationship? And why is the Professor so sensitive about children? It feels like there must be something to that, some hidden tragedy... (hide spoiler) ] As a unit, the Housekeeper, the Professor, and Root blaze their own way together, creating a mish-mashed family of sorts. The professor has only his sister-in-law, a distant figure in a house (or is she...), and the housekeeper and Root have only each other and the professor, with Root's dad long out of the picture, the housekeeper's mother having since passed on, and her own father MIA, as well. Like components in an equation, the three of them together form a fantastic result - the housekeeper and the professor caring for Root, Root and the housekeeper caring for the professor, the professor and Root and their shared love of baseball, and all three sharing a growing love for math. So what creates a relationship, a bond, a family, when shared experience is gone, or remembered only through a scribbled note pinned to a suit? Is it as simple as a shared interest in baseball and math? Or is it something more, something deeper, something that goes beyond the brain's capability? The Housekeeper and the Professor gives us a glimpse at what that might be. ...more Buddy Read with my lovely ragazza Cam \"For the professor, there was no shame in admitting you didn't have the answer, it was a necessary step toward the truth.

It was as important to teach us about the unknown or the unknowable as it was to teach us what had already been safely proven. There are books that shred you after you\u2019ve read them. Authors that feel like they\u2019ve written their books just for you. The House Keeper and The Professor is one of those books, and Yoko Ogawa is one of those authors. In the span of one month, I\u2019ve read every one of her English translations that I\u2019ve been able to get my hands on, and I\u2019m devastated that only three exist. I need more of this incredible author in my life. My French is rusty, but I\u2019m willing to dust it off so I can read more. Forget that, I\u2019d learn Japanese just to read the original. She is that worth it. I have to pick myself up of the floor to right this review. It did not make me cry. Oh No. It made me sob right into the arms of my 92 year old granny. I loved this one so much, that I will probably butcher this review, so if there is anything that you need to take away from this book it\u2019s this. It is Beautiful. The novel follows the life of the housekeeper's time working for the professor. None of the characters are given names aside from Root the housekeeper's son, but even so it's a nickname. They are simply the housekeeper, the Professor etc. The housekeeper is sent to her new assignment which turns out to be working for an aging former math professor. At first nothing is odd, just another person to look after, and another house to clean. However, the oddity of the professor is that his memory only last eighty minutes, so everyday she shows up to work he meets her for the first time. \u201cSoon after I began working for the Professor, I realized that he talked about numbers whenever he was unsure of what to say or do. Numbers were also his way of reaching out to the world. They were safe, a source of comfort.\u201d The professor breaths math. It's his passion, his language, the only thing that helps him make sense of the world, and of the people he meets but forgets everyday.The Housekeeper is patient and intrigued by the professor's mathematical abilities, and although they both come from different worlds, they grow to learn a lot from each other. Not long after she starts her job, the professor tells her to bring her ten year old son Root, and the three form a beautiful friendship. This story makes me think of purity. The purity of love and friendship. The ending is bittersweet, but perfect. I cannot recommend this highly enough. This is not only one of my favorite books of this year, but one of my favorites of all time. A truly lovely story, and a true work of beauty. This story will stay with me till I\u2019m an old lady, and my memory starts to fade. ...more The Professor is a brilliant mathematician who suffered some brain damage in an automobile accident years ago. He can remember his entire life up until the accident, but afterwards, he only has a memory of the past 80 minutes. Luckily, his sister-in-law steps in to help care for him.

He can remember his entire life up until the accident, but afterwards, he only has a memory of the past 80 minutes. Luckily, his sister-in-law steps in to help care for him. She hires housekeepers to come in to his little cottage and cook his meals. Needless to say, the Professor scares off many of these women. But then The Housekeeper comes along. She's something of a specialist in difficult cases. She is patient with the Professor and introduces herself to him every morning, respects the days when he is thinking, and generally wins him over again every day. This is an elegantly-written novel. There aren't any wasted words, but it is still beautifully written. Every word seems to be chosen with care. I can't say that a lot happens in the story itself. There's no big, romantic love, no adventure, no heartbreak. But the story is beautiful too. These are characters that I learned to care about. The Professor is overwhelmed by the world and seeks solace in his orderly numbers. He obviously has a huge heart. He adores the Housekeeper's son, and really all children in general. The Housekeeper is a single mom doing the best she can and finding the time to care for and about this slightly damaged man. They are both lonely and they find each other and they form their own unique kind of family. It's a beautiful story and I loved it. Quite a bit of the book revolves around mathematics. Don't let that put you off. The Housekeeper tells the story, and she is not a mathematician. None of that is overwhelming. I wouldn't change a thing about the book, but I do have to say that I am curious about the Professor's past. The Housekeeper finds an old photo that brings up a lot of unanswered questions. And I just get the feeling that there's some kind of tragedy that led to the Professor's intense concern for children's safety. I'm happy to leave my questions unanswered though. The Housekeeper and her son learn to care for the Professor just as he is, without any concern for his past, so it feels right that the past stays in the past. The translator, Stephen Snyder, obviously did an amazing job. This kind of writing is rare from authors who write in English. It takes a very talented team of author and translator to produce it in a translation. For a quiet, beautiful, feel-good book about friendship and families, pick this up. ...more This apparently modest little novel impressed me more than I had anticipated. A number of decades before the action begins, a brilliant Japanese mathematician suffered a devastating head injury in an automobile accident and cannot remember anything prior to 80 minutes before the present moment. A housekeeper, a young single mother, and her young son are hired to care for him daily. The fascinating and poignant narrative focuses on and explores issues of memory, number theory, and relationships. This apparently modest little novel impressed me more than I had anticipated.

In just 180 slim pages, Yoko Ogawa covers a lot of ground and she does it seamlessly: the nature of memory, the poetry of mathematics, the meaning of family and connections, the core of our profoundest relationships. Or, in a phrase: what it means to be human. There are only three main characters within these pages and none of them are named, suggesting the universal aspect of each.

In just 180 slim pages, Yoko Ogawa covers a lot of ground and she does it seamlessly: the nature of memory, the poetry of mathematics, the meaning of family and connections, the core of our profoundest relationships. Or, in a phrase: what it means to be human. There are only three main characters within these pages and none of them are named, suggesting the universal aspect of each. There is the Professor, a one-time prominent math teacher who cannot hold memories long due to an accident (his brain is like a tape, erasing itself every 80 minutes). There is the Housekeeper, a single mother who is his new cook and cleaner after many failed attempts with other housekeepers. And there is her 10-year-old son, called Root by the professor, because his flat head reminds him of the mathematical sign for a square root. Each morning, the Housekeeper must introduce herself \u2013 and later, her son \u2013 to the Professor all over again. He is likely to ask her shoe size or telephone number, as a means of connecting to her mathematically. For example, her birthday, February 20 (or 220) turns out to be \u201camicable\u201d with the number 284, engraved on his prize watch\u2026a way for him to assert a connection between them. Although he can\u2019t remember from one 80-minute sequence to the next, he remains as paternal, protective, and caring as before. In a fascinating dynamic, the Professor remains constant through most of the book; after all, he is only capable of living in the present. But the Housekeeper and her son also have a future, and through the Professor they learn and grow. The caring connections transcend the Professor\u2019s disability or his forced immersion in the present, making it a story about love in its deepest sense. A dominant subplot is the baseball game and the Professor (and Root\u2019s) love of the Tigers. The Professor, of course, is a fan of the OLD Tigers when Yutaka Enatsu ruled (he can retain nothing since his accident). And Root is looking toward the future of the Tigers, whom he hopes will win a pennant. Baseball \u2013 like mathematics \u2013 is rife with statistics and the laws of probability. For this math-challenged reader, Ms. Ogawa succeeds in making numbers exotic, alluring, and symbolic of ultimate truths. Just as prime numbers are distinctive, so is each individual. In the end, this is a book about discovery: the mother and son discover what matters in life and each other while the professor discovers them again and again, each time with delight. And through it all, the constant of mathematics and the crux of human nature remain. ...more One of my top 10 for 2015. If it weren't for my goodread friends I'd never know about this little gem! I bet 50 years from now it'll be a classic. It's not on 1001 books to read before you die, but it should be. A housekeeper accepts an assignment to care for a mathematics professor who can't remember more than 80 minutes at a time as a result of a car accident.

Would you be able to clean, cook, wash, etc around a man who 6 or 7 times a day re-introduces himself to you without going batty? As a cook, wouldn't you be tempted to give him the same meals over and over? I admit, I skimmed some of the math talk--it's been decades since I've heard of some of those terms. It's even more amazing that he was able to enter contests when he had to re-familiarize the proofs multiple times a day. The housekeeper (no names are ever given) was so patient. ...more When I say this book is twee, I don't say it as a general condemnation.

My recent and rapid falling in love with the animated TV show 'Steven Universe' is but another step in a long and unbroken cycle spanning back to the days of the animated 'Beauty and the Beast' that can be best described as an appreciation of quality twee. Miyazaki, Pixar, 'How to Train Your Dragon', stuffed animals, Pusheen, the upcoming Beauty and the Beast live action; all are examples of high quality revitalizing consumable media that I engage with as often, if not more so, as their drier, denser, and more diabolical cousins in the realms of literature, horror, and social justice. I learned a long time ago that I will never be able to do as so many other so-called adults do and cut off my feet to please the surrounding heads, so rather than even trying, I take what I can get and critically engage with all. The results: I prefer my twee to be sustaining, which more often than not means serious engagement with those much scoffed at 'morals', albeit in ways that are commonly marginalized by their more respected cousins aimed at older demographics. For example, if LGBTQ+ and mental health are some of your interests, 'Steven Universe' is an absolute must. In terms of my standards of quality twee, this work falls into the solid middle of things of a narrative with a minimum of engagement and lack of pushing of any buttons. Inherited lack of both nuclear family and legitimacy of progeny was interesting at the beginning, but quickly turned into a problem of patriarchy that the introduction of the Professor was intended to solve. The math was both nostalgic and fascinating, as I may be taking on a general tutoring position in the near future that will hearken back to my engineering days, but too many of its scenes had the feeling of reverse narrative construction wherein the story was tailored to solutions already found in the back of the book. I appreciated the housekeeper's appreciation of numbers, but would have liked to see some change in formula come about from the addition of new and fascinatingly strange variables, beyond her son taking the assumed mantel of young and upcoming male respectability. The weakest point was the baseball, but that was due to lack of interest on my part than anything else. My most recent memory of it involves leaving the stadium a half hour into the game and despairing over the fact that the bookstore I passed on my way back to the hotel was closed for the day, which should tell you something about my bias. Ultimately, I picked this up because I was in the mood for something short and sustaining. I got the short, but I could have used much more of the sustaining. Ogawa's The Diving Pool is also on my shelves, so I'm hoping when I come back in a creepier and more surrealistic mood, that will go along better. ...more", "Title": "The Housekeeper and the Professor"},
