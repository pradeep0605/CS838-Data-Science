I found <+++>The Golem and the Jinni</+++> to be a fun, magical fairy tale of a romance with a fair bit of excitement to it. But it is pretty clear that this is also a serious, literary work, raising meaningful philosophical questions, while using the folklore of two different cultures to inform the immigrant experience, offering a fascinating look at a place and time, and linking the experiences of the old and new worlds. These two takes seemed to call for different reviews. And, as I maintain only one identity on GR, the result is two, two, two reviews in one. REVIEW #1 Everyone loves legends, lore, tales of long ago, filled with heroes and magical beings. They dilate our pupils, excite our imagination and provide the fodder for our dreams. <---A>Helene Wecker</---A> has written a very grown up fairy tale, bringing to life a pair of magical beings. In doing so she has transported old world legend to a place where and a time when vast numbers of more ordinary people were trying to create new dreams, new legends of their own, immigrant New York City at end of the 19th century. The Golem is a clay creature constructed by a corrupt Kabalist near Danzig, at the behest of Otto Rotfeld, an unsuccessful, unattractive young man. But Rotfeld was not looking for a thuggish destroyer. He wanted his golem to be made in the form of a woman and imbued with curiosity, intelligence and a sense of propriety. On the passage to New York, Otto suffers a burst appendix and dies, but not before he speaks the words that bring his creation to life. Newborn and alone, but with an ability to perceive the wants of those around her, the Golem is set loose in New York. Wandering around, she is spotted for what she really is by a retired rabbi on the Lower East Side. He takes her in, tries to get her settled and struggles with how to deal with the fact that she is a creature usually built for the purpose of destruction. Not too far away, in Little Syria, an Arab immigrant community near the southern tip of Manhattan, Boutros Arbeely, a tinsmith, is brought an unusually old copper flask. While attempting to repair it, he is confronted by a magical being of his own, a handsome arrogant, and unclothed jinni. Unfortunately for the jinni, despite having been freed of the flask, he remains trapped in the shape of a human, bound there by an iron cuff on his wrist. In this telling jinnis, despite excelling at metalwork, have no power over iron. He will have to cope as a human.<---F> Each faces challenges</---F>. The Golem, named Chava (<---B>which means life</---B>) by the rabbi must cope with the flood of wishes that assail her consciousness from the thousands of people around her. She must learn to keep her identity secret. This includes coping with the fact that she does not sleep, and that it is not considered ok for a young woman to be seen walking the city streets at night, even if her purpose is honorable. Like many immigrants before her, she is helped by prior arrivals. She learns to bake and gets a job in a bakery. Unable to go out at night she takes in sewing. How immigrant is that? The jinni, taken in by the tinsmith, is given work in the shop, once it becomes apparent that he is a marvel with metal, able to heat and mold it with his bare hands. Boutros names him <---C>Ahmad</---C>. The jinni is also challenged to keep his true nature under cover. But a part of his nature is a lustful side. He is smitten with a young thing he encounters and one thing leads to another. Chava, while not much hot to trot herself, becomes an object of romantic interest to a very good young man. Of course, in time, the two encounter each other, and that is where the story takes off. Not only is there magic in the interaction of these two friends, strangers in a strange land, they bring depth to their relationship, adding even more depth to this novel. Chava has content-rich discussions with her rabbi rescuer, on matters such as why people risk so much to have sex, or whether people need a concept of God to keep them from self-destructing. She and Ahmad discuss the stresses of free will vs the certainty of slavery. They talk about her interest in satisfying the wishes of those around her while Ahmad is mostly concerned with satisfying his desires of a moment. A great part of the magic in this fable is how the two begin at extreme ends and meet somewhere in the middle, growing and changing, but very much aware of their limitations. The two embody, in a way, the immigrant experience. Coming to a new country, learning new ways, changing in order to fit in, coming to value what has been found, building a life. But character growth, consideration of serious moral subjects and a moving relationship are not all that this book has going on. There is danger afoot. Keeping the action moving, we get not only a look into the jinni\u2019s ancient past, a fascinating and moving segment, but there is pursuit on those cobble-stoned streets. A person with evil intent is tracking the scent of magic and surviving this onslaught is the motive force. As we have come to care about both our primary characters their safety matters. Not only has Wecker populated her fable with two wonderful leads, but her backup players are extremely rich. In fact this is one of the best supporting casts I have seen in a while. The Golem and the Jinni has love, parental and romantic, philosophical heft, a vibrant picture of a place and time, the equivalent of an action/adventure trial-by-danger and enough magic to shake a wand at. In short it is everything in a book that you could possibly wish for. REVIEW #2 It may not take you a thousand and one nights to read The Golem and the Jinni , but you may wish it did because you will hate to put it down. It is 1899. In a town near Danzig, Otto Rotfeld is a failing Prussian Jewish businessman. He does not have much success with the ladies either. A leering and dismissive manner will do that. Determined to change his luck he opts to join the throng heading to that new Mecca, the USA. Figuring the female sorts there will find him as appealing as did those of the Old World, he decides to take matters into his own hands. Well, rather into the hands of a morally challenged Kabalist who is ok with crafting what Otto wants, a bespoke Golem, using the traditional clay, but made in the shape of a woman, and not the sort of towering, lumbering, bad-hair destroyer that usually pops to mind, thanks to early German cinema. Or a more 20th century version Gotta confess, I kept seeing Amanda Righetti of The Mentalist in the role as I read. Hey, the guy's got needs. (This raises the wonderful theoretical possibility of a high-end retail business, Build-a-Golem. Schmul, more clay, hurry up.) Unwell in his steerage accommodation, Otto is looking for a little companionship and wakes his special friend. Just in time, as it turns out, as Otto, and his burst appendix, fail to make it to the particular new world he was hoping to reach. This leaves a rather bewildered, powerful and telepathic mythical creature heading for Ellis Island. She finds an unusual way to cope when asked for her papers, which I will not spoil, then, wandering around the city, is taken in by a retired rabbi who sees her for what she really is. (Yeah, he\u2019s a lot older, but he really sees me) The Golem truly is a stranger in a strange land, but she is not the only oddity on shore. In Little Syria, an immigrant community near the southern tip of Manhattan, a Maronite Catholic tinsmith, Boutros Arbeely, is brought a copper flask to repair. While beginning work on the piece with a soldering iron (no rubbing of the magic container this time) he is blasted across the room, and before you can say Robin Williams three times fast, there on his shop floor is a naked man. And it\u2019s not even Halloween in the Village. Really, he is a creature made of fire and mist, but is confined by virtue of an iron bracelet into the form of a human. In this imagining, iron is something a jinni can\u2019t do anything with, I guess like bad fashion sense. Sorry, no puff of smoke. But this magic man is a hottie. He is, of course, cut and handsome, but in addition, he is a natural metalworker. Boutros, despite the jinni\u2019s arrogance, gives him a place to live and a job. He ain\u2019t never had a friend like him . I see in my tiny mind the steamy Colin O'Donoghue (currently Captain Hook on Once Upon a Time) Ya think these two illegal immigrants might cross paths? Duh-uh. But it will take some time, as each has his and her own road to travel. If I had three wishes the first would be to be able to write as well as Helene Wecker. She manages to combine several layers to make a compelling whole. She compares a bit of folklore from two different cultures and looks at how they work in a new place. She offers philosophical consideration of deep human issues. She offers a wonderful view of a place and a time, and there is a motive force here that keeps the story moving, and presents our two leads with a mortal threat. On one level this tale is a bit of a romance. Boy meets Gol. (permission to groan) Well, not exactly a boy, but a mythical fire being who was 200 years old when a wizard confined him, maybe 600 years prior to the now of the story. And this clay hulk is not just a soul-less destroyer, but has a definite tender side. I was reminded of Mary Shelley\u2019s creation, the novel\u2019s version, really trying to figure out his, or in this case, her place in the world, struggling to work out her relationship to god and to morality, and to the people around her. I could not help but think back to my Catholic school days and the Q and A of the Baltimore Catechism. Q \u2013 Why did God make you? A \u2013 God made me to know Him, to love Him and to serve Him\u2026 Sounds a little creepy in this context, doesn\u2019t it? As a creature built to be a slave, but lacking a master, the golem must become her own master in a way, (a Ronin?) accepting guidance for sure, but facing real existential dilemmas. What happens when the guy in charge is no longer around? She engages in a discussion with the jinni about the messiness of free will versus the certainty of slavery to the will of another, raising up issues not only of actual slavery, but of blind allegiance, whether to a military cause, a political party, a religious persuasion. When is a person responsible for his or her actions and when does responsibility lie elsewhere? (I am including that discussion here, but am using the spoiler label to separate it from the body of the review. It is not really spoiler material.) (view spoiler) [\u201cIf, by some chance or magic you could have your master back again, would you wish it?\u201d It was an obvious question, but one that she had never quite asked herself. She\u2019d barely known Rotfeld, even to know what sort of a man he was. But then, couldn\u2019t she guess? What sort of man would take a golem for a wife, the way a deliveryman might purchase a new cart? But oh, to be returned to that certainty! The memory of it rose up, sharp and beguiling. And she wouldn\u2019t feel as though she was being used. One choice, one decision\u2014and then, nothing. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said at last. \u201cMaybe I would. Though in a way, I think it would be like dying. But perhaps it would be for the best. I make so many mistakes on my own.\u201d \u2026\u201dI have no idea,\u201d he said, \u201chow long I was that man\u2019s servant. His slave . I don\u2019t know what he may have forced me to do. I might have done terrible things. Perhaps I killed for him. I might have killed my own kind\u201d there was a tight edge in his voice, painful to hear. \u201cBut even worse would be if I did it all gladly . If he robbed me of my will, and turned me against myself. Given a choice, I\u2019d sooner extinguish myself in the ocean.\u201d \u201cBut if all those terrible things did happen, then it was the wizard\u2019s fault not yours,\u201d she said. Again, that not quite laugh. \u201cDo you have colleagues at this bakery where you work?\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d she said.\u201d ...He said. \u201cImagine that your precious master returns to you, and you give yourself to him, as you say perhaps you would. Because you make so many mistakes . And he said, \u2018Please, my dear golem, kill those good people at the bakery...Rip them limb from limb.\u201d \u201cBut, why\u2014\u201c \u201cOh, for whatever reason! They insult him, or make threats against him, or he simply develops a whim. Imagine it. And then tell me what comfort it gives to think it wasn\u2019t your own fault.\u201d This was a possibility she had never considered. And now she couldn\u2019t help but picture it: grabbing Moe Radzin by the wrist and pulling until his arm came free. She had the strength. She could do it. And all the while, that peace and certainty. No , she thought\u2014but now, having started down this path, her mind refused to stop. What if Rotfeld had made it safely to America with her, and the Rabbi had noticed them on the street one day? In her mind, the Rabbi confronted Rotfeld\u2014and then she was dragging the Rabbi into an alley, and choking the life from him. It made her want to cry out. She put the heels of her hands to her eyes, to push the images away. \u201cNow do you understand?\u201d the jinni asked (hide spoiler) ] The Golem has content-rich discussions with her rabbi rescuer, on matters such as why people risk so much to have sex, or whether people need a concept of God to keep them from self-destructing. She and Ahmad talk about her interest in satisfying the wishes of those around her while Ahmad is mostly concerned with satisfying his desires of a moment. A great part of the magic in this fable is how the two begin at extreme ends and meet somewhere in the middle, growing and changing, but very much aware of their limitations. The jinni, while he may still have a trick or two up his sleeves (yes, Boutros does cover him up), chief among which is the ability to mold metal with his bare hands, is still stuck in a human body and is forced to cope as a human. The Golem, whom the kindly rabbi names Chava, which means life, of course, must constantly struggle to hide her real identity. She struggles as well to control her impulses, in a way, like Shelley\u2019s creature, a child attempting to grow up. And she does pretty well, whether restraining herself from satisfying the flood of mental wants and needs that her telepathy picks up, or the occasional urge to pound some a-hole into bits. She is not the most outgoing sort, and is seen by many as a stick in the mud at times. So, are these two crazy kids gonna get together or what? Yeah, yeah, we\u2019ll get to that. Different paths, remember? The jinni happens to be hanging at the Bethesda Fountain in Central Park when his attention alights on a young thing of a late-teen socialite, Sophia, kept on a leash (or is it in a lamp?) by her mother. Her entire life is planned out for her. Someone follows her home and things heat up. Chava is not a slave to carnal whims, she may or may not even have carnal whims. But the rabbi has a mensch of a nephew, Michael. Sadly fallen from The Chosen, but a very nice young man who runs a hostel for new immigrants. Such a nice boy. You could do worse, Chavelah. So, you may wonder, do jinnis or golems sleep? I\u2019ll tell you. No. While not much for snoozing, the jinni has the ability to insert himself (what did I tell you about that? Stop it) into people\u2019s dreams. At least in this story it is only into the dreams of females. Sorry, boys. I imagine that when she was writing these sections, Wecker had to struggle to keep images of Barbara Eden from inserting themselves into her consciousness and giggling until she choked. What to do with those long nights? Walking of course. Well, for Mister Ahmad, anyway. It was not considered proper in that era for a young lady to be seen walking the streets alone late at night. It creates the wrong impression, and attracts the interest of unsavory sorts, like the police. As an illegal, and a non-human, that would not do. So Chava does what any young, energetic young lady in the turn of the century Lower East Side would do. Stop that, no, not that. She takes in sewing. Jeez. In fact there is a lot in this book about the immigrant experience, legal and not, at the end of the 19th century. Two communities both nurture their new arrivals, struggle to get by, to make a better life, attempting to leave behind some of the problems of the Old World. The two embody, in a way, the immigrant experience. Coming to a new country, learning new ways, changing in order to fit in, coming to value what has been found, building a life. Receiving new names. Free will permeates as a theme. A young New York socialite feels as imprisoned by the future that has been laid out for her as the golem does by her subservience to magical commands, as the jinni does to the metal cuff that denies him his true form, and as another young Bedouin lass feels back in the Old country. You will want to keep in mind notions of imprisonment and the difference between sand castles and other sorts, belonging, community, and note the odd angel motif. But character growth, consideration of serious moral subjects and a moving relationship are not all that this book has going on. There is danger afoot. Keeping the action moving, we get not only a look into the jinni\u2019s ancient past, a fascinating and moving segment, but there is pursuit on those cobble-stoned streets. A person with evil intent is tracking the scent of magic. Surviving this onslaught is the motive force. As we have come to care about both our primary characters their peril matters. Not only has Wecker populated her fable with two wonderful leads, but her backup players are extremely rich. In fact this is one of the best supporting casts I have seen in a while. You will not need to endanger your community through the use of dark magic or possess a magic vessel to find your next great read. The Golem and the Jinni will be available far beyond the shtetls of Europe, the deserts of the Middle East, and the New York City limits. This modern Sheherezade has written a magical book and there is no rub. The Golem and the Jinni is all that you could possibly wish for. =========================== EXTRA STUFF 3/31/13 - I found a group of interview clips with the author, from Library Love Fest.

Unsure what to think as I finally took the plunge into this 19th-Century New York tale of friendship, different cultures and, of course, magic, I found myself completely transported to another world. I understand why readers often call The Golem and the Jinni \"fantasy\" - it certainly has the depth, epic scope and density of a fantasy novel, and yet, I'm more inclined to call it a combination of historical fiction and magical realism. But, whatever the genre, it's a beautifully-written story of finding one's place in a strange world, all wrapped up with a fascinating combination of Jewish and Arabian folklore . The story follows two characters. Chava - a golem, created by dark magics paid for by her master, who longed for a wife. When her master dies on the Atlantic crossing from Europe to New York, Chava must navigate this new world alone, hide who she is, and figure out both how to live, and just exactly what she wants from life. The other character is a Jinni called Ahmad. He lived in the Syrian desert until he was trapped in a flask by a wizard. Over a thousand years later, he emerges in New York when a tinsmith releases him from his prison. With the tinsmith's help and kindness, he too must figure out this new, strange world and find a place in it. Though from very different backgrounds and cultures, these two foreigners' paths are destined to cross. United by their shared statuses as outsiders, a strange friendship develops, and they try to adjust to 19th Century New York City together. It's a very whimsical, magical book, filled with delicious description (sometimes quite literally, as Chava works in a bakery). The plot and writing are dense, occasionally becoming overlong in certain parts, but not so much that I minded. It has a truly magical opening that draws you in, as well as two interesting main characters - which more than makes up for the slight drag of some chapters. Sometimes, it is just so fascinating to be these two outsiders looking in at humanity. It is, at its most basic level, a tale of immigrants adjusting to a new land, but we also have the additional factor of it being two supernatural beings adjusting to humanity. Questions are raised about the human need for religion, free will vs. slavery, and why humans will sacrifice so much for sexual desire. It is simultaneously a look at 19th century American culture through the eyes of foreign immigrants, and a look at humanity through the eyes of foreign beings. Both clever and magical.

Not only because it is, but also because Helene Wecker's debut novel is a hard book to put into words, full of wonder and meaning, and an experience I don't think any review can fully do justice to. Still, even though I'll probably miss things, here goes... Chava is a golem. Ahmad is a jinni. This is not a story of their chance encounter and subsequent whirlwind romance among century ago Just this once, I wish I could say ' The Golem and the Jinni is awesome. Trust me.' and just leave it at that. Not only because it is, but also because Helene Wecker's debut novel is a hard book to put into words, full of wonder and meaning, and an experience I don't think any review can fully do justice to. Still, even though I'll probably miss things, here goes... Chava is a golem. Ahmad is a jinni. This is not a story of their chance encounter and subsequent whirlwind romance among century ago New York's immigrant community. No, this is one of those books. The ones that ponder the meaning of life and examine what it means to be human, to have free will and faith and hope, using the eyes of the least human among us to do so. It's a mix of historical fiction and Gilded Age myth, Jewish mysticism and Arab folklore, combining elements of Frankenstein and Aladdin in a seamless narrative that's both timeless and modern, insightful yet moving. I'll admit, I didn't think The Golem and the Jinni would be that book when I first started. Helene Wecker\u2019s writing style leans more toward fairy tale than historical, almost as if there\u2019s a surreal quality that makes her book difficult to place in its nineteenth century setting early on, but, as I would later realize, also lends an idealistic, romantic air to a city and a story that very well needed it. It's fantastical when the story needed to feel exotic, restrained when the tone had to be subdued, but always personal and touching. That said, sadly the first chapter is probably also the weakest, explaining Chava\u2019s origins in that no nonsense, fairy tale way that leaves very little to the imagination, compounded by a story that's slow, very slow, if affectionately crafted. Yet, as the narrative unfolds, as Chava loses her \u2018husband\u2019 to appendicitis and finds herself, alone and masterless, in the urban jungle that is New York City even then, it\u2019s obvious that Wecker quickly turns those weaknesses into elements of strength. Chava, desperately trying to pass as human for her own survival, is taken in by the elderly Rabbi Meyer, and although he\u2019s not unkindly towards the golem, the uncertainty, both for him and for her, of whether she can go against her violent nature hangs in the air. And it\u2019s Chava, created to serve the needs of humans yet trying to understand how to behave like one, who forms half the story. There are deep, profound moments about private thoughts and human nature, and whimsical moments with Chava testing the limits of her body, even eating food and trying to figure out where it goes, and the entire effect is that this wonderfully complex, incredibly compelling character slowly emerges, trying to pass for human out of necessity, yes, but also showing what it means to be one, maybe even a bit about the meaning of existence itself. Needless to say, I celebrated her triumphs, felt for her losses, understood her apprehensions, and hoped for her survival, all as she\u2019s trying to find her way in the world. The other half of the story is Ahmad, a creature very different from, potentially even the opposite, of Chava. Chava is of the earth; Ahmad is a being of fire. Chava is days old, innocent to the world; Ahmad is centuries old, jaded by his imprisonment. Chava doesn\u2019t understand what it means to be human; Ahmad has the wrong ideas. Yet even before they meet, Wecker has created the perfect foil for the golem, a jinni who\u2019s not less than human, but more , someone as wild and eternal as the desert air bound by flesh and blood, now a fraction of who he was. In contrast to the golem\u2019s uncertainty, his is a restless anxiety that chafes at the limits of human freedom, yet I felt his despair at the constraints of humanity as much as I felt Chava\u2019s fear of the limitlessness of humanity. And in a way, their intertwining stories form a reminder, I think, to the rest of us that, like Chava and Ahmad, we\u2019re all trying to find ourselves between these two extremes. Lest I forget, there is actually a plot. Chava and Ahmad don\u2019t spend the entire book wandering the streets of New York, discussing the human condition while forming the unlikeliest of friendships, even if I guess my review does give that impression. Sure, a lot of it is about fitting in, being human, some of it a celebration of the immigrant experience through culture, faith, community, even the hope of Lady Liberty followed by the realities of working class New York, but connecting Chava and Ahmad\u2019s story is also one Yehudah Schaalman, evil Kabbalist. The suspense of Schaalman\u2019s machinations adds a bit of urgency to a story that otherwise really doesn\u2019t have any, well beyond flashbacks from Ahmad\u2019s point of view slowly revealing his past while forming parallels with his present, but it\u2019s Schaalman, mostly in the background, ominous and foreboding, who brings Chava and Ahmad\u2019s story ultimately to its conclusion. I\u2019m not entirely satisfied with the (somewhat rushed) ending, particularly with Sophia Winston\u2019s role (though I do see how it mirrors Fadwa\u2019s, a character from Ahmad\u2019s past) and I feel Schaalman as the villain is a weaker aspect of the book than the exploration of human nature, but the epilogue ends on such a bittersweet yet hopeful note I still deeply respect what Helene Wecker has done. In a word, The Golem and the Jinni is a masterful look at the meaning of life through the eyes of two supernatural beings living in nineteenth century New York. Just by their everyday attempts to understand themselves, Chava and Ahmad, their story, says a lot about all of us. ...more This is one of my favorite books of the year.

I've never felt this hypnotized, amazed, and captivated; the level of mesmerization is just so up there that after reading this book, I doubt I can find any more that would be able to set the bar even higher. Be careful, books! Thanks to The Golem and the Jinni , you'll be finding yourselves continuously compared to this stunning, hard-to-beat literary masterpiece. A book that encompasses vast lands and centuries of loneliness and solitude, it is told in the perspectives of a dynamic cast of characters, with their own stories to tell, fears to hide, and desires to pursue, but it is told mainly in the eyes of Chava, a golem that was made to follow a master but unfortunately found herself having no one to guide her, and Ahmad, a jinni, who in a malicious twist of fate and unwanted circumstances, was trapped by a wizard hundreds of years past and now tied to a world he does not know. Two individuals with contrasting natures stuck in an environment they do not fully understand, I found them to be the book's strongest points, as their innocence and rashness were very endearing to read; every time they would wonder about human society \u2014 why do we have religion? Why do we hold out our desires and say what we deem is socially appropriate? Why is there a need for marriage and all sorts of rituals? \u2014 I end up pausing for a few minutes wondering about it, too, and the fact that it's being pondered on by an outside perspective, a magical being not of our nature, made it all the more thought-provoking. What's the meaning of life? What does it mean to really live? Are we really living or merely existing? Are we content with the monotony and constant routine of our daily lives, when we are capable of doing so much more? I loved how the book asked all these questions about human life and ethics from the point of view of a magical being, a creature not human, but more human than many of us. Couple that with the beautiful narrative, it just makes the experience all the more bewitching and engaging. Wecker has this unique and spectacular way of making things so familiar to us \u2014 the buzzing of the city, the chattering of neighbors, the baking of bread, and everything else \u2014 become so big, and new, and exciting. The book does take on a slow pace. A lot of things and activities that we usually find mundane and boring were described constantly, but Wecker, being the awesome writer that she is, gave the book an atmosphere that was magical and surreal at the same time that these activities just became a part of the book's charm. The writing is just so beautiful, the prose sublime, the descriptions enchanting, that you just fall in love with all of its aspects. I'm sure some of you are probably thinking I'm giving it way too much credit, but I shit you not when I say that the author's writing prowess is the best I've ever encountered. The plot is very slow. It unfolds itself in a snail-like pace, making you know the characters first, their place in the grander scheme of things, and their role in the overall story, revealing itself little by little in the background. It has a really interesting storyline that spans centuries of years to the present, a tale of maliciousness, consequences, revenge, and love. Because I believed the characters were the strongest points of the book, I thought the storyline, while good, was only secondary, but it was still very enjoyable and suspenseful nonetheless (especially when you have a creepy old man stalking you on his quest to find the key to immortality!). It has a very satisfying ending, with a romance that steadily gained momentum in the end, giving me a giddy, sheepish smile and a warm feeling tingling in my spine as I turned the last page, knowing deep in my heart that the two magical beings will find closure and happiness in the physical world. All in all, these are what I have to say: engaging story, check; nicely thought-out three-dimensional well-rounded characters, check; beautiful writing, check; surreal, magical atmosphere giving the book an overall romantic air, check; wonderful world-building, check! This is a stunning debut, a book that deserves a place in all our shelves, because it's that good. You cannot miss this one out, folks! Final verdict: 5 STARS!!! ...more I'm really quite amazed at the things this novel does right.

The length of the novel and beautiful prose also has a lot to do with it, as well. It's basically an immigrant story that becomes an empowerment story with a strong thread of very understated romance. The large set of characters never overwhelms the main two. The woman of Earth and the man of Fire are both magical creatures that find their way at the turn of the last century's New York City. It's really quite delightful. She was created out of clay and designed with intelligence and curiosity, but she was also designed to be subservient and modest... with an evil strain built in to all golems that make them wish to utterly destroy their creators once they get a taste for blood. He was a wild spirit of fire before he was enslaved and was forced to live in stasis for a thousand years until luck would have him freed... and at loose ends in cold winters that he is unable to escape from. How beautiful is that? It sounds like the setup for a grand romance. But it isn't. Not really. Theirs is a relationship based on trust and deep friendship, and even when that trust is broken, they forgive and return to each other. There's even an evil wizard that returns through each life with not just a complicated background but also a complicated inner life. I can't quite call him irredeemable. He does good and and makes beauty. He made the golem, after all. But his nature leads him down very dark pathways, too. So was this a character novel or a plot-driven one? Both. And wonderfully so. I got engrossed in everything. The journey was a pure delight. :) I totally recommend for anyone who wants a classy and gorgeous historical romance full of deep magic and iconic archetypal characters that are beautifully drawn. :) ...more This is a truly difficult book to rate, mostly because what faults I can find, I find them in myself as a reader.

Ahmad was trapped in a bottle for over a thousand years by a wizard, and imagine his surprise to find himself in an unheard of continent, when a tinsmith repairing his bottle awakes him from his sleep. The plot goes on its expected turns, both Chava and Ahmad, similar but so different, go about their lives trying to learn what it is to be human, so they can mask what they truly are. I have no complaints about the story. I really, really liked it. It kept me reading. There was no point where I went, \"I'll take a break from this\". I genuinely liked the characters, they were flawed, and yes, they annoyed me often, but that was part of their charm. So why am I only giving this 3.5 stars instead of 5? Because I'm a dreadful, greedy reader. It's true. It just felt... jarring to have whole chapters about a jinn in a glass and gold filigree palace in the desert, hiding so he can listen to the talks of the men in the caravans, stowing away into human dreams... Or chapters of a golem marvelling at human idiosyncrasies, feeling the call of fresh green growing things... and none of it be poetic at all. Not even remotely beautiful now and then. The language was always so straight-forward! Granted, there is nothing wrong with that, if I go through it, there is nothing wrong I can point about it, it's good, it's practical. It's... not what I wanted. I've read this whole book and I couldn't find a single quote from it I'd want to share with someone. Oh, I'd recommend the book, but there was nothing in it that just sparked, that made me go, \"Oh, that was beautiful.\" It is a very entertaining story, but it never feels like storytelling, there is never a sense of wonder reading it, and that's saying something when the two main characters are creatures of myth! As always, give it a try. It's good! I can tell it's good. It just isn't for me... ...more A wonderful tale I hated to put down, couldn\u2019t wait to resume whenever I did, and felt sad when it was over. A great blend of fantasy and historical fiction that explores what it means to be human amid the multicultural blend of immigrants trying to achieve their dreams in New York City at the end of the 19th century.

A great blend of fantasy and historical fiction that explores what it means to be human amid the multicultural blend of immigrants trying to achieve their dreams in New York City at the end of the 19th century. We follow the lives of two mythic creatures trying to pass as human, living parallel lives and slowly drawn into a common path. Chava appears as a woman and was recently made as a Golem from clay by a Jewish wizard to be the wife/slave of a Prussian, whose death on the ship from Europe leavers her masterless. She was made to be obedient, intelligent, curious, and faithful, with an ability to read and urge to serve people\u2019s needs, and the strength of six men. The Jinni (\u201cGenie\u201d) is creature with the essence of fire and the powers to assume many forms and to enter people\u2019s dreams and in some senses \u201cpossess\u201d them. Released by accident from an ancient flask by a tinsmith in the Little Syria part of the city, Ahmad has no memory how he got there and is trapped in human form by the magic of an iron bracelet. For many I am sure this scenario sounds pretty silly. But Wecker\u2019s brilliant storytelling quickly engages you with complete empathy in the fate of these two characters. Like other immigrants they have to figure out how to survive through regular jobs and to make friends in this society. Discovery and violent response to them as monsters is a big danger. For Chava, a special risk lies in going amok in defense of threats to herself or her friends. For Ahmad, his propensity toward seducing young women gets him in trouble a lot. For both, the biggest threat comes in the form of Chava\u2019s powerful creator, who comes to America caring only about finding the secret of eternal life. That neither Chava or Ahmad sleeps drives them to walk a lot at night, which is how they discover each other and become friends. Their clandestine explorations of the wonders of the city is a particularly captivating part of the story. Washington Square Park, a favorite spot for our characters Mulberry Street There are elements of parable and allegory in the plot, and frequent dwelling of the characters on free will and fate and on creation and death. But these aspects don't burden the story. Instead, it feels more like the delightful sleight-of-hand approach of Isaac B. Singer than the more heavy handed, self-conscious creations of Coehlo. I also appreciated the restraint in not portraying marvels as confections of imagination, i.e. that sense of cotton candy I got from \u201cThe Night Circus.\u201d The only reason I don\u2019t render 5 stars for this supremely fun ride is that it didn\u2019t quite make me laugh or cry. Also, despite writing that that carried the story well, no passage stimulated me to write it down as a condensation of a special truth.

It's because it catched it before you. All the times you felt swept off your feet? Here you have the thief of your balance. All the times you were so engrossed and lost and caught up in this story that you could not think, could not even remember your name? Yes. Its fault. \u2022Rarely have I encountered a more mesmerising , beguiling story . And it is not about the plot ; the role the plot has in all this is but minimal. It is about perception , about the atmosphere , about all those little things that are only hinted, implied, unspoken, and that yet form the truest framework of any story worth its salt. If you are planning to read this book, please do so as I did: in the dark. Don't spoil yourself the littlest detail, not even the characters' names. I promise the journey will be a thousand times more impressive and astounding . \u2022The characters are each one of them more compelling and developed than the other. No room left for clich\u00e9s nor banalities. Each one of them has his own motives , which makes them all the more believable and relatable , and each one of them is so skillfully fleshed-out it was as if all they needed to come to life was me to blow on the page to let them out. Moreover, the way their lives become more and more intertwined as the story goes on reminded me of a choral novel, even though the number of characters is not nearly as high. But I adore choral novels, and for this reason I soaked up the magnificence of this book twice as gladly. \"All of us are lonely at some point or another, no matter how many people surround us. And then, we meet someone who seems to understand.\" \u2022The themes : this book deals with many issues, primarly concerning diversity and ethnic differences . And I am not able to exactly put my finger on why it happened, but it won me over. The author managed this topic in such a professional and honest and sensible way that I was defenseless. This is how you craft a fabulous background for a fabulous story. \u2022What is more, this is one of those cases in which the writing perfectly complements the story. The style is neat , clean , pure . The only word that comes to my mind is perfection. Sheer perfection. \u27bd Basically, there is nothing in this book that I did not adore to pieces . I am sorry if my total lack of complaints (knowing me, complaints are probably what you would expect; I know, it's sad) sounds too good to be true, but trust me, please, trust me: this book is a jewel . I recommend it to everyone and anyone, wholeheartedly, no regrets whatsoever. Read it. Buy it and read it. And don't do it for me, do it for you . The world, later, will taste different . ...more Huh. Well, this was deeply... okay. Wecker set up an interesting and fairly straightforward concept: Two supernatural beings in the turn of the century New York, trying to make their way in the New World, an exaggerated metaphor for the immigrant experience and the human condition. Fair enough. And there was some lovely atmospheric writing at the start that both helped to build the historical world and the supernatural feeling while she built her world and info-dumped all the information we need Huh.

Fair enough. And there was some lovely atmospheric writing at the start that both helped to build the historical world and the supernatural feeling while she built her world and info-dumped all the information we needed to know about the characters. It took a bit too long and there was some rushed telling rather than showing just to get through to the actual story part, but I largely didn't mind. The backstories were interesting enough. I also quite enjoyed the jinni's initial adventures in New York, the people he meets and especially his relationship with Sophia. His attitude towards his existence was quite sympathetic and I couldn't wait to see what he would do next. The Golem's situation aroused my pity and I liked some of the parallels to women's situations that were drawn as well as the immigrant experience. Her (view spoiler) [ ability to read men's minds and anticipate what they want was a great indictment of the expectations of wives at the time. (hide spoiler) ] Eventually the two characters meet- which just seems inevitable. I enjoyed their first explorations and walks with each other. However, then the book seemed to feel some obligation to fall into the structure and expectations of a romance novel. The man is infuriating, the lady isn't even that attractive so why do I like her so much, they piss each other off and fight but have such a strong bond! I lost interest in the book when what happened. I thought Wecker had many more interesting things going on in the book than she gave herself credit for if she thought that that was the best thing to capture her readers' interest. I would rather have spent more time with Sophia, or had a romance between the jinni and Sophia continue if we really needed to go the romance route. I would rather have seen what the Golem would have done truly on her own with no master to speak of- fighting her conditioning (like a lot of women had to do then) to be truly independent. I wanted to see the jinni go out west and explore the world- yes he is long lived, but finite- so he could have had a really long bucket list we could have explored a little. I would have even accepted them as a buddy comedy type thing on a permanent road trip. But why oh why did we need the romance formula? The book flattened out and became predictable and lost so many possibilities when that happened. A side note: The musings on human condition through the supernatural being discovering how to be human/having it explained to them is a pretty well-worn device. So some of the \"realizations\" also needed to be a little less cliched and clunky. I would much rather have seen the Golem find herself in situations she had to work out rather than sitting down and \"thinking\" through the parellels the author wanted to tell me about. But it was still okay. I still like the ideas. I still liked the beginning. There were some interesting secondary characters. Just took the Road More Traveled in the end, which took this from \"solid\" to \"meh\". ...more Despite the obvious suggestion from the title and despite the supernatural nature of the main characters, for me this is not a novel about a golem and a jinni. It is the story of two ordinary people, immigrants like millions others coming to New York in the year 1899, there to learn how to deal with being uprooted from their birth lands, with being alone and lost in an alien culture, with how to slowly emerge from their hard protective shells and how to rely on each other. Maybe even to learn ho Despite the obvious suggestion from the title and despite the supernatural nature of the main characters, for me this is not a novel about a golem and a jinni. It is the story of two ordinary people, immigrants like millions others coming to New York in the year 1899, there to learn how to deal with being uprooted from their birth lands, with being alone and lost in an alien culture, with how to slowly emerge from their hard protective shells and how to rely on each other. Maybe even to learn how to fall in love with each other in a circumspect, tentative manner. Then again, the two immigrants are special people: a golem and a jinni emerging right out of the clay or the magic lamp all fairytales taught us to expect. Their background stories include all the paraphernalia of traits and supernatural powers and ethnic inheritance of their original cultures. So strong was the characterization and their individuality though, that for me they read like real people rather than impossible creatures from a fantasy realm. Chava and Ahmed are the new names they receive on arrival in the New World, gifts from benefactors who fortuitously come to ease the cultural shock of suddenly losing all the roots to the old home lands. For Chava, the angel of mercy is an elderly rabbi from the Jewish Quarter, for Ahmad a metalworker in the Little Syria neighborhood. The first reaction of the two outsiders is to hide, to remain unnoticed, to blend into the background and to avoid using their special talents lest some angry mob turns against them in a repetition of past pogroms against their kind. The novel can be interpreted then as the account of their shedding of the ingrained fear, coming out of the shell and beginning to explore both the geography of the city and the new opportunities this new world promises to all lost souls. (I should insert here something about the Statue of Liberty and its inscription, but I'm too lazy to look it up). Anyway, that's one of the reasons I judged the novel anchored in historical reality rather than fantasy. The second reason being the wonderful job Helene Wecker did in bringing to life the almost tribal neighborhood life of turn of the century New York, where newcomers still gathered together in ethnic based communitites, many of them still speaking only their native language and keeping strict adherence to ancestral customs. The Jewish and the Syrian communitites receive the lion's share of attention from the author, and the thoroughness of the research is impressive, easily letting me enjoy what could be considered the slower portions of the novel, focused on descriptions and secondary characters. The novel feels indeed longer than usual for a fashionable supernatural romance, but the attention to detail gives it authenticity and makes it an immersive experience. - Are you always this humorless? - Yes. Are you always this exasperating? Back to the real heroes of the story. They are nothing like each other, one being timid, serious, subservient, altruistic while the other is impetuous, proud, selfish, adventurous and extremely amoral. Earth and Fire! Typical romance stuff, you might say. Both are also prisoners not only of their born natures, but literally compelled to serve without question the orders of strangers. Chava was created from the start as a slave to her master's wishes, easily controlled through mystic incantations. Ahmad has been captured centuries ago, imprisoned in a copper lamp and bound to this plane of existence with an iron manacle by a powerful desert magician. Complicating the issue are Ahmad's very short fuse of his anger and Chava's awareness that golems are mentally unstable and pone to fits of murderous rage. Can they escape their traps and finally enjoy what normal people take for granted? Namely free will. The quest for free expression and the pursuit of happiness, coupled with the fight against their respective creators / magicians provides the action part of the plot, which gains steam rather late, as the novel reaches the final chapters. But let's not forget that this is also a romance story. So readers can also look forward to finding an answer to the question of the chances love has to bloom between two incompatible personalities. Before I finish I want to add some more words of praise for the talent of this debut author in creating compelling storylines and believable characters, as evidenced in the rich tapestry woven by the supporting cast, ranging from the already mentioned rabbi Meyer and metalsmith Arbeely, and continuing with Michael - a young Jewish social worker whose socialist politics are of a practical nature; Anna - a young bakery girl with bad luck in boyfriends; a rich heiress from the posh part of town; a taciturn Syrian boy with an agile mind; a former doctor possessed by malignant spirits (efriits) who sells icecream to kids on the street; the gossiping matron of an ethnic restaurant, and so on. Together they contribute to the big picture of a New York city that was still in 1899 the promised land for countless impoverished and persecuted people from the Old World. Outside New York and in a different timeline, the best story arc describes the nomadic life of Bedouin tribes, unchanged though millenia, and the tribulations of a young shepherd girl who attracts the attention of the amoral jinni. In conclusion, The Golem and The Jinni deserves all the votes in last year's popularity vote on Goodreads, and I hope the story will one day be filmed, as I believe it will translate well to the ilver screen. And I will be on the lookout for the next book from Helene Wecker. ...more When folklores from two diverse cultures tie the knots, it's a fantasy lover's dream come true. In this (almost) retrograde YA era of lascivious vampires, snarky witches, quasi-enigmatic aliens and some inane Greek heroes, someone needs to remind us that fantasy is something more than this carousel of cliches and cloying monotony. And that Helene Wecker does, with an unprecedented eloquence and a meticulously crafted fantasy setting weaved within the 19th century America. Jinni, the Arabic myth When folklores from two diverse cultures tie the knots, it's a fantasy lover's dream come true. In this (almost) retrograde YA era of lascivious vampires, snarky witches, quasi-enigmatic aliens and some inane Greek heroes, someone needs to remind us that fantasy is something more than this carousel of cliches and cloying monotony. And that Helene Wecker does, with an unprecedented eloquence and a meticulously crafted fantasy setting weaved within the 19th century America. Jinni, the Arabic mythical creature ( who, contrary to popular belief is not a tutelary spirit ) meets Golem, a creature of clay animated to life in this book, just as the title inadvertently confines it to. But there is so much more; the author has contrived a plot, anfractuous as the crowd's tread amidst New York's assumed complacency. We see mankind through the eyes of people with unimpeded thoughts, namely the djinni, Ahmad, a creature of fire, irascible but still foreign to his incarceration in the sapient form and Chava, our lovely Golem, innocence personified. However, this book calls for undivided attention and a fairly patient understanding of the enormity because what the author presented is much more than a fantasy, so much so that it's easy to forget that it even harbors a mythical facet. There are a bevy of characters and since Ms Wecker decided upon a third person narrative, each of them have been efficiently explored. For about the first half of the book, it's difficult to imagine how they all fit together and when that happens you may either feel perfunctory ( in which case, you'd end up not completing it ) or you may relish every chapter just like a short story written with insight into the immigrant experience in the throes of a life away from ones homeland. The author shows an obvious propensity for the minutiae of everyday life, an aspect I immensely enjoy and one that crosses boundaries of time and space to speak to you. As the book progresses, it flaunts a distinctive charm that is hard to come by in a Fantasy novel, some sort of interconnected chronicle of people's lives fraught with vicissitudes that kept me coming back for more, every time I closed it. There was one character, Saleh, a former-doctor back in Syria and now an impoverished, decrepit and self-sequestered Ice-Cream seller in New York. The author explored the story of his life in about thirty pages right from the zenith of his career to his senility, at the time of which I distinctly remember debating whether it was necessary to verbosely treat an insignificant character even if it was beautifully done. It was not only him, I realized later but also the disgraced Rabbi, Yedudah Schaalman seeking the elixir of life and Michael Levy, the nephew of the benevolent Avram Meyer, another Rabbi, as different from Schaalman as one could be and the desert girl of another time, Fadwa or her family. It all spliced together to weave a net of expectations so intricate that I could no longer distinguish what I wanted. But somehow, inexplicably, the author seemed to know it. Then there was this question of Faith in God raised. Religion. I'm definitely not the embodiment of piety and so I might point out that I'm apologizing in advance if I offend anyone. I have often thought that my Grandmother used Religion as a crutch. And so does one of the characters Michael Levy about his uncle, Rabbi Meyer. It was a subtle interplay of the apostate's thoughts and the Jinni's heretical questions that led me into an excogitating mood one day and I still don't believe unquestioningly in God but I respect that others do. It all comes down what my mother replied when I told her about my idea of religion, \"It's not a crutch, it's something like a placebo, and you'd never know what/who God is unless you've come across a problem bigger than you\" True, I've lived in the proverbial glass castle all my life. ( Another supple metaphor of the Jinni's cavalier mien I appreciate to no extent. You'll know what I mean only if you have read the book. ) Tiny revelations that simmer down to be memorable, on the book's part. All in all, it's not about instant gratification but a slow foray into a world that beats in sync with the reader's musings and eventually unravels to reveal the gem it is. ...more If you claim you like fantasy but you don't like this book, then what you like is silly wizards and hot werewolf-on-chick action, or else secondary world fantasy with elves and dragons and lost swords and shit, which is all well and good but I'm gonna be totally judgmental about any so-called fantasy fan who doesn't like this book because it's \"too long\" or too \"slow-moving\" or whatever stupid reason it failed to score with you. The Golem and the Jinni is a carefully constructed modern fable wri If you claim you like fantasy but you don't like this book, then what you like is silly wizards and hot werewolf-on-chick action, or else secondary world fantasy with elves and dragons and lost swords and shit, which is all well and good but I'm gonna be totally judgmental about any so-called fantasy fan who doesn't like this book because it's \"too long\" or too \"slow-moving\" or whatever stupid reason it failed to score with you. The Golem and the Jinni is a carefully constructed modern fable written as seriously as any historical literary fiction. The main characters, two creatures right out of Jewish and Arabic myth, blend perfectly into this novel of early 20th century New York. What is more fantastic than that? It's a rich book, reading at times like one of those sweeping classic character epics like Middlemarch or Les Miserables (but not as wordy and with far less infodumping). There are a fairly large number of characters, each with a character arc that runs the length of the book, eventually tying into the resolution. We start in 1899 in Poland with an unpleasant fellow who has been successful in business but due to being a poorly socialized schmuck, unsuccessful in matrimony. Rather than figuring out how to woo the ladies properly, he gets the bright idea to go to a local rabbi rumored to know dark Kabbalistic magic, and asks him to make him a wife. Helene Wecker does a wonderful job of describing just the sort of loser who'd buy a RealDoll. Since this is 1899, he buys a golem instead. Unlike RealDolls, golems can walk, talk, and think. They have their own personalities and desires \u2014 a fact upon which much of what follows hinges, as the golem's master-to-be specifies \"curiosity\" along with \"modesty\" and \"obedience\" for his clay bride. Unfortunately, there is also another little detail from Jewish legends that Helene Wecker weaves skillfully into the story: deep down, golems are murderous creatures who will eventually turn on their masters and have to be destroyed. Golem legends were of course the precursor to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein . Chava is not nearly so tragic \u2014 she awakens in the hold of a ship (her \"husband\" couldn't wait), but when her \"husband\" dies, she finds herself alone in New York City \u2014 obedient, modest, and curious. She knows what she is, but not what to do with herself. She is constructed such that she can pass as a human, so she manages, awkwardly, to integrate herself into New York's Jewish immigrant community, finding that her tirelessness and precision makes her very good at useful skills like baking and sewing. Meanwhile, in the Syrian immigrant community, a tinsmith named Boutros Arbeely is brought an old copper flask to repair. He manages to open it and release a jinni who's been trapped in the flask for a thousand years. \"Ahmad,\" as he calls himself, has a very different personality than Chava. He is a creature of fire and caprice, bound to a human form. He's not evil or cruel, but he's used to doing what he pleases without worrying about consequences. His jinni powers make him an able assistant to Boutros Arbeely, but the mundanity of life among humans is soon driving him mad. Eventually, by chance, the golem and the jinni meet. They are both the ultimate foreigners in a sea of immigrants. Despite being from different worlds, they understand each other better than even the few humans who know their natures can. Their friendship is perfect, awkward, believable, and of course, it gets sorely tested. As a fantasy novel, The Golem and the Jinni succeeds because it makes golems and jinni fit in a perfectly believable fashion into the tapestry of early 20th century life. It's not a \"secret wizarding world\" setting \u2014 it's just a world where some of those old legends might actually be true. There aren't vampires and faeries and wizards everywhere, but here and there, if you look for it, there's a bit of magic. The magic isn't the point, though it's much more than just an incidental background detail. The natures of the golem and the jinni and the magic that forms them play critical roles in the climax, but this is a character-driven novel. Chava and Ahmad are both great protagonists. Chava is wise and kind and well-intentioned, but she's not a perfect helpmate \u2014 she becomes frustrated and bored with people, and deep in her heart is that murderous golem nature she's not yet even aware of. Ahmad is kind of a jerk \u2014 he likes building pretty things, seducing mortal women, and then moving on \u2014 but forced to live on the ground among mankind, he's also forced to confront their reactions to his actions. He's still impatient, petty, and arrogant, but he's not without scruples or compassion. The secondary characters fill in the edges of the story. \"Ice Cream Saleh,\" a one-time learned physician possessed by an evil spirit, cursed to never look another person in the face until he sees a man of flame on the streets of New York City. The kindly Rabbi Meyer, who recognizes Chava for what she is, and his nephew Michael, an apostate Jew who runs a shelter for new immigrants and falls in love with Chava, having no idea what she is. There are many other characters whose stories intersect Chava's and Ahmad's, ending with a confrontation with Chava's creator, who has a connection to the events Ahmad has forgotten that sealed him in his flask a thousand years ago. This is Helene Wecker's debut novel, but I would never have thought it was a first novel. And unlike so many debut fantasy novels, it's entirely self-contained. Wecker probably could write a sequel, but I think rather than simply continuing the story of Chava and Ahmad, she'd do much better to write another book like this but with a completely different setting and characters. I will definitely read it! This is the sort of thick, juicy fantasy that should appeal to all fans of thick juicy fantasies and historical fiction alike. Rich in characters and setting details, judicious about using magic as a plot device, not a character, a mystical force that doesn't need to be meticulously systemitized to make sense. The Golem and the Jinni is literary fantasy that doesn't fill its pages with unnecessary side trips into some hidden magical world just to detail other creatures; it spends its time on character development and describing a vivid turn-of-the-century New York populated by immigrants of all kinds. My highest recommendation! ...more After finishing this lovely and lyrical book on Saturday afternoon, I continued holding it for a while, reluctant to let it go, to put it down on the bedside table, wanting to stay wrapped in the translucent veil of the story just a little longer. Here are the bare bones of the plot. A golem and a jinni find themselves in turn-of-the-century New York. To fit in, the golem becomes a baker. The jinni becomes a tinsmith.

Once upo After finishing this lovely and lyrical book on Saturday afternoon, I continued holding it for a while, reluctant to let it go, to put it down on the bedside table, wanting to stay wrapped in the translucent veil of the story just a little longer. Here are the bare bones of the plot. A golem and a jinni find themselves in turn-of-the-century New York. To fit in, the golem becomes a baker. The jinni becomes a tinsmith. But oh, there\u2019s so much more. This book is like a fable, a new folktale. Once upon a time, in Jewish communities sprinkled throughout Eastern Europe, men studied Talmud and ran businesses, and women washed and scrubbed and cooked and marketed and sewed and raised children. In fact, you could say that a woman was no better than a golem; bound to one master, expected to be submissive in nature, doomed to repeat the same dreary tasks again and again until she died\u2014and was returned to the earth. And then, beginning in the 1880s, Jews started emigrating to America. Where, with a little luck, a person could be anything she chose to be, if she worked hard enough. So, yes, Chava is a golem, made from clay, who has lost her master. But she doesn't like freedom. Independence means having to make decisions, having to lead her own life. Her greatest wish is to appear normal, and her greatest terror, being discovered for what she truly is. She must constantly fight the desire to help everyone she meets, people whose needs batter her and intrude upon her thoughts, wherever she goes. Incidentally, this describes pretty much every woman I\u2019ve ever met. Like Chava, Ahmad the jinni is not quite human; he\u2019s made of fire, literally and figuratively. When he emerges from the copper flask that contains him, he has no idea how he was trapped there, or for how long. He's fairly certain that it involved a wizard, but his memory of the actual event is blanked out. Ahmad becomes an artisan, a metalworker in Little Syria. By day, he repairs pots with Arbeely, the immigrant who accidentally freed him. By night, the jinni roams the streets of Manhattan, occasionally trysting with Sophia Winston, a vaguely unhappy heiress, who like the golem, is doomed to live out a dull, predictable existence. Sophia is a gilded bird in a gilded cage, like the little sculptures Ahmad makes to amuse himself. It took me a while to figure him out, but when I did, it hit me with blinding force. Ahmad is every artist who ever left a sad past behind him and traveled somewhere far away to create a new life--a life in New York, where you can be anyone you want to be. Delicately, like one of the jinni's filigreed designs or the golem\u2019s braided challahs, Wecker weaves the threads of her story, finally bringing Chava and Ahmad together. Though they are temperamental opposites\u2014the golem is all about caution and practicality, Ahmad is drawn to the element of risk\u2014to their surprise, they find they need and complement each other. To be fair, I should mention that this book landed in my heart with a surprising thump of familiarity. Both of these people are me, the artist and the nice Jewish girl. Little Syria, on Washington Street, was my old stomping grounds; when I lived downtown, my favorite breakfast place was Florent, on Ganesvoort Street. I want to tell you more, but it wouldn\u2019t be fair. Let's just say that this is a book about desire, and about sublimating those desires. About art, and the art of creation. About love, about responsibility, about overcoming tragedy, and about learning to live with the things you\u2019ve done. A book of fire and earth. ...more I'd have given this four stars if I'd enjoyed this book more. Don't get me wrong, it's is very, very well and richly written.

EDIT: Actually, after a lot of thought, I'm bumping this down to a two star rating. The more I thought about it, the more I realized there were elements that just did not work in this book and that was no failing on my part as a reader. Like, there was actually not point to the character of Sophia. I imagined how the story would go without her being there and realized there would be no great loss. Another thing that struck me as ridiculous was (view spoiler) [the sudden reveal that Schulman was the reincarnation of the wizard who imprisoned the Jinni (hide spoiler) ] . It seemed like a last-minute, desperate grab by the author to throw extra drama into the novel. Also, (view spoiler) [the death of Michael was completely unnecessary. Especially when the fallout from his death is completely glossed over after the fact in what felt like an 'oh well' resolution. (hide spoiler) ] This novel had a lot of good elements, but there was also a lot wrong with it when it came to the third act of the novel. And that's really very unfortunate for something that had so much potential. ...more This is the story of a golem and a jinni, how they discover who they are, their strengths, their weaknesses, and how, even though they're composed of completely different elements, they may just be the best friend for each other in a human world where they will never truly belong.

I'm such a geek. As I was reading The Golem and the Jinni , enjoying their adventures and waiting to see how they would discover their origins, I didn't consider for a moment the idea that the tale could be a metaphor for something else. Which is really dumb because I tend to write entirely in metaphors so you think I'd have a clue when I was reading somebody else's, but no. When I read the Q&A with the author at the end of the book, I was really kicking myself. Of course, it made total sense as a metaphor for cultural differences. And, when I thought about it that way, I liked the story even more. On the other hand, this tale can be completely enjoyed and interpreted as a historical fiction/fairytale and, if you're not in the mood to think any deeper than that, it doesn't matter, because it's still awesome. So, it's a win/win book for the deep thinkers and the no thinkers. The Golem and the Jinni is not a fast read. Wecker really builds the characters and gives the back story for everybody who comes across the page. At first I was like, \"Do we really need to know the Ice Cream Dude's life story?\" and I was getting frustrated with the pacing of it. But, as her characters came together and their lives began to intertwine, I began to appreciate the true artistry of the novel. It is like an orchestral fugue in which the instruments play their themes one by one at the beginning, which is beautiful, but when the tones combine, it lifts the piece to a whole other place. That is The Golem and the Jinni . Give it the time and space to build the characters and you will be blown away by the ending. At least, I was. Wecker has a talent for creating multi-layered characters. Though the golem is only a few hours old, the author manages to instill in her a childlike curiosity mixed with the timelessness of a magical creature. Here, the golem is seeing the Statue of Liberty for the first time: \"The deck was crowded with people, and at first the Golem didn't see what they were waving at. But then, there she was: a gray-green woman standing in the middle of the water, holding a tablet and bearing aloft a torch. Her gaze was unblinking, and she stood so still: was it another golem? ... And those on deck were waving and shouting at her with jubilation, crying even as they smiled. This, too, the Golem thought, was a constructed woman. Whatever she meant to the others, she was loved and respected for it. For the first time... the Golem felt something like hope. pg 17 ebook. She also describes scenes just beautifully. In this passage, the Jinni sees New York harbor: \"The Jinni leaned against the railing, transfixed by the view. He was a creature of the desert, and never in his life had he come so close to this much water. It lapped at the stone below his feet, reaching now higher, now lower. Muted colors floated on its surface, and afternoon sunlight reflecting in the ever-changing dips of the waves. Still it was hard to believe that this was not some expert illusion, intended to befuddle him. At any moment he expected the city and water to dissolve, to be replaced by the familiar steppes and plateaus of the Syrian Desert, his home for close to two hundred years.\" pg 23 ebook I loved the little, let's call them \"wisdom nuggets,\" that Wecker sprinkled throughout the story. Like: \"A man might desire something for a moment, while a larger part of him rejects it. You'll need to learn to judge people by their actions, not their thoughts.\" pg 40 ebook. Or: \"Men need no reason to cause mischief, only an excuse!\" pg 172 ebook. I also connected with this passage where the Jinni is thinking about the power of names: \"To him the new name suggested that the changes he'd undergone were so drastic, so pervasive, that he was no longer the same being at all. He tried not to dwell on such dark thoughts, and instead concentrated on speaking politely, and maintaining his story- but every so often, as he listened to the chatter of yet more visitors, he spoke his true name to himself in the back of his mind, and took comfort in the sound.\" pg 68 ebook. It has nothing to do with this story but that, among many reasons, is why I refused to change my name when I was married. I recommend The Golem and the Jinni for folks who enjoy historical fiction blended with fantasy, folks who love deep characters, and for anyone who loves to read beautiful prose. This book has all of that. Some read-alikes: The Wise Woman by Philippa Gregory or Queen of Kings by Maria Dahvana Headley. ...more One of the most awesome covers I have ever seen.Maybe the best of the best!

It is unique and magical . Can I just go on describing this book with more suitable adjectives? Even then, I wouldn't even be close to describing this book. Sigh. Chava is a Golem. A being made out of clay. Ahmad is a Jinni. A being made out of fire. And their destinies are bound to collide. You would think that once they meet each other, the story will progress with them knowing each other better, them falling in love and fighting the villains who threaten to tear them apart. You're wrong. This is not a book about their romance. This is a book about their discoveries as people. As humans. Helene Wecker's writing is whimsical and fairy tale like and I completely adored her writing style. It's so easy to immerse oneself into. She starts the story beautifully and ends it beautifully and everything in between is also completely beautiful. This is one of those books that you should just read without knowing much about it. The tiny nuances of this book, the not so surprising surprises, the little, little stuff we normally ignore or blindly read thinking it wouldn't stay long in our memory, it all stays, trust me. Wecker's writing will preserve every little detail in your memory. Even the simple act of baking bread would stay in your memory and you might even yearn to smell it or probably read the book again just to have the feel of it. Wecker's writing is that atmospheric. After I finished this book, I tried telling this story to my father. I couldn't. It came out lamely like how this review is turning out to be. When my dad asked, \"That's all?\", I shouted and said there's more but I honestly couldn't capture the essence of this book in a few short lines. One must read this book to understand what it contains. It's so very hard to put my jumbled, awe-struck thoughts into coherent words. \u201cSometimes men want what they don't have because they don't have it. Even if everyone offered to share, they would only want the share that wasn't theirs.\u201d Pick this book up. You won't regret it. ...more In a nutshell: A beautifully written, atmospheric novel.

I've wanted to read The Golem and the Djinni (also titled 'Jinni' in other editions) for a long time now. I still remember buying it after Fatima told me about it, but - like so many other books - I put it off. Now, like so many other books, I'm regretting the months it sat unread on my shelf because it was so wonderful! The book is set in New York in 1899, following Chava and Ahmad - the Golem and the Djinni - through their separate and later connected lives hidden among humans. The focus shifts between several characters, who are complex and interesting in their own way. I didn't find all of them likeable but I definitely appreciated the extent of their development and history. The antagonist was particularly well-developed. My favourite character was Chava. From the beginning, I felt for her and I liked her quiet personality. Ahmad grew on me a lot the more I read and I really liked the bond that he shared with Chava, which I didn't interpret as anything romantic myself. Helene Wecker's prose is stunning. It reminds me of The Night Circus with its pacing and atmosphere. While reading, I felt like I was in late-19th century New York and the desert. The history, culture, religion and fantasy elements blended together really well. It's a very slow-paced read but not in a boring way. Instead it was captivating and I didn't want to rush my way through. The beginning kept me reading because of the intrigue; the final chunk was impossible to put down because I wanted to know what was going to happen. I liked the ending - it finalised things, but also left things open for more. The final line itself made me smile. I'm very wary about the sequel because I feel as though it's not necessary and I'm content enough imagining what happens next, but knowing me I'll still probably check it out anyway. I doubt I'll be able to resist.

I never longed for a paragraph or chapter to come to its tiresome conclusion. This is a credit to the writing style of Helene Wecker. She is simply wonderful. The story she tells is simply wonderful. A perfect blend of fantasy, involving a golem and a jinni, and real life issues told in a setting of New York City during the turn of the 20th century. The story tells of love, religious doubt, diversity, morality, and struggles of life. I am not sure if Helene Wecker reaped any literary accolades for her work on The Golem and Jinni, but I can honestly say that if she continues to write like this, she certainly will soon enough. I ranked this book the most stars available here at Goodreads, and highly recommend you put this one on your must read list right away! ...more Exceptionally disappointing.

If you take these characters out of turn of the century New York and put them in 1920s Los Angeles, 1950s Las Vegas, or any other major developing city in the world, neither they nor their stories would change. On that note, where is the clash of cultures? If you are going to write a story about a clash between cultures, try not to paint those cultures with such a broad brush that they are essentially the same. Mr. and Mrs. Radzin and Mr. and Mrs. Faddoul are the same couple. Anna Blumberg's tragedy is no more or less than Matthew Mounsef's tragedy. And Ibn Malik is literally the same person as Yeduah Schaalman! The only differences between cultures here are expressed in their mythologies, not in their characters-which is this novel's biggest offense. Characters from both cultures speak to each other as native--modern--English speakers. The reader is supposed to know intuitively that when Chava talks to people, she speaks Yiddish, and when Ahmad talks to people, he speaks Arabic. But all of the sentences have the same modern English structure. If there is a choice between culture existing in tradition and myth or in everyday interactions between people, it cannot be both, can it? The jinni is also annoyingly well-adjusted to urban life after two hundred years in the desert plus another thousand imprisoned in a copper flask. The story is entertaining, but the human characters deserve to be more flushed out. Read if you are in the mood for atmosphere but little substance. ...more 2.5 I first heard about this book recently when a friend read it and said he was very impressed with it - he said it was much better than what he was expecting.

So I'm a bit sad to say that I wasn't really all that wowed with it. Now, don't get me wrong - it's not a bad book or anything, and maybe it's just a case of disappointed expectations, but I felt kinda meh about it for much of the time, and now, writing about it a few days later, I can't say it really left all that much of an impression. (I even kept forgetting I had to write this review.) I think my biggest sticking point was that this is a very character oriented story, but I never really connected with the characters. I was interesting in the idea of a golem and a jinni being thrust into our world in their varying circumstances - an idea which reminded me a bit of American Gods - but neither this story's characters or prose engaged me in the way AG did. It's hard to plod through a slow-moving, character-based book where not much happens for the first 1/2, or even 3/4, when you don't really care all that much about the characters outside of a vague, almost academic, interest. I also wish there was more of the cultures being portrayed in the book. I never really felt the time period, nor did I feel really immersed in either the Jewish or Arab communities in which the creatures lived in. Considering how much time is spent slowly developing the characters and all, I would just think that some of that would come across more. The speed did pick up a lot towards the end, when a lot of stuff started happening - but I'm not sure I was really thrilled with how some stuff played out. The reveal felt sort of... I don't know if cliched is really the right word... maybe forced? I mean, the fact that (view spoiler) [the guy who created the golem just happens to be the reincarnation of the same guy who captured the jinni? (hide spoiler) ] There were a lot of coincidences throughout the book, but that one just sort of tipped things a bit more to the negative for me. Also, I wasn't all that happy with the end confrontation. I would've preferred something along the lines of how (view spoiler) [since the golem only accepted Schaalman as master under cohersion, it would've been cool if, when he forced her to do something she really didn't want to do, she could've broken the hold he had over her - a triumph of her will over her nature. But we get nothing of that, and just a sort of sloppy battle instead. (hide spoiler) ] Ultimately, I was much more pleased with Ahmad's development and growth through the story. He, at least, had some... Though I suppose that's part of the point - some people, mythological or otherwise, are more bound by their natures than others. But I still can't say it left me with positive feelings regarding the book. Once again, however, I am in the vast minority, and I certainly can't say that there aren't good and interesting things about the book - it just didn't leave me feeling very satisfied, and I very much wish that I could say otherwise. *le sigh* ...more When you end up talking about a book a year later and wanting to shove it into the hands of every reader you pass in the bookstore, you know a book was unbelievably good.

The story slowly builds, and things become tense when we learn a dangerous wizard is hoping to capture the jinni. My favorite character in the book was the rabbi who helped the golem. The rabbi's kindness and wisdom were comforting, and I liked how he tried to plan for the golem's future. Similarly, his nephew, Michael, was another beloved character who got caught up in a story he didn't expect. I don't read a lot of fantasy, but I'm glad I gave this book my time. It was thoughtful, well-written, and I enjoyed the various plot lines. I listened to this on audio, which I highly recommend because of the marvelous narrator. After I finished this book, I looked up the author and learned she's working on a sequel. Hooray! Favorite Quotes \"All of us are lonely at some point or another, no matter how any people surround us. And then, we meet someone who seems to understand. She smiles, and for a moment the loneliness disappears.\" \"A man might desire something for a moment, while a larger part of him rejects it. You'll need to learn to judge people by their actions, not their thoughts.\" \"Faith is believing in something even without proof, because you know it in your heart to be true.\" \"If the act of love is so dangerous, why do people risk so much for it?\" ...more Intrigued, then pleased and delighted, then touched by the poignancy, then possessed by the suspense... .....what happened?

Around the turn of the last century a female golem ends up masterless in New York. Because she's not attached to the will of a master she hears the needs of everybody, a difficulty she must master, not to mention that she doesn't breath or sleep or need food and has, er, anger-management problems. Meanwhile, it so happens that a jinni--a very different creature but also extra-human--also ends up in the vicinity. The golem cares too much but the jinni doesn't care enough; he's a temperamental artist, frustrated because he must condense all his energies into such a narrow channel. How there came to be a golem, why the jinni is trapped in human form, what's going on, who did it, what does he want, who gets swept up, and how will it all unwind--the plot consists of those questions. The folklore is done so that it melds with ordinary reality, just the way it might be if you happened to be living circa 1890 in some shtetl modernity has never touched. That's the golem part. The jinni part takes me back to the pictures in a Grosset & Dunlap Illustrated Junior Library book: Andersen's Fairy Tales , and the illustrations of Arthur Szyk. Yes, I had their Arabian Nights , too, but that turns out to be a different illustrator, and I'm channeling Arthur Szyk. For example (thanks to Bing): What's odd is that in their inner life the golem and the jinni are the most fully fleshed out people in the book. I particularly identified with the golem. I'm not talking about her super strength or ability to go gol-istic. Aren't women programmed for sensitivity to the needs of others? Whether we say it's nature or nurture, it just seemed to elicit an \"aha!\" of recognition. And what about the two creatures' secret powers that they find they have and must learn to manage? When we human beings argue with \"the other\"--other factions, other segments of society, or maybe just my sibling, parent, or spouse this time--we are evolutionarily programmed for self protection--to see \"them,\" the opponent, as powerfully dangerous and invincible, deserving of whatever we can throw at them, while we see our own selves, our \"side,\" as tender, weak, and vulnerable, in need of and deserving of all possible defense. And what is the best defense but an excellent offense? So we have a sort of built-in optical illusion that keeps us from seeing our own secret powers and the destruction we wreak all around and leave in our wake. Mostly we do not even know our own power, much less seek to harness it. This isn't really a semi-messianic super-power golem here to fight for truth, justice, and the American way. Whatever the plot, I go for the character. I'm always trying to find something out. Thanks, Helene Wecker. I don't know if you put this part in on purpose or if it just happened, but it's fine by me. P.S. Rest assured this novel works on multiple levels. ...more The Golem and the Jinni is a slow builder, that's for sure. I was never bored, but there were a couple times when I wondered what it was building towards and when it was going to step it up. It's not action-driven whatsoever, so I'd only recommend this if you enjoy 19th Century historical fiction that is character-driven. The fantasy element is there, a fine thread woven throughout that adds an exotic touch. But it doesn't play a large role until near the end of the book.

And by the way, I really liked how that aspect came together. I also liked how the details of day-to-day living allowed me to savor the particular flavor of the immigrant experience in New York, and how it subtly built into something much more. By about 60% I didn't want to put it down because I was so invested in the characters and had to see what would happen to them. The ending was not a perfectly neat bow, but not a cliffhanger, either. I'm glad to discover there will be a sequel, although it's jumping time periods to WWI, so I'm not sure what to think about that. A large part of what I enjoyed about this book was the setting, so we'll see. I'll definitely check it out. ...more 4.5/5 In any piece of work, there is the choice of how far the balance of inner and outer will tip in favor of either.

I'll let you know of modifications to this maxim should computers start composing quality literature all of their own initiative, but until then, it's fit to stand. The Golem and the Jinni is a first novel of a future bibliography I will be deeply invested in. I know this to be the case because, while the structuring of the plot and characters shows its minute planning in the way most first works do, there is a strong underpinning of genuine concern for ethics, choice, the lives we lead and the differences between that can make or break a soul or existence. Through the freedom of the Golem and the bondage of the Jinni comes a tale where the free forget, the claimed delight, and each are equally capable of horrifying possibilities with nary a voluntary effort between them. Fiction has become too complacent with its monsters. Vampires, werewolves, whatever mystical denizens have grown popular in the supernatural romance genre these days, all of them act in the same way without ever a reconciliation with their opposing natures. Should they be of human tendency, eventually they will face the question of mortality and their participation on both sides of the equation. Should they not, it is up to the author to craft an entity recognizably \"inhuman\", something as unswayed by our little experiments in government policies as a tiger is by the constructions of ants, a being likely to pay more attention to our infringement on its territory than any system of ethics based on our emotional capabilities. Of course, if they are of a theological nature, they will involve themselves a little more with our sorts, but if after thousands of years we have only perfected our intake of living things deemed lower than ourselves, what flavor shall that involvement be? Wecker takes the first path of humanized otherworldly beings, one that plays well to her strengths. While no Clarke in terms of expert worldbuilding and the most eerie of supernatural overtones I have ever had the pleasure of reading, she has a deep and abiding interest in what makes differences tick in a world in which only similarities survive. I'm pleased to say that, while I've seen reviews praising historical fiction that does not pander to \"feminist revisionism\" (which only goes to show you how successful the reaction periods have been in erasing Emma Goldman and ideological kin), Wecker makes both women and men conscious of the dissonance between action and desire. It is an avoidance of rose-colored glasses that covers religion along with class and perseveres to the very end, forbearing a happy ending obfuscation of anything but for something far less decreed and far more enduring. Someone make a miniseries for this, please. Done well enough, it would be a real triumph. ...more I hardly ever read physical books due to how difficult they are to obtain here, but these days I find myself missing them more and more.

This book grabbed me from the outset. It took a while for the pace to truly pick up, but once things got started, I couldn't put it down. The writing is enchanting, but not so much that it overshadows the plot. I adored both the Golem and the Jinni (if not the Jinni a little more) and found them believable despite the fantasy element. This book has quite a few characters, but concluding the story took a bit longer than it should have. The last hundred pages or so were overly convoluted and simultaneously predictable. My feelings for the characters were so strong that I had expectations for how the story should end. The ending fell short, but I think that's my own fault in a way. All the same, if you're looking for something captivating, I would recommend this. ...more I absolutely loved this book!

The Golem, Chava, a creature of earth, I absolutely loved this book! It's a charming tale that brings together the exotic magic of an Arabian Nights fable and the bustling reality of immigrant neighborhoods in turn-of-the-century New York. Magical creatures are thrown into the mix with humans, all struggling to find their place in the New World. The story alternates viewpoints, following the two title characters, the Golem and the Jinni, along with the humans who become important in their lives. The Golem, Chava, a creature of earth, and the Jinni, Ahmad, a creature of fire, at first seem to be opposites. She is driven to serve and please others, while he is completely self-absorbed and feels only impatience for the needs and wishes of others. Both Chava and Ahmad, upon their arrival in New York, are fortunate to immediately come in contact with humans who believe their supernatural origins (since Ahmad materializes out of a copper pot, he can hardly be disbelieved). These two people, a rabbi and a metalsmith, are compassionate and generous enough to take in their otherworldly charges and support them while giving them guidance on how to adjust to this new environment. The struggles of Chava and Ahmad to fit into this foreign land mirror the difficulties of the immigrants themselves, although the Golem and the Jinni also have to remember to act human, which is equally foreign to them. Theology plays a large part in this book. Religion and faith is examined through the lenses of the varying stages of belief of the characters. The Golem and the Jinni both live in communities that value and practice religion. In contrast to the devout characters, we have those who have abandoned their faith, and their doubts and disillusionments are discussed, as well. Chava, having been nurtured by a rabbi, is willing to accept the existence of God, while the Jinni has nothing but good-natured contempt for the idea of \"a ghost in the sky who grants wishes.\" Their conversations with their benefactors and each other grapple with questions of God's existence, the role of faith in people's lives, and the benefits of faith to a community. The topics of friendship, love, loyalty, and sacrifice are also important to the development of the novel. We watch Chava and Ahmad, so different at first, as they are influenced by their surroundings and each other and begin to change and grow. They each have valuable lessons to teach the other, and the true magic is in watching them grow beyond the limits proscribed by their species. Ms. Wecker's writing is enchanting, as well, and transports the reader effortlessly from a glass palace in the Syrian desert to the crowded tenements of New York, from the moonlit beauty of Central Park at night to the seedy world of New York's rooftops. I highly recommend it! ...more", "Title": "The Golem and the Jinni"},
