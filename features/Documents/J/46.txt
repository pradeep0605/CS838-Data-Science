Run! there is a lot that I found to be surprisingly and personally enjoyable in this one. the senior class in question is class of 1988. so was I! they listen to songs like Oh Yeah by Yello. so did I! our protagonist wants to direct thrillers when he grows up. so did I! the neighboring South Bend, Indiana is considered a Big City, heh. I lived in South Bend! the book has some problems. there is at times a cringe-inducing and rather amateurish clumsiness to the writing. supporting characters who are flattened into caricature. a character who is eliminated by a murder of crows (<---B>nice one</---B>) just disappears from the story. where's that body? but none of that matters during the book's lengthy central portion, it's pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: the increasingly ominous then terrifying nighttime journey through the cornfield by our band of protagonists. all the problems with the prose fall away during the middle of the book; the story had its hooks into me and wouldn't let go until the end. West creates a wonderfully spooky and menacing atmosphere, indulges in some over-the-top gore, and even plays a couple narrative tricks on the reader to ratchet up the suspense and horror. it all worked perfectly during these chapters. I was absorbed and frightened. if you like to be scared, I highly recommend the central part of The Wide Game. it's awesome and would make a great horror flick. some spoilers in the next paragraph but I will try to keep it ambiguous I have to make mention of a repulsively fundamentalist twist in the book. it made me so furious that I nearly deleted the book from my e-reader. teens who commit suicide suffer in hell forever? emphasis on suffer, emphasis on forever? teens who have been terrorized, abused and mentally tortured, made genuinely unstable? they are condemned to suffer in hell forever, really? I don't hate a lot of things (outside of, say, genocide or child molestation or rape), I try to keep an open mind about context and personal perspective. but I think I can honestly say that I don't just loathe that particular point of view's cruelty, I loathe any person who genuinely thinks that way. I think it is an evil perspective. I hope this is not the author's actual viewpoint but the religious framing within the novel makes me suspect otherwise. when I come across such a loathsome, unempathetic, cruel way of looking at life and the afterlife, when I have the misfortune of meeting someone who actually thinks this way... I only want to do one thing. Run! ...more This book was absolutely awesome! I can definitely say after reading this book that I'm more afraid of corn fields than ever before.

Meanwhile the reader follows his memories of that Wide Game played before graduation, and wonders at the cost. The Wide Game is classic horror, with teenagers separating in the dark when you know they ought to stay together, with something scary in the cornfield, and with romantic leads just desperate to survive. But survival isn\u2019t everything, and there are gaps in the gruesome details where nobody knows just who or what is setting the rules for the game. And then there\u2019s death. And then there\u2019s the school reunion. The Wide Game is told in separate parts which tie past and present together and lead inexorably, but secretly, to final scary conclusions where a church, once scorned, just might play its own part in healing... because some things just can\u2019t be earned after all. I enjoyed the whole story, but I truly loved the ending; that touch of thought-provoking mystery that raises a tale above its genre and makes it something special. Disclosure: I was given a free ecopy during the author\u2019s blog tour. I\u2019m just sorry it took me so long to get around to reading it. ...more Harmony, Indiana is a small town overrun by endless fields of corn, young people languishing in the stereotypical boredom inescapable with small town living, and yes, legends of nightmare coupled with an underlying history of mystery, bloodshed, and horror.

Paul Rice grew up in this town, spent his high school years fraternizing with his circle of friends, aspiring to direct B-grade horror films, and falling in love with classmate Deidra. At a time when graduation is only days away, Paul and Deidra's relationship had blossomed into a bond the likes of which could almost be found in romantic fairy tales. And then came time for the class of 1988 to ditch class and undertake the coming-of-age ritual played out by the graduating classes of numerous years before them.....the time to play the Wide Game. The Wide Game is virtually a race where the object of all participants is to journey from the edge of a vast cornfield to a large clearing where a small man-made lake and good partying await --- a race that could take hours, considering the ground they have to cover and how one could easily get lost, considering also a certain strategy involving keeping quiet and stealing a belonging of anyone else playing the game that they encounter in the corn. Oh......and then there's also the matter of an ancient tribal Indian presence which inevitably screws with the graduates' minds, invoking psychedelic visions, unspeakable mayhem and the grisly murders of Wide Game players, one by one. <---A>Michael</---A> West proves himself to be a masterful storyteller, flawless in building momentum, and his skills in characterization match or even often surpass some of the most successful writers in the business. This is a first-rate novel, well edited and no holds barred. My jaw dropped, quite literally, at more than a handful of turning points in the story that I just didn't see coming, and I oftentimes couldn't put the book down. I know that's a pretty clich\u00e9 phrase, but coming from me......well, that sort of intense preoccupation just doesn't occur too often. This is a work of first-rate terror and suspense, and for the seasoned reader sports a refreshingly original story methodology as a means to scare the wits out of you. This is his first novel, and I'll be watching the career of Michael West with sincere interest in his works to come. And I'll never look at corn fields the same way again. ...more The Wide Game starts off with Paul Rice and his wife arriving at his mother\u2019s house back in his old hometown. This visit isn\u2019t just for family fun, however: it\u2019s also the day of his high school reunion. Feeling nostalgic, his mother pulls out his old high school yearbooks, which trigger horrible memories from his senior year where his class played a game out in the cornfields of Indiana known as \u201cThe Wide Game\u201d. This wasn\u2019t any kind of game, though, as many of his fellow students ended up dead.

This wasn\u2019t any kind of game, though, as many of his fellow students ended up dead. Written mostly as an extended flashback, The Wide Game takes the reader through the terrible night that Paul Rice, his girlfriend Deidra, and numerous other friends played The Wide Game their senior year. Running around in a cornfield during the middle of the night is spooky enough, but when you add in all of the \u201csurprises\u201d that await the students throughout the night, well\u2026 it can get to be terrifying! West has created a creepy tale with enough twists and turns to keep any reader sucked into the story, and still questioning what happened when arriving at the end. As an added bonus, there are \u201880s trivia factoids sprinkled throughout to readers (at least those of that era) to get in that nostalgic mood along with the cast. I would recommend The Wide Game to all fans of horror as it is the kind of story you\u2019d want to pull out on a dark, rainy night\u2026 especially if reading by flashlight out in the middle of a cornfield.

The characters themselves appeared to be archetypes from the same 80's popular culture that serves as the stories main setting. As in the popular 80's classic movie The Breakfast Club, you have the jock Danny, the Nerd Mick, the misunderstood bad boy Skip, and the popular girl Nancy. The main characters Paul and Deidra are generic interpretations of inseparable young love. The next portion of the book quickly runs these characters through a classic B horror movie gauntlet. Probably the most fun to be had in the novel is in this middle section which reads like a teen slasher flick. Finally the last section of the book seemed to show the most promise as a telling of the after effects and tying up loose ends, however this seemed to be hurried and served more as an epilogue offering a minor twist to the story. The whole book seemed to be building to something that never came. The books use of flashback, dream sequences, and character fantasies make the book at times feel like you are getting a vague impression of what is actually going on and there will be a clarifying moment. By the end you realize what you've read was pretty straight forward with no tricks. The mythology is a little mixed, originating from (spoilers) an evil Native American figurehead who required fights to the death to benefit the land where cornfields now sit. In the current time period of the novel this has somehow translated to a mix of mind control and demonic harassment of anyone coming on the land forcing them to kill. Other than the one minor twist noted above, there is no master plan being implemented through a crazed central character as may be inferred by the prologue. Generally what you see is what you get in the novel. The resolution of the book also includes the protagonist coming to grips with the events through his talk with a priest. This part felt a little \"preachy\" and is likely why I also saw this book on a Goodreads list labeled something to the effect of \"stories with strong Faith based characters\". To me it felt a little heavy and out of place. In general though the book kept me reading and as others have said, there are some fun 80's references and throwbacks to the past. Generally you should be reading this for some brief fun and not to expect a lot of twists and turns or overly complex plot. I would also like to add some commentary here that may be slightly unrelated to the review of The Wide Game. This book, like horror movies, may appeal to the viewer through its visceral experiences. In this regard I believe the sex scenes are a continuation of this experience and are not excessive or \"tacked on\" (as at least one other review has noted). These limited scenes are actually somewhat necessary to show the building of the main relationship in the story. These scenes do not come close to anything like a Harlequin romance. I find it a little disturbing that so many novels now are negatively critiqued for any sexual depictions, a fact I noticed as I read several other book reviews last night. This book had some very graphic kill scenes. I would hope these would startle the average conscious more than a rather tame telling of an experience the majority of the human race goes through. Are the sex scenes strictly necessary? Probably not. I would however argue that the majority of experiences in a fiction novel are not necessary but are there for the reader to enjoy, to add background to the characters, or show the reader someone else's interpretation of events. In this regard I believe the scenes are appropriate and well delivered. ...more For a first novel, The Wide Game displays a notable amount of promise.

The writing is particularly strong, as if author Michael West spent a long time honing his craft before submitting his manuscript to publishers. It's also more complicated than it seems at first glance, with some surprisingly deep themes eventually being raised. And though the idea behind the book isn't anything particularly new - a bunch of high school graduates get stalked through a remote location by someone or something that intends to do them significant harm - there are some effectively tense scenes, especially through the book's middle section. It wasn't all good though. The problems I had with The Wide Game lie with the way the story was told, and the manner in which the tale we get is quite different from that implied in the book's blurb. To illustrate this latter point, here's a paragraph lifted straight from the blurb: Now, as he meets the survivors of that day once more, Paul makes a chilling discovery: the incomprehensible forces that toyed with them have yet to finish playing their own game. Reading that I was anticipating the story to be about the survivors of the Wide Game from ten or so years before. Yet almost all of this novel takes place via an extended flashback. By the time we're back following those survivors in the present day, the book is about 75% over. In essence, the present day \"action\" serves as little more than a coda to the main meat of the tale when the protagonists were in the midst of the game. My use of quotation marks there serves to highlight how little actually happens in the present time. The reader is asked to care more about the main character and his relationship status than the threat that has been unveiled out amongst the corn rows. West does throw in a twist that adds an extra layer to the story, (view spoiler) [ but otherwise, said threat pretty much does nothing in the present day, making for a wholly unsatisfying end to the story. (hide spoiler) ] Perhaps West addresses these concerns in the sequels that follow this novel? I don't know, but I'm interested in finding out, mainly because he wrote the sequels years later, so I'm hoping they'll be all the better for the extra writing experience he'd have gained in that time. 3 Murders of Crows for The Wide Game . ...more Once again the small town of Harmony Indiana turns out to be less than harmonious.

All of the characters in the story felt like real people. I also liked the use of Native American mythology in it, each book in the Harmony, Indiana has a different mythology to it but still felt like the same universe that I enjoyed very much. This story had a little bit of a whodunnit and I didn't expect the twist towards the end. I hope there's a 4th book in the Harmony, Indiana series. I enjoyed reading the novel. The writing was clean and kept me in the story. I loved all the atmosphere of the corn field and the old building. The characters were my favorite part, all well developed and distinct. They grew and changed and kept me guessing but never made me question their actions. I stayed interested throughout, never had the impulse to skim, but didn't get lost because of gimmicks to keep the pace fast without adding anything to the story. Good read.

For the most part, the pace is smooth, even if the transition from adult to youth back to adult does slow down the story a bit. It makes for a quick, enjoyable read. However, the characters present a bit of a problem here. We aren\u2019t given much more than cardboard cutouts. They walk. They talk. They do stuff. But I just didn\u2019t feel like they were whole beings. I couldn\u2019t form any type of emotional bond to them. That\u2019s a big deal to me, especially when it comes to whether or not I\u2019d bother reading a book again in the future. I think it is partially due to splitting the POV so many times, but just as much due to glossing over their internal lives. I think I could have been much more invested than I ended up being. Also, I\u2019m not too hot on how the Miami gods and religion are portrayed. It is established that the Game was started by the old tribes, as a part of their deal with Mondamin, the corn god, that granted them fertile crops. But, as the cover art makes abundantly clear, thar be demons in them rows, laddie. While no direct correlation is spelled out, it is hard to ignore the implication the Miami Indians were demon worshipers. While that may fall in with some traditional religious teachings, it doesn\u2019t sit well with me. On the other hand, I do appreciate how West deals with the idea of sin and forgiveness. Especially in how they relate to guilt. How redemption does not necessarily remove guilt and certainly does not wash away the past. I found this approach quite interesting. If you\u2019re just in it for a quick good time, you\u2019ll fair well here. You may even find some interesting wrinkles to add to your next theological argument. I didn\u2019t find the heart to the characters that I was looking for and found some parts of the central conceit problematic. ...more Wow I honestly can't remember the last time I read books that made me feel like they were perfectly written. Perfect characterization, perfectly telling, perfect thrills, and perfect ending. Michael West has a reader for life. Fast read. Surprised by the amount of sex in the book. Wimpy ending though. Could have been much more sinister. I liked this book. It read like a campy low budget '80s movie... not that that is a bad thing. :-) I wish it didn't have the tacked on sex scenes.
