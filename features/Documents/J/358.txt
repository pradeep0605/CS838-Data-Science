I mean BREATHTAKING!!!!! This book is a novel, yet Colum McCann took his inspiration from biographical facts from Rudolf's life. WOW.... and what a story!!! Captivating....spanning over four decades. The lyrically powerful prose is seductive....intimate....bigger than life....\"dazzling\"!!!! Right from the start when 'Rudik' was a child in the Soviet Union ( 1941-1956)...we are transported back to the horrors of war. Injured soldiers were being cared for by women. Children have come to entertain their Russian Folk dance. A soldier with an amputated leg on crutches from tree branches caught Rudik's fascination. His mother couldn't afford carpet in his house.... so between the two, we see a 7 year old's imagination at work. He started spinning on one foot on his own wood floor in his own house. I thought of 'ALL THE PARENTS' who had these type of determined kids. At an early age, something stands out about their child....a PASSION - 'very young'. Rudolf was one of them. Years later .... A night on stage in London.... still only in in 20's: \"Rudi's body was a thing of the most captivating beauty--hard lines at his shoulders,<---M> his neck striated with muscle</---M>, enormous thighs, his calf muscles twitching. He took his partner in the air and spun her with remarkable lightness\". Part of a letter to his sister, Tamara, back home in Leningrad ( 1961 -1964) \"You choose to say my life is a circus now. Nothing is simple, Tamara, not even your attempts at simplification. Why did I do it? It was never my intention to leave. I could have stayed, but if you tread water long enough it is possible you might never learn to swim. I meant nothing by it. Politics is for fat men with cigars. It is not for me. I am a dancer. I live to dance. That is all\". In the way that I passionately love author Amor Towles writing .... Colum McCann, too, writes floating novels.

This is the story of the life of Russian Dancer Rudolf Nureyev and the people that surrounded him and for me it was the surrounding characters that took centre stage in this superbly written novel. I have read a few of McCann's novels some I have liked better than others but this story from the first chapter where Russian Soldiers returning from the Eastern front after World War II are entertained by the young Nureyev had me hooked. I am not a fan of Ballet and knew very little about the life of Nureyev and really had little interest in this book until I saw it was available in Whisper sync and I really love reading and listening to a book especially I want the correct pronunciation of foreign names people and places. The audio book for Dancer is excellent with different narrators for different characters and I didn't find it at all confusing switching between characters. McCann weaves his magic and tells an astonishing and quite believable story. The characters themselves are so wide and varied and the story is told from their viewpoints which makes this book so compelling. While I was quite interested in the story of Rudof, I was fascinated by the story of those he left behind in Russia and in life in general as it was through their voices we hear the real story. I am not sure I would have liked or cared for the dancer himself but I certainly appreciate his art and how hard he worked for the love of dance. There were times in the story when I didn't care for the scenes of sex or drugs and readers may not like this aspect of the story but I do understand that it belonged in the book. There is so much about this book that I loved, Colum McCann is a passionate writer and few authors match his insight, attention to detail and searing prose. This powerful story will loiter in my mind and already I have played wonderful You Tube videos of Interviews and ballet performances by by Rudolf and his partner Margot Fonten. ...more This is fiction, but based on the true life events of the famed Russian ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev (1938-1993). Through fiction the author attempts to show readers not only the external facts of Nureyev\u2019s life but also how he perceived his own life. We are not so much told his inner thoughts, motivations and feelings, but we watch what he does and follow the crazed, hyped celebrity life and the frenzied gay-scene that lead to his death by AIDS.

Through fiction the author attempts to show readers not only the external facts of Nureyev\u2019s life but also how he perceived his own life. We are not so much told his inner thoughts, motivations and feelings, but we watch what he does and follow the crazed, hyped celebrity life and the frenzied gay-scene that lead to his death by AIDS. He defected Russia in 1961. We see how this impacted his own life and the lives of those left behind. In this book we are shown, not told. What is shown to us is NOT pleasant. I am sure you know of his promiscuous behavior. There is sex and drugs aplenty. This is not a comforting read, no fairy tale. If that is what you want, then look elsewhere. We see Rudi\u2019 s life through the eyes of both those closest to him and those who only brushed shoulders with him, through famed entities such as Jacqueline Onassis, Andy Warhol, Truman Capote, Erik Buhn, Margot Fonteyn and through fictional characters too. There is no author\u2019s note stating explicitly what is fiction and what is fact, but I am convinced that Colum McCann has mirrored Nureyev\u2019s world accurately. I did shore up the facts by reading Wikipedia. I learned much through the fictional characters. They gave depth to the story; some of them I grew to love (Odil and Tom and Anna, to name but three.) Having read this book, I feel I have lived next to Nureyev through his childhood, all the way to his death, ending with a final auction of his possessions. Each episode had a message, none were superfluous. I found neither the sex nor his final illness too explicit; I felt the electricity in the air, the dizzying pace, his fight for perfection in his dance and the sensuality of ballet. Don\u2019t expect the life of a true artist to be anything but violent. The audiobook has five different narrators, named below. In one chapter the reader hops form one character to another, without warning, but I was never confused. The audiobook\u2019s narrators did not correspond to one specific character. You could not assume that if you heard one voice you knew which character was speaking sine there were many more characters than the five audiobook narrators. The only narrator I was not happy with was Jessica Almasy. Her voice was too sweet, too childish! All the others were great, and Suzanne Toren was f-a-n-t-a-s-t-i-c!!! Is she my favorite narrator? There is a brutal chapter filled with sex and drugs, read by one of the male narrators. That too, with its staccato pulse, perfectly created the world of Nureyev at that time. I believe that listening to the audiobook further enhances the reading experience. The tempo, the dialects, the intonations create an atmosphere that carries the reader beyond the written words. I feel I know now what moved, motivated and pushed Rudolph Nureyev. I feel I understand him. I pity him and I admire him. Both. When I look at his life I look at it with disgust and admiration. I think the author has done a tremendous job. The way Colum McCann has mixed fact with fiction is really amazing. Five stars. ******************** I have just begun my third book by Colum McCann. It won\u2019t be my last. I cannot get enough of his writing. It is fantastic. Why? Well, because he mixes the tragedy of life with humor and beauty. I have just experienced WW2 in Ufa, Russia. The horror of war is painted on a tableau. Next to this are also people laughing, the wonders of a warm bath, the glint of an eye and the sounds of a balalaika and singing. I can't take the horrors of the earlier tableau if I am not given the happiness too. I love seeing both so beautifully depicted one next to the other. Life IS beautiful if we just pay attention and look and listen and smell. What writing! Is this my favorite author? I am listening to an audiobook with superb narration by several narrators, men and women who expertly pronounce the Russian dialect. Their names are: Jonathan Davis, Nick Pauling, Jessica Almasy, Marc Vietor and Suzanne Toren. All of them are new to me except Suzanne Toren who did a great job narrating Ex Libris: Confessions of a Common Reader . I am so glad I have a long-listen ahead of me, more than 12hours. :0) ...more Very brisk and rather quickly read. I picked this up idly from a friend's bookcase after a night of drinking, since I love to sleep but don't like to surrender that easily, and got through the bulk of it in one extended recumbency (semester's over, not much to do, figure I'd tack another contemporary up while I've got the time). the narrative is ideally suited for this kind of thing.

McCann writes with some distinct, succinct, almost punchy sentences which follow each other so fluidly that the reader doesn't really notice how easily the pages are passing. the story is interesting for people (like me) who revel in tortured artist stories. Didn't know very much about Nureyev and now I'm curious. McCann makes what seems to be a somewhat exaggerated though essentially accurate portrait of the man- aggressive, sexy, willful, egocentric but with an equally irrefutable sensitivity and brutal sense of repressed loss. I was reminded of an anecdote I'd heard about Michaelangelo and how he loved to sculpt out of marble- the \"ecstasy\", as contrasted to \"agony\"- and the subsequent image of him as a workaholic who loved his studio and the rigors of the workshop, to say nothing of the final product. Nureyev seemed similar, and it was inspiring to read about his dedication matching his passion and perfectionism. You gotta love to practice, whatever you're doing, don't you? It might well be that whatever you find enjoyably challenging when working on- never mind finishing- might just be your calling. Screw the final product, or the pride of creation. If the moonlighting is fun for you, then you ought to think about sticking to it. Journey not the destination, blahblahblah.... All in all, a very solid story. At points McCann really hit his stride with a sort of deliberate stream of consciousness structure for \"Rudi\"'s semi-diary as his artistic perfection and public acclaim start to click into place. You really get the sense of what it would be like to be a touring performer, seen of course through Rudi's eyes specifically. The supporting cast of characters- his sensual dance partner Margot, Erik the possibly number 2 dancer in the world, who is also his anguished obscure object of desire, his teacher, his floundering, gradually desperate family snowed in under Soviet repression and totalitarian imprisonment, the bird-flipping 3 year exile Nureyev assumes when the word gets back from Paris that the great ballet dancer might be...um... a 'poofta', and the charismatic, sybaritic Venezuelan Victor, queen of the coke-sodden suckathon in 80's bathouse NYC who fades out dreaming of ultimate cock and shooting down his poisoned cells himself. The novel does veer into some sort of overdone, obvious metaphorizing, dangling over the precipice of \"Nice Writing\"...part of the reason the book moves so floatingly and reads so smoothly is precisely because it's nearly all surface. McCann literalizes so much of the narrative and the motivations for the characters that we know pretty much exactly what we're getting, moment by moment, move by move, word for word. It's not simplistic, really, it's more that the narrative it presented with surface detail which swerves from the more ingrained form of storytelling, which would be to let the diagesis do the talking. The \"show\" not the \"tell\", in the irritating and almost irrelevant phrasing of the fiction workshop. It's a surface which necessarily follows the complex, firey, and dynamic characters all right, and therefore expresses their humanity in more complicated forms than simple minimalism would, but for a large part what you see is what you get. It's easy to enjoy but doesn't really hit the kinds of depths which the best of fiction has to offer. The dancing is vivid, but its under glass. ...more I debated over 3 and 4 stars on this one. The result of reading this book is that I am now fascinated with Rudolf Nureyev, the man. After finishing the book, I was scouring the internet for more information. That alone is an indication that the book had a big impact on me. But there were parts of it that I didn't care for.

What I liked about the book is that is wasn't just about Rudy, it was also about the settings (Russia, Paris, New York), the time period (WWII, Studio 54, emergence of AIDS), and the people around him (Margot Fonteyn, Yulia, the daughter of his first ballet teacher Anna Vasileva, his sister, even his housekeeper and shoemaker). What I didn't like was that at times I was confused by who was speaking. This is the first time that I listened to a full cast in an audiobook, so at least the narrator changed with the different characters. But it wasn't clear who the character was. When Yulia first started telling her story, I was really confused. It would have been nice to have the monologue \"titled\" at the beginning of the section. Towards the middle to the end of the book, it became easier. One thing that I found interesting was that all of the characters spoke in first person POV except Margot Fonteyn. A male narrator spoke of her in third person POV. Even Rudy spoke for himself. I wonder about the significance of the change in POV for one character. ...more It's a fictional story about Soviet ballet dancer Rudolf Nurejev.

It just took me by surprise, McCann is a master with words and he knows how to spin a story. It all begins with soldiers coming home from WWII, and how they are bathed in Rudolfs home town of Ufa. It's glimpses out to the real world and they are shown through out the book. \"They looked out over the steppe and saw the bodies of fellow soldiers, a hand in the air, a knee in a stretch, beards frozen with frost, and they leaned to steal the dead man's clothes before he became stiffened in them, and they leaned in to whisper, Sorry comrade thanks for the tobacco.\" Rather then seeing the world through his eyes, we see the world around him through those of his friends, family, and strangers. And in the beginning through his eyes the sentences are short, like thoughts sometimes. He is so busy so he only thinks of the things he must do to get better. The thing I then love is the fact that we see the world though the eyes of others, not only what they think about him, but how they are feeling. Hungry, tired, loved, everything that is crucial in life. I truly enjoy these glimpses into their lives. Some are fictional and some of them are real. McCann is not afraid to show the real world, and not some glamour bubble around one of the worlds greatest dancers. Even though I do love this book, the end of the 3rd part and the 4th part gets tiresome. There is a lot of how he screwed everything that moved through out the 60's to the 80's. He really should be in sex addicts anonymous. Not to mention that is what killed him. Not explicit sex scenes no this is not that kind of book. But it's just so much, and it's so depressing. Still it's a lovely portrait of a man loved by ballet fans. McCann waves the fabric of his life into a wonderful tapestry which I highly recommend to all. He shows him to be what he was, arrogant and temperamental, still loved by all. They couldn't help it. ...more I guess I'm just over the let's-analyze-a-genius genre, and have been for a while.

I picked this up when it came across my desk at the bookstore, because I've loved other things McCann has written, but this . . . while it is undeniably beautifully written, and parts of it are quite compelling, it turns out he subject matter just didn't do it for me, and the main character -- real-life ballet superstar Rudolf Nureyev -- is such an irredeemable jackass that I had a hard time really caring about him. I feel like \"he's a GENIUS, you know, and therefore we excuse his excesses!\" is an old trope with which I long ago grew tired. Given the way Nureyev died, the book was bound to have a depressingly typical ending for a story about a gay man who lived through the 70s and 80s at the peak of his fame and sexual prowess. The book wisely treads lightly over this topic, but still, it has been done so many times that I'm a little bored even by the hint of it. I realize that (A) the reason so many stories about gay men end this way is because so many lives of gay men ended this way in the 80s and 90s, and (B) McCann doesn't want to just pretend that Nureyev didn't die or something, but it's still ground that's been covered enough times that I'm not that interested in pursuing it anymore. The book has many, many merits, and its most compelling sections deal with Nureyev hardly at all, but more with the lives of ordinary Russians and Uzbeks in Kruschev's Soviet Union. McCann retains his usual excellence at inhabiting the heads and hearts of disparate people, from Soviet dance instructors to Venezuelan hustlers, and the story's third-person sections display the same chilling eye for the devastating detail that he displayed in Let the Great World Spin . But for a book that is meant to be a portrait of an explosive and passionate man, it is strange that its most effective passages would be the muted and cold ones that draw pictures of those considerably more ordinary (and less obnoxious) than the putative main character. ...more Colum McCann actually wrote an entire chapter without a period! Now, that takes guts. Before you call the MLA police, let me at least say that it was effective and created a fabulous tone for the coked-up hustler of whom the chapter revolved. That being said, he also chose to go in and out of first and third person narrative and changed narrators often and sometimes without provocation or notice. This wasn't as successful in my opinion.

I only say that because I get confused easily...I'm a blonde. You, however, may find it intriguing and cool. I can only trust my instincts about half the time anyway, so feel free to disagree. I don't, however, want that to cloud the fact that Colum McCann has a true gift of creating voice and mood within the text. It had a real feeling of honest storytelling that I really appreciated. The story revolves around Rudi Nureyev, the famous Russian ballet phenom who defected in 1961. The book gives an account not only of Nureyev, but the people intertwined in his complicated life both in Russia and the west. Through journal-like accounts and descriptive outside perspective writing styles, you get to know his first ballet teacher, his ballet shoe maker, his dance partners, his housekeeper, his best friend, and others equally. I can't say McCann made our \"hero\", Nuryev, a terribly sympathetic character. His temper, his eccentricities, and his bouts with an undiagnosed depressive disorder made him somewhat of a stock character (I'm kind of over the tortured artist thing in books...and life). I guess I just wish I knew maybe a little more about why he was the way he was. It kind of popped out of nowhere and fed into the folk legend of Nuryev's Studio 54 lifestyle. Meh, okay, I get it...he hung out with Andy Warhol and Truman Capote...okay, who didn't? So, yes, I liked it. Mostly, due to the descriptiveness of the scenery, the authenticity of the humanity within the characters, and originality of style. Didn't change my life, but it's a good read. ...more En biografi av Rudolf Nurejev-en av alla tiders st\u00f6rsta balettdans\u00f6rer, eller snarare en roman om Nurejevs liv och konst.

All of the characters are richly detailed. I enjoy the constant shift of perspective and different style of writing that McCann employs to amplify each character's personality and point of view. Similar to Let the Great World Spin, McCann totally captures a slice of NYC in the 70s - a close friend and mentor of mine came out in 1977 and McCann's descriptions of the Rambles, the bath houses, and the general carefree wild sex of the time and place brought back so many memories and stories from my friend's life.

These are the things I wanted to know. While there were many interesting parts, I found that the book generally dragged a bit and I found myself expecting more depth. Perhaps I'm unfairly comparing everything McCann writes to his most recent book, Let the Great World Spin....now that was an amazing book.

McCann mixes first and third person narrative passages very effectively, bordering them with information from the historical record (although - as you can tell from the opening page which lists things thrown onstage during Nureyev's first Paris season - dance happily crosses the line between legend and history). The first person passages are from people peripheral to Nureyev's story (I suppose some of them of them are complete fabrications) - they are all very interesting characters. And they arouse sympathy, although they are less difficult people than Nureyev, so that reaction isn't really much of a surprise. I liked the kaleidoscope effect very much - it really enriched the story. Although I think a more straightforward historical novel would also have been interesting (and containing its own challenges). 3.

He is born out of violence and brought up during wartime. In the 60's he defects to Paris and news of his promiscuous, homosexual lifestyle was sent back home to his remaining family in order to smear his god-like status and dancing ability. He was beloved forever, but he never loved anyone. Rudik was an animal, freed out of democratic-socialism. Those left behind in the USSR were animals too, only they were caged and herded. In the rest of the world Rudik danced like none other, bought art, fucked everyone he could find, and stretched every morning. He wore fine clothes and ate good food. Never once did he worry about money. The world was his oyster, and he ate it. He chewed it up and spat it out. He spat out everyone. What else is there to do if one is a god among men? You can do anything and have anyone. ...more Colum McCann's Dancer is a thinly fictionalized biography of the great Russian ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev, narrated by dozens of different people (some real, some fictional) who knew Nureyev at various points in his life.

Nureyev was a fascinating and notorious man, but of course, the reason anyone cares about his life wasn't just that he was really good-looking and per Richard Avedon, hung like a horse :P It's that he was one of the great ballet dancers of the 20th century and one of the greatest ever, if reviews and YouTube are to be believed. Unfortunately, conveying his unique abilities as a dancer is a very difficult thing to do in prose (hundreds of pages of a book won't give you nearly as good a sense of Nureyev's capabilities as a five minute video!) And even a writer as brilliant as Colum McCann doesn't manage to make that leap; Nureyev himself remains curiously flat in the sections narrated from his POV. But the parts of the novel set in Russia are phenomenal, right from the opening which sums up the terrible experience of World War II in Russia in five pages of limpid prose and vivid imagery. For all its flaws, Dancer is worth reading simply for those five pages and for the story of Nureyev's (fictional) first ballet teacher, her husband and their daughter. ...more I thought this was going to be about Nureyev, the great dancer/cheographer; instead it was mostly about his promiscuity and gay lifestyle.

There is a brief description of early dance lessons and ascent of Rudolf as dancer and his subsequent defection...but from then on you are given to believe his life is one orgy after another. After awhile I really became disgusted with the graphic sexual exploits of the gay community in all the neighborhoods of NYC or any other place he might be. I hated the character of Victor....he came across as a pathetic caricature. Where was the creativity and passion that Nureyev had for his art. He was with Margot Fonteyn for nearly 2 decades...so little of her. And of his choreography.. All the aspects of a Great Dancer. Some of the details of his life were correct...for others there was significant artisitc license applied. His personality was believable. The book disappointed me..except for the historical parts relating to Russian life under commmunism If this was all the author could come up with in order to write a meaningful,creative or accurate story of Nureyev's life...then he fell short. I think I need to read another biography of the dancer. ...more Dancer is amongst my most favourite books of all time.

With that said, I have read all of Colum McCann's books and he continues to impress with his opulent writing style, evocative detail and his astounding explorations of hidden corners of the human experience. This is a fictional story, largely based on the life of one of the most celebrated ballet dancers of the 20th century - Rudolph Nureyev. The cinematographic strokes that McCann writes in paint such a vivid picture in the reader's mind, that one cannot help but feel completely involved in the story. I was also absolutely impressed how McCann, as an Irish-American writer, had been able to capture the essence of the Soviet soul and inner turmoil of the characters in such a precise manner. I have never heard of non-Russian writer being able to do this to accurately. The overall theme is about s yearning for freedom and recovery, and McCann brilliantly narrates Nureyev's story through his vivid characters, writing style and the many points of view he artfully uses to bring the story to life. ...more As the 3 stars say, I \"liked it\". I'm definitely ambivalent about fiction based on people who lived so recently; at least McCann had the decency to change the names of people still living (basically turning it into a bit of a roman-a-clef, whether he planned it that way or not), but I noticed that by and large the really major figures in the Western ballet world didn't get much more than an indirect word or two.

Possibly they or their ferociously protective estates (Balanchine?) deterred the author from getting too much into real ballet gossip. A pity, perhaps. The writing is, as pretty much everyone agrees, superb; the frequent change of narrative POV keeps the reader hopping, but that's OK. The stream-of-consciousness \"Victor\" segment depicting Nureyev's life amongst the upper crust - and the gay bathhouses - in the US, is breathtaking. The opening evocation of the horrors of WWII in Russia will stick with me for a long time. I wonder how many of the allusions about Nureyev himself I would have picked up had I not recently read a Nureyev biography; and I also wonder whether it would have mattered. ...more An advantage of the bad weather is the opportunity to finally finish this book; and a great excuse to neglect the growing list of jobs my wife manages to create with apparent ease.

McCann\u2019s sharp vivid descriptions kept me reading, rather than abandoning yet another book; which would be destined for my local charity shop unread. I\u2019m sure anyone who is a fan or Nureyev or dance would rate this as a \u2018Must Read\u2019. Regardless of what the text on the back jacket implies; \u2018The Dancer\u2019 is more of a slow Waltz or Foxtrot instead of the Moon Walk or Break dance we were promised...

Instead, it is more of an insight on how we each choose to live our lives and whether we're happy with our choices or regretful about them. Just some items to be aware of: During the middle of the book there are long, detailed sections describing explicit gay sexual encounters. Also, McCann uses different grammatical & literary techniques, i.e., no quotation marks, a run-on sentence which went for 36 pages without a period, frequent point-of-view switches, random thoughts. The story was so fascinating and the writing was so solid that I wasn't bothered by the sex or variations of writing, but it's something you should know before diving in! ...more It was difficult to rate this book as it was fictionalized story of Nureyev life. I learned a lot, maybe things I already knew but forget. The outcome is I will read the true autobiography and never forget this book. Colum is a great writer makes you feel cold and gray of Russia, blue water and sky of the sea and attendance at the ballet. Colum McCann's novel on the life of Rudolf Nureyev, one of the most famous and lauded ballet dancers of the twentieth century, brings the biographical and the fictional into an intimate embrace. We begin in the hellish snow-covered battlefields of the Second World War and over the course of 333 pages watch Rudi as he grows up in the struggle-ridden landscape of Cold War-era Communist Russia.

We begin in the hellish snow-covered battlefields of the Second World War and over the course of 333 pages watch Rudi as he grows up in the struggle-ridden landscape of Cold War-era Communist Russia. His discovery, learning, and eventual mastery of ballet are a beautiful evolution, as is his transformation from a precocious boy and an insufferable, ingenious teenager to the veritable lord of the dance he became in manhood. The journey is kept interesting with the use of multiple narrators: Rudi's father, his mother, his sister, the old couple who teach him ballet, their daughter, his lovers, his cook. It's a kaleidoscopic perspective, but you need it, for Nureyev was a kaleidoscopic man. McCann writes this life story so beautifully I wish I could call it a biography; when I was about forty pages from the end I looked up Nureyev on Wikipedia (having never heard of him before). I can honestly say I felt as though I had known the man already by virtue of simply having read \"Dancer.\" The story is that rich. And oh my god, the prose. I don't know how McCann does it, but it's dauntingly beautiful. Practically every other line or description is something you'd want to highlight or write down just so you could read it a thousand more times. He adopts a strikingly distinct voice for the nearly dozen narrators/characters that appear in the novel. By the time you've finished reading what they say and see and do, you feel as if each of them has personally handed over their very being for you to carry around with you for the rest of your life. One particular source of surprise is a portion where we hear from Victor, a Venezuelan hustler and one of Rudi's closest friends. In all the thirty or so pages Victor is allowed to narrate, McCann doesn't use a single period. In conclusion, you'll feel exhausted after reading this novel; it's as though you personally stood backstage through all the worldwide performances, the ovations, the political turmoil, the beginnings and endings of Rudi's relationships, and all the beauty. And just give McCann the Pulitzer already.... ...more Kolams Makkens ir sarakst\u012bjis vienreiz\u0113ju un aizraujo\u0161u st\u0101stu \u201eDejot\u0101js\u201d, kur\u0161 ir aizr\u0101vis daudzu las\u012bt\u0101ju sirdis.

This is truly an engrossing, often mesmerizing, exploration of the dancer's life as seen through the eyes of his family and friends from his childhood to the end of an artistically triumphant life tragically cut short by AIDS. The son of impoverished Muslim Tatar peasants, we meet the young \"Rudik\" dancing for Russian troops in the waning days of World War II. His teachers in his hometown and then later, in Lenningrad, recognize that here is someone who is destined to dance, culminating with his admittance into the company of Lenningrad's celebrated Kirov Ballet. His Paris defection only leads the young Rudolf Nureyev into scaling Mount Everests of international artistic triumphs, culminating with his dancing with acclaimed ballerina Margot Fonteyn at London's Covent Garden. But perhaps more fascinating is the dark side of Nureyev's personality, which McCann has captured vividly, showing the artist's arrogance and decadent behavior, including his brutal treatment of friends, colleagues and especially, lovers, such as acclaimed fellow dancer Erik Buhn. We see him sink into the seedy underground of New York City's homosexual-dominated sexual pleasure industry in the 1970s, while managing to keep his homosexuality a closely held secret. I concur completely with my former high school teacher Frank McCourt's glowing assessment of \"Dancer\" on the novel's book jacket as having \"... the wingspan of a great Russian novel, which is only fitting for an imagined life of Rudolf Nureyev.\" ...more A fictionalized portrait of the life of a legendary artist, saturated with name dropping and gossipy embellishments, and with the fluid urgency of a page-turner, but largely failing to explore his actual art.

Seemed gratuitous and irrele A fictionalized portrait of the life of a legendary artist, saturated with name dropping and gossipy embellishments, and with the fluid urgency of a page-turner, but largely failing to explore his actual art.

Seemed gratuitous and irrelevant to the story, not to mention it's been done to death many times over in other contexts. Yet, this is a pretty good read. The chapters about Nureyev's upbringing in rural Russia and humble beginnings as an overaged student at the Leningrad Vaganova Academy are beautifully written and by far the most compelling part of the story. Also, this first half of the book is populated by a rich gallery of interesting characters that you keep wanting to learn more about. Much of the shallow-ish account of Nureyev's decadent life in the West is interspersed with brisk snippets of how these characters -- his family and friends in Russia -- coped with the (often terrifying) aftermath of his defection. Their quiet and unassuming perspective, told in constantly shifting narrative, serves as a well-needed contrast to all the jet setting and debauchery. However, I would have loved to also delve a little deeper into Nureyev's life and motivations as a dancer, which annoyingly had to take a backseat to other more salacious material. I will probably go pick up Julie Kavanagh's biography to see if it paints a more complete picture of this fascinating (but repulsive) man. ...more Colum McCann is a brilliant Irish writer who, fortunately for his readers, is a compassionate, vivid and above all, wonderfully adept at bringing his characters to a wonderful life. \"Dancer\"if a biography, to my knowledge, McCann's first, Back in the early 60's., the first Russian ballet dancer to defect away from the dead cultural life of the 50's-60's Soviet Union, Rudolph Nureyev.

Rudy was desperately, dirt poor, but despite everything he had going against him. Rudy's passion and unlimited talent allowed him to become the most famous male dancer in classical ballet. But the Kirov, the world famous ballet institution in St. Petersberg, Leningrad, and Stalingrad (all the same city - they change the name frequently.) was caught in a time warp, and would only perform old, classical ballet, with the same steps, and the same choreography that they'd used for many, many years. Such a dancer as Nureyev, and, following him, Mikail Barishniknov, both defected for artistic freedom. The danger to Nureyev was much worse - he had to leave his family in Russia., and this was when everyone toed the Party line. This book is alive with the pulsing passion of the best of ballet. Virtually impossible injuries from incredible physical feats. McCann doesn't gloss over Nureyev's flagrant homosexuality, and his imperative temperament. Nor does he skimp on the incredible beauty of Margot Fonteyn, the leading ballerina of her time, and their matchless duets. Fonteyn was 20 yrs older than Rudy, but the two of them made matchless dancing a part of the history of this art. ...more This book's sense of time and place pulled me in, right from the start.

Instead it describes the turmoil and fear his defection caused among his family and friends still living in the only partially \"thawed\" USSR. Similarly, it doesn't go through the details of his performances. The reader is supposed to know already who Erik and Margot were, because the book picks up with those relationships (parties, fights, etc.) when they're already well established. Fantastic writing. Like a ballet, this book has movements. Most of it is conventional narrative, although the perspective changes without warning or explanation. One movement is the impressionistic series of lists and vignettes and jotted notes--this is our glimpse into Nureyev's mind. Another movement is a whole chapter written as one sentence. A little challenging, a little unconventional. This scratched my Russia itch. ...more<---C>Colum McCann</---C>", "Title": "Dancer"},
