Next I was in the head of a neighbor boy, who is just coming home, the many, many rules of his insanely controlling parents ringing in his ears. Then someone else, someone with bad intentions, arrives in the neighborhood, and I was in his head, too. There's a \"call to adventure\" that reminded me of Joseph Campbell. In the last story, a man with a brain tumor decides to spare his family his own long, torturous death by going outside in 10 degree weather and dying of exposure. But there's someone else out there, a pretty hapless kid, with his own crazy narrative playing in his head. I liked that the first story was a call to action, and the last story was a call to acceptance. The stories in the middle, seven of them, are all interesting and worth reading, but those stories at the beginning and end are the ones I will remember for a long, long time. And I find Saunders' ability to get you right into the heads of his characters extraordinary. ...more You know those disconcerting dreams where nothing you can do will seem right; lose-lose propositions are the only ones on offer?

Well George Saunders is the large deluxe pizza you ate before bed. He's the likely culprit. I started with a comment about Saunders himself because his stories, and collections in general, are hard to review. Plot summaries don\u2019t really work because there are too many of them. Unifying themes aren\u2019t always easy to come by either. Even if there are common threads, they\u2019re often obscured, as though anything obvious would go against the short fiction writers' creed. Which brings me to another point. Might it often be more accurate to call a \u201cshort\u201d story a \u201ctruncated\u201d story instead? They\u2019re not so much whole stories that happen to be short as much as ones that might have been whole but were lopped off \u2013 skipping background, transitions, and even endings. But that can make them fun puzzles to solve. Any discomfort we get from our fragmented look can be included in that all-important category of conflict . But none of this helps the reviewer. Yet, hard as it may be to frame, this book is crying out for a discussion. I think it\u2019s fair to say that Saunders is the flavor of the month. When the NY Times Magazine features an article called \u201cGeorge Saunders Has Written the Best Book You\u2019ll Read This Year,\u201d we can assume there\u2019s a buzz about him in Lit World. Those familiar with his past work applaud this one for its greater realism. It still has absurd elements, but each story is allowed to find its most natural, relatable way to be told. Wasn\u2019t there some famous sculptor who said he never knew what object would come from a big chunk of marble until he started chipping away to find out? The more mature Saunders evidently has less use for surrealism and I suspect his empathy is more apparent when his people seem more real. Having read only a few of his stories before this, I can only speculate. His style may have evolved, but his targets have not. He\u2019s still the class warrior he always was. That said, I never found his characters to be pat. For instance, I don\u2019t think he equated being poor with being noble or right, rather, just people to be pitied. To Saunders, capitalism is hard, with a whole range of possibilities within the construct. In an interview, he was thinking back on his own leaner times and said, \u201cthe cumulative effect of an absence of wealth was the erosion of grace.\u201d As a younger man he was an Ayn Rand acolyte. When he fell away, he fell hard and it politicized him. It makes the piece he wrote for the New Yorker , posing as Rand\u2019s former young lover, all the more prickly as a satire. His liberal sentiments are well-established, but he can surprise us with human tendencies at odds with them. For instance, one story called \u201cSemplica Girls\u201d came to him in a dream. He said in the linked interview, \u201cI went to a window that didn\u2019t exist in our house, and I looked into the yard, and I saw a row of what I understood in the dream logic to be third-world women who had a wire through their heads,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of horror, my reaction was like, \u2018Yeah, we did it.\u2019 Just like if you\u2019d gotten a new car or a kid into school or something, that feeling of, I\u2019ve come such a long way, I\u2019m able to give these things to my family. And there was a sense that there was an alleviated shame.\u201d If I were to point to a common element in these stories, I\u2019d say that they\u2019re good at maximizing our discomfort. They do their damnedest to pose moral dilemmas. We\u2019re led to a point where we want to judge, but can\u2019t quite do it. There but for the grace of good fortune goes the reader \u2013 a statement that speaks to the compassion that Saunders elicits. My favorite story, the title piece that was put at the end, was somewhat of a contrast to the moral quandaries that preceded it. An unpopular schoolboy was walking home lost in a reverie, casting himself as a hero to impress a girl, when he encountered a coatless man in the snow who was hoping to front-run a death decreed by cancer. Preferred courses of action were clear, and they were ennobling. It was a nice note to end on. Humanity scored a clear winner for once. I\u2019ll close with a reference to a conversation Saunders had at one time with DFW, J. Franzen and B. Marcus on the topic of the ultimate aspirations of fiction. (How many of us would gladly have been maggots on the molding of that room?) \u201cThe thing on the table was emotional fiction. How do we make it? How do we get there? Is there something yet to be discovered? These were about the possibly contrasting desire to: (1) write stories that had some sort of moral heft and/or were not just technical exercises or cerebral games; while (2) not being cheesy or sentimental or reactionary.\u201d I\u2019m not sure this collection met the goal completely, but I could tell that it tried. Let\u2019s give him credit for that. ...more One of the stories in this collection features experimental drugs that can enhance someone\u2019s verbal ability to describe an event.

At a basic level, there are ten short stories that reminded me somewhat of Kurt Vonnegut because Saunders uses sci-fi concepts and humor in several of them to depict various aspects of human nature, but this has some nastier edges than you\u2019d usually find in Vonnegut\u2019s more melancholy tone. I enjoyed almost all of them, but there are three stand outs. Escape From Spiderhead features a genuinely disturbing account of a prisoner being used an experimental subject for various drugs that can be used to make someone fall instantly into love or hit a suicidal depth of despair within moments. Victory Lap is about a young man whose behavior has been so dictated by his parents that he finds himself almost paralyzed as he witnesses a neighbor girl being abducted. Exhortation is written as a message from a corporate middle manager urging his people to do a better job that takes a sinister turn. There are similar characters and ideas brought up in a several of the stories like a dystopian future with a corporate layer of bullshit laid on top of it. Both Spiderhead and My Chivalric Fiasco have drugs that can modify behavior to extreme lengths. Prominent characters are poor and stupid like Al Roosten and the narrator of The Semplica Girl Diaries . The only one I didn\u2019t care for was the very short Sticks about a man whose yard decorations get increasingly bizarre. That one seemed more gimmick than story. ...more My second foray into Saunders after a lukewarm response to Pastoralia was an unprecedented success.

Or maybe they sent in their effusive paragraphs but the publishers had enough by then and they didn't make the cut. I think this irritation at having our taste and opinions herded around makes some people burst out with denunciations of The Beatles or Shakespeare or David Foster Wallace, it's like artistic Tourette's syndrome, I do sympathise with such victims. <+++>Tenth of December</+++> is stuffed with at least seven great short stories, really the only one I didn't love immoderately was the title track, so Mr Saunders gets an obedient baaaa!, baaa! from me. ...more Saunders is not for me; he is cut from a cloth that I cannot comfortably wear. I would categorize him with Pynchon, Eggers, Donald Barthelme, de Lillo, David Foster Wallace, Thom Jones, and Ward Just.

Little touches of sci fi or magic realism -- no matter how minute -- always annoy me. The fault lies in my own taste, I concede. I am not edgy or indy. I am not cutting edge. I am not \"au courant\" and could perfectly happily reread Dickens and Trollope forever. I am certain that I am not the reading public that most authors seek preferment from. I really liked the end of the acknowledgements when he said that somewhere in his youth or childhood he must have done something good.

I wanted to read this book because of a fantastic article written about Saunders in The New York Times earlier this year.* That article references a lovely convocation speech he gave, in which he advocates for treating others more kindly: \"What I regret most in my life are failures of kindness. Those moments when another human being was there, in front of me, suffering, and I responded\u2026sensibly. Reservedly. Mildly. \"Or, to look at it from the other end of the telescope: Who, in your life, do you remember most fondly, with the most undeniable feelings of warmth? Those who were kindest to you, I bet. \"It\u2019s a little facile, maybe, and certainly hard to implement, but I\u2019d say, as a goal in life, you could do worse than: Try to be kinder.\" *You can read the NYT article here: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/mag... ...more Three stars???

Maybe it is that it has been so long since his last collection was released that I felt there should be something more here. I did like all of the stories, none of them were groan worthy but none of them really stood out either. Maybe I'll revise this opinion later when I find that some bit of one of the stories has planted itself in my brain and I find myself turning over memories of the story. In case you don't read all my reviews let me say again, I hate reviewing short story collections. I'm also not really a fan of the short story. In musical terms too often they are like guitar solos, something that people with less philistine tastes than mine probably appreciate for their technical bravado, but which usually leave me feeling little for (although I can't think of any guitar solo that I like, or which I can say has 'rocked my world', the same can not be said of short stories. I do like quite a few of them, I know though that I've forgotten all the details about many many more of them then the ones that have left me with some residual mental reminder). Reading George Saunders you get the feeling that he is a very humane person. He wants to see the world as good and he has actual compassion for people. Even when he's writing about degenerate white-trash there is a warmth to him. I almost wonder if he is like one of the characters in his first story, Alison Pope, whose thoughts ramble on how much she loves her town and people in her town, and in a high school ethics class poll, \"voted for people being good and life being fun, with Mrs. Dees giving her a pitying glance as she stated her views: To do good, you just have to decide to do good. You have to be brave. You have to stand up for what's right. At that last, Mrs. Dees had made this kind of groan. Which was fine. Mrs. Dees had a lot of pain in her life, yet, interterestingly? Still obviously found something fun about life and good about people, because otherwise why sometimes stay up so late grading you come in next day all exhausted, blouse on backward, having messed it up in the early-morning dark, you dead discombobulated thing?\" I get the feeling he would like to have this view of people, but then real life comes as the unexpected knock to the back door. Delusions are present in almost all of the stories. The stories characters tell themselves in their heads, and the selves they create for themselves don't necessarily have anything to do with the way they really are. Other stories feature peoples inner selves being tweeked, modified or fucked up by fancy named pharmaceuticals. Violence runs through many of the stories, but it is rarely ever seen on the page. These are just a few themes I'm rambling off on. The collection reminded me quite a bit of Hot Pink by Adam Levin. Probably taken as a whole the stories are better, but none of the stories really take off like Levin's did in his handful of spectacular pieces. In reality both books probably deserve four stars, but for my own reasons one gets bumped up and the other down. Maybe it's that as a first collection Levin's was really good, and for Saunders I'm kind of hoping that he'll do something more, my expectations are higher. Not that the stories are bad or anything, they are good, but they always feel like a George Saunders story, which is a compliment when applied to other writers but I'm kind of hoping to see something more from him. It would seem that some of the younger writers out there are quite possibly working his terrain in ways that are a bit more satisfying than he's doing it himself. ...more when did george saunders become so well known? i don't mean that to sound snarky - i am honestly astonished (and delighted) by the lavish attention tenth of december has been getting. i count george saunders high on my list of favorite living authors, but for the longest time i labored under the apparently woefully misguided assumption that he was unjustly unknown and unfeted (despite his regular appearances in the new yorker et al.). i was all set to write a magnum opus of a goodreads review in when did george saunders become so well known? i don't mean that to sound snarky - i am honestly astonished (and delighted) by the lavish attention tenth of december has been getting. i count george saunders high on my list of favorite living authors, but for the longest time i labored under the apparently woefully misguided assumption that he was unjustly unknown and unfeted (despite his regular appearances in the new yorker et al.). i was all set to write a magnum opus of a goodreads review in order to lift him out of the literary genteel poverty (i assumed) he was languishing in, only to find out that places like the new york times magazine have been feting him all along. then again, there are pieces like this one that seem to suggest that a lot of the hype is rather self-contained and perhaps smacking a bit of snobbery. i dunno. he is worth the hype, though. that i do know. apologies for the constant linking, but in reading this latest collection i kept thinking of this article and the really astute and compassionate way it talks about disaster in relation to social difference. as the author points out, people often think of disasters as flattening out landscapes, but in fact what they also do is deepen and reinforce existing inequalities (of class, gender, race, place). i've realized this is why i react with such immediate loathing when confronted with the superflat art of murakami takashi, to give just one example. his superflat art presents a slick world of utter surface in which we (as global consumers) are supposedly all on the same plane. but we're not. as george saunders shows, we are positioned in a vastly uneven landscape in which only those at the top can live in a superflat world as if nothing was at stake. but that's only a trick of perspective, as evidenced by all those left gazing up from the ruts and grooves made invisible by it. everything is at stake. a lot of the stories in this collection feature characters from both ends of the chasm brought unexpectedly together, with bizarrely surreal and melancholic and yet also simply really funny results. but what i love about george saunders (and this is true of many things i love) is that, while he deals with a lot of topics that can easily invoke cynicism and a certain kind of literary conceit (not to mention any names JEFFREY EUGENIDES), he himself is never, ever cynical. i can't even begin to do this book the justice it deserves. stories like \"tenth of december\" punch me in the gut, they leave me speechless and just...feeling like the world has opened up again, or like i've been plunged into the chasm, or like i've spent all day beating my fists against invisible walls that suddenly swing away and next i know i'm leaping into the sky. ah, hell. it's impossible to describe the effect of these stories. just read them. they are truly marvelous. ...more It is quite something to come across a writer of versatility and skill who doesn\u2019t figure (now that they have your ear\u2014you bought the book, didn\u2019t you?) they will add more than they need just because they can.

We may say that his stories do not have the language of the old masters, but they have the language we use, with more kindness, generosity of spirit, and humor mixed in than most of us can rustle up on an ordinary day. In the \u201cAfterword\u201d to Although Of Course You End up Becoming Yourself , an extended interview with David Foster Wallace by David Lipsky writing for Rolling Stone magazine, Lipsky says of Wallace\u2019s style that he wrote \u201cthe stuff you semi-thought, the background action you blinked through at supermarkets and commutes.\u201d You heard it, you know it, but it doesn\u2019t register enough for you to articulate and consider. Wallace was able to do that, and Saunders does it also. He reaches in and gets that real thing that you discarded, shines it, and shows you how it defines us. If I could ask him, I would ask Saunders how he chose which stories to include in this volume. He spans the range of us, starting out in the mind of suburban teenagers looking at each other with longing or appraisal ( \"Victory Lap\" ), and ends with a gentleman of great age descending the staircase of dementia to his grave ( \"<+++>Tenth of December</+++> \"). In between we catch glimpses of ourselves as returning soldiers filled with anger and hope ( \"Home\" ), twenty-somethings undergoing moral and medical testing ( \"Escape from Spiderhead\" ), and middle-aged parents aching to give their children more than they themselves had growing up ( \"The Semplica Girl Diaries\" ). Saunders is funny, kind, precise with his sword-thrusts which reach the heart but do not kill. I do not think we need ask \u201cwhere do you get your inspiration?\u201d since echoes of Mao Zedong ring through \"Exhortation\" , and we also know the zany neighbor in \"Sticks\" , or can imagine the source of the internal dialogue in \"My Chivalric Fiasco\" . These people are us, and he treats us gently and allows us to laugh, with regret sometimes, with recognition at other times. But he doesn\u2019t laugh at us and we don\u2019t laugh with cynicism. We are grateful to Saunders because, despite his pointing out our failings and our shortcomings, we can sense he still likes us, and even celebrates our efforts in trying to make sense of, and make our way in, this crazy world. I have too many favorite bits to single one out. But perhaps after all, my favorite bit is the fact that he doesn\u2019t use too many words. It is honed and toned and polished and clear and gets to the heart of the matter. It isn\u2019t a long book, so you can easily find your own favorite bit. It\u2019s all good. Go out and buy it. This is one you will want to reread: you will read it when you are happy, and you will read it when you are sad, you will read to see how he did that. ...more \u201cThe Tenth of December\u201d by George Saunders was published in 2013 to quite a bit of fanfare.

Some of the stories border in that realm between horror and weird and science fictional and fantasy and are all highly readable and most compelling.

I wanted to read it (expand my view --see if maybe I've 'matured' in taste) -- Overall I had a few laughs -- most of the stories were dark --(I found hard to find funny) --and I don't think I've matured at all. My mind drifted - (I had to 'work' to bring it back)-- Its seems there was less character storytelling & character development than storytelling of ideas. I still give the book a 3 (not less) --for the pure artistry I observed from the author. When this book was released in January of this year I heard that one reviewer proclaimed it the \"best book of the year.\" I guess there's some wisdom in some circumstances to not have very high expectations, like when anticipating the accomplishments of the latest election winnners, but certainly the contemporary publishing industry in this country and world is still turning out enough remarkable writing, that we can at least be hopeful throughout the year. Unfortunately this is not one of those When this book was released in January of this year I heard that one reviewer proclaimed it the \"best book of the year.\" I guess there's some wisdom in some circumstances to not have very high expectations, like when anticipating the accomplishments of the latest election winnners, but certainly the contemporary publishing industry in this country and world is still turning out enough remarkable writing, that we can at least be hopeful throughout the year. Unfortunately this is not one of those remarkable writings. Most of these stories are bland and uninteresting. The writing is choppy and unfocused. Much of it is simply short curt phrases, and not many complete sentences. It's true that people often speak like that in this world where many do not seem to have the time to construct complete sentences on electronic media via Facebook, e-mail, etc. It might be possible to imitate that in literature and turn it into an art form, but this book fails to do so. The best story in it is the second one, and that one is only two pages long. I haven't read any of Saunder's other writings, and based on this, his latest, I probably won't make much effort to check out this earlier books. ...more I wanted to like this one more than I did. I had never heard of the author until a friend recommended him; I then found his name popping up a lot as I read this collection. Saunders is a current literary darling, specializing in short stories, and has been generally very well-received. Tenth of December is a collection of ten short stories.

Saunders is a current literary darling, specializing in short stories, and has been generally very well-received. Tenth of December is a collection of ten short stories. Length varies dramatically, from a couple of pages to much longer. Saunders has been praised for his style; initially I took it to be a conceit of one of his characters, but it's pretty consistent across the board. I liked it more when I thought it was character specific. As the pages went on it began to grow stale. Saunders' wit is supposedly his trademark. The three people who eventually recommended him to me all found him funny; I rarely did. I compare him to David Sedaris. Many people think David Sedaris is hilarious; I have a hard time getting past the dysfunction, so instead of making me laugh, Sedaris bums me out. I think something similar might be at work here. I frequently found Saunders depressing, and there wasn't an adequate payoff to make the experience feel worth it. Not that I didn't like any of them; a few were very good. By and large, though, I didn't enjoy most of my time with Saunders.

A quick look at my updates will reveal that I liked more of the stories than I disliked. There were a couple I loved, but of a couple I felt the emperor was wearing no clothes -- though evidenced by the language in the stories I liked, it's obvious he can write well. The theme of American classism runs through most of the stories, with the 'haves' (those with a ridiculous amount of too-much) living near the 'have-nots' (some are working poor; some have 'enough,' even more than enough, though they compare themselves to the former). For any short-story lovers out there, try to read at least the title story: it's perfect. ...more My first experience with Saunders was quite an adventure. Other than a few stories which I didn't even understand, this collection was really stunning. The book deserves five stars on the sole basis of a few stories, especially the title story at the end, which was simply unforgettable and haunting. Saunders' stylistic genius is without question and his psychological depiction of our daily moral choices is fantastic. A literary tour-de-force. There are small cracks in life which go unnoticed or avoided by the general lot of humanity. Little crevices that are perfect mixtures of bliss and sorrow, wunderkinds that jolt one into a sense of appreciation, bewilderment, wonder at this thing called life.

Little crevices that are perfect mixtures of bliss and sorrow, wunderkinds that jolt one into a sense of appreciation, bewilderment, wonder at this thing called life. George Saunders\u2019 collection of stories delves into these wells to produce emotions from the very depths of being. His stories show the good in places where we fail to find it, stories of compassion to people who we condemn, stories of the unappreciated given their due. He gives voice to those we do not hear. I have not read an author with a deeper sense of humanity, with more compassion and understanding. What amazes me is that he achieves this with his style suggesting otherwise. There were more than a handful of times where I experienced fits of uncontrollable laughter, a great portion I had a stupid grin on my face. Of course, there were a great many parts where my emotion was stirred. One cannot help but admire the stealthy juxtaposition of feeling in these stories. There were times when the line between sadness and joy was blurred, moments when you cannot distinguish what you felt, moments of being. Saunders writes in an oddly adventurous prose, seemingly impersonal yet deeply perceptive in meaning, playful yet strangely insightful. I am taken aback, amazed by such ability, amazed by the power of language. The title story, the last one, left an impression that evoked tears. That rarely happens. But this collection is not perfect; some stories are stronger than others. But, then again, nothing is perfect. Life is not perfect. Some moments are happy, some are sad, some rarely, magnificently are both. We need them altogether. ...more Saunders is a master at taking the ordinary, the usual, the hum-drum and tossing in a bit of bizarro (okay...in some cases, it's a whole lot of bizarro!) to mess with the proceedings. Not every one of these stories hit the jackpot with me, but the ones that did were right on the money. And, yes, I did wait until today, December 10th to read the title story. Sometimes I'm so cute I make myself sick. Me: Okay but I don't...like...short stories. Like at all. Book: Dude that is totally fine but just read like the first one.

Honestly though, I didn't care for this selection of short stories. 'Victory Lap' was okay...decent enough to re-read, even. But it just went downhill from there. Towards the end of the book I found that I was forcing myself to finish the book just for the sake of finishing the book. I had grown tired of his, well, everything. His writing style doesn't change from story to story. And it gets very old, very fast. It reminded me of stories that I wrote/heard back in college level creative writing classes. The stories had no trajectory. The characters are one dimensional. The narration is curt & trite in this annoying MTV-cut style. The prose is pedestrian & lacking. I could go on and on and on, but even criticizing it is boring me almost as much as the stories themselves did. I'm willing to give another one of his books a shot, because I feel as though I'm missing something, given how head over heels everyone else seems to be for his writing...but I suspect I'll be just as disappointed the next time as well. Here's hoping not though. ...more Catie told me that some stories reminded her of Black Mirror, and they do. What she didn't mention is that Saunders is quite funny. Hapless, kind-hearted underachievers seem to be his specialty. A rare short story collection that held my attention all the way through. I was lucky to score a review copy of the audio of these stories from Random House (you can listen to a 4 minute excerpt on their website). The stories are read by the author, which I really love hearing in his voice. He has a somewhat dry tone that lends well the simultaneous whimsy and morbidity that are found in his stories. I have read several volumes of Saunders' short stories, and this combination of light with dark is his style, but he is able to make it fresh with each new story.

I have read several volumes of Saunders' short stories, and this combination of light with dark is his style, but he is able to make it fresh with each new story. The Semplica-Girl Diaries , linked here on the New Yorker website, is probably the most awkward in audio form. The entire story is told in journal entry form, skipping out on verbs, easier to read in print than to hear, where it feels choppy. On the other hand, one of my favorite stories was \"Victory Lap,\" because the way the author reads the female teenager is entertaining. She is always interjecting phrases like \"pas de chat, pas de chat, changement, changement,\" in between observations of the neighborhood and thoughts on her life. It becomes easy to see her in your mind, prancing around and doing silly kicks. It made me laugh multiple times, no matter the ending. My other favorite story is \"Escape from Spiderhead,\" about inmates forced into medical testing, scary. These are absolutely worth the listen, or the read if you get it in print. In my opinion, Saunders is one of the greatest craftsmen of the short story. ...more In late 2004 I was reading an older issue of The Believer and came across Ryan Bartelmay's interview with Philip Seymour Hoffman. Prior to the interview they agreed to talk about some of their favorite books (PSH at that time was reading Capote's works in preparation for what would be his Oscar winning portrayal of the author); Bartelmay had The Believer send Hoffman a copy of Saunders' Pastoralia as a possible discussion topic.

Prior to the interview they agreed to talk about some of their favorite books (PSH at that time was reading Capote's works in preparation for what would be his Oscar winning portrayal of the author); Bartelmay had The Believer send Hoffman a copy of Saunders' Pastoralia as a possible discussion topic. During the interview, the two of them start discussing, and laughing about, one of the book's stories (\"Sea Oak\") - and the interview digressed to such a level that the editor of the magazine interjected a break in the discussion to give an overview of the story to the reader. I had never seen this done before; if the story was that good, to both derail the interview AND to cause the editor to give a synopsis, why wasn't I reading it? Continuing the disruptive moment, I set the magazine down and went to my local bookshop, picked up Pastoralia and proceeded to read not just \"Sea Oak\", but every other blessed story in the collection before returning to The Believer. I was smitten. When I have recommended Saunders to friends (I have given his story collections out as birthday or Christmas gifts at least a half-dozen times), and he doesn't resonate with them, I get it. There is an almost zaniness to his prose that makes you feel like you are traveling downhill at an increasing rate of speed in a conveyance with suspect brakes. His subject matter can be strange (and to some, off-putting) and fantastical, but there is so much depth to his narratives that carry through the sometimes jarring nature of the tale. Which is why I love his stories. This collection of Saunders' most recent work has some wonderful stories. You can laugh at \"My Chivalric Fiasco\", cry at \"Home\" or \"Escape from Spiderhead\", or just sit and admire the beauty of the title story, \"Tenth of December\". I wouldn't recommend this as the first Saunders book (I'd stick with Pastoralia for a reader's first Saunders experience), but once you've gotten a feel for his fiction, I hope said reader experiences some of the same things that made me feel that this book is a gem, and Mr. Saunders is a short fiction genius. ...more Urgent, humane and deeply felt short stories by an absolute master of the form.

And while many of the situations are despairing \u2013 a returning war vet is a ticking time bomb with his extended family (\u201cHome\u201d), a father tries to keep up with the Joneses for his children but gets in way over his head (the masterful \u201cThe Semplica Girl Diaries\u201d) \u2013 Saunders finds humour in his characters\u2019 honest reactions. I can see myself reading almost each one of these 10 stories again and again, over the years. ...more Oh dear. I had no idea who author George Saunders was when I borrowed the audio book from OverDrive, where he also narrates. His name alone conjured up images for me of a very gentrified older Englishman with a lot of class. What his voice sounded like was a 20-ish slovenly Midwesterner with a slur. Turns out he was raised on the South side of Chicago, so neither he nor his stories were what I expected at all. I think the voice was maybe a bit put on for comedic purposes; immature, not like a gr Oh dear.

Turns out he was raised on the South side of Chicago, so neither he nor his stories were what I expected at all. I think the voice was maybe a bit put on for comedic purposes; immature, not like a grown up in his 50's. I found much of the humor in the stories not funny. They were rather bleak short stories (yuk), some dystopia here, fantasy there (double yuk), and also hard (for me) to follow. I know I'm in the minority with my rating, but I like short stories to have some cohesiveness, even a tad bit of continuity in theme or style. This was all over the place and just felt sloppy. Even repeating some of them, I was not sure of what was happening. In \"The Semplica-Girl Diaries,\" the writing in the diary was at times in Tarzan-speak. Short, incomplete sentences. In \"My Chivalric Fiasco\" he wrote in present day but his narration somehow evolved into Olde English. Anon, methinks whenst thee speaketh thus, thou hast becometh desperate. All this served only to distract me from what the characters were up to. Everyone's reviews lists their most and least favorite stories. I found that I only sort of liked one story, the very last one, the title story. I felt it was too long in coming. ...more First Gent --Did you hear the New York Times has a TOTAL CRUSH on Tenth of December ? Second Gent --WHAAAAAT the Times never gets crushes on anyone!

Second Gent --[faintly] Fan me. -------------------------------------- Oh my goodness. George Saunders is one of those writers who are so damn good it's awkward trying to praise them. You need a Saunders to do justice to a Saunders. But I will try. 1. Saunders' style is unique and delightful. 1a. It is also highly imitable. 1b. [1a] doesn't matter. 1c. None of the Saundalikes (see what I did there) that I've read have managed to capture anything more than the superficial cadences of Saunders' writing. 2. Reading Saunders' work will actually make your heart grow. 2a. I defy anyone to read the title story in this collection without tearing up. 3. He understands human behavior, and he loves our sad sorry species anyway, and he writes about us so beautifully that his work could if necessary stand as some justification for our existence. 4. If you think [3] sounds fangirly, check out the New York Times review. ...more This collection is like reading the tandem effort of Chekhov's compassion and Twain's funnybone in trying to wrap around the lives of Raymond Carver's characters. Laughed out loud several times per story; always something to be grateful for. The compassion and the humor, though, tend to feel somewhat programmatic, as if he were trying too hard, possibly a consequence of the repetition of themes or tropes in the collection. Very good book though, despite the crazy hype. Having just finished these stories & vowing not to be 1 of those reviewers who writes like the writer, wanted to write a few things anyway. Like 1, that he has characters that do the wildest stuff. Haha. Who is George Saunders? Just an academic type or really good. That\u2019s for you to decide. Fell asleep reading many times. That\u2019s how good. Once woke up thinking that two Dwarves were performing coitus outside my window (!) but just cicadas. Always cicadas. Reminds me. Need to get screen-in por Having just finished these stories & vowing not to be 1 of those reviewers who writes like the writer, wanted to write a few things anyway.

Need to get screen-in porch cleared for get-together on weekend. Roommate says we shouldn\u2019t spend so much time but everyone is special rainbow, needs best attention & no porch with cicadas. Cicadas loud, gross etc. Furthermore, no more drinks from the 7/11 because they lose liquor license when too many kids buy drinks without ID. Being of age, I have ID. I show ID & hand over the goods. Reminds me. Sometimes when writer writes he starts sentence just too\u2014 But then they ask, where\u2019s ID? You don\u2019t look aged. Stephen M: But I am! What do you think? Dubious Clerk Lady: Certainly? I still need ID. Last people who don\u2019t check get shut down by government. Stephen M: Okay one moment. I will remove my wallet post-haste. Incredulous Clerk: I don\u2019t have all night. Look at these paying customers! There were paying customers, impatient. Stephen M: Okay, my sincerest apologies, here it is. Skeptical Female: All right. I suppose you\u2019re aged. & I almost left when I saw Porcelain jungle cats on sale. Ask for approximate monetary value. Lady says, approx. = $111 So I told her ha! no way Jose. Better news: scratch cards behind desk. & Before paying customers come after, I buy many scratch cards. None win. Big place on left when driving home. Looks like a Silo & is out of place. Very odd. I decide to take out my Prolicks\u2122 and ice my teeth. Shhhh. Don\u2019t tell people I was icing & driving. Very bad. Muy mal. Only when really sad, down in dumps. The light from the sky was most definitely the Ethernets, an extra-terrestrial life form that comes disguised as Pygmy Elephants. Also 2, that he has a very unique story-telling method. He eschews three-act structure which is fresh but sometimes he cuts it too early & feeling = hanging dry, uncertain, scared of the unknown. That will be irksome for readers who need narrative closure. So many Pygmy Elephants in my car, I can barely turn the steering wheel & I can\u2019t stop the car from swaying right & sailing through the guardrail! Reminds me. There was an episode of Three\u2019s Company in which Jack and Larry feel great embarrassment over Jack being gay but not really being gay. Ha ha! Such a good episode. Funny characters and whacky plot. Wonder if writer knows about this American television show and its enduring impression on the populace. At home finally & very wet (!) so are Pygmy Elephants but they\u2019re extra-terrestrials & used to surviving in extreme climates. I reach for my SatchelPack\u2122 & up the Prolicks\u2122 dosage. My head is swimming. The Pygmy Elephanys attempt to catch my fall but no avail. Hell hath no fury, etc. etc. Remember episode when Darlene, Chrissy\u2019s high-school friend visits & Jack invites her for mother\u2019s b-day but Darlene is a call girl! Haha! Ha! So funny. Finally 3, I met writer & writer very nice, very generous. He encourage me to write write write. Refreshing in a world so jaded, cynical about world. I think writing-career like sinking ship, but I\u2019m no professional. Not like writer. He\u2019s the real deal. No doubting. ...more<---C>George Saunders</---C>", "Title": "Tenth of December"},
