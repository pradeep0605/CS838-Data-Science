Obtain a copy of <+++>Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe</+++> . 2. Read the book. 3. Fall in love. Fall in love with the writing, the characters, everything. Read past midnight, read in school, read everywhere and all the time. Slam the book shut and whisper-scream oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh. At the end of the book, allow a single tear to run down your right cheek and say a silent prayer of thanks for the fact that you are able to read at all. Perhaps I\u2019m making this book seem more dramatic than it actually is. It\u2019s not dramatic at all, in the typical sense. There are no overtly sentimental Nicholas Sparks plot twists, no super sexy erotica Fifty Shades of Grey style, not even an ardent declaration of love via Jane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice. This book is about two Mexican-American teens trying to find their way in the world, but before they do that, they find each other \u2013 Aristotle and Dante, the former a self-doubting silent guy, the latter an expressive, fair skinned swimmer. We experience the story from Ari\u2019s perspective, from the first time he met Dante at his local swimming pool. I\u2019d never really been very close to other people. I was pretty much a loner. I\u2019d played basketball and baseball and done the Cub Scout thing, tried the Boy Scout thing \u2013 but I always kept my distance from the other boys. I never felt like I was a part of their world. Throughout the book, Aristotle and Dante are exposed and layered, continually growing more complex but also becoming more bare. Their coming of age story is shown beautifully. What seems like a simple story about friendship is a simple story about friendship, but there are profound themes woven in and the quality of the characterization is simply breathtaking. Dante, a lover of poetry and a passionate crier, reminded me of myself so much it hurt, while every ounce of Aristotle\u2019s emotions \u2013 his confusion, his longing, his hate \u2013 resonated with me. I sometimes think that I don\u2019t let myself know what I\u2019m really thinking about. That doesn\u2019t make much sense but it makes sense to me. I have this idea that the reason we have dreams is that we\u2019re thinking about things we don\u2019t know we\u2019re thinking about \u2013 and those things, well, they sneak out of us in our dreams. Maybe we\u2019re like tires with too much air in them. The air has to leak out. That\u2019s what dreams are. Benjamin Alire Saenz has poetic prose. There aren\u2019t many compound sentences or large SAT words in this book, but every word impacted me. Sometimes the shortest sentence flooded me with feeling. Every description of Dante\u2019s laugh, every time the boys would call each other weird, every moment they spent together \u2013 it felt like I was there, experiencing their friendship and their bond. Have you ever heard that saying, if there\u2019s a book you want to read but it\u2019s not published, write it yourself? I won\u2019t stop writing, but Saenz has accomplished that for me here. Saenz dedicates this book \u201cto all the boys who\u2019ve had to learn to play by different rules.\u201d As a homosexual Asian-American living in Virginia, I\u2019ve had to learn to play by the rules of my parents, my society, and most importantly, myself. Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe will speak to Mexican-Americans, homosexuals, tom-girls, book nerds, loners, etc. Essentially, it will appeal to everyone who\u2019s ever felt different, who\u2019s ever felt like they weren\u2019t sure of who they were. Highly recommended for all. ...more This book was so so beautiful. In actuality, it doesn't have a \"plot\". Not a main story or event that the characters center around. It's about a boy.

I liked that it was slow paced, that it felt like real life with small but important events happening. I actually really liked Aristotle, the main character, even though he's kind of a jerk. But the thing is he doesn't want to be a jerk. I loved the relationships, especially with his best friend, Dante. It was real friendship, not false or easy. I loved the emphasis on family. And the ending was beautiful. So beautiful. I really related to the main character, his struggles of culture and feeling lonely and regretting growing up. And when I didn't relate to him I still empathized. I just wanted to hug Aristotle. I didn't realize how much I loved this book until it ended. I flew through it so quickly that I didn't realize how beautiful it was, how happy it made me feel. This is absolutely a new favourite. I can't wait to reread it. ...more I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING Oh gosh, my feelings are all over the place. It started in a very captivating way. I liked the narrator.

Everything about him made me think of an angel, a sweet sweet angel. I wish the world was filled with more people like Dante because this world would have been a much lovelier place. This is really a coming of age YA novel. Even though it\u2019s shelved as LGBT (<---B>which IS true and shelved it myself as it too</---B>), there is a good part of this story where it doesn\u2019t feel that way. It\u2019s mostly about friendship, family, trust, loyalty and being honest to ourselves and who we truly are. Then, comes the LGBT part and romance as well. I have to say that I throughout the story craved to see some romantic affection between Ari and Dante. There aren\u2019t many scenes at all that show some, because Ari isn\u2019t gay\u2026 Or is he? I kept wondering while reading and felt like I knew, right inside me, the answer, except that I never could have been one hundred percent sure. Gladly, we do get an answer. Actually, every answer I could have had regarding events, characters and scenes were answered and that is a big plus to the book. The writing, at first, didn\u2019t quite work for me to be honest. It\u2019s a very simple style. The kind I could write myself without any problem. EXCEPT, we could actually feel as if it were really Ari\u2019s writing and that is an exceptional thing and very a witty way of writing a story when I think of it. I do admit that sometimes I really wished we had Dante\u2019s POV, just to know how he thinks and what\u2019s in his mind. Wait, I do know what-or who should I say-he\u2019s always thinking of. I just think at least one scene would have been so spectacular to have narrated by him. It\u2019s weird because Ari has sisters (and a brother) but we never actually really got to meet them or get to know those sisters. I don\u2019t even remember his sisters\u2019 names, if the narrator even told us their names in the first place. Shame because I really wanted to get to know them. I\u2019m so glad this story includes an animal, being the animal lover that I am. I feel like they usually bring a nice atmosphere inside a story and this one-a dog-sure did. Also, you need to know that this is a sad story. I mean, sure, there are many cute and happy moments, but drama usually follows. Plus, with that kind of atmosphere, how could I have held back my tears? Do I recommend this book? Like air... ...more \u201cThe summer sun was not meant for boys like me.

I wanted to read this so badly, which is why I finally, finally got my hands on a copy and started reading rightaway. I also finished reading it rightaway. My thoughts: Well first of all, I love the way I can identify with Ari and Dante, but especially with Ari. Sometimes his stubbornness got on my nerves and I wanted to shake him and tell him that he should just go and love Dante. But on the other hand everything just felt so real. Which leads me to my second point about how I kept on reading and nodding my head, smiling about how true some statements and feelings pictured in the novel felt. The thing is, S\u00e1enz does not try to be philosophical and poetic. He doesn't have to. Third, you can see how Ari grows. In the beginning he is a 15 year old boy, he talks like a 15 year old boy, he thinks like one. But as he grows older he learns and experiences things, especially through Dante, he changes. I just want to state that this novel is a perfect example of character development. What bothered me (just a little), is the ending. Yes, it's happy and lovely and that's what I wished for but I had the feeling that everything went too fast. Particularly the revelations about the past. And also I am kind of angry. Why, whywhywhy couldn't we read more about their happy ever after? I mean, I've been waiting for this the whole time and now I don't even get two whole pages of Ari&Dante as a couple! Not fair. I want - need - a sequel! Reread: I'm still very much in love with this book. There may have been something in my eyes, they got a little teary. Update: We're getting a sequel.

A Printz Honor book featuring a gay romance between two quirky characters - one of whom is a rough guy who gets into fights and has a complicated relationship with his father; the other being a sweet and sensitive boy who loves his poetry. Throw in some philosophical musings and a generous helping of poetic teen angst and you should be serving up a new favourite of mine, right? Apparently not. I love deep, complex and emotional contemporary YA that reminds me why I still read books aimed at teens. But, you know, I just didn't find this book as deep and meaningful as it was obviously trying to be. There were some intriguing passages thrown in that were clearly meant to tickle our inner emos, like: \u201cThe problem with my life was that it was someone else\u2019s idea.\u201d And: \u201cI wondered what it was we were laughing about. Was it just our names? Were we laughing because we were relieved? Were we happy? Laughter was another one of life\u2019s mysteries.\u201d But it all felt like a good old example of trying too hard. The characters of Aristotle and Dante are two very different individuals who form an instant connection and go on to become close friends, but they never seemed like anything but caricatures of angsty teens with the pretentious poetry reading and frequent philosophical phrases that made me cringe. The dialogue was particularly unrealistic. There are some writers who can pull off floaty poetic speech between their characters, and then there are those who fail to sound more than fake, overdone and scripted. In my opinion, this book was in the latter category. However, I feel this way about John Green and everyone seems to love him too, so it's hardly surprising that I once again find myself in the minority. Not only does the constant waxing poetic feel a bit off, but the rest of the time we're treated to a choppy, fragmented narrative that gave me flashbacks to The Perks of Being a Wallflower . For example: \u201cWhen I got home, I sat on my front porch. I watched the sun set. I felt alone, but not in a bad way. I really liked being alone. Maybe I liked it too much. Maybe my father was like that too. I thought of Dante and wondered about him.\u201d I think I get what this book was trying to do and I also get what many people probably thought it was doing... but I can point you towards authors who do a similar kind of thing and make it seem less cheesy and far more real and meaningful: A.S.King, Melina Marchetta, Matthew Quick and Sara Zarr, to name but a few. When compared to the works of those authors, these characters and this writing just pale in comparison. In my opinion, anyway.

I\u2019d never really been very close to other people. I was pretty much a loner. I\u2019d played basketball and baseball and done the Cub Scout thing, tried the Boy Scout thing \u2013 but I always kept my distance from the other boys. I never felt like I was a part of their world. his is not a case of being a bookish, indoor kid who doesn't relate to the rough and tumble world of \"normal\" boys; he likes to fight and drink and he wants a truck and a dog - he has just never felt comfortable in the company of boys. until he meets dante. dante is definitely one of the indoor boys. he is sensitive, he reads poetry and draws, he is emotional and frequently cries, and asks probing and highly personal questions with his deeply inquisitive mind. he is also mexican-american, but has only a tenuous relationship to his cultural heritage, and this discomfort affects him deeply, even though he is very self-assured in other aspects of his character. for some reason, the two boys find something in each other that just clicks, and they become inseparable over the course of a summer. the novel traces their relationship and their various insecurities and their growing attachment to each other from ari's perspective, as he struggles with his identity and his inability to recognize what it is that he wants out of life. and that is gripe number one. (view spoiler) [ari never comes out, in the traditional sense. no, he is sat down by his mother and father who basically inform him that he is gay and in love with dante. which, for someone so closed-off emotionally, makes a little bit of sense, but is very clumsy narratively-speaking. it takes away the opportunity for character-growth, basically, and the revelation lacks any impact it could have had if ari had come to that conclusion himself. it's a little uncomfortable, actually; what teenager likes being told what to do by their parents, let alone being told to whom or to what gender they are attracted?? and since this takes place in 1987 with a mexican-american family, it seems way more progressive than should be expected. while i very much appreciate the novelty of ari as a gay protagonist , the \"not every gay male is emotional or theatrical or even, frankly, likable ,\" i think it would have been a stronger scene if he had discovered this about himself, instead of just being coaxed into it. (hide spoiler) ] my second gripe is the writing style, particularly the dialogue. there are people who have a knack for dialogue and people who do not, and people who have a facility for writing stilted stylized dialog that doesn't \"ring true\" but is still effective, like david mamet. but here, the dialogue didn't feel natural and these characters never came alive for me. there was a lot of repetition in their speech, and a lot of those snappy, witty moments you find in YA contemporary fiction, but it never felt relaxed. to use this portion of a david foster wallace interview i just read: That's why people use terms like flow or effortless to describe writing that they regard as really superb. They're not saying effortless in terms of it didn't seem like the writer spent any work. It simply requires no effort to read it - the same way listening to an incredible storyteller talk out loud requires no effort to pay attention. Whereas when you're bored, you're conscious of how much effort is required to pay attention. and i wasn't bored - i am not saying that, but i think the same rule applies to things that are so overly manipulated that they don't feel the way people really speak or interact. i mean, it's a novel - we all know it is a construct, but sometimes even a construct can feel\u2026 effortless. for example, i just don't buy this kind of emo-poetic musing coming from a kid who pushes down all his emotions and is battling all his violent urges: Even though summers were mostly made of sun and heat, summers for me were about the storms that came and went. And left me feeling alone. Did all boys feel alone? The summer sun was not meant for boys like me. Boys like me belonged to the rain. but enough of my griping - there are some really touching moments in here, although for me, the most resonant ones came from ari's relationship with his parents rather than his relationship with dante. good stuff, just not the lingering heartbreaking tenderness i was anticipating. ...more Update Feb 2017 Lowering my rating to 3 stars since I think 4.5 was super duper generous 4.5* I just didn't really love it as much as I had thought I would.

Making some edits that are signified by \"**\" as of 9/7/2016 because it seems I did not clarify my feelings enough. Alright before I explain my thoughts, I want to leave a few notes: 1. Before people assume I didn't \"understand\" the point of the novel, let me be clear that I DO. I see the underlying motives behind the author in most of what he's done, and while a few moments may have been lost in my attention to the audiobook (listening to a book and capturing EVERYTHING is generally much harder than reading it, so I will always admit some things may get lost when reflecting on an audiobook) I would like to think I do really understand it. Despite understanding, I just don't AGREE with most of this book, which is totally fine because I can see the author's intentions and that's just my opinion on it. 2. The main reason I'm posting this review is A. I'm frustrated and just have to let out a little bit. B. I KNOW that this book is loved by many (95% of Goodreads reviewers liked it) and I can already hear that gasps of a \"1 star review\", so I figure it's worth explaining. That being said, in posting this review, I'm sincerely not looking for forward discussion on it. I don't feel it's worth defending my stance on it to the amount of comments I'm going to receive disagreeing with me, so don't expect much more than this post on my thoughts. L I K E S: - Dante- Dante is a precious little angel. He was by far the only reason I continued reading this book. I really enjoyed his character, every moment with him brightened up the book a little more for me, and I WIIIIISH the entire book was from his perspective. He is a ball of sunshine and deserves sooooo much better than Ari. -Latinx Representation- A mostly POC cast is not something YA gets all that often, so I really enjoyed getting a story about a group of Mexican families. The learning about culture was really enjoyable and naturally written. I especially really enjoyed reading about Dante's struggle with his ethnicity, as that's not something I've ever really read about before. -Family Dynamic- Again in YA, a strong family dynamic is not something we see a lot, considering most parents are either single, absent, or dead. Exploring these two families was an interesting reading experience, and something I'd like to see more of. D I S L I K E S: -Plot- There was virtually NO PLOT in this book. As the book progressed, we did get a better idea of what the point was, but for the most part, especially in the beginning, there was no real connection between the course of events we were exposed to. I am a plot-based reader, it's my favorite part of reading a novel, so naturally, it just was not the book for me. -Pacing- The pacing also improved slightly as the book went on, but the beginning was BRUTAL. It felt like the story had been written completely, but the author cut out a LARGE amount of scenes that were in between the chapters that were actually published. It felt like I was reading snapshots of a story, not a full novel. Due to this, it also felt like the story did not occur over the actual period of time it did? If I am correct, it takes place over a full year, a.k.a. two summers, but it felt SIGNIFICANTLY shorter than that because I don't think we fully got to see everything that happened over that year. -Ari- Ari is absolutely one of the most infuriating characters I've ever read from. He's extremely annoying, impulsive, and does not think before he speaks or acts. His train of thought felt very distant from who he appeared to be when interacting with others (I understand he never revealed much on the exterior, and he learned that from his father [See, I really DID understand the book] but his dialogue and interactions with others seemed almost unnaturally less eloquent and intellectual than his internal monologue.) It just didn't even feel like the same character sometimes. Also despite moments of strength in the book, (view spoiler) [ like jumping in front of a car to save Dante's life, and if I said it didn't make me emotional and like him a little more, I would be lying (hide spoiler) ] I really despised how he treated Dante a lot of the time. (view spoiler) [ When Dante admits that Ari is one of the two things he loves most in the world, Ari virtually says \"You shouldn't say things like that\". He is so unbelievably dismissive of Dante's feelings and his sexuality, and I refuse to condone behavior like that. **I FULLY understand that this is an expression of internalized homophobia, which is extremely common for people coming to terms with their sexuality. I GET THAT. But regardless, homophobic comments no matter what the underlying motives/unconscious thoughts are, it's not something I like reading about and really gets under my skin.** Dante writes him these long letters when he is in Chicago basically sharing every aspect of his life with Ari, and Ari admits to either not replying or sending short replies. This infuriated me to no end. My BIGGEST issue is when Dante admits while he was kissing the other boy, he was thinking of kissing Ari and Ari says \"You need to get a new head.\" As ideas like \"gay is a way of thinking\" \"you can just turn it off\" essentially \"you chose to be gay\" are completely FALSE, I was appalled to see a comment of similar nature in this book. **Again, I KNOW this is internalized homophobia, but it still is not something I like to see/read.** This line sincerely disgusted me and I was so close to giving up on the book right then and there. Literally, every moment that involved Dante's sexuality, other than when he is hospitalized & *how very conveniently*, the last scene, Ari basically ignores Dante's sexuality. I understand this book takes place in an earlier era where homosexuality is not as widely accepted as it is today. I KNOW that. But it does not change the fact that Ari's dismissiveness of Dante made the book entirely unpleasant to read. (hide spoiler) ] He is sincerely one of my least favorite characters of all time and a large reason of why I hated this book. -Perspectives- I think the biggest mistake this book made was exclusively being told through Ari's perspective. Also, if you know my reading tastes at all, you would know I almost ALWAYS prefer first-person narratives from only one perspective, so this is a pretty big deal that I would prefer a duel perspective in this case. I'm not trying to undermine his story in any way, though I lost interest in quite a few aspects of it. I just cannot fathom why we did not get Dante's perspective. **LET ME BE CLEAR, this upcoming comment is NOT an attempt at \"speaking for the LGBT community\". It's something I've observed others discussing, but not in relation to this book, which is why I wanted to bring it up and hopefully get clarification as to why no one talks about this issue in regards to this book.** In my experience of reading YA LGBT+ books, I've noticed A LOT of people get passionate when significant moments in a gay character's life are told from a different character's perspective, which is something I totally agree with. Yet the entire book is told from Ari's perspective and we learn about significant moments in Dante's life (view spoiler) [ ex. him kissing boys for the first time, every time he admits his feelings for Ari, getting physically assaulted for being gay (hide spoiler) ] all from Ari's viewpoint. I just sincerely don't understand why this is an issue I see countless people speaking out on this problem in a million other books with LGBT+ characters, yet everyone seems to skip over the same exact issue in this one. **After someone of the LGBT community was kind enough to offer some enlightenment on this thought, (view spoiler) [ I do now understand that because Ari is actually gay, it's totally okay for him to be telling Dante's story from his perspective. I'm extremely glad I now know this. That being said, I do still think this book would have benefited from incorporating Dante's perspective. Maybe I personally just would have enjoyed it more, and that's cool if I'm alone in that. (hide spoiler) ] This book truly NEEDED both perspectives and I think it only could have improved my overall enjoyment of the story. Honestly, this book was terrible in my opinion. The few things I did like didn't come close to outweighing what I hated. It is the first book I have ever come close to DNFing in nearly 3 years of avidly reading. ** Here I originally said, \"I would never recommend this book to anyone.\" Though it is definitely one of my least favorite books ever, I think I would still recommend it to someone who was looking for an LGBT read with Latinx/Hispanic characters because I know I am in the very small 1% who did not enjoy it. It's very obvious that this book has changed people's lives, which I think is amazing even if I didn't like the book. So I retract that original statement and say I WOULD recommend it to someone who was interested in reading it, but if we have similar tastes and what I've discussed above seems like something you would agree with, we may (on a very very small chance) end up feeling the same.** I sincerely feel like I read an entirely different book than everyone else who raves about it. Maybe it's because my personal reading tastes weren't fulfilled, maybe things got lost in translation of the audiobook, I don't know. What I do know is I want to erase reading this book from my memory and not ever think about it again. **I seem to get a lot of hate for this comment. I do understand it's harsh, but let my clarify that the reason I wish I could forget reading it is because I had very good expectations for this novel and I would rather still have those same feelings than be disappointed by this extremely popular book. I didn't pay a cent for this book, but I'm still returning it to Audible out of principle and because I don't even want to see it in my library. ...more \"As Dante was watching me search the sky through the lens of a telescope, he whispered, 'Someday, I'm going to discover all of the secrets of the universe.'\" All of the stars in the universe - an instant favourite. As some of you may know, I'm a sucker for a good coming-of-age love story, and this one completely delivered. I read this in one sitting. One. I don't think you understand, I'm ADHD, I hardly ever finish a book in one sitting. But this book? I refused to put it down.

I don't think you understand, I'm ADHD, I hardly ever finish a book in one sitting. But this book? I refused to put it down. I said I'd read the first chapter before I went to bed, and before I knew it, it was 2 am, and I was a complete mess, crying, and hugging this book to my chest because it was so damn good. I swear, if it wasn't 2 am, I would have turned back to page one, and started all over again. (Drinking game: Take a shot every time I say \"universe\" in this review. Or don't, you may get alcohol poisoning by the second half.) I've always had an all-consuming fascination with the universe and how utterly complex and thrilling all of it is. I once read my astronomy textbook from cover-to-cover for fun. Yeah, I'm that kid. I completely understood what Dante and Ari where always talking about - how they wanted to discover the secrets of the universe. I've been looking for the same things. \"I bet you could find all of the mysteries of the universe in someone's hand.\" I loved all of these characters, and loved how raw and real everything was. Ari was a fantastic narrator, and Dante was added to my list of fictional characters too pure and good for this world. The ever-present family and heritage aspect in this book were also wonderful. Though I am not Spanish myself, all of my babysitters growing up were from Spanish-speaking countries, so I've had a love for the Hispanic culture ever since I was little. \"The summer sun was not meant for boys like me. Boys like me belonged to the rain.\" Funnily enough, in my review of Eleanor & Park , I mentioned how I disliked that the book took place in the eighties. Aristotle and Dante took place (correct me if I got the dates wrong, please) in the summers of 1985 - 1987, yet it seemed to flow much nicer, and much more naturally in this book. Everything just fit in it's place perfectly. \"We all fight our own private wars.\" The last scene left me with tears in my eyes. Happy tears, but tears all the same. I've been emotionally impacted by a book many times over, but this one was practically life-changing. (view spoiler) [ \"All this time. That's what was wrong with me. All this time I had been trying to figure out the secrets of the universe, the secrets of my own body, of my heart. All of the answers had always been so close and yet I had fought them without even knowing it. From the minute I'd met Dante, I had fallen in love with him. (...) I took Dante's hand and held it. How could I have ever been ashamed of loving Dante Quintana?\" That was such a perfect last paragraph, and such a perfect last line, I just (hide spoiler) ] Suffice to say, I absolutely adored this book. I could go on for hours about Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, but instead of that, I'll end the review with my favourite quote from it: \"'There are worse things in the world than a boy who like to kiss other boys.'\" [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more BEAUTIFUL.

It's so precious and I deeply connect with it in a way that I don't often do when reading a book. This book truly is a blessing and I beg you all to read it. It's so important and well written and real and stunning and precious and true and perfect I just can't even express it!!!! I am emotional. URGH it's 1.06am and I cannot contain my tears. My pillow is wet. This is such an emotional ride, my heart and my soul feels heavy. I don't think u can understand how relatable in the most serious, heart breaking way this book is unless you've experienced or are experiencing living in the closet. This literally breaks my heart but it's beautiful and I love it. Rtc. Ahh this was everything I hoped it would be and more.

I am still in a blubbering mess of feelings. I can't, for the life of me, write something that justify the perfection of this book. I wish I could even write poetry or paint the sky to tell you all how I feel about this book. Because Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe just makes me cry and smile and happy and believe in the power written words and the rain and of friendship and love between. The writing is lyrical but never florid. It's simple but never simplistic. Even if it is written solely from Ari's point of view, but you will get to know the others too. The brave Dante. The loving two sets of parents. The dog named Legs. With Ari, you will feel like you are on a journey to discover the secrets of the universe, that sometimes the answers are right beside you all along (ps: the ending, is happy, okay?)

I can only describe the writing as brisk. Chapters are short and to the point. Some in fact are only a few sentence long. There are times I became convinced it really was written by a moody teenager. It's like reading Air's journal. Ari and Dante quickly became real people to me and I easily fell in love with them both. The story made me laugh and cry more times then I could count. There is no complex plot with many moving parts. It's just a simple story about two boys and how they discover themselves, the world and the part they play in it. Masterfully written! I can see why it's won so many awards. ...more Cross-posted at Shelf Inflicted and at Outlaw Reviews I really loved Last Night I Sang to the Monster . It was sad, beautiful and powerful.

If a story has the kind of power to turn me inside out, then I want more. So you can imagine how thrilled I was to finally get a copy of Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe from the library. The cover is gorgeous and infused with meaning. The story was easy to read and difficult to put down. This was an introspective story about two very different Mexican-American boys as they navigate the troubled waters of adolescence. This is the kind of story I should have loved, particularly for the fact there are so few Latino characters in young-adult fiction. The story was told from the perspective of 15-year-old Angel Aristotle Mendoza (hereinafter known as Ari). Ari\u2019s older brother is in prison, his father is emotionally distant, his mother is warm and loving, but keeps lots of secrets. So I can understand why Ari has a hard time expressing his feelings. He\u2019s introverted, angry, lonely, and confused. One of the major problems with Ari telling this story is that he is incapable of expressing any deep feelings. Enter Dante Quintana, who offers to teach Ari to swim while the boys are at the neighborhood pool. Dante loves art, loves to read and has a good relationship with his parents. Though he\u2019s warm and friendly, he\u2019s a little too different to have many friends. Dante and Ari bond. There is lots of questioning about identity and sexuality. There is an accident, a long-distance move, a sharing of secrets, and lots of pondering of big questions in a small way. There was also lots of laughter. \u201cDo you have sex?\u201d \u201cSex?\u201d \u201cSex, Ari.\u201d \u201cNo, never had sex, Dante. But I\u2019d like to.\u201d \u201cMe too. See what I mean? We\u2019re nice.\u201d \u201cNice,\u201d I said. \u201cShit.\u201d \u201cShit,\u201d he said. And then we busted out laughing. (Smoking pot for the first time) We both smiled, then laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re a bad boy,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re a bad boy too.\u201d \u201cJust what we\u2019ve always wanted to be.\u201d \u201cIf our parents knew,\u201d I said. \u201cIf our parents knew,\u201d he said. We laughed. There was just too much laughter and childish repetition, which got annoying very quickly. For a story that explored matters of the mind and heart, I felt there was not enough depth or emotion. Ari\u2019s parents, and Dante\u2019s for that matter, did not ring true to me. There was too much love and coddling and not enough conflict. The story took place in 1987 and I\u2019m thankful the boys wrote letters to each other, sparing me from reading text messages full of confusing shorthand. The ending felt too rushed and out of character. I won\u2019t say anything more, but I wish Ari had discovered it for himself. Not a huge fan of this work, but I do love S\u00e1enz\u2019 spare and elegant prose, and will look forward to reading more of his stories. ...more Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/ \"The summer sun was not meant for boys like me.

I\u2019m real deep like that. I got a little sidetracked with dealing with buttholes real life, but when I finally got a chance to sit down and read this last night I didn\u2019t put it down until the last page. When I got to work this morning, people noticed something was different about me. Normally I resemble something kinda like this . . . Today? Notsamuch. I blamed it on my new perfume . . . but really it\u2019s because of this story. Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe is a book with a bunch of award stickers on its cover. Generally that means I\u2019ll hate it \u2013 but I still always give those books a try because I assume the award people know what they\u2019re talking about. (Spoiler alert: They don\u2019t. Just check out some of the \u201cwinners\u201d on GR Best Reads list.) Anywho, I went in with low expectations. What did I discover? Well, to begin with the first line of the blurb is stupid. The most \u201clyrical\u201d thing about this novel is the title. There is no purple to be found within the pages of Aristotle and Dante - the prose is simple, the conversation minimal, the emotion palpable, the ideas grand . . . . \u201cSomeday I\u2019m going to discover all the secrets of the universe.\u201d \u201cWhat are you going to do with all those secrets, Dante?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll know what to do with them. Maybe change the world.\u201d This was one of the best coming of age stories I\u2019ve ever read. The boys were actually BOYS who spoke like boys with smartass mouths like boys and occasionally broke the rules like boys and questioned their place in the world like boys. AND THE PARENTS WERE PRESENT!!!! You know how rare that is in YA? Not only were they present, but they were functional (well, nearly). Things weren\u2019t perfect and there was darkness that needed to be explained before there could be light, but there was love and really that\u2019s pretty much the only requirement in order to raise children. Oh, and the characters WEREN\u2019T WHITE. Another rarity! In 2015 we should really be over this being such a BFD, but sadly that isn\u2019t the case. The timeframe being set to the wayback machine of 1987 also helped make me believe this story was really written for an old lady like me to partake in instead of just being a party crasher to something really meant for youngsters only and confirmed that we all could really have the same theme song . . . When my husband got home from a meeting last night I was all . . . and he was like \u201cyou are DEFINITELY not crying, because when you cry you look like this\u201d . . . Turns out I was feeling a little bit of everything . . . . Since I\u2019m a person who rarely feels ANYTHING (except annoyance and anger), I\u2019m recommending this to anybody who hasn\u2019t read it yet. Every star. Although many of my friends have read Aristotle and Dante's story, credit is going to Matthew for sharing so much of himself with us on Goodreads and for simply being an awesome person who tells me when I really neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed a particular book.

It took me a while to get into this book. But that's the only fault in this beautiful book. I am in awe of Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire S\u00e1enz. I only finished this book yesterday and I am still amazed by it. The writing was thought-provoking. It was captivating. It was beautiful. Some of the lines in this book made me sit back and take a breath because how can a simple string of words make you feel something so strong? That's what this book does. It makes you feel. Aristotle and Dante are two very different characters. They basically are a contrast of each other and yet their friendship, their love is inspiring. It's the kind of friendship everyone deserves. They are two highly relatable characters. They have their faults, plenty of them but they see the best in each other. They teach each other to love themselves. For me, family is a huge thing in books. Both Ari and Dante have wonderful parents. Ari's dad is a veteran from the war. His brother is in prison. His twin sisters don't live with him. He has a family but at the same time he doesn't know his family. His mum is so kind. She cares for Ari so much. As does his dad. This book wasn't just about Ari and Dante. No. It was about family. It was about Ari, learning to understand his dad. It was Ari learning to understand himself. Dante's parents have so much love for him. They don't care if their only son is gay. They wouldn't care if he committed a murder. They will always love him. Although I predict how the ending would go, it was still written out so perfectly that I couldn't have predicted how perfect it was for a way to resolve the book. This book is easily one of my favourite reads this year. I don't think there's many books that will be able to top it. It deserves ALL the hype it has gotten. ...more<---C>Benjamin Alire S\u00e1enz</---C>", "Title": "Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe"},
