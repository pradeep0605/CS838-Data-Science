I would most definitely read it ...more I would love to know how people can rate this book before it is even released.

It\u2019s hard to decide if the first or last was my favorite. I love falling into new worlds and discovering characters that I would genuinely like to meet. But the improvement in Kendal\u2019s writing and the crazy pace/twists in Revelations may push it to the #1 spot.

Our book club has been extremely lucky to have formed a relationship with the author and I can\u2019t wait to review more of Kendal\u2019s work! (SPOILERS) ***** **** *** ** * I was fooled into thinking that Keira was going along with Ballantine. Kept thinking of ways that she would straddle the line and make sure she didn\u2019t lose those that she loved. So torn, loving the idea of repenting and spending eternity with those we love. But killing everyone so that no one lost anything goes against the natural balance. Knowing that there is an end gives us a push to savor the moment and make the most of the time we do have. It was such a relief when Kiera saved Eligos and we finally knew her plan. I\u2019m a sucker for a wedding in the epilogue and we got a pregnancy on top of that! ...more Revelations By Lindsay Anne Kendal 4.5 Stars Keira finds herself in an awkward position where she has to do something that goes against everything her and her friends have always believed in. Realising that she not only understands Ballantine\u2019s ideas but also agrees with what he is trying to do leaves her with no choice but to join with him. This causes upset and anger amongst her friends and Keira feels torn between them.

This causes upset and anger amongst her friends and Keira feels torn between them. Lindsay\u2019s writing has noticeably improved between book two (Torment) and this book and it made for a whole better read. The emotion, tension and inner feelings of the characters came across to the reader much better than it did in the previous dialogue driven instalments of this series, and the descriptions made the scenes easy to visualise. I understand that both books, one and two, have undergone extensive rewrites and am interested to see the difference in them now. This was an exciting conclusion to the series and had an ending that I didn\u2019t expect! Copy supplied for review ...more Do you believe magic exists? That there is a world parallel to ours with which the supernatural subsists? What if one day you discover you had a gift but you have no idea whether it\u2019s good or evil and that you do not have a choice but to accept the fact that is. I enjoyed reading the series as any UF reader would. It was an interesting perspective of Hell, Lucifer and <---C>Lilith</---C>, demons in general, witches, even Angels. But I must warn you, an open mind is always necessary when reading urban fantasy. You can always tell when a writer pours their heart and soul into a book. Great ending to an amazing and fresh storyline. There were twists and turns I never saw coming. Such a climatic ending, I was gripping the book so tight in parts that my hands began to ache. My girlfriend is reading this now and has just been in tears. Definitely an emotional roller-coaster ride with the greatest scenes I've read in a long time. I'm looking forward to your next project.

Don't keep us waiting to long Ms. Kendal. ...more Well.... I read this book in a day It was amazing , just as I expected. You truly are an inspiration Lindsay Anne Kendal I'm waiting now for ur next books..... Get a live on girl haha Revelations had twists and turns and had me on the edge of my seat I read so much my eyes were stinging but I couldn't put it down I had to finish it to find out what happens I love all the characters and found it a really pleasant read xx Half way through this book I was kind of mad the direction the book was taking, but it did turn around at the end. This will be a spoiler but I just have to put it out there....I don't think the author should have had a pregnant woman drinking....even moderately....celebrating a victory. I think it sends a wrong message and really make me consider downgrading this review one star, but I hate to do so over one sentence towards the end of the book. Well,Well,Well what can I say except Miss Kendal Congratulations on keeping everyone in suspense for as long as you did,having some people crying,plenty of people laughing but most of all well done for such a gripping and nail biting trilogy. I hope for more.", "Title": "Revelations"},
