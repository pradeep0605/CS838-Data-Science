The singer who blasted out a fantastic, million-pound selling single, but never sold anything else; the actor that was brilliant in that one film, but disappeared off the scene immediately after; the model that did that great campaign, but never modelled again. It's a pretty common thing, to be honest. Sometimes, you also get authors/books that were one hit wonders. In my opinion, The Selection series should have, by all means, been a one hit wonder and nothing more. Not a trilogy. Not a series. Not a multi-novella, five book hit. The Selection was good. Yes, I enjoyed the first book. When I found it, it sounded exactly like my cup of tea: cute, fluffy, light, with that little bit of an oomph to make it exciting. Sure, it was dystopia and at the time, that's all I was reading because, to be fair, that's all you could find in the stores. Ever since The Hunger Games took off, dystopia was in. So I wasn't bothered by the glaring plot holes, the vapid heroine, the flaccid love interest because it was good. Then I read The Elite and I liked it! I thought America was really maturing and becoming the character everyone wants to root for. Maxon was slowly growing on me because, hey! He was sweet. I could not wait to get hold of the last book and see America and Maxon get their HEA. And then came The One. This is going to sound terrible, but you can feel the utter disinterest in the storyline, the rush to get to the ending and give the readers what they wanted. I was so shocked by it, by the product itself, that I honestly had to check it was written by Cass herself. I was not impressed. At all. But it gave me what I wanted -- America and Maxon got their HEA, and all the other characters were paired off with great love interests and the end came wrapped up in a pretty little bow and glitter. So, in the grand scheme of things, I was okay with it. Then <+++>The Heir</+++> was announced, and I couldn't resist reading it. What if this book gave me what The One couldn't? And come on, that premise! A Selection, but with boys. Call me silly, but I couldn't wait to see how that turned out. Boy, do I regret it. And boy, do I wish I'd never thought it would make up for the mess that was The One. Because you think America was bad? She has nothing, and I mean NOTHING, on Eadlyn. All the Reasons Eadlyn is a Total Fucking Mess. 1) This quote: Had I been born a generation earlier, it wouldn't have mattered. Ahren was the male, so Ahren would have been the heir. Alas, Mom and Dad couldn't stand to watch their firstborn be stripped of a title by an unfortunate but rather lovely set of breasts. So they changed the law, and the people rejoiced, and I was trained day by day to become the next ruler of Illea. What they didn't understand was that their attempts to make my life fair seemed rather unfair to me. This is the first instance of complaining our MC does, followed quickly by \"I can't complain\". Immediately, I felt uncomfortable reading about her: yes, your life is so hard because one day she's going to rule a country. ONE DAY. Not now, not tomorrow, or next week or next month or even the year after. One day, in the future, it's going to be hers. She has all the time in the world to prepare, but it's unfair because she doesn't get to be like the other girls. FYI: She does, too. Eadlyn spends more time getting massages, tanning and sketching dresses than actually 'working' -- and I use that term loosely. Because although she's mentioned what she does, we're never shown her actually doing said job. And can we talk about that last line? It's unfair that her parents gave her a chance to become queen. It's unfair that she has to shoulder the responsibility. It's unfair she gets a chance that no woman in the history of Illea has ever had before. Way to backhand feminism right in the kisser. Bearing in mind that America, in the first two books at least, was a champion for giving women equal rights. 2) She is a bratty, whiny, self-centred little cow. Eadlyn is constantly bitching and whining. If it isn't about her future responsibilities, it's about her current responsibilities. If it isn't about Josie, it's about Josie's brother, Kile. If it isn't about her family, it's about the palace, the restrictions, the rules, the food, the drinks, the lack of freedom. It's absolutely pathetic. I'm sure this was done so we'd feel sorry for her, but actually, all I wanted to do was bitch slap her hard. Her people are rioting, they despise her, and she's moaning about how the palace guards are beneath her. Or, really, how everyone in the bloody world isn't worthy of her attention. \"What if you said you were already in love with somebody?\" I shook my head as I poked at my food. \"I insulted my three most likely candidates right in front of them.\" [...] \"Perhaps a guard then? Happens to the maids often enough,\" she suggested with a giggle. I scoffed. \"That's fine for them, but I'm not that desperate. \" \"Thisis strange,\" I said, picking up one of he applications. \"I don't want to be judgmental, but look at this. I caught three different spelling mistakes for this one.\" Mom took the form. \"It's possible he was nervous.\" \"Or an idiot,\" I offered. \"My father used to be a Two.\" \"Is that all?\" Undeterred, he went on. \"I think it's pretty impressive.\" \"Not as impressive as having a father who used to be a One.\" \"Mark is a chemist. He's studying biochemistry, specifically.\" My eyes widened. \"Really? Such a range in your professions.\" She frowned. \"There's no caste system anymore, Your Highness. People can date and marry anyone they want to.\" I turned away from the mirror to look at her directly. \"That's not what I mean. It's simply intriguing to me the dynamic you must have. You have my laundry in your arms, and he might cure a disease. Those are two incredibly different roles in the world.\" Need I go on? Eadlyn is selfish and self-centred. At one point, she's so jealous of her brother's relationship with Camille, the princess of France, that she tries to make him choose so he won't leave her. I swallowed, daring to say what I'd been deliberating over for a very long time. \"Look, Ahren, she's a great girl. There's no denying it. But maybe she's not the one.\" His smile finally faltered. \"What do you mean?\" \"Just that you might want to consider other options. There are so many eligible girls in Illea that you've completely bypassed. Don't rush into something that you can't undo. If you and Camille broke up, it would be nothing. If you got divorced, we could lose our alliance to France.\" Ahren stared at me. \"Eadlyn, I know you're hesitant to fall in love, but I know how I feel about her. Just because you're scared--\" \"I'm not scared!\" I insisted. \"I'm trying to help you. I love you maybe more than anyone. I'd do nearly anything for you, and I thought you'd do the same for me.\" If she loved him as much as she says she does, she would want him to be happy. She wouldn't ask him to break up with her and put his life on hold because Eadlyn wasn't happy. She treats her maid like shit. Constantly putting her down and dismissing her ideas, even after she said Neena was like a friend or a sister. Besides the simple giving and responding to orders, we hadn't spoken much lately, and I had to admit, it was hard on me. Hard on HER. After treating her maid like shit, it's hard on Eadlyn. God forbid Neena may have feelings! 3) She's a Mean Bitch. She treats her Selected like shit, too, dismissing and humiliating them PUBLICLY. Like all great princesses would, right? Because holding up and image and being courteous means nothing, right? \"Why were you so harsh? For a few you simply said 'no' or flicked your hand.\" I tried not to let the worry show on my face. At the time those things had seemed kind of funny. Oh yes, because making possible suitors CRY and humiliating them on camera is HILARIOUS. HARHARHAR!!!!1!!!one! She throws a pissy whenever the attention isn't on her, and enjoys taking the piss out of a fifteen year old girl who idolises her. \"Kile, could you please go talk to your sister?\" The contentment in his eyes quickly turned to frustration. \"Why? What'd she do this time?\" \"She's taken yet another one of my tiaras.\" \"Don't you have, like, a thousand of those?\" I huffed. \"That's hardly the point. It's mine, and she shouldn't be wearing it. When she walks around like that, she gives the impression that she's royal when she's not. It's inappropriate. \" SHE'S FIFTEEN AND HAS KNOWN EADLYN HER WHOLE LIFE. Josie idolises her and tries to be like her, but Eadlyn constantly mocks her publicly and humiliates her! 4) She's a Mean Bitch & Then Wonders Why Everyone Hates Her And the real fucking kicker: The public hates Eadlyn, and she can't figure out WHY. More provinces are protesting the monarchy than you could guess. Not all of them, but plenty. And while it pains me to tell you this, the problem people have with the monarchy stems from one person: you. Her people hate her. They throw rotten vegetables and eggs at her when she parades by, they start riots and scream about needing jobs. But Eadlyn's biggest worry? \"Oh no, I have to choose a potential husband.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Don't talk to me like that, Eadlyn. I'm fourteen, not four. I read all the papers, and I pay attention at the Reports. I speak more languages than you, and I'm learning all the things you have without anyone making me do it. Don't act like you're better than me. I'm a prince.\" I sighed. \"Yes, but I will be queen,\" I corrected, sipping my coffee. I really didn't need this right now. \"And your name will be in a history book one day, and some bored ten year old will memorize it for a test and then forget all about you. YOu have a job, just like everybody in the world. Stop acting like it makes you more or less than anyone else.\" Her FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BROTHER would be a better ruler than Eadlyn! He who studies because he wants to, he who never complains about the workload, he who works TEN TIMES HARDER than his sister, the future queen. That is shameful. 6) She's Goddamn Boring In The Selection , the girls had to complete certain tasks to compete for Maxon's affections. Tests, reports, projects, parties, the lot. It was fun to read about! I was always excited to see what each group would do. But in <+++>The Heir</+++> , none of that happens. Instead, Eadlyn chooses to belittle the boys and bully them so that they feel intimidated by her. They do nothing at all to gain her affection, unless it's a group date. Which was great the first time, but the second and third? Not so much. 7) The Selected are so Beneath Her, that She Doesn't Even Try to Get to Know Them \"Eadlyn.\" I looked at Dad, trying not to be moved by the pleading in his eyes. \"You promised me three months. We're trying hard to brainstorm on our end, but we can't extinguish that fire if we're dealing with new ones. I need you to try.\" And, essentially, that is the crux of the matter. Eadlyn wants everything given to her on a silver platter, but she doesn't even try to be a) a good person, b) a desirable bride-to-be, c) a good future queen. I'm so done talking about her, but there is so much I want to say. It's ridiculous. I haven't despised a main character this much since... well, ever. Throughout the book, all I wanted to do was strangle her. I can't stand it when MCs are self-centred, selfish, whiny and bratty. Not to mention that she's a twisted little shit, too, pitting the guys against each other until they break out into fights. The writing was lacking. Full of 'we gazed warmly at each other', lots of 'I cock my head pensively/prettily/confusedly/politely'. There was no feeling -- it all felt really empty and forced. The Selected guys were lovely but, of course, there had to be a violent asshole and a would-be rapist in their midst, right? BECAUSE ALL MEN ARE VIOLENT, RAPEY DICKWADS. Really? Fucking really?! And can I just say, she dismissed someone because he was sweating when they first met? NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO BE NERVOUS EVER. You might hang. Eadlyn was so condescending at times that I wanted to hit myself. She is shocked when her lifelong enemy turns out to be actually intelligent with life aspirations. She's surprised that people from different castes find love and can stand to be around each other. She's hurt and disgusted when people retaliate against her bad attitude. Are any of those really that surprising? Jesus Christ. The endgame love interest is so obvious it hurts. This would've worked so much better if it had been about those two overcoming their irritation for each other and falling in love, rather than... THIS. And that ending? That was the cheapest fucking cliffhanger I've ever read in my life. It ended so abruptly, that when I saw the acknowledgements, I thought I'd accidentally skipped a bunch of chapters. It was stupid. Even though I really shouldn't be, I'm disappointed. More than I'd care to admit. I really hoped The Heir would be good, but Eadlyn ruined it. Any part that might have seemed fun or interesting or sweet was overshadowed by her shitty personality. EDIT: 23/10/2014 We have a blurb! Twenty years ago, America Singer entered the Selection and won Prince Maxon\u2019s heart. Now the time has come for Princess Eadlyn to hold a Selection of her own. Eadlyn doesn\u2019t expect her Selection to be anything like her parents\u2019 fairy-tale love story. But as the competition begins, she may discover that finding her own happily ever after isn\u2019t as impossible as she always thought. \"Fairy-tale love story\"? That... Really?! EDIT: 29/09/2014 WOW GUYS! My first ever 100 likes! I'm flattered that you guys find my internal ramblings amusing, much love to you all. <3 <3 <3 How? Why? HOW? Because, Aly, it seems that this MAY be one of those series that are continued for no reason. WHY? BECAUSE, Aly, it seems that people don't know when to leave well enough alone! BUT HOW? *sigh* Obviously,even though all the issues were, ahem, \"resolved\" in the last book, shit needs to be dragged out as much as possible. So have another book. BUT IT'S TWO MORE. NOT ONE. TWO. Well OBVIOUSLY it's a-- DON'T SAY IT A mon-- SHUT UP! You know it's true! It's a trend! It's okay to poop out more books in a series because of moneh. I told you not to say it! Sorry. You're not sorry. Don't lie. Question is, will you read it? After the shitfest that was The One ? *Sighs* Probably. Well you're a fucking idiot then. *Sadface* I know. You disgust me. I regret nothing. You'll regret this. I know you will. You will cry and complain and hiss like a diabolical cat on acid and then you will write an angry review but you will, no doubt, read the fifth one, too. And you'll regret that one, as well. It's a vicious circle. You should quit now that you're ahead. *glares* Don't patronise me. You can't handle the truth, can you? ... I don't like you very much. The feeling's mutual. Suck it up, buttercup. Just another episode of Inside Aly's Brain. ...more Fixed the cover I did a full booktalk for this ages ago..... I FORGOT TO MARK IT AS FINISHED. HERE'S THE BOOKTALK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTIIV... JUST WHEN GILLIAN THOUGHT SHE WAS A FREE ELF Eadyln is definitely not America. And I could not be happier. Thank you, Cass, for giving me a princess I can root for. I read the Selection series for Maxon (<---B>who didn't?</---B>) and it was refreshing to find myself drawn toward the protagonist for once. Now, some people are going to hate her. Eady comes across very spoiled and selfish at first glance, but whereas America was wishy-washy and driven by a constant state of indecision, Eady knows what she wants and doesn\u2019t apologize for it. And I for one f Eadyln is definitely not America. And I could not be happier. Thank you, Cass, for giving me a princess I can root for. I read the Selection series for Maxon (who didn't?) and it was refreshing to find myself drawn toward the protagonist for once. Now, some people are going to hate her. Eady comes across very spoiled and selfish at first glance, but whereas America was wishy-washy and driven by a constant state of indecision, Eady knows what she wants and doesn\u2019t apologize for it. And I for one found that rewarding. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess I thought, if you ever did get married, it\u2019d be down the line. I think everyone assumed that\u2026 Come on, Eady. You\u2019ve always been independent. It\u2019s the queen in you. You like to be in charge, do things on your own. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d partner up with anyone unless you at least got to reign for awhile.\u201d YES. Eady represents something society either hates or loves. She sends eleven suitors packing on public display without the slightest hesitation, or the slightest bit of sympathy. The newscaster labels her the \u201cblack widow\u201d for her heartless display. But really, how is it heartless? Society wanted her to pretend to get know all of them when really she was doing her heart a favor. She sent the lewd ones packing and if she knew she had no chemistry she didn\u2019t see the point in dragging the charade out. This scene reminded me of Brad Womack on his first season as The Bachelor \u2013everyone in the public eye condemned him for not picking DeAnna but why? Because at the end of the show he didn\u2019t love her enough to propose? That took guts that he didn\u2019t want to lie to her like every other winner does on the show, proposing and then calling things off before the final episode where they flash forward months later. Eady is Brad. Her response to the angry public was perfect: \u201cI only have one heart, and I\u2019m saving it.\u201d Now, let\u2019s talk about the basic plot and how messed up it really was. Obviously the fans wanted more Selection books so Cass had to find a way to bring it back. But then came America's bone-headed argument for subjecting her daughter to another ordeal: \u201cEadlyn, darling, we want you to be the best queen you can be, that\u2019s all.\u201d REALLY????? I get that they are trying to distract the country with a show but I hated lines like that. It made it seem like her parents thought she needed a man to rule. \u201cI will,\u201d I answered, \u201cand I certainly don\u2019t need a boy to show me how to do that.\u201d SERIOUSLY, THIS IS WHY I LOVE EADY AND HATE HER MOTHER. Honestly, the only part I liked her parents was Maxon\u2019s sad attempt at baseball (when he pointed to a spectacular hit and then missed all the pitches, that was ROFL hilarious). Or let\u2019s talk about the obvious lead love interest. For Eady we give her (in my mind) hot, hipster-architect anti-royal Kile. He is the Dimitri to her Anastasia. I love him, I love their bickering, but I did not love (view spoiler) [how quickly they got together, or how as soon as they kissed she wanted to make out with him all the time, or that really awkward description of first kiss about the \u201cmouths\u201d \u2013was it just me? (hide spoiler) ] Nevertheless even with their problems I admired how they still argued on a routine basis like Dimitri-Anastasia and they had this \u201clet\u2019s pretend we won\u2019t fall in love\u201d relationship (since he wants to leave palace and she doesn\u2019t want to marry): \u201cIf I need advice, I talk to my parents. If I need a friendly ear, I have Ahren. You were helping for a minute [kissing me], and then you had to start with the questions.\u201d What\u2019s not to love about a girl that's in denial? Makes for the cutest clich\u00e9s. So if I enjoyed this book why isn\u2019t it five stars? Because the romance was somewhat lacking. I didn\u2019t root for Kile as hard as I could because he and Eady were too quick to start making out, so to speak. I would have preferred more build up or drama between those two instead of an automatic \"friends with benefits\" situation. I think I loved Maxon a bit more because he was less readable. He and America were a bit more romantic. That said, this is a four star read because I found the plot more enjoyable than America's tale, and I really liked the main character (for once). I am ready for the next book, now please.

I think that's because Eadlyn was insufferable and I wanted to punch her EVERYTIME. She's bratty, spoiled and whenever someone disagrees with her, she tells them she'll be the future queen (as if they have to shut up for that reason). I don't really hate her, but I don't like her at all. At first I didn't like any of the selected boys and I had a hard time remembering who was who, but now I kind of like Henri... and that's it.

Ean is interesting, too. Kile and Hale are too clich\u00e9 for me, and the whole Erik thing isn't working for me either. I thought I knew who Eadlyn would choose, but now I'm not sure... Another thing that bothered me was what Ahren did at the end of the book! UGH! He was one of my favorite characters, but then he had to do THAT! Like... WHY? He could've talked to his parents about it and they would've been understanding and supporting to him! He didn't need to be all secretive about it. What he did was STUPID. Maxon saved the book for me. I loved seeing him in daddy mode, but I'm so worried about him :(. So much pressure in his shoulders, and then what happened at the end was a fatal blow for him! I just want to hug him and tell him everything will be alright! So... characters I liked in this book: Maxon, Kaden, Henri, Ean, Aspen... and that's it. America was alright, but I felt her so out of character, maybe that's because she's now the queen and she has really changed (for good). I'll definetly be reading the next book. <---A>Kiera Cass</---A> has this thing that I can't stop reading her books! They're addicting! And this one wasn't the exception. ...more Basically.

But then she\u2019d do something that would make me laugh, or something so outrageous whilst totally owning it, and I totally fell in love with her.

No one was more powerful than me.\u201d The storyline in this was about Eadlyn taking part in a selection (against her will), and the calamities that ensued. The new problems in Illea, and the unrest that Maxon didn\u2019t know how to fix. \"I looked down.

Hale dropped down and lay in front of me, wrapping an arm around my shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got you.\u201d And gosh, I don\u2019t know who she\u2019s going to pick! There\u2019s one boy who grew on both me and her, but is it too predictable if they end up together? There\u2019s the guy that\u2019s not even part of the selection, but seems to have caught the Princess\u2019 eye. And then there\u2019s the guy who\u2019s sweet, but has a bit of a language barrier. Would that ever work? I don\u2019t know!! \"You seem shut off in a way, disconnected from your people. I know you're constantly worried about the demands you will face as queen, but it's time you see the needs of others.\" And so the ending! And what an ending it was! I loved the twists in this story, totally loved them, but dear me, please don\u2019t hurt a person who we all love Kiera Cass! Please! I cannot wait for the next book.

Eadlyn had a lot of potential but unfortunately she failed my expectations. From the first moment I thought she was selfish, whiny and quite heartless. Meanwhile I thought she'll redeem herself later on. No such luck. Eadlyn continued to complain about having way too much work to do and having the weight of the world on her shoulder. At the same time she left all decisions to Maxon, which was fine because he was the king after all, but then why wouldn't she stop bitching about the amount of pressure she was under? Allegedly she had to learn a lot and she didn't understand maths... woah I feel so sorry for her. (view spoiler) [Next to this, she was egocentric to the level that she tried to manipulate her own brother to get what she wanted. (hide spoiler) ] I'm sorry but I just couldn't relate to her. \"No one was more powerful than me.\" - she says this soo many times that I can't even count. I was still hoping for great character development but I never got it. Eadlyn did change throughout the novel but the biggest change happened at the very end. It wasn't only unrealistic but rushed too. It felt wrong to me that something so drastic had to happen to make Eadlyn realise how wrong she was. The romance was predictable and bored me to no end. From the very first moment we met the guys it was obvious who'll have a chance with Eadlyn. What I hated the most about this was how patronizing she was to all of them, besides the one guy who'd have really deserved it. (view spoiler) [ She did her first elimination in front of the cameras and wasn't a tad bit nice about it, you can say she ashamed those guys in front of the whole country. (hide spoiler) ] I was surprised to see that she had no idea why people dislike her. Jeez, I don't understand either, can you help me out here? I never thought it's possible to have 35 guys and not be interested in any of them, but that's how I felt while reading The Heir. I'd go as far that I don't think I like any of these guys. I feel like I don't know anything about them besides their names and a few non-important things. I get that it must be hard on the author to introduce us to so many new characters but at least one or two guys could have got more attention. While it is obvious which guys Eadlyn prefers at the moment I don't see myself shipping them in the next book. What I liked in America and Maxon was always their banter and cute scenes, so far none of these happened here. I feel like these guys are either batshit afraid of Eadlyn or don't care about her at all. I wanted a guy to tell Eadlyn when she's wrong and tell her to go screw herself when she put him in an awkward situation. Did this happen? NO. Also, don't look for chemistry between the characters, there's none. There were so many supporting characters besides the guys, and I felt like even Cass forgot about them once in a while. Josie was made to look sort of important in the beginning but then she was completely forgotten, as I'm sure she is in there. Ahren and Eadlyn's younger brothers were casually mentioned here and there and appeared to eat but not much than that. I was surprised to see that I didn't like Marlee at all. (view spoiler) [I was mortified when I realised that she wants to force her son, Kile to stay at a place he doesn't feel at home. (hide spoiler) ] It was wrong on so many levels that I just can't deal with it. Eadlyn's maid appeared at the right times for Eadlyn to hurt her feelings but at least she did told her what a little bitch she was. Have I mentioned before that Eadlyn can't take critic to crazy levels. Whenever someone said something to her that she didn't like she became mad as hell and hated on the said person. Eadlyn's lovely words to her maid: \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. It\u2019s simply intriguing to me the dynamic you must have. You have my laundry in your arms, and he might cure a disease. Those are two incredibly different roles in the world.\u201d Obviously, this novel wasn't all bad. I pretty much loved Ahren and thought he was unbelievably cute with Camille (his girlfriend). Also, he was a great brother, who Eadlyn should have appreciated more. She never once asked Ahren what was up with him, meanwhile she expected him to not only listen to her whining but agree with her all the time. There really were many amazing and emotional parts. Unfortunately, none of them could been thanked to Eadlyn. Maxon was as sweet as ever and America seems like a nice queen. This part: \u201cMy father has never so much as swatted my hand, and he\u2019s always taught us to seek peaceful resolutions. Ahren and I gave up trying to fight each other before we could really talk.\u201d Despite my review I don't think fans will dislike the book, actually I heard that some enjoyed it more than the previous books. As for me, my hatred toward Eadlyn was the thing that ruined the book for me, thus I can't give it more than three stars, even though that breaks my heart because, as you could have seen in my review of the original trilogy, I love The Selection. PS: I know The Selection got a lot of attack for being anti-feminist but I wouldn't call this book completely feminist either. While Eadlyn was right in that no woman needs a man to be a queen, both literally and rhetorically speaking, no woman should make a man feel like shit and less than her somehow. Feminists, as far as I know, are fighting for equality. I believe forcefully that a woman is nowhere less than a man BUT men are no less than women either and should never be treated as such. What Eadlyn did was disgusting and horrible and I can not like her for standing up for women this way. The story idea: 3/5 The realisation of the story: 3/5 The characters: 2/5 The cover: 5/5 Enjoy factor: 4/5 Final Rating: 3/5 BEFORE READING: THAT COVER *-* WHAT IS THIS? IS THIS REAL? OH MY GOD GUYS THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER! I can't believe that this is really happening. I bet it will be about Maxon and America's kid because seriously: The Heir. I can't freaking control myself. And May 5th isn't that much far away... I guess. Wait it's still 9 months, nine freaking months away! But I'm still like: This better be freaking amazing or else...[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more YOU GUYS.

I know you fall asleep each night wondering. WONDER NO MORE. The answer has arrived. Yes. Yes, such a book can exist! And it is this one. ARE YOU READY FOR THIS? First, it is worth noting that on top of the problems that plagued earlier books in this series, this book has spectacularly awful timing, coming out, as it does, in the midst of the Baltimore situation. Unlike The Hunger Games, which for all its fault really touched on the cultural zeitgeist, this book is uniquely tone deaf in light of our current national crises. Okay, let's begin with the text! You thought America was dumb? Wait till you meet her daughter Here is how we meet Eadlyn. I COULD NOT HOLD MY breath for seven minutes. I couldn\u2019t even make it to one. I once tried to run a mile in seven minutes after hearing some athletes could do it in four but failed spectacularly when a side stitch crippled me about halfway in. Eadlyn has made me hate her in well less than seven minutes\u2026more like seven seconds. GOOD WORK. I mean, does Eadlyn/Cass think that some magical beings can just suddenly run a mile in 4 minutes? No. You train to run. Only some people can do a seven minute mile on their first try. For the rest of us, you work at it. Something with which a princess should be familiar. This does not bode well for Our Heroine, who apparently gives up immediately when she can\u2019t do something on the first try. Alas, Mom and Dad couldn\u2019t stand to watch their firstborn be stripped of a title by an unfortunate but rather lovely set of breasts. I . . . what? Girl babies are not born with breasts. If you are trying to go in this direction, just come out and say it: she had a vagina when she was born. Not breasts. Also, the reason to make your firstborn heir regardless of gender is called EQUALITY. Because women are just as capable of ruling as men. Not because breasts strip you of your title. Cause and effect fail. So, apparently Eadlyn and her father Maxon (I see he\u2019s still a bit dim too) get their news from the newspaper. Read this again. THE RULERS OF A NATION GET THEIR NEWS FROM THE NEWSPAPER. News is at least 12 hours old when it is printed. WHY DON\u2019T THEY HAVE A SITUATION ROOM IN THE PALACE? Can you imagine if Obama did it? Here, let my friend Elisa MacHeart show you what Obama would look like as the ruler of Ilea. \u201cObama woke up and read the newspaper. More riots, apparently. Well. That would not do. Or it would. Hard to tell whose side to be on. \u201cMr. President,\u201d a voice said, knocking on his door, \u201ctime for your briefing.\u201d \u201c'No need!\u201d said Obama. \u201cI read the paper.\u201d Thus finished with knowing what was going on in the world, he put on running shoes to see if he could maybe suddenly beat the fastest mile time in the world. Okay, moving on. Apparently, no laws were created to outlaw discrimination. Also, Maxon and America dismantled the castes without having any kind of ministry, department, or bureau in place to help ease the transition. Eadlyn makes a weaksauce attempt to suggest it now (SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER), saying, \u201cIn my heart I knew complaints would come in faster than anyone could address them, but I also knew Dad couldn\u2019t bear doing nothing.\u201d \u2026.WHAT IS THIS. She has NO concern for her people. She only cares that her father isn\u2019t \u201cdoing nothing\u201d because that would hurt his feefees, not that even addressing SOME injustice is better than addressing none. Christ, what an asshole. It gets worse. Within the span of about 2 pages, Eadlyn tries to do the budget (but she\u2019s bad at math lol cuz SHE\u2019S A GIRL), and then talks about how much she loves having \u201cdessert flown in just because it\u2019s a Thursday.\u201d The cognitive dissonance must be really painful for her. (To be clear: girls are allowed to be terrible at math, I am in fact terrible at math. But Cass specifically sets up Eadlyn to be bad at it, while her twin brother is great with numbers. In a cultural vacuum, this would just be a character trait and be fine. Unfortunately, we live in a society where girls are routinely said to be worse at math, to be inherently less capable of STEM jobs, and so on. You cannot divorce a work of fiction from the context in which it was written. This is just playing into the stereotype that girls cannot do math, and that is a real and damaging stereotype.) Another thing that Ahren is better at: realizing that you can negotiate with your parents. How did Eadlyn not realize this immediately, instead of screaming, \u201cYOUR\u2019E RUINING MY LIFE?\u201d Doesn\u2019t every teenager figure this out by the time they are 13? \u201cCome home by midnight.\u201d \u201cOne o\u2019clock, but I\u2019ll call at 11!\u201d She was ostensibly raised as the heir to a nation\u2014and she can\u2019t figure out this one tiny thing? Ilea, I weep for you. To be continued as soon as I've gotten drunk enough to handle the awful writing and logic fails. ...more Edit 24.10.2014.

Overall I don't even feel like this edition needed to be written because it really didn't add anything that wasn't already there. Eadlyn the heir to the throne and our leading lady, is a total bitch. I know a lot of people will say \" oh well she has her reasons \", but I disagree. She was malicious at times for no real reason. Being a brat doesn't make you a strong women. It takes more courage to stay delicate in a world that cruel. And yeah, I've read snotty characters before and loved them and this just wasn't the case for Eady. Her constant complaining got to be far to much for me to ever feel a connect with her. One of the contestants even tells her shes a stubborn self-centered brat and I think he nailed it. As far as America and Maxon, her parents and the leading characters from the first three books, too me feel completely different than how they were before. I was so excited to get even just a little taste of them in this book and was again let down. America went from this strong, amazing role model for girls to this empty shell. Same basically goes for Maxon too. Sadly both felt rather unrecognizable. As far as her male suitors went... Again a let down. When she finally starts going on dates I thought I was about to get excited and would have a guy I could start cheering for.... and that never happens. We get so little time with them. There wasn't one I was super swooning over, or one that made my heart skip a beat. And actually a lot of them were kind of dicks. I'm more than certain that anyone who picks this book up will know who she will end up with ( it can really only be between two. One is a bit predictable the other is who you'd want which again is kind of obvious ). No, this isn't an open and close read it's left on a \"cliff-hanger\". Which I HATED! I wish I could give you even a little bit of a plot summary, but can't because there's not much of one. Basically we gets 300+ pages of Eady repeating the same sentence, stomping her feet, then caving a little here and there. If you start reading this, and then do like I did, and kept saying and waiting thinking there has to be some \"WOW moment\" that really makes this book complete, I'll sadly tell you that you'll be waiting forever. I wouldn't of even given this book the rating I did if it wasn't for her brother Ahren. He too me was the only highlight of this book. I loved him! I did find it was a little ridiculous that he understood what true feminism was over his sister. Found myself wishing that he was the heir and that we would have gotten the book from his sweet POV. \"You can be brave and still be feminine. you can lead and still love flowers. Most important, you can be a queen and still be a bride.\" Truly let down by how this book went. It had all the potential to be great and then just drug it's feet. Hoping the next one goes balls to the wall.

I loved that the family played a big role in this book. Loved seeing Maxon (obviously) and even America. I also enjoyed that there's not really a clear front runner for her selection and there's quite a few guys that I think it could be. However, my biggest issue comes with the end. It was so rushed. The main focus had been the selection process and then all of a sudden it wasn't? I just didn't see where the turn of events came from. I know there's still another book to come but I felt this one was very introductory, not much happened, and there were too many loose ends. I still enjoyed it but not as much as the previous books. ...more WTF did I just read? I was so excited to finally get my hands on The Heir!!

I was very disappointed. The story was dragging and Eadlyn was HELLA annoying. It was mostly Eadlyn struggling with a pompous ego and indecisiveness as she was continuously rude to the boys; and Maxon's and America's terrible parenting skills as they used their daughter as a diversion to solve their country's problems. I just couldn't get myself to want to know what would happen next. It didn't interest me. I didn't even care who would win Eadlyn's heart. It will probably be...what's his name? Kyle? Karl? Kevin? or was it Erin? IDGAF. I just wanted to get it over with and finish the book. I do wish Kiera Cass just ended The Selection Series with The One. Although I am not expectant of the next Selection book to be published, I will read it because Kiera Cass wrote it. ...more I'm loving Eadlyn's character development so far!

This is Goodreads, and what I like about this community is how everyone has different opinions about books and can share them to others. I don't think this will be the best or worst review. There's some that I've read that are actually worse than this one, and some that defend everything and make sure others try to change their thoughts about it. I give them my applaudes! But I am someone who enjoys reviewing books in her own thoughts and opinions and if that is something you don't like, please do not continue. You can be brave and still be feminine. You can lead and still love flowers. Most importantly, you can be queen and still be a bride. Why did I choose that quote? Because this review will mostly focus on one name: Eadlyn. I've heard much about The Selection series and to start off, I wasn't the biggest fan of the first book. The One was my favorite and in my opinion, and like others, it should've been the last book in the series. Everything made sense and came to an end in that one. Sure there were times where the words kids or children were mentioned, but even with that, it could've been left with us questioning the book after. I mean, a lot of us actually did. What would the funeral for the King and Queen be like? How would America and Maxon's kids look like? Would Celeste have a glamorous funeral? Will Aspen and Lucy get married? What will happen with Marlee? Will The Selection continue or will everything completely change in this book? Having part of those questions answered, I now come to wishing Kiera never published this book and The Crown. In my opinion, this is a different series. It's like a spin-off I suppose. But having my opinion reach a better level, I just wish it ended with The One. The ending was the one we were looking for since the first book. It started off with America entering The Selection when she didn't want to. Then we get to the part where she meets Prince Maxon, they start talking and gushing over each other. Second book comes around. King Clarkson does not like America and wants her eliminated because she is stubborn and not who he wishes to see in his palace. In his opinion, she is nothing like the other girls and is someone not worthy of Maxon's care. Coming to their journey in The One, Maxon finds out about her relationship with Aspen, Celeste and America become friends only ending up being their friendly moment together, and Kriss was about to be chosen until the shooting happened again. Maxon is taken to the hospital, the King and Queen die leaving everything to the charge of the Heir who is obviously Maxon and as to the happily ever after, Maxon and America get married. HOORAY! I did not read any of the books when they were released. Sadly, I was not into reading when Kiera published her first one. That follows a sad story from me. Moving on, we come to a book where the main focus and its plot is about Princess Eadlyn Schreave, the Heir to the throne. Can we take a minute and just admire her? Oh wait, there is nothing to admire about her! After finally owning the Heir, I was actually glad I would finally meet these upcoming characters and learn their stories, only ending up wasting my time by reading about a spoiled, rude princess. I get it, she's a princess. She gets what she wants right? That's just royalty and how rich people live right? They get what they want when they want. Well, Eadlyn certainly does. Sometimes having the urge to put this book down and leave it as a DNF book, I forced myself to continue on reading just to see if my thoughts and opinions would change and also because I own The Crown so I kind of need to read this one to understand the final and 5th book right? But instead, I regret purchasing The Crown and wishing I never wasted 3 hours with this book. There weren't any changes. Eadlyn was still a bitch, rude, foolish, stubborn and still very spoiled. She is supposed to be a princess! Now, tell me, is this really how a princess, being the daughter from a gorgeous man that cared for his kingdom when he was only a prince, for his family, his soon-to-be-wife, his people, his country, himself, and being a daughter of a woman that never though she'd become queen, cared for her family the most, didn't want to compete in a competition with other girls over a guy she didn't care for at first because she preferred to stay with her family and make sure they'd be taken care for , is supposed to act? \u201cFox Wesley, Your Highness.\u201d I tilted my head in greeting. \u201cA pleasure.\u201d He took in a breath. \u201cYou are so beautiful.\u201d \u201cSo I've been told. You can go now.\u201d BITCH Um, last time I was taught about how princesses should be taught (don't ask) I remember being told they must be kind, caring, make sure their words are said with wisdom and care, and make sure they talk politely with manners. I mean, yeah there's more to it but that's some of the main points. \u201cHale Garner, Your Highness.\u201d \u201cWelcome sir.\u201d \u201cThank you so much for letting us into your house. I hope to prove myself worthy or your hand more and more each day.\u201d I cocked my head curiously. \u201cReally? And how will you do that today?\u201d He smiled. \u201cWell, today I would let you know I come from an excellent family. My father used to be a Two.\u201d \u201cIs that all?\u201d Underrated, he went on. \u201cI think it's pretty impressive.\u201d \u201cNot as impressive as having a Father who used to be a One.\u201d His face faltered. \u201cYou may go.\u201d Oh for fucks sake! I expected her to be like America, maybe even better and have a different character to play but no! She was the most boring, ignorant, selfish and had no interest in personalities. Being the royal princess she is, she was someone I consider to be the most awful person to read about. \u201cI'm the princess. I have everything.\u201d Yep you sure have it all! You have a horrible attitude, being a princess that thinks she has the strongest power in all of her country. You have so many fucking tiaras yet you cry over one that is taken by a 15 year-old. You think you're making things right when you're making everything worse. You think everyone should love you because of who you are. She thought she was queen already and that's what made me hate her more. Well, I guess that's how I took them. Here are 3 examples: I knew they loved me, of course. I was going to be their queen. \u201cI\u2019m the next queen of Illea. I\u2019m scared of nothing.\u201d Because who was I really? One half of a set of twins. The heir to the throne. One of the most powerful people in the world. The biggest distraction in the country. Yes her people definitely love her! She was saying that when she was with the Selected, standing like the perfect princess she thinks she is with her head high and making sure her tiara wasn't falling until people threw tomatoes and eggs at her. She said she was strong and didn't need to be rescued yet she went crying to her parents and wished everything was over. Hale and Henri even protected her.... Shame. I've never been so upset with a book. In The Selection, all books had their own improvements. The Selection - \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd The Elite - \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The One - \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Honestly, who does Eadlyn think she really is? She isn't queen yet so like calm the fuck down and take a seat in your precious rich seat! Also, another thing that bothered me from Eadlyn is how the text made it seem like she wanted her own mother to fucking die! The Heir, according to Google means: Now, that that's clarified, what I said about her wanting to become queen might just make sense. But if it doesn't, let me make it easier to understand. Eadlyn keeps saying \"she will be queen soon\" or \"the people love me because I'm gonna be queen soon\" or just \"I was going to be their queen.\" Now, that may or may not make sense, but that's okay, I'm not done. If Eadlyn wants to be queen so bad already, why doesn't she just become queen? Oh right because she's just a princess and her mother is currently alive and ruling the kingdom with her husband who is also alive and the King. Because heir obviously means taking the title of the ruler after they are dead (that's actually in my words but whatever) and since Eadlyn keeps telling herself she will queen very soon so that is why she needs to improve her life, in my opinion, she makes it sound like she wants her own mother to be dead already so she can rule and have the kingdom for herself. It's like she wants to rule the whole place and not bother caring what is happening with the country! She makes it seem like her life is so stressful and hard to live in and wishing to be in someone else's shoes. She makes it seem like nobody else has their life to worry about. I'm sorry but her telling herself she is the heir to the throne just makes it seem like she wants America to die. What the fuck!? Now, I think I'm done ranting. Wait I don't know if that's considered ranting actually. Anyways, can I just move on to the actual review now and add things I did not like. Maybe some things I did like as well? Wait there um, there wasn't anything I actually liked so that's checked off. None of the guys really bothered me. They actually seemed interested in Eadlyn, not really realizing her real life and how stuck up she really is. As to the guys she eliminated, well, I don't blame her. Especially the sweaty one, the one who immediately first asked when he gets payed, and the one that just looked at her breasts right away. She's princess I know she must show some cleavage blah blah blah but like, he could've properly introduced himself like everyone else did and not introduce himself by locking his eyes with her breast like nooo man no. Believe me, it upsets me giving this book a 1-star rating when I had both high doubts but good expectations for it. I have heard that her character development grows and changes into someone better and even someone who was actually not expected in the final installment! I own The Crown and can't wait to start it because I do have hopes for it. Most are for Eadlyn but I also want her to choose the right guy. (Please don't tell me who she chose, thank you!) Like I said before, this was a disappointment for me. And believe me, I hate writing negative reviews and rating books a low star, but even if I re-read it, and even after I read The Crown, I don't think much or even anything will change. Instead, depending on how The Crown goes, this book might just decrease. Depends if more is learned and discovered and if more developments happen. A change might happen but it won't be positive. The book was found just plain boring. Everything was boring. The plot was boring. The characters were boring. The dates were boring. None of the characters had developments as well. Maybe they did but I just didn't see them. The romance was nothing like in The Selection. Here, it felt awkward. In the beginning, the dates didn't feel like real and actual dates. The dates didn't feel right for any of the Selected. \u201cI'm smart and beautiful and strong. I don't need to be rescued.\u201d Oh please! As final and overall thoughts, The Heir was nothing like The Selection. Any really! She eliminated contestants right away even when she didn't get to meet them! Nothing felt right and nothing caught my attention. Besides wishing to punch Eadlyn at times, nothing else was found. ...more The Heir is book four in the series The Selection by Kiera Cass.

I have been addicted to these books from the beginning and I loved this new book. It\u2019s been twenty years since the end of the last book. America and Maxon\u2019s first children were twins, Eadlyn and Ahren. Eadlyn was born first so she is the first in line to the throne, The Heir. She is now eighteen years old and has a tremendous amount of responsibility on her shoulders while preparing for the time when she will become Queen. She has watched her parents and the love they so obviously share all her life but she doesn\u2019t feel the need to find that for herself, not yet. The country, even though the caste system has been abolished, is in unrest. There is still much post-caste discrimination and the people are unhappy and blame the royals. While trying to find a solution, Maxon and America convince Eadlyn that she needs to have her own selection. \u201cI\u2019m happy, Ahren. I\u2019m the princess. I have everything.\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019re mistaking comfort for joy.\u201d Eadlyn, especially in the beginning, comes off as a little bit snooty in this book. But as you get to know her, I think she is just extremely introverted. She rarely leaves the castle and has been raised for nothing other than to be the future Queen. She has built an emotional wall around herself and the last thing she is interested in is getting married. Not now and maybe not ever. But she loves her parents and will do as they wish. She\u2019ll have the selection, but with some stipulations of her own. \u201cWho was I really? One half of a set of twins. The heir to a throne. One of the most powerful people in the world. The biggest distraction in the country. Never just daughter. Never just girl.\u201d I loved this book. I didn\u2019t bond with Eadlyn right away like I did America. But it broke my heart to see the way she struggled with her identity. And she thought she knew going in how she would handle the selection. How she would handle the men. But I think the surprise was on her. Can she really keep herself from growing to care at least for some of these men? I already have my own favorite and there were definitely a couple of sighs and maybe even a swoon escaping me as she interacted with him. But there are also a couple of other strong possibilities. One of them might even be a scandal waiting to happen! My one complaint is that this ends in a cliffhanger. There were a couple of shocking incidents at the end but I also liked the changes I was seeing in Eadlyn. Will Maxon find a solution to please the people of his kingdom? Will Eadlyn fall in love and choose a husband? I\u2019m not sure when book five is due out but for me, it can\u2019t get here fast enough. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anyone knows what they\u2019re looking for until they find it.\u201d ...more 3.5 stars I could totally understand why many readers think this entire series is a very weak sort of dystopia.

I bet everyone will agree with me that dystopia and fairy tales aren\u2019t the best of friends, not even polite colleagues but the author played cupid and made these two opposite genres attract and fall crazily in love with each other by creating the world of the Selection, a world definitely unlike Hunger Games, Divergent, etc. but a world which I would willingly enter into. Are you kidding me? 35 hunks (husband scowls behind me), a palace and not to mention awesome food?! While is there anyone who would want a field trip to Panem? I thought so! LoL! What I\u2019m trying to say here is that this series, particularly this installment may not have the most complex plot or impressive world building, but it\u2019s completely entertaining and very appealing which I believe is the very purpose of the author and if you read this purely for its entertainment value, I bet you\u2019ll enjoy this too. Was I annoyed at Eadlyn? Oh boy! I was! I couldn\u2019t count the number of times and the variety of ways I rolled my eyes at the things she said and did but I think her attitude is what made the entire thing more entertaining. Did I think this series is going to be a trilogy? Oh boy, I did! Was I pissed? Yes I was. But guess who was so excited at the knowledge of a fourth book? And guess who is restlessly waiting for the fifth book?

EDIT: THERE IS A SYNOPSIS \"Eadlyn doesn\u2019t expect her Selection to be anything like her parents\u2019 fairy-tale love story\" HA. If I do do remember correctly, there was a ton of unnecessary drama, crying, and fits. ...more \u201cYou know how your mother and I met,\u201d Dad began. I rolled my eyes. \u201cEveryone does.

She's America's daughter and heir to the throne of the ridiculous kingdom of Ill\u00e9a. The first thing you need to know is how unfair life is for Eadlyn. Her parents just disolved the law that said that the male firstborn was going to be the king, and so, now if the firstborn is a girl, she can be queen. Alas, Mom and Dad couldn\u2019t stand to watch their firstborn be stripped of a title by an unfortunate but rather lovely set of breasts. So they changed the law, and the people rejoiced, and I was trained day by day to become the next ruler of Ill\u00e9a. What they didn\u2019t understand was that their attempts to make my life fair seemed rather unfair to me. How unfortunate! But things get worse for our little princess: The people of Ill\u00e9a are not happy. Even after gorgeous king Maxon eliminated the castes, the people seem to be difficult to please. So, what is our amazing queen and king's solution to it all? Another Selection! This time, though, it's for the purpose of finding a husband for Eadlyn. The sole decision of making a Selection was really stupid. I mean, really, what the hell? America pretty much DESPISED that ridiculous contest and now they're holding another one for HER DAUGHTER? However, the stupidness of the book in general is not what made me try to tear my hair. No \u2013 it was Eadlyn. Oh my sweet baby Jesus, how I hated her! She's selfish, arrogant, immature, ____________ [insert all the negative adjectives that come to your mind], etc, etc, etc. First, she believes herself to be the oh-so-perfect model of hygiene. Why? Well, she pretty much criticizes EVERYONE for how they dress: I was about to ask if he did bathe, because he looked like he\u2019d been running away from anything that resembled a bar of soap. Kile\u2019s hair flopped across his eyes as he looked over at me. He was in desperate need of a cut and a shave, and his shirt was too big for him. I didn\u2019t know who I was more embarrassed for: him for looking so sloppy or my family for having to be seen with such a disaster. What the serious fuck? Here's what I have to say: I don't know who I am more embarrased of: Me for reading this book, or Eadlyn for being so ridiculous. If you couldn't guess, by that point, I already wanted to DNF this, but I contained myself from doing so because I couldn't believe how hilariously bad this book was. I wanted to see how much the ridiculousness could last. Spoiler: It was present until the very end. You know how much I hate reading romance. My hatred is genuine, but it is NOTHING compared to Eadlyn's \u201chatred\u201d. No matter how romantic he thought this was, all I could think of were the thirty-five loud, obnoxious, weird-smelling boys who were about to invade my home. Nothing about that sounded magical. That, again, turns out to be bullshit, because some chapters after, she's making out with one of the boys. At first it was for show \u2013 for giving \u201centertainment\u201d to the audience (Katniss and Peeta someone?) \u2013 but then she did it to entertain herself and because she was actually developing feelings. I could have let that pass (because I really don't care if she's in love or not), but later, she shames this girl: If I thought I\u2019d have the slightest attachment to these boys, it would have bothered me that she thought they were here for her. Then again, Josie thought everything existed for her. And the idea that she was so important that her marriage would need to be arranged on her behalf was comical. She could marry anyone off the street and no one would care one way or the other. Why does she say that? Because that Josie was excited at the prospect of having 35 hot boys in her house. She could have left it at that, but it's no enough for her: She has to humiliate her too. \u201cMe, too! I think it\u2019ll be exciting to have all the company.\u201d \u201cYou won\u2019t have any company,\u201d I reminded her. \u201cThese boys are my guests.\u201d She tipped her head like I was stating the obvious. \u201cI know! But it\u2019ll still be nice to have more people around.\u201d \u201cJosie, how old are you?\u201d \u201cFifteen,\u201d she answered proudly. \u201cI thought so. If you really want to, I\u2019m sure you could get out and meet people of your own accord now. You\u2019re certainly old enough.\u201d That girl is not her only victim, because she's awful to her maids too: \u201cMark is a chemist. He\u2019s studying biochemistry, specifically.\u201d My eyes widened. \u201cReally? Such a range in your professions.\u201d She frowned. \u201cThere\u2019s no caste system anymore, Your Highness. People can date and marry anyone they want to.\u201d I turned away from the mirror to look at her directly. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. It\u2019s simply intriguing to me the dynamic you must have. You have my laundry in your arms, and he might cure a disease. Those are two incredibly different roles in the world.\u201d Aaaaaaand with her family: \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me like that, Eadlyn. I\u2019m fourteen, not four. I read all the papers, and I pay attention at the Reports. I speak more languages than you, and I\u2019m learning all the things you have without anyone making me do it. Don\u2019t act like you\u2019re better than me. I\u2019m a prince.\u201d I sighed. \u201cYes, but I will be queen,\u201d I corrected, sipping my coffee. I really didn\u2019t need this right now. She's not only obnoxious to everyone who lives with her, though. She's like that with the selected boys too: \u201cThis is strange,\u201d I said, picking up one of the applications. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be judgmental, but look at this. I caught three different spelling mistakes on this one.\u201d Mom took the form. \u201cIt\u2019s possible he was nervous.\u201d \u201cOr an idiot,\u201d I offered. \u201cWell, today I would let you know I come from an excellent family. My father used to be a Two.\u201d \u201cIs that all?\u201d Undeterred, he went on. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty impressive.\u201d \u201cNot as impressive as having a father who used to be a One.\u201d (Really, wtf? Lol?) The thing is, this girl thinks she's too perfect for anyone. She doesn't think anyone is worth her, when it's really the opposite: She is not worth anyone. All those previous quotes should \u00a1 have proven that she's really immature, but have a look at this: \u201cEadlyn . . . you seem so grown up.\u201d She sighed as she touched my cheek and shoulder and hair, not fixing anything, just checking. \u201cProbably because I am.\u201d She sounds so ridiculous saying that! Like, I couldn't... (let's use that gif again) And now let me present you an irony: She thinks she's the most perfect person in the world, but... \u201cYou look the part. I never really thought I passed for a queen, but you... wholly perfect.\u201d \u201cStop it, Mom. You\u2019re completely adored. You and Dad brought peace to the country. I haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d The poor thing! She hasn't done anything! Eadlyn is also a narrow-minded bitch who cannot accept that someone likes something she doesn't: \u201cSo, what did you think?\u201d he asked, his eyes bright with excitement. \u201cIt was okay. Definitely seen better.\u201d The movie seemed to leave him hyperanimated. \u201cBut the effects were incredible!\u201d \u201cSure, but the story was tired.\u201d He squinted his eyes. \u201cI liked it.\u201d \u201cAll right.\u201d \u201cDoes that make you upset?\u201d I made a face. \u201cNo. It just means you have bad taste.\u201d But perhaps the worst thing about her is how blind she is. I mean... \u201cSo now you\u2019re going to bully me? First you reject me, then you use me for a little snippet of entertainment on the Report, and now I\u2019ve had to spend my entire morning tracking you down after you told me you would meet with me during breakfast.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re one person out of twenty! I have work to do! How self-centered can you possibly be?\u201d Self-centered? Do you even hear yourself when you talk, Eadlyn? She's the one who cannot stop thinking about herself and she's calling everyone else like that? Bullshit. Just... bullshit, Eadlyn. She can't even see that she's the sef-centered one? This book, however, not only has an insufferable MC, but it also has zero world/character building. Like, it has even less that the original trilogy. We never know why people are rioting, we never know how people are adapting to the elimination of the caste system... and worse even, we never get to know any of the boys. Yes, we know some of their names, but their personalities? Isn't that, like, essential ? I mean, doesn't our sweet and lovely MC have to fall in love with one of them? How can she do that if she doesn't know them? Cass, however, is considerate, and gives us something to make up for that: A cliffhanger. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!?!?!?!! A CLIFFHANGER ?!?!!? As if it wasn't enough with 4 books (without counting prequels and such)... But if I look back, I had fun at how utterly stupid and ridiculous this book was, so... should I rate this five stars for pure entertainment value? Looooool, no. I can't even believe I said that \u2013 not even as a joke. This book is 1 star all the way. I still cannot swallow the fact that I read it without burning something. And now, as a price for all of you who read this entire review and are dying because of the headaches Eadlyn's quotes might have caused, have some cake: P.S.: I'm swallowing my own words. Just look at my pre-review to see what I'm talking about. ... Pre-review: Wait, what? Is this a new Selection book? Well, you can guess I will not be reading this, since neither of the previous books captivated me. So this is yet another book on my lost-interest shelf. And now, look at the cover!! Isn't it pretty? No. \"Pretty\" is not enough of a word. It's a fabulous cover. Still not going to read it. I'm not curious in the least. ...more \"You can be brave and still be feminine.

The best thing about the book is how you can never predict who among her suitors will win her heart, because you basically live in her POV. By the way, there are lots of guys you will be torn. This book, as a whole, lives up to my expectations. :) But to be honest, I like The Selection series far better than this book. I like America's conquest to win Maxon's heart. :) But still, The Heir is a great read.

So, after waiting a little less then a year after the original trilogy ended, the unexpected fourth book, The Heir, has been released. And a lot of people who have read the books may be wondering if this book is worth reading. Well, in all honesty, I personally would only recommend you read this book if you are a huge fan of the series. If you just LIKED the first three books, than this book may not be worth you're time. Why would I say that? Because this installment, in practically every way, is frustrating at some point. And this time, it's not just the main character (which I will talk about soon). It was the dystopian aspect, which was actually pretty interesting seeing how things were going after the first three books, but we barely dove into that; the family aspect, I would have liked to learn more about Eadlyn's siblings and not just as one thing; the Selected, we only really focused on three guys mainly instead of a wide scope of all of them, and even then it didn't feel like we got to know ANY of them; and the biggest one for me: Princess Eadlyn herself. Now, if you will allow me, I want to ramble on about our new protagonist. So, I will be honest, I absolutely hated Eadlyn when we first met her. I thought that she was the brattiest and most annoying person ever. She also was so incredibly selfish and close-minded (as she thought of herself as such a powerful figure no one could touch and that she would never let anyone get close to her). However, when I was around maybe the 1/3 point of the book, I saw a tumblr post about Eadlyn and how she is strong with topics that are dealt in our world (if I am lazy and remember, I will link it at some point) that made me not hate her as much (and kind of respect her), but I was still pretty annoyed at her. Around the half-way point, she definitely is less annoying and more tolerable than the first half, but I still had/have a dislike for her. Anyway, back to some more of my thoughts on this book. I loved seeing the characters from the original trilogy reappear in this book, like Maxon and America and many more. I also loved how, like with the first three books in this series, the book is very quick to get through and it is really easy to read. Now, a major grip I have with this book, and it is that(except for the ones that are from the original trilogy), I felt like none of the relationships in this book had any substance to them. Even with Eadlyn and Adren, in which Eadlyn described each other like their other half, feels like nothing to me when I go back to it. (view spoiler) [Oh, and also at the end when Adren leaves his family to marry the French princess (I can't remember her name), it didn't even feel super shocking (maybe a tad bit) because it didn't feel like there was anything to make me feel sad or upset that he left this family (although, America having a heart attack was really surprising (and Maxon and Aspen were being like best bros at the end which I liked)) (hide spoiler) ] So, in the end, I would give The Heir a solid 3/5 stars. Like with Kiera Cass' previous books, this was really easy to fly through. However, it was lacking substance (even more so than previous books) in practically every way, especially with the relationships in this book, with the exception of the ones that are shown from previous installments. I really hope that the fifth book, whatever it will be called, will at least make the relationships feel like there is a lot in them instead of feeling like it is made of nothing. --- Initial reaction: Finally, after not finishing any books for like two, three weeks, I finished one.

Nonetheless, it is interesting to see it from the other side of the coin - \"dating\" dozens of strangers simultaneously while weighing your personal life against your professional life. Eadlyn will undoubtedly rub people wrong, especially considering how charming and endearing her parents were as characters. This IS something that's REPEATEDLY called attention to, so it's just her character and not an example of poor characterization. Basically, we have a flawed protagonist and part of reading is watching her develop alongside the plot. One of the great things about this story was how it pointed out all the double-standards and trappings of being a woman-in-power who has her literal pick of men. Flawed as she is, Eadlyn is constantly defending herself or justifying actions a man in her position wouldn't need to explain himself over. It's absurd, unfair and does contribute to some of her assertiveness and sour attitude. Where as the first three books played the Selection straight and even romanticized it, THE HEIR deconstructs this process while exploring the pressure and fallacy inherent to it. For better or worse, this isn't a rehash of the original trilogy but I'm still curious to see what will amount from it. ...more 3.5 \u2b50s **CONTAINS SPOILER RELATED TO THE PREVIOUS THREE BOOKS.

DO NOT READ IF YOU PLAN ON READING THE SELECTION, THE ELITE, AND THE ONE** As a fan of the Selection Trilogy, I was very much looking forward to The Heir and going along for the ride of another fairytale love story. You can imagine my disappointment finding out that Princess Eadlyn not only wants nothing to do with The Selection but is also basically guilted into it. The country is in unrest after the removal of the caste system and The Selection is brought back as a means of distracting the people. I have two main issues with this book and basically ruined the experience for me. ONE, Eadlyn is a very unlikeable character. Whereas America, yes she could get on our nerves, but she had spunk and Fire! Eadlyn is spoiled, snotty, and rude for the majority of the book. And her reluctance and distance to The Selection process made it really hard to connect to the experience and really root for anyone. TWO, what the hell happened to our beloved Maxon and America!?! I find it incredibly hard to believe that these two raised such a selfish child. They both had such strong and recognizable qualities about them but they were lost in this book. America had ZERO of the fire that I loved so much about her. She basically sat in the shadows and was really nice to everyone. Maxon, while he did some really great things in the past 20 years, we only get to see this tired, run down, aging man. I couldn't even picture them as the same people from the previous books. Ugh! What I did like though were the selected boys! Besides the first couple of meetings, Eadlyn's interactions with them were my favorite part of the book. Some were actually quite charming and funny! There are a handful who I really adore and think would be great matches. Although my heart is already stuck on KILE! Even before he was selected he roped me in :) I will be greatly upset if Eadlyn doesn't choose him lol. I am a sucker for childhood sweethearts. Even though they technically never were, I still get the same kind of vibe from them growing up together. Overall, Cass is undoubtedly a fantastic writer and kept me turning page after page even with a spoiled princess narrating. I did read it in under 24 hours after all! I do have hope that the next book will redeem itself. It has excellent potential with Eadlyn seeming to finally realize the error of her ways and wanting to change on the very last page (of course). Here's to hoping for character growth! So yes, I will be counting down the days till the next installment to find out how Eadlyn's story ends and hopefully choosing my boy :) I will cry if she doesn't!! I know it seems like I didn't like this book but that's not true at all. Even with the issues I had, I did enjoy it quite a lot and I recommend it to anyone who's a fan of The Selection. It's fast paced and addictive and will leave you reeling after that terrible cliffhanger! ...more 3.8 Stars The Selection starts again, this time it's for the Crown Princess of Illea Eadlyn Schreave .. how can I say about this Selection? God help me! I don't even know who will win Eadlyn's heart? Seriously, the Selected boys and their relationship/dates with Eadlyn are cute in different way. The romance is so tiny that make me cannot ship anyone with her fully. She dates and shares her times with a lot of guys! I I I don't know! Who I should ship Eadlyn with? I like more than one! *sigh* OKay, 3.8 Stars The Selection starts again, this time it's for the Crown Princess of Illea Eadlyn Schreave .. how can I say about this Selection? God help me!

I like more than one! *sigh* OKay, although I don't know who Eadlyn gonna end up with. But if I have to choose a side, I gotta say Kile This boy love reading books! He is a stubborn and sassy bookworm. haha. I love that he is the one that not be afriad to scold Eadlyn when she did wrong thing. While other boys are so good and cute to Eadlyn maybe because they aware that she is a princess, but Kile not! He can be her mirror when she behave bad. Not to mention they kind of like childhood enimies turn to lovers. <3 I LOVE their bickering! and he call her Eady *swoon* But I have to complian.. their romance kinda rush. (view spoiler) [ They already kiss! though their love is fake, I know. (hide spoiler) ] Seriously, I want more bickerings or love/hate romance, it will be really fun. More drama in the next book, pls. Anyway, I like other boys, too. I would be okay if it turn out to be another boy, but just have a lot of romance to make me know and ship them eventually. Yeah, I WANT MORE ROMANCE In the next book, pls. I'm also glad I meet Maxon and America again. Yippee! Love King Maxon, he is so hard-working. and the end THE END oh god, I almost cry.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more<---C>Kiera Cass</---C>", "Title": "The Heir"},
