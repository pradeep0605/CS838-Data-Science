{"Comments": "Ah, another <---A>Dave Eggers</---A> book. I keep reading these and I might have to admit to liking his work. This is a book of short stories. Here is why this is a better book than A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius: because the stories he wrote, are short stories. Eggers can\u2019t meander here and there, and up and down before getting to the point. He has to hit it and hit it quick. Like the words themselves are costing him money.

Like a hooker, a prostitute, a woman of the night. He can\u2019t talk about MTV or household layouts, because that\u2019s like getting a hand job and getting walked on while she\u2019s wearing high heels. You can\u2019t afford that! You\u2019re on a budget! What are you going to eat next week? Raman again? Aren\u2019t you tired of Ramen? I mean, you\u2019re freaking 30 years old, you shouldn\u2019t be eating like a freaking 18 year old college student any longer. You should be eating steak, every night. EVERY NIGHT! Then you will die via heart attack at the age of 45. This is the life you should be living. But no, you\u2019re writing short stories, which aren\u2019t half bad, except for that one about the girl that climbed the mountain.<---F> Man, that was a snoozer</---F>. What happened there? Lose your concentration I bet. I actually read a version of that story in a McSweeney\u2019s compilation book. It was boring then too. You just can\u2019t win with me. Don\u2019t even try. ...more I'm sorry, Dave Eggers. I am so, so sorry, because I love you (<---B>yes, personally</---B>), I love AHWOSG, I love You Shall Know Our Velocity, and I love What is the What. But I did not love this book. At first I just thought I didn't like the shift from novel to short story, but I can handle it from Wallace, Alexie, and Fitzgerald, so that can't be it. These are just not very well done. To be honest, I felt like Eggers was coasting on his success here. Once you've published something like AHWOSG, everyone I'm sorry, Dave Eggers.

To be honest, I felt like Eggers was coasting on his success here. Once you've published something like AHWOSG, everyone will pretty much buy anything you write, and find excuses to like it. Which is what I did, for a while... but the truth remains: I read this book once, put it down, and never picked it up again, not even to look at the pretty cover. And I know I sound ridiculous, but the threesome-with-a-one-armed-woman story just bothered the shit out of me on so many levels. ...more Oh, Eggers. I don't want to admit it - but some of these are so close to being good. There were four shorts in particular I enjoyed: \"She Waits, Seething, Blooming\" \"Notes for a Story of a Man Who Will Not Die Alone\" \"About the Man Who Began Flying After Meeting Her\" Up the Mountain Coming Down Slowly\" Or I should say, enjoyed until I remembered Eggers wrote them. Thing is, Eggers has skill as a writer. He's just so much more goddamn full of himself, is the problem, I think. He meanders and he wanders Oh, Eggers.

Thing is, Eggers has skill as a writer. He's just so much more goddamn full of himself, is the problem, I think. He meanders and he wanders and he writes 'ooh, look at me and how I can cleverly turn a phrase,' and then he just pisses me as the reader off and I kind of want to kick him in the face. Maybe that's a bit strong, as reactions go... but that's increasingly how I feel about Eggers. I don't even care if he's some sort of cult hero or something. He's like that group of hipsters that turns your favorite neighborhood dive into some sort of jean short mustachioed insider 'oh, aren't I ironic?' joke... and completely ruin cheap beer. I hate him, I think. I hate him. Fucker. (It doesn't help his cause that I just read You Shall Know Our Velocity not so long ago. Pretentious bullshit, every single word of it. I hate him.) ...more Yeah, this wasn't very good. I like Eggers' other stuff, and I love me some McSweeney's, but this - not so much. They seemed like rough drafts. There's even one (Notes for a Story of a Man Who Will Not Die Alone) that has a great premise, but he doesn't actually write the story, he brainstorms how he would write the story.

I wasn't interested in any of the characters, except (for some reason) Grant from Up the Mountain Coming Down Slowly. That is actually a pretty solid story, but I'm not recommending the rest. I do really respect and appreciate Eggers' aching sincerity, and I think that's worked well for him in his other work. Sorry Dave! I promise to keep reading your stuff! ...more Dave Eggers es uno de los mejores escritores j\u00f3venes norteamericanos del momento. Perteneciente a la next generation , junto a autores de la talla de David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Franzen o Jonathan Lethem, Eggers ha sabido buscarse un hueco entre tan grandes compa\u00f1eros.

Perteneciente a la next generation , junto a autores de la talla de David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Franzen o Jonathan Lethem, Eggers ha sabido buscarse un hueco entre tan grandes compa\u00f1eros. Eggers nos habla en \u2018Guardianes de la intimidad\u2019 del absurdo de la vida contempor\u00e1nea, del sinsentido de la \u00e9poca que nos ha tocado vivir. Mediante frases cortas, precisas y elegantes, Eggers nos deslumbra con sus ideas e inteligencia a la hora de abordar las historias de estos cuentos. Porque Eggers escribe muy bien. Aparte de alg\u00fan que otro cuento experimental, la mayor\u00eda de relatos son de corte convencional, regal\u00e1ndonos escenas realmente memorables. Eggers sabe bien lo que quiere transmitir y sabe llegar al lector en cada uno de sus cuentos, mostr\u00e1ndonos lo que hay en ellos, y m\u00e1s importante, lo que hay m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de ellos. Encuentro varios puntos en com\u00fan en sus cuentos, empezando por la presencia constante de animales, desde caballos hasta ovejas, pasando por extra\u00f1os p\u00e1jaros. Y tambi\u00e9n el comportamiento de los norteamericanos en pa\u00edses extranjeros, como Tanzania, Egipto o Escocia, pero sin dejar de lado las historias que suceden en la misma Norteam\u00e9rica. Eggers busca el Cuento Total, y a fe m\u00eda que en algunos de ellos lo consigue. Rese\u00f1ar tambi\u00e9n los t\u00edtulos de los cuentos, perfectamente escogidos. Estos son los quince relatos incluidos en \u2018Guardianes de la intimidad\u2019: Otra. (**) El protagonista llega a Egipto para pasar las vacaciones, en busca de algo ex\u00f3tico, y cree haberlo encontrado en un gu\u00eda y sus caballos. Lo que significa que una muchedumbre de un pa\u00eds lejano atrape a un soldado que representa a tu pa\u00eds, le dispare, lo saque a rastras de su veh\u00edculo y luego lo mutile entre el polvo. (***) Brev\u00edsimo relato de apenas una p\u00e1gina, y una dura reflexi\u00f3n sobre la guerra vista desde la lejan\u00eda. El \u00fanico significado del agua oleosa. (***) Hand y Pilar se encuentran en Costa Rica para practicar surf. Son viejos amigos. Pilar, con una vida insatisfecha, cree que puede tener algo con Hand. Sobre querer tener al menos tres paredes levantadas antes de que ella llegue a casa. (***) Otro brev\u00edsimo pero significativo cuento. Trepar a la ventana fingiendo bailar. (*****) Mi cuento favorito del libro, en el que se narra el viaje de Fish, el protagonista, para visitar a su primo, que ha tenido otro suicidio frustrado. Fish est\u00e1 conduciendo, abofete\u00e1ndose para mantenerse alerta, y mientras cuenta para asegurarse de que Adam lleva siete. Uno: las mu\u00f1ecas (con una sierra peque\u00f1a contra sus brazos delgados y blancos como el papel). Dos: veneno (bebi\u00f3 cera para el suelo servida en un vaso de tubo transparente). Tres: disparo al est\u00f3mago. O a un lado del est\u00f3mago; la bala le roz\u00f3, atraves\u00f3 la ventana y lleg\u00f3 a la iglesia episcopaliana de la casa de al lado. No hubo muertos ni heridos, pero Adam se sinti\u00f3 tan mal que, cuatro: se apu\u00f1al\u00f3 en la pierna con una cuchilla de carnicero. Cinco: intent\u00f3 meter un secador de pelo en la ba\u00f1era con \u00e9l dentro, pero por lo visto el aparato era a prueba de suicidios \u2013se apag\u00f3 solo y Adam se qued\u00f3 tiritando en el agua, que se hab\u00eda enfriado mientras \u00e9l reun\u00eda el valor para suicidarse-. Seis: \u00bfcu\u00e1l fue el sexto? \u00bfEmpotrar un coche contra un \u00e1rbol? No qued\u00f3 claro si el accidente hab\u00eda sido intencionado. Espera furiosa, floreciendo. (****) Otro breve cuento, en el que una madre soltera espera impaciente de madrugada el regreso de su hijo. Silencio. (*****) Erin invita a Tom a un viaje por Escocia. Erin le est\u00e1 muy agradecida a Tom por su apoyo en los \u00faltimos meses, y Tom espera mucho de este encuentro. Muy buen cuento, donde salen a relucir ciertos secretos. Tu madre y yo. (**) Peque\u00f1a f\u00e1bula donde un padre cuenta a su hijo todo lo que han hecho por el mundo y la humanidad en su conjunto. Naveed. (***) Stephanie reflexiona sobre las relaciones sexuales que ha mantenido hasta ahora, y no le convence el n\u00famero. Apuntes para un cuento de un hombre que no morir\u00e1 solo. (****) Eggers nos muestra la construcci\u00f3n de un cuento desde el inicio, un cuento que tratar\u00e1 sobre un hombre que no quiere morir solo. Acerca del hombre que comenz\u00f3 a volar despu\u00e9s de conocerla. (**) Pues eso. Monta\u00f1a arriba, en lento descenso. (*****) Rita llega a Moshi, Tanzania, con la intenci\u00f3n de subir a la cima del Kilimanjaro, y siente mucha seguridad en lo que va hacer. Esta ser\u00e1 toda una aventura, donde conocer\u00e1 a la gente del lugar, tan distinta a ella (o no), aventura que le ayudar\u00e1 a decidir sobre su vida futura. Se trata de un cuento impresionante. Hay algunas cosas que deber\u00eda callarse. \u00bf? Cuando aprendieron a aullar. (***) Reflexi\u00f3n sobre las generaciones m\u00e1s recientes, que no hab\u00edan conocido lo que era el Dolor hasta hace bien poco. Despu\u00e9s de que me lanzar\u00e1n al r\u00edo y antes de ahogarme. (***) Esta es la historia de un perro narrada por \u00e9l mismo, un perro al que le gusta correr. ...more \"GOD: I own you like I own the caves. THE OCEAN: Not a chance. No comparison.

His lyrical, casual and yet exacting writing style invites me in closer and then he succeeds in taking me somewhere I've never been before... into absurd conversations with parents, into a dog's joyous mind, into a man's cruel yet understandable desire; all people struggling to find themselves.

Years ago, I read the short story \"After I Was Thrown in the River and Before I Drowned\" (which just so happens to be in this collection) in Nick Hornby's collection Speaking With the Angel and enjoyed it. It wasn't my favorite piece in the collection, but I enjoyed it. I had never heard of Dave Eggers at that point. Shortly after that, I started hearing *a lot* about him.

Friends were recommending him to me, I heard interviews on the radio, read reviews and many, many arguments. I read several issues of McSweeney's and enjoyed them. I enjoyed his editorials in The Best American Non Required Reading series. I bought A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius and couldn't bring myself to read it. (Don't ask me why, but it is still in my 'to-read' pile. I will get to it this year, I swear, but I still can't explain my reluctance to dive into it.) When this collection of short stories came out, I snatched it up. I am a huge fan of short story collections, usually preferring them to novels. Of course, it sat in my to-read pile for quite awhile too. But I finally read it. And I enjoyed it. I particularly liked \"The Only Meaning of the Oil-Wet Water,\" and \"Up the Mountain Coming Down Slowly.\" I think the combination of the intensely personal with the (nicely understated) world politics of class worked very well in these two pieces. I also liked \"Notes for a Story of a Man Who Will Not Die Alone\" for its experimentation. While not the craziest piece I've ever read, it told its own story while pretending to be only a list of possibilities for a story. Many of the other pieces were enjoyable, but also less interesting. What I feel did not work at all were the flash fiction pieces woven throughout. I've read one flash piece by Eggers before (which I can't remember the title of for the life of me) and loved it, but these fell flat, in my opinion. Typically, I am a fan of the genre. A good flash fiction piece is very powerful -- it has to be to work in such a small timeframe. These just didn't feel like they had that power, that punch to them. Overall, I enjoyed the collection and will definitely read more Eggers in the future. Once I catch up, perhaps I can join in on the great Dave Eggers debate. Edit: and p.s. I love the cover, whether the book may be judged by it or not. ...more A criticism I've heard about Dave Eggers is that his stories tend to be gimmicky, overly self-aware, unrealistic, jokey, or filled with dopey sentimentalism.

I especially enjoyed the final story in How We Are Hungry, written from the perspective of a dog, which turned out to be one of the most contemplative and emotional stories of the dozen-or-so in the book. Recommended. ...more The fact that Dave Eggers is a celebrated literary figure and writer is no secret but reading his work, especially How We Are Hungry, always feels like a very private act.

The sparse, punchy prose drive to the heart of what people hunger for: love, acceptance, companionship, approval, that thing they feel will fill that growing hole in the soul. I\u2019m not normally a massive fan of short story collections as I am often left feeling unfulfilled; if the idea and the story is good enough, I (selfishly) want the character\u2019s lives to continue and so I frequently end up feeling short-changed. Here, however, not a single world is wasted in creating small worlds of flawed, fascinating and wholly relatable characters, that feel complete and end where and when they are supposed to. I hope this is not too laboured a metaphor but it often feels like the stories are skeletons for an array of different animals, to which you add your own flesh and colours as you read, creating a personal and intimately reflective zoo. As with much of his other work, Eggers tries to push the art of story-telling a little further. Notes For A Story Of A Man Who Will Not Die Alone, is, as the title says, made up of simple, sketched notes. \u2018Simple\u2019 however does not do the passage justice as it contains as much thought and nuance as the much, and rightly, celebrated Up the Mountain Coming Down Slowly, which at 60 pages takes up a quarter of the book. The apotheosis of Egger\u2019s economy with words is There Are Some Things He Should Keep To Himself, which is the very bare bones of one the skeletons I referred to earlier. For some, I can see that this \u2018story\u2019 might be a step too far, and a step into the land of literary pretension. For my money, Eggars stays on the right side of the line by virtue of the quality, beauty and sheer elegance of his writing, and just as often, the elegance of what he didn\u2019t write. ...more Like your wardrobe, this book is incohesive, comfortable, curious and cozy.

Instead of getting furious because nothing fits together and it's impossible for you to create a suitable outfit, just pause, take a thoughtful second glance, and appreciate that despite it all, you own a collection of hand-selected garments that are individually interesting, eclectic, and varied. Not all of us can show up at the party lookin' all What is the What. I really liked the way the stories alternate from long, involved tales to brief snapshots. Sometimes the stories don't go anywhere, and that's okay. You just float in a moment. Or glimpse a character's thought process. Eventually, you let go of the expectation that the story will lead you, over character archs and surprising plot twists, to a place of resolution and finality. Instead, you appreciate the more subtle parts of excellent storytelling, like details and language and descriptions like, \"the streamlined, utilitarian body of a tomboy teenager.\" Any one of Egger's shorter pieces could be performed at a poetry reading. And maybe they should be. You wonder about his writing methodology. Does he keep a running list of one-line prose poems (\"Climbing to the Window, Pretending to Dance\") and later revisit his list, expounding until it becomes a short story or longer piece of prose poetry? Eggers gets away with things that are hard to pull off, like skipping a description of the setting and instead opting to break from the narrative for a brief dialogue between the clouds and the treetops. Shit, I hadn't even wondered what they were thinking, no less entertained the possibility of these objects as telling, feeling, descriptive characters. It's these little touches that makes it worthwhile to hang on and endure this break from Egger's typical form. ...more Why can't I get into Dave Eggers? I tried to read a Heartbreaking Work of yada yada yada (but only found that frisbee scene with his little brother satisfying), tried to be amused by McSweeney's-related things, tried to listen to critiques who deem him a master craftsmen and the voice of a generation, but I just think that he doesn't deliver.

I do like his titles, and don't knock them as pretentious. How We Are Hungry is entertaining too in the same way that New Yorker fiction is entertaining, but I get the feeling Eggers-fanatics would claim he is far more relevant and poignant (read: he writes about arab nations) than those ambling New Yorker pieces. Maybe a little more clever, but I don't really buy the difference, and what's more, I'm not satisfied by either. I think I'm more ennamored of Eggers as a person (parents died, forced to look after younger brother, establishes McSweeneys, puts his ass/reputation on the line so virtually unknown writers can get their work out, generous soul) but as a writer he is light. I will say it now: Dave Eggers is like a female Gertrude Stein. ...more I really enjoyed this book, but I'm a huge Dave Eggers fan. I'd probably enjoy reading Dave Eggers's grocery list. That said, some of these stories probably aren't as well thought out as an Eggers's grocery list, as he alternates 'legitimate' short stories with one-to-two page 'stories' that are little more than second drafts of a writing exercise.

Eggers has his usual cutesy bits of pretension ('There are Some Things He Should Keep to Himself' for example is just blank pages), but I'll admit, I enjoy those types of things probably more than I should, even if they are a little too precious. In all, a must-read for hardcore Eggers fans, skip-able for most everyone else. ...more \u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc

changed my life Fiction Deflation. I wonder if I just don't get Dave Eggers. A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius is pretty much what the title suggests. One of the most unbelievable memoirs I've ever read. McSweeney's consistently puts out the most cutting edge mags and anthologies. They have the freshest ideas, synthesize combinations of avante-garde, interstitial, genre and academia.

But then Eggers writes fiction and I feel like I'm missing something. It reads at a very surface level. To me it reads like overly simplified Hemmingway. Nothing but facts. Right to the point. There is a suggestion of overarching metaphor, but it's just a suggestion. I read for metaphor. I am looking for spiritual, philosophical application in my life. Art peels masks. Takes the illusions in reality away by creating an obvious illusion. So when Eggers carts me through foreign lands, is he telling me I need to watch more CNN? Do I need to read the news more? I understand his books get nominated for plenty of awards and I'm a whore for that sort of thing, but I just don't get him. Velocity and Hologram were similar. Fact chasing around the world. He is a weird hero of mine. More for his philanthropic work and movement of modern literature, so why am I always at odds with his fiction? Does anyone else feel this way? It is inaccessible and surface level. The characters are only vaguely recognizable and because I love Eggers I blame myself. Perhaps I am not worldly enough to enter his characters and truly understand them? ...more I dunno, I just really really like Eggers and it's always been the case. 'How We are Hungry' sports a salmagundi of tales, ranging from the short-short (1 page) to the mini-epic (70 pages) and uniformly crowned with sensational titles: 'The Only Meaning of the Oil-Wet Water', 'Up the Mountain Coming Down Slowly', 'What it Means When a Crowd in a Faraway Nation Takes a Soldier Representing Your Own Nation, Shoots him, Drags Him from His Vehicle and Then Mutilates Him in the Dust.'

(That's a standalone story right there, no?) Too often maligned for his 'tweeness' or 'wankery of wordplay', I tend to think of him as more of a deeply felt and sincere human than I do of him a showpony or charlatan - it's just that he has a modern, Age-of-Twitter pithiness going on which some folk react to allergically, cynically, as though he were writing to score cheap sex or something (personally I think these folk need a fucking Valium, pronto). Certainly his recent projects ventriloquising the grave international stories of calamity-stricken others ('What is the What', 'Zeitoun') bespeak some sort of integrity (not to mention 849 Valencia St), and with his latest offering on order I look forward to seeing where his writerly evolution has taken his pure-form fiction ( 'A Hologram for the King' - dude can wrangle a title, or what!?). So, in summary: Fuck the haters, endorse the Eggers. You just know this guy is onto something secretive, peace-bearing, and real. ...more This is a mostly enjoyable collection of stores.

These are short stories and I appreciate the fact that they don't end with a bang - unlike Flannery O'Connor or someone where the characters putter along for a few dozen pages and you're not sure what it's leading to until someone unexpectedly gets decapitated. Eggers is a phenomenal writer. He can pack a vicious emotional kick into only a few pages. The stories were about rather mundane things, but that's where Eggers shows his excellence - he made me want to crawl into a hole and hide there in shame for the plainness and mediocrity of both humanity and myself. But in an eye-opening way. My favorite story was \"After I Was Thrown in the River and Before I Drowned\". Eggers is a beautiful writer and this particular story had me in tears - wonderful way to end the collection of short stories.<---C>Dave Eggers</---C>", "Title": "How We Are Hungry"},
