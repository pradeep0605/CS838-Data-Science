And as this world tightens its clutches around her, Stephanie starts to believe that though her Uncle\u2019s novels were horror, they were definitely not fiction. Lightened up by the funny and sarcastic lines from Skulduggery (like, \"For a guy with no internal organs, you've got quite the ego.\" \"And for a girl who can't stand up without falling over, you're quite the critic.\" \"My leg will be fine.\" \"And my ego will flourish. What a pair we are.\"), this is a book that really makes you consider that if these are the good guys, then how bad are the bad guys?!

You have to understand that, at this point, I wasn't a big reader. Yeah I didn't mind reading, but I also didn't love it. I didn't sit down for hours on end with a book in my hand.

You have to understand that, at this point, I wasn't a big reader. Yeah I didn't mind reading, but I also didn't love it. I didn't sit down for hours on end with a book in my hand. I didn't value the power of words as much as I do now. The closest I had gotten to realizing the magic of books was with Harry Potter , which was over at this stage and, unfortunately for me, it was spoiled by my asshole of a sister. I didn't read about Fred's death or about Snape's redemption or how the Dark Lord was slain; instead I was told it. And I was pretty heartbroken by it. Sure I will always criticize for the first books to be a bit too cheerful for my taste, but I was (and still am) in love from Goblet of Fire and onwards when the books grew darker. However despite my reluctance I took the book just to be nice. I don't know what made me crack open the book -- maybe my curiosity got the better of me, maybe the cool cover was what did it, maybe I asked myself \"Well what's the worse that can happen?\", or maybe my instincts told me to do it. Whatever the motivation I'm so glad I read that first sentence. I can't express to you in words how thankful I am that Emma gave me this very book. Because this book -- this series -- is the one. Although you might find it unbelievable, this is the book that made me become the bookworm that I am. It's because of this book that I want to be a writer. This series, however surprising it may seem to you, was the series I could go to whenever I felt scared or sad. I know people would think me silly that this series could mean something to anyone -- hell I'm not even sure <---A>Derek Landy</---A> understands himself. But it does to me. It means a lot . Because I can slip into this world and find comfort in the colourful and complex characters it contains. I can marvel at the magic, feel breathless at the action, laugh at all the delicious sarcasm, and feel sorrowful when things seem at their darkest. This series is my home. Although a few days ago I read the last page of the very last book with teary eyes, I will read this series again and again and again and I will always love what Derek Landy has created. And when people ask me when I'll finally be sick of this series, I will reply with; \"Until the end.\" Thank you Derek for writing such an unforgettable series that has shaped me into becoming who I am today. I will forever be grateful to you. ...more I loved discovering this book; I thought it had a very fun mixture of magic, action, creepiness, and humor--plus, I really love the title character :-) I have had the print book on my bookshelf for years, but I decided to try the audiobook from my library as this looked like it would be fun to listen to. Turns out I was right. This was a lot of fun. The narrator was great. He had a delicious Irish accent, although he modified it to suit other characters. I liked his sort of flat tone he used for Skulduggery, making him sound kind of ironic and mysterious, like there was a lot going on under the surface. At first, it's a bit odd.

This was a lot of fun. The narrator was great. He had a delicious Irish accent, although he modified it to suit other characters. I liked his sort of flat tone he used for Skulduggery, making him sound kind of ironic and mysterious, like there was a lot going on under the surface. At first, it's a bit odd. There's some weird music between interludes, followed by a low male voice saying, \"Yeah!\" I thought that was pretty weird and random, but it grew on me, fast. I had no expectations, so it was all novel for me. I expected the story to be campy, but it turns out to be pretty dark. Now the characters. Skulduggery is a fun and likable character. But he's also credibly tough. He's a sorcerer who happened to lose his body in an epic battle. I wondered how the author would get me to buy into a story where the main character is just a skeleton. It took about ten minutes. When I heard the explanation, I was like, \"Okay then.\" At some points, I'm skeptical that he's so blase about 12-year -old Stephanie going along with him on some very dangerous adventures. But I have to remind myself that the target audience is 12-year-olds. Skulduggery is a chill dude. It's funny how sanguine he is about Stephanie's bossing him around and threatening to hit him. Maybe he enjoys it because he's lonely. He was great friends with her uncle, so he might have developed a fondness for her via his friend. At any rate, he was very tolerant to Stephanie and he clearly took it very seriously to protect her, even if he did take her along on his dangerous missions. Knowing Stephanie, she probably would have followed him. Skulduggery is a good guy. You would think he'd be menacing, with the whole skeletal appearance, but he's an all around good guy, although he does have enough of a dark edge to be appealing and authentic. The interview with him at the end was awesome. Just the right touch for the audiobook. Stephanie is in some ways very much a girl of her age. Tween and teenage girls have attitude for days. Yes, it's a bit of a generalization, but there is a lot of truth in it. She also had a very vivid inner life that I recognized in myself. Not that I would have want to do every thing she does (okay, maybe some of it). She's pretty saucy, if I'm honest. It made me laugh and part of thought I'd get the taste slapped out of my mouth if I had talked to an adult that way when I was a kid. All in all, she's a well-drawn character, with the sass, bravery, sense of honor and a great sense of humor that should appeal to most readers. Together, they make quite a team. I enjoyed their buddy movie banter. Even if Stephanie could be kind of rude to Skulduggery. I loved it when he told her she was \"very annoying.\" The secondary characters are good, all making sense to the story. I liked the interactions between Stephanie and her clueless parents. They were cute. In a way, it was pretty obvious that Stephanie pretty much got away with a lot more than you'd expect for her age with them. I like that the tone of this book stays intense but with some good humor. I like that while Landry doesn't take himself too seriously, he shows respect for the intellect of his young readers. In other words, he doesn't make the story too silly or ridiculous. We are dealing with a very evil set of villains with uber-nefarious purposes. Some aspects were fairly creepy, and it reminded me a little of Simon R. Green's Nightside books in a good way. China Sorrow especially definitely made me think of a Nightside character. Don't get me wrong. I don't think this was derivative at all. It feels novel and unique amongst the many urban fantasy stories I've read or encountered. It has a lot of good action, and Skulduggery can fight, with his fists, with his trusty sidearm, and with his elemental magic. Speaking of, the magic elements were well done. They had a unique feel. I like the explanation about the different types of magic users. I think this series would make a fun movie. I'd be cool with either live action or animation. I definitely want to continue this series, and I am crossing my fingers that I can get the rest of these on audiobook. ...more I really tried to like this book. I really did. I failed. My major issue was that it was all 150% predictable . The story felt like I had read it all before: A little Harry Potter with a little Mission Impossible and a pinch of X-Men and a grain of blabla. The character writing was superficial and especially the heroine, Stephanie, did not convince me at all. Flat, unlikeable, unbelievable, one-dimensional. From one day to the next, she lives in a world she didn't know existed, and guess what? She I really tried to like this book. I really did. I failed.

From one day to the next, she lives in a world she didn't know existed, and guess what? She is just 12 years old, but scared of nothing. She escapes and survives every fight, no matter with who, with ease, and dominates Skulduggery, a 400 year old powerful detective, in just about every dialogue: \"Gordon was my friend. I thought I owed it to him to try and keep his favorite niece out of harm's way.\" \"Well, I'm in harms way, so it's not your decision any more.\" \"No, apparently it isn't.\" Descriptions of surroundings are minimalistic, The shop door was unlocked and he led the way in. Stephanie was surprised by how clean and bright and ordinary-looking it was. She didn't know what she was expecting - mannequins that came alive and tried to eat you, perhaps. There was a nice smell in here, too. Comforting. and I direly missed fresh ideas . Not recommended. ...more \u201cDoors are for people with no imagination.\u201d Initial Final Page Thoughts.

But it\u2019s totally fine, I mean\u2026 it\u2019s not as if I fancy dead guys all the time. What? I don\u2019t ..... BE QUIET. Angst Level. 4/10. Seeing as this is the first book of a series, it\u2019s difficult to really gage this level seeing as we don\u2019t really know much about the characters and their past just yet. Mr Landy does a great job of hinting to some really grim stuff, but not divulging any more than he needs to. Recommended For. People who are looking for a new magical series to get stuck into. People who wish their lover partner in crime was a skeleton with great fashion sense. People who prefer yellow cars to Bentleys. People who ever wonder what their reflection gets up to when their back is turned. People who still haven\u2019t forgiven their brother for buying them a dodgy copy of Grim Fandango for their twelfth birthday.

His characters are broadly drawn, meaty, yet precise - like Chinese calligraphy done with a big fat brush dripping with ink. The dialogue is snappy, with some fun deconstructionist bits; and the plot is just twisty enough: not even the very close listener Mr. Four could find any holes. But the real revelation here is Skulduggery Pleasant himself, a several-hundred-year-old living skeleton working as a freelance detective. He's urbane. He's competent. He's noble. He knows it. And his wit is very, very, very dry. He puts me in mind of James Bond, if Clive Owen had gotten the job. Or Indiana Jones, perhaps as played by Hugh Grant. It's fairly unusual in contemporary children's literature to find a leading man per se: that is, an adult male that carries the book. Adult males are villains (say, Voldemort), or guides (Dumbledore), or surrogate fathers who aren't around much either (Sirius Black), but it's usually the eleven-year-old orphan who is the center of attention. Skulduggery Pleasant is written from the point of view of its main female character, an eleven-year-old girl named Stephanie Edgely, but it's Skul who drives the action. He's more than a mere guide for Stephanie. It's interesting, and I think it's because Derek Landy's background is in screenwriting rather than children's literature. My guess is that nobody told him. Which is not to say that Stephanie falls by the wayside. More than your usual preternaturally resourceful girl protagonist, she is written from the inside out, and feels very real, though a bit devoid of background. Even her parents, bit players for sure, are people who you feel you kind of know. A word about the audio edition - GET THE AUDIO EDITION. Like the Lemony Snicket books read by Tim Curry, it has original music: deep, jazzy bass, thumps of percussion, fingersnaps and distant screams; and, also like those books, it is read by a MASTER of vocal characterization. Rupert Degas is apparently a voice superstar in the UK, with everything from Bob the Builder to Haruki Murakami on his resume, but this is the first time I've heard him. He reads an Irish tween girl as convincingly as an adult woman from London, and he has a vast repertoire of deep, hoarse, whispery, creaky, etc. that he gleefully applies to everyone else in the book. The cackling, gibbering, transforming Troll under Westminster Bridge should win this guy an Audie all by itself. We've played that chapter \"about a hundred and sixty-seven times, and it KEEPS GETTING FUNNIER EVERY SINGLE TIME\"! When we finished the audio book this afternoon, my two boys and I were left craving more Skulduggery, and there it was! a bonus track featuring an interview with the man himself: relaxed, egotistical, coy, and dead-on funny. Can't wait for the sequel. ...more [Note: from the charming Georgina's comments on this review, I've come to believe I am too far outside the age range.

WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE? Vivid characters. Likeable heroine. Beautiful writing. Action. Humour. Stephanie is a 12 years old girl with an attitude and an appetite for adventure. I\u2019ve connected with that little girl far more than with a majority of characters in books for which I\u2019m a target audience. She\u2019s interesting, curious, courageous, but at the same time not free of doubts or fears \u2013 she concurs them (unlike some characters that are TSTL apparently, and have a sensitivity of a brick. Is being born with no survival instinct a predisposition for becoming an awesome heroin that always triumphs? \u2013 Stephanie has a common sense!) What do we learn about her in the beginning? \u201cEver since she was a child, she had much preferred her own company to the company of others\u201d \u201cHer first year of secondary school had just come to a close, and she was looking forward to the summer break. She didn\u2019t like school. She found it difficult to get along with her classmates\u2014not because they weren\u2019t nice people, but simply because she had nothing in common with them. And she didn\u2019t like teachers. She didn\u2019t like the way they demanded respect they hadn\u2019t earned. Stephanie had no problem doing what she was told, just so long as she was given a good reason why she should.\u201d I liked her from the get go (probably because she resembles me quite a lot, or is it the other way around? Nvm). Isn\u2019t that logic brilliant! At that point she won me over. Then she meets a man. (*dramatic voice * a man with a plan \u2013 just kidding, no plan, but he\u2019s full of awesome). An interest sparks. \u201cStrong willed, intelligent, sharp-tongued, doesn\u2019t suffer fools gladly \u2026 remind you of anyone?\u201d \u201cYes. Gordon.\u201d \u201cInteresting,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause those are the exact words he used to describe you.\u201d She managed to have an attitude without acting cocky or obnoxious. Interactions between her and Skulduggery were hilarious. \u201cStephanie, I\u2019m not altogether sure you\u2019re respecting my authority.\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019m not.\u201d XD I loved her unflinching logic of a child \u201cHow can you talk? You move your mouth when you speak, but you\u2019ve got no tongue, you\u2019ve got no lips, you\u2019ve got no vocal cords. I mean, I know what skeletons look like \u2013 I\u2019ve seen diagrams and models and stuff \u2013 and the only thing that hold them together are flesh and skin and ligaments, so why don\u2019t you just fall apart? [...] And about, you know, nerve endings? Can you feel pain?[\u2026] Do you have a brain?\u201d Children have that amazing quality \u2013 they\u2019re curious and tend to question things. Lovely. I missed that, the consistent world I could immerse myself in. Crazy little cogs in the back of my mind are still doing a happy dance. Coherence bitches! You\u2019ve heard of it? All thanks to inquisitive questions of a 12 year old (well, I guess that speaks volumes about my mental development. I have a mindset of a primary school kid, apparently, for whenever I encounter discrepancies or chasms in the world building I seem to lose my collective shit.) Ergo, good for me Derek Landy did a wonderful job of developing a comprehensible and interesting world. I love Suldaggery (Isn\u2019t Skulduggery Pleasant the coolest name?) Mr. Pleasant, you\u2019re a skeleton.\u201d \u201c You know, I met your uncle under similar circumstances. Well, kind of similar. But he was drunk. And we were in a bar. And he had vomited on my shoes. So I suppose the actual circumstances aren\u2019t overly similar, but both events include a meeting, so \u2026 My point is, he was having some trouble and I was there to lend a hand, and we became good friends after that. Good, good friends.\u201d His head tilted. \u201cYou look like you might faint.\u201d Stephanie nodded slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve never fainted before, but I think you might be right.\u201d \u201cDo you want me to catch you if you fall, or \u2026 ?\u201d \u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d \u201cNo problem at all.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d Stephanie\u2019s thoughts are for the win. \u201cDo you know anything about engines?\u201d Stephanie asked. (her mother) \u201cThat\u2019s why I have a husband, so I don\u2019t have to. Engines and shelves, that\u2019s why men were invented.\u201d Stephanie made a mental note to learn about engines before she turned eighteen. She wasn\u2019t too fussed about the shelves.\u201d I LOVE her thought process! HOW ABOUT WRITING? Descriptions are eloquent, but Stephanie sounds and acts like a 12 year old girl. Landy managed to convey her age in speech patterns, that did wonders for the realism of characters. She\u2019s not a sudden superhero or a whiny annoying little girl. That is pretty hard to pull off, to find that balance. I loved the way she just rolled with the whole \u201cmeeting a skeleton\u201d situation (right after she got over the shock \u2013 and there was a minor shock, I tell you \u2013 see, makes sense!) The author conveys personalities of all characters with ease. There are fun bits of writing. One of the things I suspected would be interesting/hilarious were presumed problems with having a skeleton as a hero. Namely \u2013 face expressions. We can experience the delight of unconventional descriptive sentences like \u201cIf he\u2019d had eyebrows, they would most likely have been arched.\u201d or \u201dIf he\u2019d had eyelids, he might well be blinking.\u201d *chuckles* Little joys of life\u2026 Still not convinced the writing is nice? LEST! The author uses fucking \u201clest\u201d in that book. I can\u2019t even remember seeing it lately outside of English grammar lessons (Hmmm, and still the word order in sentences baffles me 0.o Meh.). She managed to keep her mother\u2019s attention off the house, lest she notice that the front door was merely leaning against the door frame. There, if you\u2019ve been reading a lot of badly written books, you might not even remember how it looks. Ok, at this point I\u2019m a little bit uninspired. (*gasp* what a shocking admission) I think I\u2019ll just stop now. The book was nice. I had fun. The whole thing unfolds and develops very nicely. Not too slow, not too fast. At no point are we force-fed the \u2018nausea inducing enormous world building information set\u2019 (shit! WTF? Ok, my grammar took a day of. I have no idea what a correct word order would be in this sentence. Please accept my deepest apologies.) Heh, fine, just\u2026 THE END. There. It almost doesn\u2019t look as if a rabid dog chewed off an eloquent conclusion. ( Smooth Anna, very smooth *pats myself on the back* ) *In my defence I plan to come back to this review once my cerebral hemispheres stop sulking and start communicating once again. EDIT: It's a solid piece of writing with filled with nice, well developed characters, a lot of action, funny dialogues, descriptive language, consistent world-building and cookies (view spoiler) [ no, not cookies, but wouldn't that be great?

I look at you and...\" \"And you're reminded of yourself when you were my age?\" \"Hmm? Oh, no, what I was going to say is there's something about you that is really annoying, and you never do what your'e told, and sometimes I question your intelligence, but even so I'm going to train you, because I like having someone follow me around like a little puppy. It makes me feel good about myself.\" NO JOKE. I TALK LIKE SKULDUGGERY. Which makes me feel grand kinship to this skeleton of awesome. I was a little disappointed it wasn't solely focused on solving mysteries though. I had it in my head that it was a skeletonal Sherlock Holmes. It's not. It's more magicy and dangerous and Grand Evil Plots That Must Be Stopped. That's not bad or anything, just wasn't what I was expecting. (Although I did get confused sometimes...but possibly I was reading too fast.) And it DID have a lot of the ol' cliches. Like Stephanie is 12 and, you know, parents are a problem. And somehow her missing school was not an issue. BUT HEY. I think it was written before those cliches were labelled specific cliches. So I'll forgive it. I did like Stephanie, how stubborn yet nice she was. Respectfully stubborn. THAT is the way it should be. For the wit, I want to give it all the stars. But in truth, I was a bit detached while reading it. Just not fully invested. I'LL READ MORE, THOUGH. And, between doing so, I will comfort myself in the fact that I, too, make jokes like an epic Skeleton. \"If you here any screaming,\" [Skulduggery] said, \"that'll be me.\" ...more Interesting odd little book, a dead wizard...sort of.

I really loved the whole experience of this book. The story is excellent, and the narrator is outstanding, bringing this to a solid five stars from me. This is the story of twelve-year-old Stephanie, who inherits her beloved but somewhat mysterious author uncle's fortune and estate after his sudden death. The unusual stranger at the reading of the will catches her eye--his voice, his mannerisms, his name (who is named Skulduggery Pleasant, after all!?), all so strange yet so interesting--not to mention his odd appearance muffled nearly head to foot in coat, hat and scarf even in doors! Soon, strange things begin to happen. Stephanie's life is in danger and it seems that Skulduggery Pleasant is just the person to save her... trouble is, he also leads her into a dangerous new world of magic and criminals, a world Stephanie feels drawn to, feels is so much more vibrant than her own. When they begin to realize that the world itself is threatened by some evil wizards, Stephanie and Skulduggery team up with a few other brave souls to help restore balance. I really loved the characters, the pacing, the action and the overall atmosphere and \"feel\" of the book. I guess I'm a fan of stories with living skeletons--I loved \"He-Man\" as a kid, though fortunately Skulduggery is a much more complex, interesting character than Skeletor was ;-p Stephanie is a thoughtful and complex character herself while still seeming true to her young age. The supporting cast of characters is also solid. I especially liked Stephanie's parents (so nice to see a happy home life portrayed, with mutual respect between parents and child) and loved-to-hate Stephanie's awful relatives! It was great how the plot twists kept me guessing, not only on the action but also on the \"good\"/\"bad\" of each character. While the Irish setting isn't too prominent, I did enjoy some of the little tidbits that reminded me this was set on the Emerald Isle, and I especially loved the Irish accent of the audiobook narrator. Speaking of which, I highly recommend listening to the audiobook. The story itself reads a bit like an old action-adventure film noir (but with much more complex characters and more lighthearted) and this is enhanced by the narration as well as the little musical interludes between the chapters (one can almost picture a skeleton jazz band playing!) accompanied by little \"horror\" sound-effects like a woman screaming or heavy footsteps walking away. I definitely plan to continue the series. My husband is two books ahead of me and says that the next two books are also excellent. Highly recommended. It's a fun, slightly spooky book, with a surprising amount of depth and it's just so well written and witty and engaging. There are a few \"scary\" and slightly gory parts so I would recommend this for the older middle grade set and above, but I have a pretty low threshold for that sort of thing and I was able to handle it. ...more \"There's no such thing as winning or losing.

There is so much that I love about this book that I'm not sure where to start. I guess I could try with how enjoyable and fast-paced the story is. Even though there's not much world-building, in no way was I ever confused about the characters and their situation. This much is really all you need to know: bad guy wants the Sceptor to summon back the Ancients, which are gods to the sorcerers, and if that were to happen, it would be bad. Very bad. And who is there to stop him? A walking, talking, fire-wielding skeleton detective, a 12-year-old girl, and some other members of the Addams Family. And it's awesome. The relationship between Skulduggery Pleasant and Stephanie reminds me a lot of the one between the Doctor and his companion. Their adventures, the way they banter, and how easy they communicate with each other makes the dialogue and action scenes extremely fun to read. I thought a 12-year-old as a protagonist might make this book seem extremely juvenile, but even though Stephanie is young, she still makes herself useful in a tricky situation, and her character doesn't seem unrealistic for someone her age. And Skulduggery... oh, if only you weren't dead. Our love would be perfect. Serpine stood, walked behind his captive. \"Somehow I don't think they would be able to marshal their forces so quickly. Or so effectively. No, my old enemy, I think for the moment, anyway, we're all alone. And you have something I want.\" \"A winning sense of style?\" If you are to read this book for anything, read it for him. The man will make you smile, and perhaps look at this book funny, but then again, he is quite the peculiar character. He's a living skeleton, for Pete's sake. \"You don't think it sounds silly, do you?\" \"On the contrary, I think it sounds perfect. Valkyrie. Warrior women who guide the souls of the dead off the battlefield. A tad morbid, but then, who am I to judge? I'm technically dead.\" Okay, not so living. Still, despite the humor and lightness of this book, there is a serious undertone that I quite like as well. Skulduggery Pleasant manages to be a blast without appearing too silly for the reader to engage in it. The action scenes are really thorough and there are some deep emotions that run throughout, especially where Skulduggery is concerned. There is such a nice blend of action, magic, and damn good storytelling going on here. These pages fell through my hands to get to the end. I also grew quite attached to Skulduggery, but c'mon--I doubt many people would mind him hanging around. ...more I loved this book! I found it listed on one of Goodreads' best audiobooks lists, and boy were they right. I'm sure I would have enjoyed the story in print as well. It's the kind of story I like, with a plucky but slightly snarky kid and a cool magical mystery. And Skulduggery just takes it over the top with his cool lines and risky moves. But listening to the book as read by the incredible Rupert Degas made it extraordinary. He made every character feel totally real. Skulduggery is cool, funny a I loved this book!

But listening to the book as read by the incredible Rupert Degas made it extraordinary. He made every character feel totally real. Skulduggery is cool, funny and sly. Stephanie is eager and brave, but still funny and real. The scary parts of the story were infinitely more scary when listening than they would have been on paper and the humor was significantly more funny. Lines that might have earned a chuckle or a gasp got huge laughs or anxious total attention when read by Degas in his expressive tones. Plus the production put in music at the end of the chapters that really helped set the tone. The occasional cliffhanger line coinciding with a scream and a spooky door creak was just great. It felt a lot like listening to one of the great old radio show productions; it really felt like it was meant to be performed. It was so good that when I found out that the 2nd and 3rd books were only available as audiobooks from Audible (instead of from the library where I got this one) I actually joined Audible just so I could get these books. And I'm cheap! Adults and kids will all love these books. And if you have a family vacation coming up, listening to this book in the car will make a long trip just breeze on by. ...more This was a perfect book for kids and not just. I loved every minute of it. Witty and hilarious and so much fun to read. There were more witty repartees in this book alone than in the sum total of my last 10 reads. Rupert Degas did a wonderful job as a narrator. He managed to convey the author's sense of humour with great skill. Then this guy is not bored by the book he's narrating, he does wonders! SO GOOD.

I will freely admit that a good part of the consideration of this 4-star rating is that I'm really enamored with the whole idea and premise of the thing - the animated skeleton, who's also a wizard, and a detective? It's like Harry Dresden and Bob all rolled into one snarky, crime-fighting, bad-guy-stopping-pacakge. So, if the execution faltered here and there - the idea is just too cool.

Another part of the 4-star rating is that I like the characters. I like Skulduggery and Stephanie, and I can see how she has great potential to grow as a character. Tanith Low is really cool, too - a nice mix of age and ability, with a sometimes youthful openness. And Mr. Bliss and Ghastly are interesting additions. Where the story is strongest is in the character interactions - their banter and the wit and humor peppered through-out made it enjoyable. That said - I had trouble following the action sequences. And there's a lot of action. (One of the blurbs for the book says it's movie ready, and I agree, but I don't necessarily see this as a good thing - because I'd like, at times, a bit more depth.) But I couldn't always quite get a handle and \"see\" what was going on in my head. The action is also a bit repetitive - they sneak about, get found, fight it out, get overwhelmed, run away... only to repeat the pattern again. And again. Also, the plot is pretty standard good vs. evil kind of stuff - complete with hokey villian and annoyingly incompetent good guy council, whom the rouge, and mistrusted agent, must work around to defeat the bad guy. I think, for the target age group, they'll be so caught up in the characters, the banter, and the downright cool magic tidbits unique to this world (like the reflection thing), and they won't care a wit if the villian's cartoony. But, for me, while I still enjoyed it, it was weak in places. That said - I'm still itching to get my hands on the next in the series. I hope that the pros stay strong, and the weaknesses get fleshed out a bit more, because this has the potential to be a really good, and really fun series. p.s. There's a short story at the end, in the Extras section, which is really good and funny, and which gives me a lot of hope for the possible future of the series. ...more Skeleton Rolls with wit and fun Little girl joins to make a run, Together they succeed and together they fail Others make attempts strong or frail! Clues come along and actions done Skulduggery Pleasant is fun fun and fun. Oh dear Skulduggery, how Pleasant have you made me!! There are stories that make you think and then there are stories that make you happy. Surly this book falls in the second kind. I was happy more than I was thoughtful, and in this cruel world that's an achievement indeed.

There are stories that make you think and then there are stories that make you happy. Surly this book falls in the second kind. I was happy more than I was thoughtful, and in this cruel world that's an achievement indeed. This story starts like many others with a few common formulas. At the beginning I was like ... Meh! I know the things well enough! ... but as it progressed I fell in love and more love with each chapters. There are heroes, villains, great side characters, passerby characters, inactive characters, harmless characters, harmful characters and there is death, life, success, hope and hopelessness. Common theories like Names have power... Hero with a sidekick formula... ultimate evil guy trying to destroy the world... had not bothered much because of the witty dialogs and fast paced storyline. And new ideas were introduced along the line smoothly. Things never became boring and the progress of Stephine is quite appreciable. I have only one complain about the series and that is the magic. While many ideas about the magic ( ...like Book of Names, or The Mirror Magic ) was ingenious, magic done by Skulduggery wasn't impressive at all. But I forgive him since he is quite entraining in his own way. Every good point comes back to dialogs, doesn't it? If you read you will understand. Don't just take it from me. Also, the story started at a slow pace and by the end you will see it mature to such of any series ending book. Because the threat becomes bigger to biggest by then! I mean there is enough element which people can easily stretch and make a trilogy! But not Derek Landy .... he finished it within a few above 300 pages. I thank him for that. And just like that Derek Landy became one of my favorite writers. I will definitely read more of him, soon. :) ...more", "Title": "Skulduggery Pleasant"},
