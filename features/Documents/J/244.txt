Excellent premise, and one I had not personally ever come across. <---A>Joseph Sweet</---A> needs to be a household name. Seriously. ...more YES!! This is the zombie book I was looking for! Man, there's a lot of crap horror out there. I've been weeding through trying to find something that fills my desire to watch zombie movies and The Walking Dead but in book form. This did it, to a T. I'd call this \"smart horror\", if such thing exists. The plot is no more believable than any other zombie story, BUT it's well-written and takes zombies to a whole new level with a as-plausable-as-zombie-stories-can-be plot line.

I can't wait for the next book in the series! ...more Really liked it! Love the \"new\" zombies! Of course I am left waiting anxiously for the next book.... Hooked, need more :) Requiem for Humanity By Joseph Sweet Such a good book. This was the second book I had read of Mr. Sweet. The first being a novella The Drawer which I will be posting a review shortly. Requiem was a unique take in this genre. The common thread through the many groups of survivors had written down the events that had pertained to their group, observations and surviving. Some even left warnings for other survivors of things they had witnessed first hand and discoveries made along the way to survival Requiem for Humanity By Joseph Sweet Such a good book. This was the second book I had read of Mr. Sweet. The first being a novella The Drawer which I will be posting a review shortly. Requiem was a unique take in this genre. The common thread through the many groups of survivors had written down the events that had pertained to their group, observations and surviving. Some even left warnings for other survivors of things they had witnessed first hand and discoveries made along the way to survival. It all started with a group finding a journal of a survivor's account and timeline of events as she witnessed them. The finder of the journal thought that it was a good idea to continue on. They would write the account of what had become of their lives in the group they were in. None of these various groups knew if there were other survivors out there after years of the undead walking the earth, but when they were done they would each leave the journal in a public place along with other survivor's journals they found, in hopes that the discoveries made would help others to survive . Up till the Zombie apocalypse happened most only knew what they had read in books or seen in the movies. If that were that lucky to have been a consumer of zombie fiction at all. Two years after the outbreak the Zombies were not what they once were slow, brain dead and hungry . They are now cunning, resourceful and able to use tools. It appears the smart zombies started from a failed attempt by the C.E.L.L to find a cure and the experiments they were doing on any Survivors they came across. Penelope was saved from the C.E.L.L.'s men who were mistaken for the Military. by Ed or if you want the full name, Eduardo Enrique Luiz. However, things changed from that point on for both Penelope & Ed as well as for Zombie kind. Pick up this book,<---M> you won't be sorry</---M>, there is a second book in this series out now also you'll want to read as well. Mr. Sweet did a great job creating a world with well-rounded characters with depth. I look forward to reading more by this Author. ...more Requires for humanity Very interesting read,ran through it in one evening.
