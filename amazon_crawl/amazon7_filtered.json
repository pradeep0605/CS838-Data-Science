As attention-grabbing in its design as it is in its content, this bold volume outlines the laws of power in their unvarnished essence, synthesizing the philosophies of Machiavelli, Sun-tzu, Carl von Clausewitz, and other great thinkers. Some laws require prudence (\"Law 1: Never Outshine the Master\"), some stealth (\"Law 3: Conceal Your Intentions\"), and some the total absence of mercy (\"Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally\") but like it or not, all have applications in real-life situations. Illustrated through the tactics of Queen Elizabeth I, Henry Kissinger, P. T. Barnum, and other famous figures who have wielded -- or been victimized by -- power, these laws will fascinate any reader interested in gaining, observing, or defending against ultimate control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "There's a problem loading this menu right now.", "Learn more about Amazon Prime."], "Reviews": "2,151", "Average_Rating": "4.6 out of 5 stars", "ProductDetails": ["Paperback:", "452 pages", "Publisher:", "Penguin Books; 1st edition (September 1, 2000)", "Language:", "English", "ISBN-10:", "0140280197", "ISBN-13:", "978-0140280197", "Product Dimensions:", "6.5 x 1.3 x 9.1 inches", "Shipping Weight:", "1.6 pounds (", "View shipping rates and policies", ")", "Average Customer Review:"]},

", "America's national parks are full of timeless marvels that still rejuvenate the soul: the world's largest trees in Sequoia; its most spectacular geothermal site in Yellowstone; the grandest canyon. Perhaps the movement's most eloquent description that is still resonates came from national parks advocate John Muir: 'Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home; that wildness is a necessity...' Fortunately for the nerve-shaken, over-civilized people of then and now, President Woodrow Wilson created the National Parks Service (NPS) on August 25, 1916, though the drive to protect some of America's most remarkable wild spaces, to be 'used and preserved for the benefit of mankind', began in the 1860s. ", "From Acadia to Zion, this beautiful introduction to America's preserved natural treasures is packed with landscape photography, original wildlife illustrations, and practical information. You will surely be inspired to rediscover these incredible spaces and find out why they're worth celebrating and you'll have all the tools to plan the first of many exciting trips. ", "This book is intended to be a practical introduction to each of America's 59 national parks, distilled by Lonely Planet's expert authors. We highlight the best activities and trails, explain how to get there and where to stay, show you the wildlife to watch out for, and suggest ideal itineraries. Whether you're lucky enough to have a park on your doorstep or need to travel further, we hope that the following pages inspire you both the iconic and lesser-known gems that make up the USA's diversely breathtaking expanses.

I first became interested in the science of habits eight years ago, as a newspaper reporter in Baghdad, when I heard about an army major conducting an experiment in a small town named Kufa. The major had analyzed videotapes of riots and had found that violence was often preceded by a crowd of Iraqis gathering in a plaza and, over the course of hours, growing in size. Food vendors would show up, as well as spectators. Then, someone would throw a rock or a bottle.", "When the major met with Kufa\u2019s mayor, he made an odd request: Could they keep food vendors out of the plazas? Sure, the mayor said. A few weeks later, a small crowd gathered near the Great Mosque of Kufa. It grew in size. Some people started chanting angry slogans. At dusk, the crowd started getting restless and hungry. People looked for the kebab sellers normally filling the plaza, but there were none to be found. The spectators left. The chanters became dispirited. By 8 p.m., everyone was gone.", "I asked the major how he had figured out that removing food vendors would change peoples' behavior.", "The U.S. military, he told me, is one of the biggest habit-formation experiments in history. \u201cUnderstanding habits is the most important thing I\u2019ve learned in the army,\u201d he said. By the time I got back to the U.S., I was hooked on the topic.", "Q. How have your own habits changed as a result of writing this book?", "A. Since starting work on this book, I've lost about 30 pounds, I run every other morning (I'm training for the NY Marathon later this year), and I'm much more productive. And the reason why is because I've learned to diagnose my habits, and how to change them.", "Take, for instance, a bad habit I had of eating a cookie every afternoon. By learning how to analyze my habit, I figured out that the reason I walked to the cafeteria each day wasn't because I was craving a chocolate chip cookie. It was because I was craving socialization, the company of talking to my colleagues while munching. That was the habit's real reward. And the cue for my behavior - the trigger that caused me to automatically stand up and wander to the cafeteria, was a certain time of day.", "So, I reconstructed the habit: now, at about 3:30 each day, I absentmindedly stand up from my desk, look around for someone to talk with, and then gossip for about 10 minutes. I don't even think about it at this point. It's automatic. It's a habit. I haven't had a cookie in six months.", "Q. What was the most surprising use of habits that you uncovered?", "A. The most surprising thing I've learned is how companies use the science of habit formation to study - and influence - what we buy.", "Take, for example, Target, the giant retailer. Target collects all kinds of data on every shopper it can, including whether you\u2019re married and have kids, which part of town you live in, how much money you earn, if you've moved recently, the websites you visit. And with that information, it tries to diagnose each consumer\u2019s unique, individual habits.", "Why? Because Target knows that there are these certain moments when our habits become flexible. When we buy a new house, for instance, or get married or have a baby, our shopping habits are in flux. A well-timed coupon or advertisement can convince us to buy in a whole new way. But figuring out when someone is buying a house or getting married or having a baby is tough. And if you send the advertisement after the wedding or the baby arrives, it\u2019s usually too late.", "So Target studies our habits to see if they can predict major life events. And the company is very, very successful. Oftentimes, they know what is going on in someone's life better than that person's parents.", "NEW YORK TIMES ", "BESTSELLER \u2022 NPR", " ", "BESTSELLER \u2022 ", "WASHINGTON POST ", "BESTSELLER \u2022 ", "LOS ANGELES TIMES ", "BESTSELLER \u2022 ", "USA TODAY ", "BESTSELLER \u2022 ", "PUBLISHERS WEEKLY ", "BESTSELLER", "\u201cSharp, provocative, and useful.\u201d", "\u2014Jim Collins", " \u00a0", " \u201cFew [books] become essential manuals for business and living.

Psychologists and inspirational speakers Cloud and Townsend show readers how to set reasonable boundaries in order to follow the true path of Christianity. This book has become immensely popular, most likely because it makes personal boundaries easier to define and is filled with spiritual purpose. Some cautions: the format can be overly self-helpish for such a complex discussion and the authors at one point imply that judicious spankings may be an acceptable form of setting boundaries with children.

To kick resistance, Pressfield stresses loving what one does, having patience and acting in the face of fear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t--This text refers to the ", "Kindle Edition", " edition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "Drawing on his many years' experience as a writer, Pressfield  (The Legend of Bagger Vance) presents his first nonfiction work,  which aims to inspire other writers, artists, musicians, or  anyone else attempting to channel his or her creative energies.  The focus is on combating resistance and living the destiny that  Pressfield believes is gifted to each person by an all-powerful  deity. While certainly of great value to frustrated writers  struggling with writer's block, Pressfield's highly personal  philosophy, soundly rooted in his own significant life  challenges, has merit for anyone frustrated in fulfilling his or  her life purpose.  Successful photographer Ulrich (photography chair, Art Inst. of  Boston; coeditor, The Visualization Manual) explores the  creative impulse and presents an approach to developing  creativity that, like Pressfield's, will be relevant to artists  and others. He identifies and explains seven distinct stages of  the creative process: discovery and encounter, passion and  commitment, crisis and creative frustration, retreat and  withdrawal, epiphany and insight, discipline and completion, and  responsibility and release. He also develops his view of the  three principles of the creative impulse, which include creative  courage, being in the right place at the right time, and  deepening connections with others. Rooted in Eastern philosophy,  Ulrich's fully developed treatise nicely updates the solid works  of Brewster Ghiselin (The Creative Process), Rollo May (The  Courage To Create), and Julia Cameron (The Artist's Way). It  also supplements Pressfield's inspirational thoughts on  overcoming resistance through introspective questions and  practical exercises that further elaborate the creative process.  Both books are recommended for public libraries needing  additional works on creativity.

Each guidepost is the focus of a chapter that contains illustrative stories, primarily from her own life; definitions, including the difference between shame and guilt; quotes from such diverse sources as Diane Ackerman and E.E. Cummings; and brief suggestions of activities that she pursues with the assumption that they might help her audience. Although these activities are highlighted in her introduction to the book, they are in short supply and the book functions more as a chatty meditation on the guideposts. Despite occasional moments of insight, this book's primary value may be in spurring thought and providing references to other authors that will provide further inspiration for those seeking a more meaningful life.

In this latest book, she emphasizes that above all other ingredients of living an emotionally healthy life is the importance of loving ourselves. In the grips of what she took to be a breakdown, or midlife crisis, Brown came to understand she was experiencing a \u201cspiritual awakening\u201d and worked to explore its significance and the interaction of knowing and understanding yourself and loving yourself. She intersperses her own personal journey with research and clinical observations of others of the work of living a \u201cwholehearted\u201d life, or \u201cengaging in our lives from a place of worthiness.\u201d The point is to embrace life and oneself with all the imperfections, releasing the stress of overdoing and overworking. Brown offers exercises for readers to plumb their own emotions and begin to develop the kind of resilience needed to stand up to unrealistic expectations of others and ourselves. --Vanessa Bush\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "There's a problem loading this menu right now.", "Learn more about Amazon Prime."], "Reviews": "3,249", "Average_Rating": "4.6 out of 5 stars", "ProductDetails": ["Paperback:", "160 pages", "Publisher:", "Hazelden Publishing; 1 edition (August 27, 2010)", "Language:", "English", "ISBN-10:", "159285849X", "ISBN-13:", "978-1592858491", "Product Dimensions:", "6 x 0.4 x 9 inches", "Shipping Weight:", "8.5 ounces (", "View shipping rates and policies", ")", "Average Customer Review:"]},

It turns out, however, that a set of attitudes needn't be so set, according to Dweck, professor of psychology at Stanford. Dweck proposes that everyone has either a fixed mindset or a growth mindset. A fixed mindset is one in which you view your talents and abilities as... well, fixed. In other words, you are who you are, your intelligence and talents are fixed, and your fate is to go through life avoiding challenge and failure. A growth mindset, on the other hand, is one in which you see yourself as fluid, a work in progress. Your fate is one of growth and opportunity. Which mindset do you possess? Dweck provides a checklist to assess yourself and shows how a particular mindset can affect all areas of your life, from business to sports and love. The good news, says Dweck, is that mindsets are not set: at any time, you can learn to use a growth mindset to achieve success and happiness. This is a serious, practical book. Dweck's overall assertion that rigid thinking benefits no one, least of all yourself, and that a change of mind is always possible, is welcome.

Now 40, he has built, among other projects, and owns outright, Fifth Avenue's retail and residential Trump Tower (where he occupies a double-triplex suite); owns and operates Trump's Castle, a casino in Atlantic City; is arguably the most visible young man on Manhattan's celebrity circuit (\"Governor Cuomo calls. . . . dinner at St. Patrick's Cathedral. . . .

", " ", "\"A New Look at Cuba\" by Rachel Lee Harris You ve booked a flight from Miami and have your approved travel visa in hand. You re ready to see Cuba. Now what? Cue Stephan VanDam, a cartographer, graphic designer and president of the map company that bears his name. Though practical, his witty, origami-like physical maps and sleek 4-D interactive digital maps can also carve a historic or cultural path through a city (like his History Mapped presidential series). The company has now turned its attention to Cuba. Using his signature StreetSmart series design for printed maps (Internet connections are still scant in Cuba), Mr. VanDam points out Havana s restaurants, hotels, resorts and the home-based restaurants known as paladares and offers five self-guided tours that wind through the city s many plazas to contemporary galleries, music venues and gardens, along the Malec\u00f3n coastal road and as far as the beaches of Playas de Este. As an amateur mambo dancer and Latin Jazz aficionado, Mr. VanDam has always had a fascination with Cuba and its connection to the Latin jazz scene in New York, he said on the phone from his office there. Musically, it's a world power. I remember my parents doing the mambo in the 1950s and their parents in the 30s. So the maps focus a lot on those aspects of Cuba s culture. It s also a treasure trove of architecture, he said. Cuba is totally cohesive in its urban fabric since there was no money after the revolution to replace buildings with modern structures. The company also has produced StreetSmart Cuba, which maps out the network of Spanish Colonial towns and Unesco World Heritage sites on country roads from west to east, and guides travelers through beach towns along the shores both north and south. The Havana map is $8.95, the Cuba map $9.95 --The New York Times, Travel", "\"In Cuba, Maps Make a Comeback\" by Steve Heller Old-fashioned navigation is enjoying a renaissance on the island, where Internet access is still scant. When Stephan Van Dam began designing two detailed tourist maps of Cuba in 2014, he couldn t have known that one year later, the prospect of renewed relations between the country and the U.S. could effectively create a whole new market for them. At the time Van Dam, the founder of VanDam s StreetSmart maps, was catering to a smaller audience: the Americans who could only visit the country if they were Cuban-American or embarking on a people-to-people tour run by a licensed guide, and the 1.1 million Canadians and hundreds of thousands of European travelers who visited last year. In 2015, the country offers jaded American travelers something different from the usual tourist trappings. According to Van Dam, the country is experiencing a brief moment free of advertising before global corporate luxe flattens the island. With highly legible cartography and engaging photographic covers, his StreetSmart Cuba and StreetSmart Havana maps highlight local business colorfully. They're guides to the latest hotels, resorts, restaurants and paladares (private family-run restaurants) that appeal to the pioneering tourist eager to experience the country before the inevitable onslaught of development. Van Dam s Cuban maps culled their information from both federal data and his team s personal experience. The relief and terrain data come courtesy of the CIA; the cultural and urban information was provided by Havana s Office of the City Historian; the restaurant and paladares recommendations from his team s ground trothing and testing, as well as recommendations by Cubans and American friends. Walking Havana from one end to the other gave Van Dam a sense of the urban fabric, which is, by his description, frozen in time and brimming with period-specific architectural jewels buildings that reflect Plateresque, Cuban baroque, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Streamline Moderne, Mid-century modern, and Soviet Brutalist architectures. Cuba, he says, \"avoided the 1960s Corbusian redevelopment schemes that destroyed so many world cities throughout the Americas.\" To develop the maps, Van Dam and his team visited Cuba in 2013 under a U.S. self-certification program administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control that permits U.S. citizens to travel to Cuba independently to conduct research. With the prospect of sanctions being lifted in the near future, Van Dam is already planning more Cuba projects across new media, starting with a website mapping the influence of the clave, an instrument that figures widely in Cuban music, around the world. The paper map may be old-fashioned, but when it comes to Cuba, Van Dam is ahead of the curve. Havana is currently a dark spot on Google Street Maps, and Google hasn't yet released a statement saying when the company will upgrade its coverage. Even if Street Maps did work there, though, there are no guarantees it would have very many users in the near future. With Internet coverage at a scant 5 percent across the country and download speeds reminiscent of the pre-dial-up era, Cuba doesn t yet have the digital infrastructure to support cell phone cartography. Which leaves room for a handy paper copy renaissance: This is a fleeting moment, Van Damm notes, when the trusty laminated map trumps Google views. --The Atlantic Magazine", "Top 10 what to take to Cuba 1_USB Flash Drives 2_Kleenex 3_VanDam Havana StreetSmart Maps.

Here he examines and challenges our concepts of \u201cadvantage\u201d and \u201cdisadvantage\u201d in a way that may seem intuitive to some and surprising to others. Beginning with the classic tale of David and Goliath and moving through history with figures such as Lawrence of Arabia and Martin Luther King Jr., Gladwell shows how, time and again, players labeled \u201cunderdog\u201d use that status to their advantage and prevail through the elements of cunning and surprise. He also shows how certain academic \u201cadvantages,\u201d such as getting into an Ivy League school, have downsides, in that being a \u201cbig fish in a small pond\u201d at a less prestigious school can lead to greater confidence and a better chance of success in later life. Gladwell even promotes the idea of a \u201cdesirable difficulty,\u201d such as dyslexia, a learning disability that causes much frustration for reading students but, at the same time, may force them to develop better listening and creative problem-solving skills. As usual, Gladwell presents his research in a fresh and easy-to-understand context, and he may have coined the catchphrase of the decade, \u201cUse what you got.\u201d --David Siegfried\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t--This text refers to the ", "Hardcover", " edition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "\"Truly intriguing and inspiring.\"\u2015", "Hector Tobar", ", ", "Los Angeles Times", "\"Provocative....", "David and Goliath ", "is a lean, consuming read.\"\u2015", "John Wilwol", ", ", "San Francisco Chronicle ", "\"As always, Gladwell's sweep is breathtaking and thought-provoking.\"\u2015", "Joe Nocera", ", ", "New York Times", "\"Fascinating....Gladwell is a master of synthesis.

Written in 1946, Camus's compelling and troubling tale of a disaffected, apparently amoral young man has earned a durable popularity (and remains a staple of U.S. high school literature courses) in part because it reveals so vividly the anxieties of its time. Alienation, the fear of anonymity, spiritual doubt--all could have been given a purely modern inflection in the hands of a lesser talent than Camus, who won the Nobel Prize in 1957 and was noted for his existentialist aesthetic. The remarkable trick of ", "The Stranger", ", however, is that it's not mired in period philosophy.", "  The plot is simple. A young Algerian, Meursault, afflicted with a sort of aimless inertia, becomes embroiled in the petty intrigues of a local pimp and, somewhat inexplicably, ends up killing a man. Once he's imprisoned and eventually brought to trial, his crime, it becomes apparent, is not so much  the arguably defensible murder he has committed as it is his deficient  character. The trial's proceedings are absurd, a parsing of  incidental trivialities--that Meursault, for instance, seemed unmoved by his own  mother's death and then attended a comic movie the evening after her funeral are two ostensibly damning facts--so that the eventual sentence the jury issues is both ridiculous and inevitable.", "  Meursault remains a cipher nearly to the story's end--dispassionate,  clinical, disengaged from his own emotions. \"She wanted to know if I loved her,\" he says of his girlfriend. \"I answered the same way I had the last time, that it didn't mean anything but that I probably didn't.\" There's a latent ominousness in such observations, a sense that devotion is nothing more than self-delusion. It's undoubtedly true that Meursault exhibits an extreme of resignation; however, his confrontation with \"the gentle indifference of the world\" remains as compelling as it was when Camus first recounted it. ", "--Ben Guterson", "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "The new translation of Camus's classic is a cultural event; the translation of Cocteau's diary is a literary event. Both translations are superb, but Ward's will affect a naturalized narrative, while Browner's will strengthen Cocteau's reemerging critical standing. Since 1946 untold thousands of American students have read a broadly interpretative, albeit beautifully crafted British Stranger . Such readers have closed Part I on \"door of undoing\" and Part II on \"howls of execration.\" Now with the domestications pruned away from the text, students will be as close to the original as another language will allow: \"door of unhappiness\" and \"cries of hate.\" Browner has no need to \"write-over\" another translation. With Cocteau's reputation chiefly as a cineaste until recently, he has been read in French or not at all. Further, the essay puts a translator under less pressure to normalize for readers' expectations. Both translations show the current trend to stay closer to the original.

", " ", "In this apologia for Christian faith, Keller mines material from literary classics, philosophy, anthropology and a multitude of other disciplines to make an intellectually compelling case for God. Written for skeptics and the believers who love them, the book draws on the author's encounters as founding pastor of New York's booming Redeemer Presbyterian Church. One of Keller's most provocative arguments is that all doubts, however skeptical and cynical they may seem, are really a set of alternate beliefs. Drawing on sources as diverse as 19th-century author Robert Louis Stevenson and contemporary New Testament theologian N.T. Wright, Keller attempts to deconstruct everyone he finds in his way, from the evolutionary psychologist Richard Dawkins to popular author Dan Brown. The first, shorter part of the book looks at popular arguments against God's existence, while the second builds on general arguments for God to culminate in a sharp focus on the redemptive work of God in Christ. Keller's condensed summaries of arguments for and against theism make the scope of the book overwhelming at times. Nonetheless, it should serve both as testimony to the author's encyclopedic learning and as a compelling overview of the current debate on faith for those who doubt and for those who want to re-evaluate what they believe, and why.

For with this tightly reasoned defense of faith, he challenges the evangelists of doubt on their own ground. One by one, the arguments for unbelief fall before Keller\u2019s unrelenting logic. The claim that science has disproved religion comes in for particular scrutiny, as Keller deflects the antireligious syllogism that converts evolutionary theory into an obituary for orthodoxy. Keller even turns the tables on rationalists, adducing compelling evidence for scriptural doctrines, including the physical resurrection of Christ. And although Keller frankly acknowledges that inquisitors have justified atrocities as religious duties, he nonetheless traces the modern concept of human rights back to religious roots and exposes the fragility of such rights when shorn from those roots. We start down the road to Hitler\u2019s death camps and Stalin\u2019s gulag,\u00a0he warns, whenever we refuse to recognize in fellow humans the divine image of God. But by recognizing that image, Keller affirms, we open sacred possibilities not only for redemption in the hereafter but also for social justice here and now. Readers expecting Keller to deliver the usual pious bromides may experience a profound shock to their spiritual and social complacency. --Bryce Christensen\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t--This text refers to an alternate ", "Paperback", " edition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "There's a problem loading this menu right now.", "Learn more about Amazon Prime."], "Reviews": "1,253", "Average_Rating": "4.7 out of 5 stars", "ProductDetails": ["Paperback:", "310 pages", "Publisher:", "Penguin Books; Reprint edition (August 4, 2009)", "Language:", "English", "ISBN-10:", "1594483493", "ISBN-13:", "978-1594483493", "Product Dimensions:", "5.2 x 0.9 x 8 inches", "Shipping Weight:", "1 pounds (", "View shipping rates and policies", ")", "Average Customer Review:"]},

", "The way the sentence is written, the ambulance driver is barely speaking\u0097but surely that\u0092s not what the writer meant.

Really? With flowing black hair is in the wrong place in the sentence and should be placed after woman. That way, the sentence would read:  ", "Witnesses reported that the woman with flowing black hair was driving the getaway car.

", "That\u0092s quite a baby who can run a six-mile road race (even while being sick). The clause running in the six-mile road race is out of place; it should be closer to the noun it modifies (Mrs. Anderson). The sentence should be reworded this way:  ", "Running in the six-mile road race, Mrs. Anderson could not stop thinking about her sick baby.  ", "One of the most common problems with misplaced modifiers comes with what are called limiting modifiers\u0097words like almost, even, hardly, just, merely, nearly, only (only is the one misplaced most often), scarcely, and simply. To convey the correct meaning, limiting modifiers must be placed in front of the words they modify.  ", "Take a look at these sentences:  ", "Already, Mr. Goulooze has almost eaten four slabs of ribs!  ", "How does a person almost eat something? Did he have great willpower four different times?

The recent discovery of the first half of Twain's manuscript, long thought lost, made front-page news.  And this unprecedented edition, which contains for the first time omitted episodes and other variations present in the first half of the handwritten manuscript, as well as facsimile reproductions of thirty manuscript pages, is indispensable to a full understanding of the novel.  The changes, deletions, and additions made in the first half of the manuscript indicate that Mark Twain frequently checked his impulse to write an even darker, more confrontational book than the one he finally published.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "Considered the first great American novel, part of Finn's charm is the wisdom and sobering social criticism deftly lurking amongst the seemingly innocent observations of the uneducated Huck and the even-less-educated escaped slave, Jim. William Dufris's voice, unpretentious and disarming, like the book's main characters, seems the perfect armature on which to hang this literary strategy. Although he does an expert job with the entire cast, Dufris's delivery of Jim's dialogue is his crowning achievement. Out of context, Dufris's Jim might sound mocking and racist, due to his expert delivery of Twain's regional vernacular. Ignorance and intelligence, however, are not mutually exclusive, and taken as a whole, Jim's mind and heart come shining through, allowing the listener to reflect on their own assumptions.

Matthew Desmond does just that with ", "Evicted", " as he explores the stories of tenants and landlords in the poorest areas of Milwaukee during 2008 and 2009. It\u2019s almost always a compliment to say that a nonfiction book reads like a novel and this one does \u2013 mostly because Desmond gets very close to the \u201ccharacters,\u201d relating their words and thoughts and layering on enough vibrant details to make every rented property or trailer come alive.  You can almost forget that these are actual people with actual problems until he delivers a raw jolt of reality: the woman who\u2019s evicted because her boyfriend beats her up; the tenant whose baby daughter dies in a house fire; the tenant who pushes a \u201cfriend\u201d out a window for using all her cell phone minutes; the landlord who refuses to fix stopped-up pipes, so tenants allow garbage and sewage to pile up in the property. ", "Through both personal stories and data, Desmond proves that eviction undermines self, family, and community, bearing down disproportionately hard on women with children. In Milwaukee, being behind on rent gives landlords the opening to serve an eviction notice, which leads to a court date. On the face of it, it may seem easy to side with the landlords\u2014of course tenants should pay their rent. But as ", "Evicted", " pulls back layer after layer, what\u2019s exposed is a cycle of hurt that all parties\u2014landlord, tenant, city\u2014inflict on one another. Whether readers agree with Desmond\u2019s conclusions for how to break this cycle in order to strengthen families and neighborhoods, it\u2019s obvious by the end of ", "Evicted", " that there is no easy fix, and that people\u2014some addicts, some criminals\u2014will slip through the cracks. But it should be just as obvious that we must still try. ", "\"Astonishing...Desmond is an academic who teaches at Harvard\u2014a sociologist or, you could say, an ethnographer.

It regally combines policy reporting and ethnography, following eight families in Milwaukee as they struggle to find that most basic human necessity: shelter.

It remains his most studied and popular work; its insights into Negro life at the turn of the 20th century still ring true.", "  With a dash of the Victorian and Enlightenment influences that peppered his impassioned yet formal prose, the book's largely autobiographical chapters take the reader through the momentous and moody maze of Afro-American life after the Emancipation Proclamation: from poverty, the neoslavery of the sharecropper, illiteracy, miseducation, and lynching, to the heights of humanity reached by the spiritual \"sorrow songs\" that birthed gospel and the blues. The most memorable passages are contained in \"On Booker T. Washington and Others,\" where Du Bois criticizes his famous contemporary's rejection of higher education and accommodationist stance toward white racism: \"Mr. Washington's programme practically accepts the alleged inferiority of the Negro races,\" he writes, further complaining that Washington's thinking \"withdraws many of the high demands of Negroes as men and American citizens.\" The capstone of ", "The Souls of Black Folk", ", though, is Du Bois' haunting, eloquent description of the concept of the black psyche's \"double consciousness,\" which he described as \"a peculiar sensation.... One ever feels this twoness--an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\" Thanks to W.E.B. Du Bois' commitment and foresight--and the intellectual excellence expressed in this timeless literary gem--black Americans can today look in the mirror and rejoice in their beautiful black, brown, and beige reflections.

I just got my June LSAT score back, and was pleasantly surprised to have received a 179. My initial diagnostic placed me at 153, but after working with your two books, I was able to dramatically increase my speed and accuracy in logic games and logical reasoning. Your books are easy to understand and worth their weight in gold. Thank you!!! --Michael Wang<br \\><br \\>The Logic Games Bible was the single most effective tool I used to study for the games section. Everything was presented in a systematic way, which in turn helped me to think and perform in a systematic way during the actual exam. I highly recommend this book to all my friends taking the LSAT. --Prem Amarnani<br \\><br \\>I'm an LSAT instructor with another national prep company. I think the Logic Games Bible is a great resource for students focused on excelling on the section. In fact, it was the buzz amongst my students that led me to purchase the Logic Games Bible for review on my own time. --Jenny Steiger<br \\><br \\>I truly wish that someone had told me, before I took the LSAT, to throw out all my other useless testprep books (Kaplan and Princeton, here's looking at you) and just read the PowerScore Bibles. If someone had, I would not now be taking the test again. I noticed, for example, that certain techniques those books had taught me were leading me to complete logic games slower than I would have had I not been taught any techniques at all! Ha! Not so with the PowerScore Bible. Thanks to your book, I, a person who used to only be able to complete one logic game in the 35 minutes allotted, am now able to complete all four (and get them all right!) It's an LSAT miracle.

In college, he worked briefly for Kaplan but left when it became clear to him that the Kaplan method was irreconcilably different from the way he naturally thought about the test.  A few months after Mike graduated from college with a degree in linguistics, his younger brothers needed help with the SAT, so he taught them his approach to the test. Word of their success spread throughout their high school, and Mike was soon offering informal SAT tutoring to a few dozen of his brothers' friends.  One of those students recommended to Mike that he set up his own SAT preparation company. He thought about that for a couple of weeks and decided to pursue it.  Since then, Mike has used a variety of channels to help tens of thousands of students with the SAT, PSAT, ACT, GRE, LSAT, GMAT, ISEE, and SSAT. He regularly travels to work with students all across the United States, and consults with students all over the world through Skype. He speaks at live events as well, and is available for booking.  Mike's ACT strategies are so different from the traditional approach because he analyzes standardized tests from the ground up, rather than simply assuming that they cover the material they claim to cover.  In other words, most ACT tutors and courses teach the same math, reading, and writing skills that you learn in high school, because they mistakenly assume that the ACT is a test of college readiness. But Mike has looked carefully at large numbers of real ACT questions, and knows that they don't reward the same things that teachers reward in high school and college.  According to Mike, ACT questions generally rely on very basic concepts but present them in very strange ways. So students who want to improve their test scores shouldn't waste time re-learning what they've already learned in school - instead, they should learn how the ACT actually works, so they can take their existing knowledge and leverage it into a higher score.  And this is exactly what Mike teaches you to do in the ACT Prep Black Book.  If you want to understand how the ACT actually works, you need to read this book.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "There's a problem loading this menu right now.", "Learn more about Amazon Prime."], "Reviews": "142", "Average_Rating": "4.3 out of 5 stars", "ProductDetails": ["Paperback:", "436 pages", "Publisher:", "ACT Prep Books; 1 edition (April 6, 2014)", "Language:", "English", "ISBN-10:", "0692027912", "ISBN-13:", "978-0692027912", "Product Dimensions:", "8.5 x 1 x 11 inches", "Shipping Weight:", "2.9 pounds (", "View shipping rates and policies", ")", "Average Customer Review:"]},

Without this acceptance, he argues, the nation dooms itself to \"sterility and decay\" and to eventual destruction at the hands of the oppressed: \"The Negroes of this country may never be able to rise to power, but they are very well placed indeed to precipitate chaos and ring down the curtain on the American dream.\"", "  Baldwin's seething insights and directives, so disturbing to the white liberals and black moderates of his day, have become the starting point for discussions of American race relations: that debasement and oppression of one people by another is \"a recipe for murder\"; that \"color is not a human or a personal reality; it is a political reality\"; that whites can only truly liberate themselves when they liberate blacks, indeed when they \"become black\" symbolically and spiritually; that blacks and whites \"deeply need each other here\" in order for America to realize its identity as a nation. ", "  Yet despite its edgy tone and the strong undercurrent of violence, ", "The Fire Next Time", " is ultimately a hopeful and healing essay. Baldwin ranges far in these hundred pages--from a memoir of his abortive teenage religious awakening in Harlem (an interesting commentary on his first novel ", "Go Tell It on the Mountain", ") to a disturbing encounter with Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad. But what binds it all together is the eloquence, intimacy, and controlled urgency of the voice. Baldwin clearly paid in sweat and shame for every word in this text. What's incredible is that he managed to keep his cool. ", "--David Laskin", "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "Speakers or headsets will have to be turned up to listen to Jesse L. Martin's low, slow reading of Baldwin's classic long essay on racism and African-American identity. Martin seeks to be respectful of Baldwin, but he ends up rendering the meaning and the force of his work relatively inert. Pausing in poorly selected places, placing emphasis where little should be placed, Martin does not convey the precision and anger of Baldwin's prose. Instead, Baldwin's book becomes Great Literature, to be intoned and honored, but not truly grasped. Readers with an interest in Baldwin's work will be far better served by reading his prose to themselves than having Martin read it to them.

He's one of 13 people who receive Hannah's story, which details the circumstances that led to her suicide. Clay spends the rest of the day and long into the night listening to Hannah's voice and going to the locations she wants him to visit. The text alternates, sometimes quickly, between Hannah's voice (italicized) and Clay's thoughts as he listens to her words, which illuminate betrayals and secrets that demonstrate the consequences of even small actions. Hannah, herself, is not free from guilt, her own inaction having played a part in an accidental auto death and a rape. The message about how we treat one another, although sometimes heavy, makes for compelling reading. Give this to fans of Gail Giles psychological thrillers.

", " ", "William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (1868-1963) is the greatest of African American intellectuals--a sociologist, historian, novelist, and activist whose astounding career spanned the nation's history from Reconstruction to the civil rights movement. Born in Massachusetts and educated at Fisk, Harvard, and the University of Berlin, Du Bois penned his epochal masterpiece, ", "The Souls of Black Folk", ", in 1903. It remains his most studied and popular work; its insights into Negro life at the turn of the 20th century still ring true.", "  With a dash of the Victorian and Enlightenment influences that peppered his impassioned yet formal prose, the book's largely autobiographical chapters take the reader through the momentous and moody maze of Afro-American life after the Emancipation Proclamation: from poverty, the neoslavery of the sharecropper, illiteracy, miseducation, and lynching, to the heights of humanity reached by the spiritual \"sorrow songs\" that birthed gospel and the blues. The most memorable passages are contained in \"On Booker T. Washington and Others,\" where Du Bois criticizes his famous contemporary's rejection of higher education and accommodationist stance toward white racism: \"Mr. Washington's programme practically accepts the alleged inferiority of the Negro races,\" he writes, further complaining that Washington's thinking \"withdraws many of the high demands of Negroes as men and American citizens.\" The capstone of ", "The Souls of Black Folk", ", though, is Du Bois' haunting, eloquent description of the concept of the black psyche's \"double consciousness,\" which he described as \"a peculiar sensation.... One ever feels this twoness--an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\" Thanks to W.E.B. Du Bois' commitment and foresight--and the intellectual excellence expressed in this timeless literary gem--black Americans can today look in the mirror and rejoice in their beautiful black, brown, and beige reflections.

A soc (short for \"social\") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny  kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the  same whether a soc or a greaser. This classic, written by S. E.

What Harry has to face  as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected?

Zusak not only creates a mesmerizing and original story but also writes with poetic syntax, causing readers to deliberate over phrases and lines, even as the action impels them forward.

The exploits of Harry and his friends captivate even the shortest attention spans by engaging the imagination with vivid characters and fast-moving action, instead of trying to merely catch the eye with colorful pictures or pop-up effects. Not surprisingly, the Potter tales sound wonderful read aloud, and adapt to the audiobook format extremely well. Broadway actor Jim Dale's impressive vocal range gives each character in the book its own distinctive voice--a considerable task, given the pantheon of witches, warlocks, ghosts, ghouls, dwarves, and elves that Harry encounters in his second outing. And thankfully, since the book is read unabridged, no one's favorite character is omitted. Engaging for children without being childish, the audio version of ", "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", " is worthy addition to the deservedly popular series.

Reluctantly spending the summer with the Dursleys, his mean relatives who fear and detest magic, Harry is soon whisked away by his friends Ron, Fred, and George Weasley, who appear at his window in a flying Ford Anglia to take him away to enjoy the rest of the holidays with their very wizardly family. Things don't go as well, though, when the school term begins. Someone, or something, is (literally) petrifying Hogwarts' residents one by one and leaving threatening messages referring to a Chamber of Secrets and an heir of Slytherin. Somehow, Harry is often around when the attacks happen and he is soon suspected of being the perpetrator. The climax has Harry looking very much like Indiana Jones, battling a giant serpent in the depths of the awesome and terrible Chamber of Secrets. Along with most of the teachers and students introduced in the previous book, Draco Malfoy has returned for his second year and is more despicable than ever. The novel is marked throughout by the same sly and sophisticated humor found in the first book, along with inventive, new, matter-of-fact uses of magic that will once again have readers longing to emulate Harry and his wizard friends.", "Susan L.

Mainstream science - as well as religious and cultural institutions - has maintained that men and women evolved in families in which a man's possessions and protection were exchanged for a woman's fertility and fidelity. But this narrative is collapsing. Fewer and fewer couples are getting married, and divorce rates keep climbing as adultery and flagging libido drag down even seemingly solid marriages. ", "How can reality be reconciled with the accepted narrative? It can't be, according to renegade thinkers Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha. While debunking almost everything we \"know\" about sex, they offer a bold alternative explanation in this provocative and brilliant book. ", "Ryan and Jetha's central contention is that human beings evolved in egalitarian groups that shared food, child care, and, often, sexual partners. Weaving together convergent, frequently overlooked evidence from anthropology, archaeology, primatology, anatomy, and psychosexuality, the authors show how far from human nature monogamy really is. Human beings everywhere and in every era have confronted the same familiar, intimate situations in surprisingly different ways. The authors expose the ancient roots of human sexuality while pointing toward a more optimistic future illuminated by our innate capacities for love, cooperation, and generosity.

Fortunately for the nerve-shaken, over-civilized people of then and now, President Woodrow Wilson created the National Parks Service (NPS) on August 25, 1916, though the drive to protect some of America's most remarkable wild spaces, to be 'used and preserved for the benefit of mankind', began in the 1860s.

Ascending to the imperial throne in A.D. 161, Aurelius found his reign beset by natural disasters and war. In the wake of these challenges, he set down a series of private reflections, outlining a philosophy of commitment to virtue above pleasure and tranquility above happiness.", "Reflecting the emperor's own noble and self-sacrificing code of conduct, this eloquent and moving work draws and enriches the tradition of Stoicism, which stressed the search for inner peace and ethical certainty in an apparently chaotic world. Serenity was to be achieved by emulating in one's personal conduct the underlying orderliness and lawfulness of nature. And in the face of inevitable pain, loss, and death \u2014 the suffering at the core of life \u2014 Aurelius counsels stoic detachment from the things that are beyond one's control and a focus on one's own will and perception.", "Presented here in a specially modernized version of the classic George Long translation, this updated and revised edition is easily accessible to contemporary readers.

The ", "Meditations", " of Marcus Aurelius, translated and introduced by Gregory Hays, by that standard, is very worthwhile, indeed. Hays suggests that its most recent incarnation--as a self-help book--is not only valid, but may be close to the author's intent. The book, which Hays calls, fondly, a \"haphazard set of notes,\" is indicative of the role of philosophy among the ancients in that it is \"expected to provide a 'design for living.'\" And it does, both aphoristically (\"Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what's left and live it properly.\") and rhetorically (\"What is it in ourselves that we should prize?\"). Whether these, and other entries (\"Enough of this wretched, whining monkey life.\") sound life-changing or like entries in a teenager's diary is up to the individual reader, as it should be. Hays's introduction, which sketches the life of Marcus Aurelius (emperor of Rome A.D. 161-180) as well as the basic tenets of stoicism, is accessible and jaunty.  ", "--H.

Some of the characterizations are peculiar--why do the centaurs have Welsh accents?--but that's a small price to pay to hear one of the myriad ways to sing the Hogwarts School song.

For centuries they have practiced techniques that allow them to run hundreds of miles without rest and chase down anything from a deer to an Olympic marathoner while enjoying every mile of it. Their superhuman talent is matched by uncanny health and serenity, leaving the Tarahumara immune to the diseases and strife that plague modern existence. With the help of Caballo Blanco, a mysterious loner who lives among the tribe, the author was able not only to uncover the secrets of the Tarahumara but also to find his own inner ultra-athlete, as he trained for the challenge of a lifetime: a fifty-mile race through the heart of Tarahumara country pitting the tribe against an odd band of Americans, including a star ultramarathoner, a beautiful young surfer, and a barefoot wonder.", "With a sharp wit and wild exuberance, McDougall takes us from the high-tech science labs at Harvard to the sun-baked valleys and freezing peaks across North America, where ever-growing numbers of ultrarunners are pushing their bodies to the limit, and, finally, to the climactic race in the Copper Canyons. ", "Born to Run", " is that rare book that will not only engage your mind but inspire your body when you realize that the secret to happiness is right at your feet, and that you, indeed all of us, were born to run.", "  ", "Question:", " ", "Born to Run", " explores the life and running habits of the Tarahumara Indians of Mexico\u2019s Copper Canyon, arguably the greatest distance runners in the world. What are some of the secrets you learned from them?", "Christopher McDougall:", " The key secret hit me like a thunderbolt. It was so simple, yet such a jolt. It was this: everything I\u2019d been taught about running was wrong. We treat running in the modern world the same way we treat childbirth\u2014it\u2019s going to hurt, and requires special exercises and equipment, and the best you can hope for is to get it over with quickly with minimal damage.", "Then I meet the Tarahumara, and they\u2019re having a blast. They remember what it\u2019s like to love running, and it lets them blaze through the canyons like dolphins rocketing through waves. For them, running isn\u2019t work. It isn\u2019t a punishment for eating. It\u2019s fine art, like it was for our ancestors. Way before we were scratching pictures on caves or beating rhythms on hollow trees, we were perfecting the art of combining our breath and mind and muscles into fluid self-propulsion over wild terrain. And when our ancestors finally did make their first cave paintings, what were the first designs? A downward slash, lightning bolts through the bottom and middle\u2014behold, the Running Man.", "The Tarahumara have a saying: \u201cChildren run before they can walk.\u201d Watch any four-year-old\u2014they do everything at full speed, and it\u2019s all about fun. That\u2019s the most important thing I picked up from my time in the Copper Canyons, the understanding that running can be fast and fun and spontaneous, and when it is, you feel like you can go forever. But all of that begins with your feet. Strange as it sounds, the Tarahumara taught me to change my relationship with the ground. Instead of hammering down on my heels, the way I\u2019d been taught all my life, I learned to run lightly and gently on the balls of my feet. The day I mastered it was the last day I was ever injured. ", "Q:", " You trained for your first ultramarathon\u2014a race organized by the mysterious gringo expat Caballo Blanco between the Tarahumara and some of America\u2019s top ultrarunners\u2014while researching and writing this book. What was your training like?", "CM:", " It really started as kind of a dare. Just by chance, I\u2019d met an adventure-sports coach from Jackson Hole, Wyoming named Eric Orton. Eric\u2019s specialty is tearing endurance sports down to their basic components and looking for transferable skills. He studies rock climbing to find shoulder techniques for kayakers, and applies Nordic skiing\u2019s smooth propulsion to mountain biking. What he\u2019s looking for are basic engineering principles, because he\u2019s convinced that the next big leap forward in fitness won\u2019t come from strength or technology, but plain, simple durability. With some 70% of all runners getting hurt every year, the athlete who can stay healthy and avoid injury will leave the competition behind.", "So naturally, Eric idolized the Tarahumara. Any tribe that has 90-year-old men running across mountaintops obviously has a few training tips up its sleeve. But since Eric had never actually met the Tarahumara, he had to deduce their methods by pure reasoning. His starting point was uncertainty; he assumed that the Tarahumara step into the unknown every time they leave their caves, because they never know how fast they\u2019ll have to sprint after a rabbit or how tricky the climbing will be if they\u2019re caught in a storm. They never even know how long a race will be until they step up to the starting line\u2014the distance is only determined in a last-minute bout of negotiating and could stretch anywhere from 50 miles to 200-plus.", "Eric figured shock and awe was the best way for me to build durability and mimic Tarahumara-style running. He\u2019d throw something new at me every day\u2014hopping drills, lunges, mile intervals\u2014and lots and lots of hills. There was no such thing, really, as long, slow distance\u2014he\u2019d have me mix lots of hill repeats and short bursts of speed into every mega-long run.", "I didn\u2019t think I could do it without breaking down, and I told Eric that from the start. I basically defied him to turn me into a runner. And by the end of nine months, I was cranking out four hour runs without a problem.", "Q:", " You\u2019re a six-foot four-inches tall, 200-plus pound guy\u2014not anyone\u2019s typical vision of a distance runner, yet you\u2019ve completed ultra marathons and are training for more. Is there a body type for running, as many of us assume, or are all humans built to run?", "CM:", " Yeah, I\u2019m a big\u2019un. But isn\u2019t it sad that\u2019s even a reasonable question? I bought into that bull for a loooong time. Why wouldn\u2019t I? I was constantly being told by people who should know better that \u201csome bodies aren\u2019t designed for running.\u201d One of the best sports medicine physicians in the country told me exactly that\u2014that the reason I was constantly getting hurt is because I was too big to handle the impact shock from my feet hitting the ground. Just recently, I interviewed a nationally-known sports podiatrist who said, \u201cYou know, we didn\u2019t ALL evolve to run away from saber-toothed tigers.\u201d Meaning, what? That anyone who isn\u2019t sleek as a Kenyan marathoner should be extinct? It\u2019s such illogical blather\u2014all kinds of body types exist today, so obviously they DID evolve to move quickly on their feet. It\u2019s really awful that so many doctors are reinforcing this learned helplessness, this idea that you have to be some kind of elite being to handle such a basic, universal movement. ", "Q:", " If humans are born to run, as you argue, what\u2019s your advice for a runner who is looking to make the leap from shorter road races to marathons, or marathons to ultramarathons? Is running really for everyone?", "CM:", " I think ultrarunning is America\u2019s hope for the future. Honestly. The ultrarunners have got a hold of some powerful wisdom. You can see it at the starting line of any ultra race. I showed up at the Leadville Trail 100 expecting to see a bunch of hollow-eyed Skeletors, and instead it was, \u201cWhoah! Get a load of the hotties!\u201d Ultra runners tend to be amazingly healthy, youthful and\u2014believe it or not\u2014good looking. I couldn\u2019t figure out why, until one runner explained that throughout history, the four basic ingredients for optimal health have been clean air, good food, fresh water and low stress. And that, to a T, describes the daily life of an ultrarunner. They\u2019re out in the woods for hours at a time, breathing pine-scented breezes, eating small bursts of digestible food, downing water by the gallons, and feeling their stress melt away with the miles. But here\u2019s the real key to that kingdom: you have to relax and enjoy the run. No one cares how fast you run 50 miles, so ultrarunners don\u2019t really stress about times. They\u2019re out to enjoy the run and finish strong, not shave a few inconsequential seconds off a personal best. And that\u2019s the best way to transition up to big mileage races: as coach Eric told me, \u201cIf it feels like work, you\u2019re working too hard.\u201d ", "Q:", " You write that distance running is the great equalizer of age and gender. Can you explain?", "CM:", " Okay, I\u2019ll answer that question with a question: Starting at age nineteen, runners get faster every year until they hit their peak at twenty-seven. After twenty-seven, they start to decline. So if it takes you eight years to reach your peak, how many years does it take for you to regress back to the same speed you were running at nineteen?", "Go ahead, guess all you want. No one I\u2019ve asked has ever come close. It\u2019s in the book, so I won\u2019t give it away, but I guarantee when you hear the answer, you\u2019ll say, \u201cNo way. THAT old?\u201d Now, factor in this: ultra races are the only sport in the world in which women can go toe-to-toe with men and hand them their heads. Ann Trason and Krissy Moehl often beat every man in the field in some ultraraces, while Emily Baer recently finished in the Top 10 at the Hardrock 100 while stopping to breastfeed her baby at the water stations.", "So how\u2019s that possible? According to a new body of research, it\u2019s because humans are the greatest distance runners on earth. We may not be fast, but we\u2019re born with such remarkable natural endurance that humans are fully capable of outrunning horses, cheetahs and antelopes.

And he was right, sort of. I instinctively began eating smaller, more digestible meals as my miles increased, but then I went behind his back and consulted with the great Dr. Ruth Heidrich, an Ironman triathlete who lives on a vegan diet. She\u2019s the one who gave me the idea of having salad for breakfast, and it\u2019s a fantastic tip. The truth is, many of the greatest endurance athletes of all time lived on fruits and vegetables.

Adapted, in moderation, for American customs in this edition (cricket is gone, rugby remains; conkers are out, Navajo Code Talkers in), ", "The Dangerous Book", " is a guide book for dads as well as their sons, as a reminder of lore and technique that have not yet been completely lost to the digital age. Recall the adventures of Scott of the Antarctic and the Battle of the Somme, relearn how to palm a coin, tan a skin, and, most charmingly, wrap a package in brown paper and string. The book's ambitions are both modest and winningly optimistic: you get the sense that by learning how to place a splint or write in invisible ink, a boy might be prepared for anything, even girls (which warrant a small but wise chapter of their own).  ", " ", "Inside ", "The Dangerous Book for Boys", " ", "  ", " ", "Questions for Conn Iggulden", " ", " Conn and Hal Iggulden are two brothers who have not forgotten what it was like to be boys. Conn taught for many years before becoming one of the most admired and popular young historical novelists with his Emperor series, based on the life of Julius Caesar, and his newly embarked series on Genghis Khan, while Hal is a theater director. We asked Conn about their collaboration. ", " ", "Amazon.com:", " It's difficult to describe what a phenomenon ", "The Dangerous Book for Boys", " was in the UK last year. When I would check the bestseller list on our sister site, Amazon.co.uk, there would be, along with your book, which spent much of the year at the top of the list, a half-dozen apparent knockoff books of similar boy knowledge. Clearly, you tapped into something big. What do you think it was? ", "Iggulden:", " In a word, fathers. I am one myself and I think we've become aware that the whole \"health and safety\" overprotective culture isn't doing our sons any favors. Boys need to learn about risk. They need to fall off things occasionally, or--and this is the important bit--they'll take worse risks on their own. If we do away with challenging playgrounds and cancel school trips for fear of being sued, we don't end up with safer boys--we end up with them walking on train tracks. In the long run, it's not safe at all to keep our boys in the house with a Playstation. It's not good for their health or their safety. ", " You only have to push a boy on a swing to see how much enjoys the thrill of danger. It's hard-wired. Remove any opportunity to test his courage and they'll find ways to test themselves that will be seriously dangerous for everyone around them. I think of it like playing the lottery--someone has to say \"Look, you ", "won't", " win--and your children ", "won't", " be hurt. Relax. It ", "won't", " be you.\"  ", " I think that's the core of the book's success. It isn't just a collection of things to do. The heroic stories alone are something we haven't had for too long. It isn't about climbing Everest, but it is an attitude, a philosophy for fathers and sons. Our institutions are too wrapped up in terror over being sued--so we have to do things with them ourselves. This book isn't a bad place to start. ", " As for knockoff books--great. They'll give my son something to read that doesn't involve him learning a dull moral lesson of some kind--just enjoying an adventure or learning skills and crafts so that he has a feeling of competence and confidence--just as we have. ", "Amazon.com:", " You made some changes for the U.S. edition, and I for one am sorry that you have removed the section on conkers, if only because it's such a lovely and mysterious word. What are (or what is) conkers? ", "Iggulden:", " Horse chestnuts strung on a shoelace and knocked against one another until they shatter. In the entire history of the world, no one has ever been hurt by a conker, but it's still been banned by some British schools, ", "just in case", ". Another school banned paper airplanes. Honestly, it's enough to make you weep, if I did that sort of thing, which I try not to. Reading Jane Austen is still allowed, however. ", "Amazon.com:", " What knowledge did you decide was important to add for American boys? I notice in both editions you have an excellent and useful section on table football, as played with coins. Is paper football strictly an American pastime? I'm not sure I could have gotten through the fourth grade without it. ", "Iggulden:", " I like knowing the details of battles, so Gettysburg and the Alamo had to go in, along with the Gettysburg address, stickball, state capitals, U.S. mountains, American trees, insects, U.S. historical timelines, and a lot of others. Navajo code talkers of WWII is a great chapter. It probably helps that I am a huge fan of America. It was only while rewriting for the U.S. that I realized how many positive references there already are. You have NASA and NASA trumps almost anything.  ", " As for paper football, ever since I thought of putting the book together, people keep saying things like \"You have rockets in there, yes? Everyone loves rockets!\" Paper football is the first American one, but there will be many others. No book in the world is long enough to put them all in--unless we do a sequel, of course. ", "Amazon.com:", " Do you think ", "The Dangerous Book for Boys", " is being read by actual boys, or only by nostalgic adults? Have you seen boys getting up from their Xboxes to go outside and perform first aid or tan animal skins or build go-carts? ", "Iggulden:", " I've had a lot of emails and letters from boys who loved the book--as well as fathers. I've had responses from kids as young as ten and an old man of 87, who pointed out a problem with the shadow stick that we've since changed. The thing to remember is that we may be older and more cynical every year, but boys simply aren't. If they are given the chance to make a go-cart with their dad, they jump at it. Mine did. Nothing gives me more pleasure than to know the book is being used with fathers and sons together, trying things out. Nothing is more valuable to a boy than time with his dad, learning something fun--or something difficult. That's part of the attitude too. If it's hard, you don't make it easy, you grab it by the throat and hang on for as long as it takes. ", " The book is often bought by fathers, of course. Their sons don't know Scott of the Antarctic is a great adventure story. How could they if it isn't taught any more? Good, heroic stories don't appear much in modern school curriculums--and then we wonder why boys don't seem interested. ", "Amazon.com:", " And finally, on to the important questions: Should Pluto still be a planet? And what was the best dinosaur? ", "Iggulden:", " Pluto is a planet. I know there are scientists who say it isn't, but it's big enough to be round and it has a moon, for crying out loud. Of course it's a planet. Give it ten years and they'll be agreeing with me again. ", " As for the best dinosaur, it depends what you mean by best. For sheer perfection, it probably has to be the shark and the crocodile. Modern ones are smaller but their record for sheer survival is pretty impressive. I only hope humanity can do as well. The only thing that will stop us is worrying too much. ", "Grade 4-8\u2013Intentionally old-fashioned and politically incorrect, this eclectic collection addresses the undeniable boy-appeal of certain facts and activities. Dozens of short chapters, in fairly random order, cover a wide range of topics in conversational prose. Simple instructions for coin tricks and paper airplanes alternate with excerpts from history such as Famous Battles and facts about ancient wonders of the world and astronomy. The dangerous aspect is more apparent in such chapters as Making Cloth Fireproof, and Hunting and Cooking a Rabbit, but also applies to the overall premise that action is fun and can be worth the risks. A section on stickball, for instance, includes advice to possibly flee the vicinity in the event of a broken window. The information is appropriately concise. The knot-tying section, for example, sticks to five basic varieties with clear instructions and useful diagrams. Occasional topics such as Marbling Paper and Latin Phrases Every Boy Should Know may not fit the stereotypical interests of young males, but support the general theme of cultivating curiosity. The authors refer to their own experiences as they tested the activities, lending an appealing personal tone. Tongue-in-cheek humor emerges throughout, notably in eight bits of advice offered in the chapter called Girls. Already a best seller in England, this American edition features several adjustments, such as substituting The Declaration of Independence for Patron Saints of Britain. Both premise and content should appeal to many boys, and might be even more successful when nostalgic dads join in.\u2013", "Steven Engelfried, Multnomah County Library, OR", " ", "Copyright \u00a9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

", " ", "Billy Beane, general manager of MLB's Oakland A's and protagonist of Michael Lewis's ", "Moneyball", ", had a problem: how to win in the Major Leagues with a budget that's smaller than that of nearly every other team. Conventional wisdom long held that big name, highly athletic hitters and young pitchers with rocket arms were the ticket to success. But Beane and his staff, buoyed by massive amounts of carefully interpreted statistical data, believed that wins could be had by more affordable methods such as hitters with high on-base percentage and pitchers who get lots of ground outs. Given this information and a tight budget, Beane defied tradition and his own scouting department to build winning teams of young affordable players and inexpensive castoff veterans. ", "  Lewis was in the room with the A's top management as they spent the summer of 2002 adding and subtracting players and he provides outstanding play-by-play. In the June player draft, Beane acquired nearly every prospect he coveted (few of whom were coveted by other teams) and at the July trading deadline he engaged in a tense battle of nerves to acquire a lefty reliever. Besides being one of the most insider accounts ever written about baseball, ", "Moneyball", " is populated with fascinating characters. We meet Jeremy Brown, an overweight college catcher who most teams project to be a 15th round draft pick (Beane takes him in the first). Sidearm pitcher Chad Bradford is plucked from the White Sox triple-A club to be a key set-up man and catcher Scott Hatteberg is rebuilt as a first baseman. But the most interesting character is Beane himself. A speedy athletic can't-miss prospect who somehow missed, Beane reinvents himself as a front-office guru, relying on players completely unlike, say, Billy Beane. Lewis, one of the top nonfiction writers of his era (", "Liar's Poker", ", ", "The New New Thing", "), offers highly accessible explanations of baseball stats and his roadmap of Beane's economic approach makes ", "Moneyball", " an appealing reading experience for business people and sports fans alike.

Given the heavily publicized salaries of players for teams like the Boston Red Sox or New York Yankees, baseball insiders and fans assume that the biggest talents deserve and get the biggest salaries. However, argues Lewis, little-known numbers and statistics matter more. Lewis discusses Bill James and his annual stats newsletter, Baseball Abstract, along with other mathematical analysis of the game. Surprisingly, though, most managers have not paid attention to this research, except for Billy Beane, general manager of the A's and a former player; according to Lewis, \"[B]y the beginning of the 2002 season, the Oakland A's, by winning so much with so little, had become something of an embarrassment to Bud Selig and, by extension, Major League Baseball.\" The team's success is actually a shrewd combination of luck, careful player choices and Beane's first-rate negotiating skills. Beane knows which players are likely to be traded by other teams, and he manages to involve himself even when the trade is unconnected to the A's. \" `Trawling' is what he called this activity,\" writes Lewis. \"His constant chatter was a way of keeping tabs on the body of information critical to his trading success.\" Lewis chronicles Beane's life, focusing on his uncanny ability to find and sign the right players.

Stephen Curry has had an electrifying basketball career playing in the National Basketball Association. In this Stephen Curry biography, we will learn about how Steph became the star point guard that he is today.

Following an MVP season with extraordinary numbers early into the 2015-2016 NBA season, the future is bright for young Curry as he works to lead the Warriors to a back-to-back championship this year alongside his supporting cast of Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Andrew Bogut.", "Here is a preview of what is inside this book:", " ", "An excerpt from the book:", "We were all taught that children inherit the genes of their parents. Their physical appearance and sometimes even their disease history becomes part of who we are. Most of the time, we also copy their attitudes and mannerisms. In the case of Wardell \u201cSteph\u201d Curry, one couldn\u2019t help but wonder if he also inherited his NBA father Dell Curry\u2019s shooting touch. An NBA pundit said that great shooters are not made, they are born.   ", "Fans of the league have been very privileged to watch some of the greatest shooters that ever played the game. From the likes of Pete Maravich, Larry Bird, former three-point record holder Reggie Miller, and the one who unseated him, Ray Allen, we have witnessed the greatest shooting displays on the planet. However, some scribes rate Steph Curry, even in the early stages of his career, as the greatest shooter in history. Although this is still debatable, some of Curry\u2019s performances have backed up this somewhat outrageous statement, especially to loyal Miller or Allen fans. On February 27, 2013, Curry lit up Madison Square Garden, scoring a career-best 54 points, including 11 of 13 from deep. He also owns the league record for three-pointers made in a single season with 272, set during the 2012-13 season, breaking Allen\u2019s record.

Awed by merely the camping section of his local sporting goods store, he nevertheless plunges into the wilderness and emerges with a consistently comical account of a neophyte woodsman learning hard lessons about self-reliance. Bryson (The Lost Continent) carries himself in an irresistibly bewildered manner, accepting each new calamity with wonder and hilarity. He reviews the characters of the AT (as the trail is called), from a pack of incompetent Boy Scouts to a perpetually lost geezer named Chicken John. Most amusing is his cranky, crude and inestimable companion, Katz, a reformed substance abuser who once had single-handedly \"become, in effect, Iowa's drug culture.\" The uneasy but always entertaining relationship between Bryson and Katz keeps their walk interesting, even during the flat stretches. Bryson completes the trail as planned, and he records the misadventure with insight and elegance.

Nursing homes, preoccupied with safety, pin patients into railed beds and wheelchairs. Hospitals isolate the dying, checking for vital signs long after the goals of cure have become moot.

But really. . .it is to enable well-being. And well-being is about the reasons one wishes to be alive.\u201d Through interviews with doctors, stories from and about health care providers (such as the woman who pioneered the notion of \u201cassisted living\u201d for the elderly)\u2014and eventually, by way of the story of his own father\u2019s dying, Gawande examines the cracks in the system of health care to the aged (i.e. 97 percent of medical students take no course in geriatrics) and to the seriously ill who might have different needs and expectations than the ones family members predict. (One striking example: the terminally ill former professor who told his daughter that \u201cquality of life\u201d for him meant the ongoing ability to enjoy chocolate ice cream and watch football on TV. If medical treatments might remove those pleasures, well, then, he wasn\u2019t sure he would submit to such treatments.) Doctors don\u2019t listen, Gawande suggests\u2014or, more accurately, they don\u2019t know what to listen for. (Gawande includes examples of his own failings in this area.) Besides, they\u2019ve been trained to want to find cures, attack problems\u2014to win. But victory doesn\u2019t look the same to everyone, he asserts. Yes, \u201cdeath is the enemy,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut the enemy has superior forces. Eventually, it wins. And in a war that you cannot win, you don\u2019t want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You don\u2019t want Custer. You want Robert E. Lee... someone who knows how to fight for territory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can\u2019t.\u201d In his compassionate, learned way, Gawande shows all of us\u2014doctors included\u2014how mortality must be faced, with both heart and mind. \u2013 ", "Sara Nelson", "\u201c", "Being Mortal", ", Atul Gawande's masterful exploration of aging, death, and the medical profession's mishandling of both, is his best and most personal book yet.\u201d \u2015", "Boston Globe", "\u201cAmerican medicine, ", "Being Mortal", " reminds us, has prepared itself for life but not for death.

In boyhood, he'd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile.

He hosts an annual bodybuilding contest in Columbus, Ohio, and allows a column to be ghost-written under his name in a muscle magazine. Today's bodybuilders may have bigger muscles than Arnold ever did, but everyone inside and outside the iron game gives him credit for exponentially broadening the popularity of physique training.", "  With this updated ", "Encyclopedia", " (it was originally published in 1985), Schwarzenegger wraps his huge arms around the entire sport. He hits the history of bodybuilding, the champions (he's quite generous in his praise of predecessors, contemporaries, and successors alike), the training systems.  Some of the information is more bodybuilding lore than science; for example, exercises are said to \"expand the rib cage\" or develop the \"inner\" or \"outer\" chest, all physiological impossibilities. But they're still good exercises, and the book includes every movement imaginable for every muscle group.", "  If you love the sport of bodybuilding, you'll want this book in your library, if for no other reason than to feast your eyes on the hundreds of photos of the best physiques in the history of the sport.

", "   ", "To get the free app, enter your mobile phone number.", "What Doesn't Kill Us", " traces our evolutionary journey back to a time when survival depended on how well we adapted to the environment around us. Our ancestors crossed the Alps in animal skins and colonized the New World in loin cloths. They evaded predators and built civilizations with just their raw brainpower and inner grit. But things have changed, and now comfort is king. Today we live in the thrall of constant climate control and exercise only when our office schedules permit. The technologies that we use to make us comfortable are so all-encompassing that they sever the biological link to a changing environment. Now we hate the cold and the heat. We suffer from autoimmune diseases. And many of us are chronically overweight. Most of us don't even realize that natural variation - sweating and shivering - is actually good for us. ", "What Doesn't Kill Us", " uncovers how just about anyone can reclaim a measure of our species' evolutionary strength by tapping in to the things that feel uncomfortable. When we slightly reimagine how our bodies fit into the world, we can condition ourselves to find resilience in unfamiliar environments. ", "The feeling that something is missing from our daily routines is growing and has spawned a movement. Every year millions of people forgo traditional gyms and push the limits of human endurance by doing boot camp-style workouts in raw conditions. These extreme athletes train in CrossFit boxes, compete in Tough Mudders, and challenge themselves in Spartan races. They are connecting with their environment and, whether they realize it or not, are changing their bodies. ", "No one exemplifies this better than Dutch fitness guru Wim Hof, whose remarkable ability to control his body temperature in extreme cold has sparked a whirlwind of scientific study. Because of him scientists in the United States and Europe are just beginning to understand how cold adaptation might help combat autoimmune diseases and chronic pain and, in some cases, even reverse diabetes. ", "Award-winning investigative journalist Scott Carney dives into the fundamental philosophy at the root of this movement in three interlocking narratives. His own journey culminates in a record-bending 28-hour climb up to the snowy peak of Mt. Kilimanjaro wearing nothing but a pair of running shorts and sneakers.

Instead of serving up technique, it concentrated on the fact that, as Gallwey wrote, \"Every game is composed of two parts, an outer game and an inner game.\" The former is played against opponents, and is filled with lots of contradictory advice; the latter is played not against, but within the mind of the player, and its principal obstacles are self-doubt and anxiety. Gallwey's revolutionary thinking, built on a foundation of Zen thinking and humanistic psychology, was really a primer on how to get out of your own way to let your best game emerge. It was sports psychology before the two words were pressed against each other and codified into an accepted discipline.", " The new edition of this remarkable work--Billie Jean King called the original her tennis bible--refines Gallwey's theories on concentration, gamesmanship, breaking bad habits, learning to trust yourself on the court, and awareness. \"No matter what a person's complaint when he has a lesson with me, I have found the most beneficial first step,\" he stressed, \"is to encourage him to ", "see", " and ", "feel", " what he is doing--that is, to increase his awareness of ", "what actually is", ".\" ", " There are aspects of psychobabble and mysticism to be found here, sure, but Gallwey instructs as much by anecdote as anything else, and time has ultimately proved him a guru.

When investigative journalist and anthropologist Carney heard about Hof\u2019s mind-boggling methods and claims that he could \u201chack\u201d the human body, he knew he had to venture to Poland to expose this fraud. But in just a few days, Hof changed Carney\u2019s mind, and so began a friendship and a new adventure. Carney now chronicles his journey to push himself mentally and physically using Wim Hof\u2019s method of cold exposure, breath-holding, and meditation to tap into our primal selves. Our ancestors survived harsh conditions without modern technology, while we live in comfortable bubbles with little to struggle against and wonder how they survived. The question is, ", "What happens when we push our bodies to the limit?", " Carney calls on evolutionary biology and other modern scientific disciplines to explore and explain Hof\u2019s unconventional methods. Fresh and exciting, this book has wide appeal for readers interested in health, sports, self-improvement, and extreme challenges.", "\u2015", "Booklist", "As this engaging autoethnography relates, anthropologist and investigative journalist Carney was skeptical upon encountering a photo of a nearly naked Wim Hof sitting on a glacier in the Arctic Circle. Hof, a Dutch fitness guru who runs a training camp in Poland\u2019s wilderness, claims he can control his body temperature and immune system solely with his mind; though Carney set out to prove Hof a charlatan, he was instead won over. Carney documents his interactions with Hof and the many others who have learned to control their bodies in seemingly impossible ways: he learned Hof\u2019s breathing techniques for tricking the body into doing things it isn\u2019t evolutionarily designed for, and underwent training to face extreme cold while barely clothed. It is this training that enables Hof and Carney to summit Mt. Kilimanjaro in 28 hours while wearing shorts. This is part guide and part popular science book; readers will learn about how Neanderthals used the body\u2019s \u201cbrown fat\u201d to keep warm and how exposure nearly reverses the symptoms of diabetes. The accomplishments Carney documents are unbelievable and fascinating; this isn\u2019t a how-to for those looking to perform extraordinary feats, but it is an entertaining account that will appeal to the adventurous.", "\u2015", "Publishers Weekly", "On the heels of the paleo diet comes a new claim: taking on the physical challenges of the environment faced by our prehistoric ancestors can undo what easy calories and effortless comfort have done to our bodies\u2015made them fat, lazy, and weak.", "In his latest book, investigative journalist and anthropologist Carney (A Death on Diamond Mountain: A True Story of Obsession, Madness, and the Path to Enlightenment, 2015, etc.) expands on his 2014 Playboy piece, \u201cThe Iceman Cometh,\u201d in which he profiled Dutch fitness guru Wim Hof and experienced Hof\u2019s strenuous training methods, some of which involve exposing the near-naked body to snow and icy water. At first skeptical, Carney became convinced by the changes he experienced in his own body. The narrative is filled with personal details that will engage, astonish, and even repel readers. Expanding on his unnerving close-up account, the author also examines the research being done on the role of brown adipose tissue in the body and a variety of military and sports medicine training practices. He cites the anecdotal evidence of people who have placed their faith in Hof and are convinced that his techniques have changed, if not saved, their lives\u2015e.g., sufferers of Parkinson\u2019s disease, Crohn\u2019s disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. As a climax to his account, Carney describes how, stripped to the waist, he accompanied Hof on a climb to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa\u2019s highest peak. In the epilogue, the author asserts that his experiences showed him that \u201cexposure to cold helps reconfigure the cardiovascular system, combat autoimmune malfunctions, and is a pretty darned good method to simply lose weight.\u201d Hof provides the book\u2019s foreword.", "Couch potatoes take warning: the experiences described in this testimonial are often tough to read about, and the conclusions, while sometimes convincing, might best be taken with a touch of skepticism.", "\u2015", "Kirkus", "\u201cScott Carney is so curious about getting to the truth of things that he is willing to endure great pain and suffering to get there.

It's been yet another infuriating and boring summer with the despicable Dursleys, this time with minimal contact from our hero's non-Muggle friends from school. Harry is feeling especially edgy at the lack of news from the magic world, wondering when the freshly revived evil Lord Voldemort will strike. Returning to Hogwarts will be a relief... or will it?", "  The fifth book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series follows the darkest year yet for our young wizard, who finds himself knocked down a peg or three after the events of last year. Somehow, over the summer, gossip (usually traced back to the magic world's newspaper, the ", "Daily Prophet", ") has turned Harry's tragic and heroic encounter with Voldemort at the Triwizard Tournament into an excuse to ridicule and discount the teen.

Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry's certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry's confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry's gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician's struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore's very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry.

Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season's premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder.", "  Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians' schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests. Could Harry be one of the lucky contenders? ", "  But Quidditch buffs need not go into mourning: we get our share of this great game at the World Cup. Attempting to go incognito as Muggles, 100,000 witches and wizards converge on a \"nice deserted moor.\" As ever, Rowling magicks up the details that make her world so vivid, and so comic. Several spectators' tents, for instance, are entirely unquotidian. One is a minipalace, complete with live peacocks; another has three floors and multiple turrets. And the sports paraphernalia on offer includes rosettes \"squealing the names of the players\" as well as \"tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves.\" Needless to say, the two teams are decidedly different, down to their mascots. Bulgaria is supported by the beautiful veela, who instantly enchant everyone--including Ireland's supporters--over to their side. Until, that is, thousands of tiny cheerleaders engage in some pyrotechnics of their own: \"The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field.\"", "  Long before her fourth installment appeared, Rowling warned that it would be darker, and it's true that every exhilaration is equaled by a moment that has us fearing for Harry's life, the book's emotions running as deep as its dangers. Along the way, though, she conjures up such new characters as Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, a Dark Wizard catcher who may or may not be getting paranoid in his old age, and Rita Skeeter, who beetles around Hogwarts in search of stories. (This ", "Daily Prophet", " scoop artist has a Quick-Quotes Quill that turns even the most innocent assertion into tabloid innuendo.) And at her bedazzling close, Rowling leaves several plot strands open, awaiting book 5. This fan is ready to wager that the author herself is part veela--her pen her wand, her commitment to her world complete.

Moving through time loops, they meet a menagerie of characters who help them along the way, but danger lurks at every corner, and horrors are not far behind. Even if the teens reach London alive, will it be enough to save Miss Peregrine from an ornithological fate? This book is perfectly paced, suspenseful, and scary. It is dark and dreadful but also humorous and touching. The peculiars are intriguing, each with fascinating powers, such as invisibility or premonition. They play off of one another's strengths and weaknesses, which progresses the story and further develops the characters. And of course there is the book's main attraction: the found vernacular photography, vintage pictures that Riggs has collected from flea markets and archives. The quirky and creepy snapshots perfectly illustrate the characters and settings, reinforcing the dark atmosphere of the narrative. New readers of the series will find this novel a treat and will be able to sift through summaries of previous events to place themselves in the story.

Grief, terror, love, longing--these were intangibles, but the intangibles had their own mass and specific gravity, they had tangible weight. They carried shameful memories. They carried the common secret of cowardice.... Men killed, and died, because they were embarrassed not to.\"", "  A finalist for both the 1990 Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award, ", "The Things They Carried", " marks a subtle but definitive line of demarcation between Tim O'Brien's earlier works about Vietnam, the memoir ", "If I Die in a Combat  Zone", " and the fictional  ", "Going After Cacciato", ", and this sly, almost hallucinatory book that is neither memoir nor novel nor collection of short stories but rather an artful combination of all three. Vietnam is still O'Brien's theme, but in this book he seems less interested in the war itself than in the myriad different perspectives from which he depicts it. Whereas ", "Going After Cacciato", " played with reality, ", "The Things They Carried", " plays with truth. The narrator of most of these stories is \"Tim\"; yet O'Brien freely admits that many of the events he chronicles in this collection never really happened. He never killed a man as \"Tim\" does in \"The Man I Killed,\" and unlike Tim in \"Ambush,\" he has no daughter named Kathleen. But just because a thing never happened doesn't make it any less true. In \"On the Rainy River,\" the character Tim O'Brien responds to his draft notice by driving north, to the Canadian border where he spends six days in a deserted lodge in the company of an old man named Elroy while he wrestles with the choice between dodging the draft or going to war. The real Tim O'Brien never drove north, never found himself in a fishing boat 20 yards off the Canadian shore with a decision to make. The real Tim O'Brien quietly boarded the bus to Sioux Falls and was inducted into the United States Army. But the truth of \"On the Rainy River\" lies not in facts but in the genuineness of the experience it depicts: both Tims went to a war they didn't believe in; both considered themselves cowards for doing so. Every story in ", "The Things They Carried", " speaks another truth that Tim O'Brien learned in Vietnam; it is this blurred line between truth and reality, fact and fiction, that makes his book unforgettable.

The haunting story centers on twelve-year-old Jonas, who lives in a seemingly ideal, if colorless, world of conformity and contentment. Not until he is given his life assignment as the Receiver of Memory does he begin to understand the dark, complex secrets behind his fragile community. Lois Lowry has written three companion novels to ", "The Giver, ", "including ", "Gathering Blue, Messenger,", " and ", "Son.", " Sponsored Products are advertisements for products sold by merchants on Amazon.com.

", " ", "In a world with no poverty, no crime, no sickness and no unemployment, and where every family is happy, 12-year-old Jonas is chosen to be the community's Receiver of Memories. Under the tutelage of the Elders and an old man known as the Giver, he discovers the disturbing truth about his utopian world and struggles against the weight of its hypocrisy. With echoes of ", "Brave New World", ", in this 1994 ", "Newbery Medal", " winner, Lowry examines the idea that people might freely choose to give up their humanity in order to create a more stable society. Gradually Jonas learns just how costly this ordered and pain-free society can be, and boldly decides he cannot pay the price.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t--This text refers to the ", "Hardcover", " edition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "In the \"ideal\" world into which Jonas was born, everybody has sensibly agreed that well-matched married couples will raise exactly two offspring, one boy and one girl. These children's adolescent sexual impulses will be stifled with specially prescribed drugs; at age 12 they will receive an appropriate career assignment, sensibly chosen by the community's Elders. This is a world in which the old live in group homes and are \"released\"--to great celebration--at the proper time; the few infants who do not develop according to schedule are also \"released,\" but with no fanfare. Lowry's development of this civilization is so deft that her readers, like the community's citizens, will be easily seduced by the chimera of this ordered, pain-free society. Until the time that Jonah begins training for his job assignment--the rigorous and prestigious position of Receiver of Memory--he, too, is a complacent model citizen. But as his near-mystical training progresses, and he is weighed down and enriched with society's collective memories of a world as stimulating as it was flawed, Jonas grows increasingly aware of the hypocrisy that rules his world. With a storyline that hints at Christian allegory and an eerie futuristic setting, this intriguing novel calls to mind John Christopher's Tripods trilogy and Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Match Girl. Lowry is once again in top form--raising many questions while answering few, and unwinding a tale fit for the most adventurous readers. Ages 12-14.

He has little time to realize how alone he is, because he is so busy just trying to survive. And learning to survive, to plan on food not just for a day but untiland ifhe is rescued, only begins when he stops pitying himself and understands that no one can help him. He is on his own, without his divorced father, whom he was to visit, or his mother, whom Brian saw kissing another man before the divorce. This is a heart-stopping story: it seems that at every moment Brian is forced to face a life-and-death decision, and every page makes readers wonder at the density of descriptive detail Paulsen has expertly woven together. Poetic texture and realistic events are combined to create something beyond adventure, a book that plunges readers into the cleft of the protagonist's experience. Ages 11-13. ", "Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t--This text refers to the ", "Library Binding", " edition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "Grade 8-12 Brian Robeson, 13, is the only passenger on a small plane flying him to visit his father in the Canadian wilderness when the pilot has a heart attack and dies. The plane drifts off course and finally crashes into a small lake. Miraculously Brian is able to swim free of the plane, arriving on a sandy tree-lined shore with only his clothing, a tattered windbreaker, and the hatchet his mother had given him as a present. The novel chronicles in gritty detail Brian's mistakes, setbacks, and small triumphs as, with the help of the hatchet, he manages to survive the 54 days alone in the wilderness. Paulsen effectively shows readers how Brian learns patienceto watch, listen, and think before he actsas he attempts to build a fire, to fish and hunt, and to make his home under a rock overhang safe and comfortable. An epilogue discussing the lasting effects of Brian's stay in the wilderness and his dim chance of survival had winter come upon him before rescue adds credibility to the story. Paulsen tells a fine adventure story, but the sub-plot concerning Brian's preoccupation with his parents' divorce seems a bit forced and detracts from the book.

Only, it is not the end for Sam. She wakes up to start the same day over again, and again; in fact, she relives it seven times.

It is difficult to feel pity for Sam; she is snobbish, obnoxious, a cheater, and just plain mean. However, her gradual and complete transformation is so convincing that when she finally puts others before herself in order to save another life, it is moving and cathartic.

For centuries they have practiced techniques that allow them to run hundreds of miles without rest and chase down anything from a deer to an Olympic marathoner while enjoying every mile of it. Their superhuman talent is matched by uncanny health and serenity, leaving the Tarahumara immune to the diseases and strife that plague modern existence. With the help of Caballo Blanco, a mysterious loner who lives among the tribe, the author was able not only to uncover the secrets of the Tarahumara but also to find his own inner ultra-athlete, as he trained for the challenge of a lifetime: a fifty-mile race through the heart of Tarahumara country pitting the tribe against an odd band of Americans, including a star ultramarathoner, a beautiful young surfer, and a barefoot wonder.", "With a sharp wit and wild exuberance, McDougall takes us from the high-tech science labs at Harvard to the sun-baked valleys and freezing peaks across North America, where ever-growing numbers of ultrarunners are pushing their bodies to the limit, and, finally, to the climactic race in the Copper Canyons.

What are some of the secrets you learned from them?", "Christopher McDougall:", " The key secret hit me like a thunderbolt. It was so simple, yet such a jolt. It was this: everything I\u2019d been taught about running was wrong. We treat running in the modern world the same way we treat childbirth\u2014it\u2019s going to hurt, and requires special exercises and equipment, and the best you can hope for is to get it over with quickly with minimal damage.", "Then I meet the Tarahumara, and they\u2019re having a blast. They remember what it\u2019s like to love running, and it lets them blaze through the canyons like dolphins rocketing through waves. For them, running isn\u2019t work. It isn\u2019t a punishment for eating. It\u2019s fine art, like it was for our ancestors. Way before we were scratching pictures on caves or beating rhythms on hollow trees, we were perfecting the art of combining our breath and mind and muscles into fluid self-propulsion over wild terrain. And when our ancestors finally did make their first cave paintings, what were the first designs? A downward slash, lightning bolts through the bottom and middle\u2014behold, the Running Man.", "The Tarahumara have a saying: \u201cChildren run before they can walk.\u201d Watch any four-year-old\u2014they do everything at full speed, and it\u2019s all about fun. That\u2019s the most important thing I picked up from my time in the Copper Canyons, the understanding that running can be fast and fun and spontaneous, and when it is, you feel like you can go forever. But all of that begins with your feet. Strange as it sounds, the Tarahumara taught me to change my relationship with the ground. Instead of hammering down on my heels, the way I\u2019d been taught all my life, I learned to run lightly and gently on the balls of my feet. The day I mastered it was the last day I was ever injured. ", "Q:", " You trained for your first ultramarathon\u2014a race organized by the mysterious gringo expat Caballo Blanco between the Tarahumara and some of America\u2019s top ultrarunners\u2014while researching and writing this book. What was your training like?", "CM:", " It really started as kind of a dare. Just by chance, I\u2019d met an adventure-sports coach from Jackson Hole, Wyoming named Eric Orton. Eric\u2019s specialty is tearing endurance sports down to their basic components and looking for transferable skills. He studies rock climbing to find shoulder techniques for kayakers, and applies Nordic skiing\u2019s smooth propulsion to mountain biking. What he\u2019s looking for are basic engineering principles, because he\u2019s convinced that the next big leap forward in fitness won\u2019t come from strength or technology, but plain, simple durability. With some 70% of all runners getting hurt every year, the athlete who can stay healthy and avoid injury will leave the competition behind.", "So naturally, Eric idolized the Tarahumara. Any tribe that has 90-year-old men running across mountaintops obviously has a few training tips up its sleeve. But since Eric had never actually met the Tarahumara, he had to deduce their methods by pure reasoning. His starting point was uncertainty; he assumed that the Tarahumara step into the unknown every time they leave their caves, because they never know how fast they\u2019ll have to sprint after a rabbit or how tricky the climbing will be if they\u2019re caught in a storm. They never even know how long a race will be until they step up to the starting line\u2014the distance is only determined in a last-minute bout of negotiating and could stretch anywhere from 50 miles to 200-plus.", "Eric figured shock and awe was the best way for me to build durability and mimic Tarahumara-style running. He\u2019d throw something new at me every day\u2014hopping drills, lunges, mile intervals\u2014and lots and lots of hills. There was no such thing, really, as long, slow distance\u2014he\u2019d have me mix lots of hill repeats and short bursts of speed into every mega-long run.", "I didn\u2019t think I could do it without breaking down, and I told Eric that from the start. I basically defied him to turn me into a runner. And by the end of nine months, I was cranking out four hour runs without a problem.", "Q:", " You\u2019re a six-foot four-inches tall, 200-plus pound guy\u2014not anyone\u2019s typical vision of a distance runner, yet you\u2019ve completed ultra marathons and are training for more. Is there a body type for running, as many of us assume, or are all humans built to run?", "CM:", " Yeah, I\u2019m a big\u2019un. But isn\u2019t it sad that\u2019s even a reasonable question? I bought into that bull for a loooong time. Why wouldn\u2019t I? I was constantly being told by people who should know better that \u201csome bodies aren\u2019t designed for running.\u201d One of the best sports medicine physicians in the country told me exactly that\u2014that the reason I was constantly getting hurt is because I was too big to handle the impact shock from my feet hitting the ground. Just recently, I interviewed a nationally-known sports podiatrist who said, \u201cYou know, we didn\u2019t ALL evolve to run away from saber-toothed tigers.\u201d Meaning, what? That anyone who isn\u2019t sleek as a Kenyan marathoner should be extinct? It\u2019s such illogical blather\u2014all kinds of body types exist today, so obviously they DID evolve to move quickly on their feet. It\u2019s really awful that so many doctors are reinforcing this learned helplessness, this idea that you have to be some kind of elite being to handle such a basic, universal movement. ", "Q:", " If humans are born to run, as you argue, what\u2019s your advice for a runner who is looking to make the leap from shorter road races to marathons, or marathons to ultramarathons? Is running really for everyone?", "CM:", " I think ultrarunning is America\u2019s hope for the future. Honestly. The ultrarunners have got a hold of some powerful wisdom. You can see it at the starting line of any ultra race. I showed up at the Leadville Trail 100 expecting to see a bunch of hollow-eyed Skeletors, and instead it was, \u201cWhoah! Get a load of the hotties!\u201d Ultra runners tend to be amazingly healthy, youthful and\u2014believe it or not\u2014good looking. I couldn\u2019t figure out why, until one runner explained that throughout history, the four basic ingredients for optimal health have been clean air, good food, fresh water and low stress. And that, to a T, describes the daily life of an ultrarunner. They\u2019re out in the woods for hours at a time, breathing pine-scented breezes, eating small bursts of digestible food, downing water by the gallons, and feeling their stress melt away with the miles. But here\u2019s the real key to that kingdom: you have to relax and enjoy the run. No one cares how fast you run 50 miles, so ultrarunners don\u2019t really stress about times. They\u2019re out to enjoy the run and finish strong, not shave a few inconsequential seconds off a personal best. And that\u2019s the best way to transition up to big mileage races: as coach Eric told me, \u201cIf it feels like work, you\u2019re working too hard.\u201d ", "Q:", " You write that distance running is the great equalizer of age and gender. Can you explain?", "CM:", " Okay, I\u2019ll answer that question with a question: Starting at age nineteen, runners get faster every year until they hit their peak at twenty-seven. After twenty-seven, they start to decline. So if it takes you eight years to reach your peak, how many years does it take for you to regress back to the same speed you were running at nineteen?", "Go ahead, guess all you want. No one I\u2019ve asked has ever come close. It\u2019s in the book, so I won\u2019t give it away, but I guarantee when you hear the answer, you\u2019ll say, \u201cNo way. THAT old?\u201d Now, factor in this: ultra races are the only sport in the world in which women can go toe-to-toe with men and hand them their heads. Ann Trason and Krissy Moehl often beat every man in the field in some ultraraces, while Emily Baer recently finished in the Top 10 at the Hardrock 100 while stopping to breastfeed her baby at the water stations.", "So how\u2019s that possible? According to a new body of research, it\u2019s because humans are the greatest distance runners on earth. We may not be fast, but we\u2019re born with such remarkable natural endurance that humans are fully capable of outrunning horses, cheetahs and antelopes. That\u2019s because we once hunted in packs and on foot; all of us, men and women alike, young and old together. ", "Q:", " One of the fascinating parts of ", "Born to Run", " is your report on how the ultrarunners eat\u2014salad for breakfast, wraps with hummus mid-run, or pizza and beer the night before a run. As a runner with a lot of miles behind him, what are your thoughts on nutrition for running?", "CM:", "  Live every day like you\u2019re on the lam. If you\u2019ve got to be ready to pick up and haul butt at a moment\u2019s notice, you\u2019re not going to be loading up on gut-busting meals. I thought I\u2019d have to go on some kind of prison-camp diet to get ready for an ultra, but the best advice I got came from coach Eric, who told me to just worry about the running and the eating would take care of itself. And he was right, sort of. I instinctively began eating smaller, more digestible meals as my miles increased, but then I went behind his back and consulted with the great Dr. Ruth Heidrich, an Ironman triathlete who lives on a vegan diet. She\u2019s the one who gave me the idea of having salad for breakfast, and it\u2019s a fantastic tip. The truth is, many of the greatest endurance athletes of all time lived on fruits and vegetables. You can get away with garbage for a while, but you pay for it in the long haul. In the book, I describe how Jenn Shelton and Billy \u201cBonehead\u201d Barnett like to chow pizza and Mountain Dew in the middle of 100-mile races, but Jenn is also a vegetarian who most days lives on veggie burgers and grapes. ", "Q:", " In this difficult financial time, we\u2019re experiencing yet another surge in the popularity of running. Can you explain this?", "CM:", " When things look worst, we run the most. Three times, America has seen distance-running skyrocket and it\u2019s always in the midst of a national crisis. The first boom came during the Great Depression; the next was in the \u201870s, when we were struggling to recover from a recession, race riots, assassinations, a criminal President and an awful war. And the third boom? One year after the Sept. 11 attacks, trailrunning suddenly became the fastest-growing outdoor sport in the country. I think there\u2019s a trigger in the human psyche that activates our first and greatest survival skill whenever we see the shadow of approaching raptors.", " (Photo \u00a9 James Rexroad)  ", "From the depths of Mexico\u2019s Copper Canyon to the heights of the Leadville Trail 100 ultramarathon in Colorado, from the centuries-old running techniques of Mexico\u2019s Tarahumara tribe to a research lab at the University of Utah, author McDougall celebrates, in this engaging and picaresque account, humankind\u2019s innate love of running.

It captures the moments of joy and terror Finnegan\u2019s lifelong passion has brought him, as well as his occasional ambivalence about the tenacious hold it has on him.

Still, Finnegan considerately shows himself paying the price of admission in a few near drownings, and these are among the most electrifying moments in the book\u2026There are too many breathtaking, original things in Barbarian Days to do more than mention here\u2014observations about surfing that have simply never been made before, or certainly never so well.\u201d", " \u2014The New York Times Book Review\u00a0", " ", " \u201cWithout a doubt, the finest surf book I\u2019ve ever read\u2026 All this technical mastery and precise description goes hand in hand with an unabashed, infectious earnestness.\u00a0Finnegan has certainly written a surfing book for surfers, but on a more fundamental level, \u2018Barbarian Days\u2019 offers a cleareyed vision of American boyhood. Like Jon Krakauer\u2019s \u2018Into the Wild,\u2019 it is a sympathetic examination of what happens when literary ideas of freedom and purity take hold of a young mind and fling his body out into the far reaches of the world.\u201d", " \u2014The New York Times Magazine", " \u00a0", " \u201cWhich is precisely what makes the propulsive precision of Finnegan\u2019s writing so surprising and revelatory\u2026 Finnegan\u2019s treatment of surfing never feels like performance. Through the sheer intensity of his descriptive powers and the undeniable ways in which surfing has shaped his life, Barbarian Days is an utterly convincing study in the joy of treating seriously an unserious thing\u2026As Finnegan demonstrates, surfing, like good writing, is an act of vigilant noticing. \u201d\u00a0", " \u2014The New York Review of Books\u00a0", " ", " \u201cFinnegan is an excellent surfer; at some point he became an even better writer.

Were I given unlimited space to review this book, I would simply reproduce it here, with a quotation mark at the beginning and another at the end. While surfers have a reputation for being inarticulate, there is actually a fair amount of overlap between what makes a good surfer and a good writer. A smooth style, an ability to stay close to the source of the energy, humility before the task, and, once you\u2019re done, not claiming your ride. In other words, making something exceedingly difficult look easy. The gift for writing a clean line is rare, and the gift for riding one even rarer.
