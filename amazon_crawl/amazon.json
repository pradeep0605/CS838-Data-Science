Paris in the '20s! Hemingway and his first wife, Hadley, lived happily on $5 a day and still had money for drinks at the Closerie des Lilas, skiing in the Alps, and fishing trips to Spain. On every corner and at every caf\u00e9 table, there were the most extraordinary people living wonderful lives and telling fantastic stories.  ", "Gertrude Stein", " invited Hemingway to come every afternoon and sip \"fragrant, colorless alcohols\" and chat admid her great pictures. He taught  ", "Ezra Pound", " how to box, gossiped with  ", "James Joyce", ", caroused with the fatally insecure  ", "Scott Fitzgerald", " (the acid portraits of him and his wife,  ", "Zelda", ", are notorious). Meanwhile, Hemingway invented a new way of writing based on this simple premise: \"All you have to do is write one true sentence.

", " ", "\"A New Look at Cuba\" by Rachel Lee Harris You ve booked a flight from Miami and have your approved travel visa in hand. You re ready to see Cuba. Now what? Cue Stephan VanDam, a cartographer, graphic designer and president of the map company that bears his name. Though practical, his witty, origami-like physical maps and sleek 4-D interactive digital maps can also carve a historic or cultural path through a city (like his History Mapped presidential series). The company has now turned its attention to Cuba. Using his signature StreetSmart series design for printed maps (Internet connections are still scant in Cuba), Mr. VanDam points out Havana s restaurants, hotels, resorts and the home-based restaurants known as paladares and offers five self-guided tours that wind through the city s many plazas to contemporary galleries, music venues and gardens, along the Malec\u00f3n coastal road and as far as the beaches of Playas de Este. As an amateur mambo dancer and Latin Jazz aficionado, Mr. VanDam has always had a fascination with Cuba and its connection to the Latin jazz scene in New York, he said on the phone from his office there. Musically, it's a world power. I remember my parents doing the mambo in the 1950s and their parents in the 30s. So the maps focus a lot on those aspects of Cuba s culture. It s also a treasure trove of architecture, he said. Cuba is totally cohesive in its urban fabric since there was no money after the revolution to replace buildings with modern structures. The company also has produced StreetSmart Cuba, which maps out the network of Spanish Colonial towns and Unesco World Heritage sites on country roads from west to east, and guides travelers through beach towns along the shores both north and south. The Havana map is $8.95, the Cuba map $9.95 --The New York Times, Travel", "\"In Cuba, Maps Make a Comeback\" by Steve Heller Old-fashioned navigation is enjoying a renaissance on the island, where Internet access is still scant. When Stephan Van Dam began designing two detailed tourist maps of Cuba in 2014, he couldn t have known that one year later, the prospect of renewed relations between the country and the U.S. could effectively create a whole new market for them. At the time Van Dam, the founder of VanDam s StreetSmart maps, was catering to a smaller audience: the Americans who could only visit the country if they were Cuban-American or embarking on a people-to-people tour run by a licensed guide, and the 1.1 million Canadians and hundreds of thousands of European travelers who visited last year. In 2015, the country offers jaded American travelers something different from the usual tourist trappings. According to Van Dam, the country is experiencing a brief moment free of advertising before global corporate luxe flattens the island. With highly legible cartography and engaging photographic covers, his StreetSmart Cuba and StreetSmart Havana maps highlight local business colorfully. They're guides to the latest hotels, resorts, restaurants and paladares (private family-run restaurants) that appeal to the pioneering tourist eager to experience the country before the inevitable onslaught of development. Van Dam s Cuban maps culled their information from both federal data and his team s personal experience. The relief and terrain data come courtesy of the CIA; the cultural and urban information was provided by Havana s Office of the City Historian; the restaurant and paladares recommendations from his team s ground trothing and testing, as well as recommendations by Cubans and American friends. Walking Havana from one end to the other gave Van Dam a sense of the urban fabric, which is, by his description, frozen in time and brimming with period-specific architectural jewels buildings that reflect Plateresque, Cuban baroque, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Streamline Moderne, Mid-century modern, and Soviet Brutalist architectures. Cuba, he says, \"avoided the 1960s Corbusian redevelopment schemes that destroyed so many world cities throughout the Americas.\" To develop the maps, Van Dam and his team visited Cuba in 2013 under a U.S. self-certification program administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control that permits U.S. citizens to travel to Cuba independently to conduct research. With the prospect of sanctions being lifted in the near future, Van Dam is already planning more Cuba projects across new media, starting with a website mapping the influence of the clave, an instrument that figures widely in Cuban music, around the world. The paper map may be old-fashioned, but when it comes to Cuba, Van Dam is ahead of the curve. Havana is currently a dark spot on Google Street Maps, and Google hasn't yet released a statement saying when the company will upgrade its coverage. Even if Street Maps did work there, though, there are no guarantees it would have very many users in the near future. With Internet coverage at a scant 5 percent across the country and download speeds reminiscent of the pre-dial-up era, Cuba doesn t yet have the digital infrastructure to support cell phone cartography. Which leaves room for a handy paper copy renaissance: This is a fleeting moment, Van Damm notes, when the trusty laminated map trumps Google views. --The Atlantic Magazine", "Top 10 what to take to Cuba 1_USB Flash Drives 2_Kleenex 3_VanDam Havana StreetSmart Maps.

In 11 short chapters that follow the same structure, Potts tells how to negotiate time off from work, prepare for travel, and get the most out of your time on the road. Each chapter contains a profile of a famous proponent of vagabonding (e.g., Thoreau, Annie Dillard), quotes from everyday people with extensive travel experience, and a tip sheet of print and online sources for practical travel advice on topics such as airline tickets and accommodations as well as safety concerns. Alternately warning readers about using drugs in foreign countries and entertaining them with anecdotes from exotic ports of call, Potts gives a thorough recounting of his outlook on traveling. This book seems squarely aimed at twenty- and thirtysomethings; anyone with decidedly nonvagabond accoutrements (e.g., children or career ambition) might be more skeptical of Potts' philosophy.

Their superhuman talent is matched by uncanny health and serenity, leaving the Tarahumara immune to the diseases and strife that plague modern existence. With the help of Caballo Blanco, a mysterious loner who lives among the tribe, the author was able not only to uncover the secrets of the Tarahumara but also to find his own inner ultra-athlete, as he trained for the challenge of a lifetime: a fifty-mile race through the heart of Tarahumara country pitting the tribe against an odd band of Americans, including a star ultramarathoner, a beautiful young surfer, and a barefoot wonder.", "With a sharp wit and wild exuberance, McDougall takes us from the high-tech science labs at Harvard to the sun-baked valleys and freezing peaks across North America, where ever-growing numbers of ultrarunners are pushing their bodies to the limit, and, finally, to the climactic race in the Copper Canyons.

They recently founded the Faber Piano Institute in Ann Arbor, MI, where they live with their daughter Vivian. Nancy Faber, who was named \"Distinguished Composer of the Year\" by the Music Teachers National Association, enjoys a busy schedule of commissions for the concert stage in addition to her educational composing. Recent commissions include \"The Snow Queen\" for narrator and orchestra, \"The Picture My Imagination Has Painted\" for Flute Quartet and Piano, and \"Trio for Flute, Saxophone and Piano\". Her pieces have been heard on U.S. public radio and network television. She studied composition with Joan Tower, William Albright, and British composer Nicholas Maw; piano studies were at the Eastman School and Michigan State University. Randall Faber has toured Korea, Taiwan, Canada and the United Kingdom. He was master teacher for both the World Conference on Piano Pedagogy and the National Conference on Keyboard Pedagogy. He gave recitals in St. Louis, Ann Arbor, as Convention Artist for the North Dakota Music Teachers, and performed as Visiting Artist at the University of Michigan, University of Southern Mississippi, Saginaw State University, and numerous universities throughout South Korea. He was featured clinician for the Nebraska Music Teachers, the Florida Music Teachers and the Pennsylvania Music Teachers Convention, and recently presented his research at the 9th International Conference on Motivation in Lisbon, Portugal. Dr. Faber holds three degrees from the University of Michigan and a Ph.D. from Vanderbilt University. The Fabers advocate piano study not only for personal expression and performance success, but also as a vehicle for the student's creative and cognitive development.

The Independent 'A hugely enjoyable romp through the pleasures and pitfalls of setting up home in a foreign land' -- PD Smith Guardian 'A wryly amusing account of a new life in a strange land.' Choice Magazine 'if you can't up sticks and move to Denmark... don't despair: here are a few tips and tricks I've picked up for getting a slice of the Danish work-life balance wherever you are.' 'Russell's husband takes a contract with Lego and they are catapulted into rural Jutland, in Denmark. Russell, who is a fast living journalist in London, is at first overwhelmed with the silence, the people, the sheer differences of living in a very foreign country. She then discovers that Danish people have the highest-rated happiness scores in the world... what's their secret? Why are they so damn happy? I'll let you know, it's a lot to do with something called \"Hygge\".' 'Giving up isn't always a bad thing; being a dropout can even change your life for the better. Helen Russell was a high-flying glossy magazine editor before moving to rural Jutland in Denmark which, despite its long dark winters, is also statistically the happiest nation on earth.

His descriptions of some of the world\u2019s most powerful and unforgiving waves are hauntingly beautiful\u2026Finnegan displays an honesty that is evident throughout the book, parts of which have a searing, unvarnished intensity that reminded me of \u2018Stop Time,\u2019 the classic coming-of-age memoir by Frank Conroy.\u201d", " \u2014Washington Post\u00a0", " \u00a0", " \u201cThe kind of book that makes you squirm in your seat on the subway, gaze out the window at work, and Google Map the quickest route to the beach.

It captures the moments of joy and terror Finnegan\u2019s lifelong passion has brought him, as well as his occasional ambivalence about the tenacious hold it has on him.

And it is cause for throwing your wet-suit hoods in the air\u2026If the book has a flaw, it lies in the envy helplessly induced in the armchair surf-\u00adtraveler by so many lusty affairs with waves that are the supermodels of the surf world. Still, Finnegan considerately shows himself paying the price of admission in a few near drownings, and these are among the most electrifying moments in the book\u2026There are too many breathtaking, original things in Barbarian Days to do more than mention here\u2014observations about surfing that have simply never been made before, or certainly never so well.\u201d", " \u2014The New York Times Book Review\u00a0", " ", " \u201cWithout a doubt, the finest surf book I\u2019ve ever read\u2026 All this technical mastery and precise description goes hand in hand with an unabashed, infectious earnestness.\u00a0Finnegan has certainly written a surfing book for surfers, but on a more fundamental level, \u2018Barbarian Days\u2019 offers a cleareyed vision of American boyhood. Like Jon Krakauer\u2019s \u2018Into the Wild,\u2019 it is a sympathetic examination of what happens when literary ideas of freedom and purity take hold of a young mind and fling his body out into the far reaches of the world.\u201d", " \u2014The New York Times Magazine", " \u00a0", " \u201cWhich is precisely what makes the propulsive precision of Finnegan\u2019s writing so surprising and revelatory\u2026 Finnegan\u2019s treatment of surfing never feels like performance. Through the sheer intensity of his descriptive powers and the undeniable ways in which surfing has shaped his life, Barbarian Days is an utterly convincing study in the joy of treating seriously an unserious thing\u2026As Finnegan demonstrates, surfing, like good writing, is an act of vigilant noticing. \u201d\u00a0", " \u2014The New York Review of Books\u00a0", " ", " \u201cFinnegan is an excellent surfer; at some point he became an even better writer.

But also because while it is a book about \u2018A Surfing Life\u2019\u2026it\u2019s also about a writer\u2019s life and, even more generally, a quester\u2019s life, more carefully observed and precisely rendered than any I\u2019ve read in a long time.\u201d", " \u2014Los Angeles Times", " ", " \u201cGorgeously written and intensely felt\u2026With Mr. Finnegan\u2019s bravura memoir, the surfing bookshelf is dramatically enriched.

Non-surfers, too, will be treated to a travelogue head-scratchingly rich in obscure, sharply observed destinations\u2026Dare I say that we all need Mr. Finnegan\u2026as a role model for a life fully, thrillingly, lived.\u201d", " \u2014Wall Street Journal", " ", " \u201cAn evocative, profound and deeply moving memoir\u2026The proof is in the sentences. Were I given unlimited space to review this book, I would simply reproduce it here, with a quotation mark at the beginning and another at the end. While surfers have a reputation for being inarticulate, there is actually a fair amount of overlap between what makes a good surfer and a good writer. A smooth style, an ability to stay close to the source of the energy, humility before the task, and, once you\u2019re done, not claiming your ride.

Awed by merely the camping section of his local sporting goods store, he nevertheless plunges into the wilderness and emerges with a consistently comical account of a neophyte woodsman learning hard lessons about self-reliance. Bryson (The Lost Continent) carries himself in an irresistibly bewildered manner, accepting each new calamity with wonder and hilarity. He reviews the characters of the AT (as the trail is called), from a pack of incompetent Boy Scouts to a perpetually lost geezer named Chicken John. Most amusing is his cranky, crude and inestimable companion, Katz, a reformed substance abuser who once had single-handedly \"become, in effect, Iowa's drug culture.\" The uneasy but always entertaining relationship between Bryson and Katz keeps their walk interesting, even during the flat stretches. Bryson completes the trail as planned, and he records the misadventure with insight and elegance. He is a popular author in Britain and his impeccably graceful and witty style deserves a large American audience as well.

For centuries they have practiced techniques that allow them to run hundreds of miles without rest and chase down anything from a deer to an Olympic marathoner while enjoying every mile of it. Their superhuman talent is matched by uncanny health and serenity, leaving the Tarahumara immune to the diseases and strife that plague modern existence. With the help of Caballo Blanco, a mysterious loner who lives among the tribe, the author was able not only to uncover the secrets of the Tarahumara but also to find his own inner ultra-athlete, as he trained for the challenge of a lifetime: a fifty-mile race through the heart of Tarahumara country pitting the tribe against an odd band of Americans, including a star ultramarathoner, a beautiful young surfer, and a barefoot wonder.", "With a sharp wit and wild exuberance, McDougall takes us from the high-tech science labs at Harvard to the sun-baked valleys and freezing peaks across North America, where ever-growing numbers of ultrarunners are pushing their bodies to the limit, and, finally, to the climactic race in the Copper Canyons.

What are some of the secrets you learned from them?", "Christopher McDougall:", " The key secret hit me like a thunderbolt. It was so simple, yet such a jolt. It was this: everything I\u2019d been taught about running was wrong. We treat running in the modern world the same way we treat childbirth\u2014it\u2019s going to hurt, and requires special exercises and equipment, and the best you can hope for is to get it over with quickly with minimal damage.", "Then I meet the Tarahumara, and they\u2019re having a blast. They remember what it\u2019s like to love running, and it lets them blaze through the canyons like dolphins rocketing through waves. For them, running isn\u2019t work. It isn\u2019t a punishment for eating. It\u2019s fine art, like it was for our ancestors. Way before we were scratching pictures on caves or beating rhythms on hollow trees, we were perfecting the art of combining our breath and mind and muscles into fluid self-propulsion over wild terrain. And when our ancestors finally did make their first cave paintings, what were the first designs? A downward slash, lightning bolts through the bottom and middle\u2014behold, the Running Man.", "The Tarahumara have a saying: \u201cChildren run before they can walk.\u201d Watch any four-year-old\u2014they do everything at full speed, and it\u2019s all about fun. That\u2019s the most important thing I picked up from my time in the Copper Canyons, the understanding that running can be fast and fun and spontaneous, and when it is, you feel like you can go forever. But all of that begins with your feet. Strange as it sounds, the Tarahumara taught me to change my relationship with the ground. Instead of hammering down on my heels, the way I\u2019d been taught all my life, I learned to run lightly and gently on the balls of my feet. The day I mastered it was the last day I was ever injured. ", "Q:", " You trained for your first ultramarathon\u2014a race organized by the mysterious gringo expat Caballo Blanco between the Tarahumara and some of America\u2019s top ultrarunners\u2014while researching and writing this book. What was your training like?", "CM:", " It really started as kind of a dare. Just by chance, I\u2019d met an adventure-sports coach from Jackson Hole, Wyoming named Eric Orton. Eric\u2019s specialty is tearing endurance sports down to their basic components and looking for transferable skills. He studies rock climbing to find shoulder techniques for kayakers, and applies Nordic skiing\u2019s smooth propulsion to mountain biking. What he\u2019s looking for are basic engineering principles, because he\u2019s convinced that the next big leap forward in fitness won\u2019t come from strength or technology, but plain, simple durability. With some 70% of all runners getting hurt every year, the athlete who can stay healthy and avoid injury will leave the competition behind.", "So naturally, Eric idolized the Tarahumara. Any tribe that has 90-year-old men running across mountaintops obviously has a few training tips up its sleeve. But since Eric had never actually met the Tarahumara, he had to deduce their methods by pure reasoning. His starting point was uncertainty; he assumed that the Tarahumara step into the unknown every time they leave their caves, because they never know how fast they\u2019ll have to sprint after a rabbit or how tricky the climbing will be if they\u2019re caught in a storm. They never even know how long a race will be until they step up to the starting line\u2014the distance is only determined in a last-minute bout of negotiating and could stretch anywhere from 50 miles to 200-plus.", "Eric figured shock and awe was the best way for me to build durability and mimic Tarahumara-style running. He\u2019d throw something new at me every day\u2014hopping drills, lunges, mile intervals\u2014and lots and lots of hills. There was no such thing, really, as long, slow distance\u2014he\u2019d have me mix lots of hill repeats and short bursts of speed into every mega-long run.", "I didn\u2019t think I could do it without breaking down, and I told Eric that from the start. I basically defied him to turn me into a runner. And by the end of nine months, I was cranking out four hour runs without a problem.", "Q:", " You\u2019re a six-foot four-inches tall, 200-plus pound guy\u2014not anyone\u2019s typical vision of a distance runner, yet you\u2019ve completed ultra marathons and are training for more. Is there a body type for running, as many of us assume, or are all humans built to run?", "CM:", " Yeah, I\u2019m a big\u2019un. But isn\u2019t it sad that\u2019s even a reasonable question? I bought into that bull for a loooong time. Why wouldn\u2019t I? I was constantly being told by people who should know better that \u201csome bodies aren\u2019t designed for running.\u201d One of the best sports medicine physicians in the country told me exactly that\u2014that the reason I was constantly getting hurt is because I was too big to handle the impact shock from my feet hitting the ground. Just recently, I interviewed a nationally-known sports podiatrist who said, \u201cYou know, we didn\u2019t ALL evolve to run away from saber-toothed tigers.\u201d Meaning, what? That anyone who isn\u2019t sleek as a Kenyan marathoner should be extinct? It\u2019s such illogical blather\u2014all kinds of body types exist today, so obviously they DID evolve to move quickly on their feet. It\u2019s really awful that so many doctors are reinforcing this learned helplessness, this idea that you have to be some kind of elite being to handle such a basic, universal movement. ", "Q:", " If humans are born to run, as you argue, what\u2019s your advice for a runner who is looking to make the leap from shorter road races to marathons, or marathons to ultramarathons? Is running really for everyone?", "CM:", " I think ultrarunning is America\u2019s hope for the future. Honestly. The ultrarunners have got a hold of some powerful wisdom. You can see it at the starting line of any ultra race. I showed up at the Leadville Trail 100 expecting to see a bunch of hollow-eyed Skeletors, and instead it was, \u201cWhoah! Get a load of the hotties!\u201d Ultra runners tend to be amazingly healthy, youthful and\u2014believe it or not\u2014good looking. I couldn\u2019t figure out why, until one runner explained that throughout history, the four basic ingredients for optimal health have been clean air, good food, fresh water and low stress. And that, to a T, describes the daily life of an ultrarunner. They\u2019re out in the woods for hours at a time, breathing pine-scented breezes, eating small bursts of digestible food, downing water by the gallons, and feeling their stress melt away with the miles. But here\u2019s the real key to that kingdom: you have to relax and enjoy the run. No one cares how fast you run 50 miles, so ultrarunners don\u2019t really stress about times. They\u2019re out to enjoy the run and finish strong, not shave a few inconsequential seconds off a personal best. And that\u2019s the best way to transition up to big mileage races: as coach Eric told me, \u201cIf it feels like work, you\u2019re working too hard.\u201d ", "Q:", " You write that distance running is the great equalizer of age and gender. Can you explain?", "CM:", " Okay, I\u2019ll answer that question with a question: Starting at age nineteen, runners get faster every year until they hit their peak at twenty-seven. After twenty-seven, they start to decline. So if it takes you eight years to reach your peak, how many years does it take for you to regress back to the same speed you were running at nineteen?", "Go ahead, guess all you want. No one I\u2019ve asked has ever come close. It\u2019s in the book, so I won\u2019t give it away, but I guarantee when you hear the answer, you\u2019ll say, \u201cNo way. THAT old?\u201d Now, factor in this: ultra races are the only sport in the world in which women can go toe-to-toe with men and hand them their heads. Ann Trason and Krissy Moehl often beat every man in the field in some ultraraces, while Emily Baer recently finished in the Top 10 at the Hardrock 100 while stopping to breastfeed her baby at the water stations.", "So how\u2019s that possible? According to a new body of research, it\u2019s because humans are the greatest distance runners on earth. We may not be fast, but we\u2019re born with such remarkable natural endurance that humans are fully capable of outrunning horses, cheetahs and antelopes. That\u2019s because we once hunted in packs and on foot; all of us, men and women alike, young and old together. ", "Q:", " One of the fascinating parts of ", "Born to Run", " is your report on how the ultrarunners eat\u2014salad for breakfast, wraps with hummus mid-run, or pizza and beer the night before a run. As a runner with a lot of miles behind him, what are your thoughts on nutrition for running?", "CM:", "  Live every day like you\u2019re on the lam. If you\u2019ve got to be ready to pick up and haul butt at a moment\u2019s notice, you\u2019re not going to be loading up on gut-busting meals. I thought I\u2019d have to go on some kind of prison-camp diet to get ready for an ultra, but the best advice I got came from coach Eric, who told me to just worry about the running and the eating would take care of itself. And he was right, sort of. I instinctively began eating smaller, more digestible meals as my miles increased, but then I went behind his back and consulted with the great Dr. Ruth Heidrich, an Ironman triathlete who lives on a vegan diet. She\u2019s the one who gave me the idea of having salad for breakfast, and it\u2019s a fantastic tip. The truth is, many of the greatest endurance athletes of all time lived on fruits and vegetables. You can get away with garbage for a while, but you pay for it in the long haul. In the book, I describe how Jenn Shelton and Billy \u201cBonehead\u201d Barnett like to chow pizza and Mountain Dew in the middle of 100-mile races, but Jenn is also a vegetarian who most days lives on veggie burgers and grapes. ", "Q:", " In this difficult financial time, we\u2019re experiencing yet another surge in the popularity of running. Can you explain this?", "CM:", " When things look worst, we run the most. Three times, America has seen distance-running skyrocket and it\u2019s always in the midst of a national crisis. The first boom came during the Great Depression; the next was in the \u201870s, when we were struggling to recover from a recession, race riots, assassinations, a criminal President and an awful war. And the third boom? One year after the Sept. 11 attacks, trailrunning suddenly became the fastest-growing outdoor sport in the country. I think there\u2019s a trigger in the human psyche that activates our first and greatest survival skill whenever we see the shadow of approaching raptors.", " (Photo \u00a9 James Rexroad)  ", "From the depths of Mexico\u2019s Copper Canyon to the heights of the Leadville Trail 100 ultramarathon in Colorado, from the centuries-old running techniques of Mexico\u2019s Tarahumara tribe to a research lab at the University of Utah, author McDougall celebrates, in this engaging and picaresque account, humankind\u2019s innate love of running. There are rogues aplenty here, such the deadly narco-traffickers who roam Copper Canyon, but there are many more who inspire, such as the Tarahumara runners, who show the rest of the world the false limitations we place on human endurance. McDougall has served as an Associated Press war correspondent, is a contributing editor to Men\u2019s Health, and runs at his home in rural Pennsylvania, and he brings all of these experiences to bear in this slyly important, highly readable account. --Alan Moores\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t--This text refers to an alternate ", "Paperback", " edition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "There's a problem loading this menu right now.", "Learn more about Amazon Prime."], "Reviews": "3,516", "Average_Rating": "4.7 out of 5 stars", "ProductDetails": ["Paperback:", "304 pages", "Publisher:", "Vintage; Reprint edition (March 29, 2011)", "Language:", "English", "ISBN-10:", "0307279189", "ISBN-13:", "978-0307279187", "Product Dimensions:", "5.2 x 0.9 x 8 inches", "Shipping Weight:", "12 ounces (", "View shipping rates and policies", ")", "Average Customer Review:"]},

Here he examines and challenges our concepts of \u201cadvantage\u201d and \u201cdisadvantage\u201d in a way that may seem intuitive to some and surprising to others. Beginning with the classic tale of David and Goliath and moving through history with figures such as Lawrence of Arabia and Martin Luther King Jr., Gladwell shows how, time and again, players labeled \u201cunderdog\u201d use that status to their advantage and prevail through the elements of cunning and surprise. He also shows how certain academic \u201cadvantages,\u201d such as getting into an Ivy League school, have downsides, in that being a \u201cbig fish in a small pond\u201d at a less prestigious school can lead to greater confidence and a better chance of success in later life. Gladwell even promotes the idea of a \u201cdesirable difficulty,\u201d such as dyslexia, a learning disability that causes much frustration for reading students but, at the same time, may force them to develop better listening and creative problem-solving skills. As usual, Gladwell presents his research in a fresh and easy-to-understand context, and he may have coined the catchphrase of the decade, \u201cUse what you got.\u201d --David Siegfried\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t--This text refers to the ", "Hardcover", " edition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "\"Truly intriguing and inspiring.\"\u2015", "Hector Tobar", ", ", "Los Angeles Times", "\"Provocative....", "David and Goliath ", "is a lean, consuming read.\"\u2015", "John Wilwol", ", ", "San Francisco Chronicle ", "\"As always, Gladwell's sweep is breathtaking and thought-provoking.\"\u2015", "Joe Nocera", ", ", "New York Times", "\"Fascinating....Gladwell is a master of synthesis.

Written in 1946, Camus's compelling and troubling tale of a disaffected, apparently amoral young man has earned a durable popularity (and remains a staple of U.S. high school literature courses) in part because it reveals so vividly the anxieties of its time. Alienation, the fear of anonymity, spiritual doubt--all could have been given a purely modern inflection in the hands of a lesser talent than Camus, who won the Nobel Prize in 1957 and was noted for his existentialist aesthetic. The remarkable trick of ", "The Stranger", ", however, is that it's not mired in period philosophy.", "  The plot is simple. A young Algerian, Meursault, afflicted with a sort of aimless inertia, becomes embroiled in the petty intrigues of a local pimp and, somewhat inexplicably, ends up killing a man. Once he's imprisoned and eventually brought to trial, his crime, it becomes apparent, is not so much  the arguably defensible murder he has committed as it is his deficient  character. The trial's proceedings are absurd, a parsing of  incidental trivialities--that Meursault, for instance, seemed unmoved by his own  mother's death and then attended a comic movie the evening after her funeral are two ostensibly damning facts--so that the eventual sentence the jury issues is both ridiculous and inevitable.", "  Meursault remains a cipher nearly to the story's end--dispassionate,  clinical, disengaged from his own emotions. \"She wanted to know if I loved her,\" he says of his girlfriend. \"I answered the same way I had the last time, that it didn't mean anything but that I probably didn't.\" There's a latent ominousness in such observations, a sense that devotion is nothing more than self-delusion. It's undoubtedly true that Meursault exhibits an extreme of resignation; however, his confrontation with \"the gentle indifference of the world\" remains as compelling as it was when Camus first recounted it. ", "--Ben Guterson", "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "The new translation of Camus's classic is a cultural event; the translation of Cocteau's diary is a literary event. Both translations are superb, but Ward's will affect a naturalized narrative, while Browner's will strengthen Cocteau's reemerging critical standing. Since 1946 untold thousands of American students have read a broadly interpretative, albeit beautifully crafted British Stranger . Such readers have closed Part I on \"door of undoing\" and Part II on \"howls of execration.\" Now with the domestications pruned away from the text, students will be as close to the original as another language will allow: \"door of unhappiness\" and \"cries of hate.\" Browner has no need to \"write-over\" another translation. With Cocteau's reputation chiefly as a cineaste until recently, he has been read in French or not at all. Further, the essay puts a translator under less pressure to normalize for readers' expectations. Both translations show the current trend to stay closer to the original.

Written for skeptics and the believers who love them, the book draws on the author's encounters as founding pastor of New York's booming Redeemer Presbyterian Church. One of Keller's most provocative arguments is that all doubts, however skeptical and cynical they may seem, are really a set of alternate beliefs. Drawing on sources as diverse as 19th-century author Robert Louis Stevenson and contemporary New Testament theologian N.T. Wright, Keller attempts to deconstruct everyone he finds in his way, from the evolutionary psychologist Richard Dawkins to popular author Dan Brown. The first, shorter part of the book looks at popular arguments against God's existence, while the second builds on general arguments for God to culminate in a sharp focus on the redemptive work of God in Christ. Keller's condensed summaries of arguments for and against theism make the scope of the book overwhelming at times. Nonetheless, it should serve both as testimony to the author's encyclopedic learning and as a compelling overview of the current debate on faith for those who doubt and for those who want to re-evaluate what they believe, and why.

For with this tightly reasoned defense of faith, he challenges the evangelists of doubt on their own ground. One by one, the arguments for unbelief fall before Keller\u2019s unrelenting logic. The claim that science has disproved religion comes in for particular scrutiny, as Keller deflects the antireligious syllogism that converts evolutionary theory into an obituary for orthodoxy. Keller even turns the tables on rationalists, adducing compelling evidence for scriptural doctrines, including the physical resurrection of Christ. And although Keller frankly acknowledges that inquisitors have justified atrocities as religious duties, he nonetheless traces the modern concept of human rights back to religious roots and exposes the fragility of such rights when shorn from those roots. We start down the road to Hitler\u2019s death camps and Stalin\u2019s gulag,\u00a0he warns, whenever we refuse to recognize in fellow humans the divine image of God. But by recognizing that image, Keller affirms, we open sacred possibilities not only for redemption in the hereafter but also for social justice here and now. Readers expecting Keller to deliver the usual pious bromides may experience a profound shock to their spiritual and social complacency. --Bryce Christensen\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t--This text refers to an alternate ", "Paperback", " edition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "There's a problem loading this menu right now.", "Learn more about Amazon Prime."], "Reviews": "1,253", "Average_Rating": "4.7 out of 5 stars", "ProductDetails": ["Paperback:", "310 pages", "Publisher:", "Penguin Books; Reprint edition (August 4, 2009)", "Language:", "English", "ISBN-10:", "1594483493", "ISBN-13:", "978-1594483493", "Product Dimensions:", "5.2 x 0.9 x 8 inches", "Shipping Weight:", "1 pounds (", "View shipping rates and policies", ")", "Average Customer Review:"]},

The recent discovery of the first half of Twain's manuscript, long thought lost, made front-page news.  And this unprecedented edition, which contains for the first time omitted episodes and other variations present in the first half of the handwritten manuscript, as well as facsimile reproductions of thirty manuscript pages, is indispensable to a full understanding of the novel.  The changes, deletions, and additions made in the first half of the manuscript indicate that Mark Twain frequently checked his impulse to write an even darker, more confrontational book than the one he finally published.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t--This text refers to an alternate ", "Paperback", " edition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "Considered the first great American novel, part of Finn's charm is the wisdom and sobering social criticism deftly lurking amongst the seemingly innocent observations of the uneducated Huck and the even-less-educated escaped slave, Jim. William Dufris's voice, unpretentious and disarming, like the book's main characters, seems the perfect armature on which to hang this literary strategy. Although he does an expert job with the entire cast, Dufris's delivery of Jim's dialogue is his crowning achievement. Out of context, Dufris's Jim might sound mocking and racist, due to his expert delivery of Twain's regional vernacular. Ignorance and intelligence, however, are not mutually exclusive, and taken as a whole, Jim's mind and heart come shining through, allowing the listener to reflect on their own assumptions.

", "The way the sentence is written, the ambulance driver is barely speaking\u0097but surely that\u0092s not what the writer meant.

That way, the sentence would read:  ", "Witnesses reported that the woman with flowing black hair was driving the getaway car.

", "That\u0092s quite a baby who can run a six-mile road race (even while being sick).

", "One of the most common problems with misplaced modifiers comes with what are called limiting modifiers\u0097words like almost, even, hardly, just, merely, nearly, only (only is the one misplaced most often), scarcely, and simply.

The most memorable passages are contained in \"On Booker T. Washington and Others,\" where Du Bois criticizes his famous contemporary's rejection of higher education and accommodationist stance toward white racism: \"Mr. Washington's programme practically accepts the alleged inferiority of the Negro races,\" he writes, further complaining that Washington's thinking \"withdraws many of the high demands of Negroes as men and American citizens.\" The capstone of ", "The Souls of Black Folk", ", though, is Du Bois' haunting, eloquent description of the concept of the black psyche's \"double consciousness,\" which he described as \"a peculiar sensation.... One ever feels this twoness--an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\" Thanks to W.E.B.

Since then, Mike has used a variety of channels to help tens of thousands of students with the SAT, PSAT, ACT, GRE, LSAT, GMAT, ISEE, and SSAT. He regularly travels to work with students all across the United States, and consults with students all over the world through Skype. He speaks at live events as well, and is available for booking.  Mike's ACT strategies are so different from the traditional approach because he analyzes standardized tests from the ground up, rather than simply assuming that they cover the material they claim to cover.  In other words, most ACT tutors and courses teach the same math, reading, and writing skills that you learn in high school, because they mistakenly assume that the ACT is a test of college readiness. But Mike has looked carefully at large numbers of real ACT questions, and knows that they don't reward the same things that teachers reward in high school and college.  According to Mike, ACT questions generally rely on very basic concepts but present them in very strange ways. So students who want to improve their test scores shouldn't waste time re-learning what they've already learned in school - instead, they should learn how the ACT actually works, so they can take their existing knowledge and leverage it into a higher score.  And this is exactly what Mike teaches you to do in the ACT Prep Black Book.  If you want to understand how the ACT actually works, you need to read this book.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "There's a problem loading this menu right now.", "Learn more about Amazon Prime."], "Reviews": "142", "Average_Rating": "4.3 out of 5 stars", "ProductDetails": ["Paperback:", "436 pages", "Publisher:", "ACT Prep Books; 1 edition (April 6, 2014)", "Language:", "English", "ISBN-10:", "0692027912", "ISBN-13:", "978-0692027912", "Product Dimensions:", "8.5 x 1 x 11 inches", "Shipping Weight:", "2.9 pounds (", "View shipping rates and policies", ")", "Average Customer Review:"]},

I just got my June LSAT score back, and was pleasantly surprised to have received a 179. My initial diagnostic placed me at 153, but after working with your two books, I was able to dramatically increase my speed and accuracy in logic games and logical reasoning. Your books are easy to understand and worth their weight in gold. Thank you!!! --Michael Wang<br \\><br \\>The Logic Games Bible was the single most effective tool I used to study for the games section. Everything was presented in a systematic way, which in turn helped me to think and perform in a systematic way during the actual exam. I highly recommend this book to all my friends taking the LSAT. --Prem Amarnani<br \\><br \\>I'm an LSAT instructor with another national prep company.

If someone had, I would not now be taking the test again. I noticed, for example, that certain techniques those books had taught me were leading me to complete logic games slower than I would have had I not been taught any techniques at all! Ha! Not so with the PowerScore Bible.

It's been yet another infuriating and boring summer with the despicable Dursleys, this time with minimal contact from our hero's non-Muggle friends from school. Harry is feeling especially edgy at the lack of news from the magic world, wondering when the freshly revived evil Lord Voldemort will strike. Returning to Hogwarts will be a relief... or will it?", "  The fifth book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series follows the darkest year yet for our young wizard, who finds himself knocked down a peg or three after the events of last year. Somehow, over the summer, gossip (usually traced back to the magic world's newspaper, the ", "Daily Prophet", ") has turned Harry's tragic and heroic encounter with Voldemort at the Triwizard Tournament into an excuse to ridicule and discount the teen. Even Professor Dumbledore, headmaster of the school, has come under scrutiny by the Ministry of Magic, which refuses to officially acknowledge the terrifying truth that Voldemort is back. Enter a particularly loathsome new character: the toadlike and simpering (\"", "hem, hem", "\") Dolores Umbridge, senior undersecretary to the Minister of Magic, who takes over the vacant position of Defense Against Dark Arts teacher--and in no time manages to become the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, as well. Life isn't getting any easier for Harry Potter. With an overwhelming course load as the fifth years prepare for their Ordinary Wizarding Levels examinations (O.W.Ls), devastating changes in the Gryffindor Quidditch team lineup, vivid dreams about long hallways and closed doors, and increasing pain in his lightning-shaped scar, Harry's resilience is sorely tested.", "  ", "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", ", more than any of the four previous novels in the series, is a coming-of-age story.

Gone is the wide-eyed innocent, the whiz kid of ", "Sorcerer's Stone", ". Here we have an adolescent who's sometimes sullen, often confused (especially about girls), and always self-questioning. Confronting death again, as well as a startling prophecy, Harry ends his year at Hogwarts exhausted and pensive. Readers, on the other hand, will be energized as they enter yet again the long waiting period for the next title in the marvelous, magical series.

Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry's certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry's confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry's gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician's struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore's very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry.

Moving through time loops, they meet a menagerie of characters who help them along the way, but danger lurks at every corner, and horrors are not far behind. Even if the teens reach London alive, will it be enough to save Miss Peregrine from an ornithological fate? This book is perfectly paced, suspenseful, and scary. It is dark and dreadful but also humorous and touching. The peculiars are intriguing, each with fascinating powers, such as invisibility or premonition. They play off of one another's strengths and weaknesses, which progresses the story and further develops the characters. And of course there is the book's main attraction: the found vernacular photography, vintage pictures that Riggs has collected from flea markets and archives. The quirky and creepy snapshots perfectly illustrate the characters and settings, reinforcing the dark atmosphere of the narrative.

The haunting story centers on twelve-year-old Jonas, who lives in a seemingly ideal, if colorless, world of conformity and contentment. Not until he is given his life assignment as the Receiver of Memory does he begin to understand the dark, complex secrets behind his fragile community. Lois Lowry has written three companion novels to ", "The Giver, ", "including ", "Gathering Blue, Messenger,", " and ", "Son.", " Sponsored Products are advertisements for products sold by merchants on Amazon.com.

", " ", "In a world with no poverty, no crime, no sickness and no unemployment, and where every family is happy, 12-year-old Jonas is chosen to be the community's Receiver of Memories. Under the tutelage of the Elders and an old man known as the Giver, he discovers the disturbing truth about his utopian world and struggles against the weight of its hypocrisy. With echoes of ", "Brave New World", ", in this 1994 ", "Newbery Medal", " winner, Lowry examines the idea that people might freely choose to give up their humanity in order to create a more stable society. Gradually Jonas learns just how costly this ordered and pain-free society can be, and boldly decides he cannot pay the price.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t--This text refers to the ", "Hardcover", " edition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "In the \"ideal\" world into which Jonas was born, everybody has sensibly agreed that well-matched married couples will raise exactly two offspring, one boy and one girl. These children's adolescent sexual impulses will be stifled with specially prescribed drugs; at age 12 they will receive an appropriate career assignment, sensibly chosen by the community's Elders. This is a world in which the old live in group homes and are \"released\"--to great celebration--at the proper time; the few infants who do not develop according to schedule are also \"released,\" but with no fanfare. Lowry's development of this civilization is so deft that her readers, like the community's citizens, will be easily seduced by the chimera of this ordered, pain-free society. Until the time that Jonah begins training for his job assignment--the rigorous and prestigious position of Receiver of Memory--he, too, is a complacent model citizen. But as his near-mystical training progresses, and he is weighed down and enriched with society's collective memories of a world as stimulating as it was flawed, Jonas grows increasingly aware of the hypocrisy that rules his world. With a storyline that hints at Christian allegory and an eerie futuristic setting, this intriguing novel calls to mind John Christopher's Tripods trilogy and Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Match Girl. Lowry is once again in top form--raising many questions while answering few, and unwinding a tale fit for the most adventurous readers. Ages 12-14.

You\u2019re torn between past, present, and future, realizing the only way you can go is forward. That\u2019s a scary realization. Sometimes we just want to hit pause. Sometimes we want to go back.

Also, part of the pleasure\u2014and point\u2014of the book, was allowing the girls to have more perspective on their choices this time around, more awareness not just of themselves but of each other and the world.

It is difficult to feel pity for Sam; she is snobbish, obnoxious, a cheater, and just plain mean. However, her gradual and complete transformation is so convincing that when she finally puts others before herself in order to save another life, it is moving and cathartic.

They carried the common secret of cowardice.... Men killed, and died, because they were embarrassed not to.\"", "  A finalist for both the 1990 Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award, ", "The Things They Carried", " marks a subtle but definitive line of demarcation between Tim O'Brien's earlier works about Vietnam, the memoir ", "If I Die in a Combat  Zone", " and the fictional  ", "Going After Cacciato", ", and this sly, almost hallucinatory book that is neither memoir nor novel nor collection of short stories but rather an artful combination of all three. Vietnam is still O'Brien's theme, but in this book he seems less interested in the war itself than in the myriad different perspectives from which he depicts it. Whereas ", "Going After Cacciato", " played with reality, ", "The Things They Carried", " plays with truth. The narrator of most of these stories is \"Tim\"; yet O'Brien freely admits that many of the events he chronicles in this collection never really happened. He never killed a man as \"Tim\" does in \"The Man I Killed,\" and unlike Tim in \"Ambush,\" he has no daughter named Kathleen. But just because a thing never happened doesn't make it any less true. In \"On the Rainy River,\" the character Tim O'Brien responds to his draft notice by driving north, to the Canadian border where he spends six days in a deserted lodge in the company of an old man named Elroy while he wrestles with the choice between dodging the draft or going to war. The real Tim O'Brien never drove north, never found himself in a fishing boat 20 yards off the Canadian shore with a decision to make. The real Tim O'Brien quietly boarded the bus to Sioux Falls and was inducted into the United States Army. But the truth of \"On the Rainy River\" lies not in facts but in the genuineness of the experience it depicts: both Tims went to a war they didn't believe in; both considered themselves cowards for doing so. Every story in ", "The Things They Carried", " speaks another truth that Tim O'Brien learned in Vietnam; it is this blurred line between truth and reality, fact and fiction, that makes his book unforgettable.

He has little time to realize how alone he is, because he is so busy just trying to survive. And learning to survive, to plan on food not just for a day but untiland ifhe is rescued, only begins when he stops pitying himself and understands that no one can help him. He is on his own, without his divorced father, whom he was to visit, or his mother, whom Brian saw kissing another man before the divorce. This is a heart-stopping story: it seems that at every moment Brian is forced to face a life-and-death decision, and every page makes readers wonder at the density of descriptive detail Paulsen has expertly woven together. Poetic texture and realistic events are combined to create something beyond adventure, a book that plunges readers into the cleft of the protagonist's experience. Ages 11-13. ", "Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t--This text refers to the ", "Library Binding", " edition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "Grade 8-12 Brian Robeson, 13, is the only passenger on a small plane flying him to visit his father in the Canadian wilderness when the pilot has a heart attack and dies. The plane drifts off course and finally crashes into a small lake. Miraculously Brian is able to swim free of the plane, arriving on a sandy tree-lined shore with only his clothing, a tattered windbreaker, and the hatchet his mother had given him as a present. The novel chronicles in gritty detail Brian's mistakes, setbacks, and small triumphs as, with the help of the hatchet, he manages to survive the 54 days alone in the wilderness. Paulsen effectively shows readers how Brian learns patienceto watch, listen, and think before he actsas he attempts to build a fire, to fish and hunt, and to make his home under a rock overhang safe and comfortable. An epilogue discussing the lasting effects of Brian's stay in the wilderness and his dim chance of survival had winter come upon him before rescue adds credibility to the story. Paulsen tells a fine adventure story, but the sub-plot concerning Brian's preoccupation with his parents' divorce seems a bit forced and detracts from the book. As he did in Dogsong (Bradbury, 1985), Paulsen emphasizes character growth through a careful balancing of specific details of survival with the protagonist's thoughts and emotions.

He's one of 13 people who receive Hannah's story, which details the circumstances that led to her suicide. Clay spends the rest of the day and long into the night listening to Hannah's voice and going to the locations she wants him to visit. The text alternates, sometimes quickly, between Hannah's voice (italicized) and Clay's thoughts as he listens to her words, which illuminate betrayals and secrets that demonstrate the consequences of even small actions. Hannah, herself, is not free from guilt, her own inaction having played a part in an accidental auto death and a rape. The message about how we treat one another, although sometimes heavy, makes for compelling reading. Give this to fans of Gail Giles psychological thrillers.

Without this acceptance, he argues, the nation dooms itself to \"sterility and decay\" and to eventual destruction at the hands of the oppressed: \"The Negroes of this country may never be able to rise to power, but they are very well placed indeed to precipitate chaos and ring down the curtain on the American dream.\"", "  Baldwin's seething insights and directives, so disturbing to the white liberals and black moderates of his day, have become the starting point for discussions of American race relations: that debasement and oppression of one people by another is \"a recipe for murder\"; that \"color is not a human or a personal reality; it is a political reality\"; that whites can only truly liberate themselves when they liberate blacks, indeed when they \"become black\" symbolically and spiritually; that blacks and whites \"deeply need each other here\" in order for America to realize its identity as a nation. ", "  Yet despite its edgy tone and the strong undercurrent of violence, ", "The Fire Next Time", " is ultimately a hopeful and healing essay. Baldwin ranges far in these hundred pages--from a memoir of his abortive teenage religious awakening in Harlem (an interesting commentary on his first novel ", "Go Tell It on the Mountain", ") to a disturbing encounter with Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad. But what binds it all together is the eloquence, intimacy, and controlled urgency of the voice. Baldwin clearly paid in sweat and shame for every word in this text. What's incredible is that he managed to keep his cool. ", "--David Laskin", "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "Speakers or headsets will have to be turned up to listen to Jesse L. Martin's low, slow reading of Baldwin's classic long essay on racism and African-American identity. Martin seeks to be respectful of Baldwin, but he ends up rendering the meaning and the force of his work relatively inert. Pausing in poorly selected places, placing emphasis where little should be placed, Martin does not convey the precision and anger of Baldwin's prose. Instead, Baldwin's book becomes Great Literature, to be intoned and honored, but not truly grasped. Readers with an interest in Baldwin's work will be far better served by reading his prose to themselves than having Martin read it to them.

A soc (short for \"social\") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny  kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the  same whether a soc or a greaser. This classic, written by S. E.

Born in Massachusetts and educated at Fisk, Harvard, and the University of Berlin, Du Bois penned his epochal masterpiece, ", "The Souls of Black Folk", ", in 1903. It remains his most studied and popular work; its insights into Negro life at the turn of the 20th century still ring true.", "  With a dash of the Victorian and Enlightenment influences that peppered his impassioned yet formal prose, the book's largely autobiographical chapters take the reader through the momentous and moody maze of Afro-American life after the Emancipation Proclamation: from poverty, the neoslavery of the sharecropper, illiteracy, miseducation, and lynching, to the heights of humanity reached by the spiritual \"sorrow songs\" that birthed gospel and the blues. The most memorable passages are contained in \"On Booker T. Washington and Others,\" where Du Bois criticizes his famous contemporary's rejection of higher education and accommodationist stance toward white racism: \"Mr. Washington's programme practically accepts the alleged inferiority of the Negro races,\" he writes, further complaining that Washington's thinking \"withdraws many of the high demands of Negroes as men and American citizens.\" The capstone of ", "The Souls of Black Folk", ", though, is Du Bois' haunting, eloquent description of the concept of the black psyche's \"double consciousness,\" which he described as \"a peculiar sensation.... One ever feels this twoness--an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\" Thanks to W.E.B. Du Bois' commitment and foresight--and the intellectual excellence expressed in this timeless literary gem--black Americans can today look in the mirror and rejoice in their beautiful black, brown, and beige reflections.

Rowling doesn't write children's books, she writes children's stories, more in the tradition of the Brothers Grimm than Dr. Seuss. The exploits of Harry and his friends captivate even the shortest attention spans by engaging the imagination with vivid characters and fast-moving action, instead of trying to merely catch the eye with colorful pictures or pop-up effects. Not surprisingly, the Potter tales sound wonderful read aloud, and adapt to the audiobook format extremely well. Broadway actor Jim Dale's impressive vocal range gives each character in the book its own distinctive voice--a considerable task, given the pantheon of witches, warlocks, ghosts, ghouls, dwarves, and elves that Harry encounters in his second outing. And thankfully, since the book is read unabridged, no one's favorite character is omitted.

Things don't go as well, though, when the school term begins. Someone, or something, is (literally) petrifying Hogwarts' residents one by one and leaving threatening messages referring to a Chamber of Secrets and an heir of Slytherin. Somehow, Harry is often around when the attacks happen and he is soon suspected of being the perpetrator. The climax has Harry looking very much like Indiana Jones, battling a giant serpent in the depths of the awesome and terrible Chamber of Secrets. Along with most of the teachers and students introduced in the previous book, Draco Malfoy has returned for his second year and is more despicable than ever.

Death himself narrates the World War II-era story of Liesel Meminger from the time she is taken, at age nine, to live in Molching, Germany, with a foster family in a working-class neighborhood of tough kids, acid-tongued mothers, and loving fathers who earn their living by the work of their hands. The child arrives having just stolen her first book\u2013although she has not yet learned how to read\u2013and her foster father uses it, ", "The Gravediggers Handbook", ", to lull her to sleep when shes roused by regular nightmares about her younger brothers death. Across the ensuing years of the late 1930s and into the 1940s, Liesel collects more stolen books as well as a peculiar set of friends: the boy Rudy, the Jewish refugee Max, the mayors reclusive wife (who has a whole library from which she allows Liesel to steal), and especially her foster parents. Zusak not only creates a mesmerizing and original story but also writes with poetic syntax, causing readers to deliberate over phrases and lines, even as the action impels them forward. Death is not a sentimental storyteller, but he does attend to an array of satisfying details, giving Liesels story all the nuances of chance, folly, and fulfilled expectation that it deserves.

", "America's national parks are full of timeless marvels that still rejuvenate the soul: the world's largest trees in Sequoia; its most spectacular geothermal site in Yellowstone; the grandest canyon. Perhaps the movement's most eloquent description that is still resonates came from national parks advocate John Muir: 'Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home; that wildness is a necessity...' Fortunately for the nerve-shaken, over-civilized people of then and now, President Woodrow Wilson created the National Parks Service (NPS) on August 25, 1916, though the drive to protect some of America's most remarkable wild spaces, to be 'used and preserved for the benefit of mankind', began in the 1860s. ", "From Acadia to Zion, this beautiful introduction to America's preserved natural treasures is packed with landscape photography, original wildlife illustrations, and practical information. You will surely be inspired to rediscover these incredible spaces and find out why they're worth celebrating and you'll have all the tools to plan the first of many exciting trips. ", "This book is intended to be a practical introduction to each of America's 59 national parks, distilled by Lonely Planet's expert authors. We highlight the best activities and trails, explain how to get there and where to stay, show you the wildlife to watch out for, and suggest ideal itineraries. Whether you're lucky enough to have a park on your doorstep or need to travel further, we hope that the following pages inspire you both the iconic and lesser-known gems that make up the USA's diversely breathtaking expanses.

Human beings everywhere and in every era have confronted the same familiar, intimate situations in surprisingly different ways.

Detractors will be appalled by this as well as when the book argues that fleeting negative thoughts are powerful enough to create terminal illness, poverty and even widespread disasters. The audio version of this controversial book, read by Byrne and contributing authors such as John Gray and Neale Donald Walsch, is uneven at best. The cheesy, obvious sound effects will not do much to add intellectual respectability to a work that has been widely denounced as pseudoscience. Mostly, this audio is hampered by its confusing and disjointed organization\u2014techniques that worked reasonably well in the print version and the movie, such as cutting every few seconds from one enthusiastic expert to another, make for a choppy and somewhat bewildering listening experience. The gentle cadences of Rhonda Byrne's breathy, Aussie-infused voice are certainly the best part of the audio, but her material is scarce and provides mostly connective tissue between the testimonials.

I am so pleased that Rhonda Byrne was able to bring  together this life-changing information so masterfully. She first did it  for the movie of the  same name that she produced, which has been a  phenomenon in its own right. She then added, in only ones month's time,  incredible additional content to the transcript of the film that brings  even more clarity to the reader. This is absolutely a book that people from  all walks of life can read and then \"get\" the concept of The Secret. It  allows them to then take it and apply it to their lives. Children,  teenagers and adults of all ages are reporting miraculous stories of  positive changes as a result.  Rhonda Byrne is dedicated to maintaining the integrity of The Secret and to  making sure that now, finally, the whole world knows about The Secret. You  will want to share this with your friends and family and they will be  grateful for it. This book gives hope for what many have been waiting for--  a shift in the way the world thinks.

Labeled a \u201cwretched,\u201d an outcast unwanted and unworthy of respect, Lia is forbidden to realize her dream to read or write. All but doomed, her days are spent toiling away as a kitchen slave under the charge of the Aldermaston, the Abbey\u2019s watchful overseer. But when an injured squire named Colvin is abandoned at the kitchen\u2019s doorstep, an opportunity arises.

The girl, Nya, is fetching water from a pond that is two hours\u2019 walk from her home: she makes two trips to the pond every day. The boy, Salva, becomes one of the \"lost boys\" of Sudan, refugees who cover the African continent on foot as they search for their families and for a safe place to stay. Enduring every hardship from loneliness to attack by armed rebels to contact with killer lions and crocodiles, Salva is a survivor, and his story goes on to intersect with Nya\u2019s in an astonishing and moving way.", " Sponsored Products are advertisements for products sold by merchants on Amazon.com.

Salva's journey, based on a true story, begins in 1985 with an explosion. The boy's small village in Sudan erupts into chaos while the 11-year-old is in school, and the teacher tells the children to run away. Salva leaves his family and all that is familiar and begins to walk. Sometimes he walks alone and sometimes there are others. They are walking toward a refugee camp in Ethiopia, toward perceived safety. However, the camp provides only temporary shelter from the violent political storm. In 1991-'92, thousands are killed as they try to cross a crocodile-infested river when they are forced out of the country; Salva survives and gets 1200 boys to safety in Kenya. Nya's life in 2008 revolves around water. She spends eight hours a day walking to and from a pond. In the dry season, her family must uproot themselves and relocate to the dry lake bed where they dig in the mud until water eventually trickles out. Nya's narrative frames Salva's journey from Sudan to Ethiopia to Rochester, NY, and, eventually, back to Sudan. Both story lines are spare, offering only pertinent details. In the case of Salva, six years in a camp pass by with the barest of mentions. This minimalism streamlines the plot, providing a clarity that could have easily become mired in depressing particulars. The two narratives intersect in a quiet conclusion that is filled with hope.\u2013Naphtali L. Faris, Saint Louis Public Library, MO\u03b1(c) Copyright 2010.

After he is adopted by a family in Rochester, New York, he is reunited with the Sudanese family that he left behind. There have been several books about the lost boys of Sudan for adults, teens, and even for elementary-school readers. But Newbery Award\u2013winning Park\u2019s spare, immediate account, based on a true story, adds a stirring contemporary dimension. In chapters that alternate with Salva\u2019s story, Nya, a young Sudanese girl in 2008, talks about daily life, in which she walks eight hours to fetch water for her family. Then, a miracle happens: Salva returns home to help his people and builds a well, making fresh water available for the community and freeing Nya to go to school. The switching viewpoints may initially disorient some, but young readers will be stunned by the triumphant climax of the former refugee who makes a difference with the necessities that we all take for granted. Teachers may want to point out the allusion to Nelson Mandela\u2019s A Long Walk to Freedom (1995) echoed in this moving book\u2019s title.

Our lives are being transformed in so many realms all at once\u2015and it is dizzying.", "     In ", "Thank You for Being Late", ", a work unlike anything he has attempted before, Thomas L. Friedman exposes the tectonic movements that are reshaping the world today and explains how to get the most out of them and cushion their worst impacts.

After a quick tutorial, he proceeds to write what could only be called a giant column about the twenty-first century. His thesis: to understand the twenty-first century, you need to understand that the planet\u2019s three largest forces\u2015Moore\u2019s law (technology), the Market (globalization), and Mother Nature (climate change and biodiversity loss)\u2015are accelerating all at once. These accelerations are transforming five key realms: the workplace, politics, geopolitics, ethics, and community.", "     Why is this happening? As Friedman shows, the exponential increase in computing power defined by Moore\u2019s law has a lot to do with it. The year 2007 was a major inflection point: the release of the iPhone, together with advances in silicon chips, software, storage, sensors, and networking, created a new technology platform. Friedman calls this platform \u201cthe supernova\u201d\u2015for it is an extraordinary release of energy that is reshaping everything from how we hail a taxi to the fate of nations to our most intimate relationships. It is creating vast new opportunities for individuals and small groups to save the world\u2015or to destroy it.", "     Thank You for Being Late", " is a work of contemporary history that serves as a field manual for how to write and think about this era of accelerations. It\u2019s also an argument for \u201cbeing late\u201d\u2015for pausing to appreciate this amazing historical epoch we\u2019re passing through and to reflect on its possibilities and dangers. To amplify this point, Friedman revisits his Minnesota hometown in his moving concluding chapters; there, he explores how communities can create a \u201ctopsoil of trust\u201d to anchor their increasingly diverse and digital populations.", "     With his trademark vitality, wit, and optimism, Friedman shows that we can overcome the multiple stresses of an age of accelerations\u2015if we slow down, if we dare to be late and use the time to reimagine work, politics, and community.

Since the mid-1970s, Gaskin and the midwives in her practice on a Summertown, Tenn., commune known as \"The Farm,\" have attended over 2,200 natural births. Gaskin, who learned the rudiments of her gentle birthing technique from the Mayans in Guatemala, has helped bring attention to the method's remarkably low rate of morbidity and medical intervention. Couples considering natural childbirth will get inspirational coaxing from more than a dozen first-person narratives shared by the author's clients. Gaskin decries what she sees as Western medicine's focus on pain during birth, arguing that natural birthing can not only be euphoric and blissful but also orgasmic (a survey of 150 natural birthing women \"found thirty-two who reported experiencing at least one orgasmic birth\"). The second half of Gaskin's book deals with the practical side of natural birthing, including how to avoid standard medical interventions such as epidurals, episiotomies and even prenatal amniocentesis that may be unnecessary, even dangerous, to mother or child. While this may not be the definitive guide to natural childbirth, it is a comfortable and supportive read for women who want to trust their bodies to do what comes naturally. ", "Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "Using history as her guide, nationally recognized midwife Gaskin explores what she hopes will be a renaissance in natural childbirth, something that she's been advocating since the mid-1970s. By focusing on how women of ancient civilizations and other modern peoples give birth, Gaskin puts our own hypersensitivities in perspective, uncovering a beautiful, sometimes orgasmic experience rather than a dreadful, painful one. Sure, pain is part of childbirth, but preparing for the pain in a realistic rather than sentimental way--whether giving birth at home or in a hospital--can be the key to a woman's ability to deal with it naturally. Within the pages of personal anecdotes, some touching, some startling, from Gaskin's patients and colleagues, every woman is sure to find something to relate to, whether or not she chooses to have a medicine-free labor.

When the researchers spot a mysterious structure peeking out from the crumbling ice, they dock and disembark to investigate. What they find, they never could have imagined: a labyrinth older than humanity itself and an artifact from the 20th Century that was lost--but not forgotten. The discovery sets off a chain of events thousands of years in the making.\n    ", "\n        Dr. Kate Warner has spent most of her adult life running from her past. She has also spent it searching for a cure for a medical condition she believes is an emerging global epidemic: autism. In a lab in Jakarta, Indonesia, she believes she has finally found that cure. But at the moment of her breakthrough, her world is once again shattered. Her lab is attacked, her staff assaulted, and two children in her care are abducted. The mysterious intruders leave Dr. Warner unconscious. When she awakens, she's a murder suspect in police custody. She soon learns that her research has greater implications than she ever dreamed, and that her past is not what she's been told. Her work holds the key to humanity's future--for better or worse.\n    ", "\n        With time running out, Kate decides to risk everything to unravel the mystery her research has uncovered: the Atlantis Gene. Her journey takes her around the globe and deep inside a far-reaching conspiracy. The revelations that unfold will rewrite the history of human origins--and if her adversaries capture her, the future of human evolution.\n    ", "\n        1: There's a lot going on in The Atlantis Gene. So what's this story really about?\n    ", "\n        Human origins.\n    ", "\n        2: Wait, that's it?!\n    ", "\n        Well, there is a bit more going on. \n    ", "\n        The science in the novel explores human evolution and the great unsolved mysteries in our past.\n    ", "\n        It's also about a group of characters struggling to figure out who they are. Each is trying to come to grips with tragedy in their past and learn what truly happened.\n    ", "\n        I think that's part of the fun of the novel: it explores these compelling mysteries in science and history through the eyes of characters who have their own personal mysteries to unravel--and the two worlds collide and work together.\n    ", "\n        3: Where do you even start to work on a novel like that--one with so many plot threads and background info?\n    ", "\n        The science. What got me started was the scientific mystery at the heart of The Atlantis Gene: 70,000 years ago, the human race almost went extinct. A supervolcano in present day Indonesia erupted and lowered global temperatures. This volcanic winter lasted for years and decimated species around the globe. We were one of them. Scientists have estimated that humanity was reduced to as few as 10,000 surviving members and perhaps as few as 1,000 mating pairs. It's amazing we survived, but what's even more mysterious is that we thrived in the years after. We went on to conquer the globe and change the world like no species ever has before. There are now over seven billion of us. All of our genetic relatives--Neanderthals, Denosivans, and many others--all went extinct during our march across the world. Many of them had walked the planet for hundreds of thousands of years before us. To me, that's the greatest mystery of all time: how a relatively young species, teetering on the brink of extinction, could bounce back and master the world like none ever has before. It's our story, and some day we'll know the truth. For now, novels like The Atlantis Gene present what I hope are exciting theories.\n    ", "\n        4: What's your research process like? Do you enjoy it?\n    ", "\n        I enjoy doing research a great deal, mostly because I write about topics and mysteries that excite me personally. Research is a lot of work, but if I'm really fascinated by what I'm learning, it doesn't feel like it. I wake up every morning wanting to know more. Each revelation leads to another question.\n    ", "\n        Genetics and human evolution have always fascinated me. I worked on autism research for years, so joining the two fields in the novel was intriguing to me. The history aspects, especially the Toba Catastrophe, really got me excited.\n    ", "\n        My research process is a bit of trial and error. I typically start with popular articles--they're a good gauge of what readers and a wide audience might enjoy learning more about. From there, I select topics to deep dive on and begin reading journal articles and non-fiction books. Inevitably, some topics don't fit with the plot; one of the hardest things to do is discard research I think is compelling but doesn't fit the story.\n    ", "\n        5: After research, what's next in your process?\n    ", "\n        Once I feel good about the science and history, I brainstorm plot ideas to explore those topics and characters that would be involved. It's the same principle: I come up with ideas that excite me, twists and story arcs I haven't seen before that I would love to read, and think about characters that would fascinate me--people I would want to know more about.\n    ", "\n        6: Do you outline your novels?\n    ", "\n        I do. The novels are very intricate and the outline gives me a lot of confidence when I begin writing. When I'm writing a first draft, I find it best to write every day; I like to keep the momentum, but I also think it helps maintain a consistent narrative voice.\n    ", "\n        At some point in all my novels, however, the outline gets rewritten. Characters surprise me. Scenes I had planned don't pan out the way I imagined. Some twists turn out better than expected, some fall short. It's always a process of reflecting and adjusting course as I go. Smaller issues get taken care of during editing, but I like to zoom out occasionally and make sure I feel like the story is on track.\n    ", "\n        7: The book has become a runaway hit. The trilogy has sold well over a million copies, a film series is in development, and dozens of foreign publishers have released the books in hardcover and paperback around the world. When you released the book, did you have any idea it would be so popular?\n    ", "\n        I had high hopes but never dreamed it would be so successful.\n    ", "\n        The Atlantis Gene is my first novel, and I'm still proud of it. It was a lot of work. I spent two and a half years writing it full-time, and it really became a labor of love. When it was done, I created the first cover myself and did the ebook and print formatting. \n    ", "\n        After working on something for so long and being involved in every detail, it's a little nerve-wracking to release it to the world, to put your work on display--and open to criticism.\n    ", "\n        Overall, the book's success and the feedback I've gotten from readers has been very inspiring. It's helped me grow as an author and given me a lot of motivation to keep pushing the envelope and taking chances. Success can be a double-edged sword: it can feel like you have nowhere to go but down. I try not to see it that way. For me, it makes me want to work harder, to ensure that every book is better than the last. I've been very fortunate that my work has found such a wonderful group of readers, and I'd like to thank everyone who took a chance on the book.\n    ", "There's a problem loading this menu right now.", "Learn more about Amazon Prime."]},

", "   ", "To get the free app, enter your mobile phone number.", "What Doesn't Kill Us", " traces our evolutionary journey back to a time when survival depended on how well we adapted to the environment around us. Our ancestors crossed the Alps in animal skins and colonized the New World in loin cloths. They evaded predators and built civilizations with just their raw brainpower and inner grit. But things have changed, and now comfort is king. Today we live in the thrall of constant climate control and exercise only when our office schedules permit. The technologies that we use to make us comfortable are so all-encompassing that they sever the biological link to a changing environment. Now we hate the cold and the heat. We suffer from autoimmune diseases. And many of us are chronically overweight. Most of us don't even realize that natural variation - sweating and shivering - is actually good for us. ", "What Doesn't Kill Us", " uncovers how just about anyone can reclaim a measure of our species' evolutionary strength by tapping in to the things that feel uncomfortable. When we slightly reimagine how our bodies fit into the world, we can condition ourselves to find resilience in unfamiliar environments. ", "The feeling that something is missing from our daily routines is growing and has spawned a movement. Every year millions of people forgo traditional gyms and push the limits of human endurance by doing boot camp-style workouts in raw conditions. These extreme athletes train in CrossFit boxes, compete in Tough Mudders, and challenge themselves in Spartan races. They are connecting with their environment and, whether they realize it or not, are changing their bodies. ", "No one exemplifies this better than Dutch fitness guru Wim Hof, whose remarkable ability to control his body temperature in extreme cold has sparked a whirlwind of scientific study. Because of him scientists in the United States and Europe are just beginning to understand how cold adaptation might help combat autoimmune diseases and chronic pain and, in some cases, even reverse diabetes. ", "Award-winning investigative journalist Scott Carney dives into the fundamental philosophy at the root of this movement in three interlocking narratives. His own journey culminates in a record-bending 28-hour climb up to the snowy peak of Mt. Kilimanjaro wearing nothing but a pair of running shorts and sneakers.

What emerged was a story wrought with sex, manipulation, and deceit that stunned the public at every turn. Arias, always playing the wronged and innocent woman, changed her story continually as her bizarre behavior surrounding the crime and its aftermath came to light. Unwavering, Arias and her defense team continued to play off the salacious details of the case, until she was finally found guilty and\u2014controversially\u2014sentenced to life behind bars.", "Now, speaking openly for the first time, prosecutor Juan Martinez will unearth new details from the investigation that were never revealed at trial, exploring key facts from the case and the pieces of evidence he chose to keep close to the vest. Throughout the trials, his bullish and unfaltering prosecution strategy was both commended and criticized, and in his book, Martinez will illuminate the unique tactics he utilized in this case and how they lead to a successful conviction, and-for the first time-discuss how he felt losing the death penalty sentence he\u2019d pursued for years.", "Going beyond the news reports, Martinez will explore the truth behind the multiple facades of Jodi Arias. Sparring with her from across the stand, Martinez came to know Arias like no one else could, dissecting what it took for a seemingly normal girl to become a deluded, cunning, and unrepentant murderer.", "With new stories from behind the scenes of the trial and Martinez\u2019s own take on his defendant, the book takes you inside the mind of Jodi Arias like never before. Complete with 16 pages of photos from the case and trial, this book is the definitive account of the case that shocked America.", "Enter your mobile number or email address below and we'll send you a link to download the free Kindle App. Then you can start reading Kindle books on your smartphone, tablet, or computer - no Kindle device required.

What was your initial theory of the crime based on what you saw that day?\n    ", "\n        Juan Martinez: The crime scene spoke to an over-kill. Travis Alexander had been fatally stabbed in the chest, his throat had been slit, and he had been shot in the temple. The scene also pointed to a struggle. Travis' blood was shed throughout the bathroom floor and on the sink, and streaked the walls of the hallway that lead to the master bedroom. This extreme violence was indicative of planning by whoever had brought both a knife and a gun to end Travis' life. It showed that the killer was someone who probably knew Travis and had a score to settle.\n    ", "\n        Q: What was the most damning piece of evidence uncovered during the investigation?\n    ", "\n        Juan Martinez: Jodi Ann Arias made the mistake of leaving Travis' camera behind after putting it in the washing machine and running the wash cycle. The deleted photographs that were recovered from the memory card of that camera proved that, contrary to her protestations, Arias was the killer because she was with him only minutes before one of the inadvertent photographs was snapped showing Travis face up in the bathroom hallway floor as blood streams from his throat.\n    ", "\n        Q: At what point did you start looking at Jodi Arias as your main suspect?\n    ", "\n        Juan Martinez: Jodi Arias was considered the only viable suspect from the first day of the investigation. Travis was well liked and his life was free of conflict, except for the problems with Arias. Friends of Travis were interviewed at the scene and they were quick to point out that she was clingy and was as a stalker.\n    ", "\n        Q: Jodi was notoriously combative during the trial, which you cover in detail in Conviction. What was your strategy with her during the trial?\n    ", "\n        Juan Martinez: I was criticized during my cross-examination of Jodi Ann Arias for utilizing an approach that was described as strident and harsh. But I had seen in her interview with Detective Esteban Flores after her arrest and during the direct examination in court that Arias would manipulate the truth if she was allowed to control the questioning. My strategy was to wrest control by directing the questioning in a firm manner rather than allowing her the chance to revise her story yet again.\n    ", "There's a problem loading this menu right now.", "Learn more about Amazon Prime."]},

But there's more to it than that. Throughout all of these examples--and in more that delve into the social benefits of lighter skin color, and the reasons for school achievement gaps--Gladwell invites conversations about the complex ways privilege manifests in our culture. He leaves us pondering the gifts of our own history, and how the world could benefit if more of our kids were granted the opportunities to fulfill their remarkable potential. --", "Mari Malcolm", "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "Signature", "Reviewed by", " Leslie ChangIn ", "Outliers", ", Gladwell (", "The Tipping Point", ") once again proves masterful in a genre he essentially pioneered\u2014the book that illuminates secret patterns behind everyday phenomena. His gift for spotting an intriguing mystery, luring the reader in, then gradually revealing his lessons in lucid prose, is on vivid display. ", "Outliers", " begins with a provocative look at why certain five-year-old boys enjoy an advantage in ice hockey, and how these advantages accumulate over time. We learn what Bill Gates, the Beatles and Mozart had in common: along with talent and ambition, each enjoyed an unusual opportunity to intensively cultivate a skill that allowed them to rise above their peers. A detailed investigation of the unique culture and skills of Eastern European Jewish immigrants persuasively explains their rise in 20th-century New York, first in the garment trade and then in the legal profession. Through case studies ranging from Canadian junior hockey champions to the robber barons of the Gilded Age, from Asian math whizzes to software entrepreneurs to the rise of his own family in Jamaica, Gladwell tears down the myth of individual merit to explore how culture, circumstance, timing, birth and luck account for success\u2014and how historical legacies can hold others back despite ample individual gifts. Even as we know how many of these stories end, Gladwell restores the suspense and serendipity to these narratives that make them fresh and surprising.One hazard of this genre is glibness. In seeking to understand why Asian children score higher on math tests, Gladwell explores the persistence and painstaking labor required to cultivate rice as it has been done in East Asia for thousands of years; though fascinating in its details, the study does not prove that a rice-growing heritage explains math prowess, as Gladwell asserts. Another pitfall is the urge to state the obvious: No one, Gladwell concludes in a chapter comparing a high-IQ failure named Chris Langan with the brilliantly successful J. Robert Oppenheimer, not rock stars, not professional athletes, not software billionaires and not even geniuses\u2014ever makes it alone. But who in this day and age believes that a high intelligence quotient in itself promises success? In structuring his book against that assumption, Gladwell has set up a decidedly flimsy straw man. In the end it is the seemingly airtight nature of Gladwell's arguments that works against him. His conclusions are built almost exclusively on the findings of others\u2014sociologists, psychologists, economists, historians\u2014yet he rarely delves into the methodology behind those studies. And he is free to cherry-pick those cases that best illustrate his points; one is always left wondering about the data he evaluated and rejected because it did not support his argument, or perhaps contradicted it altogether. Real life is seldom as neat as it appears in a Malcolm Gladwell book. ", "(Nov.)", "Leslie T.

She recommends two ongoing activities that will conquer blocks and self-destructive tendencies: morning pages and artist's dates. Morning pages are three pages of writing, performed daily, about anything at all. This exercise overcomes the writer's internal censor and makes writing habitual, she claims. The artist's date is a weekly block of two hours spent observing, experiencing, and sensing. The balance of the recording describes how the artist can overcome human tendencies such as jealousy, fear, and addiction. This abridgment leaves much to be desired. In her introduction, Cameron states that the audio is an interactive abridgment of her 12-week program. There is nothing interactive about it, however. The sound quality is poor, and the content is similar to the many available 12-step programs. In that sense, it is redundant and will appeal to a very small audience. Not recommended.?Joanna M.

And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great?", "The Standards:", "Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great?

Collins and his team of researchers began their quest by sorting through a list of 1,435 companies, looking for those that made substantial improvements in their performance over time. They finally settled on 11--including Fannie Mae, Gillette, Walgreens, and Wells Fargo--and discovered common traits that challenged many of the conventional notions of corporate success. Making the transition from good to great doesn't require a high-profile CEO, the latest technology, innovative change management, or even a fine-tuned business strategy. At the heart of those rare and truly great companies was a corporate culture that rigorously found and promoted disciplined people to think and act in a disciplined manner. Peppered with dozens of stories and examples from the great and not so great, the book offers a well-reasoned road map to excellence that any organization would do well to consider. Like ", "Built to Last", ", ", "Good to Great", " is one of those books that managers and CEOs will be reading and rereading for years to come. --", "Harry C. Edwards", "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "In what Collins terms a prequel to the bestseller Built to Last he wrote with Jerry Porras, this worthwhile effort explores the way good organizations can be turned into ones that produce great, sustained results. To find the keys to greatness, Collins's 21-person research team (at his management research firm) read and coded 6,000 articles, generated more than 2,000 pages of interview transcripts and created 384 megabytes of computer data in a five-year project. That Collins is able to distill the findings into a cogent, well-argued and instructive guide is a testament to his writing skills. After establishing a definition of a good-to-great transition that involves a 10-year fallow period followed by 15 years of increased profits, Collins's crew combed through every company that has made the Fortune 500 (approximately 1,400) and found 11 that met their criteria, including Walgreens, Kimberly Clark and Circuit City. At the heart of the findings about these companies' stellar successes is what Collins calls the Hedgehog Concept, a product or service that leads a company to outshine all worldwide competitors, that drives a company's economic engine and that a company is passionate about. While the companies that achieved greatness were all in different industries, each engaged in versions of Collins's strategies. While some of the overall findings are counterintuitive (e.g., the most effective leaders are humble and strong-willed rather than outgoing), many of Collins's perspectives on running a business are amazingly simple and commonsense. This is not to suggest, however, that executives at all levels wouldn't benefit from reading this book; after all, only 11 companies managed to figure out how to change their B grade to an A on their own.

And though we may sniff a bestselling formula, it is certainly not a new one: even the ancient tribal storytellers knew that this is the most successful method of entertaining an audience while slipping in a lesson or two. Brazilian storyteller Paulo Coehlo introduces Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who one night dreams of a distant treasure in the Egyptian pyramids. And so he's off: leaving Spain to literally follow his dream. ", "  Along the way he meets many spiritual messengers, who come in unassuming forms such as a camel driver and a well-read Englishman. In one of the Englishman's books, Santiago first learns about the alchemists--men who believed that if a metal were heated for many years, it would free itself of all its individual properties, and what was left would be the \"Soul of the World.\" Of course he does eventually meet an alchemist, and the ensuing student-teacher relationship clarifies much of the boy's misguided agenda, while also emboldening him to stay true to his dreams. \"My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer,\" the boy confides to the alchemist one night as they look up at a moonless night. ", "  \"Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself,\" the alchemist replies. \"And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity.\" ", "--Gail Hudson", "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t    \t", "This inspirational fable by Brazilian author and translator Coelho has been a runaway bestseller throughout Latin America and seems poised to achieve the same prominence here. The charming tale of Santiago, a shepherd boy, who dreams of seeing the world, is compelling in its own right, but gains resonance through the many lessons Santiago learns during his adventures. He journeys from Spain to Morocco in search of worldly success, and eventually to Egypt, where a fateful encounter with an alchemist brings him at last to self-understanding and spiritual enlightenment. The story has the comic charm, dramatic tension and psychological intensity of a fairy tale, but it's full of specific wisdom as well, about becoming self-empowered, overcoming depression, and believing in dreams. The cumulative effect is like hearing a wonderful bedtime story from an inspirational psychiatrist. Comparisons to The Little Prince are appropriate; this is a sweetly exotic tale for young and old alike. 50,000 first printing; $50,000 ad/promo.

It turns out, however, that a set of attitudes needn't be so set, according to Dweck, professor of psychology at Stanford. Dweck proposes that everyone has either a fixed mindset or a growth mindset. A fixed mindset is one in which you view your talents and abilities as... well, fixed. In other words, you are who you are, your intelligence and talents are fixed, and your fate is to go through life avoiding challenge and failure. A growth mindset, on the other hand, is one in which you see yourself as fluid, a work in progress. Your fate is one of growth and opportunity. Which mindset do you possess? Dweck provides a checklist to assess yourself and shows how a particular mindset can affect all areas of your life, from business to sports and love. The good news, says Dweck, is that mindsets are not set: at any time, you can learn to use a growth mindset to achieve success and happiness. This is a serious, practical book. Dweck's overall assertion that rigid thinking benefits no one, least of all yourself, and that a change of mind is always possible, is welcome.

According to historian Joseph Ellis,\u00a0", "Alexander Hamilton", "\u00a0is \u201ca robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.\u201d", "Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow\u2019s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today\u2019s America is the result of Hamilton\u2019s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. \u201cTo repudiate his legacy,\u201d Chernow writes, \u201cis, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.\u201d Chernow here recounts Hamilton\u2019s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington\u2019s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of America\u2019s birth as the triumph of Jefferson\u2019s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we\u2019ve encountered before\u2014from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton\u2019s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.", "Chernow\u2019s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America\u2019s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots,\u00a0", "Alexander Hamilton", "\u00a0will remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans.", "\u201cNobody has captured Hamilton better than Chernow\u201d\u00a0\u2014", "The New York Times Book Review", "\u00a0", " Sponsored Products are advertisements for products sold by merchants on Amazon.com.

", " ", "Building on biographies by ", "Richard Brookhiser", " and ", "Willard Sterne Randall", ", Ron Chernow\u0092s ", "Alexander Hamilton", " provides what may be the most comprehensive modern examination of the often overlooked Founding Father. From the start, Chernow argues that Hamilton\u0092s premature death at age 49 left his record to be reinterpreted and even re-written by his more long-lived enemies, among them: Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and James Monroe. Hamilton\u0092s achievements as first Secretary of the Treasury, co-author of ", "The Federalist Papers", ", and member of the Constitutional Convention were clouded after his death by strident claims that he was an arrogant, self-serving monarchist. Chernow delves into the almost 22,000 pages of letters, manuscripts, and articles that make up Hamilton\u0092s legacy to reveal a man with a sophisticated intellect, a romantic spirit, and a late-blooming religiosity.", "    One fault of the book, is that Chernow is so convinced of Hamilton\u0092s excellence that his narrative sometimes becomes hagiographic. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Chernow\u0092s account of the infamous duel between Hamilton and Aaron Burr in 1804. He describes Hamilton\u0092s final hours as pious, while Burr, Jefferson, and Adams achieve an almost cartoonish villainy at the news of Hamilton\u0092s passing. ", "   A defender of the union against New England secession and an opponent of slavery, Hamilton has a special appeal to modern sensibilities. Chernow argues that in contrast to Jefferson and Washington\u0092s now outmoded agrarian idealism, Hamilton was \"the prophet of the capitalist revolution\" and the true forebear of modern America. In his Prologue, he writes: \"In all probability, Alexander Hamilton is the foremost figure in American history who never attained the presidency, yet he probably had a much deeper and more lasting impact than many who did.\" With ", "Alexander Hamilton", ", this impact can now be more widely appreciated.

Morgan, the Warburgs and John D. Rockefeller, what other grandee of American finance was left for Chernow's overflowing pen than the one who puts the others in the shade? Alexander Hamilton (1755\u00961804) created public finance in the United States. In fact, it's arguable that without Hamilton's political and financial strategic brilliance, the United States might not have survived beyond its early years. Chernow's achievement is to give us a biography commensurate with Hamilton's character, as well as the full, complex context of his unflaggingly active life. Possessing the most powerful (though not the most profound) intelligence of his gifted contemporaries, Hamilton rose from Caribbean bastardy through military service in Washington's circle to historic importance at an early age and then, in a new era of partisan politics, gradually lost his political bearings. Chernow makes fresh contributions to Hamiltoniana: no one has discovered so much about Hamilton's illegitimate origins and harrowed youth; few have been so taken by Hamilton's long-suffering, loving wife, Eliza. Yet it's hard not to cringe at some of Hamilton's hotheaded words and behavior, especially sacrificing the well-being of his family on the altar of misplaced honor. This is a fine work that captures Hamilton's life with judiciousness and verve. Illus.  ", "Copyright \u00a9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
