Review.", "  Grade 9 Up\u2013Zusak has created a work that deserves the attention of sophisticated t     een and adult readers. Death himself narrates the World War
II-era story of Liesel Meminger from the time she is taken, at age nine, to live in Molching, Germany, with a fost     er family in a working-class neighborhood of
tough kids, acid-tongued mothers, and loving fathers who earn their living by the work of their hands. The child arrives having j     ust stolen her first
book\u2013although she has not yet learned how to read\u2013and her foster father uses it, ", "The Gravediggers Handbook", ", to lull her to sleep when s     hes
roused by regular nightmares about her younger brothers death. Across the ensuing years of the late 1930s and into the 1940s, Liesel collects more stolen books as
well as      a peculiar set of friends: the boy Rudy, the Jewish refugee Max, the mayors reclusive wife (who has a whole library from which she allows Liesel to
steal), and especially he     r foster parents. Zusak not only creates a mesmerizing and original story but also writes with poetic syntax, causing readers to
deliberate over phrases and lines, even as th     e action impels them forward. Death is not a sentimental storyteller, but he does attend to an array of satisfying
details, giving Liesels story all the nuances of chance, fo     lly, and fulfilled expectation that it deserves. An extraordinary narrative.", "\u2013Francisca
